Dead West from Gigantic Graphic Novels is just such a book.  A blending of spaghetti western and zombie films...Clint Eastwood meets George Romero.<br />Produced by Rick Spears & Rob Goodridge, Dead West takes these two unique film genres and blends them together for one horrific ride.<br /><br />The story opens as a group of Native American Indians warmly welcomes the white man into their small village, only to have the white men lay claim to the lands.  The men return as raiders, killing all of the Indians except for the young son of the tribe's chief who escapes.  Move forward a number of years to the town of Lazarus on the very land stolen from the Native Americans.  That lone survivor of the raid, now a man, performs a ghoulish ritual atop the Lazarus cemetery, taking his own life and letting his blood spill over the graves.  Soon the dead claw their way out of the ground, and shuffle forth towards the town, led by the same Indian Shaman, now returned to life himself, to avenge his tribe.<br /><br />The residents of Lazarus now find themselves under attack by the undead zombies, and returning to life when they die themselves to attack their former friends and neighbors.  The survivors take refuge where they can and try to fight off the living dead as a mysterious man, looking remarkably like Clint Eastwood from one of his spaghetti westerns, comes to town in search of a man with a price on his head, and finds himself caught up in this hellish struggle with the dead.<br /><br />I am always a sucker for a good zombie story and Dead West certainly was that.  The black & white art, while not remarkable, was very reminiscent of the kind of art in the old Warren horror magazines like Creepy or Eerie back in the day.  In fact the art somewhat reminded me of Pat Boyette's work on those same magazines from the 60's and 70's.  I also like the fact that dialog was kept to a minimum as Spears and Goodridge let the visuals tell the story.  There's nothing worse than a story that gets too \\"talky\\", especially a horror story.  They have a very good handle on the zombie concept and a good flair for the dramatic as well.  A very well done story and I look forward to seeing more from this pair.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonrs and Goodridge let the visuals tell the story.

Many people are often unaware of the colorful pasts of their own town.  That's why it's so great to have a publisher like Arcadia Press around.  Their specialty is publishing books about regional history and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the city in which I live is the subject of one of their outstanding books.<br /><br />I've always known that the City of Westland, and formerly Nankin Township had a long history and was an area that featured a large population of Indians back before settlers arrived in the early 1800's.  As a kid my friends and I rode the nature trails in Hines Park which had names like the Tonquish Trail.  Chief Tonquish was a Potawatomi Indian who was the leader of the tribe that lived along the banks of the Rouge River.  As more settlers began infringing on Indian lands it led to skirmishes between the two factions.  In one violent episode the Chief and his son were killed. A marker stands today at the site of Tonquishe's burial site.<br /><br />As with all of Arcadia's books, fantastic archival photography is included and it's always amazing to see these very old photos.  Included is a photo of the Reverend Marcus Swift, one of the area's earliest settlers who came to the area in 1825.  Swift is buried in Newburgh Cemetary, the oldest cemetery in the area.  One of the most famous buildings in all of Westland is the Nankin Mills building first built in 1863 and still standing today.  The build was purchased by the Ford Motor Co. in 1918 and used by them until 1947.  However most modern Westland residents remember it as the Nature Center which opened in 1958 as a local wildlife preserve.  This was a frequent field trip destination for local elementary schools throughout the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn so many facts about my town which I never knew.  Such as that it was Henry Ford who built the one room school house located at Farmington Rd. and Ann Arbor Trail, and later had a larger, full elementary school added on called Perrinville, which is where I went to school.  One of the great success stories of Westland is the Westland Mall.  Built in 1965 the mall continues to thrive at a time when other area malls have gone out of business or are struggling.<br /><br />This was a great trip down memory lane for me to revisit so many of places and sites that I frequented as a child and to learn about the history of my hometown.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonool house located at Farmington Rd. and Ann Arbor Trail, and later had a larger, full elementary school added on called Perrinville, which is where I went to school.

None was consistently funny over the years as Calvin & Hobbes.  It's hard to believe that it's been 10 years since Watterson retired.  It's my understanding that he is living in sem-seclusion, very rarely granting interviews (although he did for the release of this set) and spending his time painting with no desire to return to a full-time strip.  His enigmatic departure at the height of the strip's popularity will forever cement his fame.  He's the Barry Sanders and Jim Brown of Comic strips.  It's like if Charles Schulz had abruptly retired in the early 1970's.<br /><br />The Detroit Free Press has just begun reprinting Calvin & Hobbes strips and will continue for the rest of the year.  This is a great thing for perhaps younger readers who may not have been familiar with the characters.  The strip is so simple really...a boy and his stuffed tiger who Calvin imagines (or does he?) comes to life when just the two of them are together.  Calvin's over-active imagination takes them on a wild ride of adventures but some of the very best strips are when the pair are just lying about, philosophizing about life in general or picking out shapes in the clouds.<br /><br />My personal favorites were always the holiday strips, expecially the Christmas strips as Calvin was always scheming for presents or to catch Santa as he comes down the chimney.  I still love reading those.  This set collects every Calvin & Hobbes strip.  All ten years worth in a handsome three volume set.  It's a great collectors item but it's also great for reading.  It's definitely cheaper to buy this complete set than to try and buy all of the smaller collection books.  A fantastic Christmas present.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson	2005-10-11

The main character is a gorgeous, scantily clad female.  Not that I have anything against gorgeous, scantily clad females, but when a book features dozens of splash pages, many of them two-page splash pages, it's usually a sign that the book is all glitz and eye-candy and lacking any story.  But a funny thing happened as I read this trade paperback collecting issues #1 - 4 of the series...I liked it.  I really liked it!  (with apologies to Sally Field).<br /><br />In a futuristic society where nearly all humans have some synthetic parts of some kind, Aphrodite is unique.  She is totally synthetic and was created in a lab.  Only she doesn't know it.  Created to be an ultra powerful assassin and to carry out the whims of the head of the Council, Aphrodite kills without remorse or feeling and does so brazenly and with incredible efficiency.  And, 15 minutes after her missions, she completely forgets them, retaining no memory of what she did or even what she is.  Her first hints come when she leaves herself a recording, prior to forgetting.  Then, she slowly begins to remember things in her dreams.  She remembers the people she's killed and she remembers the Council and the man she affectionately called \\"daddy\\" the scientist who created her.<br /><br />The more she remembers the more of a conscience she develops over her actions.  Aphrodite, the unstoppable assassin, fighting off security forces and a powerful cyborg named Abraxis, begins to piece together the clues of her mysterious life and finally comes face-to-face with the head of the council and learns all the secrets of her deadly past.<br /><br />Writer David Wohl borrows some themes from films and TV such as \\"The Matrix\\",  \\"The 6th day\\" and \\"Dark Angel\\" and comes up with an effective, if not altogether, original story.  I did find myself engrossed in Aphrodite's search for her background and the reason why she forgets her missions 15 minutes after completion.  Dave Finch's artwork is simply striking.  Yes there are a lot of splash pages but it is great stuff.  He shows Aphrodite as the perfect, sexy, yet vulnerable and confused and manipulated killer that she is.  The trade paperback also reprints all of the variant covers that were included in the regular comic series and a brief sketch gallery.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonminutes after completion.

This was something with a decidedly different look.  Oh sure, there's a beautiful, nude woman on the cover, but upon opening up the book I was surprised at what I found there.  Walter Girotto was a totally unknown artist to me until I got this book.  Girotto is an Italian artist who came to the United States back in 1985.  I hesitate to categorize him as a pin-up or erotic artists, although his work certainly has those qualities.  But Girotto is something more.  Working in oils, pastels, even crayon and colored pencil, his work produced on wood gives it an aged, textured, grainy look.  He blends a Renaissance period look with 21st century eroticism to create a completely unique style.  Going beyond traditional pin-up art, Girotto's work really classifies as fine art.<br /><br />His different methods and tools produce some startling work, and it's really unlike anything I've ever seen.  Take the piece simply called \\"Nude 30\\" showing a radiant blonde that was finished with colored pencil on prepared paper.  I don't think that paper was prepared for Girotto!  \\"Shauna Wearing Red Boots\\" features the beautiful subject lying nude on a divan clad in only red boots.  These pieces complement his smooth, soft style perfectly.<br /><br />I love a painting called \\"Unconcerned\\" in which Girotto combines oils and pastels on this seductive woman with full, pouty lips and eyes closed.  \\"Love Temptation\\" seems derived right out of the 1500's with the nude blonde subject holding a bunch of pink roses while a cherub hovers over her shoulder.  Julie Strain has never looked quite so refined as she does in \\"Julie Strain Portrait\\" showing the scream queen amidst of Renaissance Era sculptures with a cherub lying at her feet.<br /><br />Throughout the 100 plus page collection you'll find yourself mesmerized at this incredibly talented artists who has taken eroticism to a whole other level.

As a person who used to love to draw, Nestler makes me never want to pickup a pencil again.  He's just too damn good.  I don't think it would be a stretch to call him the finest pin-up artist working today.  Dave's got it rough, too.  He has all of these beautiful models come in to pose nude for him...nice work if you can get it.  \\"Bad Girls Ride Again\\" is the second Dave Nestler sketch book from SQP and contains another 64 pages of his outstanding pencil work.  His work combines a traditional pin-up feel with modern day eroticism.  I dare you to try to find one bad piece in this book.  Gosh I really hate this guy!<br /><br />Nestler's ability to capture a photo-realistic look in just pencil is simply extraordinary.  He's one of the very few artists whose drawings look every bit as good, and are every bit as frameable as their finished paintings.  His women radiate sexiness!  Take the beauty on page 7 dressed in a fishnet top and thigh high leather boots, or Nestler's \\"police woman\\" dressed in short, almost no-shorts and a mini-top.  This is one cop you'd kill to get stripped-searched by.  Then there is that home-spun country girl on page 17 that captures that \\"Mary Ann\\" look.<br /><br />A two page spread shows a woman lying on a bed, wrapped in leather straps.  There are actually a whole series of pieces with this theme and you can see the actual photographs of the models on Nestler's website.  I also love the two page, centerfold-style spread featuring a drop dead gorgeous blonde riding a stool backwards.  Another great two pager is the Hawaiian girl with her clamshell bikini top and grass skirt.  Like I said...I dare you to find one piece that doesn't make your jaw drop.<br /><br />The book also features a preliminary sketch section where you can see many of the rough sketches that Nestler used for many of his finished paintings so you can compare the two.  Included are a number of sketches from the \\"leather strap\\" series.  This is an absolute must have for any Nestler fan or any fan of pinup or erotic art.

The Spanish-born artist would first make a name for himself working on various comic strips and other projects in the UK.  We would later begin working on the Warren line of magazines such as Eerie, Creepy, and most notably Vampirella.  Roca passed away suddenly in 1998 but left behind a wonderful legacy of beautiful women and fantasy art.  Thanks to SQP, Roca's work is being preserved and reaching many new fans.<br /><br />This collection is represents a marvelous sampling of his pencil work.  Roca's style is the very essence of heroic swords & sorcery with larger than life heroes, evil villains, and buxom, gorgeous women.  The book has several of Roca's Conan drawings and very few artists outside of Frazetta and maybe Boris were able to capture the power and savagery of Robert E. Howard's barbarian hero the Roca did.  Page 10 features perhaps my favorite Conan piece in the book as he squares off against a giant spider to rescue a girl while a wizard lurks menacingly in the background.  It's a great piece!<br /><br />The Art of Roca isn't all about Swords & Sorcery however.  As mentioned, this is really a sampling of Roca's art and thus features a diversity of drawings.  There are historical drawings drawing on Roman and pirate themes, as well a number of gothic-themed drawings.  My favorite is perhaps the group of zombies that are lumbering about under a fog-shrouded moon.  There are also several finished pieces that feature samurai, gunslingers, and hard-boiled detectives.  The book completes with several pages of nude sketches including one of Roca's favorite subjects, Vampirella.  Included are several dominatrix-themed sketches with leather clad women bearing whips and ready for action.<br /><br />In this book, Roca shows that he had the talent to work in any genre.  There's no doubt that he would have gone on to even greater fame had it not been for his untimely passing at the relatively young age of 58.

While the front and back covers to theses volumes have been produced digitally, the interiors show off Ryman's outstanding pencil work in both preliminary sketch and finished examples.  Beautiful Creatures doesn't really tell the whole story however.  Ryman's women are sometimes bold and ballsy, sometimes dark and seductive, and sometime playful and demure.  His gorgeous women are often in contrast to the Hellish creatures that surround them.<br /><br />Ryman's beasts are some of the most imaginative I've ever seen.  Grotesque demons, gargantuan insectoids, and ravenous undead populate his art, sometimes serving; other times being served, by lovely women.  There are several eye-popping, two-page spreads in the book.  One of my favorites shows a nude captive female being led by two slug-like creatures to their immense leader...perhaps as a meal or something worse!<br /><br />Another great two-page spread depicts a spider queen accompanied by a brutish half-ape, half spider beast, surrounded by a horde of smaller spiders.  I also love the piece of the nude woman riding atop the back of a giant crocodile.  Ryman can also do some fantastic pin-up-style art but with his own gruesome twist.  One in particular shows his female subject holding a devilishly leering pumpkin.  I also love the drawing showing a chaotic warrior in the foreground with the burning \\"wickerman\\" in the background.  By the way, the Wicker Man is a great film!<br /><br />There's a lot of work in this 64 page book.  While Ryman has worked in video game development as well as for the RPG industry, many of his sketches look like the kind of production drawings used for designs in film.  I would not be surprised if that is the next media format he decides to conquer.  If you never seen his work before I highly recommend picking up both this and the second volume in the series.eries. <br />	2005-10-06

I'm pretty sure I owned all, or just about all of these titles.  The Giant-size books were always special and were basically annuals.  For some reason marvel stopped doing annuals and did these Giant-sized books for a few years before going back to annuals.  Obviously the most famous story in this collection is from Giant-size X-men #1 which was the first appearance of the new X-men by Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum.  It may be the single most important comic of the Bronze Age and introduced fans to Storm, Nightcrawler, Colossus, Thunderbird and also included Wolverine, and Banshee.<br /><br />Giant-Size Fantastic Four #4 introduced Jamie Madrox, the Multiple Man who could duplicate himself whenever he was hit hard enough.  madrox was a mutant who would later be a member of X-Factor.<br /><br />Giant-size Defenders #4 featured a battle between the Defenders and the Squadron Sinister, who were Marvel's version of the Justice League.<br /><br />Giant Size Super Heroes #1 is one of the earliest books in this collection and fatures Spiderman battliing Morbius The Living Vampire and Man-Wolf.<br /><br />Giant Size Invaders #1 I think came out before Invaders #1.  This was basically a re-teaming of the golden Age All Winners and they were still fighting WWII.  Terrible artwork from Frank Robbins makes this tough to read.<br /><br />Giant Size Creatures features one of Marvels trio of big horror characters from the 1970's, the WereWolf by Night.<br /><br />Giant Size Avengers were normally always good but this was probably the worst, featuring the All Winners squad and a story by the dependable Roy Thomas.<br /><br />All in all this is a pretty decent collection.  I'm not sure how much interest there is among modern comic buyers but for fans from the 1970's it's a nice bit of nostalgia.  Funny thing is, that with the exception of the X-men issue, you could actually get all of these original comics for less than the price of this book as long as you're not looking for them in near mint shape.

I'm sure he'd probably be the first to admit that fact.  His art is simplistic and unrefined.  Brown's true talent is as a writer and in conveying those painful, real-life emotions and experiences that we all go through.  Brown has always allowed readers to get a glimpse into his life to see the good, the bad, and the painful.<br /><br />Sometimes sweet, sometimes insightful, and sometimes agonizing in it's sheer emotion, his latest work, \\"An Easy Intimacy\\" is a book-length tale of an up and down, and then really down, relationship between Jeffrey and Sophia.  Jeffrey is a video store clerk, in his twenties who is introduced to Sophia, a younger, bohemian type.  Their relationship progresses from playful petting to their first night of sex where Sophia admits to it being her first time...with a man.  Over the course of the 200 plus page book, the story unfolds in an episodic format with one no more than two or three pages devoted to a single segment.  These segments can be wildly disjointed in their tone and one makes the assumption that this was also the case between Jeffrey and Sophia.  Still, if I can find one thing to nitpick with it would be rapid fire scene changes which seem to leave some issues unresolved.<br /><br />Sophia suffers from bouts of depression and threatens to hurt herself as she had in the past.  She at once seems to be deeply depressed every time they have sex, and yet she often is the one who initiates it with Jeffrey, leading to ever growing frustration on his part.  She further frustrates Jeffrey by having coffee with another guy claiming it's just as friends.  Men know full well it's rarely just as friends.  It's truly excruciating watching their relationship's highs and lows because it is so very true to life.  There are certainly aspects that all of us can identify with.<br /><br />Crude art aside, Brown is certainly skilled at drawing on life's experiences to put the reader on an emotional rollercoaster.

Rather than being broken up by type of project it's segmented by region and era to present its unique projects.

There are instructions for making painted egg ornaments, a variety of traditional wreaths, and, of course, gingerbread houses.<br /><br />The next chapter features songs, stories, projects and recipes with a Victorian flair which utilize materials such as pine cones, cinnamon sticks, pepper grass and dried berries.  A quick, easy, and elegant way to dress up the house is to adorn things like throw pillows and tables with gold and cream colored ribbons and bows.  Dress up plain glass ornaments with accents of pine, small pine cones or gold cording.  There are some terrific gingerbread house projects based on actual Victorian buildings such as the Avonlea Inn.<br /><br />Country continues to be an extremely popular theme among crafters who want to capture that simple, yet rustic look.  One such project is a pine and baby's breath swag that would look great hung from your mantle.  Jazz up your home's country antiques by decorating them with plaid fabric or other similarly country-themed materials.  A magnificent recipe for a gingerbread log cabin is featured in this chapter.<br /><br />Other chapters cover themes like a Southwestern Christmas, an International Christmas and a \\"Not Quite Grown Up Christmas\\", all featuring their own distinctive projects and recipes.

The projects are all presented with full materials list and with step-by-step instructions along with vibrant full cover photography of each project and patterns where applicable.<br /><br />One simple, yet dazzling idea was the Beaded Icicle Ornaments, made by stringing different colors and sizes of glass beads along a brass wire and hung by a brass hook.  They capture the lights from tree and shimmer magnificently.  You can go in the opposite direction by capturing a rustic look by cutting out copper ornaments and stamping them with various phrases or perhaps the names of family members.  My wife is very big into snowmen so the Painted Ceramic Snowmen Mugs were right up her alley.  Made with simple and inexpensive coffee mugs that you can buy from dollar stores you can jazz them up with enamel paints and glaze.  Four snowmen patterns and color schemes are included.<br /><br />Candles are very big today and especially around the holidays where scented candles of pine, cinnamon, and other traditional holiday scents are the order of the day.  But you can dress up those simple glass candles by wrapping them in a lush beaded wreath made from various sized beads, strung together by a wire of a matching color.  It truly gives the candles a stylish appeal.  If you're looking for Old-style appeal, why not try the Victorian Favor Cups.  These are cones that are made with Bristol board, and then decorated with various scraps of holiday fabrics, ribbons, cords, or other such dressing and then filled with candies or other goodies and hung from the tree.  These make extra special treats for kids on Christmas morning or perhaps on Christmas Eve.<br /><br />The projects range in degree of difficulty from very simple to moderately complex and all are only moderately expensive in terms of the materials cost.  A very well presented book...just in time for the Christmas Season.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson/> <br />The projects range in degree of difficulty from very simple to moderately complex and all are only moderately expensive in terms of the materials cost.

This book is one reason why not EVERY story arc needs to be collected into a trade paperback.  I suppose it's great for the people who aren't reading each issue faithfully and it IS cheaper, but I've always looked at trades as collecting the better storylines.<br /><br />Syndicate Rules tackles the old familiar DC storyline of counter worlds and parallel characters.  This time it deals with the Anti-matter world and the Crime Syndicate of Amerika and their counterparts of Super Woman (Wonder Woman), Ultraman (Superman) Power Ring (Green Lantern), Johnny Quick (The Flash) and Owlman (Batman).  The CSA has taken over the free peoples of their world and rules with a sadistic fist but the group is bored.  They are looking for new challenges to their might but soon learn a startling revelation that their very existence continues to be destroyed and recreated in a never-ending loop, a situation they trace to the JLA.  They hatch a plot to come to our world and take over the League's identity and then send the JLA back to their ant-matter world, trapping them there forever.  Meanwhile, the warlike planet Qward, themselves victims of the CSA, unleash their most powerful, planet destroying weapon, and head to destroy the CSA and anything that gets in their way.<br /><br />The whole idea of these parallel worlds has always been a staple of DC lore but unfortunately this story collapses under its own weight of convoluted plotlines and sub-plotlines and a host of characters.  Kurt Busiek, one of my favorite comic writers, just tries to squeeze a bit (well actually a lot) too much into the story.  The plot would have stood well on it's own with just the CSA angle without the sub-plot of the attacking Qward which only serves to bog down the action.  Add to that is the fact that so much space is devoted to the CSA and the Qward that the JLA barely shows up for more than a cameo in their own title.  Toss in a bunch of reserve JLAers like Major Disaster, Captain Marvel, Red Tornado, and you have one confusing, overblown story.  Little is developed from the Qward point of view and they become just some generic alien race.  The CSA start out as wickedly and murderously evil but by the end of the story they've become caricatures.<br /><br />It seems evident that rather that trying to dazzle readers with brilliance Busiek has instead tried to baffle us with BS.ir own title.

The Astounding B Monster is one of the best site on the internet for fans of \\"b\\" movies and cult films.  Culled from the fantastic website, author Marty Baumann presents 26 interviews with the filmmakers and actors responsible for some of the most famous (and infamous) \\"B\\" films in history.  While many of the interview subjects may not be household names, the films they were associated with will forever live on in cinema lore.<br /><br />Take James Arness for example.  Arness IS a household name from his two decades in the starring role of Marshal Dillon on Gunsmoke.  But it was the Sci-Fi film \\"The Thing from Another World\\" that gave the young Arness his first big break in Hollywood.  At  a time when doing a horror or sci-fi film was considered a step down for most actors, Arness relished the opportunity to work with noted Director/Producter Howard Hawks and has nothing but fond memories of his role.  He tells a hilarious story about getting out of a limo in full \\"Thing\\" make-up and buying a newspaper from a terrified street vendor.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell has moved from \\"B\\" list actor to a major Hollywood star but it was in Sam Raimi's deliciously gore-filled and darkly humorous \\"Evil Dead\\" films that the lantern-jawed star first made his name.  Among other tidbits, Campbell explains the credits attributed to \\"fake Shemps\\" in these films.<br /><br />The late Alex Gordon was a producer and screenwriter.  He produced such films as \\"The Day the World Ended\\", \\"The She Creature\\", and \\"Voodoo Woman\\" and also wrote the screenplay for the last complete film that Bela Lugosi starred in, \\"The Bride of the Monster\\".  Gordon takes issue with Tim Burton's Biopic of Ed Wood, specifically saying that Lugosi never used the kind of profanity that Burton had the character use and never spoke disparagingly about Boris Karloff.<br /><br />The late Leo Gordon was a tough-guy actor noted for his roles in westerns such McLinktock! with John Wayne.  But Gordon also had a an incredible list of writing credits including such \\"B\\" classics as \\"Attack of the Giant Leeches\\", \\"The Wasp Woman\\", and \\"The Terror\\" for Roger Corman.<br /><br />Other subjects interviewed in the book include Anne Francis from \\"Forbidden Planet\\", Fess Parker of \\"Them\\", Lori Nelson of \\"Revenge of the Creature\\" and 50's and 60's blonde bombshell, Mamie Van Doren.<br /><br />The reviews are short but informative and very fun.  Baumann does a wonderful job of keeping alive some of the forgotten names of \\"B\\" movie lore.

This is the third volume in SQP's Erotic collection of art, photography, and comic strip art.  The Artcore books are decidedly more explicit than most of the material from SQP and as such is for mature adults only.  What certainly sets the Artcore series apart is its eclectic blend of different forms of erotic material.  Robi is Co-owner of the German comic book publishing house \\"Schwarzer Turm\\" which publishes translated versions of famous comic books such as \\"Usagi Yojimbo\\" as well as comics of German artists. Alraune is an explicit comic written by Robi with art by Toni Gries.  A short Alraune strip leads off this volume.  Next is the photo section featuring nude model Jana who has posed for erotic artist Drew Posada.  This is a 12 page, very explicit spread featuring this beautiful, blonde model.  The photography is first-rate and the close-ups are brilliantly clear.<br /><br />The last two-thirds of Artcore feature erotic pin-up art from some of the top talents in the business including John Hul, Lorenzo DiMauro, Sonia Roji, Marcus Gray, Pete Tapang, Cane Hoyer and more.  If you've never seen the work of Erik Drudwyn he's perhaps the most dazzling of the modern erotic artist whose work is photo-realistic genius.  Drudwyn provides four painting including the eye-popping piece called \\"Stardust\\" featuring a red hot blonde virtually shimmering in all her glory.<br /><br />Oliver Schramm provides four darkly haunting, black & white pieces and Andreas Raufeisen provides six pages of erotic bondage art.  Finally Michael Dutkiewicz, another top talent provides not only the cover to Artcore Volume 3, but a half-dozen interior paintings including \\"Solar Flare\\" featuring a nude fire-eater and the self-explanatory \\"Pole Dancer\\".  This is truly an international production.  The book is 80 pages in full color printed on heavy, glossy stock.  This is definitely the stronger stuff but a very polished presentation.<br /><br />Reviewed By Tim Janson	2005-10-03

Tom Weaver proves again why he is one of the most knowledgeable people in the business when if comes to genre films with \\"I Was a Monster Movie Maker\\".  In this book Weaver presents 22 interviews with Sci-Fi and Monster movie makers both behind and in front of the camera.  While a fan, Weaver's interviews are never \\"fannish\\" in nature.  He not only knows the talent but knows their work, often times, it seems, better than the subject themselves.<br /><br />Phil Brown is best known as Uncle Owen from Star Wars, but did his first film back in 1941.  Brown admits to taking the Star Wars role because \\"it was a job\\" and he had no idea what it was about, although he says George Lucas' genius was evident from the beginning.  It's also interesting that Brown did a move (The Weird Woman) with Lon Chaney Jr. back in the 1940's.  While he fondly recalls Chaney, he never joined him in his morning \\"spirits\\".<br /><br />Candace Hilligoss discusses her role in one of the most atmospheric and underrated low-budget horror, \\"Carnival of Souls\\", and how she was forced out of the eventual remake even though it was largely her idea.  She would eventually be offered a cameo but turned it down.<br /><br />One of the best interviews was with Maureen O' Sullivan, best known as playing Jane in a number of Tarzan films.  Still sharp as a tack, she relates a number of amusing anecdotes about playing Jane including stories about the skimpy jungle outfit and how she refused to do a nude scene in a silhouette.  She also said that despite the rumors, there was never a romance between she and Tarzan co-star Johnny Weismuller.<br /><br />Another fantastic interview was with Ray Walston.  Walston played Uncle Martin in the hit 1960's series \\"My Favorite Martian\\" but many people probably don't know that he played Renfield in the Broadway stage version of Dracula with Bela Lugosi.  Walston has some wonderful stories about being out on the town drinking with Lugosi, who, ever frugal, would bring his own flask of scotch.  Walston was positively ecstatic to relate how Lugosi told him he was the best Renfield he had ever had. High praise indeed!<br /><br />Shirley Ulmer also has some interesting stories about Lugosi from the set of \\"The Black Cat\\" where her husband Edgar was the director.  She talks about the tension between Lugosi and Karloff and the grueling 16 hour days of filming to get the picture done on time.<br /><br />Other interviews include Dana Wynter from \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\", Yvonne Lime from \\"I was a Teenage Werewolf\\", Phyllis Kirk from \\"The House of Wax\\" and Michael Hoey, the Director of legendary \\"B\\" film \\"The Navy Vs. the Night Monsters.\\"  This is another outstanding effort from Weaver and a first rate production by McFarland Books.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonhis own flask of scotch.

And this book is nearly as outstanding as the 30's book.  I say nearly only because the 1930's produced such pioneering classics of the genre like Frankenstein, King Kong, The Mummy, and Dracula, while in the 1940's, horror films had become almost exclusively \\"B\\" films.  Mank has meticulously researched not only the films these actresses starred in, but their entire career, providing a filmography for each.<br /><br />The Beautiful Evelyn Ankers is hailed as the top scream queen of the 1940's, starring in classics like \\"The Wolfman\\" and \\"Ghost of Frankenstein\\", and not so classics like \\"Son of Dracula\\", \\"The Mad Ghoul\\" and \\"Weird Woman.\\"  Lon Chaney Jr., always a bit of a gruff individual, delighted in scaring Evelyn when he was in full Jack Pierce Wolfman makeup.<br /><br />Peggy Moran starred in only one horror, \\"The Mummy's Hand\\" which was the first, and best sequel to the 1932 classic.  It's interesting to not that Moran actually met actor Tom Tyler, who played the mummy Kharis, out of his mummy makeup due to shooting schedules.  Anne Gwynne is another interesting actress who did a number of horror films including \\"Black Friday\\", the 1941 \\"Black Cat\\" and \\"House of Frankenstein.\\" Gwynne speaks fondly of \\"House of Frankenstein\\", particularly of her scenes with John Carradine who played Dracula.  She felt it was one of her best performances.<br /><br />One of my favorite actresses to read about was the sensuous Louise Albritton.  Her most noted role was playing opposite Chaney Jr. in \\"Son of Dracula\\", and completely stealing the show.  As the morbid southern Belle Kay Caldwell, she actually weds the count but plans on betraying him to live the life immortal with another man.  It is Albritton that really carries this film as Chaney was terribly miscast.<br /><br />While Albritton probably gets the nod for greatest Femme Fatale of the 1940's, the nod for single most chilling scene goes to Virginia Christine.  Playing the reincarnated Princess Ananka in \\"The Mummy's Curse\\", she rises from the muck and mud of a bayou swamp, looking like a zombie out of a George Romero film.  It's a very effective and well done scene.<br /><br />Other women highlighted in the book include Elena Vedrugo, the beautiful gypsy girl from \\"House of Frankenstein\\"; Lenore Aubert from \\"Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein\\", Simone Simon from Val Lewton's Classi \\"Cat People\\" and Jane Adams, who had this distinction of playing the only female hunchback in classic horror history in \\"House of Dracula\\".<br /><br />The book is filled with many great photos from these films as well as many photos of the actresses today.  They provide many amusing and informational anecdotes and this book is a must have for fans of classic horror.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonts the nod for greatest Femme Fatale of the 1940's, the nod for single most chilling scene goes to Virginia Christine.

Around the house there's big pictures of Ronald Reagan hanging on the walls.<br /><br />I'm sure the left is getting their undies all in a bunch over the book, especially the tagline about how the book is a way for parents to teach their children the valuable lessons of conservativism.  Look it's just a gag.  It's a book written for adults as a parody.  No one is going to use this to teach their kids about liberals or conservatives.  Instead of getting all worked up, just enjoy it as a bit of sarcasm and have a good laugh like I did.	2005-09-28

In a field loaded with some extremely talented artists, Sperlonga is one of the very best, drawing and painting some of the most beautiful women ever put on paper.  This 104 page, full color collection from SQP collects some of the greatest works from the Italian artist.  Sperlonga was \\"discovered\\" by Kevin Eastman, publisher of Heavy Metal and co-creator of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  Eastman was blown away by the lush, detailed, photo-realistic quality of Sperlonga's work.  What I love about him is how diversified he is, being able to cross-genres from standard pin-up-style art, to fantasy, sci-fi, and horror with relative ease.  He infuses his works with eroticism and an enticing wit.<br /><br />Take a piece called \\"Angel Baby\\" showing a rather beleaguered blonde angel, sitting at a table drinking Jack Daniels with a cigarette burning in an ash tray.  It's a fantastic piece providing tremendous fodder for conversation regarding its interpretation.  \\"Come out and Play\\" features identical twin sisters, armed with aluminum baseball bats, ready for action...and I doubt it's baseball they're in the mood for.  \\"Welcome to Hell\\" features scream queen, and Eastman's wife Julie Strain (damn but that man is lucky\\" along with the Porcelain Twins, as the official door greeters in Hell.  This was taken from a Heavy Metal cover.<br /><br />\\"The Mirror\\" is a tricky, creative painting as a topless woman dries herself off after a shower, and yet in the mirror, you only see the towel, seemingly hanging in mid air, as the woman casts no reflection herself.  Sperlonga takes a stab at pop culture with \\"Hannibal's Revenge\\" showing Jodie Foster as Agent Starling, clad in a straight jacket and locked in a padded cell.<br /><br />One of my favorite paintings in the entire collection is \\"The Mummy\\" showing a gorgeous mummy who has just returned to life.  The use of light and shadow in this piece is just flawless.  The way the light shimmers off the walls is mesmerizing.  Lizzy Strain (half-sister to Julie) models for \\"Lizzy Goes to London\\" standing with an assault rifle in front of the Union Jack, flipping the bird.  Buxom Anna Nicole Smith poses in a see through top, sitting on a pool table, in a painting entitled \\"Saloon Kitty.\\"<br /><br />The book provides a sketch, pencil and ink section and Lorenzo takes you through the creative process from rough draft to completed paintings.  A comprehensive index gives a thumbnail of each piece including the name, medium and model name.  Contrary to the other review, I will tell you that the book is printed on high quality, slick, glossy paper and is just a beautiful book.

Checker has been taking classic comic strips and collecting them into book form and bringing characters like Flash Gordon, Steve Canyon, and Dick Tracy to a whole new generation of fans.  Another project that Checker has undertaken is reprinting the works of legendary, early 20th century cartoonist Winsor McCay, creator of Little Nemo in Slumberland.<br /><br />As little Nemo has seen frequent re-printings over the years, Checker is reprinting all of McCay's other works including his other strips as well as editorial cartoons.  This is the fourth in what will eventually be an eleven volume set of these works, and most of this work is seeing print for the first time in nearly one hundred years!  The first part of the book reprints his late 1907 to early 1908 \\"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\\" strips wherein the characters have surrealistic, bizarre, and darkly humorous dreams induced by a late night stack of Welsh Rarebit before bed.  Now I've never eaten rarebit before but I take it that this concoction of melted cheese, beer, hot sauce/pepper spread over toast was the early 20th century equivalent to a convenience store burrito.  Invariably the characters wake up swearing to never eat rarebit again.  While the joke itself wears thin after several pages, the delight is seeing what McCay does with his characters while they are in their dreams.  They turn into animals, are beset by tiny devils, see flying elephants, etc.  You'll notice the strips are signed \\"Silas\\".  Due to his contract, McCay could not sign them with his own name.<br /><br />By far the most interesting part of the book is the section that reprints many of McCay's editorial cartoons that he did while working for the New York Herald, New York Telegram, and New York American.  Unconfined by the panel format, these cartoons really show off his artistic talent and eye for fine line and detail illustration, not to mention the very edgy nature of the cartoons.  One shows Uncle Sam shoveling heaps of undesirable aliens into a barrel labeled \\"deportation\\".  Another piece with an anti-technology theme depicts a giant, mechanical dinosaur ravaging a city...all this some 70 years before Mecha Godzilla would appear on film!  Other editorial cartoons tackle subjects such as World War I and the anti-German sentiment, the plight of American Indians, crime, and poverty.  Subjects as topical today as they were back then.<br /><br />If you're unfamiliar with McCay, this collection of his early works from Checker Books is a great place to start.

Those two words seem to best describe the career of a man who rarely has gotten the accolades he deserves as one of the great artists of the last 25 years.  After reading the lengthy interview with him in this volume five of the Modern Masters series from TwoMorrows Publishing, certainly Jose's humble and quiet nature seems to be one of the reasons he is so underrated.  He's clearly a guy who isn't looking for the spotlight.  He hasn't tried to match the younger artists of the day by doing books filled with nothing but splash pages and poor anatomy.  He's just been content to be a dependent workhorse for DC comics.  While Jose may not have achieved the level of stardom that other artists have, you get the feeling that it really doesn't matter to him.  There's a lot of laughter throughout the interview and Jose seems very happy with his career.<br /><br />Jose was born in Spain but moved to Argentina with his family when he was very young.  He would get his America comic book start with Charlton on mainly romance titles.  Jose's many eclectic influences are certainly a factor behind his level of professionalism.  From old masters Alex Raymond and Hal Foster, to modern artists like Moebius and Ross Andru, and to great illustrators like Norman Rockwell, Jose relates just how each of these men as influenced his work through the years.<br /><br />Jose would start at DC in the late 1970's and worked on a variety of projects.  Jose did much of the art for DC's merchandising and marketing campaigns including their \\"Got Milk?\\" ad featuring Superman.  Jose was also the artist who worked on DC's first graphic novel Star Raiders.  Interviewer Eric Nolen-Weathington does a wonderful job covering Jose's very diverse career in comics, even getting into the mediums in which Jose likes to work in and his preferred types of tools which is invaluable advice for aspiring comic artists.  My personal favorite was the work he did on the Deadman limited series and kudos to TwoMorrows for reprinting some of the work inside this book.<br /><br />The interview runs through the first three-quarters of the book.  The last part is dedicated to a Jose Luis Garcia Lopez art gallery displaying numerous sketches, finished works, covers, and pages from throughout his distinguished career.  There's a fantastic drawing of Elvira, Mistress of the Dark sitting on Santa's lap, sketches and color guides from the Cinder & Ashe limited series and two brilliant illustrations, one featuring Wonder Woman and another with Superman and Lois Lane.<br /><br />Hats off to TwoMorrows Publishing for aiming the spotlight on this humble, under-appreciated talent!<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonadvice for aspiring comic artists.

As with the other volumes in the Gallery Girls series, Sal Quartuccio has assembled another extraordinary group of talented artists to give their renditions of the most mythical and beautiful creatures of the sea.<br /><br />The great Pelaez starts things out with a fantastic cover painting and follows this up with a number of terrific interior drawings, one featuring a gorgeous topless mermaid who looks like she's just been taken by surprise, and another showing a stern mermaid giving a spanking to a younger, naughtier one.<br /><br />Arantza is one of my favorite artists in the world and she also has several great pieces in this volume.  One depicts a hot, blonde bombshell, lying on a beach as a hermit crab idles by; another shows a mermaid cheerfully swimming amidst several nearby stingrays.<br /><br />Colucci, another favorite, delivers a dark, evil, vampiric Mermaid, surrounded by a school of razor-fanged piranha.  A terrifying and sad piece by Colucci shows a mermaid embracing the skeletal remains of another...perhaps a lover?<br /><br />The honor for the most erotic piece in the collection goes to Brian LeBlanc with an undersea orgy involving for mermaids and a captive woman.  A piece by Pedro Cuevas shows two spear gun-totting divers hunting a mermaid, or perhaps she is actually leading them to their doom.  Emiliano Urdinola has perhaps the most horrific illustration in the book as a mermaid is attacked by a bestial half-woman and half-Octopus like creature.<br /><br />Among the other artists featured in the book are Mitch Byrd, Tomas Giorello, Maraschi, Meriggi, Gracia, J.L. Roger, and Enric.  The book ends on a high note with a great back cover painting as three mermaids hide in a cave from a giant sea monster.  Thanks to the great pieces by Pelaez and Arantza, I enjoyed the second volume even more than the first.  I'd also like to point out that many of the original pieces in this collection can be purchased from the SQP website.  It's definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonke to point out that many of the original pieces in this collection can be purchased from the SQP website.

This series, which sparked controversy among long time fans of the Justice League, casts the moralistic league in a new, and rather dark light.  In many ways Identity Crisis serves to out do Marvel Comics at its own game of showing the frailty of superheroes, long their trademark.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, Sue Dibney, the wife of the Elongated Man has been murdered, and her body badly burned.  The Didney's home was outfitted with the most advanced security systems available and yet the killer got in and left without a single clue.  Even the combined abilities of Mister Miracle, The Atom, The Ray, The Metal Men, and Animal Man cannot find even the slightest trace of a clue.<br /><br />After the funeral, attended by most of the heroes of the DC universe, teams are formed to track down villains who use fire as a power and soon the Teen Titans, The Outsiders, The JSA, the old JLI, Booster Gold and Blue Beetle, and others are hot on the trail of the suspects.  But another group meets in secret...a group including Green Arrow, Hawkman, Black Canary, Zatanna, Atom, and the Elongated Man.  When The Flash sneaks in on the meeting he learns of a startling revelation.  Years earlier, in the League's satellite headquarters, Sue Dibney was alone stargazing when she was attacked and sexually assaulted by Doctor Light.  The maniacal Light then threatened the wives of the other members so this group, without the knowledge of Superman or Batman, had Zatanna perform a magical lobotomy on Doctor Light, but only after a divided vote among the members with The Flash (Barry Allen) providing the deciding vote.<br /><br />The Flash is outraged but reluctantly joins the group in their search for Light.  Meanwhile Jean Loring, the ex-wife of Ray Palmer (The Atom) is attacked and hung but survives.  Again no clues can be found.  Now all of the heroes with family are on edge.  Someone is targeting their loved ones.  Is it Doctor Light, or another villain?<br /><br />Identity Crisis presents a divided league and one were not uses to seeing.  Wally cannot believe that Barry Allen would have voted to mess with Light's mind.  What's interesting is how the members are more afraid of Batman finding out about what they did than Superman.  Some fans may look at this as tainting the reputation of the JLA but on the other hand this is not the 1960's anymore.  It's a harsh world we live in and writer Brad Meltzer has reflected this among the JLA members.<br /><br />The art by Rags Morales and Michael Bair is just gorgeous.  The battle with Deathstroke was among the most dynamic I've seen in years.  Bair has been a favorite of mine since his days on the Young All-Stars.  He's an extremely underrated talent.  The book features an introduction by Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon and also features commentary by Meltzer and Morales on specific scenes such as why Batman was not in attendance at Sues funeral, the seating arrangement of the heroes at the funeral, and the science involved in the battle with Deathstroke.  They also discuss the scene where Sue is sexually assaulted by Doctor Light and how the colors by Alex Sinclair show the cold tragedy of the scene.  This commentary truly helps the reader understand the story in greater depth.  Finally there's also a cover gallery of the various variant covers that were produced.<br /><br />Identity Crisis in many ways is an even more important series than the namesake Crisis on Infinite Earths from the 1980's.  While that series ultimately generated little change to the DC universe outside of the Death of Barry Allen, Identity Crisis is a story that could have lingering effects for years to come.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonthe heroes with family are on edge.

Gennadiy Koufay is a relative newcomer to the realm of pin-up/erotic art but in a short time the native of the Ukraine has quickly established himself as one of the best in the filed.  SQP presents the first collection of work from this talented artist who came to New York in 1995.  Looking at Koufay's work it's obvious that he's influenced or at least studied the pin-up art of the 1940's.  Like those great masters, Koufay focuses the entire attention of his painting on his subjects, leaving the backgrounds completely open.<br /><br />Some of the subjects of this collection include blonde bombshells Pam Anderson and Victoria Silverstedt as well as the legendary Bettie Page.  Anderson takes the spotlight in a painting simply titled, \\"Pamela\\" as she models on a bed in a white teddy.  Pam also appears on the back cover in a piece called \\"Apple\\", as a topless Pam is wrapped up in the American Flag, eating an apple as the ultimate female temptress.<br /><br />Bettie Page is the subject of a number of pieces in the book.  My favorite has her dressed in a lavender Playboy bunny outfit.  The Gorgeous Silverstedt also is the subject of several of Koufay's paintings.  \\"Village Girl\\" shows off her ample assets while she is wearing lace panties and a cowboy hat.  Another dazzling piece has Silverstedt posing in a revealing blue sun dress, holding a daisy.  Note the brilliant blue eyes!<br /><br />A classic 1940's style pinup gets a two page, centerfold type spread as an alluring nude woman lies on her stomach with her backside arched in the air.  A piece called Pinup #44 is yet another of Koufay's takes on classic pin-up art with an alluring red head dressed in sheer black nylons and lace bra.<br /><br />What strikes you about Koufay's art is that he really \\"gets\\" the look of classic pinup art while still adding his own seductive style to each piece.  I look forward to seeing more from him in the future.  The book is 48 pages featuring both black & white and full color art.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonart. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Tim Janson <br />	2005-09-23

I hope the film does huge business so creator Joss Whedon can rub their noses in it.<br /><br />Like all the great Visual Companion books it contains a wealth of information about the film including some great photography, pre-productions sketchs, finished art, storyboards, as well as the complete shooting script.  There are great concept drawings of ships and weapons as well.  But the best part of the book is the lengthy interview with Whedon himself which reveals a lot of information about the Firefly universe.  Great stuff and a must have for fans.	2005-09-23

Written by Phil Hester with glorious black & white art by Mike Huddleston, \\"Deep Sleeper\\" is a Lovecraftian Dream Cycle-style tale of man's existence and what lies beyond existence.  Cole Gibson is haunted by strange dreams and has been for years.  He's a struggling writer, trying to make ends meet for his family while his wife pressures him to find a more stable way of earning a living.<br /><br />Encountering a spiritualist, Yogi-like monk named Ramman, shows Cole that he can leave his body and explore another world in his dreams.  But Ramman's motives are hardly benevolent.  Ramman has existed for centuries, harvesting souls to use as fuel for a monstrous device that will allow him to penetrate the barrier of existence and become a God.  But he needs to harness Cole's power for the device and eventually forces his hands by allowing one of his servants to steal Cole's body while he is out of it.  He threatens Cole's family unless he agrees to help.  Aiding Ramman in his plot is The Dervish, a demonic entity who is the very aspect of pure violence and hate who seeks to kill all life.<br /><br />Cole is also threatened by Jailer Monks who use their bodies to imprison demons and tap into their power.  They oppose Ramman and do not intend to let Cole help him in his plot to attain divinity.  The dream world is filled with a multitude of other perils including the monstrously tentacled Harvesters, and the Vacants who are souls who've lost their own bodies and seek to steal the bodies of other travelers.  Cole must now figure out just why the forces of good and evil are fighting over him.  What power does he possess and can he harness it in time to save his family and all existence?<br /><br />\\"Deep Sleeper\\" works on many levels: a drama, a horror, and a look at man's existence and how everything is real and everything has meaning, no matter how little it may seem.  While Cole ventures into this strange, dreamscape world, at the core is still an everyday guy facing the same problems that we all face, day in and day out.  The central theme seems to be to appreciate life in all its forms and with all its many quirks.  Huddleston's eclectic art, with his ingenious use of zip-a-tone and surrealism, set a dark, moody tone to the story and made this one a fast page-turner.  The book comes with sketch and cover galleries as additional bonus features.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim JansonWhile Cole ventures into this strange, dreamscape world, at the core is still an everyday guy facing the same problems that we all face, day in and day out.

You'll certainly find all of that in more in this compilation trade paperback from Soft Skull Press.  The 150 page book features an eclectic array of comic strips that run the gamut from very rough, to professionally polished (although they may be reluctant to admit to it).  What's evident in reading the book is the passion that the artists and writers have for the subject matter.<br /><br />\\"Doll Face\\" by Stephen Winter and Robert Kirby is a bittersweet tale of love, found and then lost, by a gay black man who describes himself as \\"old\\".  We see his excursion through the gay community and feel his pain but rejoice in his eventually maturation process.<br /><br />\\"Italian Cousin\\" is a rather twisted tale by Serena Pillai.  Chris' 15 year old cousin from Italy comes to stay with he and his wife, and spends the entire time trying to seduce the middle-aged Chris.  \\"Teddy Bear's Wedding\\" is a delightfully screwball tale of gay marriage long before states were allowing it and before the heated debate.  Two, middle-aged, overweight men plan a wedding in the park and use just about every homosexual clich&eacute; in this wacky, and wonderfully illustrated story by Robert Tripton.<br /><br />\\"Look! Look!\\"  is a different take on old grammar school reading primers as it tells the story of two lesbians as Delta just gets out of jail and goes out on the town with Peanut.  A trip to a bar turns into a brawl as the pair teach a couple of overzealous men a lesson they will never forget with lines like \\"See Delta Kick Ass!\\" and \\"Hear Peanut Crunch Heads.\\"  This story features the best art in the entire book, shot directly from G.B. Jones' pencils with words by Jennifer Camper.<br /><br />Other talents in the book include Ariel Schrag, Leanne Franson, and a wonderful cartoon jam by Camper, Howard Cruse, Diane DiMassa, Rupert Kinnard, Alison Bechdel, and Ivan Velez, Jr.  This book shows off the true essence of underground/alternative comix.pert Kinnard, Alison Bechdel, and Ivan Velez, Jr.  This book shows off the true essence of underground/alternative comix. <br />	2005-09-20

Instead I'll use brilliant to describe the art of Fastner & Larson, still going strong after more than 25 years.  It's hard to nail down just what it is about the pair that I like so much...I think it's the humor they inject, often uproarious, and often quite subtly into their work.<br /><br />Kiss of Death is a collection of much of the duo's earlier works from the 1980's and early 1990's.  It collects some magnificent pieces from many of their portfolios over the years such as \\"Daughters of the Disk\\" from 1988.  You'll get a rare glimpse at a solo portfolio by Rich Larson called \\"Angels of Death\\" and it's interesting to see Larson's gorgeous pencils and inks without Fastner's trademark airbrush.  \\"Petz\\" is a portfolio featuring sexy warrior women and their beasties, \\"Clan of the Claw\\" is a prehistoric set with scantily clad cave women battling Dinosaurs.<br /><br />In the \\"Seven of Swords\\" portfolio, a fantastic collection of Swordswomen, SQ productions gives us a chance to see the illustrations take shape from rough, preliminary sketches, to the final, completed piece, and all the steps in between, less you think it just came easy to these guys.<br /><br />While the bulk of the book is in (glorious) black & white, there is a color section in the middle including a dazzling, 1950's-style \\"B\\" movie alien menace painting with a woman running for her life from a blob-like creature.  A holiday painting features a lovely swordswoman in Santa Miniskirt, hugging the literal North Pole, while razor-fanged reindeer battle to the death with pirate elves.<br /><br />For you spanking fans there are the usual giddily humorous corporal punishment pieces that the pair is so well known (and worshipped) for.  One interesting thing I learned about from Kiss of Death is that SQP took over the art direction for Fleetway Comcis/Quality Comics.  This led to Rich doing a number of covers for the hugely popular British Scf-Fi character, Judge Dredd.  Many of these unbelievable covers are reprinted in this collection.<br /><br />Kiss of Death is a different collection than the more recent Little Black Book and other Fastner & Larson collections from SQP.  It's more straight-up Sci-Fi and Fantasy than the more recent books which are more pin-up oriented.  It's a great collection for their legions of fans who may be unfamiliar with their older work.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonpopular British Scf-Fi character, Judge Dredd.

As a fan of 30's and 40's detective, adventure, and spicy pulps, the art of Fastner and Larson has always had a special appeal to me.  No modern artists have managed to capture that devious and sexy pulp look like these guys have been able to do now for some thirty years.  This is the second of their \\"Little Black Book\\" collections that feature a sampling of their work both new and old as well as a nine page story.<br /><br />Included are several pieces that are inspired by, and are a tribute to the legendary Weird Tales artist Margaret Brundage.  One of these is entitled \\"Last Kiss\\" depicting a typical Brundage-style damsel dressed in a whispy pink silk, kissing a demon.  In \\"Shadow Creeps\\" a woman recoils in horror from a shadowy hand as the threatening fiend is just out of view.<br /><br />\\"To the Rescue\\" is a classic, pulp-inspired piece with a mad doctor about to inject a woman with a needle as the hero crashes through the window, flying with the aid of a rocket pack.  In \\"Devil take Wing\\" a great, bat-winged demon flies off with his captive female while a mob of angry villagers tries in vain to saver her.  \\"Ticklish\\" finds a gorgeous blonde in a negligee, tightly bound while another female playfully tortures her by tickling her backside with a feather.  This is a wonderfully humorous piece and so typical of their work.<br /><br />More great pulp-art items include the fantastic back cover with the ubiquitous Oriental, yellow-menace fiend preparing to torture his beautiful captive.  \\"The Devil Wore Evening Clothes\\" is a magnificently rendered, classic Shadow painting.  In addition to these pieces, the book also features a sampling of their comic book related work.  The Thing Battles Doctor Doom high atop the Baxter Building, Captain Marvel fights the evil demi-god Thanos, and Iron Man battles a classic beast from the early 1960's, Fin Fang Foom.<br /><br />The book also shows off a lot of their older work from the late 1970's and early 1980's and you can see how the pair's work has evolved over the years to the near perfection they reached today.  As mentioned, the book also contains a 9 page, full color strip called \\"Cursed Kiss\\", a saucy tale of 1920's Egypt.

Imagine my delight when I saw that the wonderful people at Arcadia Publishing have put out a book on both of my home towns.  I would hazard to guess that most people are fairly unaware of their own town's history.  Like me you may be fascinated to learn that the history is much more colorful than you ever dreamed.  Take Livonia, for example.  It's one of the largest cities in Michigan with a population of over 100,000 people.  But I didn't know that Livonia was officially formed in 1835...two years before Michigan even became a state!  And the name Livonia?  It was derived from a former Eastern European nation of the same name.<br /><br />Livonia is home to the oldest cemetery in the state, the Newburgh cemetery, practically in walking distance from my house.  While it may not be able to compete with the ancient cemeteries of New England, Newburgh Cemetery does boast the final resting place of a handful of Revolutionary War veterans.<br /><br />As with all their books, Livonia is bolstered by stunning archival photography which includes photos of some of the city's earliest settlers including Hannah Macomber who came to the area in 1826 and died in 1894.  In addition to the photos, there are some wonderful vintage drawings and maps of the area that are reprinted in the book.  Growing up, I was a frequent visitor to the Alfred Noble Library.  But I never knew that Noble was a distinguished Civil War Vet and civil engineer who helped build the Panama Canal.<br /><br />Long time Livonia residents will delight in looking at these great photos, such as the one showing homes being built in Rosedale Gardens, Livonia's oldest subdivision, and yet today, one of the most beautiful and well-maintained areas of Colonials, Bungalows, and Federal-styled homes anywhere.<br /><br />A landmark and sure sign of fall is driving by Roperti's Turkey farm on Five Mile rd.  The farm was established in 1948.  There are some great Photographs of the soon-to-be-demolished Wonderland Mall, which began as an outdoor mall, and was finally enclosed in the mid-1980's.  Other great Livonia landmarks that you'll read about are Bates Hamburgers, the Mai Kai and Terrace Theatres, The Fisher Body Plant, and the Detroit Race Course, demolished in 1999 to make way for a Home Depot and Meijers store...ahh...Progress.

One of the best ways to learn about the history of a region is to visit these ancient graveyards.  \\"Stones & Bones of New England\\" takes the reader on a wonderful tour of dozens of cemeteries located in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.  Each section has a state map showing the general location of the cemetery.  More importantly, each cemetery that author Lisa Rogak covers comes with an address (or at least an exact location), phone number if applicable, and hours of operation.  I've read a number of books on old cemeteries and this information is often not included.<br /><br />Throughout this tour you'll visit cemeteries that are the final resting place of many famous Americans, some infamous Americans, along with suspected witches, not too mention than many of the sites are haunted.<br /><br />In Connecticut, the Mountain Grove Cemetery is where you'll find the great showman P.T. Barnum buried.  But even his 25' tall monument isn't the largest...that honor goes to one of Barnum's most famous attractions, the two foot tall Tomb Thumb who has a 40' obelisk.  The Bara Hack Cemetery is not only a haunted cemetery, but is also located in a genuine, deserted ghost town.<br /><br />Maine features the Brooklin Cemetery where children's author E.B. White is buried.  The Old Burying Ground in York features the frequently visited gravef Mary Nasson, suspected of being a witch.  A large stone slab covers the ground where she is buried, supposedly to prevent her escape.<br /><br />As one might suspect, Massachusetts has some of the nation's oldest cemeteries and gravestones.  The Sleepy Hollow Cemetery is home to some of America's literary giants including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Louisa May Alcott.  Oak Grove in Fall River is where you will find the grave of the infamous Lizzie Borden, who died in 1927.  Many of the settlers who came over on the Mayflower are buried in Burial Hill in Plymouth.  Burying Point in Salem is where the presiding judge in the Salem witch trials, Judge Hathorne, lies in his eternal sleep.<br /><br />Rhode Island's Chestnuthill Baptist Church Cemetery features the grave of a suspected vampire.  Mercy Brown had been the third member of the family to die within a short period of time.  The two others were exhumed and found to be decomposing, but when Mercy was dug up, she was still perfectly preserved.  Her family then removed her heart, burned it, and re-buried her.  The Old Burying Ground in Little Compton contains the grave of Elisabeth Pabodie, the daughter of John and Priscilla Alden, and the first white female born in New England.  Perhaps New England's most favorite resident, certainly to horror fans, H.P. Lovecraft, is buried in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence.<br /><br />On the lighter side, if you go to Vermont, be sure to visit Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard, where the famous ice cream makers have erected tombstones to all of their discontinued flavors with some very humorous epitaphs.<br /><br />If there is one minor complaint it is that there are, at most, just one photograph to accompany each cemetery listing and some do not have any.  More photos would have been greatly appreciated.  Still, it's a fantastic book for those who appreciate the history and lore of old cemeteries.  You literally find yourself stepping back into history as you visit the graves of famous Americans who fought in the Revolutionary War like Ethan Allen.  The book also has an excellent resource section for further study.  A great book!<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonhe settlers who came over on the Mayflower are buried in Burial Hill in Plymouth.

The groups founder Roger Baldwin had friends and family members who were members of the communist party.  The ACLU has used its influence for decades to intimidate honest, hard-working Americans and to go against the majority of opinion.  Their predeliction to go after people and groups with out the financial means to fight back is legendary.<br /><br />The ACLU rather than defend the constitution has done everything in its power to destroy the constitution.  Witness the Minuteman project where hundreds of volunteers were going to patrol our border with Mexico and to contact the immigration border patrol when they saw illegals crossing the border into the U.S.  The head of the ACLU in Arizona threatened these volunteers with civil suits even though the groups leader said they would make no move to stop the illegals themselves, but merely to report them and follow them at a distance.<br /><br />The fact is that the ACLU is trying to attack the way of life for honest Americans while protecting scumbag child molesters and other deviants by opposing programs were sex offenders are forced to register with their local police if they move.  Their attacks on religions are particularly disturbing.  They actually sued to require Freshmen at the University of North Carolina to read a book with excerpts from the Koran.  I urge all Americans to read this book and take whatever action they can.	2005-09-15

In a relative short time Brian Rood has accelerated himself near the top of the pack when it comes to fantasy/erotic illustrators.  Just approaching his 30th birthday, Rood has already built up an impressive list of credits including work in comics, feature films, collectible card games, magazines, and more.  This is his first collection of art from the great people at SQP, simply the best publishers of fantasy and erotic/pin-up art in the business.  This 48 page book presents an eclectic collection of Rood's pin-up and fantasy art featuring everyone from Bettie page to Lady Death.<br /><br />What I love about Rood's pinup art is the soft, warm tones of his art.  The result is a very photo-realistic look. A perfect example is the piece entitled simply \\"The Bombshell\\" depicting a hot blonde in a leather corset and lace stockings.  The other quality I love about Rood's work, almost in contrast to the first, is the shine and glare effects he achieves while still working in softer colors.  An example of this can be found in \\"Pink Caddy\\" as model Stacy Walker is decked out in leather boots and a metallic bikini while a freshly waxed and shining pink Cadillac is in the back ground.<br /><br />Rood also takes a turn at the women of Chaos Comics with several Lady Death and Purgatori pieces in the book.  \\"Purgatori Trick or Treat\\" features the sexy demon dressed in a Catholic school girl outfit, holding a pumpkin candy collecting basket.  Lady Death is pictured with another one of Brian's favorite subjects, James O'Barr's The Crow.<br /><br />You'll find more than just beautiful women in the book though.  Rood also includes some samples of his superhero work as well as a magnificent rendering of the late guitar God Jimi Henrdrix in a painting called \\"Voodoo Child\\".  It's quite a outstanding first collection by Rood and produced with the same outstanding care that SQP does on all of their books.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson	2005-09-14

Wally West has been granted a boon by the Spectre to have knowledge of his true identity totally erased from the world...and not only from the average man on the street, but EVERYONE, including the JLA.  This was as a result of the events of Identity Crisis where someone (can't give that away) was targeting and murdering the family members of several superheroes including Sue Dibney, the wife of The Elongated Man.<br /><br />As the story opens, Wally's wife Linda has left him to have some time for herself to think about the recent events as the wife of a hero.  Meanwhile the Flash has no time to rest as a parade in his honor is interrupted by several members of his rogue's gallery.  Now one thing I always loved about the Flash was his colorful and somewhat eccentric lineup of villains.  Only Batman can boast a more bizarre group of villains.  Plunder, Trickster II, Tarpit, and Abra Kadabra bust up the parade festivities and have Wally helpless until help arrive in the form of Kid Flash and Jay Garrick, the Golden Age Flash.<br /><br />Wally eventually goes before the JLA to find out just what happened to their memories of Barry Allen, and who is wearing the mask of the Flash now.  Wally walks out on the league, leading to one of those great Superman/Flash races in shades of the Silver Age as Superman demands to know the truth and what the Flash is running from.  Secrets are revealed on many levels as Wally soon learns (again apparently) what the JLA began doing to villains such as Dr. Light, essentially using Zatanna's magic to lobotomize them.  They took it one step further with The Top, altering his mind to try and turn him good.  It works for awhile but soon drives the Top insane.  This leads to a climactic battle between The Top, Flash, and Zatanna.<br /><br />Wally once again must come to grips with what the league did.  If you read Identity Crisis you know that Wally was the most outspoken about what some of the JLAers did and how it was kept a secret from other members, specifically Superman and Batman.  Geoff Johns delivers a multi-layered plot that works with and expands on the story from Identity Crisis.  On top of all this, Flash's Rogues Gallery is dealing with the death of Captain Boomerang and the revelation that he had a son who has now taken up his father's mantle.  Add to this that some former members of the Rogues (Pied Piper, Trickster I, and Heatwave) are now working for the FBI and going after their former associates and another subplot involving Zoom and there is a lot packed into this one story.  If there is a weakness it's perhaps that Johns is guilty of throwing too much at readers and there are loose ends left unresolved at the books conclusion.  That said, it's a strong story and shows how Wally has truly matured (It has been some 20 years since he took over as The Flash).  The art of Howard Porter and Livesay is first-rate without trying to be over-powering to the story.  A cover gallery featuring the brilliant work of Michael Turner is included.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim JansonZatanna. <br /> <br />Wally once again must come to grips with what the league did.

The book presents mainly tame Halloween d&eacute;cor and on that level it works very well.  You just have to know what you're getting.  Author Cindy Fuller wastes no time with lengthy histories of Halloween myths and traditions...we've all read those time and time again.  She jumps right into the many projects found in this 96 page book.<br /><br />One of the semi-scary projects to be found is the Floating Phantom, made with just a handful of items that you may have at home or can be picked up at the local craft store.  Made from primarily a piece of old white bed sheet (I prefer an off white or gray to make it seem no so \\"pure\\") and some line for hanging, you can achieve more of a terrifying look by drawing a more evil face on your phantom before hanging from a tree or perhaps an awning.<br /><br />Halloween wreaths are becoming quite common place today and allow a decorator to really use their own imagination in coming up with unique designs.  There's a wonderful Halloween wreath, decorated with tiny ghosts that serves a dual function.  It not only looks good, but you can stick suckers all around the wreath for a distinctive way of passing out candy to trick-or-treaters.<br /><br />A very simple, yet effective way to make scary d&eacute;cor for Halloween is to cut various shapes of ghosts, or bats, or other traditional Halloween characters out of Acetate and stick them to your windows, using light to create some very spooky silhouettes.<br /><br />Fuller also has many projects for d&eacute;cor inside the home including a neat little pumpkin patch village that can go on top of your mantle or on a table.  There are also a number of items that can be made out of pine if you have the right tools to cut the wood.  The book contains patterns for all of these wood projects.<br /><br />There are also things like recipes and d&eacute;cor for Halloween parties.  The book features a full color photograph of each completed project and each is detailed in clear, concise instructions, and is accompanied by a full materials list.  While it's more crafty than scary, \\"Haunt Your House for Halloween\\" presents some great-looking and simple projects to accent your home's holiday look.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tm Jansoneatures a full color photograph of each completed project and each is detailed in clear, concise instructions, and is accompanied by a full materials list.

No, this is a fond look at Christmas traditions around the country produced by the editors of Victoria Magazine.  It's a look at families gathered by the hearth, snow covered churches, and dazzling Christmas displays, all which makes one wax poetically about that perfect Christmas that we all strive for.  Featuring brilliant full-color photography and accompanied by thoughts or verses by notable writers, \\"The Traditions of Christmas\\" is a wonderful complement to that favorite time of the year.<br /><br />Visit the historical churches of Connecticut, elegantly decorated in traditional green wreaths and red bows as the sights, smells, and sounds of the holiday season are described majestically.  Head from the country to the city to gaze in awe at the lavish window displays in the Lord & Taylor store in New York City.  This particular display recreates the Washington Irving's view of Tarrytown in the early 1800's.<br /><br />The ambience of a New England Christmas is captured in all its glory at the Vermont home of beloved children's book Illustrator Tasha Tudor.  Tudor and her family gather to celebrate the season in grand old style with homemade gifts, stories, and Christmas Carols.  From Vermont you head east to the Great Lake State and the famous Victorian Inn of Union City Michigan.  There you will partake in a true Victorian holiday feast in their restored, period dining room, consisting of cheddar soup, roast goose, chestnut stuffing, and rum butter plum pudding.<br /><br />The book also features a number of authentic Victorian recipes.  If a visit to all of these wonderful places (and more), doesn't get you into the mood for a white Christmas then nothing will!  Beautiful color photography adorns the 144 pages.  It's 85 degrees outside right now, but I'm ready for Christmas!<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson	2005-09-13

While I didn't start reading comics until the early part of the bronze age of the early 1970's, the Silver Age is still my favorite comic era.  I was fortunate to have a couple of stores that sold old back issues and was able to put together a nice collection of Silver Age comics.  This book is a tribute to many of the artists who help make the Silver Age so revolutionary in it's artistic style and approach to story telling.  The political unrest and turbulence brought about a big change in our country and comic books as well.  The cynicism of the era is reflected in the art of most of the men who helped drive this revolution forward as they tackled stories dealing with drugs, Viet Nam, civil rights, women's rights, and more.<br /><br />The book details these great artists by reprinting many of their most famous covers or pages with the artistss comments placed into the context of the word balloons or panel text which I found kind of cool.  Others didn't seem to care for this method citing it made the book difficult to follow but I disagree.<br /><br />Carmine Infantino, one of DC's stalwarts was charge with the task of saving Batman.  Infantino was given the task of getting Batman out of it's 1950's doldrums or risk the title being canceled.  Hard to believe today that Batman was once on the chopping block.  Infantino would re-design the character's look, giving it the yellow oval around the bat insignia and changing the ears and nose of the costume.  Many of Infantino's great covers are on display including the re-introduction of the Riddler and the first appearance of Poison Ivy.<br /><br />I was never a big Steve Ditko fan but I respect his contributions.  As noted, Ditko always went for a more realistic approach to his character's look as opposed to the larger than life heroes of Jack Kirby.  Speaking of Kirby, he gets the largest section in the book and rightfully so.  You really have to look back at his mid-60's work to see just how good he was.  Kirby shares his thoughts on the different motivations for Doctor Doom's becoming a villain which seem to have differed over the years.  Jack notes that the Hulk was roughly based on Frankenstein.  Kirby's work in the 1960's was majestic.  While most will point out the Fantastic Four as being his best work I personally love his Thor stories, especially those epics with Galactus, Ego, Mangog, and the Destroyer.<br /><br />Steranko has always intrigued me.  Never has an artist with such a relatively small body of comic work been more discussed than the mercurial and rather egotistical Jim Steranko.  Steranko was the Andy Warhol of comics, infusing his art with a psychedelic, pop-art feel and using techniques that had never been seen in comics.  His cover work is what I recall most, especially on Nick Fury, a minor character that Steranko was allowed to go wild on.<br /><br />Neal Adams is perhaps my all-time favorite artist.  While most of my comic collection has long since been sold off, I still have my Adams issues that I will pickup and read every now and then.  The X-Men battle with the Sentinels, the Kree-Skrull war in the Avengers and many others.  Adams is a bit of an egomaniac but deservedly so.  No artist before him brought the kind of realism and power to their art than he did.<br /><br />Other artists featured include Gil Kane, Joe Kubert, and Gene Colan.  In the back there is a \\"More Masters\\" section with quick spotlights on Wally Wood, John Buscema, Nick Cardy, Murphy Anderson, and Curt Swan. Anderson and Buscema get short-changed a bit.  These two important talents should have received a full look at their work.  There's also a few notable exclusions including John Romita, who is every bit as important as Ditko, and Marie Severin.

In all there are seven chapters in the book covering the following topics:<br /><br />1. Running the Game<br /><br />2. Adventures<br /><br />3. The Campaign<br /><br />4. The Saltmarsh<br /><br />5. NPC's<br /><br />6. Characters<br /><br />7. Magic Items<br /><br />Running the game provides tips on knowing your players...their behaviors, their personalities and tendencies.  Examples are given on how to add drama and developing a story in your games.  Suggestions are provided for using house rules and laptops to assist the DM.  While this information is nice, it's more geared towards inexperienced DMs.<br /><br />The adventure chapter covers things such as many new traps, map and grid design, building encounter tables, and encounters for such areas as the Abyss and Infernal planes, graveyards, haunted buildings, lost ruins, and several other specific type locations.<br /><br />The campaign section provides information if you want to develop your own campaign as opposed to buying an off the shelf product such as the Forgotten Realms.  It provides all the information you need on setting up a medieval-type world including social and political structures, lifestyles and more.  There are also 50 rumors/adventure hooks provided that the DM can use to flesh out adventures.<br /><br />The Saltmarsh is recognizable to older fans of D&D as the name of an old module.  The Saltmarsh is provided here as a kind of drop-in city for use in any campaign.  It's ready made with all the information you need to run if you don't feel like making a city from scratch, providing maps, business locations, NPCs, guilds, adventure hooks and more.  It's one of the best sections in the book.<br /><br />The chapters on NPCs and characters are ok.  The NPC section is short and fairly forgettable but the character section features information on designing prestige classes which is very well done.  There's also info on working with other players as a team when attacking and combining spells for maximum effect.<br /><br />The last chapter is on Magic Items and goes into customizing items with signature abilities or items that are bonded to their creator.  A new type of magic item, sort of, are magic locations.  These are ancient, and very powerful sights that can be found within a world which can imbue a character with certain abilities for up to one year.  For example the Heart of Fire is a location that can imbue a spellcaster with magic that increases his casting level by +1 for one year when casting fire-based spells.  There are a bunch of these locations as well as tons of new magic rings, rods, armor, weapons, and miscellaneous items.<br /><br />The Dungeon Master II guide is kind of like the whipped cream and cherry on a sundae.  It's not necessary and you can certainly live without it, but it does add a little flavor and certainly makes it more filling.  Take what you want out of the book.  I personally like the section on designing prestige classes and the inclusion of Saltmarsh is a great aid to the DM.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonesigning prestige classes which is very well done.

The Fury of Shadow box set continues to keep the bar set very high as this supplement moves the battle for the world of Aryth into Erethor, the homeland of the elves.  The first three chapters of the guidebook details the various Elven lands and how the evil of the Dark Lord Izrador has already affected the lands.  Major points of interest are including in the descriptions of each land and also serve as adventure hooks for the GM.  Areas such as the Spider Haunted Thorn Webs of Tanglehorn, The Darkening Wood, and the massive, steel tree known as Silverthorn all make wonderful jumping off points for the GM to begin an adventure.  And then there is the ominous Obsidian Spire that churns with foul magic and evil creatures.<br /><br />Succeeding chapters detail the free Elven peoples and their struggles against the dark forces as well as documenting the history of the war within Erethor and the forces that the Dark Lord has brought to bear against the Elves.  This is where the Midnight products really shine.  There is a depth and richness to the history and people of the Midnight setting is lacking in many campaigns.  You can tell that the designers spent a great deal of time developing the milieu rather than just cookie cutter places and names.  Rather than do all the work for you, Fury of the Shadow outlines several adventures that the GM can then flesh out and develop further.  These outlines also include encounters to help the GM out.<br /><br />The final chapters provide a wealth of resource material including the new monsters you'll encounter such as Bog Hags, as well as major NPCs, new feats, and new prestige classes.  The boxed set comes with a beautifully illustrated poster sized map, a regional map book, a GM screen, and character record sheets.  I would concur with some of the other reviewers that at $50, it may be a bit on the pricey side but you can get it for about 33% off at Amazon which definitely makes it worth the money.  As with all their Midnight products, Fantasy Flight Games spares no expense in the production.  The cover art to the box and books are first rate as is the interior art.  It's perhaps a small thing, but one that sets them apart from other companies producing RPGs.  These really catch your eye when you see them.  It's for this reason that Midnight has moved to the top of my list of favorite campaign worlds.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonould concur with some of the other reviewers that at $50, it may be a bit on the pricey side but you can get it for about 33% off at Amazon which definitely makes it worth the money.

Call it AD&D with a big bold sense of humor and lots of murder and mayhem.  Hackmaster is the game and you're not going anywhere without this Hackmaster Game Master's Guide.  Hackmaster is a truly brilliant game from Kenzer & Co., and something that veteran (I hesitate to say old) AD&D gamers like myself will love.  Hackmaster freely and with permission uses the original AD&D rules (hence the remarkably similar covers) to those original Ad&D books of the late 70's and early 80's but imbues it with a sly sense of humor and an in your face attitude to provide the kind of gaming experience that you used to love before TSR and now Wizards of the Coast went nuts and started putting out a gazillion supplements.<br /><br />Veterans (there's that word again) will recognize much of the material contained in side this massive book but you'll still have to pay attention because the designers have added their special little nuances throughout to make this one hilarious but still straight-forward, RPG experience.  Everything you'd expect to be covered is, including character creation, class, race, etc, but these guys have added their own little touches such as character quirks and flaws that add new depth to those two-dimensional character.  These quirks take form in things like male pattern baldness, lips, and nosebleeds.  Some could even aid your character.  Turning to combat, Hackmaster has, hands down, the largest critical hit table that I have ever seen, even including an anatomical drawing to help show where the damage is done.<br /><br />Hackmaster provides a tool that is overdue by some 25 years...a Smartass Smackdown table.  This table is used for dealing with out of control players.  Roll a D100 and see the results.  Perhaps that whiner develops a twitch, perhaps that ruthless killer of NPC's is infected by a skin-eating bacteria, maybe the dawdler slowing down the game finds himself the object of unnatural love from a powerful NPC (I'll let you define unnatural)  It's touches like this that make the book a scream.  Want another nice tool?  How about a random tavern name generator?  Now that really works!<br /><br />The magic item selection contains all those great items you remember from the original DM guide although some of the names have been changed to protect...someone.  Thus we have the Hand of Vectra, along with the companion Eye, and, new to this book, the Feet of the Lich Vectra.  There's also the Ring of Mercy Killing (AKA the Ring of Kavorkian), the Rod of Gender Bending, and the Bolt of the Month Pouch.  If I am making this sound like a parody it's really not.  At it's core Hackmaster is good, old time AD&D hack & slash fun.  The designers have simply taken what is a great game and added a little humor that was probably already there to begin with in your own campaign.  And, Hackmaster also has the largest random encounter tables I have ever seen, requiring the roll of a D10,000 to find out what you run into.  What a superb book and what a great tribute to a simpler time of RPG gaming.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim JansonIt's touches like this that make the book a scream.  Want another nice tool?

It would have been great for this to be included all in the original campaign but such is life in RPGs.  This supplement specifically covers what has become known as the five nations.  A detailed history explains how these were once united into one kingdom with a tradition of choosing a new successor to the throne.  But when five rulers chose to ignore the rules of succession a hundred years war erupted, tearing the lands apart into the five distinct kingdoms of Aundair, Breland, Mournland, Karrnath, and Thrane.<br /><br />Each of these five lands are covered in the book with a detailed map, information about it's people, notable places, groups, and social structure.  There are also adventure hooks provided for each region that the enterprising DM can use to build scenarios from.  For example in Aundair players can traverse the Crying Fields which, during full moons, becomes haunted with undead.  Encounter tables are provided as the players can run into some of the most dreaded forms of undead including wraiths, specters, vampires, shadows, even liches.<br /><br />The book provides several new prestige classes like the Knight Phantom, Dark Lantern, and Cyran Avenger.  The Knight Phantoms are wizard knights that are similar to the Eldtritch Knights found in the DM's guide.  They are known for riding upon phantom steeds.  The Dark Lanterns are the spies and assassins for the crown of Breland.  They have a unique blend of fighting, stealth, and diplomacy skills, perfectly suited for missions of espionage.  They gain the slippery mind skill which allows them an extra save to escape from charm/mind control spells.  The Cyran Avenger is kind of an Avenging Ranger class whose combat proficiencies are combined with hunting and tracking skills.  The Cyran Avenger gains a benefit called an Avenging Strike that can be performed on any creature that has harmed an ally of the Cyran Avenger.  This strike provides extra damage to the attack.<br /><br />There are also the ubiquitous new monsters and such.  Like most WOC it has top production values; the art is uniformly good throughout and book the book is bound very well.  The information is maybe a bit superfluous however.  It provides added depth but it's not required reading.  Eberron definitely has a different feel than The Forgotten Realms though and if you're looking for a different campaign than Forgotten Realms, then Eberron is a good choice.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim JansonThe Cyran Avenger gains a benefit called an Avenging Strike that can be performed on any creature that has harmed an ally of the Cyran Avenger.

They were two of my favorites when I began reading comics in the mid-1970's.  I was fortunate to have two stores close to me that sold old back issues of comic books.  I was able to put together quite a collection of silver age comics.  Among my favorite comics was Gene's run on the original Doctor Strange series beginning with #169.  These atmospheric, psychedelic stories were unlike anything I had ever seen.  I had sold my collection in the 1980's but recently picked up that complete run all over again because I was still enchanted by the great Colan work on those books.<br /><br />Secrets in the Shadows is a combination biography and tribute to one of the all-time great comic artists, Gene Colan.  Author Tom Field takes on a guided tour through Gene's life, beginning with his upbringing in New York and his first comic book work for Fiction House.  Gene tells a story similar to many of his contemporaries such as John Buscema and John Romita, and their mass dismissal from Timely Comics.  Gene would go on to DC and then back to what was now Atlas Comics.  Atlas would then implode leaving Gene again out of work in the late 1950's and with a lifelong feeling of insecurity about the comic book business.  As Gene explains this was a difficult time in his life as he was not only out of a job, but also had just gone through a divorce with his first wife.<br /><br />Stan Lee would come beckoning again in the early 1960's as the Marvel Age was off and running.  Gene quickly became one of Marvel's top artists and perhaps the only one whose style was so unique that he was not asked to pencil over Jack Kirby's layouts the way many other artists were.  Field presents several conversations in the book between Gene and some of the people he worked with at Marvel.  The first is a lengthy conversation from 2004 between Gene and Stan Lee.  They talk about their first meeting at Timely in the 1940's.  Gene mentions that Stan was wearing a beanie cap with a propeller...now that's something I'd love to see!  They also discuss their creative process and how books were plotted and finished.  Other conversations include Gene talking with his long-time inker Tom Palmer with whom he worked on so many great books over the years, and with Steve Gerber, the writer on Howard the Duck.<br /><br />Gene worked on numerous titles at Marvel over the years, Daredevil, The Avengers, Captain America...But perhaps the title most associated with him was Dracula which had a remarkable 70 issue run in the 1970's.  Colan's Dracula was dark and grim and his incredible use of light and shading gave the book a true horrific feel.<br /><br />Gene would eventually leave Marvel in the early 1980's after several run-ins with then Editor-in-Chief, Jim Shooter.  Shooter's tenure was marred by one controversy after another including his shameful treatment of Jack Kirby.  Shooter was highly critical of Gene's work and harassed him with constant demands of changes.  Gene would migrate to DC along with many other former Marvel staffers who had grown tired of Shooter including Roy Thomas, Len Wein, and Marv Wolfman.  To be fair, Tom Field presents both sides in the Colan/Shooter situation.  He allows Shooter to give his side of the story in which he feels he was doing what was right for the company and felt Gene was cutting corners with his work.  Unfortunately Shooter's credibility is almost nil due to his run-ins with so many other artists and writers.<br /><br />At DC Gene would work on Batman, Wonder Woman, Detective, and new projects such as Night Force and Nathaniel Dusk.  Gene would find himself under attack again for his art, this time by John Byrne who was highly critical of Gene in a Comics Journal interview in 1982.  Byrne would basically call Gene a cheat and say that 90% of the time you could not tell what was happening on the page.  I credit Field for including this in the book.  I would guess he knew that rather than be any kind of indictment against Gene, that it would make Byrne look like a jerk for making an unwarranted attack on a true legend.  Cheat?  Byrne is still giving every character that same weird looking, rectangular mouth for twenty-five years!<br /><br />Gene would leave DC some years later after similar criticisms by then Editor Dick Giordano.  Gene would strictly freelance from now on and even go back to work at Marvel (shooter has since been broomed himself).  Today, Gene has found many new outlets for his work thanks to the internet.  He's busy doing commissions for fans who truly appreciate his work.<br /><br />Tom Field presents a portrait of a man who fits the nickname of \\"Gentleman Gene\\".  Colan's volume of work over the last sixty years is awe-inspiring.  It's great to see Gene finally getting the tribute he so justly deserves.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson.

Start out with that fantastic cover of Salma Hayek from Dogma and move on to an entire collection from one of the most talented artists in the business today.  Subtitled \\"Bad Girls Drawn Nicely\\" this book from SQP is the first sketchbook collection from the brilliant hand of Dave Nestler.  Nestler has already established himself as one of the great modern masters of erotic pin-up art and this book is a prime example.  It presents 64 pages of luscious, sexy, and oh so naughty females, rendered in beautiful pencil illustrations.  Calling this a sketch book makes it perhaps sound as if these are rough drawings but don't let that fool you.  These are completed and polished drawings, suitable for framing.<br /><br />Nestler has a true eye for capturing women in their most subtle nuances with a fine-line detail that is unrivaled today.  His anatomies are flawless and the eyes of the Nestler women enchant the reader.  Check out the beauty lying on a stylish, Art Deco sofa, one breast exposed, seemingly waiting for her lover to come home.  Then check out the gorgeous sun Goddess, pouring cool, refreshing water from a shell down over her body as she soaks up the sun.  Catch a glimpse into the bedroom of a lovely woman as she readies herself for the evening in leather garter and bustier, and is busy attaching her stockings.  A truly sensuous piece features a topless, delectable piece of cheesecake in a French maid skirt.<br /><br />The examples are too numerous to try and highlight them all.  This is one of the finest pin-up sketch books I've ever seen.  Nestler points out in the introduction to this volume that this is the time he has worked exclusively in pencils since he was in art school and he obviously hasn't lost a step.  While the majority of the drawings feature full or topless illustrations there are also a number of great facial portraits as well.  A first-rate collection!  Sal Quartuccio continues to publish the finest in erotic fantasy and pin-up art.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim JansonReviewed by Tim Janson	2005-09-07

Over the past twenty years or so, Horne has become one of the top cover illustrators of fantasy books, painting literally hundreds of covers as well as illustrating for Dragon Magazine, toy packaging art, producing posters, and sculptures for the Middle Earth action figure line.<br /><br />The Daniel Horne Sketchbook displays a magnificent sampling of his work from rough layouts to finished illustration, often comparing the two side-by-side so you can see the progression of his work.  Horne also provides artist commentary on many of the drawings in the book which is a real treat, especially for aspiring artists.<br /><br />One of my favorite pieces, and one of Horne's fan's favorites as well, was a cover he did for Dragon Magazine depicting an enormous, armored skeleton, its body filled with arrows charging forward to assail a female archer.  I think it's probably the most memorable cover in the history of Dragon Magazine.  Horne's work is filled with images of classic fantasy:  Trolls, dragons, wizards, damsels in distress, warriors, and all manner of beastly creatures.  Another wonder piece is a humorous illustration of a Valkyrie Warrior riding atop a disinterested donkey.  I also love the illustration of an Elven mermaid entitled \\"River Daughter's Lament\\"<br /><br />While we mainly know Horne through his unparalleled finished cover paintings, it's interesting to take a glimpse at his sketch work to see it in the earliest stages.  Sometimes I think we tend to see a finished piece and not fully realize just how much work goes into it.  In addition to his paintings, Horne has also done a great deal of sculpting and design work for toy companies such as Hasbro, Toy Biz, Mattel, and others.  This book shows why Horne is one of the top fantasy artists in the business.	2005-09-07

Sure, I knew he was a comic artist but I never realized just what an outstanding talent he was until I checked out his book from Vanguard Productions.  I guess one reason while I was unfamiliar with Cardy was that he got out of the comic book industry in the mid-1970's, just after I started getting into comics.  Plus, Cardy worked primarily for DC while I read mainly Marvel titles.  \\"The Art of Nick Cardy\\" traces his roots from his earliest days through the present when Nick was \\"re-discovered\\" by many modern day fans when he began to make convention appearances.  Nick relates his story through a book-length interview with writer John Coates.<br /><br />Cardy got his start working at the Will Eisner/Jerry Iger studio with other well-known artists such as Lou Fine and George Tuska.  For some reason it always surprises me to learn that so many of the artists that I enjoyed in the 1970's got their start back in the dawn of the Golden Age.  I always considered comics a \\"young man's\\" game I suppose.  On display in the book is many of Cardy's great early covers for comics like Jumbo Comics and Jungle comics, depicting Sheena Queen of the Jungle.  It's just gorgeous stuff with a breath-taking, pulp magazine-style look.<br /><br />Cardy would move to DC in 1948 working on a number of non-superhero titles.  Modern comic fans seem horribly unaware of the number of non-superhero titles that DC and other publishers used to put out back in the 40's and 50's.  In fact many crime, western, romance, and war comics outsold many superhero titles and it's a shame that many of these comics have been forgotten.  Nick worked on titles like \\"Legends of Daniel Boone\\", \\"Tomahawk\\", and \\"Congo Bill\\".<br /><br />Cardy is perhaps best known for his 60's and 70's work on Aquaman and the original Teen Titans series.  Nick discusses both books in detail and talks about how keeping up on the changing fashions and trends was a challenge for a book like Teen Titans.  The book reprints many of Cardy's outstanding covers for titles such as Superman, Action, The Spectre, Ghosts, The Flash, and the Witching Hour.  He was equally adept at doing action-packed superhero comics as he was terrifying horror titles.  I became an instant fan just admiring this cover gallery.<br /><br />Cardy would tire of the comic industry and leave in the 1970's to pursue work in other areas such as film and TV work, doing posters for the movies \\"Bad News Bears in Breaking Training\\" and \\"California Suite\\".  Cardy seems genuinely surprised and humbled about the acclaim he is now getting late in life.  The book features tributes to Nick from many comic luminaries like Julie Schwartz, Carmine Infantino, Marv Wolfman, Dick Giordano, and others.<br /><br />This book was a real pleasure for me to read.  Cardy is a artist who deserves to be mention right up there with the greats of the 1960's comic artists like Kirby, Buscema, Adams, and Steranko.  Hopefully this book will help other comic fans be introduced to the wonderful art of Nick Cardy.

The Rat Pack and Tiki Lounges, fondue, booze, and Capri pants.  Josh Agle, known to his friends and fans as \\"Shag\\" is perhaps the Andy Warhol of the 21st century, capturing a look and feel of the pop-culture of the 1960's unlike to artist before him.  Agle's work first came to prominence in the mid 1990's when his work was show at a Tiki art show.  Agle's use of color schemes is a major attraction of his art and sets the mood of each piece...purples and blues for a winter hideaway, shipping cocktails by the fireplace and reds and yellows for an out-on-the-town frolic with the devil.  Agle's art tells a story and often there's other stories going on in the back ground so you'll find yourself studying each piece to note the expressions of the characters.<br /><br />Chances are you've see Agles, hip, and funky cool art on greeting cards, t-shirts, CD covers, gift wrap, and other items and been impressed by the quirky, playful sense of humor of the artist.  \\"Bear Rug\\" shows a couple lying on a bear skin rug while a peeved looking LIVE bear peers in through their window.<br /><br />\\"Take Five\\" is a brilliant jazz-themed piece featuring a woman dancing to a Dave Brubeck album while an angry wolf sits on the 60's style sofa.  One can only wonder what he's thinking about.  \\"Mitchum & Bellafonta in Trinidad\\" features the two icons bellying up to a bar.  In \\"Prelude to Domestic Violence\\" the wife is seen berating her husband, the Frankenstein monster.  \\"Death's Unending Vacation\\" finds the Grim Reaper trying to enjoy his trip but being annoyed by a drunken tourist.<br /><br />Agle tackles numerous themes throughout the book including mythology, music, astrology, women, Tiki, travel, and so much more.  Also throughout his works you'll find clever product placements for Gordon's Gin, Jim Beam, and others.<br /><br />This is a truly outstanding tribute to the pop culture of the 1960's.	2005-09-07

Ultra: Seven Days is a unique look at the superhero genre presented by Joshua and Jonathan Luna who plotted, scripted, drew, inked, colored, and even lettered this book.  Ultra is one of the greatest female superheroes in the world.  Superheroes in this story are roughly akin to professional athletes in our world.  They endorse products such as soft drinks, cosmetics, and perfumes.  They are represented by large public relations firms such as the Heroine Agency and they are the stuff of tabloid gossip.<br /><br />We meet Pearl Penalosa AKA Ultra.  She is one of the most popular heroes in the world with millions of fans and admirers, a female version of Superman if there ever was one.  She's even been nominated for Heroine of the year in a red carpet event as illustrious as the Oscars.  She puts her duty before her own personal life.  Pearl is out on the town for a night of fun with her friends Olivia and Jennifer (Also heroes known as Aphrodite and Cowgirl respectively)  The trio pay a visit to a local fortune teller who looks every bit like a charlatan to get their fortunes told.  It's there they learn that Ultra, always unlucky in love, will meet her true love within seven days.<br /><br />Pearl thinks the whole fortune-telling thing is pure nonsense, until she meets a regular guy that she falls head over heels in love with.  Taking him into her confidence, although her real identity is out in the open as most heroes are, she has a steamy night of passion with him, only to find that he was a paid stooge, selling his story to a sleazy tabloid publisher, destroying Ultra's untainted reputation in the eyes of her legions of fans.  Her agency immediately goes on damage control as her boss gives her the \\"I told you so\\" speech when it comes to watching who she associates with.<br /><br /> Pearl now finds herself ostracized by the public and subject to taunts and insults from the people who once adored her. This leads to an ugly verbal fight between her and Olivia.  On top of all of Pearl's personal problems, a new and very deadly villain has hit town.  A superhuman pyro-kinetic who is using his powers to set devastating fires all over the city and taking a number of superheroes down who try and stop him.  Ultra now has to pull herself together and forget her personal troubles to try and take down this threat before more people are killed.<br /><br />Ultra is a Superhero book, certainly, but the Luna brothers have constructed a Superhero book with dysfunctional characters that would make Stan Lee green with envy.  Pearl is a workaholic hero obsessed with her clean image to the point of virtually having no private life.  Olivia (Aphrodite) is an admitted nymphomaniac, unable to commit to a stable relationship.  Cowgirl is naïve and insecure, always following the lead of others.  Throughout the book the Luna brothers gives readers great renditions of faux advertisements and newspaper/magazine articles featuring their heroines doing ads for products like \\"Levy's jeans\\" and other well-known product parodies.  This helps bring the reader into this world of heroes as media shills and it's very well done.<br /><br />The plot is not action-packed...there are only a handful of fights.  This is not a superhero tale about action but rather the flip-side of being a hero. In many respects, the real lives of these heroes are the masks they hide behind and they escape into their super personas to get away from their troubled, and often mundane private lives.  This was my first exposure to the work of the Luna brothers and I am very impressed.  Despite the lack of action, they pace the story well and it's never dull.  Their minimalist art was also a welcome reprieve from the typical in-your-face, splash page-heavy art of many of their contemporaries.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonults from the people who once adored her.

Pearl is a workaholic hero obsessed with her clean image to the point of virtually having no private life.  Olivia (Aphrodite) is an admitted nymphomaniac, unable to commit to a stable relationship.  Cowgirl is nave and insecure, always following the lead of others.  Throughout the book the Luna brothers gives readers great renditions of faux advertisements and newspaper/magazine articles featuring their heroines doing ads for products like \\"Levy's jeans\\" and other well-known product parodies.  This helps bring the reader into this world of heroes as media shills and it's very well done.   <br /> <br />The plot is not action-packed...there are only a handful of fights.  This is not a superhero tale about action but rather the flip-side of being a hero. In many respects, the real lives of these heroes are the masks they hide behind and they escape into their super personas to get away from their troubled, and often mundane private lives.  This was my first exposure to the work of the Luna brothers and I am very impressed.  Despite the lack of action, they pace the story well and it's never dull.  Their minimalist art was also a welcome reprieve from the typical in-your-face, splash page-heavy art of many of their contemporaries.   <br /> <br />Reviewed by Tim Janson <br />	2005-09-07

Guys like Todd McFarlane, Whilce Portacio, Rob Liefeld, Erik Larsen, John Romita Jr., and many more, were taking comic readers by storm.  But the guy who I thought was the best out of this vast group was Jim Lee.  One can debate artistic talent all you want and I'll not say Lee was a better artist than any of these gentlemen.  What I liked about Lee was how his panels flowed.  I thought he told a better story than most other young artists who relied more on flash and pin-up pages.  Lee's art always had a more cinematic feel to it and I became an instant fan.  With Lee's Wildstorm Productions now under the DC banner, he has had the chance to work on DC's biggest heroes: Batman & Superman.  That all brings me to this hardcover collection Superman:  For Tomorrow Volume 2, collecting issues #210 - 215 of the Superman comic.<br /><br />For Tomorrow continues the story began in the first collection.  Million of citizens of Earth have simply vanished into thin air including Lois Lane.  Superman begins to finally figure out the mystery and what's worse, he finds he may be indirectly responsible.  He begins the dangerous plan to try and rescue the missing people with the aid of a powerful device.  But this plan draws him into conflict first with Batman, and then with Wonder Woman in a no-punches pulled brawl has the Amazonian comes armed with a magic dagger.<br /><br />Superman eventually finds himself drawn into an alternate dimension in a seemingly idyllic world, vaguely familiar.  But the tranquility is soon shattered by a troublesome band of marauders including a bestial foe called Equus.  As Superman defends the people he is eventually confronted by a mysterious villain from Krypton's past, setting up a deadly climax.<br /><br />For Tomorrow is a different Superman than were used to seeing.  He's certainly grimmer, brought on by the realization of his role in the vanishing of all of these people.  His conflict with Batman, while only verbal, is perhaps the harshest stance we've ever seen him take with the Caped Crusader.  Even Batman was taken aback by what Superman had to say to him.  His battle with Wonder Woman, while short, showed that he was not going to let her interfere with what he had to do.  Jim Lee's pencils, along with Scott Williams' inks are a perfect complement to this darker storyline.  I found the contrast between the austere darkness of our world and the lush serenity of the alternate world to be interesting.  The people who were kidnapped clearly found this strange new world more to their liking.  The revealing of the villain and the origin of the vanishings was well thought out and took me by surprise.<br /><br />My only nit would be with the rather choppy dialog of writer Brian Azzarello.  While plotted well, the dialog in some spots is clumsy and fragmented and characters are constantly talking over other characters.  It's a minor complaint but it is one that definitely hurts the flow of an otherwise strong story.  All in all, though, a very good story highlighted by the always outstanding Jim Lee art.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonle in the vanishing of all of these people.

Superman:  \\"Infinite City\\" is a new hard cover graphic novel from the team of writer Mike Kennedy and Argentinian artist Carlos Meglia.  This was the first time I had seen Meglia's art and I was extremely impressed.  Infinite City is an interesting tale in that Superman plays basically a supporting role up until the very end of the story.<br /><br />\\"Infinite City\\" begins as Superman has to take down a two-bit criminal armed with a weapon of obvious alien origin.  The weapon was made in a place called Infinite City and Superman and Lois travel there to investigate.  What they find is just an old ghost town and a deserted, roadside diner.  But when Lois walks through a doorway she soon finds herself transported into a vast world of strange technology and even stranger inhabitants.  Lois is quickly captured by these strange forces and convinced that these aliens can help the Earth with their technology, but that their robotic mayor prevents them from opening gateways into our world.<br /><br />Superman soon follows and gets a vastly different side of things from the mayor, a robot who claims to be Superman's father Jor-El.  The machine claims that he is the consciousness of Jor-El.  He explains that his plan to save the people of Krypton involved re-creating Krypton inside of a pocket universe, but he did not have enough time.  Instead the infant Kal-El was sent to Earth where Jor-El had expected him to become a king.  Not only does Superman find out that his father is still alive (sort of) but he also finds out that Infinite City's powerful protector is Superman's brother (sort of), created from a lock of his hair.  Throughout the story Superman finds himself pushed to the sidelines as his powers are wildly erratic in this strange world and he finds he's doing more harm than good.  But when Jor-El discovers that these rebels plan to break through a new gateway into our world Superman is determined to get involved, especially since Lois is in their clutches.<br /><br />Infinite City is an interesting concept as it re-thinks what was going through Jor-El's mind before the destruction of Krypton.  We see that sending his baby Kal-El away was done as a last resort.  How will this set with Superman traditionalists?  Well it should not bother them at all since in the end nothing about Supe's origin is changed.  Mike Kennedy merely is filling in some gaps in Kryptonian history.  The story itself is a bit frenzied and a couple of times I found myself having a hard time figuring out just who were the good guys and who were the bad guys.<br /><br />The art of Carlos Meglia really pushed this book over the top for me.  His style doesn't seem all too similar to anyone else's.  His art has a very cartoon-like quality to it, almost like reading an animated feature.  His work is lively and expressive and captured the chaotic look and feel of Infinite City perfectly.  I certainly look forward to seeing more from Mr. Meglia.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson/> <br />Infinite City is an interesting concept as it re-thinks what was going through Jor-El's mind before the destruction of Krypton.

79969:US	51142763	R18NJB056K02NG	1893905489	567381546	The Justice League Companion	Books	5	11	13	N	N	A CELEBRATION OF THE JUSTICE LEAGUE	When I first started reading comics in the early 1970's, I was almost exclusively a Marvel fan and didn't read many DC comics at all.  I was lucky enough to have an older brother who as a big DC can and among the books in his collection was a full run of Justice League of America from #50 through #120.  Reading his comics (when he wasn't around, of course) was my introduction to one of the great superhero teams of all time and I ended up becoming a big fan.  The Justice League companion is a 45th anniversary celebration of the team as well as a fascinating and informative tome of JLA lore.  Writer Michael Eury gives JLA a vast treasure trove of trivia and interviews that gives the reader everything they ever wanted to know about the first super team of the Silver Age.<br /><br />Eury begins with a FAQ section with answers supplied primarily by JLA creator Julius Schwartz that was culled from interviews with the legendary DC editor.  Julie tells how the birth of the JLA came out of the popular success of the revivals of Golden Age characters The Flash and Green Lantern.  JLA would be a revival of the Justice Society with Schwartz changing the name from \\"society\\" to \\"league\\".  Schwartz goes on to explain why certain members were either included or excluded into the team's membership and the battle with Superman and Batman editors over how much those characters should be utilized in the JLA title.  Schwartz also discusses the various JLA/JSA crossovers and the creation of Earth 2.  In an interesting bit of trivia, he relates that calling the world of the JSA Earth 2, even though its characters came first, was simply an oversight!<br /><br />In an exclusive interview that Eury conducted in 2004, Stan Lee recounts how his boss, Martin Goodman, mandated that Stan create a super team to compete with the very popular Justice League, and thus came up with the Fantastic Four.<br /><br />One of the most interesting interviews in the book was with Roy Thomas and Jerry Bails, the creators of one of the earliest, and certainly most famous fanzines, Alter-Ego, in the early 1960's.  His work on the fanzine, and the connections he made in the comic industry would eventually lead Thomas to Marvel in the mid-1960s where he would become their top writer and later Editor-in-Chief.  Thomas and Bails discuss those early years and their correspondences with people like Schwartz and Murphy Anderson and how some of their early ideas were incorporated into the JLA.<br /><br />Thomas also talks about the secret JLA/Avengers cross-over (sort of) that took place in Avengers # 70 and Justice League #75.  Thomas created the Squadron Sinister with a team of villains based on JLA members, while Denny O' Neil did, as I recall, a Halloween story in which the JLA encounter somewhat altered versions of the Avengers Thor & Captain America...and Captain Marvel, although curiously it was the Fawcett Captain Marvel.  Other interviews in the book include Murphy Anderson, Denny O' Neil, and Mike Friedrich.<br /><br />The book is simply loaded with valuable information about the JLA, although the info is limited to the Silver Age.  It includes a timeline of all super teams created in the Silver Age from the Black Hawks in 1957 to the Defenders in 1971.  There is also a splendid index to every JLA/JSA crossover of the Silver Age including a full cover gallery.  Eury also includes Bios on those artists and writers who worked on the JLA in the Silver Age including Gardner Fox, Mike Sekowsky. Neal Adams, Murphy Anderson, Schwartz, O' Neil, and all the rest.  One of my favorite things in the book is the alternate covers of various comics.  For example one shows the cover to Fantastic Four #1 but with the JLA battling the gargantuan creature instead of the FF.  Another features a JLA cover with the Avengers.<br /><br />Michael Eury did a fantastic job on this book.  His interviews were informative and lively and the wealth of information is just astounding.  A must have for fans of the Justice League.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim JansonJanson	2005-09-01

Teacher Jane Schoenberg and her husband Steven, a Musician, have teamed up to create a wonderful book/CD combo explaining to kids all about how the body works.  The songs deal with body functions like movement and muscles, the brain, breathing, and even passing gas.  They not only wrote the book but they also perform all of the songs.  The music was quite fun and my three year old enjoys many of the songs.  The lyrics are catchy, here is an example:<br /><br />Your brain keeps sending messages right out,<br /><br />Tells you to be quiet, and tells you when to shout,<br /><br />Tells you when you're happy, tells you when you're sad,<br /><br />Tells you when you're feeling hot or cold or hurting bad.<br /><br />Simple but rhythmic which kids will enjoy.  Nicely illustrated as well.  Great for pre-schoolers up to grade 1 at least.	2005-08-30

These dark, gothic images of sensual female vampires by some of the top artists in fantasy and erotic art are always a treat for the eyes.  Crimson Embrace Vol. 5 is no different as it presents 64 pages of luscious vampire art starting off with a cover by Greg Loudon and featuring artists such as Fastner & Larson, Daniel Pascarelli, Mike Hoffman, James Ryman, Gerard Gallego, and many more.<br /><br />Gerard Gallego presents the domineering vampire as a blonde vamp is using her submissive slave as a lounge chair.  Gallego is also the creator of the most erotic piece in the book, as a hot female vamp straddles her nude victim as blood flows down her chest.  Fastner & Larson are always at the top of their game with their beautiful and care-free illustrations of females and they provide some great pieces for this latest edition including a trio of sexy, sultry vampires cavorting before a full moon, and a pair of barfly beauties sipping their cocktails while their latest victim grasps at his freshly bitten throat.<br /><br />James Ryman is another one of my favorites whose work always evokes a sense of bestial power.  This is well displayed in his nude, bat-winged vampire and his vampire mermaid, swimming away from a fresh kill.  Daniel Pascarelli shows the neck is not the only place a vampire likes to take a bit out of as he draws a snarling vampire sinking her fangs into the backside of her female prey.  Villagers are enacting their vengeance on a vampire, burning her at a stake in a powerful piece by Mitch Byrd.<br /><br />Crimson Embrace continues to set be a trendsetter in the field of dark, erotic art.  The diversity of talent each volume presents is outstanding.  Another great offering from SQ Productions!	2005-08-30

Carlos Diez is one of the rising stars of erotic pin-up art who blends a brassy modern day look with a classic pin-up style for an original and captivating look.  He has quickly become one of the hottest and most sought after artists by models and has illustrated covers for dozens of CD, Books, and magazines.  This full-color collection from SQ Productions features 104 pages of his stunning pin-up art in an over-sized format and printed on heavy, glossy stock paper.  If you never seen Diez' artwork previously you are in for a real feast for the eyes.  Diez' photo-realistic figures and dazzling use of color is pure genius.<br /><br />Throughout the book you'll see illustrations with titles like \\"Woman with Tennis Racket\\" but you'll know that this is none other than Russian tennis player and sex-pot Anna Kournikova.  And the subject of \\"Brunette in Water\\" in her tiny, blue bikini, frolicking about is gorgeous actress Catherine Zeta Jones.  A number of different, unnamed celebrities are the subject of Diez' lush illustrations including Nicole Kidman, Anna Nicole Smith, Angelina Jolie, Peta Wilson, Penelope Cruz, and many more.  You'll see some of the gorgeous actresses in a whole new light!  Cameron Diaz is a favorite subject of Diez and appears in several pieces in the book including one where the lovely miss Diaz stands-in for the famous Universal Pictures statue in a painting called \\"Cameron Universal\\".  Diez also does a very alluring and erotic Bettie Page dressed in an outfit made of leather straps.<br /><br />Like other artist collections from SQP, this book has an index to each painting giving the title and form used to create the piece.  Showing off the traditional, playfulness of classic 1940's pin-up art is a painting entitled \\"Yoo Hoo! Look at Me!\\" featuring a gorgeous, buxom blonde dressed in garter and fishnets playing peek-a-boo.  Diez presents several different Marilyn Monroe paintings including one with the bombshell dressed in Daisy Dukes jean cutoffs and cowboy boots and another with her dressed in fishnets and high heels sitting on a suitcase.  \\"Miss Santa\\" represents another of Carlos' tributes to classic pin-ups with a gorgeous, topless brunette wearing a red garter, stockings, and a Santa cap resting on a large Christmas present.  One can only hope that she will come down your chimney some day.<br /><br />In addition to his pin-up part which makes up the vast majority of the book, several other selections are also included such as comic book portraits of the X-Men, Spiderman, Aliens and other works of dark fantasy.

Del Nido is unique among fantasy/erotic artists in that he works digitally, using various software programs to create his illustrations.  As explained in the introduction, this allows Jose to simulate various styles of painting such as oils, acrylics, and air-brushing, combined with the digital ability to fashion stunning uses of lighting, color, shading, and reflection.  The result is some of the most darkly beautiful artwork I've ever experienced.  Del Nido's women convey a sense of erotic danger, even from those who find themselves captive to dark forces.  This is an over-sized, soft cover book printed on heavy, glossy stock that collectors will certainly appreciate.  As with the other fine art collections from SQP, the back of the book has an index to each of the paintings that provide the title of the piece and the medium in which it was created.<br /><br />The pieces in this collection range from females captured and at the mercy of bestial creatures and demons, to powerful, domineering women whose seductiveness is only overshadowed by her power.  In \\"Winged Devil\\", a lovely nude woman is chained as a great winged demon hovers behind her; her supple white skin a contrast to the foreboding gloom of the background.  \\"Anxiety\\" is a haunting illustration as a blonde woman is bound, her eyes tightly closed as she awaits her fate as a sacrifice to a dragon.  An enticing Enchantress is mounted upon a giant rat in \\"Sewers\\" as she traverses the dank underground tunnels of some long-forgotten city.<br /><br />The power of Del Nido's women is on display in \\"Fight to the Death\\" as a female gladiator stands over the fallen form of giant beast while the crowd in the gladiatorial arena roars its approval.  In a piece brimming with gothic mood, a winged, female vampire stands poised atop a castle's walls while several large bats fly against the full moon.  Another female vampire is the subject of \\"Wishing Well\\", this time a red-haired beauty with an evil grin and blood trickling down her chin and breasts.  \\"Offering\\" evokes a horrific sense of evil as a woman is bound by chains to a pillar while a group of hooded cultists encircle her.  One can only imagine the dreadful fate that awaits her.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite piece in the book (Although it's impossible to pick a favorite) may be one entitled \\"Lucifer's Wives\\".  The Dark Lord Lucifer stands atop an alter, a bubbling vat of blood in front of him while his two blond vampire brides lie seductively on the ground before them.  The dark imagery of this illustration is truly magnificent.  You'll find yourself looking at these pieces over and over as you marvel at the skill and imagination that Del Nido possesses.

Sal Quartuccio continues to give an outlet to a very diverse and talented assortment of fantasy and erotic artists.  This is the first of the three volumes currently available in the Gallery Girls Mermaids series.  Mermaids have always had that enchanting allure of beauty for men of the sea.  While these creatures of myth are usually presented as peaceful, playful, and perhaps a bit mischievous, many of the artists in Mermaids Volume One have a different perspective on them.  The book starts out with a gorgeous, painted, wrap-around cover by Joe Chiodo whose style is well-matched to the lighthearted side of mermaids.  The interior artists include Daniel Pascarelli, Tomas Giorello, Jose Torres, James Ryman, Pelaez, and Mike Hoffman.<br /><br />Pascarelli takes a fairly traditional approach as he shows two mermaids, a blonde and a brunette, lying on a rocky shore, soaking up the sun.  Another Pascarelli piece features a blonde mermaid lounging inside of a giant clam.  Mike Hoffman presents a gorgeous piece with a mermaid, armed with a trident, battling a male warrior.  Hoffman is one of my new favorites among fantasy artists due to his strong Frazetta influence and his art stands as a tribute to that true master of fantasy art.  Showing that not all mermaids are playful, Artist Quintabani has two mermaids locked underwater in a duel to the death.  James Ryman probably gets the honor for most horrific piece in the collection as a beautiful mermaid finds herself facing an enormous beast that is part humanoid, part crab, and part octopus that looks like it just walked out of a Robert E. Howard story.<br /><br />A strong-willed mermaid rides a mammoth great white shark in a piece by Boada, and Capdevila provides a picturesque work of a tranquil shoreline with a mermaid reclining on the beach as seagulls fly overhead.  The great Pelaez has a number of outstanding pieces in the book including one showing a mermaid discovering the bones of an ancient seaman at the bottom of the ocean.  Whether these creatures are lying serenely on the shore or battling fierce beasts far below the ocean's surface, this initial collection promises to be a great new series in the Gallery Girls line.

The Gallery Girls collections from SQP are some of my most favorite collections of fantasy art since they present such an eclectic variety of talents.  Previous Gallery Girls collections have put the spotlight on Vampires (Crimson Embrace series), Witches (Coven series), Pirates (Treasured Chests) and Jungle Women (Jungle Tails) to name just a few.  Angel Lust is a new Gallery Girls collection and as the title suggests, it features illustrations of seductive, erotic angels by some of the finest talents in fantasy art.  Like the other books in the Gallery Girls series, this is a soft cover, magazine-sized book with black & white, primarily pencil illustrations.  The roll call for Angel Lust includes: Mitch Byrd, Diego Greco, Pedro Cuevas, Danilo Guida, Brian Le Blanc, German Ponce, and several more.<br /><br />The different take each artist has on the subject matter is what makes the Gallery Girls books so interesting.  Some present Angels as playful and shy, others as great warriors, battling hordes of evil.  Still others take a more ominous approach depicting their angels as tragic victims, falling to dark powers akin to many old Renaissance-era paintings.  There is no end to the diversity.  Danilo Guida presents one of the aforementioned darker pieces showing an angel being accosted by a legion of demons, as her clothes are torn to shreds.  Brian LeBlanc illustrates a rather humorous piece of a beautiful warrior angel directing two male Cherubic angels into battle.<br /><br />A Titanic, God-like angel is the center of attention in a piece by German Ponce as an angel that dwarfs the Earth, stands holding handfuls of agonized men in her hands, perhaps on the way to their final, eternal damnation.  Diego Greco provides a much lighter illustration showing a pair of \\"storm angels\\", lying on a cloud, one holding a watering can and the other a handful of lighting bolts, preparing to send a potent storm down upon the planet.  The angel is a Diego Candia drawing finds herself captured by Satan himself.  In yet another fantastic piece, Danilo Guida depicts a Templar, or some other Holy Knight bowing before a celestial, warrior angel, not unlike a Valkyrie from Norse mythology.  My favorite illustration in the book is one by Luis Buci that shows a horrified blonde, nude angel being restrained by dozens of demonic tentacles, laden with spikes and tiny mouths with razor-sharp fangs.<br /><br />The book also sports a painted cover by Paleaz.

My favorite illustration in the book is one by Luis Buci that shows a horrified blonde, nude angel being restrained by dozens of demonic tentacles, laden with spikes and tiny mouths with razor-sharp fangs. <br /> <br />The book also sports a painted cover by Paleaz.

I enjoy all of the Gallery Girls collections since they provide such a wide diversity of talent with very different artistic styles.  My favorites, though, have always been the ones that celebrate the dark female such as the witches of the Coven series and the vampires of Crimson Embrace.  As with the other Gallery Girls books the art here is presented in black & white pencil, pen & ink illustrations.  Joe Jusko gets things started with a great, full-color cover.  Other artists featured in Volume 6 include:  Arantza, Pedro Cuevas, Tomas Giorello, Brian Le Blanc, and Jim Fern.<br /><br />Anyone who has read my previous reviews knows that I am a big fan of Spanish artist Arantza so it should come as no surprise that one of her drawings is among my most favorites in this latest volume.  Her depiction of a Victorian era blonde vampire bursting forth from her tomb, dressed in a sexy negligee is simply breath-taking, as is most of her work. Another Arantza example is of a bat-winged, blonde vampire resting atop a tomb in an ancient grave yard.  Enric presents a horrific vision of a brutish, demon like vampire tormenting a near-naked blonde woman who is chained and at its mercy.  Marcelo Fleitas contributes a truly dark and gothic illustration of a vampire shepherdess walking through a cemetery while a subservient male kneels at her side.<br /><br />A pair of erotic vamps, frolicking in a pool of blood is Federico Ossio's contribution to this volume and it's a gem.  Lorenzo Lorente provides the most gruesome illustration this time out with a modern day vamp that has just taken her latest victim in a men's room and holds a ghastly trophy in her hand...the man's severed head!  Beheading is also the theme of a piece by Javier Lara as a short-haired vamp returns to her tomb clutching another poor victim's head, as blood flows down her faced and chin.  Another favorite of mine, Paleaz shows a vampire creeping up on her next victim who is sleeping and wearing only panties.  Will the crucifix around her neck save her?  Lorente, yet another rising star, has a second outstanding, and darkly sensuous piece in this book, this time showing a nude vampire, a trail of blood flowing the length of her body, clasping her breasts in front of a mountain of skulls.<br /><br />This is one of the best volumes I've yet to see in the Gallery Girls collections.  The art is uniformly fantastic throughout.  Darkly atmospheric and moody, all of these artists set a great tone.  A Goth fan's dream!im's head, as blood flows down her faced and chin.

There's only one thing that keeps \\"A Halloween How-To\\" from being the perfect Halloween book and that is that there are no color photographs.  That one little drawback aside, this is maybe the best book on Halloween I've ever seen and I've reviewed a LOT of them.  Unlike some of the more cutesy-crafty books on the market, this book is more designed for the real Halloween aficionado.  This is the person whose more interested in scaring the pants off trick or treaters rather than winning an award from the neighborhood garden committee.<br /><br />The first chapter covers tips on decorating your hose and yard and range from the simple to the very elaborate.  Fake Tombstones can be pretty expensive if you buy them in the stores but this book shows how you can make them inexpensively from builder's foam and some paint.  Another quick project is the quarter (or more) of dancing lawn ghosts made with old bed sheets stuffed with plastic bags on wooden dowel rods and then arranged in a circle.  More elaborate projects can be made by a concoction called Monster Mud, which can be used to mold creatures from.  Tips on proper lighting for your outdoor display are included as well.  The second chapter covers everything you need to know about choosing, carving, and preserving your pumpkin.  A great trip is rubbing it with petroleum jelly or vegetable oil after you carve it to keep it from drying out too fast.<br /><br />Chapter three deals with costumes and make-up, and features designs for fifty different homemade costumes, and patterns for making things like capes and hooded robes.  Beyond that it provides techniques for spattering blood on clothing or giving your clothing an aged, rotted look.  There are also recipes for making your own costume blood from corn syrup and red food coloring.<br /><br />Parties are covered in chapter four and these are squarely aimed at adults with various themed parties such as gothic or Victorian theme.  Ideas for d&eacute;cor, invitations, recipes and games are included along suggested Halloween readings from such classic writers as Poe and Ambrose Bierce.  They even tell you how to hold your own s&eacute;ance!  Chapter five is a nice accompaniment with its suggestions for music, sound effects and the best scary films to watch on Halloween.  One of my favorites is \\"The Lady in Whites\\". Chapter six follows up with dozens of recipes.<br /><br />The longest chapter in the book and my personal favorite is the one on Haunted Destinations.  The author takes the reader on a whirlwind tour of some of the best and creepiest destinations to visit during the Halloween season.  The witch-haunted town of Salem, MA, has their three week long Haunted Happenings that begins the second week of October with various parades, parties, candlelight tours of haunted sites throughout the region.  Take a trip to Sleepy Hollow in New York for their annual Halloween festivities or down to New Orleans to visit the Voodoo museum or the famous cemetery crypts.  Other destinations include tours of the Edgar Allan Poe gravesite in Baltimore, the Lizzie Borden Bed & Breakfast in Fall River, Bachelor's Grove Cemetery outside of Chicago, and many other ghostly sites.  The book also lists some of the more famous seasonal Halloween attractions like haunted houses and hayride out on by various cities throughout the country.<br /><br />The book concludes by taking a look at some of the more infamous Halloween myths and current trends of the Halloween holiday.  This book just has a wealth of information and is the most comprehensive I've ever read.  It's a true celebration of the Halloween season.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansoncipes and games are included along suggested Halloween readings from such classic writers as Poe and Ambrose Bierce.

It was at a big comic book show in the Detroit area and Dorian was one of the many artists there.  Behind him on display was a painting of the character of Julie from Return of the Living Dead part III.  The painting depicted Julie just after she has self-mutilated her body with needles, wire, chains, and shards of glass.  It's the most shocking scene in the film and Dorian brilliantly captured this scene.  Trinity is the third collection of Dorian's work from SQP and delivers 104 pages of Dorian's full-color paintings including many two-page spreads.  This is an over-sized book printed on glossy stock, designed for the collector.<br /><br />Cleavenger's women are beautiful, but dark and dangerous and often seem tinged with a deep sadness which mystifies the viewer.  His creations can seem to have been born right out of the Garden of Eden, or right out of the very depths of hell.  You'll find mostly the latter in this collection.  The striking thing about Dorian's art is that this isn't the stuff of mere pin-ups.  Each painting seems to have its own dark story it wants to tell.  The book begins with a biography of Cleavenger and throughout the book he shares his thoughts on his creative process, the use of models, and other subjects.  The great pieces are too many to list as Cleavenger is always consistently good, but let me note a few of my favorite paintings in this book.<br /><br />\\"Vampire Slayer\\" finds an erotic and over-powering female vampire who has just dispatched the foolish vampire slayer who sought to drive a stake through her heart.  \\"The Contract\\" is a masterpiece of dark fantasy as the angel of death cradles a fallen woman whose time, it seems, has run out.  In \\"The Consummation\\" an Egyptian Princess has embraced her mummified lover right inside his sarcophagus.<br /><br />A female Were-shark is the subject of \\"The Catch\\" as she hangs helpless on a lonely fisherman's wharf.  The masochistic painting entitled \\"The Poet\\" depicts a tortured poet, her walls completely covered by her works that she's nailed there, while her body is covered with scars from a whip that have been self-inflicted.  One can only wonder what kind of game was being played as a demure, white angel lies on the ground, and two arrow shafts piercing her body, in \\"The Game\\".  \\"The Pledge\\" shows a female warrior, kneeling before an altar, chalice in hand.  In a tribute to classic Universal monsters, Dorian presents \\"Chiller\\" with an exotic female mummy in the foreground, and behind the images of the Boris Karloff mummy and Frankenstein's monster, the Lon Chaney Jr. Wolfman, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon.  The book also contains an index giving the title of each piece.<br /><br />Dorian Cleavenger is a true master of dark fantasy and this book is further proof that he remains at the top of his game.lonely fisherman's wharf.

Beaumont mystery, Beau is called upon to investigate a fifty year old murder.  The murder was witnessed by a nun who has only now recalled the incident after years of repressing the memories.  Despite the case being decades old and most of the leads cold and dead, Beau soon learns that there are people in high places that are still covering up this murder all these years later.  Beau was already engaged in investigating the murder of his former partner's (Ron Peters)ex-wife and Peters is the prime suspect.  The two plots run side by side so you basically have two running stories but you never get the sense that Jance was trying to do to much.  Jance handles both plots deftly and the new and old case make for interesting contrasts.<br /><br />I've only read a couple of the Beaumont books but I love jance's chracterization.  I really see these characters as life-like and designed quite well.  On top of that, jance is remarkably skilled at keeping the reader guessing as to who the murderer is.  Fantastic!	2005-08-26

John Romita Jr. has always been my favorite of the new wave of young artists who came up in the late 80's and early 1990's.  While others may have been flashier than he, Romita always had the superior story-telling skills.  Romita knows how to pace a story and didn't have to rely on doing 24 pages of pin-ups.  In \\"The Gray Area\\", John's ability to pace and panel a story is on dramatic display as he's joined by long-time inker Klaus Janson. \\"The Gray Area's\\" plot of redemption isn't especially original but Romita and writer Glen Brunswick work in so many different elements to the story that the reader is kept guessing about how the story will unfold.<br /><br />The story begins as a gritty, NY crime drama as we meet Rudy Chance, a womanizing narcotics cop who is working both sides of the law.  His partner Patty is clean, but he protects Rudy's secrets anyway, knowing at heart he is still a good man.  When Chance crosses a drug lord, his wife and son are killed and Chance is devastated.  Months later he draws his partner in for revenge on the man who killed his family but Chance is double-crossed and is killed while Patty is left in a coma.  But this is only the beginning of the story as Chance soon realizes he's dead and encounters a man named Jordan (and is that a nod to the 1940's film, Here Comes Mr. Jordan?).  Jordan takes chances to the world that is in-between Heaven and Hell.  It is here where most souls go and receive their final chance at redemption in order to move onto Heaven.  Here, greedy real estate salesmen must now help these souls find homes, and so on...<br /><br />Chance is given his opportunity for salvation by joining the Gray Watch, sort of the police force of the realm.  He's first resistant until he finds his alternative is to be sent to the Dark Cloud, there to battle endlessly for all eternity.  Reluctantly he agrees and then begins his training program along with several other recruits where they are given powers and put into a \\"Danger Room\\" type training session.  This is the one part of the book where it stumbles a bit.  What had been a dark, urban fantasy now becomes a bit too \\"super hero styled\\".  Soon the Watch is called on to return to Earth to capture a powerful evil entity that has escaped.  Back on Earth, the Watch can only manifest by possessing the body of someone who was favorable to them in life.  For Chance, this leaves only one possibility, his partner Patty, still lying in a coma in the hospital.  What's more, Chance is warned that exerting too much force from the body will destroy not only that body, but the spirit possessing it as well, dooming it to the Dark Cloud.<br /><br />Glen Brunswisk's story is a mix of crime drama, dark fantasy, horror, and superhero.  As note earlier, the superhero bit comes off as a bit clumsy but at least he didn't put them in costume.  The rest works very well as Romita and Janson turn in another outstanding effort.  Rather than go overboard with their depiction of this twisted, in-between plane of existence, the story and art continues to focus on the character of Chance and his slow, but inevitable conclusion that he wants to be redeemed and wants to see his wife and son again.

It know what it is.  It's not a book written by professional writers but rather written by two people whose profession mirrors that of the characters in the book.  Michael Baden is the Babe Ruth of pathologists whose regualar appearances on HBO's \\"Autopsy\\" as well as various news shows have made him somewhat of a household name.  Linda Kenney is a legal analyst for court TV and they essentially play fictional versions of themselves in this medical thriller.<br /><br />What the pair may lack in effectual writing skills, they make up for in sheer expertise.  Much the way the pair met in real life, their characters of medical examiner Jake Rosen and attorney Philomena Manfreda meet in a morgue over an autopsy.  When Rosen's friend and mentor dies and some mysterious old bones are found the pair embark on a quest to solve the apparent homicides while there are others who try and keep them out of the way.  The twists and turns are not handled all that deftly but the pair's knowledge, particularly Baden's, is on grand display and if you've ever seen him on TV you know how captivating he can be.  Overall a pretty good effort.	2005-08-25

In case that doesn't work there is a very thorough index.<br /><br />The information provided is about as thorough as one could expect with the name of the maker, date, price, size, etc...In addition there is some good reference material noting other Peanuts collectors and clubs.

Why do men have Nipples is a bit on the short side but for what it is, it does a nice job in answering stranged questions to do with one's body.<br /><br />Leyner was asked all sorts of crazy questions when he worked as a cashier in a Rite-Aid years ago, and Dr. Goldberg for year had been pestered about these goofy questions and the two put their heads together to try and answer many of these eternal questions which have plagued mankind...<br /><br />Among the subjects they tackle and shed light on are a detailed explanation of that icky, dry, morning breath and some of the various factors that cause it.  We all know that eating beans can cause a VERY undesired effect in people, but the questions is...Why????  Goldberg relates it's because of the high sugar percentage in the beans that cannot be digested properly which causes gas.  Can you really catch a disease from a toilet seat?  Why do you get brain freeze when you drink something cold too fast?  All these questions and many more are answered in a light, not too technical style, thanks to humorist Leyner.	2005-08-24

The pulps were wll before my time but I've been able to find a number of the paperbacks and also enjoyed the old Eclipse comic series.  I was very excited about this all-new graphic novel, especially because it featured the art of one of my 1970's favorite artists Gene Colan.  The story was in the seemingly capable hands of Don McGregor, another regular Marvel writer from the 70's and 80's.<br /><br />The story starts out well enough as the Spider is investigating a series of brutal murders which have all been inspired by scenes in popular TV shows of the day.  That's right I said TV.  Rather than keep the Spider set in the 1930's, mcGregor elects to set his story in modern times and parody the names of popular TV shows such as \\"The Why Files\\" and \\"Tiffany the<br /><br />Werewolf Killer\\" or some such thing.  The fiend behind the murders is called the Slaughterhouse Skeleton (which IS a name right out of the pulps) and he somehow knows the Spider's true identity.<br /><br />Unfortunately the script really bogs down after a strong opening.  McGregor seemed to have a good idea but just didn't know how to fill it out and thus we get a couple of good bookends but the middle is slow and tedious and lacks the intesity and terror of the pulp stories.  Colan's art is done strictly in pencils and has a gritty, unfinished work that works well with the character, but probably isn't best suited to the more modern setting.	2005-08-23

But I've come to the realization that the $100 to $125 a month i'm spending eating out fast food can be better spent on other things.  Ramen Noodles have stepped up to become a quick, and cheap way to have lunch, especially in a busy office such as the one I work in.  They come in so many flavors now to boot.  I laughed when I saw this book but how can you go wrong for $10?<br /><br />Regular Ramen noodles are just fine by me but Toni patrick puts a charge into them with some amazingly creative additions.  For example, spice up a plain can of tomato soup with some noodles or add some fresh veggies to make a Ramen vegetable soup.  Not all of them will work for your office lunch as some will require baking and a bit of cook time.  I personally love the parmesan Noodles or the Alfredo Noodles which are very quick and easy to make.  Or there is the one person Ramen Lasagna with just a cup of sauce, and some ricotta and mozzarella that can be made in a 4\\" x 4\\" pan.  perfect for a toaster oven if you have one at work.<br /><br />I really can't get into some of the breakfast recipes but perhaps the kids might.  But this book did help spice up lunch a little bit and turn more boring, but cheap Ramen Noodles into something more.	2005-08-23

Even here in the midst of one of the hottest Summer seasons in recent years my thoughts are on bright Christmas lights glittering off the snow outside and the scent of pine and cinnamon inside.  My wife and I have become avid crafters, making things not only for ourselves, but for friends and family as well.  I never ceased to be amazed at the imagination and ingenuity that crafters show in creating items out of simple materials that can often be found right in your own home, or with a quick stop at a local craft store.  My wife has always been big into a traditional country look, especially since we live smack dab in the middle of suburbia.  The Country Living Handmade Christmas book is right up our alley with simple and inexpensive creations that range from the rustic to the elegant.<br /><br />The book starts with simple, basic ideas for decorating your home such as various color schemes and using multiples of items such as small, pre-lit trees, wreaths, candles, plants, garlands, or holiday throw pools.  Candles have become such a staple not only during the holiday season but year round and the lustrous scents of some of these can quickly get you into the holiday mood.  There are a lot of great projects in this book, many which we made last year and are already making for this season.<br /><br />One of the most simple is a Christmas ball tree made with a by gluing small glass Christmas balls to a Styrofoam cone, and then mounting inside a floral vase with some floral foam to help keep it in place.  This is a great way to make use of old glass balls that you may not use on your tree anymore and makes for a great table centerpiece.<br /><br />We collect snowmen and love making new ones.  This book has several different snowmen than can be made very quickly and with items right around the house.  For instance you can use old white tube socks, stuffed with foam, and adorned buttons, scraps of plaid fabric and then a tip of a colored sock for a cap.  Other snowmen can be made from different sized Styrofoam balls, Paper Mache', and felt, all with their own unique looks.  Patterns are included where needed.<br /><br />There are lots of great projects to trim your tree with as well.  A charming, rustic country design is to simply gather some twigs from your yard, and fashion them into the shapes of stars.  Fashion the end points together using red twine or yarn or scraps of plaid fabric in seasonal colors.  It's basically a cost-free decoration that fits the country scheme and always draws compliments from people who note your creativity!<br /><br />An ingenious use of scrap fabric can be found in making Wool garland.  Just cut old scrap wool or felt into 2\\" squares and run a strong thread through them, placing a button here and there and small Christmas bells or balls interspaced every few feet for a delightful accent on a table top tree.  There's also patterns for making your own Christmas stockings out of old material as well.  Now you know why we never throw anything away.  Thrift stores are a great place to find old clothes for cutting up for these projects.<br /><br />More and more people are making their own wrapping paper today and it makes a great change for that truly special gift for someone.  You just need some colored paper which you can get on rolls from craft stores or even office supply stores, and then the paper can be adorned with painted stencil designs, rubber stamps, or sponge-painted.  You can use the same techniques to make your own gift tags.<br /><br />The book is loaded with brilliant, full-color photographs of each project and includes step-by-step instructions and materials list.  You're really only limited by your own imagination.  A truly superb book!<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansons, scraps of plaid fabric and then a tip of a colored sock for a cap.

A charming, rustic country design is to simply gather some twigs from your yard, and fashion them into the shapes of stars.  Fashion the end points together using red twine or yarn or scraps of plaid fabric in seasonal colors.  It's basically a cost-free decoration that fits the country scheme and always draws compliments from people who note your creativity! <br /> <br />An ingenious use of scrap fabric can be found in making Wool garland.  Just cut old scrap wool or felt into 2\\" squares and run a strong thread through them, placing a button here and there and small Christmas bells or balls interspaced every few feet for a delightful accent on a table top tree.  There's also patterns for making your own Christmas stockings out of old material as well.  Now you know why we never throw anything away.  Thrift stores are a great place to find old clothes for cutting up for these projects. <br /> <br />More and more people are making their own wrapping paper today and it makes a great change for that truly special gift for someone.  You just need some colored paper which you can get on rolls from craft stores or even office supply stores, and then the paper can be adorned with painted stencil designs, rubber stamps, or sponge-painted.  You can use the same techniques to make your own gift tags.   <br /> <br />The book is loaded with brilliant, full-color photographs of each project and includes step-by-step instructions and materials list.  You're really only limited by your own imagination.  A truly superb book! <br /> <br />Reviewed by Tim Janson <br />	2005-08-23

Well when you think about Conan, you think Barbarian, of course.  It's an automatic add-on to the name.  In Mongoose's latest supplement for their outstanding Conan RPG, barbarians get their day in the sun, and give rules on players running barbarian, borderer, or nomadic player characters in the Hyborian Age.  As with Mongoose's other Conan supplements the writers and editors show a very strong knowledge of R.E. Howard's Hyborian Age, its countries, and its peoples, which is essential.  Ardent fans would immediately know if the writers had not done their homework on Conan's world.<br /><br />The first part of the book is essentially is an atlas of all of the various nations from Aquilonia to Zingara, describing the types of Barbarian, Borderer, and Nomads that will be found within each nation's borders.  Along the way suggestions for various skills and feats are passed along that are unique to each region, allowing characters to be uniquely tailored by their Hyborian ethnicity.  They also suggest various professions and class combinations that should be used for the character along with appropriate skills, referencing materials in other books such as Conan and the Road of Kings and Conan: The Free Companies.  Kudos to the editors for noting what page in the various supplements the skills referenced can be found.<br /><br />The next part of the book gets into skills and feats.  Anyone familiar with Conan or Robert E. Howard's other characters knows that they were capable of great feats of strength and endurance when pushed to their limits.  The book addresses this with Feats of Might which allow for characters to call upon great reserves to lift very heavy objects, or to throw very heavy objects or to survive in the most dire of situations.  What the Barbarians make lack in finesse and cultural skills, they more than make up for in outdoor skills such as advanced tracking, hunting, fishing, trapping, climbing, and evasiveness skills.  They are also well versed in using what ever terrain they are in to the best of their advantaged and that has also been taken into account with terrain effects in regards to combat.<br /><br />22 new feats are included and are among the most eclectic you will find anywhere.  The battle fury of barbarians is found in feats such as Extreme Might and Wounded Fury.  Owing to their ability to scout their enemy there is a feat called Sense Weakness which gives the character a bonus of +2 to attack and damage rolls.  Besides the feats there are special combat skills that these characters can learn as well such as Mounted Archer Cover where a character can fire his bow while using his mount for cover, and other mounted maneuvers like leaping onto one's mount or leaping upon a mount being ridden by someone else.  The book also provides options for multi-classed characters for Barbarians, Borderers, and Nomads, providing the strengths and weaknesses of each multi-class along with any prerequisite races or skills.<br /><br />The cover art is outstanding (although for some reason the cover that Amazon is showing is not the same as the cover for the book I reviewed.) and the interior art ranges from good to outstanding.  Hyboria's finest answers the need to be able to create barbarian characters that are more than just Cimmerian clones of Conan.  With this well-researched supplement, you can create new and interesting player characters from any Hyborian land from Kush to Hyperborea.

It was an enormous thrill for me to provide a review of \\"The Erotic Elfin Art of Nymphettes\\" by Barry Blair and Colin Walbridge.  Barry and I go way back, almost twenty years.  We've never met, never even spoken by phone, but when I put out my fledgling fanzine \\"Alter Limits\\" back in 1986, Barry's comic company Aircel was one of the most helpful independent comic companies to a young writer, supplying me with review copies, artwork, even paying to advertise in my little zine and I've always appreciated it.  I've been an admirer of his work ever since he first produced his legendary fantasy comic, Elflord.  Influenced by both Wendy Pini and Wally Wood, with a touch of Anime, Blair has carved out a nice little niche for himself and garnered a legion of fans with his comic works over the past two decades.<br /><br />This 48 page over-sized book feature Blair and his partner Colin Walbridge presenting an extraordinary collection of full-color paintings of erotic and sultry Elfin art, all with the wily and spry humor we've come to expect from them.  One thing I love about the book is that the each piece is titled.  I wish this was done more in art collections.  Blair and Walbridge use colors that are as bright and feisty as the characters they illustrate.<br /><br />Dark Elves are popular character in fantasy fiction these days and one of the standout paintings in this collection is \\"Rosehawk\\" featuring a dark elf female, clad in contrasting red leather, holding a sword and ready for battle.  In \\"The Lynx and the Serpent Lagoon\\" a beautiful red-haired elf battles for her life against a monstrous sea-serpent.  Showing off their wry humor is a piece called \\"Now you will tell me\\" depicting an elf buried in sand up to her chest as a female pirate waits for her to spill her secrets.<br /><br />\\"Unexpected Visit\\" is an aptly named painting.  A cute elf is lounging in a refreshing bath when she's suddenly startled by the appearance of an unwanted companion in her bathtub.  And in a nod to playful pin-ups of days gone by, \\"Bad Bianca\\" shows a pretty little elf on the receiving end of a good spanking while several other elves laugh and giggle in the background.  It's a superb collection by one of my favorites from the \\"golden age\\" on independent comics.

These are not Santa's Elves (unless Hugh Hefner took over for Santa), nor are they the elves of popular fantasy fiction.  These are gorgeous elves, pixies, and sprites...bright-eyed, with full pouty lips and bodies to die for.  Inside we have 64 pages of black & white illustrations, some in finished pencils, others in slightly rougher pencil, all featuring sultry, sexy elven vixens as we've never seen them before.  Fersko's art has a very playful edge to it with perhaps a slight Froud influence.  Lush detail and fine line-work is a mark of these pieces as you'll find a number of smaller sprites and such, all fluttering in the background.<br /><br />These are not just everyday Faerie-kind, but Melanie gives us faeries of all types.  Some of my favorite pieces are a wild, barbaric-looking elf, primitive and fierce in animal skins and grasping a spear.  Then there is a gypsy-like, lovely Elven Tarot card reader, revealing the fortunes of an unseen customer.  Another stunning piece is the \\"Devil-elf\\" on page 43, clad in leather and fishnet stockings and sporting bat-like wings, this is true dominatrix!  Continuing with that Dominatrix theme is a piece featuring Santa's latest helper, clad in Santa cap and whip, making sure the rest of the elves keep up on their toy-making.<br /><br />There are also several bondage illustrations in the book:  A stunning nude elf is bound while her captors delight in her helplessness; Another elf has her hands tied behind her back and on her knees;  And one more bondage piece features a bound & gagged elf about to be given away as a gift.  The bondage pieces are not harsh, in fact their sauciness reminds me more of old 30's and 40's pin-ups.  One can surmise that male elves have these folded up in their wallets for inspiration as they go out to battle the Orc hordes!<br /><br />Fersko takes a popular fantasy convention and tosses them into a new and sexy light!<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonion and tosses them into a new and sexy light!   <br /> <br />Reviewed by Tim Janson <br />	2005-08-22

The stories are short, just four or five pages in length, and much of the story relates the history of the area or people involved.  Some of the other reviewers have been a bit critical of this fact but I rather like the quaint charm in which author Carol Olivieri Schulte relates these various tales.  They are perhaps more along the lines of legends than they are scary, but again I think that goes to the allure of the book and its rough, yet pastoral setting.<br /><br />This blueprint is perfectly illustrated in the story of \\"The Haunted Mountain\\", which tells the take of 13 year-old Sarah Whitesell who was picnicking on the mountain in 1865 with her family when she fell to her death.  A wooden cross was erected in her memory on the mountain and since then, people have reported seeing a phantom girl playing in the flowers on Spring or Summer days.<br /><br />\\"Burnt Head\\" tells the tale of young woman named Cathy who was walking the trail to Burnt Head along the cliffs when she suddenly felt hands on her back, slowly pushing her towards the edge of the cliff, stopping just three feet from where a fall would have been certain death.  While researching the history in town, Cathy discovers that an elderly woman committed suicide by jumping from that very spot several years earlier.<br /><br />In \\"Pitcher Man\\" we learn about a Maine Revolutionary War hero William Richardson.  Richardson was enjoying a victory celebration when he wandered from the group of revelers, pitcher of beer in hand, and was killed by Torrie loyalists near a bridge.  Years later the spot would become a kind of local lover's lane with many teens encountering a phantom, merrily carrying a pitcher before disappearing.<br /><br />Perhaps the most chilling tale, certainly the most tragic was that of \\"The Invisible Estate\\".  When a fire rips through a beautiful mansion it claims the life of three children and their two elderly babysitters, completely destroying the home, and leaving only a great stone chimney standing. The spot was never built over and the chimney was left where it stood.  Many residents have related hearing the terrified screams of children coming from the spot and when one photographer took a picture of the chimney, he was shocked to see the complete mansion in the photograph.<br /><br />The \\"Cursed Farm\\", \\"Massacre Pond\\", \\"Witches Grave\\", and \\"Musical Mystery House\\" are just a few more of the tales you'll read in this short, but captivating book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansone of three children and their two elderly babysitters, completely destroying the home, and leaving only a great stone chimney standing.

In this campaign (and you can read my review of it for more details) the Dark Lord Izrador has ruled the lands of Eredane for 100 years with an iron fist.  To keep the people in control, he has made it illegal to carry weapons except for his own forces.  But many brave heroes have taken up the banner to battle the dark lord and this supplement is geared towards making fighters tough enough to stand up to the tide of evil they face.<br /><br />The first chapter deals with racial templates and creating characters from the various races of Eredane who have specialized skills to survive and wage war in this harsh world.  For example, Dwarven barbarians will lose the Ride & Swim skills but gain the new skills of Escape Artist and Knowledge.  Each of the various races have their unique skills especially tailored to the Midnight setting.  There are nine new feats included, most of which are called Initiate Feats.  These Initiate Feats allow the character to learn a number of different cultural fighting techniques which again, are unique to each race.  For example, Elven characters can learn fighting techniques such as the ability to fire their arrows accurately through dense forest, or firing their bow while climbing or from tree tops.  Halflings can learn to use their speed and dexterity to dodge and weave in battle, giving them a bonus to their AC.  Orcs can learn fighting techniques such as Iron-Handed Grappling and Quick Charge.  Each race has about a half-dozen cultural fighting techniques that they can learn.  Races have always had their own special modifiers to attributes and abilities, but the inclusion of fighting skills based on race is a welcome and distinctive inspiration.  Steel & Shadow also includes several new heroic paths the player can follow, each providing a new skill/ability or increased skill at each level.<br /><br />There are ten new and well-designed prestige classes to choose from.  You know YOU'VE been waiting to hear about the prestige classes.  Rather than being some bland, generic classes with abilities that seem randomly tossed in, these prestige classes are crafted to fit the Midnight campaign, taking into account the cultural heritage and abilities of the various peoples.  The Banishers are a class that specializes in hunting down and taking vengeance upon evil, especially demons and their ilk and they gain special bonuses in combat against these types of monsters.  The Durgis Battle Rager is a fearsome fighter with a d12 hit die, who can channel his rage into a frightening fury of destruction who has skills like Whirlwind Charge and Mindless Rage which gives additional attack and defense bonuses.  Halflings and Gnomes are the races that have suffered perhaps the most under Izrador.  The prestige class Quickjack, is made for these small, nimble characters to best take advantage of their size in battle.  They gain abilities like Elusive, Evasion, and Close Fighting to even the odds with large foes.<br /><br />The supplement also includes information on regional terrain and how the races indigenous to those regions can exploit the terrain to their benefit.  Several examples of sample terrains are included to assist the DM and player alike.  There are some that may argue that the various abilities, feats, skills, and prestige classes in this book will create overly powerful characters.  And in a standard campaign they may be right.  But Midnight's campaign already puts the characters up against overwhelming odds that these powers are not only helpful, but I would argue even necessary, in order to survive.  As with Fantasy Flights other Midnight items the book is well-written and designed.  Outstanding interior artwork perfectly complements the material.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansone classes to choose from.  You know YOU'VE been waiting to hear about the prestige classes.

It's as simple as that.  It's not meant to educate long-time players although I did benefit from it for one major reason which I will explain later.  The book opens with a short history of the D&D game from its creation by Gary Gygax, born out of war gaming with miniatures.  I played for the first time back in 1979 shortly after the introduction of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game and the publication of the First DM's Guide, Player's Handbook, and Monster Manual by TSR.<br /><br />The book first covers the basics of just what a role-playing game is.  Some veteran gamers are taking offense at this but not EVERYONE knows what a role-playing game is and how they are played.  It's hard to explain a game that doesn't really end and where there isn't a traditional winner as in most games.  It's a concept that must be experienced to be fully understood.  The Authors explain first in brief, and later in great detail the concepts of character creation, race & class selection, alignment, weapons, spells, etc...Several examples of fully created characters are included.  Later full chapters are dedicated to all of these different subjects.  While it's true that trial and error was always a pitfall, and sometimes a humorous pitfall for new players, this book essentially seeks to educate new players to create the best player they can, rather than one who foolishly selects a pole axe for his main weapon and then wondering why he can't use it in the tight confines of the dungeon.<br /><br />Now I mentioned earlier how veteran gamers might benefit from the books as well as novices.  I had left the gaming world for a number of years and only recently have returned to the fold.  Dungeons & Dragons has changed a great deal in these past several years.  From what was once a game consisting of three main books is now a game with dozens of books, supplements and accessories covering every facet of play.  There were new concepts in the game that were foreign to me such as skills, feats, and prestige classes.  Now of course I've since learned about all these new additions but I'm sure there are others out there just like me and this book would be a great help to get them caught up on all the changes in the game.  In particular the section on prestige classes was very good and featured explanations of all the different prestige classes and their benefits.<br /><br />But even beyond that the book provides very helpful information that even the most experienced gamers can find useful.  Tips such as battle strategies and teamwork.  Clerics and Sorcerers working together with their spells, flanking strategies for fighters and other interesting tips.  But it's not just a players book, it also contains good information for the DM on running a successful game and keeping the players happy (as I recall, lots of Doritos and Beer was always helpful).<br /><br />Everything is about lists today, there are entire TV shows dedicated to the Top 100 of this or the Top 10 of that.  Dungeons & Dragons for Dummies has their own lists, too, such as the Top 10 Sorceror/Cleric spells, Top 10 low & Mid level monsters, Top 10 D & D resources, and the Top 10 D & D novels.<br /><br />It's well-written and accurate.  While clearly designed for novices, even experienced gamers will find some things of interest.  Veteran players should not be so snobbish about this book.  The introduction of new blood is always a good thing.th dozens of books, supplements and accessories covering every facet of play.

Add to that I've only read a few Koontz books in my lifetime and I went into this book with a lot of skepticism.  In this re-imagining of the Mary Shelly works, the Frankenstein Monster, called Deucalion, has survived and is leading a quiet life in a Tibetan Monsastery.  He's secreted away from the rest of the world, safe and sound.  He then learns, however, that his creater Victor Frankenstein is alive and well, and living in New Orleans, mad as ever.<br /><br />Frankenstein is now a rich Tycoon, and is up to his old tricks of creating life, and hell-bent on replacing mankind with his laboratory spawned creations.  Unlike the Lighting created patchwork of corpses, these new creatures have been created with the latest technology and been essentially grown in the lab, and designed to be perfect.  When one of these \\"perfect\\" creations escapes and becomes a serial killer, Deucalion will actually join forces with a couple of cops to hunt down the creature and Frankenstein.<br /><br />This is an interesting and intriguing take on the Frankenstein mythology.  It's not Karloff and James Whale to be sure.  The original monster owes much more to the original Shelly story.  This monster is intelligent and thoughful and it is his creator who is the true monster.  The characterizations of the monster and Freankenstein are well done and interesting.  I thought it was perhaps a bit overlong and bogged down in some spots but overall I enjoyed the book.	2005-08-17

The John Romita Sketchbook is another in the outstanding series of interview/sketchbooks from J. David Spurlock's Vanguard Productions.  With all due respect for Steve Ditko, it is the Romita Spiderman that I most fondly recall.  Perhaps it's because it's the one I grew up on or perhaps it's because I liked Romita's more modern look.  Whatever the case, John has always been the artist I most associate with the webcrawler.<br /><br />John begins by discussing his early career as an illustrator as well as his education and influences such as Roy Crane, Hal Foster, Noel Nickles and Alex Toth.  The one revelation that I've had in reading many of these sketchbooks from Vanguard was that so many of these artists had been working in comics since the golden age.  I just assumed that Romita was a young guy when he took over Spiderman because his art was so dynamic and so modern looking.  I was surprised to find out that his career in comics started in the late 1940's doing ghost work on crime comics.  John moved to DC in the 1950's where he was inking Mike Sekowsky's work on various romance titles and learning everything he could from Carmine Infantino.  It was interesting to hear Romita discuss the DC art style of that period.  They wanted everything to look uniform and generic.  One wonders how good these artists could have been had they been afforded the opportunity to express their own unique art styles the way artists at Marvel were able to do.<br /><br />John would get laid off at DC and was immediately hired by Stan Lee, who Romita considered a great editor.  John lets fans in on a secret about how Marvel constantly recycled plots, changing names, etc, to churn material out at a faster pace.  He covers, although a bit too briefly, taking over first for Wally Wood on Daredevil and then Ditko on Spiderman.  Later, Romita relates how Jack Kirby had wanted John to go with him to DC when he left in the early 70's.  John was flattered but remained at Marvel.  Kirby himself would return just a few years later.  Perhaps my favorite part of the interview was Romita discussing how books were plotted and taking the reader through several sample pages of panel art and explaining the hows and whys of comic art technique.<br /><br />Throughout the book we are treated to hundreds of wonderful illustrations including those beautiful Romita women and their trademark dimples.  John is an engrossing talent and confers his vast experience of the comic book business to the reader.  A thorough, and thoroughly enjoyable interview.

Tailgating has gone from a simple pre-game meal of hamburgers and dogs to a full-blown ritual, lasting hours, involving dozens, and featuring elaborate full course meals.  In fact, it's well known that many people who go to Michigan Football games don't have tickets and go just to tailgate and watch the game on TV!  It's truly incredible to see these people with the RV's and a spread that would make any caterer jealous.  The Tailgating Cookbook is part BBQ cookbook and part event planner.<br /><br />The brief introduction covers Tailgating basics such as equipment, preparation, food storage, etc, before getting into the meat of the book, no pun intended on appetizers.  Now I love a good appetizer and hot wings can be a meal to me.  The book provides a great buffalo wing recipe where the wings can be grilled.  There are also recipes for tailgate party staples such as Salsas, Guacamole dip, deviled eggs, shrimp cocktail, and more.  After the appetizers comes the main courses and the book is divided into sections on Beef, pork, chicken, fish, vegetables, Burgers and Brats, Chili, side dishes, desserts, and drinks.  There's also specific menus for special events like Thanksgiving, and the Fourth of July.<br /><br />The author takes into account that this is a tailgate and some recipes have to be prepped in advanced either in the morning or the night before, or the recipes are things that can be made quickly and with a minimum number of ingredients.  The Potato salad with Bacon is a great make ahead dish and the bacon really gives it some flair over everyday potato salad.  The Lambeau field or more accurately Wisconsin-style Brats are always a great favorite for game day. And can be grilled or boiled.  The Hawaiian style chicken kabobs are also great and very easy to make.  An excellent food that can even be made on a small hibachi if that's all you have and you're not feeding many.  Everyone has their own favorites for tailgating but Bob Sloan has some mighty good recipes here as well as some practical tips on making a good tailgate party.od recipes here as well as some practical tips on making a good tailgate party. <br />	2005-08-16

In my family room hangs a Print by Rosa autographed to me and my family.  I've met and spoken to him several times at local comic book shows.  He is just a fantastic gentleman.  So to say I was a bit excited about this collection is an understatement.  People may say it's just Disney art but true fans know the differences between Rosa, Barks, and other famous Disney artists.  This collects the 12 volumes originally published by Gladstone and now put out by Gemstone).  The story traces Scrooge McDucks life from the very beginning to coming to America and amassing his fortune to become the world's richest duck.<br /><br />The book reprints issues 285 to 296 of Uncle Scrooge comics.  The story opens in Scotland where we learn the history of Clan McDuck who've lost their fortune and been run out of their ancestral castle by the Whiskervilles and their hoax of a devil hound that haunts the castle grounds.  We meet little Scrooge McDuck and his family as they struggle to make ends meet as Scrooge is determined to make his fortune one day.  He earns his first dime shining shoes and then sails off to America in search of riches.<br /><br />In his first American adventure he meets uncle Angle McDuck and helps him to recover some sunken gold bars in the Mississippi only to lose it to the dastardly Beagle Gang.  Over the next several issues Scooge's globe-trotting adventures take him to the wild west, Africa, Australia, and back to Scotland where he has to help save the McDuck castle when his family falls behind on their taxes and the Whiskervilles threaten to take over.  Eventually Scooge would travel to the Yukon territory where he would first strike it rich with the discovery of a solid gold egg.  From there Scrooge would establish the town of Duckburg and we get to see his first ever meetings with his nephew Donald, and his great nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie.<br /><br />As great as the stories are, perhaps even better is the commentary by Rosa after each story.  Don explains the genesis of each issue and how he built upon stories that Barks had wrote and added to them to create the rich history of Scrooge and his family.  We also get to see rare overseas editions of Disney comic covers and how they varied from their American counterparts.  Don's admiration for Carl Barks is evident in his hiding of the word \\"duck\\" in every cover and splash page so readers get to spend hours looking to find the hidden tributes.<br /><br />There's just nothing bad to say about this book.  It looks fabulous; the colors are crisp and bright and just leap off the page.  It's funny, it's exciting, and it's well-edited and done right.  Thank you Gemstone for taking care of your fans!<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim JansonDon explains the genesis of each issue and how he built upon stories that Barks had wrote and added to them to create the rich history of Scrooge and his family.

Much like Christmas Halloween has become an entire season with stores dedicated to selling Halloween items popping up every year around the beginning of September and people decorating their homes at the beginning of October.  If anything, Halloween may be even more elaborate and more expensive with complex animated items and realistic tombstones and other such displays.  And the costumes...one can spend upwards of a hundred dollars or more on a good costume. That's where this wonderful book by Joanne O'Sullivan comes in handy.  The book concentrates mainly on costumes and accessories, showing you step-by-step how you can make some fantastic costumes at home, often with materials you may already have or that can be purchased inexpensively at fabric or hardware stores.<br /><br />Each costume comes with a full color photograph and each has a well done materials list and directions which clearly illustrate how to make the costume.  Now if you're slant is to the ghoulish and gory, this won't be the book for you.  The costumes here slant towards the traditional such as a gladiator, Knight, and Witch, to the rather sublime such as dressing as a Jackson Pollock abstract painting.  The designs all show marvelous creativity and shows what you can do with a little imagination.  How about making an English Judge's wig out of rolls of bathroom tissue, or a Geisha Girl costume made with old bed sheets.  The costumes are all aimed at adults and the materials list reflects making these for an adult wearer, as opposed to children.<br /><br />There's a nice section on creating medieval weaponry on stuff cheaply found at a hardware or home improvement store.  One of my favorite items in the book was a Medusa's wig that looks just spectacular.  Get yourself some cheap rubber snakes from the local dollar store, a swim cap, and a few other ingredients and you've got a very unique and terrifying accessory to a costume or outdoor display.  There are also a variety of other wigs, capes, hands, and feet that can be made.  The decorating section is a bit sparse but contains some nice information on pumpkin carving, decorating alternatives, and making such items as voodoo and hex dolls.<br /><br />Finally, there is some great tips on throwing themed Halloween parties such as a New Orleans Voodoo Cocktail party or a Day of the Dead dinner party, both with invitations, d&eacute;cor, libations and food, all matching the theme. While it may be a tame for some peoples tastes, \\"Halloween: A Grown-Up's Guide to Creative Costumes, Devilish Decor & Fabulous Festivities\\" is still a great book with many interesting and imaginative ideas.

Fighting Guidance was one of the more interesting Manga that I've read in a long time.  There were no great kung-fu battles, no robots, sorcerers, dragons...nothing spectacular of any kind really, just an enjoyable story.  The setting is the Korean high school system and the editors provide a nice explanation to readers about the structure of the Korean school systems and its hierarchy of gangs.  This was all needed to understand the story to its fullest effect.  We learn that the gangs and schools themselves operate with a unique social order with each grade or class year having its own gang boss who seems to directly report or be responsible to the boss in the class above him.  It is into this setting that Ghi Han Shin arrives.  The new guy in school with the quick wit and faster mouth that gets him in trouble at every turn.<br /><br />He meets Hyun Ha Ghang, another first year student and a member of the Guidance Club.  The Guidance club are basically student officers who are concerned with the well-being of all the kids in their grade level.  Hyun Ha isn't too crazy about his new guy in school, Ghi Han.  He can't believe he had the grades to gain entry into this elite school and furthermore Ghi Han pulled down Hyun's pants when he didn't believe that the cute boy was actually a boy!  Ghi Han soon finds himself in conflict with the first year class boss Young Woo.  Hyun shows off his own fighting skills by rescuing Woo and warning him to stay away from the new guy.  Ghi Han it seems is not a fighter.  But whenYoung Woo and his gang ambush Hyun Ha, Ghi Han becomes a whirlwind of fury, dispatching the gang with ease and amazing Hyun Ha.  A tattoo on Ghi's arm identifies him as a member of the elite Union Five High Class.  Were not told directly what the Union Five is, but from the various reactions, we know that Ghi Han is no one to be messed with.<br /><br />Soon members of the gang as well as the high ranking members of the guidance club begin to check out this new guy and to try and figure out who he really is.  We know from Ghi himself that he came from an environment where there were fights constantly and he wanted to escape that life.  But why is such an elite fighter merely a first year student?  Fighting Guidance is an enjoyable action drama, sprinkled liberally with humor, mainly as Ghi makes Hyun Ha the butt of his jokes constantly.  The unique caste structure of the Korean schools was interesting to read about.  The art is pretty standard manga-style, very proficient but nothing out of the ordinary.

Writer Jason Paul Collum interviews 20 of these women in his new book \\"Assault of the Killer B's\\" and also gets us caught up with what these women are up to today.  The first interview is with Judith O'Dea who played the doomed Barbara in the original \\"Night of the Living Dead\\".  O'Dea probably doesn't fit the mold of a scream queen and certainly doesn't see herself that way, but the importance of this film is not lost on her or the fans of the horror genre.  O'Dea talks about working for George Romero and John Russo's production company in Pittsburgh in the 1960's, doing voice over work for documentaries and how this film came to be.  She relates that much of the dialog was ad-libbed such as when she tells Ben what happened to her and her brother Johnny.  She also admits to being truly terrified in the scene where she is dragged out of the house by a horde of zombies.<br /><br />The largest section of the book features the girls of the Slumber Party Massacre series of films.  It would seem that this was the most expansive section due to the fact that so many of these women were available for interviews, unlike some of the other horror franchises.  Among those featured are Debra DeLiso, Heidi Kozak, Brandi Burkett, and one of the greatest of all Scream Queens, Brinke Stevens.  They all share their thoughts on doing these films as well as the other horror films they've been in.<br /><br />Collum relates his frustration in trying first to track down and then get interviews with many of the actresses who starred in the Friday the 13th films.  Many simply could not be located and many that were flat-out refused to be interviewed.  It seems that many, including Adrienne King from the first film had their problems with stalkers and obsessed fans and as a result they've tried to distance themselves from these movies.  Collum did manage to land Lar Park Lincoln who played the psychic Tina in Friday the 13th part 7 The new Blood.  Lincoln, too, had her problems with a stalker but after many years away has recently made a return to film in bit roles.  Also interviewed is Kari Keegan from \\"Jason Goes to Hell:  The Final Friday\\"<br /><br />Stars from Nightmare on Elm Street are also featured including Lisa Wilcox who starred in parts 4 & 5, and Lisa Zane who played Freddy Kruegers daughter Maggie in what was supposed to have been the final film in the series, \\"Freddy's Dead:  The Final Nightmare\\".<br /><br />One of the more enjoyable interviews Collum conducted was with Pamela Susan Shoop of Halloween II.  Shoop's long list of TV credits include:  Mannix, Night Gallery, The Mod Squad, Wonder Woman, The Incredible Hulk, CHiPs, Knight Rider, Murder She Wrote, and many others.  But horror fans will always remember her as the beautiful Nurse Karen in Halloween II, who was perhaps the most famous victim of Michael Myers as she was strangled in the hospital hot tub.  Shoop relates how she got an ear infection due to the water being so cold in the \\"hot tub\\".<br /><br />Collum also interviews Cassandra Peterson, AKA Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, the women from the Sleepaway Camp Series, and several more.  Collum's book is well-researched and the interviews very conversational in tone.  There were some notable omissions from the book such as perhaps the two most well-known scream queens Linnea Quigley and Julie Strain, but all in all, Collum did a great job in tracking down the actresses who played in these now legendary cult films.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonmanage to land Lar Park Lincoln who played the psychic Tina in Friday the 13th part 7 The new Blood.

Mank gives the women their due.  What would a horror film be without a beautiful heroine to terrorize, or to become the monster herself?  Mank spotlights the actresses who would co-star in some of the greatest horror films in history:  Dracula, Frankenstein, The Invisible Man, The Old Dark House, The Black Cat, Bride of Frankenstein, Freaks, King Kong, and many more.  Mank personally interviewed many of these women before their passing to get their thoughts and unique insight on these famous films.  The women are presented in chronological order of the release date of the film they are most well known for.<br /><br />First up is Helen Chandler, the beautiful Mina and object of Bela Lugosi's desire in Dracula.  Chandler would unfortunately be badly burned in a fire in the 1950's and become a recluse.  She would pass away in the mid-1960s in obscurity.  Her cremated ashes would go unclaimed from a chapel storage vault in Los Angeles.<br /><br />Mae Clarke provided 1930's audiences with one of the most terrifying scenes in history, playing Elizabeth, the fianc&eacute;e to Dr. Frankenstein.  As she is getting ready for her wedding, the monster attacks her in her room.  It's still a powerful scene over seventy years later.<br /><br />One of the most interesting interviews and chapters features Marilyn Harris.  Harris played the little girl who is inadvertently drowned by the Frankenstein Monster.  She relates how Karloff tried to lead a bit of a revolt to get James Whale to change the scene and not kill the girl.  This scene would be cut from the film for decades after.  Whale would take revenge on the rebellious Karloff by making him do several retakes of the scene where he has to carry Colin Clive up the windmill stairs, thus injury Karloff's back.  Harris goes on to relate her own life story of growing up as an adopted child of mother who cruelly abused her and only wanted her to be a movie star due to her own failed attempts at stardom.<br /><br />Gloria Stewart talks about the making of \\"The Old Dark House\\" which would create its own sub-genre of horror films in the 30's and 40's.  Boasting a cast of Karloff, Ernest Thesiger, Melvyn Douglas and Charles Laughton, Stewart talks about working with the great James Whale and the famous scene where she is accosted by the mute, beast-like butler Morgan (Karloff).<br /><br />Fay Wray has to be considered the very first scream queen.  While most of these women starred in only one or two horror films, Wray starred in four between 1932 & 1933 with \\"Doctor X\\", \\"Mystery of the Wax Museum\\", \\"The Vampire Bat\\" and, of course, \\"King Kong\\".  I would be disillusioned to find out that Wray's lovely, golden blonde hair in King Kong was a wig and that her trademark scream may have actually been voiced by another actress.<br /><br />Zita Johann provides interesting insight into the 1932 classic, \\"The Mummy\\" including her battles with director Karl Freund who had her enter a cage of lions unprotected in the Christian reincarnation scene, while he was safe in a cage.  As with every woman interviewed, she speaks quite highly of Karloff as a polite gentleman.<br /><br />Lucille Lund had even worse problems with a director on the set of one of my favorite horror films \\"The Black Cat\\".  After she spurned the advances of director Edgar G. Ulmer, he proceeded to make her life a living hell.  In a scene where she is to portray her dead mother inside a glass coffin, she is left hanging for over an hour while the rest of the crew goes to lunch, somewhat fitting when one considers the cruel, nihilistic tone of this film.<br /><br />One of my favorite actresses to read about was Carroll Borland who created one of the most indelible characters of the 1930's as Luna in \\"Mark of the Vampire\\".  Her long flowing hair, pale white face and dark eyes would be the inspiration for women such as Vampira and Elvira.  Borland, obsessed with Lugosi as a young girl, met the star at the age of 15.  Just out of high school she tried out for the role of Luna and only got it when she paid director Tod Browning $150.00!<br /><br />In addition to these actresses Mank also has chapters on Elsa Lanchester, Valerie Hobson (Bride of Frankenstein), Gloria Holden (Dracula's Daughter), Sideny Fox (Murders in the Rue Morgue) and many more.  The enthusiasm that Mank has for his subjects is evident as many of these interviews were conducted years before the publication of this book when Mank was still more fan than professional writer and film historian.  Photographs from these classic films are included as well as number of photos taken at the time the interviews were conducted.<br /><br />It's a marvelous book that pays tribute to many of the women who did their parts to make these films live on for decades.  One of the best books on classic horror that I have ever read!  Another example of why McFarland Publishing is one of the most dynamic publishers around today.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonwhite face and dark eyes would be the inspiration for women such as Vampira and Elvira.

Battles of this type were always a bit secondary to the adventures of the player characters.  Sure, you may take place in a large scale battle but the outcome was generally decided by the DM.  Still if you crave a rule for everything I supposed you could do much worse than this latest WOC supplement.<br /><br />This supplement for the DM puts the PC's in the midst of these battles and shows the DM how to determine the outcome...soft of...Ultimately the DM will have to decide who is to win the battle.  Chapters included are:<br /><br />The War Campaign which provides a general background on running large scale battles and their primary differences over standard dungeon warfare, as well as the pacing and flow of battles of these types, again over the everyday hack-n-slash adventure.<br /><br />In Chapter two on Building Adventures, the book instructs the DM on constructing a battle including developing timelines and flowcharts and working out how the various PCs can affect the outcome of a battle, if at all.  It also presents terrain factors as well and amounts to somewhat of a board war game in its scope.  This is all a bit more complicated than most DMs are used to.  Chapter 3 on Battle Field encounters provides sample encounters complete with maps.  Ok but not terribly exciting.<br /><br />Chapter Four's \\"Rules of War\\" really gets down to the nuts and bolts of running battles taking into account large scale attacks from archers, siege engines, etc.  Also covered is the aura of the field commanders.  Like any great military leader, commanders with strong auras can affect and help their troops in battle or rally them to victory.  This is a pretty nice touch.  Commanders can even earn points to gain promotions.<br /><br />Chapter five \\"The military character\\" will probably be the most popular chapter as it contains new feats and new prestige classes such as the Dread Commando, legendary leader, and War Weaver which is a new type of combat mage.  The final chapter deals with the use of magic in war including new spells and new magic items.<br /><br />As with most WOC products the book is well written and illustrated.  The index and appendices are well done.  But this again falls under the banner of overkill to me.  It seems WOC wants to have a supplement for virtually every situation, every type of terrain or area you could ever possibly encounter.  Jeez does anyone remember when all you needed was a Monster manual, Players Handbook, DM's Guide and a little imagination?contains new feats and new prestige classes such as the Dread Commando, legendary leader, and War Weaver which is a new type of combat mage.

Still, that doesn't stop many companies from trying to do just that, resulting in a telephone book-sized tome with tiny print to match for the literally thousands of listings inside.  This of course means very little room for pictures.  Thankfully in Charles Dee Sharp's book \\"The Wonder of American Toys\\" there is no pretense of trying to put out a comprehensive guide.  Rather that we have is a celebration of toys from the golden age of the 1920's through the 1950's and an eclectic collection of toys accompanied by brilliant, full-color photography.  While Sharp does give a price range on all of the toys contained in this 336 page hardcover, it isn't meant to display the rarest or most collectible toys.  Rather this is a sampling of the types and styles of toys produced during this era, regardless of value.  The price ranges go from under $100 in price up to thousands of dollars.<br /><br />The book is sectioned in chapters on types of toys such as Farm Toys, City Toys, Planes, Trains, Musical toys, Character toys, and more.  There's tin toys, cast-iron toys, wooden toys and paper toys.  Nearly color photographs display every toy covered in the book.  Women may be upset that dolls and girl toys in general get a bit short-changed.  There are some things such as a Mickey Mouse washing machine and tea set from the 1930's  and character toys like Little Orphan Annie, but the book mainly concentrates on boy toys.  It's filled with classic vehicle toys made by companies like Buddy L, Tootsie, Wyandotte, and Marx.  There's Coca Cola Delivery trucks, buses, cabs, coupes, and everything in between.  There's even all manner of ships and boats including powerboats featuring the legendary speed boat racer Gar Wood.<br /><br />Collectors will especially enjoy the section on character toys of early film, radio and animation like Charlie McCarthy, Popeye, Felix the Cat and Betty Boop.  Westerns are well represented with a myriad of toy guns including the ubiquitous Red Ryder rifle.  Sharp hits just about every are he can including Circus toys, sports, war toys, and construction toys like Lincoln Logs and Tinker Toys.  My only complaint is that the section on space and futuristic toys is pretty sparse.  Admittedly those are a favorite of mine and given how highly collectible these items are I would have liked to have seen a bit more.  Even if you are maybe too young to remember these toys (like me) you'll still enjoy thumbing through the pages and seeing the things that your parents or grand parents played with when they were children.

After more than fifteen years, gamers in the Forgotten Realms campaign are finally getting a new and updated version of the campaign's most famous and notorious city, Waterdeep.  The Forgotten Realms has always been my favorite campaign to adventure in and run.  It is supported by dozens of supplements as well as dozens of novels set within the realms.  No campaign the kind of source material that the Forgotten Realms can.  In this new, 160 page hardcover by Eric Boyd, the City of Splendors gets a makeover to update it to the current system and provide greater depth and detail than the original supplement.<br /><br />Boyd provides a thorough history of the city and provides background information on major characters, rulers, laws, trade and much more.  There are literally hundreds of organizations and guilds operating within the city, and many of them are outline in the book which includes the guild type, alignments of members, dues, salary, class requirements, and leadership.  The same elements are also provided for all of the various churches and temples found within Waterdeep.  Then there are a wide array of ruffian and rogue gangs such as the Black Boar Tribe, a group of fighters and barbarians who run protection rackets in the Dock Ward and the Shadow Thieves who were banded long ago but are now re-emerging as a threat.  In addition, Boyd provides information on noble houses that includes their histories, key members, and plots and intrigues which can be starting points for adventures for player characters.<br /><br />Four new prestige classes are included and unique to Waterdeep:  The Knights of the Blue Moon, Moonstar Agents, Sun Soul Monks, and the Gray Hand Enforcers.  The latter is the most intriguing, being they are basically the shock troops of the Lords of Waterdeep.  Enormously powerful, non-evil aligned fighters who gain attack bonuses and resistance to damage and spells.  People tend to get out of the way of these guys as they have a reputation for causing a great deal of collateral damage when dealing with a threat.<br /><br />Boyd covers each of the 6 main districts of Waterdeep which are referred to as \\"wards\\".  Each ward has a corresponding map and legend which details some of the more important buildings to be found but much is left for the DM to fill in as he or she best sees fit.  Each of the buildings has a class rating which designates it's size and scope.  Besides the main 6 wards information is provided on the notorious haven for smugglers known as Skullport.<br /><br />While Waterdeep works as a great city it also works as a great dungeon as there are many different dungeons that  can be explored from inside of the city including the Dungeons of the Crpyt built by the vampire Artor Morlin, The Cliff Watch Ruins, Citadel of the Bloody Hand, and many more.  The Sewers of Waterdeep are vast and connect many of these dungeons and crypts and a full map of the sewers is included.  Along with the noting the tunnels which connect to these other areas, a random encounter table is available to the DM.  The most famous dungeon in Waterdeep and in all the Forgotten Realms can be found here, too.  The Ruins of Undermountain were covered exhaustively more than ten years ago with two outstanding boxed sets.  Hopefully WOC will do an update on that as well but if not, try and find those on the secondary market.  Boyd does give some details on the Underhalls but refers to these products as the primary source or for the DM to create his own dungeon if these cannot be located.<br /><br />The Waterdeep sourcebook features 9 new monsters, a half dozen new feats, over three dozen new magic items including new artifacts, and a couple of dozen new spells.  The full color illustrations throughout the book are all uniformly good and it's the kind of quality book you expect from Wizards of the Coast.  My only complaint is that I wish they had included a fold out map of Waterdeep.  The Maps of the various wards are all on separate pages and kind of small.  A pull-out map would have been a great extra perk.  As it is Waterdeep is a great update on a classic Forgotten Realms city.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonare all on separate pages and kind of small.

His art was always consistently good without trying to be overpowering the way so many artists are today.  \\"Drawing Monsters and Heroes for Film & Comics\\" presents a wonderful cross-section of Gamill's work throughout his career, both pre and post-comic book days.  Gammill's early life was not unlike my own...except for the being a talented artist part.  He was a big fan of classic monsters, horror movie hosts, silver age art, and those great old monster model kits by Aurora.<br /><br />Gammill discusses how he eventually broke into comics with Marvel and gives aspiring artists some great advice on how to do the same.  As he points out, back when he broke in there weren't many publishers like there are today and if you wanted to draw superheroes you had to work for Marvel or DC.  The playing field has changed and there are many more outlets available to artists today but Gammill still recommends that putting together a great portfolio not only of pinup type pages, but also examples showing how to flow a story and action.  He also recommends getting to know the human anatomy.  As a long time comic fan I could not agree more.  There are many talented artists in comics today but the best are those that can tell a story, not just draw splash pages.  Dozens of examples of Kerry's work from his comic days are on display including many pieces that were never used.  Gammill again emphasizes the need for artists to study anatomy and facial expressions which are especially critical when drawing characters from a particular perspective.<br /><br />Gammill abruptly left comics and began doing conceptual work in a number of different areas.  He provided concept drawings to a toy company who made premium items for fast food meals.  A number of these drawings are included in the book and feature things like R2D2 band-aid dispensers, and Darth Maul mouse pads.  Lunch boxes, tooth brushes, model kits...Gammill provided the concept art for dozens of different products.  And you never would have known that one of our favorite comic book artists was partly responsible for the design of Taco Bell kids meal toy!<br /><br />Gammill would go on to do concept drawings for film and TV and work on projects such as \\"Virus\\" starring Jamie Lee Curtis and the new Outer Limits television show.  We get to see drawings he did for the shelved \\"I am Legend\\" film that was to star Arnold Schwarzenegger was and based on the story by Richard Matheson.  Another project that Gammill worked on that has since been scrapped was the \\"Superman Lives\\" film that has since been replaced by \\"Superman Returns\\".  These drawings show off his vision of Superman's adversary `Doomsday' who has a very different look than the comic book version.<br /><br />Gammill's very diversified career is given a bright spotlight by Vanguard Productions and his advice to aspiring artists is invaluable.model kits...Gammill provided the concept art for dozens of different products.

Steve Geppi of Diamond Distribution provides the introduction to this volume and relates his own life-long love of Archie Comics.  One thing immediately noticeable about this volume is the cleavage on the girls, which was once completely banned back in the earlier days.  As with the last couple of volumes the editors selected those stories which documented the many trends and fads from the decade of the 80's.<br /><br />In \\"In the Swing\\" from 1981, Veronica dons the preppie look in a nostalgic look back to the fashions of the 40's.<br /><br />\\"Bo Woe\\" has Vernoica undergoing treatments to give her hair the \\"Bo Derek\\" look from the film \\"10\\" with braids and beads.  Problem is her new hair won't allow her to go out a boat date with a young playboy since she can't get her hair wet.<br /><br />\\"The Punk\\" from 1983 visits the punk music scene as Jughead cuts his hair into a Mohawk and begins calling himself Captain Thrash.  Archie does his best to try and save his friend from the punk scene but Jughead has an ulterior motive behind this radical change.<br /><br />In \\"Break Dancing Break\\" from 1984, The Archies are told that the only way that they can get some new gigs is to cut a video.  They have a hard time trying to come up with something catchy in their video until they enlist the aid of a group of street breakdancers to help them out.<br /><br />\\"Trivia Travesty\\" finds the gang playing the hottest new board game, Trivial Pursuit but things turn bad for Archie when his answers lead him to getting caught for two-timing Veronica with Betty.<br /><br />\\"Wheel of loot\\" is a spoof on the popular TV gameshow Wheel of Fortune as Betty stands-in for Vanna White as the games letter turner.<br /><br />In addition to these stories the book features stories on other great and no so great trends of the 1980's including the Urban Cowboy craze, ET the Extraterrestrial, Roller Disco, and Flash Dancing.  Even a Michael Jackson-like pop star shows up in the book.  As with the other books in this series we also get a couple of cover galleries with sample covers of the 1980's.  I've had a chance to review all seven volumes in the Archie Americana series and the set stands as a great testament to the popularity of the Archie character, still going strong after more than 60 years.  Throughout all the volumes the editors did a splendid job of choosing stories that were topical and representative of the various time periods.

This tiny publishing house that made its name by collecting the works of writers such as H.P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, and many others, is still going strong today and introducing new writers of weird horror and fantasy fiction.  This book provides a much needed guide to the nearly 70 years of Arkham titles and while it seems to be geared mainly to newcomers to Arkham House, even the most seasoned collectors will find the information valuable.<br /><br />The author, Barry Abrahams begins the guide with a brief history of Arhkam House and its founding by writer August Derleth to collect and publish the works of the late H.P. Lovecraft in 1939.  Abrahams also provides a biographical study on Lovecraft.  Following this there is information on collecting Arkham House books including book condition and grading, the value of dust jackets, repairs and restorations, signed copies, and general tips on the care of rare books.  The value of Arkham House books are especially tied into the availability and condition of the dust jacket which can amount to 75% of the book's value in some cases due to the scarcity of the jackets.  Abrahams also provides collectors with advice on buying & selling Arkham books, pricing, dealers, and buying on internet auctions and even looks at collecting Arkham House titles as investments.<br /><br />Chapter four begins the real meat of the book-a complete bibliography of every Arkham House title published through to the present day, beginning with \\"The Outsiders and others\\" in 1939 with a mere 1268 copies up to \\"A Rendezvous with Averoigne\\" in 2003.  The bibliography provides the title and author, the date of publication, page count, original price and print run, brief synopsis, and finally a current value of each title.  In addition to the Arkham House titles, Abrahams provides a bibliography of the Arkham imprints Mycroft & Moran, and Stanon & Lee.  Finally, there is a list of Arkham titles ranked by scarcity for the treasure hunters.<br /><br />Even if you are not a collector of Arkham House titles, and I am not, the book is still an invaluable resource for those who are fans of the many authors that Arkham has published over its long and storied history.  And while many titles are very rare and very expensive, others are far more affordable than you may have thought.  Leave it to McFarland Publishing to put out such an eclectic, yet indispensable title.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansont & Moran, and Stanon & Lee.

Many in our media is trying to convince us that Americans need to atone for our past transgressions and that terrorism is merely the result of hundreds of years of colonial oppression by the English and Americans.  Terrorists have now been sucessfully morphed into \\"freedom fighters\\" and on 9/11, many in the left fully believe we got what was coming to us.<br /><br />This is why this book by Robert Spencer is such a great read as he doesn't just lift the veil on this nonsense but rips it off and burns it.  Spencer's book is slap in the face at those that perpetuate this self-loathing attitude and want to revise history with America as the chief bad guy.  Even the communists are getting a free pass by these new age revisionists. He points out that the Jihad that has been called against us today is every bit a threat as the one Europe faced against the Muslim hordes centuries ago.  It's not meant to scare or frighten.  It's meant to slap us out of the comotose funk we've been in.<br /><br />Spencer will provide a look at the real Prophet Muhammad and show how cruel, blood-thirsty, and illicit he was.  Then there's the Koran with it's hate-filled teachings of anything non-muslim, it's treatment of women, and the opression of progress and why so many of these \\"freedom fighters\\" fear true democracy.  A marvelous book that must be read.	2005-08-04

Boyette worked in TV and film before moving into comics in the 1960's and directed, wrote, edited, even provided the narration for one of the great 1960's \\"b\\" horror movies \\"Dungeons of Harrow\\".  In fact calling it a \\"B\\" movie is perhaps being too kind.  Dungeons of Harrow would make most Monogram or PRC films look like \\"A\\" features.  That's not to say it's bad.  It's Plan B, so bad it's good.  It also has one of the more chilling and unsettling scenes of 60's horror films when the Count DeSade's wife is prowling the dungeons and gets up close and personal with the captives.  It's really a scream if you ever get a chance to see it.  But I'm digressing, we're talking about Boyette's work in comics and specifically this Nightstand Chillers trade which collects several of Boyettes horror tales for the first time.<br /><br />Pat worked for DC, Marvel, Jim Warren, but the bulk of his comic work was done on those great Charlton comics of the 60's and 70's like Ghost Manor and Ghostly Tales and The many Ghosts of Doctor Graves.  This stuff is so good and vastly under appreciated.  Any fans of horror comics would be in Heaven by haunting their local comic shops or conventions and buying up these great old Charlton comics which you can get for next to nothing.  This volume is filled with great stories and art by Boyette, most of which I know I never read since I didn't read many Charlton comics myself back then.  Some of the great stories included are:<br /><br />\\"The Vow\\" in which a man living in a plague-inflicted city is offered the opportunity (and safety) of running the crematorium, which has no shortage of business.  But he'll later find he perhaps made a mistake in moving into the building with his young daughter when she grows up to have an unnatural affection for the dead.<br /><br />\\"Carrion of the Gods\\" is an interesting re-thinking about how the Pyramids and Great Sphinx were created, long before Stargate came along.<br /><br />In \\"The Geek\\" a lonely widower befriends a curious little creature that eats live chickens.  Although the creature doesn't speak he is empathetic to the loneliness of the widower and tries to find a way to soothe his grief.<br /><br />The Wake of the Monster\\" has a demon relating his own life story and how he's influenced men over the years.<br /><br />Boyette's art is typical for the period and well suited to the black & white format that's showcased in this book.  In addition to these tales, J. David Spurlock of Vanguard productions conducts a lengthy and informative interview with Boyette and Marty Baumann of the Bmonster.com website has an article on the films of Pat Boyette.  Sadly, Pat passed away in 2000 but he's left behind a wealth of work for his fans to cherish for many years to come and hopefully Vanguard will issue further volumes showcasing Pat's talent.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonng re-thinking about how the Pyramids and Great Sphinx were created, long before Stargate came along.

In \\"The Horror Spoofs of Abbott & Costello\\" author Jeffrey Miller takes a look at the horror comedies the team did, with a particular focus on horror spoofs involving classic monsters.  Miller provides a complete cast and credit list along with a very lengthy and detailed synopsis of each film including many of the notable lines, gags, and scenes.  It also includes comments taken from cast and crew of the day and recent comments from the likes of Sara Karloff, Bela Lugosi Jr., and Paddy Costello, who were on the set of these films as children.  Miller also includes information on critical reviews of the day, box office results, as well as adding his own insightful analysis of the films.<br /><br />Without a doubt the most popular A & C spoof (in fact their most popular film period) was \\"Abbott & Costello meet Frankenstein\\".  Boris Karloff refused to appear in the film feeling it made a mockery of the monster.  Lon Chaney Jr. felt the film would forever ruin the classic Universal Monsters.  But time has proven them both wrong as the film works as both a comedy and a horror.  It's at least as scary as Chaney's role as Count Alucard in \\"Son of Dracula\\".  The fact that the film has legions of fans, including many famous filmmakers such as Quentin Tarrantino, is also a tribute to its staying power.  For his part, Lugosi enjoyed himself on the set.  One would guess he was probably just happy to be in a Universal production again as opposed to the poverty row films he had been doing in the 1940's.  There was a lot of pranks pulled on the set...some of these outtakes are even captured on the A&C Meet Frankenstein special edition DVD.  As has been pointed out on many occasions, this film would be Universal biggest moneymaker in years and virtually saved the studio from bankruptcy.<br /><br />While Karloff refused to do that film, he did sign on for two others including \\"Abbott & Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\"  Karloff would play this famous role for the first an only time but as Miller notes, the studio originally wanted Basil Rathbone for the part.  Both he and the boys were surprised at how well the film did at the box office.  The other films that Miller highlights in the spoof section are \\"Abbott & Costello Meet the Invisible Man\\" and the final spoof, \\"Abbott & Costello Meet the Mummy\\".  `Mummy' was their last film for Universal and by this time they were past their prime and not getting along well on the set.  Universal knew it was the end of the road and did little to support the film and it's become regarded as one of their worst (although it isn't really all that bad).<br /><br />Miller also looks as the teams other horror-comedies including \\"Hold that Ghost\\", \\"The Time of their Lives\\", and \\"Abbott & Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff\\".  \\"Hold that Ghost\\" is a particular favorite as its their version of and `old dark house' style film that was so popular in the 1930's and similar in style to the very good Bob Hope film \\"Ghost Breakers\\"  \\"Hold that Ghost\\" would even have Evelyn Ankers in the cast who would go on to become one of the great scream queens of the 1940's.<br /><br />Miller's research into these films is outstanding and while I'm a big fan, there were a lot of new things I learned.  While very detailed it's never dry and Miller does a wonderful job at conveying the great routines of Abbott & Costello.  Just beware if you have somehow never seen these films as the plot is fully described from beginning to end.  By all means see the films and then pickup this book.

He starts with an evaluation of the silent era and the German Expressionist films of Paul Wegener (The Golem), Robert Weine (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari) and F.W. Murnau (Nosferatu).  In these cases we have directors who fled the oncoming Nazi regime in their native land but these earlier works were a result of the socially repressive society.  The silent section is pretty sparse and Maddrey barely mentions the films of Lon Chaney Sr.<br /><br />From the silent films, Maddrey moves on to the classic horrors of the 30's and 40's. He links the popularity of these films to the depression and moviegoers enjoyment of seeing people onscreen taking matters into their own hands which was contrary to most American's lives of the day where one had little control over the social and economic conditions in which they lived.  I tend to think that analysts over think things and I believe that these films simply offered some escapism to Americans both during the depression and WWII.  Maddrey discussed many classics of the era including Frankenstein (although curiously mentions little about the superior sequel Bride of Frankenstein and its anti-religious overtones), Dracula, The Island of Lost Souls, Freaks, and many others.  Maddrey often quotes J. David Skal who wrote perhaps the best book on the culture of horror films \\"The Monster Show\\".  One of Maddrey's best evaluations is on the 1934 classic, \\"The Black Cat' which paired Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff together for the first time.  The social tragedy of WWI is the backdrop of the cat & mouse game between vengeful Lugosi and Satan-worshipping Karloff with the fate of two American newlyweds hinging on the outcome.  It's a remarkable film even today.  Succeeding chapters explore the anti-war/nuclear ramification films of the 1950's including War of the Worlds, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and many others as well as the films of Roger Corman and William Castle.  The book carries on into the modern gothic vampire films of today.<br /><br />The second part focuses on several film auteurs and their contributions to Horror films including Tod Browning, Alfred Hitchcock, Roger Corman, George Romero, John Carpenter, David Lynch and Wes Craven.  The examination of these directors is easily the best part of the book and I was especially happy to see Tod Browning covered in such depth.<br /><br />Nightmares in Red, White & Blue isn't really long enough to be considered a serious evaluation of horror films.  There are too many films omitted or covered only in brief.  But it does serve as a very good primer to the history of horror films, covering the major films, directors, and actors.  The second part of the book is really the meat of the book and this section is worth the price of the book alone.  Maddrey writes in a conversational style and he's certainly not as dry as Skal tends to be.  The book is well-researched although I would have liked to have heard Maddrey's opinions a bit more rather than relying on quotes from Skal and others.<br /><br />Reviewed By Tim Janson950's including War of the Worlds, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and many others as well as the films of Roger Corman and William Castle.

You could not go wrong with any of these accolades.  As his name suggests, Dickens was born in London although I do not know if he is related to his famous namesake author.  While Dickens worked as a freelance commercial artist, pin-up art was his first love and it was the onset of World War II that gave Dickens his break as his drawings of sweet, beautiful women would become a hot property to lonely servicemen who were far from home and far from their wives and girlfriends.  While Dickens' illustration style is clearly one of classical training it still holds up today and to today's younger artists who are very talented, but most of whom cannot capture that pure innocence of Dickens.  Those of us who are fans of his suffered a great loss when he passed away in 2004 at a robust 98 years of age.  Thankfully we will always have his prolific volume of work to remember him by.<br /><br />This is the second volume of Dickens pin-up art from SQP and features 50 previously unpublished works.  Dickens illustrated the all-American woman, even if they were not necessarily American.  In fact his illustrations of Spanish, Mexican, Dutch, American Indian, and other women were some of his most memorable works, and many are on display in this latest collection.  The Dickens woman was a classic beauty.  A real woman with real curves that didn't require augmentation, and oh those big, bright, playful eyes!  Dickens' use of soft colors accentuates the naughty, sexy, and spicy women he illustrates.  This collection features a variety of Dickens women at their lighthearted best, and ready for activities like golf and tennis.  There's a lovely witch, a good ol' cowgirl holding a mug of beer, a slave girl, and a gorgeous Veronica Lake-looking blond holding a little kitten.  This is truly a marvelous collection of work.<br /><br />The word legend is tossed around very lightly sometimes, but in the case of Archie Dickens it is not only fitting, but virtually the only word that works.  Hats off to SQP for another great collection!<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansontimes, but in the case of Archie Dickens it is not only fitting, but virtually the only word that works.

But as author Holly Mascot Nadler points out, this tiny island can more than old its own to the larger New England areas when it comes to a grand tradition of hauntings.  With colonial settlements going back as far as the mid-1600's, a native American presence before that, and formerly a haven for pirates and smugglers, this idyllic island can offer tales to chill the most ardent non-believer.  The book provides 21 true tales of ghosts and hauntings, some so recent that names have been changed to protect the privacy of those concerned.<br /><br />In the Bridge House in Chilmark, three different women all encountered the same spectral woman while staying in the home's \\"blue room\\".  In each case, the women were going through a difficult time in their lives and the specter, never threatening, seemed to be trying to offer some form of comfort as she merely stood staring at each woman.  They had all kept silent until a chance conversation revealed that they had all had similar experiences.<br /><br />The Edgartown House of Corrections has been the sight where the ghost of a man who hung himself in the 1950's haunts the building to this day.  What makes this story all the more intriguing is that many police officers have attested to encountering the ghost who turns the water on, turns lights and radios on and off, and walks throughout the jail.  The benevolent spirit has been known to calm other detainees who were upset.<br /><br />One terrifying tale tells of a great, grey-shingled house that has been the source of terror for some residents for years.  Many will not even walk by the house anymore.  One man living there apparently was driven mad and into a homicidal rage, grabbing a knife, and attacking several college girls who were vacationing in a nearby cottage.  Another ma committed suicide and another attempted it by leaping from a window only after lining up all the furniture in his room in a pseudo runway.  Could the house have been possessed by the spirits of ancient pirates?<br /><br />Then there is the house referred to as \\"The House of Dark Shadows\\", a rental home overlooking the sea.  Throughout the years various tenants have reported seeing strange shadows on the walls, shadows which seemingly have no like form in the room or outside to have created them.  Others mentioned that they awaoke from sleep in a panic as they felt their breath being sucked out of their lungs or seeing strange faces when they look into mirrors.  Many have mentioned items which disappear into thin air only to reappear hours or days later.  Small wonder why this home is considered the most haunted on the island.<br /><br />Holly Mascot Nadler also explores the theory that the supernatural may have played a part in the infamous Chappaquiddick Bridge accident involving Ted Kennedy.  Haunted inns, haunted campgrounds...you'll find all of this and more in this wonderful book.  You may never look at Martha's Vineyard the same way again.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonanother attempted it by leaping from a window only after lining up all the furniture in his room in a pseudo runway.

The 1970's was perhaps the most eclectic and trendy decade in American history with a new fad coming along every few months to capture the imagination of Americans.  Archie comics marched right along in time to all the changes the 1970's brought from protests to disco.  This volume collects 17 Archie stories that will make readers year for the days of pet rocks and CB radios.  Shirley Jones, Mrs. Partridge herself introduces this volume.<br /><br />In \\"Protest\\" from 1970, Archie is on the warpath and wants to get a sit-in protest staged with the rest of the gang.  The only trouble is that Archie can't seem to find a cause to protest but merely wants to protest because the rest of the country is.  Too bad for Arch that everyone if Riverdale seems relatively happy.<br /><br />\\"Bubble Trouble\\" features \\"The Archies\\" band in action.  You can almost hear them singing \\"Sugar Sugar\\".  When an editor of a music magazine calls their music \\"bubblegum music\\" Archie is not happy and goes to see the editor to voice his displeasure.  You wonder how much fun the writer had with this story since the Archies WERE about as bubblegum as you could get.<br /><br />In \\"No Fuel like and old Fuel\\" the gang finds themselves paralyzed by the energy crisis of the mid-1970's.  When Archie cannot get any gas to take Betty & Veronica on a picnic, he and Jughead cleverly make do by attaching a sail from Mr. Lodge's boat to sail to the park.  But what happens when it's time to leave and there is no wind?<br /><br />\\"You Came a Long Way Baby\\" finds Archie, or rather Betty and Veronica tackling the subject of Women's liberation in this tale from 1975.  Of all people, Miss, I mean Ms. Grundy leads the way!<br /><br />In \\"Bi-centennial Banter\\" the boys are working on their Bi-Centennial pageant when the girls, who had been excluded from the festivities, strongly display how many women played important roles in the fight for independence as well.<br /><br />\\"Over and Out\\" highlights one of the great fads of the 1970's the CB radio craze.  We all remember that don't we?  Arch and Veronica are staying in touch with oh-so-cute little handle names, not knowing that everyone is listening into their conversations.<br /><br />\\"Video Vexation\\" features another great fad and one that has actually survived and grown to this very day...the video game fad.  The boys are so into playing \\"Pong\\" that they begin to lose interest in the girls...until the girls turn out to be better players...<br /><br />\\"Costume Caper\\"  Pop culture comes home full tilt.  While not mentioning it by name, a costume party features several people dressed in Star Wars costumes.  Arch wins when he accidentally dresses up as \\"C3PO\\"<br /><br />As with the other Archie Americana books there are also cover galleries featuring some of the classic covers from the 1970's.  If you lived during this era like I did, you'll be certain to get a lot of laughs at looking back at some of the ridiculous fads and fashions of the wonderful decade of the 1970's.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonnt when the girls, who had been excluded from the festivities, strongly display how many women played important roles in the fight for independence as well. <br /> <br />\\"Over and Out\\" highlights one of the great fads of the 1970's the CB radio craze.

Everything from the books by well-known chefs and TV personalities to the small-press regional titles and everything in between.  Mastering Barbecue from Ten Speed Press isn't the biggest, it isn't the prettiest, but it is, simply, one of the best books on barbecue that I have ever read.  Many barbecue books will give you the basics on different grill types and methods but Mastering Barbecue goes into great depth on these subjects as well as BBQ terminology, food prep, cleanup and maintenance, cooking times and temperatures, types of wood to use, smoking, and much, much more.<br /><br />Mastering Barbecue isn't lavishly illustrated with color photographs on slick, glossy paper.  This is strictly a no-frills book that goes for punch over pizzazz and succeeds on all counts.  The strength of this book lies with its vast selection of recipes for rubs, marinades and sauces.  All told there are over 160 recipes for these staples of Barbecue cooking.  This is particularly noteworthy as far as the rubs which is the first step in preparing any meat for great barbecue.  Most cookbooks may provide just a handful of rub recipes but Mastering Barbecue gives you over 60 culled from a variety of different regions both domestic an abroad.  For example you'll find the Simple South Texas Rub, a Phoenix Rub, Kansas City Rub and a Latin American Rub.<br /><br />Marinades are another item that usually get short-changed in a lot of cookbooks but this book has over 50 great marinades and mop sauces, all designed to add great flavor to your food.  Like it hot?  Then try the Habanero Hot Sauce marinade.  There's also the North Carolina Vinegar mop and the Spicy Beer Marinade.<br /><br />The sauces are my favorite part of the book with over 50 great sauce recipes again taken from various regions to lend some authenticity to you food and also allow you to try different meats done in different regional styles.  There's a great Spicy Texas sauce with jalapeno peppers, fresh lime and beer; The Citrus BBQ Sauce features a variety of fruit juices including lemon, lime, and orange along with smoky chipotle peppers.  Or try the Kentucky Black Sauce made with a liberal amount of Kentucky bourbon, Worcestershire and soy sauces.  No matter what your taste you are sure to find several sauces you'll love.<br /><br />The book then goes on with chapters on beef, poultry, pork, ribs, seafood and veggies.  They all include helpful advice on buying these items, preparation, cooking, as well as the best woods to use to enhance the flavor.  I highly recommend the Mesquite grilled chicken breasts with citrus sauce.  The recipes here are not the kind of executive chef-created dishes that will have you scouring gourmet food stores to locate ingredients and requiring advanced techniques.  These are good, everyday recipes with ingredients that can be found at your local market and that can be made by even novice barbecue cooks.  The book is well-written and informative and includes an excellent cross-referenced index.  This is one that stands apart in a sea of Barbecue cookbooks.

Al Rio has a sensuous, powerful, and yet playful style and he can very from finely detailed pen & ink illustrations to slyly comical works where you have to pay attention to everything going on in the background.  This volume presents a rather eclectic sampling of the artist's work from rough pencil sketches to finished pen & ink illustrations.<br /><br />A major theme throughout the book is jungle women or cave women, some in the midst of battle with giant reptiles or apes, and some where they are simply lying demurely, frolicking with other jungle life.  While modern, it reminds me of the great art on the 30's and 40's jungle pulps as Al Rio does a great job conveying the action and movements in his works.  Besides the jungle themes, you'll find themes of horror, fantasy, bondage, angels, rockers, lesbians, and gun-blazing action.  His Lara Croft pieces are particularly outstanding.  Al Rio's art is very crisp with clean lines and amazing detail, particularly in his backdrops.<br /><br />The back cover sports a beautiful nude medusa in full color, smiling as she holds a skull, while her serpents writhe about.  In an outstanding piece called \\"Fuzzy Muffin\\" a lovely blonde seductress leans against her bed, holding a stuffed animal in a `strategic' location over her body.  \\"Ice Cream Dream\\" is an almost Mad Magazine-like scene with two very buxom women walking their dogs while the cartoon like men gawk in the background at the pair of beauties.  There are many pieces that harkens back to the classic pin-up days of the 40's and 50's such as the one depicting a sexy, topless artist, hard at work and thy shy, pony-tailed girl looking back over her right shoulder.<br /><br />The collection features both nude and non-nudes in a truly mesmerizing collection of gorgeous women.  Al Rio is an artist supremely talented and capable of working in any form or genre but his beautiful women are certainly the highlight of his work and a must have for anyone who is a fan of erotic or pin-up style art.g in any form or genre but his beautiful women are certainly the highlight of his work and a must have for anyone who is a fan of erotic or pin-up style art. <br />	2005-08-01

Filled with wonderful vintage photographs, the book highlights the many great sports champions produced in Detroit and the great athletes who would become legends.  Powerboat racing has been a major sport in Detroit for decades and the 20's focuses on the godfather of powerboat racing, Gar Wood.  Wood would capture the prestigious Gold Cup for five consecutive years in the 20's and would win it a total of nine times throughout the 20's and 30's.  1926 would see the construction of the Olympia stadium, which would be home to the Detroit Red Wings for over fifty years and where they would win seven Stanley Cup Championships.<br /><br />The 1930's were truly the glary age for Detroit sports.  In 1935, The Tigers, Lions, and Red Wings all won the championships of their sports.  The Tigers were leg by future Hall of Famers Charlie Gehringer, Hank Greenburg, and Goose Goslin.  The Lions would win their first ever NFL title in 1934 defeating the NY Giants and the Red Wings would capture the first of their ten Stanley Cups.  But these were not the only champions of that decade.  Joe Louis would capture the Heavyweight title in 1938 and hold the belt for over eleven years, solidifying him as one of boxing's all-time greats.  There's great photos of Louis in action, winning the title for the first time and later defeating Germany's Max Schmeling, as he carried the hope of an entire nation into the fight.  The thirties also saw the start of a great holiday tradition as the Lions would play their first Thanksgiving game in 1934 and would continue on to today.<br /><br />The 40's would see another Stanley Cup for the Red Wings in the 1942-1943 season and in 1946 a tall, think rookie made his debut, Mr. Hockey Gordie Howe.  The Tigers would capture another World Series in 1945 defeating the Chicago Cubs and Joe Louis dominated the entire decade in the ring.<br /><br />The 1950's was a dominant era in Detroit Sports as The Red Wings would win four more Stanley Cups and the Lions, led by all-time great QB Bobby Layne would win three NFL titles including a 59 - 14 route of the Cleveland Browns in 1957, the last Lions team to win a title.  You'll relive all of these great memories with the spectacular, and action-packed photography included in the book.

It seemed like a quick read and a pretty intriguing storyline so I gave it a try.  Well unfortunately I found myself disappointed rather quickly.  Reichs' character Temperance Brennan, a forensic Anthropologist is summoned to perform an autopsy on a Jewish man who has been murdered.  She is given a photograph of a skeleton taken at an archaelogical dig many years ago as a clue to the Jewish man's murder.  Temperance and Detective Ryan begin an investigation of the man and photograph and travel all the way to israel to investigate a convoluted plot involvling the ancient Jewish fortress of Masada and an ancient tomb that may have startliing ramifications for Christians.<br /><br />I should have been a bit worried at the obvious \\"davinci code\\" style of the plot but it did sound interesting.  Instead it's slow-moving with stilted dialog and a rather weak attempt at creating a Davini-esque style.  I guess it's ineveitable that there would be imitators to Dan Brown but Reichs is a talented writer in her own right and I don't think needs to jump on this bandwagon.	2005-07-28

Joe Frontline: History Repeating is an interesting Joe tale in that it is two interconnecting tales, although they could be read separately on their own.  The other interesting thing is the cast of characters.  This is a bit of a toned down Joe story.  There's no Snake Eyes, no Storm Shadow, in fact there's almost zero involvement by those major players we've come to expect.  That makes the story a bit refreshing and a decided change from previous G.I. Joe trade paperbacks. That's one reason why I enjoy the Frontline stories so much, they tend to go after some of the \\"smaller\\" scale stories.<br /><br />When a plane carrying a deadly experimental virus suddenly disappears right off radar, the Joe team is called in to investigate.  The plane is stolen by a rogue paramilitary group led by Tyler Wingfield, the son of Vance Wingfield who formed Strike First, a group that supplied personnel to Cobra.  \\"Chuckles\\" the Joe operative who has infiltrated Cobra is called in to broker a purchase of the virus on behalf of Cobra-or so Cobra thinks-but his real goal is to be a point man for the Joe team to swing in and recapture the virus before it can do any damage.  But Wingfield discovers Chuckles' true affiliation and uses him to initiate an attack on both the Joe's and Cobra as revenge for his father's death.  He now plans to launch a missile carrying the virus.  Can he be stopped in time?<br /><br />Again the refreshing thing is the cast in this book.  The Joe team consists of Beach Head, Air Tight, Flash, Trip Wire, and Chuckles, operatives who normally don't get much of a chance to shine.  It's nice to see a story dedicated to some of the lesser known Joes rather than the usual starring cast. The book is also less action-oriented and more of an espionage thriller with covert ops, CIA moles, double agents, all thrown into the mix.  A very nice change of pace story.  Brandon Jerwa provides the story with pencils by Eddy Barrows and Inks by Cory Hamscher.	2005-07-27

When it comes to horror and sci-fi, there is no better writer than Tom Weaver, and his latest book \\"Earth Vs. the Sci-fi Filmmakers\\" is further proof.  Similar to his \\"I was a Monster Movie Maker\\" Weaver this time presents 20 interviews with some of the men and women who worked on some of the great sci-fi films, primarily of the 50's and 60's.  Actually Sci-fi is a bit of a misnomer since the interviews are conducted with people who have worked not only on sci-fi films, but also on horror and fantasy as well.  The acknowledgements at the beginning of the book is like a who's who of these genres including Ted Bohus and Kevin Clement of Chiller Theatre, Jim Clatterbaugh of Monsters from the Vault, Buddy Barnett of Cult Movies, collector Bob Burns, and film historian Rudy Behlmer.<br /><br />Weaver's knowledge of these films and the actors makes for interviews that are in-depth and informative, not the typical throwaway reviews you may get with some writers.  Some of the actors you'll know, some you may not, but you're sure to know the films they helped to immortalize.<br /><br />Gene Barry, who starred in the original \\"War of the Worlds\\" is the subject of the first interview and is actually probably the weakest of the group.  You get the feeling that he didn't want to expound to much on that film and says quite candidly that he didn't care much for science fiction.  Barry would go on to do numerous TV shows including \\"Bat Masterson\\", \\"Burke's Law\\" and \\"The Name of the Game\\"<br /><br />Gary Conway is a great example of a guy whose name you might not know, but you know his role in \\"I was a Teenage Frankenstein\\" from the 1950's under that hideous mass of makeup.  Conway talks about the ordeal of getting done up everyday and how hot and uncomfortable the mask/makeup was.  He also discusses the lesser known sequel \\"How to Make a Monster\\" as well as his time working with Roger Corman on \\"The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent\\".  How's THAT for a title.  Conway provides one of the stronger interviews in the book.<br /><br />The interview with the late Merian C. Cooper wasn't conducted by Weaver, obviously.  The interview was taken from an audio tape from 1964 provided by Bob Burns who attended a small gathering of friends that turned into an impromptu Q & A session with the legendary writer/director of \\"King Kong\\".  Cooper discusses the various armatures and different style heads used for Kong in the movie as well as the animation process among many other topics.  The most interesting tidbit is that Cooper had an associate sign his contract for the film while he was out of town and it left Cooper without a financial cut of the film.<br /><br />Donnie Dunagan is one of the most interesting interviews in the book.  Dunagan played the much-maligned role of Basil Rathbone's son Peter Von Frankenstein, in \\"Son of Frankenstein\\".  For years fans have argued how Dunagan's performance was the worst thing about the film so it was interesting to get his take on the performance and to also realize that he was five years old at the time.  Dunagan would also share his thoughts on Karloff, Rathbone, and Lionel Atwill, although curiously, Lugosi is not mentioned.  Dunagan would go on to become a career U.S. Marine, achieving the rank of Major and having three tours of Viet Nam.<br /><br />Peter Graves is known to most people as the star of \\"Mission Impossible\\" and as one of the hosts of A&E's Biography.  But before that, Graves starred in a number of great Sci-Fi \\"B\\" movies including \\"It Conquered the World\\", \\"Red Planet Mars', and \\"Killers from Space\\".<br /><br />Other interviews include Arch Hall Jr. who starred in the cult films \\"Eegah!\\" and \\"The Sadist\\"; writer ken Kolb who wrote the fantasy epic \\"The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad\\"; Mary Mitchel who starred in such \\"B\\" movie gems as \\"Panic in Year Zero\\", \\"Spider Baby\\", and \\"Dementia 13\\"; and Frankie Thomas who played Space Cadet Tom Corbett in one of TV's very first outer space shows from 1950 - 1955.<br /><br />What I love about Weaver is that he never minimizes the contributions of his interview subjects.  Most of these people have not been active in film or TV for decades but Weaver never handles them as if they were a novelty.  He asks the right questions and the subjects seem generally surprised and delighted at his familiarity with their work.  Throughout the book vintage photos from the films are included as well as many current photos of the actors today.

He's the first, and greatest superhero ever, the man who not only was faster than a speeding bullet, but more importantly the man who was able to survive the golden age fallout of superhero comics and continue to thrive almost 70 years later.  Les Daniels' magnificent book traces the history of Superman from his humble beginnings, to the major marketing franchise it is today. It's the story of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, a couple of young men from Cleveland who putting the ideas for this new and fantastic character down on paper as early as 1933, and then struggled for years to get the feature sold.  We see a rare cover, the only page surviving from 1933, after Joe Shuster burned the rest of the pages in frustration.  The spotlight reviewer contends that Daniels does not give credit to Siegel and Shuster and even takes stabs at the pair.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The book details the pairs drive to get the character sold, and their diligence is well documented by Daniels.  It's a tribute to their persistence that Superman is around today.  Had they thrown in the towel after their many rejections Superman would never have seen the light of day.  I think that pays them high tribute.  There's no doubt that DC comics made millions...no billions off Superman and that Siegel and Shuster did not benefit much from this.  Unfortunately, the pair, so desperate to get the idea in print, signed away their rights to the character.  It may have been cheap on DCs part, no doubt, but creators simply did not own their characters back then.<br /><br />Daniels goes onto to show how Superman was a smashing success right out of the gate and would go onto conquer virtually every form of media of the day including newspaper strips, animated shorts, movie serials, feature films, radio, TV, and incredible merchandising.  Daniels traces Superman's adventures from the enemy-smashing efforts of WWII, to the ridiculous, often silly stories of the 1950's, to Superman's death and eventual resurrection in the 1990's.  Daniels traces all those others who were key in making Superman the American Icon he has become, particularly the late Julius Schwartz who basically created the Silver Age of comics and guided superman for years and artists the late Wayne boring the primary superman artist after Shuster and through the mid-1950's, and the late Curt Swan who took over in the mid-1950's and was the primary artist on Superman for the next thirty years.<br /><br />But the book isn't all about the comic books.  We'll see Superman in the great Fleischer cartoons of the 1940's, his early film appearances by Kirk Alyn, and then on TV with George Reeves...Heck there was even a Superman musical in the 1960's.  Superman would be re-vitalized in the 1970's when Christopher Reeves played the Man of Steel in four big-screen films before the character would return to TV in the romantic Lois and Clark, and the new look at Clark Kent as a young man in the smash hit \\"Smallville\\".  Daniels covers it all including the wonderful animated series on WB, and the controversies surrounding Superman's \\"death\\" and resurrection and eventual marriage to Lois Lane.  Daniels leaves no stone unturned, even providing great photos of vintage and current Superman toys and other collectibles.<br /><br />Siegel and Shuster are given their proper due for the creation of Superman, but it was an entire host of talented writers, artists, actors, animators, and directors that have turned the character into the legend that he has become.  This is a terrific book for any fan of the character.  Well-written and researched.and eventual resurrection in the 1990's.

Odd the way style is...the once considered tacky and gaudy kitchen designs of the 1950's are now hot among collectors and homeowners today as everyone is going retro.  Walk into a Target store and see how they've adopted to the look of the 1950's with their brightly colored new appliances and gadgets.  I guess after years of having everything being so uniform and style not mattering, people are again looking to spice up their homes with color.  \\"Atomic Kitchen\\" is a great source of reference for people looking to capture that retro look, or just take a glimpse back in time some 50's years ago to see what homemakers of the time had available to them.<br /><br />The book begins with an introduction to...the kitchen and points out how the kitchen came to replace the family hearth as the central gathering place for friends and family.  As new, smaller homes were built in the 1950s, the dining room was often replaced with a larger kitchen in order to serve both functions of preparing food and eating it.  Thus it became important for homemakers to be able to express their style but also have great functionality as well.  For the first time, appliances not only had to work good, but they had to look good as well.  Color was the order of the day.  Not only with small appliances but large appliances as well.  Consumers had an entire rainbow of colors to choose from, from bright reds and yellows to soft blues and pinks, and everything could be color coordinated.<br /><br />Atomic Kitchen provides hundreds of vintage advertising that display the latest and greatest in new items for the home...all designed to be better and make your life easier.  The 50's saw an explosion in new gadgets for the home.  You had to have a handy new gadget to do everything from opening cans and jars to crushing ice, to making waffles.  If there was a task that needed to be done, some manufacturer was going to come up with a new, electric way of getting it done automatically.  Rival had an entire line of such items like the Juice-o-mat, Slice-o-mat, grind-o-mat, ice-o-mat, and who knows how many more.  One could buy knife sharpeners, potato chip makers, sandwich toasters, ravioli makers...no mundane task was ignored it seems.  But even with all these new appliances, they were still heavy-duty, often made of stainless steel and built to last years...unlike the almost disposable appliances we have to contend with today.<br /><br />It's such a treat just to browse through this book and see the many wonderful items, many long-forgotten, that were in use fifty years ago.  These ads give us a glimpse into an era when these new appliances must have been looked at as life-savers for people's kitchens.  Just a fantastic book!e line of such items like the Juice-o-mat, Slice-o-mat, grind-o-mat, ice-o-mat, and who knows how many more.

Joe Battlefiles Index is kind of like those old Marvel Universe comics from the 1980's.  Inside you'll find profiles of all the Joe Team and Cobra Members, as well as the various affiliates and splinter groups.  The Joe listing begins with all of the current Joe Members and includes everything you could ever want to know about each character including real names (unless classified), how they joined the Joe team, their various skills and fields of expertise and much, much more.  They are actually far more detailed than the Marvel Universe.  It also includes deceased operatives and a history of how the Joe team was formed.  The Cobra section is pretty much the same and includes a history of Cobra but they are broken down into groups such as Destro's forces, The Dreadnoks, etc...There is also a Cobra chain of command listing all of the various troop types such as the Crimson Guard, Tele-vipers, and so on.<br /><br />But it's not just an index of personnel.  One of the things many people love about the G.I. Joe comics is the weaponry and vehicles employed by Joe and Cobra and those are also spotlighted and include information on size, weight, speed, and armament.  Great art accompanies the text by Many artists and it complements the work very well.  This is a nice source book for anyone who is a fan of the G.I. Joe team and updated for the 21st century as well with current continuity.  Great stuff!	2005-07-25

Allen St. John may be unfamiliar to a lot of people but St. John was one of the first great adventure artists and would influence countless others that would come after him including Hal Foster, Margaret Brundage and Frank Frazetta.  St. John was a professor of drawing and painting at the Chicago Art Institute and a contemporary of N.C. Wyeth and Howard Pyle.  St. John was already an accomplished illustrator but it would be his work on Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan, John Carter, and Pellucidar books where he would become a legend.<br /><br />This book from Vanguard Productions, takes an overview of St. John's career including a brief, but informative, biographical sketch.  Examples of his work are broken down into sections by subject:  John Carter, Tarzan, Adventures on Venus, Pellucidar, as well as his works in the pulps.  St. John's work combined the look of classical illustration of the Art Deco period with the fantastic.  The pieces in the book range from pencil sketches, ink washes, and even charcoal.  His use of subtle light and shading techniques is masterful and nearly a lost art on many modern illustrators.  What really grabs you when you look at his work is the realism of bodies and body movement.  His subjects were real people...not products of steroids and breast implants.  His characters had a gracefulness to their movements and were not exaggerated as we see so often today.  St. John also was able to capture the exotic locales of Burroughs' work magnificently.<br /><br />I was struck by a number of pieces in the book.  Tarzan stands upon a thick tree limb, a spear poised ready for battle as a panther tried to gain a foothold on the limb to attack.  In another example, from \\"Tarzan the Terrible\\", Tarzan finds himself in a desperate battle for his life with a monstrous reptile that looks like something out of \\"The Land that Time Forgot\\".  Still another piece from a Pellucidar story shows Dian the Beautiful holding off a sabre-tooth tiger with a spear.  This clearly was an influence on a similar painting by Frazetta entitled \\"Savage Pellucidar\\".<br /><br />The last section deals with St. John's work in the pulp magazines where we worked for Fantastic Adventures, Amazing Stories, and Weird Tales, among others and illustrated stories for some of the top pulp writers of all-time.  For any fan of Burroughs' work, pulp or fantastic art, this is a marvelous work by a talent who doesn't get enough notoriety.  This is a 176 page, soft-cover book and another winner from Vanguard Productions.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansona spear.

It's almost like they want to take all possible work and imagination out of the hands of the DM.  Frostburn, as the name implies contains supposedly all the information you could ever want...in fact you WON'T want a lot of it...about adventuring into cold climates.  There's info about dealing with the cold, hypothermia, snow blindness...There are frosty (and I really can't think of a better term...) versions of the standard demi-human races like glacial dwarves, snow elves, and ice gnomes, along with some new races such as the Uldra.<br /><br />There are a number of new feats(32 in all I believe) and prestige classes but their really only usable in these colder climates so I'm thinking there's not much value there except maybe to the DM for NPCs unless your entire campaign is set in the arctic.  The next two chapters deal with new equipment and spells.  I didn't find all that much of interest in the equipment chapter but some of the new spells are pretty interesting such as the Column of Ice spell and Iceberg.  There are also a couple of new domains for clerics:  winter and cold.<br /><br />Chapter six details new monsters although a lot of them are ones you're already familiar with such as the Yetis, as well as cold version of typical monsters like spiders, undead, etc.  There are a couple of adventures included which I'd say may be about the best thing in the book.  The Iceraver scenario has characters going to a haunted city on an iceberg.<br /><br />As I mentioned...I think a lot of it is simply overkill.  This could easily have been just an adventure with new spells, monsters, etc, without all of the rules about dealing with cold that most people will never use.	2005-07-22

In an era where generic, noisy, bar & grill restaurants crowd every street corner, the days of mom & pop diners and their home-cooked specialties are sorely missed.  Retro Diner from Collectors Press is an ode to the golden age of diners and diner foods.  Filled with over 115 recipes as well as vintage photographs, menus and advertising, Retro Diner is a look back at those days of spinning seats and gum stuck under the counter.<br /><br />The book begins with a short introduction of the history of diners and how they originated out of the need to fill hungry workers who worked late shifts when most restaurants were closed.  They hit their peak in the 1950's in the time of juke boxes and car hops and those magnificent train car-style diners that most of us only know from seeing in film and TV.  Thankfully diners have undergone a resurgence in popularity in recent years, thanks in part to TV and film.  Many have taken on the task of restoring the old places and many new diners have been built in that classic 50's and 60' styling.<br /><br />Retro Diner presents the authentic recipes, culled from these various diners, arranged into sections such as breakfasts, soups, sandwiches, and the ever-popular \\"Blue Plate Specials\\".  Start your day with easy home made biscuits, southern-style corn fritters, or corn beef hash and eggs.<br /><br />Soups & Sandwiches were always a popular choice among diner patrons.  Enjoy the Corn Chowder from the Sweetheart Diner or Cream of Mushroom from Harry's Midnight Diner.  How about a Count of Monte Cristo sandwich in all it's battered, deep-fried glory or the patty melt from Blue Moon Diner.<br /><br />Every diner had it's \\"Blue Plate Special\\" and Retro Diner presents no less than ten classic recipes for an all-time diner favorite, meatloaf.  Then there's the Dinner Pie from Jack's D.C. Diner and Hungarian Goulash from Zippy's; chicken-fried steak, chicken and dumplings, BLT's, Apple Pie, and so much more.  Even if you don't enjoy the recipes, you're sure to enjoy this trip down memory lane.y the recipes, you're sure to enjoy this trip down memory lane. <br />	2005-07-22

The \\"Picture Show\\" is a vibrant and eclectic collection of movie posters culled from Turner Classic Movie's library of over 3500 vintage films.  The book is an over-sized, soft cover reprinting hundreds of movie posters.  Lesser known films may appear two or three to a page while greater classics are reprinted in full page glory.  The book begins with a short history of movie posters and the explanation of \\"One-sheets\\" \\"Half-Sheets\\", \\"Three Sheets\\" etc...before breaking down the posters into several different chapters.<br /><br />We lead off with \\"Bad Girls\\" and movies like \\"The Mask of Fu-Manchu\\", \\"The Outlaw\\", and \\"Born to be Bad\\".  These are some of the more sexy and seductive posters found and highlight screen vamps such as Bette Davis, Myrna Loy, Joan Fontaine, and Jane Russell.  From there the next chapter features the Battle of the Sexes, featuring classic films like the Thin Man movies, and the various Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn films.<br /><br />The chapter on Fancy Footwork highlights those great musicals of the 30's and 40's such as \\"Footlight Parade\\" with James Cagney, \\"Girl Crazy\\" with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, and \\"An American in Paris\\" with Gene Kelly.  Forward March reprints posters from great war films.  \\"Back to Bataan\\" and \\"Flying Leathernecks\\" with John Wayne, musicals like \\"Anchors Aweigh\\" and \\"Follow the Fleet\\" and one of my favorites \\"The Dirty Dozen\\"<br /><br />Since Warner Bros is one of the prominent studios featured we naturally get to see many of their great adventure film posters included:  \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\", \\"Captain Blood\\", and \\"The Sea Hawk\\" as well as \\"The Three Musketeer\\" and \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\"  There are also chapters devoted to westerns and to tough guys like Cagney, Mitchum, Bogart and McQueen.<br /><br />The last chapter is devoted to sci-fi and horror films including the Val Lewton flicks \\"I Walked with a Zombie\\" and \\"Cat People\\" along with sci-fi's \\"The Thing\\" and \\"Them!\\"  Movie posters are very underrated as an art form and interest in collecting posters is at an all-time high.

This is a well diversified sampling of both high-profile classics as and \\"B\\" movies.  The only short-coming of the book is that it only features the posters of three studios:  MGM, Warner Bros., and RKO.  Classic horror fans will no doubt be a little let down that Universal's films are not included.  I'm not sure why but it's a serious oversight.  The horror/sci-fi section is quite skimpy overall.

Build a Better Burger presents the winning recipes from the annual Build a Better Burger National Cook-off held annually and sponsored by Sutter Home.  Recipes begin trickling in during the Summer and the best are invited to compete in early Fall in the beautiful Napa Valley where the grand prize is a whopping $50,000.  With that kind of money on the line, you know that these are people who take their burgers seriously.  The book begins with a brief but breezy history of the burger as well as some of the notable fast food burger chains such as McDonald's and White Castle.<br /><br />The book presents the winning recipes by year beginning with 1990.  These are no everyday burgers, however.  These creative recipes use just about any ingredient you can think of.  Not limited to just beef, these recipes call for ground turkey, chicken, pork, buffalo, lamb, tuna, Salmon, even Italian sausage and shrimp!  Among the exotic burger recipes contained in the book are such gems as:  Three nut turkey Burgers with tropical fruit salsa, Peppered Lamb Burgers with hot tomato jam, Salmon Burgers with Lemon cilantro mayonnaise, Samurai Burgers made with tuna, plum jam, and fish broth, and Chipolte Honey BBQ Bacon Burgers with Gorgonzola cheese.  No...these are not your everyday backyard burgers.<br /><br />That's its appeal and maybe a bit of its weakness as well.  First, many of the recipes contain some rather unusual ingredients.  Items such as Moscato, South African peppadew, and dried Guajillo chiles are things you probably won't find in the average grocery store.  The recipes are well presented with gorgeous color photography of the finished creations.  They're certainly mouth-watering to view but I wonder if they will have broad appeal.  Honestly looking through the dozens of recipes I could only pick a handful that I'd really want to try out.  Perhaps others are more adventurous than me.  If you are, then this is certainly a great place to start for some new and exciting recipes.recipes. <br />	2005-07-19

Wizards of the Coast has given D&D role-players supplements on evil characters and evil monsters, but Fantasy Flight Games has done them one better...and in a big way...by developing a complete campaign based on an entirely evil setting.  Midnight 2nd edition presents gamers with one of the most unique locales ever developed for fantasy role-playing.  It's a world where good is outnumbered.  No...vastly outnumbered is more appropriate against the legions of evil in a dark, grim, and brooding world that is starving for heroes.<br /><br />The developers begin with a background story of how the Dark God Izrador was cast out of Heaven by the other Gods but in doing so, Izrador severed the link between the celestial home of the gods and the mortal world.  This resulted in a cataclysm that shook the world of Aryth, and forever cut the inhabitants off from the Gods they worshipped...Except for Izrador whose shadow fell to the world.  Aryth was left in darkness and even the souls of the deceased found themselves unable to go to their final resting place, trapped by the Veil which keeps them, as well as multitudes of demons, elementals, and other-planar creatures trapped, as all links to outer planes, including the astral and ethereal were destroyed.  After two failed attempts, the Dark God and his legions finally succeeded in breaking the free people of the lands when their four greatest heroes were corrupted by Izrador's power.  These four now serve as his lieutenants and are known as the Night Kings.  Then there are \\"The Fell\\", the dead who return to life to attack the living when their souls are not permitted to move on.<br /><br />The world of Midnight presents a unique challenge to players.  Evil is decidedly in control.  Use of Magic is punishable by death except for Izrador's minions, meaning that players who choose magic-users are constantly being hunted down by the Dark God.  Magic items tend to be rare as these are also sought out and destroyed by the Dark God.  But players have many other things going for them.  First, all players get to choose a heroic path.  This path grants the character new powers or abilities as each new level is gained.  For example, choosing the \\"Fell Hunter\\" path gives the PC abilities in battling undead.  They are able to do increased damage against all undead and also gain immunity to the various special attacks of the undead such as disease, paralyzation, and energy drain.  These heroic paths serve to add greater depth to the characters and allow players to tailor their characters even more.  There are also some decidedly different half breed races you can play as including Dworgs, the result of breeding between orcs and dwarves and Elflings, a mix of elf and Halfling.<br /><br />Midnight presents standard classes as well as 15 new prestige classes designed for daunting challenges that adventuring in Midnight poses.  These are some of the most creative prestige classes I have ever seen.  There's the Avenging Knife, the assassins of Izrador's minions, The Haunted Ones, those who have the ability to communicate with the many displaced and tormented spirits of the world, and the Warrior Arcanists, a non-multi-classed warrior mage.  These, along with many new, and powerful feats and spells, add up to some great new PCs to begin play with.<br /><br />But Midnight isn't just designed for players.  The second part of the book is for DMs and details the various lands of Aryth with information on the various towns and settlements, peoples, languages, religions, trade & craft, and governance.  Each region also has many places on interest that serve well as hooks for possible future adventures that the DM can design.  This allows the DM to develop his or her own exclusive adventures from the ideas the book presents.  There's also a lengthy section covering the \\"Servants of Shadow\\" including Izrador himself, along with his Night Kings and the various ranks of his many underlings.  Finally, the book presentsa starting adventure as well as ideas of how the DM can use any of the other Midnight adventures into their campaign.<br /><br />Midnight is like Lord of the Rings meets Night of the Living Dead with a sprinkling of biblical mythos thrown in to boot.  This is not a fantasy world that just sort of lies there.  The inside back and front covers feature a map of the world although it would have been great if a fold-out map had been included.  This is a living, breathing, and starkly terrifying world to adventure in and one of the best campaigns I've seen in a long time.

The field of erotic fantasy art has been dominated by men ever since the pin-up days of the 40's & 50's.  But in the Art of Arantza we are presented with a bold and fantastic female perspective from a rising star, Arantza.  In this 64 page collection the brilliant Spanish artist shows off some of her most beautiful creations.  While many female artists are content to illustrate serene pictures of angels or unicorns, Arantza proves she can produce not only eye-popping works of traditional fantasy art, but can also do so with an erotic slant.<br /><br />What strikes me about the breath-taking women in this book is their natural look.  So many male artists draw their women with exaggerated breasts but Arantza's women are natural and graceful in their beauty and in their poses.  Natural...but no less fantastic!  Inside this book you'll find a dazzling array of battle-ready warriors, Dragon-riders, sexy vampires, captive slave women, sorceresses, blood-spattered demons, and lusty pirates.  Arantza uses light and shadow with remarkable skill and her work is amongst the most detailed I've ever seen.<br /><br />It would be impossible to pick a favorite but some of the pieces that I love include:<br /><br />A horned, female vampire, holding a chalice of blood, her head tilted back as if savoring the flavor as blood drips down her chin and neck.<br /><br />Another female vamp, clothes in torn tatters, is chained to a wall, struggling to free herself from her bondage<br /><br />A gorgeous beauty lies upon her bed asleep while a ravenous wolf prowls just outside the window with a bright quarter moon looming overhead.<br /><br />A Mermaid rests languidly upon a rocky shore as a ship sails by in the background.<br /><br />And lest you think her art is restricted to women, she provides several examples of wild-eyed, mighty barbarians that would make Frazetta stand up and take notice.  This is not cheesecake art, however.  These females are confident and commanding.  While this book shows off her pencil drawings, Arantza works in oils, cartoon, animation, even children's illustration and is adept at all.  This is a spectacular book by a great talent and highly recommended for fans of fantasy or erotic art.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson.

Santa pushing Camels, Prince Albert, and Budweiser?  No, it's not scenes from the politically incorrect scrapbook, but it call can be found in this great new book of classic tobacco and alcohol advertising of the 40's, 50's and 60's.  Filled with classic ads and sidebar bits of trivia, \\"What's your Poison?\\" is a great look back at how advertising has changed over the past fifty years or so.  In the 40's and 50's, testimonial ads were widely used.  And it didn't seem to matter whose testimonial it was so long as you had a large enough group endorsing your product.  Naturally celebrity endorsements were highly sought after by both tobacco and alcohol makers and they are among the most amusing to read.  One great ad shows several prominent celebrities including John Wayne Maureen O'Hara, Alan Ladd, and Brian Keith, all offering their praise of the taste and mildness of Camel cigarettes.  Then there's Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis dressed in sailor costumes pushing Chesterfields and a somewhat inebriated David Niven in a graduate's cap extolling the virtues of Carling's Ale.<br /><br />Incredibly, doctor's endorsements were featured prominently in many ads during this period.  One ad proudly boasts that \\"More doctors smoke Camels than any other brand!\\"  And a sidebar shockingly relates that in 1955, 53% of all doctors smoked compared to just 3% some forty years later.  Doing anything they can to push their products, the tobacco companies frequently advertised their products as having less nicotine and giving no irritation to your throat.<br /><br />Among the most entertaining ads are the ones from the holidays.  A brother and sister greet their dad with a carton of Chesterfields, wrapped up in a bright red bow.  And there's a serene Christmas setting as you look out through the window on a snow-covered village under a bright, peaceful moon...with a bottle of scotch in the foreground.  And Santa pitched everything from cigarettes, to pipe tobacco, to lighters, and booze.  A master salesman!<br /><br />Beer fans will enjoy seeing the advertising of many forgotten beer brands such as Ballantine, Blatz, Goebel, and my dad's favorite when I was a kid, Hamm's!  What was advertised as \\"premium\\" beers in the 50's was the bottom of the shelf cheap stuff in the 70's and 80's.

He was the first comic book artist whose comics I actively sought out and collected.  Like most of the great artists of the late 60's and 70's, Adams kept his runs on titles short but memorable.  His work on the X-Men, Avengers, Green Lantern, and Batman are Silver Age classics.  And I remember how happy I was to find Conan the Barbarian #37 with the Adams cover and art.  He remains one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />\\"Monsters\\" collects into one volume for the first time a story that appeared in \\"Echo of Future Past\\" from Continuity Comics, Adams' own company.  In his introduction, Adams expresses his love for monsters but laments that Dracula, The Wolfman, and The Frankenstein Monster never battled in those old Universal films although he did forget about \\"Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein\\".<br /><br />The story opens as a young couple are running for their lives from a pack of ravenous wolves until a stately man upon horseback call the \\"dogs\\" off.  Their rescuer is overjoyed to find out that the young man is Vincent, the nephew of Victor Frankenstein.  Vincent explains that he and his fianc&eacute;e had to escape from the villagers who killed his uncle after his monster went on a rampage.  But they quickly find out their rescuer, Prince Vlad, AKA Count Dracula, is no friend.  He kidnaps Vincent's fianc&eacute;e, Ericka\\" and forces Vincent to make a new monster.  He needs the monster to look after him while he sleeps, and is vulnerable, during the daylight hours.  Vincent creates a new monster which immediately breaks free, goes on a rampage, and throws his beloved to her apparent death.  But she finds herself bitten by a werewolf and it all climaxes in a battle royal.<br /><br />If my summary seems simplistic it's because that's exactly what the plot was.  Adams' script is just a vehicle to get these three monsters together and at each other's throats.  Granted, it's better than the horrendous \\"Van Helsing\\" film of 2004, but not by much.  At least Neal's art is more pleasing to the eye than two hours of CGI effects.  I found Dracula's explanation of why he needed a monster to watch out for him during the day to be a bit silly.  I mean, a simple-witted member of the living dead doesn't seem like it would make the best watchdog.  That's why vampires have human thralls, such as Renfield, to care for them.<br /><br />Adams stated in the introduction that he could not depict these monsters looking anything like Universal's copyrighted appearances.  I can live with that but I'm not so sure I like my Dracula as a blond, with wavy hair and a Fu-Manchu-style mustache.  He looked more like a character from a 1970's cop movie than \\"The Prince of Darkness\\".  I enjoyed the book as a fan of Neal's art but the story left me a little flat.  In addition to the story, there is also a small gallery of monster-related covers than Neal did for Marvel, mostly during the 1970's as well as some of his production sketches from films he worked on.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson2004, but not by much.

Remember the episode of Seinfeld where Kramer wrote a coffee table book about coffee tables?  Well this is a TV book about...TV's.  Not TV shows or TV actors, but that glorious box from which we derive so much entertainment.  Specifically this is about TV of the 50's and 60's and one of those retro, pop-culture books that Collector's Press does so well.  Through this collection of vintage advertising and lively bits of trivia, we see the development of television throughout TV's golden age.<br /><br />We'll see as TV's develop from tiny 10\\" screens in mammoth, radio-type cabinets, to 21\\" color TVs in the 1960's.  Along the way you'll revisit long forgotten brands such as Spartan, Capehart Farnsworth, Arvin, Air King, and Crosley.  You'll chuckle at what passed for a portable TV with the large, box-like models from Philco and G.E.  The ads tell the story of TVs advancement as they tout new antennas designed to give better reception in those pre-cable days and Westinghouse's new models for 1954 which were supposed to cut down on glare if watching in a dark room.<br /><br />In those days, the TV was as much a part of the d&eacute;cor as any other piece of furniture and manufacturers gave customers a wide selection of different wood cabinets to choose from like cherry and maple.  Some even housed radios making the first entertainment centers.  TVs came in a rainbow of colors in the 50's and 60's too, especially the portables coming in bright reds, light blues, and yellows.  Tacky?  You bet...a lot more fun than today's cookie-cutter models.<br /><br />And don't forget color pictures!  TV Wonderland presents the very first color TVs such as the RCA Victor Color which started at a whopping $495.00, quite a sum back in the 1950's.  The book is also sprinkled with interesting bits of trivia.  As a testament to the popularity of westerns in the early days, during the 1958-1959 TV season seven of the top ten shows were westerns.<br /><br />This is a marvelous little book.  Well written with hundreds of classic advertising that will make you yearn for the days of your black & white Zenith!Well written with hundreds of classic advertising that will make you yearn for the days of your black & white Zenith! <br />	2005-07-18

Get Fuzzy is without a doubt one of the ten best strips out there today and one I always love to read.  I've always enjoyed funny animal strips and comics and Darby Conley has his characters of crabby cat Bucky and poor put-upon Satchel the dog down to a \\"T\\" with a wit and biting sarcasm that is laugh out louad funny.  Conley has a smooth and wondefully expressionist cartooning style in an age when so many strips are bland.  His characters often say as much with their expressions, even their eyes, as they do with their words.  If I am to offer a mild complaint I'd only say I'd like to see these collections be a little bigger than just 128 pages.  That said this is another winner in the \\"Get Fuzzy\\" collection!	2005-07-14

Conan - Tales of the Black Kingdoms is the latest in the line of outstanding supplements from Mongoose Publishing set within the Hyborian kingdoms during the ancient, forgotten era of Conan the Barbarian.  In this supplement, the players travel to those dark jungles of lands such as Keshan, Darfar, Kush, and the Black Coast for three adventures that can be played separately or as one full campaign.  The first adventure, \\"Shroud over Zabhela\\" is designed for five to six PCs of 3rd to 4th level.  The characters have arrive in the port of Zabhela aboard an Argossean merchant ship.  The ruling class in of Kush are hiding their daughters in fear of the servants of the ape god Jullah.  The player's investigation will soon put them in confrontation with a band of assassins and in search of a treasure map.<br /><br />In \\"Ruins of Atlaia\\" the players find themselves captured by Tibu slavers and then manage to escape when the slavers are raided by a more dangerous rival clan of warriors.  On the run they find themselves surrounded by enemies in a dangerous until they find aid from a princess who leads them to the Temple of Olorin.  Finally, in \\"Red Citadel\\" the players will find themselves in pursuit of the assassins of the Scarlet Hand and the scepter that was stolen from them in the previous adventure and a final face off with the forces behind the trouble in the black kingdoms.<br /><br />Those unfamiliar with Robert E. Howard's Hyborian realms should know that this was not a typical D&D type universe where there are loads of monsters and magic items to be found.  Most of the foes the players face will be human long with some various animal beasts.  But the campaign has a very strong Howard feel to it.  It has that dense, tautly written flavor of a Howard story and the adventure will keep even the most seasoned player on their toes as they venture through this very strange and dangerous new territory.  It's an adventure that should be run by an experienced DM that is familiar with Conan and Howard's stories to really capture the proper mood and setting.  The players will find more than enough challenges in this adventure.  I'd recommend going on the high side of the suggested PC level and having six PCs total.  A diversified group will work best but you'll want to have at least 3 good fighters whether they are straight fighters or multi-classed.<br /><br />All in all a very enjoyable adventure and another winner from Mongoose!amiliar with Conan and Howard's stories to really capture the proper mood and setting.

I get to read a lot of graphic novels...a lot of super hero stuff, lots of action and horror, a lot of drama, but you see much good humor in comics today.  Humor is hard to do to and the best humor is generally found in strip art collections. Aaron Williams' Nodwick Chronicles is one of the funniest books I've read in a long time.  First, it involves a past-time very near and dear to my heart...role-playing!  I began playing Dungeons & Dragons back in 1979 and always enjoyed the Dragon Mirth section of Dragon Magazine.  That's where Nodwick and his companions first got their start in the 1980's and they've been going strong ever since.<br /><br />The Nodwick Chronicles Vol. 3 collects issues #13 - 18 of the series featuring Artax the wizard, Yeagar the warrior, Piffany the cleric, and the ever put-upon henchman Nodwick.  This is some of the funniest stuff to do with Dungeons & Dragons since TSR gave us \\"Expedition to the Barrier Peaks\\" some 25 years ago.  I'm sure that's a joke that about six people will actually get...<br /><br />This book starts out with \\"Chains of Love\\" where Nodwick and the gang decide to hold a yard sale to get rid of some of the booty that's built up over the years of adventuring.  Piffany, while running a lemonade stand, falls victim to a Micky Finn love potion and goes ga-ga for Nodwick.<br /><br />In \\"Landlords of the Realm\\", the group is informed by their lending agent from \\"Century 13\\" real estate, that their dungeon---The Hollow of Hazardous Horror---has fallen below the required level of evil for the district and unless they can bring their evil quotient up, the dungeon will be foreclosed on and 75% the groups future treasure will have to be turned over.  Seems Piffany made nice with the resident monsters and now they're making arts and crafts and growing gourmet mushrooms.<br /><br />The next three stories is one long epic in which Yeagar competes in a jousting tournament riding in a Knightanic tank powered by Nodwick who has to do the pedaling.  Yeagar's prize for winning is a powerful artifact called the Gauntlet of Supremacy.  But the item is cursed and Artax, Piffany and Nodwick have to find a way to free Yeagar from the gauntlet which includes a hilarious romp through the fighter's somewhat simple mind.<br /><br />\\"Once Upon a Time\\" is Aaron Williams' take on popular fairy tales such as Pinocchio, Jack and the Bean Stalk, and Hansel & Gretel, with his intrepid foursome in the various starring roles.<br /><br />Aaron Williams has a very clean and polished cartooning style.  His humor runs from the juvenile pranks and shortcomings of Yeagar, to the biting sarcasm of poor Nodwick who is always on the short end of the stick.  The stories are all well paced and balanced with dungeon-crawling action and humor.  Dungeon & Dragon fans will love Nodwick but I think it holds special appeal to long-time fans who remember the good ol' pre-D20 days.  If you can find it...and Amazon doesn't have it for sale, pick up the Nodwick Adventure Log which is a collection of the earliest Nodwick strips from Dragon Magazine.  You can pick it up from the Dork Storm Press website if you do a search.  I highly recommend both books.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonto do the pedaling.

On the other hand, at certain points you want to just yell, \\"Snap out of it!\\"  We've all lost loved ones and we all deal with uncertainty in this new world of global terrorism.  Still, Nace provides readers with an intimate look into his life and his soul in what amounts to his life story told in a scratchy, minimalist style that wavers from crudely child-like to darkly beautiful.<br /><br />Nace relates his story of growing up in New Mexico and having to take care of his ailing father while his mother worked long hours to provide for the family.  One line stands as a powerful statement about the book when he says, referring to his father, \\"He died...I kept living.\\"  The line is stated almost apologetically and without the least bit of optimism about life going forward.  It's a tragic line in the most classical sense.<br /><br />After his father's death Nace loses himself into drugs and alcohol as he is unable to cope with life, and especially unable to carry on relationships with women.  Nace would eventually end up in New York City in an attempt to at once lose himself, and yet find some meaning in life.  Nace finally finds love and eventually becomes a father but questions the wisdom of bringing a child into this world.  By the end of the tale, or maybe it's really the beginning, Nace has resigned himself to what we all eventually do, and that is that life is what you make of it.  Nace it seems as finally found peace and come to terms with his own life.<br /><br />Nace's story isn't all that uncommon, but the fact that he shares it so intimately with us makes it a powerful tale.  It's not for everyone.  It's definitely not for those who think comics begin and end with the sludge put out by certain companies.  It is small press at its finest, however.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson	2005-07-11

Now comic hype was nowhere near what it is today.  There was no internet...no magazines like Wizard, and yet the news of Kirby returning to Captain America was highly anticipated, even by a 13 year old kid like me!  Heck, anything had to be better than the art of Frank Robbins who had been doing Cap for sometime Prior to Kirby's return.  I believe Kirby made his return around issue #194, as Steve Rogers, who had quit being Captain America to become Nomad, once again donned the red, white, and blue to battle the Red Skull.<br /><br />This run of Kirby, and specifically the issues in this book have very much the look and feel of Kirby's great work of the 1960's from Tales of Suspense.  They only problem was that this was no longer the mid-1960's it was now the mid-1970's.  Younger, hotter artists had first begun to really push the industry in the early 1970's.  Guys like Neal Adams, Jim Steranko, Mike Kaluta, and others had ushered in a new era of gritty realism in comic art, and Steranko had done it on Captain America, albeit in a very limited run.  And by this time John Buscema had really become the house artist at Marvel who others followed after, just as Kirby had been in the 1960's.<br /><br />These Captain America stories have that 60's innocence about them and for nostalgia buffs and fans of Kirby, they will no doubt enjoy this book.  But while I am a big Kirby fan there's no doubt that some of his dynamics were a bit lacking by this time.  Still, it was great to see Kirby on Cap again after so many years.	2005-07-11

When I began reading comics in the early 1970's most other eleven and twelve year-olds were just reading comics for the characters but I always was captivated by superior artists since I was an aspiring artist myself.  Guys like Neal Adams, Barry Smith, George Perez, Jim Starlin, Berni Wrightson...and Frank Brunner.  Brunner, I always found to be the most enigmatic out of all of these artists because while the rest have remained active or semi-active in comics...Adams even had his own company for a time...Brunner seemed to virtually disappear from the comic book landscape after the 1970's.<br /><br />With an introduction by Michael Moorcock, this book from Vanguard Productions features a glorious sampling of Brunner's art from the late 1960's through present day.  Throughout, Brunner shares anecdotes about his career in comics and after comics and catches us up with what he is doing today.  Much of this information was new to me such as Frank's initial desire to want to work in underground comics as opposed to mainstream books and his early days working for Warren Publications.<br /><br />Like many, however, it was his work on Doctor Strange that first made me a Brunner Fan.  Doc Strange has always had the benefit for having superior artists do to the unique milieus the book features.  Guys like Steve Ditko, Gene Colan, Paul Smith...all talented but it was Brunner's vision of the Sorcerer Supreme that I will always remember.  Great covers like  Doctor Strange #1 and #4 still are among my favorites, as well as the memorable Howard the Duck #1.  And then there are the stories with Death and, of course, GOD!  Brunner relates an interesting story about that rather famous issue when Stan Lee told Brunner and writer Steve Englehart that they needed to print a retraction saying it wasn't THE God but rather A God!  Their resolution is quite hilarious.<br /><br />Like many great artists of the 1970's, Brunner doesn't hesitate to show his disdain for many of today's splash-page heavy, techno artists and the lifeless, unoriginal characters which permeate comics.  I've heard similar comics from both Neal Adams and John Buscema.  Eyes of light not only reprints a lot of his great comic art of the 1970's but also work from his classic portfolios like his modern take on Alice in Wonderland.  There's also a lot of great new work, some commissions for classic Brunner renditions of Doctor Strange and Red Sonja.<br /><br />Brunner covers much of what he did after leaving Marvel including his work in TV, film, and animation of projects such as Pirates of Dark Water, Dino Riders, Skeleton Warriors, Jonny Quest, Robocop, The Ed Grimly Show, and much more.  It's truly a fascinating and intimate look at one of the legends of illustration and highly recommended.

On tap for this third volume are artists such as Pelaez. John Bosco, Arantza, Diego Candia, David Pugliese, German Ponce, and many more.  The drawings are rendered primarily in pencils and pen and ink.  We start with a fabulously erotic cover by Pelaez featuring a beautiful topless witch, flying upon her broomstick.<br /><br />From there it's 64 pages of dazzling, erotic art.  While there is too many to list, here are some of my most favorite pieces in the book:<br /><br />Diego Greco pencils a lovely voodoo priestess featuring subtle shading effects.  She sits posed with a voodoo doll with a pair of very large pins poking out of it.<br /><br />Arantza has a gorgeous blonde, dressed in a lace teddy and with a Red Riding Hood type cloak.  She's posed with her back to the viewer, looking over her left shoulder in a Betty Grable-like fashion, holding a black panther on a leash.  Very provocative and sexy!<br /><br />Amilon Santos provides a magnificently detailed backdrop to his quartet of witches.  One rides atop her broom, and another holds a crystal ball proudly while the final pair hover over a steaming cauldron, all smiling enthusiastically as if they have a deep secret.<br /><br />John Bosco has one of my most favorite pieces in the book.  An awesome drawing of three witches flying atop their broomsticks while an ancient, Carpathian-like castle sets in the gloomy mountain background with dozens of bats silhouetted against the moon.<br /><br />German Ponce contributes a powerful sorceress calling forth a massive demon while a nude sacrifice struggles hopelessly against her chains.<br /><br />I really love the pieces by Pelaez and Arantza the most, though.  Pelaez' women have a classical, almost art deco period look to them with their captivating eyes and flowing hair.  They remind me of old 20's and 30's Halloween postcards of witches in traditional pointed hats and brooms.  Arantza quite simply draws some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.  This was the first book in this series that I've had the pleasure to see and I highly recommend it for fans of erotic and pinup art.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansontches in traditional pointed hats and brooms.

Written by Mr. Sci-Fi himself, Forrest Ackerman, along with Brad Linaweaver this is a dazzling look into the past at the wonderful art of the 20's through the 50's that graced the covers of those early sci-fi books and pulps such as Amazing Stories, Startling Stories, Astounding Stories, Galaxy, and many more.  No one knows Sci-Fi like Uncle Forry and many credit him with coining that term in the first place. It was the very first issue of Amazing Stories that inspired Ackerman's life-long love of the genre and set him on his pace to accrue one of the most fabulous collections of memorabilia ever assembled.<br /><br />The book reprints hundreds of these classic pulp and book covers along with running anecdotes from both Ackerman and Linaweaver.  We look back at these great covers and discover just how visionary the artists were sixty plus years ago.  Their works had a perhaps over-spectacular flair to them, but they foreshadowed much of the technology we use today like computers, cell phones, atomic power, spacecraft, and robots.  Frank R. Paul was the first star of pulp art as his work graced many covers of Hugo Gernsback's amazing stories and now sells for thousands of dollars today.<br /><br />Each chapter takes on a different subject such as chapter two's look at space travel with all manner of fantastic rockets, and ships and saucers.  It's interesting to see how designs changed from the earliest pulps of the 20's to the 1950's when actual space programs were able to provide inspiration to the artists.  One can even see our present day space shuttles in the works of these early talents.<br /><br />Chapter three covers robots and again these covers don't disappoint as they imagine robot designs both functional and sublime.  There are humanoid robots, insectoid robots, even robots that look incredibly like the Transformer robots so popular today.  One great cover to Galaxy from September 1954, shows a scientist working on a female android who looks entirely human, but with her skin peeled away over one arm and shoulder showing her internal circuitry, inspiring views of The Terminator, some thirty years before that film came out.<br /><br />It is then interesting to see how when we move to the 1950's, aliens become the one of the main subjects for covers.  With no limits but their own imaginations we are treated to a veritable treasure trove of scaly, hairy, slithering beasts and it's clear that many of the \\"B\\" filmmakers of the 1950's used the pulps as their inspiration in creating their latex monsters.<br /><br />It's truly a magnificent book and I was especially captivated by the covers of the old Sci-Fi novels as you so rarely encounter them these days.  A must have for Sci-fi collectors and fans!  And as a side note, this book, like all of the Collector's Press books are well made using thick, coated stock, heavy covers and bound beautifully with the collector in mind.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonlar today.

The cover featured Conan battling a winged gargoyle, high above a city, while the gargoyle also held a comely wench.  That book would begin a life-long love affair that I would have with the art of John Buscema.  In today's comic scene where it seems all the artists can do is produce splash pages of abnormally large-breasted women, Buscema's art displays the qualities of a true master storyteller.<br /><br />Vanguard Productions has released this wonderful sketchbook of Buscema's art, another in their outstanding series of sketchbooks featuring some of the all-time great comic book artists.  With an introduction by the legendary illustrator Jim Steranko, and a book-length interview with J. David Spurlock, we learn of Buscema's early career as he was hired by a young Stan Lee at the then Timely comics.  He would work on a freelance basis for Timely/Atlas and also work for other comic publishers, notably Western doing books such as \\"Roy Rogers\\" and \\"Indian Chief\\".  Buscema would leave the comic business in the late 50's and move into advertising until a call from Stan Lee brought him back to Marvel for good in 1966.  And we can all be thankful that Stan made that call.  While Jack Kirby clearly set the tone and style of Marvel art of the 1960's, it was Buscema who took the reins in the 1970's, developing a different style than Kirby's, but no less dynamic.  Ironically, John initially had trouble grasping the Marvel style when he returned until Stan gave him a number of Kirby titles to look over.  Buscema would even go on to write the bible of Marvel art \\"How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way\\" which is still widely read over 25 years later.<br /><br />John would go on to do many titles at Marvel over the years including a long stint on the Avengers where he would create the look of the android Vision for the classic Avengers #57.  He also worked on Thor, The Silver Surfer, and countless others, but it was his work on Conan that captivated me.  No artist, not even Frazetta (whom Buscema acknowledges as THE Conan artist) ever captured the true essence of the grim, brooding warrior of Robert E. Howard like Buscema did.  Buscema reveals how he took over Conan after Barry Smith left and barely can contain his disdain for Smith's youthful, slender version of Conan.  He would draw Conan in both the color comic, and the B&W Savage Sword of Conan magazine for some 25 years.<br /><br />This wonderful book is loaded with sketches, some finished some just rough layouts, from throughout his illustrious career.  Buscema's women are not the pencil-thin waits, giant bosoms of today's comics, but REAL women; sensuous, often buxom and with his trademark pouty lips.  Buscema's characters were real characters.  His expertise at drawing anatomy and movement correctly almost a lost art in today's splash page heavy, \\"in your face\\" style of art.  There's a wonderful story John tells during the interview about how Stan Lee criticized John's art on the now celebrated Silver Surfer #4, featuring one of the greatest covers in history.  Years later, Stan would tell John that it was their best work together and he never recalled his earlier comments.  You gotta love ol' Stan!<br /><br />Buscema is a true comic hero of mine and a man who left us all too soon.  His works will live on however and be continued to be loved and appreciated for generations to com.

Scott Mills' self-described minimalist style and artful use of zip-a-tone blend for a unique cartooning style, at once rough around the edges and yet appropriate for the subject matter.  \\"My own Little Empire\\" is a 90's story of directionless teens from Mills' own experiences.  Pete, Roger, Paul, Roop, Kevin, Joey, Seth and a few others do what teens do:  dick around in cars, hang out at the mall for no early reason, attend concerts, and goof off in school.<br /><br />I'm not sure there's an age barrier here.  I knew guys like this when I was in high school in the late 70's and I think most can relate to the issues touched on.  The central theme is Joey's unrequited love for Jackie and her seeming willingness to return the affection, but doesn't want to her current boyfriend, Rupert.  Likewise, Joey's afraid the massive Roop will pound him if he finds out.  We all probably had a similar unrequited love in your own high school experiences.<br /><br />The strips range from the sadness of Joey's love for Jackie to the outrageous as Joey, Roger, and Pete all try acid and Joey suddenly remembers he was supposed to inventory and re-organize the store where he works, with predictably disastrous results.  Couple the acid induced paranoia with a road trip to an old, abandoned hospital, and Scott Mills takes readers on quite a ride.  It harkens me back to when I was in college and there was an abandoned mental facility with tunnels underground that we used to stupidly frequent and party in.  Scott delivered a blow of deja-vu there!  I found myself liking this book much more than I thought I would.  It's as simplistic as can be yet its themes hit the mark dead on target.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson	2005-07-07

Argosy would premiere as the first true pulp back in 1896 and before long dozens of competitors would emerge such as Popular Magazine, All-Story Weekly, New Story and so many more.  Street & Smith, long a major publisher of dime novels would convert their Nick Carter series into Detective Story Magazine in 1915.  The pulps were born!<br /><br />Early on, adventure pulps were the most popular as they transported readers to strange and exotic lands in a time when few would ever leave their own state.  It's where we first read the exploits of Tarzan, and heard the names of writers such as Burroughs, Mundy and Rohmer.  Adventure magazine was among the most popular of those early days and they even had their own organization you could join called \\"The Legion\\" which would one day evolve into the American Legion.  Adventure printed more than just fiction, they had many regular columns including \\"Wanted: Men & Adventurers\\" where real life mercenaries could advertise their skills for hire.<br /><br />In the 1930's, detective pulps became the most popular as there were literally dozens of detective pulps being published.  Among the most prominent pulps of the day was Black Mask Magazine, started by prominent newspaperman and political commentator H.L. Mencken.  But he considered the pulps so low-brow that he didn't want his name associated with them.  Still, Blackmask was a breeding ground for some for some of the great mystery and detective writers ever to pen a story including Dashiell Hammett, Erle Stanley Gardner, Lester Dent, and Raymond Chandler.<br /><br />Robinson's narrative moves from one pulp genre to the next, with a short, but concise history of each. He examines the Western pulps and the interesting history of the man known as Max Brand.  Brand was the most prolific pulp writer ever, appearing in 622 issues of Western Story magazine from 1920 - 1935.  From there it's on to the hero pulps and the birth of the most famous pulp characters of all including \\"The Shadow\\", \\"Doc Savage\\", and \\"The Spider\\".  The Shadow's covers were always among the most evocative and terrifying, especially those by the great George Rozen.<br /><br />But the genre that gave us the most outrageous and grisly covers of the pulp era belongs to the \\"shudder pulps\\".  Bondage, torture, sadism, nudity...nothing was held back in covers for such pulps as \\"Terror Tales\\" and \\"Horror Stories\\".  These pulps are some of the most sought after today by collectors.<br /><br />Romance, spicy adventures, sports, war...all of these get their just do in Pulp Culture but it's the sci-fi and fantasy section that will be a major appeal for many fans.  It was here where some of the most famous and long-running pulps made their mark.  Hugo Gernsback would usher in the age of Sci-fi pulps in 1926 with Amazing Stories.  Soon there were dozens of competitors including Wonder Stories, Astounding Stories, and many more.  And then there is perhaps the most famous, most collectible of all pulps, Weird Tales.  Weird Tales would unleash the enormous talents of Robert E. Howard, H.P. Lovecraft, Robert Bloch, August Derleth, and countless others with stories that would endure, and continue to be reprinted, decades after their original publication.  There are dozens of covers provided featuring the works of artists like Margaret Brundage and Virgil Finlay.<br /><br />Robinson closes his book by providing an appendix to a handful of pulp dealers and notes on pulp values.  This bookwould be worth the $40 price tag alone JUST for the hundreds of stunning covers re-printed, but Robinson's concise history of pulps just adds to the luster of the book.  Simply a magnificent book for any fan or collector of pulp magazines.<br /><br />Reviewed By Tim Jansonalues.

One thing I'm sorry I missed out on by not being born about 10 years earlier is the fun and excitement of the family road trip and the wonderful, strange, and Kitschy roadside attractions so popular in the 50's and 60's.  In this small but fun book, author Andrew F. Wood takes readers on a state-by-state journey to some of the weirdest and wackiest attractions one can find traveling the highways of America.  As Wood points out, many of these are kept alive only by the love of their owners, long after their heyday has passed.  The book is arranged in alphabetical order by state and in addition to noting some of these attractions, each state also has a \\"Did you know\\" fun little fact or bit of trivia about it.<br /><br />Wood's book is not meant to be a complete guide to all roadside attractions, but rather a nation-wide sampling of some of the zanier things to see as you visit each state.  Some notable stops along the way include:<br /><br />Holbrook, AZ where you can find one of the last remaining teepee motels called the Wigwam Motel, along the famous Route 66.<br /><br />Giant statues have long been popular attractions for motorists and this book lists many interesting ones to see including one of comic strip hero Steve Canyon along I-70 in Colorado.  Or in Collinsville, Illinois, you can see the world's largest Catsup bottle.<br /><br />In Dyersville, Iowa, you can visit the baseball field made famous in the film, \\"Field of Dreams\\" or visit the home of Bufford Pusser in Adamsville, TN, who was immortalized in the 1970's cult classic, \\"Walking Tall\\".<br /><br />For those who like their attractions a bit spookier, there is the Voodoo Museum in New Orleans' famous French Quarter, and you can get your picture taken in an authentic gas chamber at the Wyoming Frontier Prison Museum.<br /><br />Michigan features Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum and Cawker City Minnesota is home to the world's largest ball of twine, at a massive 40' feet tall.<br /><br />The book is loaded with fast food firsts, such as the locations of the first KFC, Wendy's, White Castle, and more as well as numerous tiny towns...even a tiny world...that can be visited.  This is a fun, fascinating trip through America that many of us never see and that is quickly disappearing from the landscape.  It's obvious that Andrew Wood has a tremendous passion for the subject matter.

This latest supplement for Dungeons & Dragons or D20 is designed with  the players in mind and features everything you need to know to create a PC for play in the rich and lively world of Kalamar.<br /><br />You begin your character creation by selecting your race, of course but also selecting your race from numerous human types as well, all which come with their unique traits and characteristics including languages, physical make-up, etc.  Even within the demi-humans there are other variants such as Hill, Mountain, and Stone Dwarves, Rock and Forest Gnomes, Half-Hobgoblins, etc.<br /><br />From race we move to class selection and all of the various standard classes are presented along with variants such as the bard variant the Basiran Dancer, Brigands, Gladiators, Infiltrators, Shamans, and Spellsingers.  Of course you can't have a D&D supplement today without new Prestige classes and the Kalamar Player's Guide doesn't disappoint with eleven new prestige classes including:  Bounty Hunter, Golem Master, Muse, Mariner, Restorer, and Warlord.  In addition there are neat little fighting schools that come with packages of skills and feats your character can obtain through level progression.<br /><br />Speaking of feats and skills there are dozens of new ones to choose from and the back has an appendix listing all skills and feats from this book as well as the other D&D sources.  New feats include such interesting and useful abilities as elemental adept, fast healer, sense danger, and spell dodge.<br /><br />There's lots of new spells to choose from for all the spell-casting classes as well as new magic items and even some new artifacts as well.  As with all the other Kalamar books, the Players guide is well-written and illustrated in a nicely bound, very heavy and durable hardcover book.  Kalamar is a well-constructed, rich world.  The writers and editors present the information in straight-forward format with lots of appendices to help the DM and player out.

This massive supplement is actually larger than the actual Call of Cthulhu game book, which should give you some idea of just how thorough and comprehensive it is.  It covers virtually everything that the original book did but slanted towards play in Japan.  Author Michael Dziesinski begins with an introduction to Japan, its people and culture.  It's this milieu which makes it unique from the original game which while providing information for playing in the modern day, was still heavily slanted towards play in the 1920's.<br /><br />All aspects are revisited including character creation, occupations, which include many new ones such as Bushido \\"The Way of the Warrior\\" which certainly gives some punch, or kick, to PC's.  There's also many new skills, magic, and of course, being in a modern setting, weapons and vehicles to utilize.  Dziesinski goes so far as to provide the scope on how PCs find themselves in Japan to begin their investigations, assuming you're not using characters born and raised there.  This is an interesting approach as you do become a stranger in a strange land, which certainly adds even more mystery to the game.<br /><br />There are lengthy sections on religions and cults and other shadowy organizations and how they all interact with the Cthulhu Mythos.  It's very well thought out and harkens back to yellow menace pulps of the 30's and 40's.  Several new monsters, elder gods, great old ones, etc, are included.  In addition, there are new, complete adventures included as well as a couple of dozen adventure hooks and ideas that the Keeper can build on.  The depth and scope is quite staggering.  That is the book's greatest strength and perhaps its greatest pitfall.  There's a LOT to try and absorb and you have to wonder if players are going to want to invest the time to learn this new setting.  There are great ideas here and it's certainly possible to run a campaign using just the ideas that fit you and your players, and adding more detail as you go along.<br /><br />Ultimately it will be up to the Keeper to decide how much to use.  There's no shortage of source material, that's for sure.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson.

I had never even heard of this movie until just recently when I noticed it playing late one night on TCM.  I decided to tape this oddball sounding film and wasn't disappointed.  Little Timmy is the son of a scientist who is working on a powerful supercomputer.  Basically his dad just wants Timmy to stop bothering him.  Timmy finds a disassempled Robby in a storage room that his dad said came from the future!  Huh?  No explanation there, but could it be the same future of Forbidden planet since Cyril Hume who wrote this story also did the screenplay for that sci-fi classic?  Anyhow Timmy puts the Robot togehther and the robot soon comes under the influence of the powerful supercomputer and sends him off to try an steal an experimental.  Like I said, it's all pretty hokey and there's plenty of holes in the plot.  Were left to accept to much on faith.  But all in all it wasn't a bad film.  It's always cool to discover little gems like this.  Thanks TCM!	2005-06-30

These were not comics you could buy in a comic store, but rather they were mini or digest-sized comics put out by some very talented--and some not so talented-artists and writers who were doing it for the pure love of creating comics.  Unfortunately for them, there were not companies around like Alternative Comics or Top Shelf to give these talents an outlet of distribution for their work.<br /><br />\\"Stickleback\\" reminds me so much of those small press days.  The art style is raw, maybe even a bit crude, yet oddly appropriate for the subject matter.  George Stickleback is obsessed with his art.  His art happens to be making figures out of toilet paper and as the book opens he's struggling to get the creative juices flowing to get his figures done for a show.  George stares intently at his little figures.  You can hear the wheels grinding in his head as he agonizes over the minutest details.  To make matters worse are the interruptions.  First his cat Patty tears some of his figures up then the phone rings as George's pay Yanni begs him to pickup the phone.  Gritting his teeth, George answers.  He can't spare the time but when Yanni pleads with him, he agrees to take the bus across town to meet him at a caf&eacute; for a glass of lemonade.  At the caf&eacute; George is accosted by a group of rowdy, beatnik-looking types before sitting down with his friend.  From there we meet Yanni with his out of control fingernail and George is soon involved in a war of words with the beatniks that culminates literally into a pissing match.<br /><br />Stickleback had me laughing out loud at several points.  We all know an obsessive compulsive person like George who worries about mundane details.  Graham Annable captures the spirit of small press with a story that took shape out of life's everyday experiences.  Check out the backgrounds in his panels.  His little toilet paper figures crowd his apartment, almost coming to life as they are posed in various positions, one reaching down from a counter to help pull his comrade up.

Set within the spectacular city of Jewde (or Judoh in the Anime version), Daisuke Aurora and his android partner Heat Guy J battle crime as agents for the Special Services, supervised by Daisuke's older brother.  This Manga actually contains four separate, self-contained stories.<br /><br />In the opener \\"City Guy\\" a member of the Solloso crime family, found to be dealing in illegal tobacco is found dead as Daisuke investigates.  He soon finds himself confronted by the killer, a rogue android that is outlawed in Jewde.  The Android knows of heat Guy J and wants Daisuke to call him out for a confrontation.  Daisuke refuses and the android attacks, finally getting J to appear for battle.<br /><br />In \\"Rumor Bomb\\"  Daisuke is given the rather dull assignment of trying to track down the maker of the \\"Angel Diva\\" trading cards.  The cards are being produced without the knowledge of the women shown on them and sold into the black market, making them a hot collectible.  A far more interesting case is that of the serial bomber who has already struck several targets in Jewde, but that is being handled by the regular law enforcement until Daisuke and J find themselves caught up in the twisted plot of both crimes.<br /><br />\\"Beast Party\\" finds J and Daisuke attending a swanky, pool part at a hotel owned by the head of the Wei crime family.  A beautiful and buxom party guest who throws herself at the mob boss turns out to be an android assassin and Heat Guy J soon finds himself in battle with the gorgeous machine.<br /><br />The last, and best story of the group is \\"Steel City\\".  J and Daisuke are attending the Jewde robot expo after hearing rumors that a powerful android named Grendel plans to attack the show.  The pair are led into a trap and find themselves facing a massive mecha.  But all this was just a diversion as the new head of the Leonelli family sends the powerful Grendel in to kill both J and Daisuke...and J is in shut down mode to cool off from his last battle.  Can Daisuke survive in time until J reboots?<br /><br />This was one of the best Manga's I've ever read.  The interplay between the over-eager yet lazy Daisuke and the stoic, dedicated J make for great reading as J constantly has to remind Daisuke about their responsibilities.  The dialog throughout is zippy, and tinged with hilarious sarcasm. Kyoko, the Special Services secretary is in a constant battle with Daisuke to get his reports filed on time as well as fighting with him over his bullet limit.  At it's core Heat Guy J is a traditional buddy cop show, it's just that one of the buddies is a steam-powered Android.  The series was created by Kazuki Akane and features excellent artwork by Chiaki Ogishima.

All we ever hear about is the bad things about the church.  The revisionist history about the Crusades and such and it's nice for someone to finally be pointing out all of the positives.  Thomas Woods shows in utter clarity the tremendous influence that the Catholic Church had on the development of governments, law, educational institutions, art, medicine, science, and even economics.  The Catholic church was fundamental in moving Western Europe out of the dark ages and into civilized times as opposed to the opposite which so many new generation historians nutcases would have you believe.  It was the Catholic church which made education available to the general populace, instead of merely being for the wealthy.<br /><br />One cannot discount those men and women who have devoted their lives into the service of the church in order to educate our children.  Here in the Detroit area, where the Archdiocese of Detroit just announced the closings of many Catholic schools, those kids and parents are out in protest, trying to raise money to keep them open.  They know full well the superior education that their kids receive there versus the public schools.  One need also only look at the many outstanding Catholic Hospitals, such as the one where not only was I born, but my second son was born as well.  Far better than the cold, uncaring ciry hospital where my first child was born.<br /><br />Thomas Woods decisively gives the church its long overdue props.  Grat book!	2005-06-28

That is certainly a part of it and it gives hope to people battling that dread disease.  But what is really inspirational is his incredible drive to succeed.  Drive?  No, drive is not the correct word.  Rather what comes through in this book is Armstrong's obsession to succeed.  As Armstrong prepares to try an win his sixth straight Tour de France, Author Daniel Coyle gives us a look into what makes Armstrong tick.  If anything, the fact that he's won five straight times already even seems to drive him more because of the detractors who think he can't do it.  He's older now, competing in a rigorous event that totally taxes the body and yet tell Armstrong he can't do it only seems to make him more determined.<br /><br />Coyle shadowed Armstrong throughout his training and preparation for the 1994 Tour de France to give the world insight into a guy who despite his success, is still largely unknown to the world at large.  We think of Armstrong for this one period of the year and then he disappears from our thoughts until the next race.  Coyle also brilliantly focuses the spotlight on some of Armstrong's chief rivals so we can try and view him through their eyes, and what the feel about this man.  It's quite a fascinating story, and most of it all new to me.	2005-06-28

Will someone really make a movie?  Time will tell.  This totally fresh sci-fi 'western' really changed the genre.  There were no aliens, no missions to boldy go where no one had gone before...just a rag tag group of rogues aboard the Firefly, meting out an existence however they could.<br /><br />You need only look at this book to see how much this show influenced people.  Inside are essays about the show written by some of the cast members as well as some of the greats of sci-fi and fantasy literature including:  David Gerrold, Lawrence Watt-Evans, Nancy Holder, Tanya Huff, and Mercedes Lackey.  The introduction is by Jane Espenson who is a long-time collaborator with Joss Whedon both on Firefly and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br /><br />It's interesting to read the various takes that these diverse people have on the series.  They're clearly fans.  I especially enjoyed the essay by David Gerrold since I'm a big fan of his work.  His inevitable comparison to Star Trek was fascinating. All in all it was an interesting read on a show that ended much too soon and a real must-have for fans of the show.	2005-06-28

Throughout the 90's, TOPPS comics put out a truly outstanding comic book series based on the hit TV show the X-Files.  They began collecting the issues in trade paperback format but only got as far as issue #12.  Now, Checker Books has picked up the ball and is continuing collecting these classic issues in trade paperback.  This first volume collects issues #13 - 19, as well as the special issue #0.  TOPPS' greatest accomplishment with the series was being able to capture the spirit of the TV shows with witty writing and art that matched the spirit of each tale.<br /><br />In \\"One Player Only\\" Scully & Mulder investigate the murder of a team of computer programmer's by that team's leader.  Could it be possible that the artificial intelligence program they were working on actually possessed the team leader?<br /><br />\\"Falling\\" finds Mulder in the wilderness investigating the crash sight of an unknown ship.  When he's caught in a trap by some children, they're convinced that Mulder is himself an alien.  Mulder is slowly poisoned by radiation while Scully is stone-walled in her own investigation.<br /><br />\\"Home of the Brave\\" is a two-part story that finds Mulder and Scully captured by survivalist extremists in the swamps of Georgia.  They plan to kill the two agents but something even more sinister than government agents is lurking in the swamps.<br /><br />In \\"Thin Air\\" a man washes up on the shores of Greece, claiming to be a member of the ill-fated Flight 19 that disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle over fifty years earlier.  Mulder & Scully doubt the man's story and soon uncover the hoax.  But why did someone go through all the trouble to fake the man's identity.  And why did that man soon disappear?<br /><br />\\"Squeeze\\" adapts one of the more famous TV episodes about a serial killer who seems to strike every 30 years, tearing the livers out of five victims before disappearing again.  This is a great story, adapted by Roy Thomas and Val Mayerick.<br /><br />\\"Zero\\" is an adaptation of the X-Files pilot episode by Roy Thomas and John Van Fleet.  This story tells the tale of how Scully was assigned to the X-files and her first meeting and case with Mulder as the investigate a series of murders in Oregon.<br /><br />All of the stories in this volume are very good but as far as the original stories, \\"Thin Air\\" really does the best job of capturing that feeling of shady conspiracies that the show was so well-known for.  It's little surprise, then, when you see who is behind it all in the end.  The art ranges from above average to outstanding, especially the work of Val Mayerick who is one of my favorites.  If you've been missing X-files since the comic ended or never read it, these collections from Checker books are a great place to start.  Most of the stories are all self contained and you needn't worry about having read the previous issues in order to jump right in.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson<br />\\"Zero\\" is an adaptation of the X-Files pilot episode by Roy Thomas and John Van Fleet.

Batman Begins is the start of a new Batman franchise and the start of a massive marketing campaign.  The Art of Batman Begins takes you through a kind of step-by-step tour of the creation of the film and it's dark influences.  The book begins with the cover to the classic Detective Comics #27, the first ever appearance of Batman along with a few panels from that issue by the late Bob Kane, Batman's creator.  Then it's on to brilliant, full page concept paintings and drawings, and storyboards.  A veritable treasure trove of material.  If you haven't seen the film yet, this book is a great example of how Batman is being returned to his dark roots of the late 1930's and early 40's.  A great book...one of the best merchandising items so far for the movie.  Must-have for collectors!	2005-06-27

He can't articulate the language, what makes me think he knows what he's talking about regarding Batman Begins?  With  any big budget blockbuster comes the inevitable parade of merchandise. Few films other than Star Wars can match the marketing juggernaut of the Batman films.  Batman Begins is the long awaited beginning to a new series of Batman films, revived back to life after Joel Schumacher and George Clooney nearly killed the franchise.  The official movie guide is a great scrapbook and companion to the film.  It features dozens of photographs from the film, absolutely brilliant photography.  There are snippets of the script as well as several short pieces detailing Batman's origins, as well as interviews.  Not just a throwaway marketing item or a piece of fluff, this is definitely a collectible you'll want to have. It's informative and entertaining.	2005-06-24

Very Big.  Guesstimates are anyone's...uh...guess as to how long it might take a party to get through this massive adventure but based on average play I'm going to say 1 to 2 years.  You could conceivably raise a party from first level to, oh gosh, I don't know...the mid teens if not higher.  Level 20 certainly would not seem out of the question I would hazzard to guess.  Each of the maps represents one section of the book, which then is obviously broken down into 16 sections.  The maps also connect to each other.  Each section has it's own background to it with its unique encounters.  It will be up to the DM to maybe establish a room as a safe haven.  Why?  Because once you get into this thing, you're basically not getting out until you're finished.  EAch section has it's hierarcy of monsters with a boss.<br /><br />Now, this presents a major challenge to both players and DMs.  is the commitment going to be there to play this thing through.  For the DM who is investing the money (and at Amazon's discount of $40.00 it really isn't that bad) he's probably not going to be to happy if his players want to opt out after awhile.  That's going to be up to the DM to allow an escape clause or not which I don't see as a problem.  There are other issues too...you found the treasure?  Gems, Jewels, golden idols?  Guess what..there's no way of getting out to sell the stuff for Gold and buying better equipment.  So as a fair DM, you'll have to maybe compomise and have the players find better armor or weapons or take them off monsters or whatever.  Delving into this huge crawl your players could, if they wanted, really hand around the beginning levels and rack up experience through exploring the entire map and random encounters.  As the DM you'll need to find a way to move them along after they've achieved sufficient level.<br /><br />There have been complaints from other reviewers that the Dungeon is boring and that many rooms are empty.  So guess what..the good DM comes up with a way of making it more exciting.  Maybe you had some more encounters and populate some of those empty rooms.  Who says this has to be played straight forward as written?  I think the designers did an admirable job of describing the dungeon and making it unique but still, with over 1600 rooms how unique can you be?<br /><br />At it's core, the World's Largest Dungeon is old-school, roleplaying...the early 80's, stay up all night eating pizza and doritos kind of hack-n-slash adventure that many RPG veterans will remember from the good ol' days when we used to say, \\"Plot?

Champions of Ruin is the newest sourcebook for Forgotten realms.  A 160 page book detailing everything you ever wanted to know about playing an evil PC.  The book introduces new races, spells, feats, and magic items.  The new races are nothing to write home about, with the best being probably the Drow/Demon halfbreed called the Draegloth.  Myself, I'm a little sick of Drow...Curse Salvatore for making them so popular and romantic!<br /><br />The feat section is pretty nice with several new and interesting feats for evil characters tapping fighters, clerics and spellcasters with some interesting feats. There are also over 30 new spells in the book.  of course the main thing that players are probably interested in is the new prestige classes.  The book has some great new prestige classes that detail how to create the class, it's various features, and advice on playing these characters.  Other chapters cover things such as evil places such as temples, shrines, etc...There's a chapter on various evil NPCs as well.<br /><br />The art is pretty good throughout and I think the book is a welcome addition to DMs and players.	2005-06-23

This wonderful book from Arcadia Publishing tells the story of Tiger Stadium through the eyes of Irwin Cohen, long-time writer and photographer in Detroit and through fantastic archival photos dating back to the beginning.  Starting as Bennett Park, we see the very roots of Tiger Stadium which began with seating for just a few thousand fans and would eventually accommodate nearly 60,000.  A newspaper article from August 30,1905 touts the debut of an exciting new young player on the Tiger's team...one Ty Cobb, who would become one of the all-time greats.  Another picture shows Cobb and rival Nap LaJoie checking out a baseball bat in 1907.<br /><br />In 1912 the name was changed to Navin Field and construction brought the seating capacity to 30,000 in 1923.  This was the era for the Tigers as such legends as Charlie Gerhinger, Sam Crawford, George Mullin, Mickey Cochran, and hank Greenberg would all make their mark on Tiger lore.  The name changed once again in 1938 to Briggs Stadium. And in 1939, Briggs Stadium would be the spot where legend Lou Gehrig would have his consecutive game streak end at 2,130 games when he took himself out of the lineup before the game started.<br /><br />In 1961 the stadium would get its last name change, this time to Tiger Stadium.  1968 was the Year of the Tiger as Detroit would erase a 3 - 1 deficit in the World Series with Mickey Lolich winning 3 games and the Tigers upset the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games to capture the world's championship.  1968 saw Denny McLain win 31 games, the last pitcher to win 30 games.  In 1971 Tiger Stadium hosted one of the most famous all-star games in history.  The American capture a rare win and the game featured home runs by six future Hall of Famers: Johnny Bench, Hank Aaron, Roberto Clemente, Frank Robinson, Harmon Killebrew, and the most famous of all...Reggie Jackson's titanic blast off the light tower above the roof of the old ball park.<br /><br />1976 Was not a great year for the team but the stadium was packed every time a young pitcher named Mark Fidrych took the mound.  Fidrych endeared himself to fans by grooming the mound on his hands and knees and talking to the baseball before he threw it.  Fidrych would win rookie of the year honors and start the all-star game.  1984 may have been the greatest ever for the Tigers and the stadium as almost three million fans would pile into the park to see the Tigers get off to a 35-5 start, the greatest in history, and go on to steamroll the Royals in the playoffs and the Padres in the World's Series.<br /><br />All good things come to an end and Tiger Stadium saw its last game on September 27, 1999.  The Tigers would win the finale and after the game, dozens of former players, some as old as their 90's were brought out before the crowd for one more tribute.  This is just a marvelous book for any Tiger or ANY baseball fan.

Joe Frontline: The Mission that Never Was, tells the story of the final Joe Team mission before the team was disbanded, and, of course, later reinstated.  The Joe team is given their final mission by the secretive, high-ranking group of Generals known as the Jugglers.  It doesn't seem like much of a Joe mission but they will carry out their orders.  They are assigned to escort a new targeting control module for a new rapid pulse particle beam weapon, from Florida to New York.  Assigned is a group consisting of Snake Eyes, Scarlett, Gung Ho, Stalker, Duke, and Hawk.  But Cobra has been able to place a spy within the Jugglers and she has placed a listening device within the hat of one of the generals and Cobra is made full-aware of the Joe's plan and their whereabouts.<br /><br />While aboard a train, the Joe's find themselves ambushed by Cobra forces, including Zartan and his Dreadnoks.  The Joes manage to fight off the ambush and escape to the Georgia coast where they commandeer a river patrol boat and hug the coast to New York.  But again Cobra is a step ahead and they are there to greet the Joes as Destro takes the module and returns to a Cobra base.  The Joes launch a mission on the base to retrieve the module, creating a diversion so Snake Eyes can get inside, using Ninja techniques to pretend he is dead.  This eventually leads to a one on one one face-off between Snake Eyes and rival Storm Shadow that even Cobra Commander cannot help but watch as the two ninjas battle blow for blow.<br /><br />This story was written by long-time Joe scribe Larry Hama with art by the always dependable Dan Jurgens.  This story reads like an old-fashioned Joe story...small wonder since Hama wrote it.  The emphasis is on action and more action, in an attempt to appeal to longtime Joe fans as Devil's Due took over the Joe title.  It's a good story but I prefer what Devil's Due has done with Joe in their more recent stories with giving these characters some much needed background and personality.  Hama keeps things pacing along but there's not much interplay between the various characters.  As a straight action story it's very good.  Dan Jurgens isn't as flashy as some of today's younger artists but he always does a solid job.  Interesting to compare this early story to the stuff that Devil's Due is doing currently.

The GI Joe team is sent to investigate consisting of Cover Girl, Spirit and Snake Eyes.  Why the Joes are investigating a kidnapping in the first place is kept as a mystery by the Jugglers, those ultra high-ranking generals who love to yank the Joe's string.  This is strictly a need-to-know basis mission and as of right now, the Joes don't need to know.  They find the boy was something of a prodigy, reading books on philosophy and drawing strange schematics in crayon.  Soon the Joes learn of another attempted abduction and discover that this autistic boy looks exactly like the one who was abducted.<br /><br />It turns out that there are several of these boys, all who have been placed with adoptive parents years earlier...they are all clones of the most fearsome Cobra villain Serpentor.  Serpentor has long been thought dead at the hands of Zartan, but Dr. Mindbender was able to make several clones, some just children, others teens, and one a full adult.  Serpentor is joined by several other renegage Cobra operatives including Firefly, Zandar, Dr. Mindbender, and others as they assualt Cobra Island and take Cobra Commander prisoner.  Soon Serpentor's forces begin attacks on major cities world wide.<br /><br />Several Joes, including Snake Eyes, have also been captured as they tried to protect the various kid-clones.  The Joes are planning a rescue mission to free their missing comrades while Cobra, now being led by Destro, put together their own mission to rescue Cobra Commander.  Destro even orders his men not to fire on any Joe member.  All-out war breaks out as Joes battle Cobra and Cobra battles Cobra, including a face-off between Cobra Commander and Serpentor!<br /><br />We really have two stories going on here; the first half of the book is, as mentioned, right out of the X-Files with the abductions of strange boys who look exactly alike and even make similar drawings.  I was waiting for Scully and Mulder to show up.  This was a very different setting for the Joe team as plain clothes investigators working with local law enforcement and I enjoyed that aspect of the story.  The second half of the book is primarily one chaotic battle as these three diverse forces meet, all with different goals in mind.  The pace is frenetic and before you know it the story was over and you were left wondering what happened.  It all climaxed a little too quickly for my tastes, especially after the very deliberate pace of the first half.  Still, it was great to see Serpentor back in action and we're all left with the fate of the kid-clones unresolved, setting the stage for a possible sequel.  As usual, the art by Tim Seeley and Brandon Badeaux was fantastic as was the colors.

We've know about all of this stuff since Clinton was still in office.  We've heard the tales from former Aide's about Hillary's relentless ambitions and nightmarish temper.  At the core we see the very type of person that the left is supposed to be against...a person who will trample over anyone to achieve power, even her own husband.  Klein shows how Bill's sexual escapades have gone on for decades yet Hillary stayed with Bill knowing he was her ticket to power.  Even once inside the White House Hillary made it top priority to keep women away from Bill and vice-versa.<br /><br />Oh but go back to the core of Hillary...her beginnings, her earlier failures at becoming class president in High School, her radical ideology changes in the 1960's and what influenced her radical feminist views, her involvement in the Watergate hearings and how that all came into play during Bill's own impeachment.  Klein also points to the failure of Hillary national health care plan as her biggest political defeat and most humiliating experience, even more humiliating than the Lewinsky scandal since this plan was all of Hillary's making. Klein believes her views were highly influenced by the culture of Lesbianism at Wellesley college in the 1960's.  Klein is on record of saying that was paramount in shaping her beliefs.  I do have a bit of a problem with what seems to be an anti-lesbianism stance from Klein on this issue but I'm not sure I can refute the claim.<br /><br />Up to present day we get a picture of a woman desperate to change the way she is viewed, both physically, politically, and in personality.  Her driving obsession to change her public image is in turn driving away former allies in the left as she tries to paint herself as a moderate democrat.  If she's a moderated Democrat then Marilyn Manson is choir boy.  Klein shows how Hillary's support of John Kerry was smoke and mirrors and only an effort to keep her own name and face in the public eye for a 2008 run at the Presidential office.  Small wonder why Kerry never embraced her support.<br /><br />For those on the left who pooh pooh the work as more right-wing propaganda consider that Klein interviewed over 100 people who know Hillary, dating back to her high school days.  This includes card-carrying Democrats.  I don't think all these people have an axes to grind with Ms. Clinton and Klein himself is an independent whose background is impeccable.p her own name and face in the public eye for a 2008 run at the Presidential office.

Ray begins his book by talking about how all the other books on BBQ all start out talking about types of grills, grill tools, charcoal etc, and he's not going to start out his that way...Bravo!  Good for him!  Because most of us ALREADY know all about tools and grills.  Insteay Lampe really wants to talk technique and taste.  As he points out...cook on whatever you have...no one need feel they can't achieve great BBQ without spending hundreds of dollars on a high end grill or BBQ pit.  Ray also tosses out the arguement of grilling vs. BBQ right off the bat and it's clear he has a bit of disdain for snooty types who think their way is the ONLY way.  Again I say Bravo!  It's this no-nonsene approach that really appealed to me about this book.  Use what you can, it's all good and it WILL be good if you follow Ray's advice.<br /><br />I've sampled a handfull of these recipes so far and here are some of my favorites:  Smoked Turkey legs...they have a Renaissance Festival here every late Summer in Michigan and my favorite thing to eat is the giant, grilled, smoked turkey legs.  I don't even like dark meat normally but these are delicious and with this recipe I can make them at home.<br /><br />I like the rib recipes but my favorite was the backyard championship Ribs.  Perfectly designed no matter what type of grill you are using.  Boneless chicken is a staple in our home and the salsa grilled chicken breasts were also a big hit.<br /><br />This book has quickly moved to the top of my list of favorites!	2005-06-22

Smoking is a technique that takes time and patience and don't expect to get things perfect the first several tries.  McPeake opens the book by discussing different types of smokers.  McPeake says bigger is not better.  I would also add that more expensive is not necessarily better either as you can achieve great results with an inexpensive water smoker.  No smoker?  No problem.  McPeake also explains how you can use your kettle grill...even your gas grill for smoking and still make great smoked BBQ.  It does work well with a gas grill once you get your technique down.  McPeake provides a list of different wood types and the tastes they will provide.  I love apple wood with chicken, it gives it a great flavor.  In additon to the techniques which I consider the most valuable section, there's chapters on meat selection, temperatures, rubs, etc.  Fully 1/2 the book is technique oriented before te 2nd half gets into some recipes.  Very good, funamental and advanced smoking book.	2005-06-22

We kind of winged it with the first but the second was tougher due to my wife being in her late 30's when she gave birth.  While the book does cover giving birth after 35, I would have liked to have seen it go into great depth regarding this subject since there are so many women now having babies into their late 30's and 40's.  My wife was also a gestational diabetic during her pregnancy with our second son, complicating matters that I wish had been covered in the book.<br /><br />That said, the book is very helpful no matter how many kids you've had already.  The information on diets alone is worth the price of the book even though her's was changed drastically due to the diabetes.  My wife wasn't working full-time during the second one so she had less back ache and foot swelling but there's great advice there about how Dad can make mom more comfortable.  The information on weight gain is especially helpful as this is often the mom-to-be's most sensitive issue to deal with.  Ultimately the chapter that men should read the most is on labor and delivery if you have any plans of being present (and you SHOULD be present!) in the delivery room to help calm your wife and do whatever you need to do to help.  I think the section on C-sections is a bit sparse so I'm glad we never had to deal with it.  And of course chapter 17 is totally devoted to fathers although most of it is about psycological issues such as dealing with moodiness, handling the delivery room, etc.<br /><br />This is still the best book of its kind!	2005-06-21

Frank Miller had just done the Dark Knight Returns a couple of years earlier and returned to Batman for this series although he turned the art chores over to Dave Mazzuchelli who produced a very noir-ish look to it, much like Miller's Sin City.  At the time I wasn't crazy about the more stylized art but I've come to appreciate it now in the 17 years since.<br /><br />As the title suggests the story revolves around Batman's troubled first year as Batman and how The death of his Parents drove Bruce Wayne to take on the Batman persona and fight crime in Gotham.  His early attempts were failures as he was thought a worse criminal than even those he sought to bring to justice.  This is not the confident, even cocky Batman we know today as he is very much trying to find his way.<br /><br />As interesting as this is, it's Miller's story involving a young cop Jim Gordon that is really enthralling and detailing his early days, going up against corrpution in the police force as well as his early relationship with Batman.  Gordon is at first assigned to bring this costumed vigilante in no matter what it takes.  The two eventually come to a meeting of the minds and Gordon would generally begin looking the other way knowing what Batman was really all about.<br /><br />Miller also takes a crack at re-defining Catwoman and putting forth the idea that it was Batman who influenced her to get out of prostitution and take up burglary as a new profession.<br /><br />The book is very dark.  Heavily inked and washed out colors.  Certainly not like many of today's blind your eyes with color comics.  This is one that still holds up well all these years later and helped cement Frank Miller as one of the greatest writers in comics.	2005-06-21

Set in the late 1920's, the scenarios can be played independently or as part of a massive campaign to halt the threat of a sinister cult who is trying to raise the city of R'Lyeh from the ocean's depth and release the Great Old Ones on the world.  The campaign is geared towards more experience players although you could take a couple of newbies along as well.<br /><br />In the first scenario, the investigators learn of the Group called the Hermetic Order of the Silver Twilight.  The group has a secret cult interior that most of its members do not even know about.  The investigators will join the Order and attempt to infiltrate its secret cult in order to discover its sinister intentions.<br /><br />In the second adventure, a new group called \\"Look to the Future\\" attempts to finance and carry out the plots of the Silver Twilight.  This adventure will result in a player or two taking a short but memorable jaunt into the future.<br /><br />Part three takes the investigators to Scotland and the town of Cannich to encounter witches and the mythical Serpent people, in search of a missing archaeologist who discovers some ancient Pictish ruins and a mysterious disk.  A tale influenced by Arthur Machen and Robert E. Howard!<br /><br />The fourth adventure finds the investigators contacted by a Hollywood millionaire who wants them to find out the source of the problems on the set of his new film.  They'll encounter ghostly images on an outtake reel and discover the sinister history of Devil's Canyon.<br /><br />From Hollywood to Portland, Maine for the next scenario as the true plots of the Silver Twilight unfold and the investigators are faced with three terrible deathtraps.<br /><br />Scenario six takes the action to one of the most mysterious places on Earth-Easter island and it's massive stone statues in what will be the most dangerous adventure yet.<br /><br />Everything climaxes in \\"The Rise of R'lyeh\\" as the investigators travel to that island, now risen from the ocean, for the final battle against the Lords of the Silver Twilight.<br /><br />In addition to these seven connected adventures, the book also provides two additional scenarios geared towards newer players.  \\"People of the Monolith\\" is based upon \\"The Black Stone\\" written by Robert E. Howard in probably his most famous Cthulhu Mythos tale.  The other scenario, \\"The Warren\\" takes the players to Boston to investigate the deserted Boucher estate and attempt to locate a friend of one of the investigators.<br /><br />While I've been role-playing for over 25 years, I'm a relative newcomer to \\"Call of Cthulhu\\".  What impresses me most is how great a job the designers do in making things easy on the GM or Keeper.  It makes no assumptions that you're already an expert and leads new Keepers like myself along with thorough information.  The inclusion of handout materials in the form of mock newspaper articles, telegrams, photos, etc, that can be copied for the players is a great touch and does a far better job of conveying the feelings of suspense and dread than I eve could if I merely tried to describe the action for the players.  They realize full well how important mood is to this game and do everything they can to help the keeper convey that to the players.  They even provide tips on what kind of music would be appropriate to play in the background during certain adventures.  I never saw that in D&D before!  An excellent campaign for players of this game.  Better for experienced players but even new players can get through it with a little help from the Keeper.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonators travel to that island, now risen from the ocean, for the final battle against the Lords of the Silver Twilight.

When I was a kid, my oldest brother, who was seven years older than I, had a huge collection of Archie comics, all from the mid 1960's through the early 1970's. He had them in a big box in his closet and I would go in and read them over and over.  More than any other era Archie comic followed all the trends of the 1960's as they briskly came and went.  From Elvis and hot-rods to The Beatles, miniskirts, Nehru jackets and flower power.  Reading Archie comics in the 1960's is truly a time capsule of that era.  This volume begins with an introduction by one of the icons of the 1960's, Frankie Avalon.  Frankie's introduction is more an ode to the 1960's than it is about Archie comics, but it's still nice to hear from a guy who is so identified with one particular era.  In all this volume has over a dozen stories ranging from 1961 through 1969 and it's so interesting to see how the gang has been transformed from the big-band, bobby-soxer era to the psychedelic 1960's over the course of over twenty years.<br /><br />My favorite stories in this collection include:<br /><br />\\"Too Close for Comfort\\"  Jughead and Archie are making fun of Betty & Veronica's tight fitting Slim-Jim pants until a dunk in a park water fountain finds the boy's pants shrunk to a very uncomfortable level of tightness.<br /><br />\\"Bop that Beatle\\" is a Beatle-era story from 1964 as Beatle mop top wigs are all the rage.  When Veronica sends one to Archie as a gift, he and Jughead think it's a pest and try to kill it.<br /><br />\\"Board Game\\"  Archie tackles the era of beach parties and surfing.  Reggie is showing off his surfer skills to the girls making Archie jealous.  Arch tries a crash course at surfing with disastrous results.<br /><br />\\"Mini-skirt Madness\\"  Yet another 60's icon is covered as the boys go ga-ga over the girl's new mini-skirts.<br /><br />\\"Flower Power\\" from 1968 has Juggy turning into a hippie.  Interesting in that going Hippie was dealt with as almost a monster-like transformation and something to be shown off as Veronica wants to Juggy to the Country Club for all her friends to see.<br /><br />\\"The Time of your Life\\" shows true 60's influence as the gang plans a trip to a park for a picnic, throwing the park guards into a panic over what they think will be a marauding band of rambunctious teens.<br /><br />\\"Ding a Ling\\" from 1969 is yet another fashion-oriented story as Reggie is showing off his new Nehru jacket, beads, and bell he wears around his neck.  Archie counters him by showing up to the big dance with a cow bell!<br /><br />Archie Comics has put out two volumes from both the 40's and 50's and I certainly hope they do so with the 1960's as well.  To me it's the era that really reminds me of the comics.  The ever-changing fashion styles and events always stayed current with the times.  No era saw so many changes as the 1960's did and Archie moved right along and grew up as well.Interesting in that going Hippie was dealt with as almost a monster-like transformation and something to be shown off as Veronica wants to Juggy to the Country Club for all her friends to see. <br /> <br />\\"The Time of your Life\\" shows true 60's influence as the gang plans a trip to a park for a picnic, throwing the park guards into a panic over what they think will be a marauding band of rambunctious teens. <br /> <br />\\"Ding a Ling\\" from 1969 is yet another fashion-oriented story as Reggie is showing off his new Nehru jacket, beads, and bell he wears around his neck.

They are beautiful, almost angelic-like beings of grace.  The Alichino are drawn to a young man named Tsugiri who is a Kusabi.  Alichino are drawn to his powers like moths to a flame but at the same time, Kusabi has the power to kill the Alichino as well.  Tsugiri soon finds himself caught between groups of Alichino who want to hunt him down and those who want to protect him such as Ryoko, Enju, and Myobi.  Why these Alichino want to protect his is never really stated although they appear to have almost a symbiotic relationship to Tsugiri.  Soon though, a rival Alichino named Matsurika arrives and attacks Enju.  She abducts him and carries him away, knowing that Ryoko and Tsugiri will follow and attempt to rescue him.  In this realm they meet the Lord Yui, who has humans devoted to him, unaware that he too, is Alichino.<br /><br />The artwork by Kouyu Shurei is the main selling point of the series.  It is among the most gorgeous art I've ever seen in a Manga and conveys an undercurrent of sadness throughout.  The lush lines and detail is truly phenomenal.  That said, it is, and Shurei even makes light of this, sometimes hard to tell the female characters from the make.  The Alichino have an Elf-like androgynous look to them, again almost angelic.  It does occasionally make the story somewhat difficult to follow.  My biggest complaint would be with the story.  While Shurei is a brilliant artist, his story-telling skills are somewhat lacking.  Not much of anything happens for the first half of the book until Matsurika shows up and attacks Enju.  There's also come confusion to me with Tsugiri.  Should he not view the Alichino as enemies since most want to hunt him down?  What is the nature of his relationship to the group of Alichino who protect him?  A lot of questions are there and few answers are provided.  Perhaps it will all wrap up neatly in the final volume of the trilogy.<br /><br />Reviewed By Tim Janson<br /> <br />Reviewed By Tim Janson	2005-06-20

Kenzer & Co., not content to rest on its laurels, have also provided a thorough and thoroughly enjoyable Atlas for the Kingdoms of Kalamar.  The Campaign book came with two, large fold-out maps.  The Atlas takes those maps, breaking them down into dozens of full page sections, and within each section, further divides them into grids which detail all of the cities, towns, and village within each tiny map section.  Were shown a greater detail of the terrain and topography as well.  About the first two-thirds of the book are dedicated to these full page maps.<br /><br />From there we get into the appendices.  These further define and shape the Kingdoms of Kalamar and the continent of Tellene.  In Appendix A we get new maps which provide information on common trade routes, ocean currents, trade winds and air pressure systems, mineral deposits, industry, grain production, military deployments, and more.<br /><br />Appendix B provides notes on pronunciation throughout the realms, Appendix C details the various land categories such as mountains, swamps, hills, lakes & rivers, etc...  Other appendices delve into the various languages spoken on Tellene and where they are spoken.  The last appendix charts every known city, town, village, or hamlet along with their population.<br /><br />Combined with the Campaign setting book, this makes a wonderfully detailed world for players to adventure in.  The designers have managed to give the GM a diversified and vigorous world, uniquely faceted, and yet ready for the GM to provide his own special touch.  The maps are extremely well made and beautifully colored.  The topography is accurate as well as the various notes on things like weather and currents.  Few designers would think to include these items into their worlds. This is a handsomely illustrated 240 page hardcover book.  A must have if you own the Kingdoms of Kalamar Campaign setting.

Barker was really unlike anyone at the time as we went right for the throat with a raw, visceral, and yes quite graphic style.  Barker's had several of his stories turned into film but the most famous was the Hellraiser films.  Barker actually directed the first film and wrote the screenplay.  In the 90's Marvel Comics Epic line had a Hellraiser comic series and Checker Books has been doing a fantastic job of collecting these fantastic stories into trade paperback format.  This is the third collection and includes fifteen stories from some of the top artists and writers in the world of comics including: Jan Strnad, John Bolton, Berni Wrightson, Scott Hampton, and many more.  This massive trade also includes dozens of full page illustrations, darkly complementing the stories within.<br /><br />Among the stories in this volume that rank as standouts:<br /><br />\\"To Prepare a Face\\" by Jan Strnad and Mark Chiarello is a silent film era story about (although never mentioned by name) silent horror star Lon Chaney Sr., the \\"Man of a Thousand Faces\\".  We'll find that it takes more than just great make-up to turn Chaney into the memorable characters like the Hunchback of Notre Dame and the Phantom of the Opera\\".<br /><br />\\"The Warm Red\\" by Strnad and Berni Wrightson concerns a middle-aged con-woman who looks to bilk a country hick out of his home because she knows that a development country will be soon building a theme park in the area.  The temptress soon finds herself making another deal for her very life...with a Cenobite!<br /><br />Larry Wachowski of Matrix fame provides the story for \\"Closets\\" about an abusive mother who locks up her young son in a basement closet, all alone with nothing...except a lamentation puzzle box.<br /><br />\\"Under the Knife\\" by Ron Wolfe and Bill Reinhold ties in the Jack the Ripper legend with a modern day serial slayer with a reporter caught in the middle between the two bloody fiends.<br /><br />An obvious Donald Trump-like character in \\"I in the Pyramid\\" has become the world's first trillionaire but can only maintain his status as a recruiter for hell with the largest pyramid scheme ever perpetrated.<br /><br />\\"The Tontine\\" by Scott Hampton.  Several friends enter into a tontine, a pact in which the last survivor will gain the jackpot.  The friends meet year after year to play a deadly game of Russian Roulette until the last survivor gets his just rewards.<br /><br />\\"The Sweet Science\\"  The heavyweight boxing champion is bored as he seeks a real challenge.  When he unknowingly unlocks a puzzle cube within the boxing ring, he's faced with a greater challenge than he could ever imagine.<br /><br />As you would expect, this is a book aimed at mature audiences due to the subject matter as well as the grisly illustrations.  These stories represent an expansion of the Hellraiser mythos that is even better than all but the first couple of films.  They provide some great background on the motivations of these demons, particularly Pinhead, who takes a starring role in a few of the tales, including one where he is placed on trial by his rivals in hell.  The art is uniformly great throughout and it's quite interesting to see different artist's interpretations of the Cenobites.

Lovecraft, 6th Edition	Books	5	145	149	N	N	A UNIQUELY DARK ROLE-PLAYING GAME	I remember reading about the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game way back in an old issue of Dragon magazine when they reviewed the first edition.  I remember thinking, \\"Come on...who's going to play a game based on Lovecraft?\\"  Well, nearly 25 years later, this game is still going strong and now on it its 6th edition.  This game truly is unlike any other role-playing game, not only in style but in the players and GM's thought processes.<br /><br />The book opens with a history of the Cthulhu Mythos including the stories and writers who crafted them.  Characters are generated much the same with most role-playing games with die rolls for Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence Constitution, etc, along with probably the game's most important stat, Sanity.  More on Sanity later...Next you choose your characters occupation which in turn starts the character off with certain skill based on that selection.  You then have points to add to these skills as you see fit.  The game doesn't have levels in the traditional sense.  Advancement is in the form of increased skills which can improve a players skill in things such as investigation, weapons, medical, magic use, and many more.<br /><br />Combat is fought in rounds with the player or NPC with the highest dexterity moving first and so on.  But Call of Cthulhu is not a game about combat.  In fact as pointed out early and often, charging in with weapons as the ready often leads to the certain death of the PCs.  This will be the most difficult transition for gamers of D&D.  In this game, you're not superheroes...you're every day Joes confronting things that can rend you limb from limb without breaking a sweat.  And that may be the best thing that will happen to you!  Far worse than death may be the loss of your sanity.  Throughout the game players will encounter information and creatures that are simply too much for our their minds to deal with and they will need to make a sanity check to see if they lose sanity points and how much.  Dropping to low in SAN can result in temporary or even permanent insanity as you are reduced to a gibbering fool ready for a padded room.  The book contains a comprehensive section detailing various types of mental disorders and their affects upon players.  Luckily there are ways of increasing your sanity points such as by defeating these entities or by raising skills above 90%.<br /><br />The use of Mythos magic comes with a price and should be used sparingly.  Using magic, reading and studying forbidden tomes of dark lore can all lower one's sanity points and yet magic is vital as it's often the only way to dispel the other-worldly creatures you will encounter.  The book does a great job of listing these various books including such tomes as The Necronomicon, The Book of Eibon, and The King in Yellow, and how long it takes to study and comprehend them, and the loss of sanity you may suffer.<br /><br />The rules offer characters the chance to play in three different eras of time: The 1890's the 1920's/30's and present day, but it's quite evident that the 20's/30's are the preferred era since this is when Lovecraft and many of his contemporaries like Clark Ashton Smith and Robert E. Howard, wrote their stories.  This may be a bit limited in terms of technology but it really is the best fit to get into the true spirit of the game.  Playing in the era makes characters think more than if they played in the modern era with internet access and computers.  They'll find out while private eyes were referred to as \\"gumshoes\\"!<br /><br />A detailed reference sections gives descriptions and statistics of the various elder Gods and Great Old Ones, such as Cthulhu himself, as well as the less servitor and independent races, including the Serpent People of Howard's Valusia and  the Hounds of Tindalos, created by Frank Belknap Long.  The rules also contain a history of the Necronomicon, Lovecraft's legendary tome of forbidden lore.  And for those perhaps not familiar with Mr. Lovecraft, there is a short but comprehensive bio of Lovecraft.<br /><br />Call of Cthulhu is almost an anti-roleplaying game as it deconstructs many of the conventions of role-playing.  It isn't about hacking and slashing and trucking off the Dragon's gold and personal advancement.  Truly players have to work as a team in this game to not only solve the situations they will face, but to survive.  The game also requires much more work and thought by the GM, referred to as the Keeper.  Again, you're just not drawing a dungeon on a piece of graph paper and populating it with monsters who have no reason for being there, and sending the players on their way.  A good GM can make or break a role-playing adventure, and that goes doubly for this game.  Thankfully the editors have also provided for scenarios within the book to get players going and to give the Keeper some influence on designing their own adventures.<br /><br />In the first scenario called \\"The Haunting\\", the players are called to investigate strange goings-on in the Old Corbitt house.  The next adventure, \\"Edge of Darkness\\" has the players called to the hospital bedside of a dying man who tells them he and some other students conjured up an evil spirit in an old farmhouse forty years ago.  The entity is confined to the house until the last of the men is dead...and this old man is the last and near death's door.  In \\"The Madman\\" the players investigate strange noises and lights in Jenning, Vermont where a reporter has disappeared.  The last scenario, \\"Dead Men Stomp\\" is a 30's jazz era adventure about a cursed trumpet and what exactly the curse brings when the horn is blown.<br /><br />In addition to these adventures, Chaosium offers a wide selection of additional sourcebooks and scenario books.  I suspect many keepers will use these until they get several games sessions under their belt in order to feel confident in developing their own adventures.  Call of Cthulhu isn't for everyone.  It's squarely aimed at a more cerebral and mature gamer who has become bored with the standard dungeon trawling.  If this sounds like you then you can do no better that this chilling and wholly refreshing role-playing game experience.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonith Mr. Lovecraft, there is a short but comprehensive bio of Lovecraft. <br /> <br />Call of Cthulhu is almost an anti-roleplaying game as it deconstructs many of the conventions of role-playing.

This trade paperback takes place in the time that the G.I. Joe team had been disbanded and Snake Eyes was living a quiet life with Scarlett and the two are soon to be wed.  Snake Eyes has taken on an apprentice, who will be the last pupil to be trained in the Arashikage clan.  Ophelia is a young woman and quite capable and after going through her training with T'jbang and Nunchuck, she is ready to undergo her final trial with Snake Eyes.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Sean Collins, the Son of Wade Collins, a former...and reformed...member of Cobra's Crimson Guard has joined an elite special-ops unit called the Hammer Team.  They are given the assignment of capturing the former Cobra Terrorist and mercenary code named Firefly, who is recruiting operatives for a mysterious third party.  The Hammer Team sets the trap for Firefly and are joined by Snake Eyes and Ophelia.  But the operation is botched badly and Firelfy kills Ophelia and escapes.<br /><br />Both Collins and Snake Eyes are guilt-ridden, blaming themselves for the tragedy.  Snake Eyes calls off his wedding to Scarlett and escapes to his retreat in the wilderness.  Collins soon shows up and offers to become Snake Eyes' newest apprentice.  Collins takes on the name of Kamakura and learns the way of the Arashikage Ninja.  Eventually Firefly is tracked to Tokyo as Snake Eyes, Kamakura, and Other Joe members again go after the Merc only this time another surprise awaits Snake Eyes...a foe from his past!<br /><br />One of the great things that Devil's Due has done since taking over the G.I. Joe comic license is to personalize the various characters and give them some depth that they never had under Marvel's guidance.  Previously they were one-dimensional characters distinguished mainly by their code names but writer Brandon Jerwa has fleshed out these characters, and made them real by giving them a human side.  The silent Snake Eyes can speak volumes with his eyes and expressions and there is true heartbreak when he cancels his wedding to Scarlett.  The Sean Collins character is an interesting one as he is seeking double redemption for the death of Ophelia as well as for his father's past with Cobra.  He literally gives himself to Snake Eyes in a move of ultimate honor.<br /><br />\\"Master and Apprentice\\" is well paced and balances action and drama as well as any Joe tale I've ever read.  The art by Sunder Raj and Stefano Castelli is darker and grittier than many other Joe tales and complements the story perfectly.  The book also features bio pages on the major players in this story which serve to give it even more depth.  This is one of Devil's Due's best G.I. Joe stories yet.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonhe cancels his wedding to Scarlett.

When it came to a world, you were pretty much on your own.  Then TSR came out with the World of Greyhawk in the early 80'swhich at the time was quite wonderful.  You got a couple of nice maps and two soft cover books detailing the lands and peoples of Greyhawk. Times have really changed!  Kenzer and Co. have produced one of the most detailed and rich campaign settings ever for Dungeons & Dragons in this massive 272 page hardcover book.<br /><br />\\"Kingdoms of Kalamar\\" introduces us to the lands and peoples of the continent of Tellene.  The first two-thirds of the book detail everything you could possibly want to know about the area with a different chapter for each kingdom.  These sections detail the climate, population, government & politics, military, temples, economy, underworld, and interesting sites of all of the cities and towns within each kingdom.  Each of the various human peoples is described meticulously including their histories and migrations, physical make-ups, styles of names, even their alphabets.<br /><br />The attention to detail is staggering as each city is give a one to two page synopsis that in addition to the info mentioned previously, also includes the city's history, notes on demi-human and humanoid populations, notable NPCs, and also provides anecdotes that can be used to develop adventures in these various regions.  For example, we learn that in the city of Ospolen the daughter of Duke Letton has been kidnapped and the Duke is offering a reward of 10,000 gold pieces for her safe return.<br /><br />\\"Kingdoms of Kalama\\"r is filled with political intrigue providing a framework for more than just the typical hack & slash gaming experience.  We learn that the Empire of Kalamar was once much larger but the current ruling family has managed to lose nearly half its territories.  The Duchy of O' Par declared itself independent just eighty years ago without reprisal and the Principality of Pekal rebelled against the empire over one hundred years ago and now the Empire is dead set on regaining the territory.  These various notes and interesting sites will provide the DM with many solid foundations for adventures for player characters.<br /><br />The selling point of any campaign setting is if it's just words on a page or if the world is truly living and breathing.  Kingdoms of Kalamar is incredibly vibrant.  While maybe some gamers find the various political intrigues of these lands unneeded in a role-playing game, I found that they added tremendous depth.  So often, campaign settings tend to be very one-dimensional with flat histories and characters. Not so in \\"Kingdoms of Kalamar.\\"  In the east on the Kaotoon Island in Reanaaria Bay you will find Aasaer, the City of Pirates.  Described as having \\"seedy taverns that litter every corner, murder victims rotting in the alleys, and prostitutes crowding the doorways\\", it's a location that sounds like a fun place to visit!<br /><br />The final one-third of the book features sections on the various organizations and groups of Kalamar, major languages, law in the kingdoms, and appendices on constellations, armies, and NPCs.  The book also gives a description of each of the nearly four dozen Gods of the world with their names in the assorted languages, symbols, typical appearance, raiment colors, etc.  A short history of the gods is provided as we learn that the Creator made fifty-four gods, each representing a different aspect of Her personality.  The Gods eventually war amongst themselves and nearly a dozen are destroyed.  Now they use the peoples of Tellene as their pawns, drawing power as their number of worshippers increase.<br /><br />The book also has two large, fold-out maps with the entire continent of Tellene, beautifully done.  A nice touch is that the developers did not mar the map with a grid.  Instead they provided the nice touch of including a tear-out, clear plastic overlay with a hexagonal grid to place over the map.<br /><br />Different people look for different things within a campaign setting.  I don't like to have everything spelled out for me, taking the creative thought out of the game.  \\"Kingdoms of Kalamar\\" provides a detailed framework from which the DM can create all manner of adventures from.  This is an extremely well constructed world, ready to be trampled underfoot by your player characters!<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonng a tear-out, clear plastic overlay with a hexagonal grid to place over the map.<br /><br />Different people look for different things within a campaign setting.

Grover is out playing and suddenly realizes he has to go to the potty.  He gets up and begins running home.  The other characters see him and invite him to play but he keeps telling them \\"I have to go\\" leaving them wondering where it is he is going to.  Finally he gets home and tells his mother he has to go and she helps him off with his suspenders so he can go to the potty.  The main complaint seems to be that Grover never says he is going to the potty until right at the very end.  I don't see a major problem with that.  I don't view the book as something to help me potty train as much as a book that makes going to the potty fun and I think it succeeds in doing just that.	2005-06-10

Not just evil...but vile evil, pure evil.  And were not talking player characters running amok, were talking a book that probably is not even suitable for kids or inexperienced gamers.  It's definitely geared towards the mature as it pulls no punches in dealing with the essence of evil.  It even states it's intended for mature audiences in the introduction so don't discount the warning as mere rhetoric.  This is Hellraiser type evil...mean, nasty, and vicious and boy is it fun to read.  Even if you don't incorporate this into your settings or campaigns it's worth reading anyway.<br /><br />The book stars out by defining the nature of evil, at least in terms of a D&D environment before delving into such topics as vile gods and races, creating villains, torture, sacrifices, curses, etc.  The book also introduces us to the \\"Vile feats\\" for your evil character, although as the book says they are intended for NPCs but with a little modification and approval of your DM, well, you know...<br /><br />The book introduces several prestige classes including such things as Demonologist, Lifedrinker, Soul Eater, Vermin Lord, as well as disciples or Thralls of various Arch Devils or Demon Lords.  The book also features a number of new spells, magic items, artifacts, and monsters.  But the thing many long time gamers like myself have looked forward to is the revamping of the Arch Dukes of Hell and Demonlords from the very first old Monster Manual.  Asmodeus, Bel, Dispater, Orcus, Demogorgon...they are all here and done the way they always should have been where even ultra-high level PCs will think twice about trying to take these guys on.<br /><br />Can you use PC's with this book?  Clearly it's designed for DM's only and as such presents quite a new challenged for players.  I personally prefer it as a DM source only as I'm old fashioned and I prefer players to be good and battle evil and this book provides a wealth of evil.  Like most WOC products the art is uniformly good although not spectacular.  A welcome addition for the DMwealth of evil.  Like most WOC products the art is uniformly good although not spectacular.

Holmes' brother Mycroft sends an urgent telegram to his brother requesting his brother's aid in investigating some mysterious murders and threats against the Queen herself.  The setting moves to a gloomy castle for the bulk of the book as there are those that believe a vengeful spirit is to blame for the brutal murders.  Holmes and Watson begin their investigation and questioning of a group of possible suspects includinig, of course, the Butler.<br /><br />Carr does a very good job of capturing the essence of Victorian England with speech, mannerisms and settings.  Holmes and Watson seem very \\"Doyle-esque\\".  Carr also does a pretty decent imitation of Doyle in terms of tone but doesn't have Doyle's ability to really craft a complex mystery that is solveable by Holmes' legendary deductive skills.  He kind of just figures things out without really relating how he did it and before you know it, the novel is over.  This is one time where I wish about fifty pages had been added to the story.  It just moves a bit too fast.<br /><br />All in all, a decent Pastiche but not as good some others...	2005-06-08

Many areas of the United States can boast a rich heritage of ghost stories:  Gettysburg, the old west, the deep south, etc, all have their great traditions, but none has ever so captured my interest as the ghosts of New England, and specifically Boston.  As author Holly Mascott Nadler points out, Boston's long history of the weird dates from the Salem with trial episode to modern day where much of the architecture of colonial times still stands today.  Nadler takes readers on a whirlwind tour of some of Boston's most well-known hauntings and some not so well known.  From haunted houses to haunted inns and everything in between, it is a compelling look at a city brimming with chills.<br /><br />Among the over two dozen tales in this book you'll read about:<br /><br />\\"The Tainted Honeymoon\\" where a bachelor named Jim moves into an apartment on Beacon Hill and soon discovers it's haunted by an occasionally helpful female spirit.  But things soon turn ugly when Jim meets a woman and they marry.  Her pleasant demeanor soon turns rude and downright happy on their honeymoon and the marriage is quickly annulled.  Was the spirit so in love with Jim that it ruined his marriage?<br /><br />In \\"The House of Nightmares\\" we learn about two mid-20's friends who move into an old home and soon experience all manner of spectral occurrences, often violent, including an apparition of a thing they are convinced is not human.  A psychic tells them that a boy went insane within the house and his suffering trapped a demon within the house feeding on the energy.  Needless to say the two men soon moved out.<br /><br />We find that Edgar Allan Poe's short story \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" was based upon a true incident.  When Poe was just 18 he joined the army and was stationed at Ft. Independence on Castle Isle.  Poe begins inquiring about a monument erected in memory of a Lt. Massie.  He learns that Massie had been killed years earlier in a sword duel with another officer, a bully named Captain Green who goaded the inexperienced Massie into the duel.  Grief-stricken, Massie's comrades got Green inebriated one night, led him into the dank lower dungeons, shackled him, and walled him up alive.  A shackled skeleton would be found behind a wall by a work crew nearly a hundred years later in 1905.<br /><br />Another literary giant, Nathaniel Hawthorne, had his own spectral experience.  Hawthorne often frequented a private library to read and research.  The library was also frequented by a minister named Dr. Thaddeus Harris and while the pair were not friends, they would exchange courteous nods.  Hawthorne is saddened one evening to learn of Harris's death but he's then shocked to see the old minister, sitting in his same old spot in the library the following day, even giving Hawthorne a nod of acknowledgement.<br /><br />Among Boston's most somber locations is the Central Burying Ground in Boston Common.  First established in 1634, the sight would be the final resting place of all manner of people of ill repute including thieves, murderers, pirates, accused witches, and even Catholics, who were often buried without even a marker for their graves.<br /><br />Speaking of witches, no examination of Boston's ghosts would be complete without mention of the Salem Witch Trials of 1692.  It's a subject that I've read numerous books on and many hauntings are associated with it.  Perhaps the most well-known is the curse laid on Salem by Giles Corey, an accused witch who refused to testify.  Rather then being hung as the other accused witches, Corey was pressed to death under the weight of heavy rocks until dead.  In his dying breath he cursed the Sheriff and Salem.  Since then, every Sheriff of Essex Country has either died from a heart attack or stroke, or had to resign due to heart related ailments.<br /><br />Nadler's enthusiasm for the subject matter is very evident from the introduction.  Besides writing, she also has a regular ghost-walk that she leads touristson.  This book is certainly just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Boston's ghost stories and I would certainly love to see a second volume someday.  I will agree with the other reviewer that definite locations and directions to the various haunting sites would have been a real plus, especially for visiting ghost-hunters.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansone leads tourists on.

In this year we get to see the peanuts characters develop into the ones we've come to love over the past decades.  Yes the art is somewhat less polished but the characters have now evolved from the near toddlers into kids.  Linus in particular is now talking and developing his distintive personality, with his blanket in tow.  Snoopy has evolved too as we begin to see that wild imagination start to come out of him.  Lucy is still a terror but now she's becoming infatuated with Schroeder.  Other characters such as Shermy would begin to be somewhat phased out with fewer appearances.<br /><br />Fantagraphics has done a marvelous job with these comprehensive and high-quality volumes.  I used to eat the old paperbacks by Fawcett up when I was a kid and these chronological volumes are a dream come true.  Matt Groening, creater of the Simpsons provides the introduction to this volume.  Now if only we could get new volumes 3 or 4 times a year, things would be perfect.	2005-06-08

As good as the film was it was still \\"Hollywood\\" and Jonathan Eig's book really brings the whole story home about this giant of a sports legend.  Gehrig was pretty much the polar opposite of the more flamboyant Babe Ruth.  A quite, unassuming son of German Immigrants whose shyness presented what was perceived as a somewhat dull personality.<br /><br />It's a classic story of the poor kid growing up in a rough area as his mother strove to provide a better life for her son and the father who comes off as less supportive than his movie counterpart.  You see Gehrigs rise to the big leagues and that fateful day when he took over for Wally Pipp to begin his streak of 2130 straight games, a streak which lasted over 50 years.  His relationship with Ruth was indeed interesting and one gets the feeling that each were a bit amused by the other.<br /><br />The book moves along well but as we move into Gehrig's latter career, and the onset of ALS in 1938, it does become painful to read.  That's something that wasn't nearly covered as strongly or tragically in the film.  Now so many years later we have a greater understanding of what ALS is it makes Gehrig's strength and determination to play on that much more heroic.  Eig's thorough research provides the most comprensive look at the life and career of one of baseball's all-time greats.  A true legend and role-model.  We could use a Lou Gehrig today!	2005-06-07

And, in truth, Halloween has boomed in the past twenty years to become second only to Christmas in decorating and celebrating the season.  As Diane C. Arkins shows in this wonderful book, however, Halloween has been widely celebrated for well over one hundred years and this book concentrates on what Arkins calls Halloween's golden age from the 1870's to the 1930's.  The book is filled with hundreds of vintage photographs, illustrations, and magazine reprints from the period.<br /><br />Halloween was not the ghoulish, gory holiday that it is today, but rather a day of revelry when people would hold parties for adults as well as children.  Throughout the book writers of the times dispense advice, squarely aimed at women, on how to throw a successful Halloween party.  We begin with invitations with some classic examples of period artwork depicting pumpkins, witches or black cats.  Showing far more thought, as well as sophistication, magazines even gave advice on what to write, often favoring catchy little rhymes.<br /><br />Halloween decorations became widely available during the 1910's and Halloween Merrymaking presents hundreds of photographs depicting these vintage decorations.  Illustrations and photos show various themes of the times.  Interestingly, many of these decorations are being recaptured these days by modern crafters.  The fantastic crepe` paper and paper Mache decorations are a collectors dream!<br /><br />Party favors presented to children or adults were staples of Halloween get-togethers in the golden age.  A popular idea of the 20's and 30's was \\"Jack Horner Pies\\" in which a centerpiece stood in the middle of the table with ribbons pulled to the end of the table, separating it into wedges, one for each guest.  Within each wedge the hostess places  small gifts or party favors such as fortunes, written in milk on paper so they would be invisible until held under a light, The fortune would hen be placed inside a walnut shell.<br /><br />The magazines of the era also offered advice on what to serve for your party and included such forgotten delicacies as Little Goblin Stuffed Eggs and Moon Sandwiches.  The book even provides sample menus for different types of parties such as formal, informal, or children's.  Next up is the entertainment with suggestions on music and dances and games, as well as advice on costumes.  During the 20's and 30's occultism was extremely popular and the book offers numerous fortune-telling and divination games that people could play at their parties.<br /><br />Finally Arkins reprints several full, vintage articles on Halloween from magazines such as Woman's Home Companion, Woman's World, and Ladies Home Journal.  You really get a sense after reading the book just how much Halloween was enjoyed back then without the rampant commercialism of today.  This is a nostalgic walk back in time to an era of simplicity and fun.  It's fun and educational to see how our grandparents and great-grandparents may have celebrated Halloween decades ago.

She really knows how to breathe life into characters that are so often flat in books like this.  Set in and around the legendary row house slums of Philly, Scottoline's hero is Assistant U.S. Attorney Vicky Allegretti.  Vicky is new to to the U.S. attorney's office and finds herself inheriting a case left behind by the previous Assistant DA.  She's investigating an illegal gun sale operation and along with her partner, an ATF agent named Morty, they visit an apartment complex to speak to an informant.  Their visit interrupts a robbery, or so it seems and both Morty and the informant are shot dead.<br /><br />Vicky is determined to find the killer but she's stonewalled by her her boss as well as wrangling by various departments over who will handle the case.  She comes in contact with a woman who may have been involved in the shootings.  Certainly she was invloved in the sale of the illegal guns.  Vicky attacks the woman after she won't cooperate and gets suspended from her job.  Yet shortly later this woman, Reheema decides to help Vicky after he mother is killed.  The two make for a typical odd-couple pairing but Scottoline handles the characters with such skill that it comes across very fresh and with a good deal of humor to boot.  The pair take their investigation to the grimy and dangerous city streets to uncover a plot filled with unexpected twits and sub-plots involving the local drug traffickers in the area where Reheema's mother was killed.<br /><br />Devils' Corner takes full advantage of Scottolines legal expertise and knowledge of Philadelphia to write a story with plots and characters that are so true to life.  Great book!	2005-06-03

Gas Grills may be looked down upon by VERY serious barbecuers but the fact is a gas grill is probably what most people cook on today due to its ease of use and cleanup.  No waiting for coals or wood to get hot, no ashes to dump...<br /><br />This Weber book isn't an all encompassing book like some of the other Weber books.  At just over 200 pages it's rather slight actually.  It gives just over a 100 recipes, more or less a sampling of what you can do on your gas grill rather than a bible type tome.  Tips are provided with colorful illustrations demonstrating direct and indirect cooking methods, as well as options for smoking and adding a rotisserie.  From there you get into the meat of the book (pun intended) and some very nice recipes.  Honestly a lot the recipes don't seem like \\"guy\\" type dishes.  I mean I can't see the average backyard cook making Prosciutto wrapped Shrimp for example.  It may be quite good but it's not my cup of tea.  I'd prefer some more stick to your rips type of recipes.  I did find a few so far that I did like...The Mediterranean Flank Steak is good.  I prefer it on a crusty italian roll rather than a pita, though.  The filet mignon with shoestring potatoes was great.  Filet Mignons are some of my favorite things to make on my grill.<br /><br />All in all, this book provides some interested deviations from typical grill fare so if that's what your're looking for this is a great book for you.	2005-06-03

From the pre-Revolutionary colonial period through the Civil War's bloodiest battle at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania can boast over 250 years of spectral tales guaranteed to chill the spines of the most avid ghost hunters.  Dan Asfar's book is laid out in various chapters with accounts of haunted houses, theaters, taverns, battlefields, even mundane items such as paintings which make Pennsylvania a prime spot for ghost hunters to visit.<br /><br />In New Hope you will find the Aaron Burr house.  Oddly named because the house was built after Burr died.  But after killing Alexander Hamilton in their fateful duel, Burr fled to New Hope where he had friends and hid in a cellar where the current house now stands.  Visitors often feel the piercing glare as if someone is staring at them intently.  And Burr's spirit is known to tug on the clothes of visitors as they try to leave and they are advised to kindly say to the spirit, \\"Mr. Burr, please let me leave.\\"<br /><br />Gettysburg has long been considered the most haunted spot in the United States, and the site where over 50,000 men lost their lives during that climactic battle of the Civil War.  Asfar first gives a short but concise history of the battle before delving into some of the strange occurrences and sightings that have been reported in the area for well over a hundred years.  Ghostly lights and sounds are often heard as the spirits of the dead soldiers replay the battle over and over.  Cameras have often been reported to malfunction around Gettysburg but work perfectly fine once you've left the area.  Gettysburg should be the very first stop for any ghost hunter visiting Pennsylvania.<br /><br />The Tate House has stood for well over 200 years and was formerly home to Anthony Tate who died in 1781 and left the house to his son James who was a surgeon.  James had a fanatical interest in anatomy and experimented as much as he could on various animals but he really wanted a human body to research.  He got his chance when he dug up the body of a recently deceased Hessian mercenary, took it back to his cellar and dissected it.  Tate buried what was left in the dirt of the cellar but shortly after strange things began to happen.  When he would walk over the spot where the remains were buried his candle would blow out although there was no draft.  At night he would seem to hear footsteps coming up the stairs from the cellar.  Even today, the building is used as a teachers quarters for a boarding school, residents report hearing the strange sounds from the cellar.<br /><br />Haunted painting?  You can find that in Pennsylvania, too.  Nellie Tallman was three years old when she fell off a stool and broke her neck while posing for the portrait.  Her father adored the portrait of his late daughter but every time he hung it up, he would invariably find it lying face down on the floor a short time later.  The portrait would be given to a museum many decades later who experienced the same problems keeping Nellie on the wall.<br /><br />From the ghostly hounds of Lebanon County, to the Eastern State Penitentiary to the famous Mishler Theater, Pennsylvania's rich and chilling hauntings are a banquet for any fans of ghost stories.  Asfar provides a lively narrative and knows just the right buttons to push to get your hair standing straight up.

From comic books to Buffy novels to the Outcast series, one wonders where he finds time to do it all.  Actually this one is co-written by Ford Lytle Gilmore.  This is the start of a new series by Golden set in Sleepy Hollow.  Three more books in the series are already planned.  In this one, two teens move with their family to the little town of Sleepy Hollow, New York.  Everything seems pleasant enough in the beginning but then soon the kids find out that the old legends of the mysterious Headless Horseman may be more than just a story to scare kids. As they attempt to solve the mystery they find themselves being pursued by the Horseman and hell itself.<br /><br />Enjoyable story.  Golden knows how to write for juveniles and teenagers as well as any writer with intelligent stories that never seem to campy or condescending.  I would say the hollow is best aimed at middle-schoolers, maybe 11 - 14 age range with enough chills for reading on a couple of dark and stormy nights.  Good start to a new series and looking forward to the second book.	2005-06-02

There were a lot of very talented cartoonists doing outstanding books which never saw the light of day outside of the small press community.  But thanks to companies like Ad-House books, great titles like Joel Priddy's Pulpatoon Pilgrimage are available to a mass audience.  You won't find scantily clad women in tights or lasers shooting out of someone's eyes, but you will find a talented cartoonist producing a thoughtful and bittersweet strip that really captures the essence of small press.<br /><br />Pulpatoon Pilgrimage tells the tales of three traveling friends: a robot sailer named RowBot, a Minotaur named Bull, and the walking plant-man, Delaware Thistle.  These three friends are on a pilgrimage through the wilderness, each in search of a specific goal.  Along the way they discuss life and relationships, as well as relating their various pasts and how they met.  The graphic novel is told out over a series of smaller chapters as Priddy relates more and more about this eclectic collection of characters, but like any good quest he keeps the readers in suspense, wondering what's over the next hill or beyond that river.  The most interesting and tragic chapter dealt with Delaware's mother, who fell asleep outside against the warnings of her parents and found herself cross-pollinated by a bee in a subtle barb at racism and even mixed marriages.  Priddy has a cartoon style that compares favorably to Jeff Smith's with a very clean, crisp style while maintaining an attention to detail in the character's expressions and reactions.<br /><br />A truly wonderful and insightful little graphic novel by a very talented cartoonist.	2005-06-02

I will submit that eventually the rebels would have won without French military aid, although the war would have lasted much longer...but that it was the French money that was perhaps the biggest aid to the colonists as England was bankrupt and the cost of the war was astronomical.<br /><br />Franklin is shown here not only to be the well-spoken statesman, but a sly, covert operative as he begins his mission to procure the French aid.  This is a lively narrative that brilliantly captures the feel of 18th century France with intrigue that matches any of todays top-selling thrillers made all the more fascinating because they were real life events and people.  Rife with humor, anecdotes, and period writings, and meticulously researched, Schiff gives us yet one more reason to admire Franklin's genius.	2005-06-01

Ok, I'm no prude and I can let the expletives fly as well as any trucker, but Mark Millar seems to have been like a kid in a candy store with his overuse of the \\"F\\" word in the \\"Wanted\\" trade paperback collection.  I don't know, maybe after working on so many of those Marvel titles for so long he had to let a little bit of steam off, but after reading that word for about the 75th time, it sort of loses its effectiveness.  Here's another thing...the words genius and greatness and other superlatives get tossed around a little too easily in the comic book business.  For example in the forward, Brian K. Vaughn refers to JG Jones as one of the three best artists working in comics today.  J.G. Jones is a fine artist but saying he's one of the top three is a wide stretch.  As long as guys like George Perez, Frank Miller, Alex Ross, Marc Silvestri, Jim Lee, John Romia Jr., and quite a few others are drawing breath, Jones has a way to go...<br /><br />Well, onto the Wanted Trade paperback that collects the mini-series.  Wesley Gibson is a total loser.  He's in a dead-end job where his boss harasses him.  He is a young twenties white kid who Jones and Millar obviously modeled on rapper Eminem with the close cropped blonde hair, earrings, and language.  His boss is an overweight black woman and the racial undertones of this relationship are a bit disturbing to say the least.  Wesley's goth girlfriend sleeps around, including with his best friend, and his father left him when he was just a baby.  Now that Millar has gone to these lengths to make us feel sympathy for the Wesley (which doesn't work by the way) we have Wes abducted by a black female supervillain named Fox, patterned after Catwoman.  Wes is taken to a secret, underground hideout filled with supervillains and meets Professor Seltzer.  Wes learns that the villains control the entire world.  Years earlier they pooled their abilities to wipe out all the superheroes and virtually erase all knowledge of their existence from the world.  This is all very cute but just HOW this was accomplished is glossed over.  Now five major villains control their own continent and the run their operation like a global Mafioso.  They use their influence to keep all knowledge of their crimes unreported.  Wes finds out his father was once one of the greatest supervillains called the \\"Killer\\", the world's deadliest assassin and Wes will inherit a huge fortune if he takes over his father's mantle.<br /><br />Wes relishes his new found attitude and powers.  He uses them to get revenge on anyone who wronged him including girls who turned him down for dates and boys who beat him up as a kid.  Now I got turned down for dates in my life but never once did I consider shooting the girls.  Well soon Wes is enjoying an orgy of violence as he walks into a police station and murders every cop there except one...again an overweight black woman.  Fox later asks if he raped her and Wes says he thought about it but didn't because he suddenly felt a wave of guilt.  How nice...he thinks twice about rape after the guilt of murdering dozens of cops...Well soon the various controlling families degenerate into warfare as one faction wants to go public and have people fear them and the other wants to remain secret.  I suppose we were supposed to be rooting for Wes as he opposes the evil Mr. Rictus but by then you've been so desensitized to the violence that the outcome really didn't matter to me.<br /><br />Getting back to the language...Millar was so infatuated with the use of the \\"F\\" word that one chapter is called \\"F**K You\\" and one of the main characters, a Down Syndrome super human is named \\"F**kwit\\".  Still another chapter is called \\"Sh*t List\\" and there's a villain who is a walking pile of excrement cleverly named \\"Sh*thead\\"  Yawn...Throughout the book the characters are clearly patterned on various Marvel and DC heroes and villains and I guess were supposed to chortle about how witty Millar is.  Sadly, underneath thenasty racial stereotypes, mean-spirited violence, and excessive profanity there really was a good story hiding that didn't need the level of degradation that Millar instilled throughout.es, mean-spirited violence, and excessive profanity there really was a good story hiding that didn't need the level of degradation that Millar instilled throughout.	2005-05-31

Unfortunately she has no real powers and her costume consisting of a mini-skirt and bunny ears more often makes her a target for barbs from legit heroes.  After being turned down (again) for membership in the superteam \\"The Protectors\\", Bunny is about to call it quits when she gets a call from a friend on the police force to help investigate a house plagued by demons.  The demons are eventually excised from the home except for one who helped Bunny out...a skull faced, tentacled demon that can swallow about anything called, Mr. Hell.  The attraction is mutual and thus the Dysfunctional Duo is born.<br /><br />This digest-sized trade paperback collects ten different Lovebunny and Mr. Hell stories, written and illustrated by various talents, as the pair battle demons, dinosaurs, supervillains, an angry granny, as well as adventuring into Amish country.  Along the way Bunny meets up with the Savage Dragon and helps him defeat the villainess \\"Industrielle\\" while Mr. Hell is off entertaining the neighborhood kids at a fast food joint.  Throughout, Bunny tries to teach Mr. Hell the finer points of living on Earth, such as Hygiene, proper diet, miniature golf and not eating people.  The adventures are tongue-in-cheek takes on superheroes, especially females as Bunny gets shower scenes, her bath-towel pulled off and panty shots.  Nothing too risqu&eacute;, PG-13.<br /><br />Lovebunny and Mr. Hell is a short, quick little diversion from the everyday stuff.  Tim Seely provides the story and art on most of the stories with able assists from Josh Blaylock, Brendan Hay, and others.  The book even provides a handy guide to the various characters as well as several very nice pinup pages.  Nice, clean, black & white art.  A Fun read!	2005-05-31

Many of use keep the same routines for years, even decades on this day.  My own Thanksgiving tradition has changed very slightly in my life.  A couple of places, a few names, but Thanksgiving still has the same feel that it did to me thirty years ago when I was a kid.  My Thanksgiving, along with millions of other Michiganders, begins with the Detroit Thanksgiving Day Parade.  The name has changed a bit over the 80 years the parade has taken place, but whether you watch on TV or are one of the million spectators who goes to see it live, the parade is still one of our great traditions.<br /><br />Started in 1924 by the J.L. Hudson's Dept. store, the Detroit Thanksgiving parade has grown to become the third largest parade in the nation behind the Rose parade in Pasadena, and the Macy's parade in New York.  In this great book from Arcadia press, we get a look back at the rich history of the parade from its earliest days right up until the 21st century.  Accompanied with over 200 archival photographs we get a glimpse at what the parade was like throughout the decades and how parade organizers have changed to reflect the times.<br /><br />Marching bands have always been a key player in the parade and bands from all over the nation are honored when they are asked to participate.  The photographs do a great job of highlighting not only local high schools, but bands from high schools as far away as Oregon and Texas.  A staple for many years in the parade was the \\"Blue Pigs\\" a rock/jazz band made up of Detroit police officers.<br /><br />Floats were a part of the very first parade in 1924 which featured a horse drawn Mother Goose float.  Over the years floats and themes have changed to reflect the pop culture of the era.  In the 1950's there were floats such as Cinderella's Carriage as well as Davy Crockett.  The 1960's brought us a Flintstones float and then there was the Pillsbury Dough Boy in the 1970's.  The 1990's brought us Elmo from Sesame Street and 2002 saw the debut of the Captain Underpants balloon, based on the popular children's book series.  The 1950's and 60's also saw religious themed floats such as the nativity but with corporate sponsorship taking over the parade the parade officials decided to be politically correct and do away with them.<br /><br />One of the most famous incidents in the parade's history took place in 1990 when Chilly Willy, a giant penguin balloon, tore loose from its moorings and floated away before the parade began.  He was found 25 miles away in Lake St. Clair.  One can only imagine the looks on resident's faces as they saw a giant penguin floating over their neighborhood on that Thanksgiving.<br /><br />In addition to the great photos of the parade, we get behinds the scenes glimpses at parade preparation as workers make the floats from concept drawings all the way through applying the paint.  This was very interesting as it's something you seldom get to see.<br /><br />Santa Claus has played an important role in the parade ever since the first when he made his arrival in a horse drawn carriage on loan from the Detroit Creamery Corp.  Through the years we see the changing designs in Santa's sleigh and his reindeer.  After enjoying the parade for so many years it's great now to be able to share the parade with my own children.

I've always been interested in the Revolutionary War and it is my favorite period of history to read about.  I've read a number of books on the subject with my favorite being \\"Patriots\\" and \\"George Washington's War\\".  I will now be adding \\"1766\\" to my list of favorite Revolutionary War books.  McCullough takes the unique approach of focusing on this one year as opposed to the entire history of the war so it's good for readers to have at least a tertiary understanding of the events leading up to the war and after.  EVen if you don't, though, 1776 makes riveting reading.  McCullough's book is well researched and one of the very best books as far as showing the British side of things.  We would learn for example that British troops were aghast as the revolt against the crown.  Seemingly these colonists had a much higher quality of life than many of the English to begin with...<br /><br />McCullough relates the events of this year told in a stirring, and refreshingly lively narrative as opposed to so many other dry history books.  That's the reason I enjoyed \\"Patriots\\" so well.  At the center of the narrative is George Washington ans while some many wonder why we need another book on our first President, I will contend that Washington is the single greatest figure in our nation's history and we can never learn enough or read enough about him.  McCullough's exciting narrative of the early battles (and defeats) show just how on the brink of implosion the revolution was in its early days.  We see the disaster of the Battle of Brooklyn as British and Hessian troops caught American defenders literally asleep and outflanked as Washington would execute a hasty retreat that would have a devastating effect on the morale of everyone.  This would be the first of a number of defeats for the for Washington's army, all leading up to December 1776, and the famous \\"crossing of the Delaware\\" to raid a Hessian outpost.<br /><br />McCullough presents first hand accounts culled from letters and other writings of the day to present a view of the war through the eyes of both sides and from the lowliest farmer to high-ranking officers.  Narratives are great but there's nothing like reading a person's own words that our over 200 years old.

The New England's tradition of hauntings dates back to the earliest settlers of America and in his book \\"Maine Ghosts & Legends\\", author Thomas Verde concentrates specifically on Maine's ghostly traditions with 26 chilling tales.  The book is sectioned into four parts: Ghost Legends, Haunted Houses, Haunted Places & Objects, and Haunted Inns and Taverns.<br /><br />In Ghost Legends, we'll find out that Maine has their own version of the Flying Dutchman.  During the War of 1812, a ship called \\"Dash\\" was commissioned to detain & seize vessels and goods under powers of war.  Its larger mast gave it more sail and thus extremely fast.  The Dash performed its duties very well but in 1815 it disappeared in a storm.  Months later Maine fisherman began seeing the phantom ship, always when it was foggy out, sail swiftly by, even when there was little or no wind.  These sightings continued right through WWII when both naval and coast guard ships quickly armed themselves after a blip appeared on their radar screens, but then the bewildered sailors caught sight of the phantom ship...<br /><br />Maine's Jewell Island is filled with legends of pirates, buried treasure and ghosts.  The ghost of a man, allegedly murdered by his partner while they sought the buried treasure of Captain Kidd, is said to haunt the island.  Witnesses are said to have seen strange lights and heard shrieks and screams.  In the 1960's several unmarked gravestones were found on the island.  Some believe that these were victims of female pirate Ann Bonney who were killed to keep the location of her treasure a secret.<br /><br />In Norway, Maine,  a young couple with a baby moved into a 200 year old home and began experiencing strange phenomena in the baby's room, such as the baby somehow getting out of his crib and sitting on the floor, windows closing, etc.  A psychic revealed that a three year old boy had died in that room and was now protecting the baby by closing the window what it was cold or rainy and helping the baby from the crib so he didn't fall.<br /><br />A Victorian home in Cape Elizabeth is said to be haunted by the resident's great-grandfather who built the home.  One resident, Ellen, was terrified when she encountered the wraith as it seemed to scream at her but no sound was made.  Other residents reported sensations of being choked while they slept.<br /><br />Besides the tales you'll read about Ghostly nuns and priests that linger at a home in Portland; the theater in Skohegan, haunted by a rather violent spirit; and a haunted tavern in Freeport where the ghost of an Indian haunts the spot where he was murdered by a man seeking revenge for his family's massacre at the hands of Indians many years earlier.<br /><br />Maine certainly can boast a tradition of hauntings as strong as any New England state and Thomas Verde relates these tales in very conversational way, not dry like so many similar books.  My only wish is that they had put in exact locations to some of the spots, at least the commercial spots where ghost-hunters could visit if they take a trip to Maine.

It's geared for 15th level or so characters.  The very thin plot centers on some forgemasters who have died and they are unable to be risen from the dead.  Now why the characters would be concerned about smiths, and why they'd be deserving of being brought back to life is beyond me.  But hey...if that's what it takes to get adventuring then so be it.  The book uses four different chracters as samples that can be played if you don't have characters of 15th level.  Never in over 25 years of playing has anyone ever used the stock characters...what's the point?  They are good to use for the DM to see how the actual PC's compare and then tailor the difficulty of the adveture accordingly.<br /><br />This is a plane-hopping adventure so be prepared to visit the first level of Archeron where the party will travel to the Iron Fortress.  If you're not all into plane-hopping, I supposed you could just as easily set this somewhere on your own world whether it's the Forgotten Realms or one of your own creation.  At the fortress it becomes a decent, but relatively standard dungeon-crawl from there.  There's a couple of new monsters and magic items as well as one new spell.  The art is very good as our the maps.  Not the most original adventure in the world but a fairly decent way to waste a couple of nights playing.	2005-05-25

This short, 160 page book tells of what happens to obi-Wan in the immediate aftermath of episode III as the Jedi had been hunted down and all killed..or were they.  Meanwhile Obi-Wan has journeyed to Tatooine where he'll stay for many years waiting...and keeping an eye on a certain little boy.  Although it is a Scholastic book aimed at younger readers I didn't feel it was written in \\"too juvenile\\" a style and I think even older readers will enjoy the story even if it is a little on the short side.	2005-05-25

The basic (very basic) plot tells of an undercover FBI agent who is trying to solve a series of gruesome murders that are similar, but have been committed by several different people in different locales.  This agent specializes in being able to find connections where others can't, although if the average reader can't see these connections you'd have to be brain dead.  Moore tosses in a lot of Lovecraftian references such as Clark Ashton Smith' Zothique and Robert W. Chamer's \\"The yellow Sign\\" as well as nods to Arthur Machen as well.  Those who are familiar with Lovecraft and those who influence him will roll their eyes at \\"club Zothique\\" and those not familiar won't know what in the hell that Moore is talking about anyway.  It's all a little much.  This is definitely a book for adults with the violence, language and racial slurs made by the FBI agent about blacks.  One wonders where Moore was going with this angle.  It had no bearing on the story at all.  The art by Jacen Burrows was decent but not enough to make me recommend this one.	2005-05-25

Bielski's book relates dozens of stories of hauntings from the Chicago and surrounding areas.  The earliest stories date back to the War of 1812 and Indians who attacked Fort Dearborn, killing the inhabitants and burning it to the ground.  Even today, people still report seeing soldiers in period dress marching about the Michigan Ave. Bridge, the site of the former Fort Dearborn.<br /><br />Archer Ave. is reported to be among the most haunted stretch of roadway in the country with numerous ghosts including the \\"Wailing Woman whose sobbing can be heard by those who passby the Archer Woods Cemetary.  Then there is Chicago's most famous ghost, dubbed \\"Resurrection Mary\\" who made her first appearance in the 1930's.  Mary is a beautiful blonde who would meet men in night clubs, dancing the night away with them, and then ask for a ride home.  When the car approaches the cemetery, Mary jumps from the car and runs through the locked gates and disappears.<br /><br />The Cemeteries of Chicago are replete with ghostly goings on...Rosehill Cemetery on the city's north side is said to be home to more than a dozen ghosts including several little girls.  We all know how scary little girls can be!  This cemetery is home to \\"Gerhardt Foreman\\" an associate of famed occultist Aleister Crowley, whose tomb is chained shut so he cannot get out.  Rosehill is also the final resting place of Richard Sears, founder of the Sears Roebuck Co. who has been seen dressed in best in suit and top hat, walking through the mausoleum where he is entombed.<br /><br />Not to be outdone in the ghost department is Bachelor's Grove Cemetery, a favorite destination for ghost hunters.  This spot, reputed to be a spot where Chicago's gangsters dumped bodies is said to have spectral lights that chase visitors, mysterious 30's era cars that drive about, a woman in white who carries her baby, and a magical house that gets smaller and smaller as you near and eventually disappears completely.<br /><br />One of the eeriest places to visit is Mt. Carmel Cemetery in Hillside.  In 1921 Julia Buccola died giving birth to her baby, and the infant died as well.  Julia's mother had nightmares for several years and finally had her daughters grave exhumed.  When it was opened, all were shocked to see that Julia was still perfectly preserved although the baby had decomposed.  Now visitors will find a haunting photo of the perfectly preserved body on Julia's monument.<br /><br />From Chicago's Field Museum, to the Ghost of Horace Greely who haunts the elementary school named after him and from the site of the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre to Wrigley Field where long-time broadcaster Harry Caray's ghost is said to haunt, this is a fascinating trip through Chicago's ghostly attractions.  Unlike many regional tales of ghosts that are often rather dry reading Bielski relates these stories with a lot of enthusiasm that the readers will certainly share.  I only wish there had been some photographs to accompany her text.

I'm not going to be as extreme as they are but neither can I offer the book a great deal of praise.  Alan Moore has always been a bit of a tough one for me to get a grasp on.  While I have enjoyed his work, I'm not as ready to confer \\"God\\" status on him the way so many others are eager to do.  Yes his run on Swamp Thing and the Watchmen mini-series were both fantastic, but that was nearly 20 years ago as well.  Moore seemingly has always had the free rein to let his creative juices go.  But to me the toughest writing for comics is having to take an established character and stay within editorial guidelines and try and do something with the character.  And no, he didn't do that with Swamp Thing who was a third tier character nearing cancellation for the second time when he took over on Swamp Thing #20.  Want difficult?  Try doing something new and exciting with the Sub-Mariner...<br /><br />What does all this have to do with THIS graphic novel?  Well nothing really.  But just don't tell me it's great just because Alan Moore wrote it.  This isn't a novel at all but rather three illustrated poems.  I'm sure I'm not as deep as Alan Moore and if there is a connection between the three poems, other than its grim, violent, nihilistic view of the world, I just don't see it.  But then again, I'm not a big fan of poetry, either.  The best of the three is \\"Old Gangsters Never Die\\" an ode to 30's era gangsters like John Dillinger and Al Capone.  The book is illustrated by Juan Jose Ryp in a detailed, chaotic style that is reminiscent of 60's and 70's underground comics.  I suppose I liked it a little bit more than the other two reviewers but ultimately I'd say this one should be reserved only for hardcore Alan Moore fans.	2005-05-23

The mere mention of the name can send shivers down the spines of any who grew up in the southeastern Michigan era.  The dark, brooding, mental asylum stood poised at the corner of Merriman Rd. And Michigan Ave. for decades inciting myths and legends about what went on behind those walls.  I can remember as a kid, my older brothers teasing me whenever we drive by about how they were going to drop me off and leave me there.  Then later as a teenager, we'd drive around its grounds late at night on a dare, keeping our eyes peeled for escaped inmates.  This was one scary place!<br /><br />Author Patricia Ibbotson peels away those urban legends in her wonderful and comprehensive history of Eloise which was so much more than I ever knew.  Eloise was founded in the 1830's as a poorhouse in Nankin Twp. Michigan which later became the city of Westland, my home town.  The original log cabin building has once been known as the Black Horse Tavern.  From this tiny, lone structure rose a vast complex of over a dozen buildings that became a city unto itself.  Eloise had its own police and fire departments, its own post office, general store, greenhouses, bakeries and tobacco curing house.  The farmlands it was nestled on grew a variety of crops that were all tended to by the patients and inmates of Eloise.  Eloise even had its own auditorium used by both patients and employees to put on shows.<br /><br />At its peak Eloise housed thousands of patients and inmates, but as I found out, it was much more than just an asylum.  It was the Wayne County General hospital for many years until closing in 1984.  Eloise also was a nursing home, caring for the aged and the infirmed, and boasted a Tuberculosis Sanitarium in the early 1900's as well.  Eloise also continued in its original goal by caring for the indigent.  There is a striking photo of a dormitory as large as a football field, with row upon row of bunk beds for what was termed \\"POGIES\\" or \\"poor old guys\\".  The men could come to Eloise for a roof over their heads and three square meals per day.  While the living conditions may not have been ideal, as Ibbotson points out the alternative today is that they are homeless and on the streets.<br /><br />This fascinating history is told with over 200 archival photos from the 1800's right up until the facility finally close in the 1980's.  I was astounded by the photographs of Eloise's interiors.  Thinking I'd see something out of a \\"B\\" horror film, I instead saw interiors that looked like they were taken inside a posh hotel.  Art deco designs, Tennessee marble walls and columns, and Terrazzo tiled floors adorn the buildings and Eloise took things such as patient's needs for warm, natural lighting into consideration decades before it became the norm.  But you never lose sight of the fact that this was a mental facility.  The buildings that were used to house the inmates are covered in thick, iron bars.  One darkly humorous photo shows three smiling female attendants standing before a table piled with leather restraints; another shows a patient on a table under going electro shock therapy.  Perhaps the most historically interesting photo is that of Bridget \\"Biddy\\" Hughes, who had the distinction of being the first person committed to Eloise in 1841.  She would spend the next 54 years there until her death in 1895.<br /><br />Today, little is left of the once sprawling complex; just an administrative building is all.  Now occupying the land is a strip mall featuring a grocery store, video store, etc, and a McDonalds restaurant.  Eloise may be long gone but the urban legends and tales of hauntings are still passed along by residents of the area today.  What a captivating history of a true Michigan legend.

I mean maybe he's just looking at more dollar signs but he, and many other filmmakers, are doing a great job these days in documenting the making of their films from day one.  Whether it be for a making of book like this or for extras on the eventual DVD release, I think it's wonderful that they are taking fans into consideration.  This book isn't just some fluff piece like some others that's desgigned to make a few bucks.  This is a comprehensive, daily journal book written by Mr. Rinzler who was along for the entire movie-making process from the creation of storyboards and animatics to post-production editing and final touches.  Rinzler lets readers become a fly on the wall to watch the entire creative process unfold.  You'll see first hand the hard work and incredible pressure placed on everyone involved to not only get the movie completed, but to get it done right since this will be the last chance (as far as we know).  Throughout the book there are behind the scenes photographs and conceptual drawings showing the development of various characters from initial renderings to the final, on-screen look.  This is just a fascinating look inside movie-making, well worth it for Star Wars fans or anyone interested in working in film.	2005-05-20

The Transformers Volume 2	Books	5	3	4	N	N	THE SEQUEL SURPASSES THE ORIGINAL	This story takes places two years after the events in G.I. Joe Vs. Transformers Volume one.  The Transformers have returned to Cyberton where the Autobots are stunned to see that Shockwave has gained control of Cyberton and the Autobots are now on the run from his forces.  Back on Earth, the Cobra Commander has a secret Cybertronian technology ace up his sleeve...namely Starscream who was still held on Earth.  Cobra Commander approaches Destro with a plan to use the Cybertronian technology to open a wormhole to the Transformers world and take control of the supercomputer Teletran 3.  With this they can control Cyberton and steal more technology and use it to create wormholes all throughout the Earth to deliver weapons without being caught.  The G.I. Joe team learns of the plot due to a well-placed spy, and tries to stop Cobra but when a stray bullet causes a malfunction in Teletran 3, all Hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Teletran 3 scatters numerous Transformers throughout Earth's timestream and uses it's camouflage mode to lock the robots into vehicle mode that is appropriate to whatever time period they landed in.  Worse yet, the upheaval of the time stream will result in holocaust for the planet Earth unless the Transformers can be recovered and returned to Cybertron within 12 hours.  While Ultra Magnus keeps Shockwave and his forces at bay with an energy field, the Cobra and G.I. Joe members must now form an uneasy alliance to travel into the timestream to return the missing Transformers before the world is destroyed.<br /><br />The teams split into four groups with one group going to 1970's era California complete with pimp daddies and big cadillacs, while another group ends up in mobster infested Chicago of the mid 1930's.  The most interesting scenario is the group that journeys to an Earth 15 years in the future in a post-apocalyptic where Shockwave has led a successful invasion of Earth and humans are enslaved.  Duke, now severely battle-scarred leads a resistance that includes former Dreadnok members and they are aided by a champion Autobot who will come as a bit of a surprise.  The fourth group?  Well, telling you where they end up would be giving too much away but the payoff is well worth it once you read the story.<br /><br />As Shockwave has always been my favorite Transformer I loved to see him front and center as the main antagonist.  This cold, mechanical Decepticon was always far more appealing than the melodramatic Megatron.  It was also interesting to see the Joes and Cobra forced to call a truce and work together.  I especially liked the Baroness and Roadblock teaming together in the 1930's.  Unfortunately these segments are relatively short and it would have been great to see more interplay between the two rival groups.  If there is one minor complaint it's that the whole story is a bit contrived and things happen just to happen without much logic.  That aside, this was a very strong sequel to the first book and I think it was even better due mainly to Shockwave's involvement as well as another group of Transformers who I will leave as a surprise.  .  The art by E.J. Su and Tim Seeley was fantastic and their vision of the future, Decepticon-controlled Earth was truly chilling.

While Archie is now well into his seventh decade (and still looking ever the teen) perhaps the decade most associated with Archie Comics is the 1950's.  It was the era of hot rods, Elvis, and malt shops and Archie and the gang were front and center.  This is the second collection of Archie stories from the 1950's and this one prominently features Betty and Veronica as most of the stories are reprinted from the Betty & Veronica comic series.  This collection features over a dozen stories and also has pin-up pages and cover galleries, displaying those wonderful covers from that bygone era.  The love triangle between Archie, Betty and Veronica is in full vigor in most of these tales, as the girls alternately battle, and dump Archie.<br /><br />Here are just a few of the stories in this latest Americana Series collection:<br /><br />In \\"Model Date\\" from 1951, Betty and Veronica agree to both turn down Archie for a date the next time he asks to teach him a little humility.  But then they learn that Archie is out with Jughead's cousin from New York.  When the find out the model is a man, Veronica schemes to get a date with him.  Then she gets a look at her `model date.\\"<br /><br />\\"Coat of Alms\\" 1955.  When Betty is upset about her old clothes, Jughead goes on a quiz show and promptly wins her a new gown and mink stole.  When she shows up at a dance, Veronica finds herself as the one envious of Betty's clothes for a change.<br /><br />In \\"Kiss and Kill\\" from 1956, Betty and Veronica find out they are both going steady with Archie and want to kill him.  But Jughead uses reverse psychology and tells the girls that it's all their fault that Archie loves them both because they are so beautiful.  Jughead suggests a kissing contest to see who gets Archie.<br /><br />\\"Rage Before Beauty\\" 1957.  Sneaky Veronica `helps' Archie, Reggie, and Jughead pick out a birthday present for Betty by suggesting a hideous outfit in a department store window.  Veronica was so convincing, however, that the plan backfires when the boys end up buying Veronica the awful outfit instead.<br /><br />\\"Crest Fallen\\" 1958.  When Veronica, Archie, and Reggie all trace their family trees back to European nobility, they begin acting snooty to everyone else.  Miss Grundy takes them down a few pegs when her research uncovers the skeletons in each of their family's closets.<br /><br />\\"Never Say Die\\" 1959.  Veronica decides to fight fire with fire by changing her hair color to blonde to woo Archie.

Patrick the Wolf Boy, the brainchild of Art Baltazar and Franco Aureliani is a simply wonderful comic strip and Devils Due has collected the adventures of this lively character into one great 144 page, digest-sized collection with more on the way.<br /><br />Patrick is, well...a wolf boy, with normal parents who love him dearly.  Patrick doesn't talk much outside of a few growls (Rowr!!) here and there which is a large part of the allure of the character.  There's no dialogue balloons needed from Patrick to know what's on his mind.  Patrick is much the same as any other little boy...except for the fur and fangs, of course.  He never met a squirrel that he didn't want to stick his fangs into.  Art & Franco have created a strip that while charming, also has the kind of black humor that Charles Addams used so well in his Addams Family strips.  That's a haughty comparison to be sure, but well deserved.<br /><br />In this collection we get a number of themed strips including Patrick's Christmas special, Valentine's Day Special, Mother's Day Special, and Summer Special.  We see Patrick meeting Santa for the first time and having the reaction that many young kids do...stark-raving terror, but it's not long before Patrick is swiping the beards off the mall Santas and running away.  You'll see Patrick attending his first baseball game and confusing a lady's fluffy bouffant hair with cotton candy.  Patrick also attends his first comic book convention and annoys the Devil's Due mascot.  Patrick's favorite foil, other than squirrels, is the crazy old pajama lady who lives down the street.  Among my favorite strips are those of Patrick in school.  While other kids leave an apple on the teacher's desk, Patrick leaves things like skulls, abnormal brains in jars, and partially eaten rodents.<br /><br />Rarely does a comic strip make me laugh out loud but Patrick is one that pulled the feat off.  The cartooning style is very crisp and clean.  Art and Franco show a great eye for comedic cartoon expressions.  This is a strip that is good enough to be seen daily in newspapers all over the country.  Hopefully we will see that someday.  Highest recommendation!

I would somewhat disagree with the spotlight reviewer who said it was not scholarly enough.  I found it to be quite concise and complete, having read a great deal about Vlad Tepes previously.  There was much more detail about this Machavellian-era ruler than I ever knew about before.  My main problem with the first half of the book that deals with Vlad Dracul is that it is a little bland.  One wouldn't that relating tales of impalings and hats being nailed to heads could be dry but it was.  I was hoping for something a little more lively, no pun intended.<br /><br />We next move into a look at Vampire folklore throughout the world but mainly eastern european lore where the legends of vampires are so ingrained into the culture of those peoples.  Finally we move on to Bram Stoker using Vlad as his basis for Dracula although it's certain that this was not the only influence.  To be sure the gruesome tales of Elizabeth Bathory and other legends played a part in Stoker's tales as well.  It's a short read but fairly complete, a tad dull in spots, particularly those battles against the turks, but an interesting history still.	2005-05-18

It seems to be the opinion of the left that anyone who speaks from the right or on moral issues is a bible-toting, NASCAR watching red neck and frankly it's this back-handed dismissal of millions of Americans that cost the Democrats the last election.  This pidgeon-holing of so many people into a nice, tidy package continues to blow up in their faces.  One need not be a religious zealot to recognize that morals in the country have gone down the tubes.  Zell isn't espousing a Theocracy as many in the left THINK the right is trying to do.  It's all about common sense.  The left tends to hang on every word uttered by ego-maniacal Hollywood types, many of whom have never put in an honest day's work in their lives, while characterizing the President as stupid.  This is what Zell is saying...common sense.  Don't take your leads from over-stuffed celebrities and athletes, many who never went to college and fewer still who actually graduated, who live in million dollar estates in Beverly Hills.  How stupid is that????<br /><br />The country is paying a high price in dollars, lives, and credibility in Iraq but as Miller points out, you don't shy away from responsibility because it's going to get rough.  The Iraq problem was allowed to fester under Clinton until we got to the point we are at today.  One wonders if those that accuse Bush of being another Hussein or another Hitler have actually ever picked up a history book and read about these two men.  And I mean a REAL history book, not one of these revisionist history books.<br /><br />While this is sure to be another book that polarizes people, the message I take is that both the right and the left need to step up to the plate and put the malicious and spiteful politcal infighting behind them.  While I'm not all the crazy about the religious overtones of the book, the messages of honesty, integrity, and decency are one's that we ALL can embrace whether you are a fundamentalist or an atheist.ntegrity, and decency are one's that we ALL can embrace whether you are a fundamentalist or an atheist. <br /> <br />	2005-05-18

The story opens as a group of grand masters hope to stop an ancient prophecy about a baby being born who, upon its 17th birthday, will unleash a beast who has been imprisoned for 1,000 years.  The beast will cover the world in blood and fear, raising a mountain of corpses and turning the seas red with blood.  The attempt to kill the baby fails.  Now forward ahead 17 years to a village where a young man named Bakhong just wants to check out the girls walking about in the village square..  When his voyeurism is interrupted, not to mention his lunch, he turns on the band of village bullies with a martial arts style they've never seen, and dispatches the ruffians in short order.  The fight took him to the rooftops where the young man found something even better to look at...a beautiful girl showering.  Once again he's interrupted in comical fashion by three masters of the Volcano School.  They are flabbergasted that Bakhong is paying more attention to the girl, than to their attacks.  The action plays out in a hysterical, Jackie Chan style way as the three masters prove themselves no match for his eclectic style.  But soon Bakhong discovers he picked the wrong window to be a peeping Tom as it turns out the girl is Danshula, daughter of the Grandmaster of the Moo Young Sook dojo.  What does all this have to do with the ancient prophecy of the prologue?  Well, you won't find out in the first volume, so stick around for the next.<br /><br />\\"Heaven above Heaven\\" is filled with slapstick humor, grand martial arts fights and ominous ancient prophesies.  We are given only hints of what these ancient prophesies entail before we quickly move onto being introduced to Bakhong and Danshula.  The art by Joong-Won Jeon was the real highlight for me.  With lush, detailed linework, shading, and use of zip-a-tone, Jeon's art was somewhat reminiscent of the 1970's and 80's work of Barry Windsor Smith and Tim Conrad, two of my all-time favorites.  There was a magnificent use of perspective that made the fight scenes almost leap off the page as if they were in 3D.  The Manga style seems to be one of not revealing too much too soon to keep the reader salivating for more.  Heaven above heaven certainly succeeds in doing this.  I also enjoyed the way the opening, very dark and foreboding segment was offset by the humor and action in the rest of the book.

Other than haunted houses and perhaps inns, the next building type most associated with hauntings, and certainly the most romantic are those of haunted theaters.  The theater was among the earliest entertainment venues for Americans and even in the wild, untamed West, theaters prospered.  From small community and university theatres to Royal theaters and grand opera houses, author Barbara Smith collects nearly 60 accounts of hauntings throughout the United States, Canada, and the UK in the fabulous book.  The book provides many first person accounts of specters prowling the catwalks and performers still going on with the show decades after their deaths.  Assisting the tales are wonderful photographs, showing many of these theaters in their glory days.<br /><br />Go West, to Tombstone, AZ, sight of the famous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral to visit the Bird Cage Theatre, once frequented by western legends such as the Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, and Wild Bill Hickock where the ruckus of long past poker games can still be heard within its walls.<br /><br />In Toronto, you'll visit the Winter Garden Theatre that closed in 1928.  Over fifty years later the theatre is saved from the wrecking ball by a preservation society who plans to renovate the old place.  When they open the theatre up for the first time in decades, they find the building literally frozen in time.  Set pieces from the last performances are still in place on stage, ticket stubs from patrons litter the floor, and actor's notes are still pinned up in dressing rooms.  And it seems as if former patrons, stage hands, and performers have not left either as seats bottoms fold up and elevators move to floors, all on their own.<br /><br />At Chicago's tiny Music Box Theatre opened in 1929, the current staff is very familiar with a ghost named \\"Whitey\\" who himself was the manager of the Music Box for some fifty years.  Whitey is a helpful spirit, still trying to carry out his duties, so much so that he was given the title of Manager Emeritus.<br /><br />The Ford's Theatre will forever live in infamy as the place where John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Lincoln.  When the original theatre collapsed, a warehouse was built in its place in 1894.  In 1945 the theatre was rebuilt, and recreated using archival photographs which people swear bore the misty image of Booth in them and even today, people hear phantom footsteps and laughter in the replica theatre.<br /><br />The Old Metropolitan Opera House in NY was known to be home to the famous shade of Madame Frances Alda, a renowned Soprano.  When a patron in 1955 complained to the theatre manager about the rude women who was making loud and caustic comments about the performance on stage, the manager told her not to worry, because Madame Alda never stayed past the first act.  The woman was sitting next to a ghost!<br /><br />From the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis, to the Bagdad Theater in Portland, Oregon, this wonderful book relates stories of ghosts both frightful and funny.  Barbara Smith doesn't attempt to prove or disprove these stories.  She is simply relaying the legends and often first-hand accounts of these ghost stories.  It's up to YOU to decide.  The great thing is that these theaters still stand today and make great places to visit for those interested in ghost hunting.

Abhorrent? Disgusting? Distasteful?  It's certainly all of those and I've only begun to find adjectives that fit this trade paperback.  It's certainly a more far more blunt Ellis than most of us are familiar with from past works.  He comes at you hard and fast and slams you over the head with an anvil in the opening pages.  Strange Kiss begins with an out of control car chase through city streets, with no regard for pedestrians an unfortunate elderly man is cut in half literally by one of the speeding vehicles.  The gorgeous, dark-haired woman doing the chasing shoots her quarry dead and then proceeds to cut off her own face and slit her throat.  And that may be the tamest part of the story.<br /><br />William Gravel is a S.A.S. agent, and combat magician doing some deep cover work in the states and visits an old friend, his only friend, in the hospital.  Seems that his friend, Bull, contracted a STD that makes Syphilis look like a common cold, causing his genitals to rot off.  Worse yet something is growing inside his stomach...something that's crawling around and soon tears its way out in the form of hundreds of baby lizards.  Gravel makes a promise to Bull to find out who did this him and take care of him...to put it nicely.  Gravel, along with a hospital pathologist, Leigh Hunt, who examined the bodies from the earlier crash soon find themselves thrown together an uncover a plot that has a primeval, elder god type being, using Pseudo pods in human skin suits to impregnate humans to carry its young.  Gravel has to destroy the hosts and then come face-to-face with the monstrous being.<br /><br />I guess Ellis was going after a somewhat Lovecraftian angle here although I'm sure ol' H.P. would not have approved of the gratuitous nudity and sex that Ellis has on display in Strange Kiss.  My biggest problem with the story is that we have this lengthy buildup with Gravel and Hunt uncovering all of this repulsive evidence about the creatures through 90% of the book and then Gravel basically takes out the creature in a matter of a couple of pages.  Elder Gods have apparently fallen quite a few rungs down the ladder.  My other problem was that there wasn't much of anything given to the reader on the background of this creature.  We know he's very ancient but that's about it.  Some backstory would have been nice.  This seems like a story that Ellis just sort of tossed out there too make people cringe.  The art by Mike Wolfer is competent but not outstanding.  Okay, but not Ellis' best work.this repulsive evidence about the creatures through 90% of the book and then Gravel basically takes out the creature in a matter of a couple of pages.

But cemeteries are among are most important and informative historical locations, especially those from the New England area where are earliest settlers first lived.  Karen takes on a whirlwind tour of 38 cemeteries along the coast of Maine.  She begins with a primer on cemeteries pointing out how in the 1800's cemeteries were major tourist attractions and also provides a bit of history stone-carving styles and epitaphs.<br /><br />At each cemetery detailed, Karen provides information on how to get to the cemetery, notes on the landscape and a brief history of each region noting when the cemetery was founded and its earliest dated tombstones, as well as noting some of the more interesting residents buried there.  The descriptions are helped greatly by hundreds of photographs showing the various styles of stonework.  Since many of the older markers are too difficult to read in the photographs, dozens of epitaphs are re-printed in the book.  In addition to the cemeteries, the book also notes any other destinations of note in the nearby area such as museums, historical homes, etc and even provides the hours of operation and phone numbers.<br /><br />Touring these cemeteries is an enlightening trip back in time to meet many remarkable and courageous men and women who braved incredible dangers from both French and Indian attacks to settle these new lands.<br /><br />In the York Village Burying Ground we find the grave of Jeremiah Moulton, who was just four years old when his parents were massacred by Abenaki Indians.  Young Jeremiah was allowed to go free because the Abenaki found him to be amusing.  It's a mistake they would regret as Moulton would go on to become a vaunted Indian fighter.  He died in 1765 at the age of 77.  And then there is the grave of Samuel Moody, a true hellfire and brimstone minister cut from the same cloth as Cotton and Increase Mather.<br /><br />Off the beaten path is the New Town Cemetery in the tiny town of Arrowsic, population 501.  Buried here is Brig. General Samuel McCobb who was a part of General Benedict Arnold's disastrous expedition into Quebec.<br /><br />In Ancient Cemetery in Beautiful Wicasset, you will find the burial place of Ezekial Averil who was a bodyguard to none other than George Washington and lived until the ripe old age of 95 before passing away in 1850.<br /><br />The harbor town of Machias features the O'Brien family cemetery, founded by Morris and Mary O'Brien in the mid 1700's.  Machias was the location of the first naval battle of the Revolutionary War as Jeremiah O' Brien led a group of men on the successful attack of a British vessel.<br /><br />Cemeteries hold many great stories about the past if we take the time to listen to them.  Whether the cemetery is spread over many acres or perhaps tiny like the Pioneer's Burial Ground with its two dozen markers, this is an informative and fascinating excursion into Maine history.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansontrue hellfire and brimstone minister cut from the same cloth as Cotton and Increase Mather. <br /> <br />Off the beaten path is the New Town Cemetery in the tiny town of Arrowsic, population 501.

Lansdale And Timothy Truman's On the Far Side with Dead Folks	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Short But Gruesome Zombie Ride	Joe Lansdale is one of the best horror writers in the business today and it's great to see someone putting out comic adaptations of his stories.  His graphic and visceral style is well-suited to the comics.  This tale is based on a classic Romero-esque zombie story he wrote called \\"On the Far Side of the Cadillac Desert with Dead Folks\\".  It's sort of a Dawn of the Dead meets Omega Man type story.  Lansdale provides an introduction in the book that features are by Tim Truman, best known for his Grimjack series for First Comics back in the 1980's.  Lansdale touts Truman as the finest comic artist in the business.  That may be stretching things a tad bit but Truman is very good.  Oddly though, while the full page illustrations in this book by Truman are quite gorgeous, the actually story art is somewhat bland and has a rushed look to it.  It's done strictly in black and white with out any grays or even zip-a-tone to give the art and depth or shading and Truman's usual fine line work is missing.<br /><br />The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where a virus was released causing the dead to return to life to feed on the living.  Pretty standard stuff there.  A bounty hunter enters a desert strip club where they actually have nude female zombies as the entertainment.  Their mouths are sealed shut so they can't bite and the sign outside advertises them as \\"perfumed and maggot-free\\".  Nice...The bounty hunter is after a murderer named Calhoun and after a brief brawl, he takes his prey into custody.  While driving through the desert they're attacked by a tank-like vehicle and captured by a band of zombies and fanatical nuns who serve a man who calls himself Lazarus.  This man, we discover, is the one who actually created the virus that spread throughout the world.  He's now using the blood of those not yet affected to try and find a cure.  Lazarus has found a way to control the zombies and they now worship him as a God.  With the help of one of the nuns who knows Lazarus is mad and wants out, the three escape into the desert for the final, grim climax to the story.<br /><br />Like much of Landsdale's work, this is a raw, bloody, and bleak tale.  There's no heroic figures here to root for.  The story is short but intense.  The idea of lap-dancing zombies is thoroughly bizarre but probably quite accurate if a situation like this ever came to pass.  Using a Disney-style theme park as the lair of Lazarus and his zombies was a nice little dig as well.  I'll give the story five stars but I still think the art could have been a bit better, especially having seen Truman do so much outstanding work over the years.  This one is definitely for mature readers.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonows Lazarus is mad and wants out, the three escape into the desert for the final, grim climax to the story. <br /> <br />Like much of Landsdale's work, this is a raw, bloody, and bleak tale.

I'll gladly brave a mid-January's frost to toss some steaks on the grill.  There's just nothing like it.  But still, it's at this time of the year that most people think about grilling and BBQ.  Weber's Big Book of Grilling has been a staple of mine for many years.  Even as a veteran griller I've still found a lot of helpful advice and tips.  You'll find expert advice on grill methods, types of grills, buying meat, herbs and marinades, etc...At over 400 pages and nearly as many recipes, you're sure to find something you like.<br /><br />The recipes range from the staples like burgers to variations like Buffalo burgers with Chipotle mayo, Teriyaki chicken burgers, and bacon mushroom burgers.  The grilled steak tacos are just fantastic as are the fajitas.  The flank steak with Salsa verde is another winner.  Beef, chicken, pork, lamb, seafood, vegetarian, no matter what your preference, this book has a great recipe for it.  Whether you're looking for a hearty brisket to serve a house full of guests or just making an elegant meal for two, you'll find it here.  As much as I consider myself an expert, I always return to Weber's Big Book as a source for great information.	2005-05-11

I actually read this story arc in the Darkness: Original Sin trade paperback.  This book collects issues # 15 - 17 of the original Darkness comic series.  The book is no longer being written by Garth Ennis and that is a bit of a drawback as Malachey Coney doesn't handle dialogue as well but this was still a good story.  We start as an amibitious Cardinal Innocent is sending out the Magdalena, another of those ancient powers/warriors in the Top Cow universe.  She's kind of a holy warrior with the body of a super model (naturally).  He arms her with the ancient Spear of Destiny, the spear which pierced Jesus on the cross which an earlier Magdalena had recovered from Hitler himself.  She is sent out after Jackie Estacado, AKA the Darkness to kill what she has been programmed to believe is one of the ultimate tools of evil.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Magdelena was not prepared properly by taking part in the rituals that she needed to fully use her powers effectively.  As a result, she is beaten badly by Jackie.  Cardinal Innocent manages to find a fall guy in the form of another priest who takes responsiblity before a group of church inquisitors of sending the Magdelena out.  We don't see what happens to the priest, but evidently it's not very pleasant.<br /><br />The art is consistently excellent throughout the story and The Darkness really is an art-driven book as evidenced by two page spreads that you turn sideways ala a Playboy centerfold to view and read.  Not surprisingly the subject of these two page spreads are typically scantily clad women.  While Coney is no Garth Ennis, \\"Spear of Destiny\\" was a strong story with gorgeous art and enough plot to make it interesting.	2005-05-10

Sam, the owner of the bar where Sookie works is shot and other shape-shifters have also been wounded or killed.  Sam needs Sookie's telepathic powers to help track down the the one doing the killing but others are intent on stopping her, nearly burning her alive in her home.  Sookie seeks aid from the Vampire Eric who doesn't remember his liason with Sookie due to amnesia.  Eric sends a pirate vampire to help out who is one of the most interesting characters in the book.<br /><br />Dead as a Doornail is smart, fun, exciting and sexy.  Harris has created a uniquely dark and witty world populated by real characters who just happen to bee vampires and shapeshifters but who have all the problems of regular people.  While I don't normally go for the horror/romance hybrid, Harris' light, but fast-paced and exciting style make the Southern Vampire series rise above so many other books of its kind.  It's not all fun and games though.  Sookie is dealing with a lot of mental turmoil herself with her previous relationships with Bill and Eric not to mention the apprehension over her brother's shape-shifting.  Another great book in the series that gets better and better.	2005-05-10

Actress Jane Seymour and her husband, Actor James Keach, are among the latest celebrities to jump on the children's book bandwagon and are doing so very successfully. They've created a wonderful series of books in which their family of cats stand-in for their own family, allowing them to share their own experiences as parents and at the same time delighting children with the tales of their twin kittens, \\"This One and That One.\\"<br /><br />\\"Fried Pies and Roast Cake\\" addresses an issue that parents of young kids have always faced...the different wants of the kids and keeping them all happy.  It's lunch time and Lady Jane cat asks This One and That One what they want to eat.  Each of course wants a completely different menu.  Mom tells the kids to decide soon.  They ask Dad for help but Dad tells them to work it out.  After much bickering, the kids decide to share and come with a crazy, mixed up menu that mom knows will be unappetizing.  Mom finally suggests taking a couple of suggestions from each of them and making some today and some the next day.<br /><br />Funny and charming, \\"Fried Pies and Roast Cake\\" is definitely the most amusing book by Seymour and Keach.  The kids arguing over what they want is something that most parents can relate to.  The book also teachs kids the value of sharing and compromise and in the end, both sides are happy.  Once again, Geoffrey Planer provides colorful and fun illustrations that make this book a winner.	2005-05-09

Dad finally suggests \\"paint me\\" and thus takes a nap in his chair, leaving the kids to come up with a masterpirce.

Lady Jane cat comes home to find dad still asleep but now with a red face, blue nose, white paws, and brown stripes on his belly.<br /><br />Well I'd say \\"Splat\\" surely addresses the scene all parents have experienced at some point when kids are left unsupervised with paint, or markers, or crayons.  How many of us haven't been shocked to find our walls or bathtubs with brand new artwork that wasn't there a few minutes ago.  That's the charm of these books by Jane Seymor and James Keach.

Milky.  I'm not sure what the genesis of the character is and how exactly Love was involved in the project.  It's somewhat obvious the character of Princess Ai is based on herself or maybe an alternate view of herself.  I'm honestly not all the knowledgeable about Love or her late husband, Curt Cobain so I will review the book strictly on its merits alone without any backstory which may not be necessary anyway.<br /><br />The beautiful Princess Ai finds herself in Tokyo, Japan.  She doesn't know who she is or how she got there.  When she's accosted by a thief, she is aided by a young man named Kent who retrieves her heart-shaped box necklace.  Kent works in the library at Shinjuku University and takes Ai there where a strange book seems to jog her memory just a fraction.  Kent also invites Ai to stay at his home but Ai knows she'll have to earn some money if she's going to find her way in the big city.  Ai learns that Kent is a musician and he soon inspires Ai's own musical talents.  She visits a strip club called club Cupid where she agrees to sing but refuses to strip.  The owner is so intrigued by the girl he hires her, much to the chagrin of the clubs star attraction, Mika.<br /><br />Ai continues to visit the library for more clues to her background and finally discovers her name is Ai and she was a princess in a land called Ai-Land.  She can even picture her father and senses some sadness about her mother.  But how did Ai get to Earth?  What does the mysterious street musician have to do with her?  Ai soon finds herself recruited by the HTA talent agency that won't take no for an answer.  Meanwhile, something else is looking for Ai.  A furie named Tess, a fanged creature with dragon wings and dragon heads that breathe fire.<br /><br />The first Volume of Princess Ai does not offer many answers about Ai's life and background.  We are given only small doses of revelations about the mysteries that surround her, Ai-land, and the evil furie who is hunting her.  Princess Ai is filled with a grand helping of humor as Ai is truly a stranger in a strange land with all of the pratfalls that go along with it.  There's a hilarious scene where a man tries to take advantage of her by wanting to be her \\"sugar daddy\\".  Ai is gorgeously illustrated by Misaho Kujiradou and also written by Kujiradou and D.J. Milky.  Don't read the book or not read the book because of Courtney Love's involvement.  There seems to be some rather divergent opinions on this book because of Love, but this is really Kujiradou's book, anyway.  There's a rapid pace to this Manga that keeps you wanting more.  I'll be interested to see where the story goes in the next volume.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonthe mysteries that surround her, Ai-land, and the evil furie who is hunting her.

We all have our routines and our routines give way to complacency.  Writer/Cartoonist takes a unique approach to these issues in her book \\"Monkey & Spoon.\\"  She uses her stylized, single panel cartoons to focus in on just such a mundane situation in the lives of a couple who have been together for years.  This couple just happens to be a spoon puppet named Isabelle and a stuffed monkey named Jacko.<br /><br />The little tale starts over breakfast and soon develops into an argument.  Jacko wants to know why Isabelle is giving the silent treatment.  Isabelle tells Jacko that he never listens to her.  Now how many of us have not had that very same argument, or one very similar, in our own relationships?  Isabelle told Jacko that he had a string hanging from his sweater and he never did anything to fix it.  Soon though, Jacko starts to lose his stuffing and Isabelle comes to his rescue, putting the stuffing back in and pinning the tear closed.<br /><br />The story is told in one panel cartoons and Simone truly captures the essence of the odd pair's relationship.  Arguments can start over the tiniest of things but are really the result of a greater problem.  In this case, the issue is taking one's partner for granted and not listening.  A colorful, cartoon primer about love and life.  I think many of us can see ourselves in Isabelle and Jacko. Very well done little book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson	2005-05-09

Today, decorating for Halloween is second only to Christmas and is growing every year.  No longer just sprouting up a week before the holiday, today people seem to begin decorating for Halloween as soon as October rolls around.  And with the elaborate displays many people now have, it probably takes that long to finish.  But as Halloween stores pop up each September selling expensive, Hollywood quality props and decorations, people have lost sight of the fact that you needn't break the bank to have a great Halloween display at your house.  \\"Halloween Recipes & Crafts\\" presents 160 pages of fantastic ideas for decorating both inside and outside, along with great recipes and other tips for a memorable Halloween.  The book opens with a short but interesting history of Halloween and then provides tips on party planning and safety.  From there we get into the meat of the book and the fabulous projects you can make at home for little cost.<br /><br />Outdoor D&eacute;cor is the first section and provides a number of projects that were new to me.  One of the most interesting was the freshly dug graves project where you turn everyday plastic garbage bags and a little bit of dirt or soil, to create the look of a freshly dug grave on for your front lawn.  Accent it with a Styrofoam tombstone (which you can also make very inexpensively) some leaves, maybe a fake hand rising out of the dirt, for a truly terrifying display.<br /><br />Another outdoor project utilizes old tin cans, such as soup or even coffee cans.  Painted pumpkin orange, simply punch a series of holes in the can with an awl or screwdriver to make a face.  Place a candle inside the can and hang outside for a brilliant Halloween lantern.  There's also dangling skeletons that can be made with old gallon milk jugs and a scary Halloween ghost flag that can be made for a few dollars.<br /><br />Moving inside, there are more great projects.  Utilize those, unused Halloween masks by simply stuffing them and hanging them inside...or outside...as recently severed heads.  One of my favorite projects is the shrunken heads made out of apples.  Simply peel an apple and apply a solution of lemon juice and salt to prevent browning.  Carve out the apple in the shape of a face and let dry for a couple of weeks.  You can even use marker or paint to further accent these ghastly little decorations.  The highlight for me was a miniature graveyard scene made with a simple sheet of Styrofoam, some Spanish moss, twigs, little stones, and smaller pieces of Styrofoam to make tiny tombstones.<br /><br />The recipes section has all sorts of Halloween themed ideas like deviled egg eye balls or lady fingers made from a half of a hot dog with a red pepper finger nail applied with a bit of cream cheese.  Add raisins to ice cubes for drinks or punch to give the appearance of bugs.  A great idea for adults is to take the traditional bread bowl spinach dip and cut the bread bowl into a jack-o-lantern face.  It would make a great centerpiece for an office party.<br /><br />If you're hosting a party for your children and their friends there's a great chapter featuring a wide display of games like \\"Pin the Mouth on the Pumpkin\\", \\"Encase the Mummy\\", \\"Apple Grab\\" and more that will keep the kids busy and having fun.  The book closes with some tips on costume selection and makeup.<br /><br />The projects in this book are great looking yet very simple and inexpensive to make.  The projects all have a supply list and are described in step-by-step fashion.  Chances are you'll find that you have a lot of the items you need already in your home.  The book is printed on glossy paper and is lavishly illustrated with dozens of photographs throughout.

They want cookies but Lady Jane cat explains that the cookies are for dad to take when he goes fishing.  Off to bed go the kids as mom packs the cookies in a picnic basket.  But the kids cannot get the vision and smell of those cookies out of their heads.  They sneak downstairs and crawl right into the basket and then mom carries it out to dad who is fishing by the shore.  Well, the kittens did a number on those cookies but each saved a big cookie for dad as the book closes with the family dancing on the beach.<br /><br />As with their other books, \\"Yum\\" is very anecdotal in its story relating the very simple stories that all parents experience with their kids.  As our own kids can sometimes be, This One and That One can sometimes be a bit of a nuisance, but they're always adorable and filled with love.

It was some 10,000 years ago...or maybe it was just three, that the Kingdom of Dikay was overrun by the demonic forces of evil until a champion arose to vanquish them and bring peace to the land.  Now, the great champion, the hunter of evil, Van Von Hunter is ready to do battle again against the \\"evil one\\" and recruits an old comrade, his next door neighbor... \\"what's her name?\\"  Well, no matter, fighting evil is her birthright even if she can't remember who she is.<br /><br />Evil is afoot as the Dark Prince returns to the Land of Dikay, intent on retrieving an evil artifact and reclaiming his throne...if he can only remember where to find it.  He's joined by what looks like Elsie the Cow on steroids and a decayed little jester who promises the Prince he can show him how to unleash darkness on the world.  Van and...what is her name...are off on their quest as well because it says to do in the \\"Manual of Exposition.\\"  But before Van can retrieve the artifact he has to face the \\"trials of the sandwich\\" and that is one nasty piece of deli fare that he has to eat and has been putrefying since it was forged a thousand years ago.  Van cleverly diverts the priests who guard the sandwich and hides it behind his back and the Priests now deem him worthy.  Of course they neglected to tell him the artifact had been stolen centuries ago.  And so Van and his comrade, ummm, well her, continue their journey onward, on a collision course with the Prince of Dikay and his forces which include a only a small band of peasants but hey...they're disgruntled peasants.<br /><br />Van Von Hunter was one of the funniest, most entertaining books I've read in a long time.  Filled with bad jokes, worse puns, and riotous slapstick, not everything always works but there's so much that you can't help but laugh out loud over and over again.

You're not going to make a million dollars on eBay by trying to sell your old Beanie Babies or Furbies, that's for sure.  Ginsberg is an unabashed fan of ebay as he sells eBay as much as he sells his own book.

I've been selling on eBay since 1997 and have sold thousands of items but I've always considered it more of a past time than a business.  Ginsberg provides some interesting ideas of setting up shop, however as well as providing tips on listing items, photography, taxes, etc.  But if you're an experienced eBay seller you'll probably be aware of much of this.

Jackie picks up a woman in a bar and takes her back to his place for what he describes as his favorite past time.  But at midnight, Jackie's life is about to change forever. He finds himself under attack by some winged, angelic-like creatures when suddenly his body is gripped by a tremendous power...the power of \\"The Darkness\\".  Jackie uses it to destroy the creatures and finds he can use it to create armor, razor-sharp tendril, and even demonic creatures with this new power.  He finds himself drawn to the Statue of Liberty where he comes in contact with the Brotherhood of Darkness and their leader Lord Sonatine.<br /><br />Sonatine explains that The Darkness is an ancient power much like the Witchblade and the Rapture and Sonatine has been waiting for the power to manifest itself in Jackie for years.  We later find out that the Darkness is passed from father to son at the moment of conception, and that the father dies on the spot.  To his horror Jackie learns that this essentially means no sex...at least NO unprotected sex.  He also learns of The Darkness' ancient enemy, The Magdalene who will stop at nothing to destroy what is essentially her complete opposite.  Jackie learns that it was Sonatine who convinced Frankie Francetti to adopt Jackie when he was just seven years old, knowing that the mobsters influence would be beneficial to Jackie.  Jackie wants nothing to do with Sonatine or his Brotherhood.  To force his hand, Sonatine has kidnapped Jackie's long-time friend Jenny, and now he finds himself caught between Sonatine, and the forces of the Magdalene.<br /><br />This trade collects the first six issues of the on-going series.  The Darkness was written by Garth Ennis who received such critical acclaim for his long run on DC Comics' Vertigo series The Preacher as well as his run on Marvel's The Punisher.  Ennis' hallmark had been a style that was gritty, violent and infused with subtle, black humor.  You do get that in \\"The Darkness\\" but the humor isn't so subtle as much as it seems forced.  It is violent, as Jackie uses his powers for some very clever and gruesome ways to dispatch his enemies.  Unfortunately there isn't quite the development, at least so far, of character and background that we've come to expect from Ennis.  As such the first volume of \\"The Darkness\\" seems to clearly go for more style than substance.

Originally conceived by Hickman as a self-published mini-comic called Holey Crullers, it's been re-created by Top Cow as Common Grounds and features such stalwart artists as George Perez, Al Vey, Sam Keith, Dan Jurgens, and Chris Bachalo.  Common Grounds is a chain of doughnut and coffee shops that caters especially to super types, both heroes and villains.  It's a kind of neutral territory where they can kick back, relax, and small-talk, always observing the no fighting policy in the shop.  Hickman gives us a glimpse at heroes in their downtime, putting a true-to-life spin on characters that have been glamorized for over sixty years.  This 144 page trade paperback presents a baker's dozen of humorous, tragic, and always poignant stories of what it's like to be a superhero.<br /><br />Among the stories in this volume are:<br /><br />\\"Beyond the Speed of Life\\"  A reporter who always dreamed of being a superhero gets a chance to interview the Speeding Bullet inside Common Grounds.  He soon sees that the life of a superhero is not so glamorous as the hero's rapid metabolism forces him to eat almost constantly and spend an equal amount of time in the toilet.  His life is one of loneliness and boredom as he finishes books in a few seconds.  The reporter leaves cherishing his mundane life.<br /><br />\\"Head Games\\"  Mental Midget and one of his arch-enemies the Man-Witch happen to enter the bathroom at Common Grounds at the same time and sit in neighboring stalls.  While doing their business they reflect on life with super powers and share thoughts on everyday life.  Very funny story!<br /><br />\\"Roles\\" Jenny is a waitress at Common Grounds and an aspiring actress whose just been told she can't act by a casting director.  When she stops to help a stranded motorist, Jenny has to play the role of the lifetime when the man turns out to be a psychotic murderer.<br /><br />\\"Time of Their Lives\\"  Two old foes meet in the streets outside the Common Grounds.  One the good looking, retired Commander Power, the other the down and out, and living on the streets Blackwatch, who went to prison when he accidentally killed a superhero.  Appearances are not what they seem in this story of redemption.<br /><br />\\"Fat Chance\\"  Several extremely overweight heroes hold their regular support meeting at the Common Grounds and give their \\"Weight Watchers-esque\\" testimony about their weight problems.<br /><br />\\"Glory Days\\" A hero named Lift-Off attends the 30th anniversary of the forming of \\"Liberty Balance\\" the greatest super team ever.  He uses old trading cards to recognize and remember his former comrades but there's one in particular he's waiting to see...<br /><br />\\"Where Monsters Dine\\" In a magnificent tribute to those off the wall Marvel sci-fi books of the late 50's and early 60's comes this hilarious story of gigantic monsters named Grondar, Crittor, and a dragon named Wang Dang Doodle, who live far from man, lamenting what their lives have become when they no longer are able to terrorize men.

Add to that the book uses among the smallest typefaces ever seen in a novel and it makes for one very difficult read.  It's not a dictionary...USE A BIGGER FONT!<br /><br />Sorry I just could not get into it at all.  Very disappointed.	2005-05-04

Well that's the problem facing Alex Crane in this trade paperback from Devil's Due.  Crane is a loser with a big gambling debt.  His girlfriend Mandy just tossed him out of the house, and some muscleman for a crime boss just did a number on Alex's head giving him 24 hours to come up with the money he owes.  Alex is not having a good day but it's about to get worse.  In desperation, he decides to try and steal some ancient artifacts from the museum where he works.  But when he breaks open a stone sarcophagus, he releases the spirit of an ancient beast, immediately transforming Alex into a ten foot tall legendary beast called the Mantikore.<br /><br />Confused, Alex stumbles out in his beastly new form, having set the museum ablaze.  A voice is in his head, a savage primeval voice.  He soon finds himself defended by a pair of wizards against a team of special-ops type soldier who want him very badly.  Alex is told to walk towards a portal where he finds himself transported to a magnificent city in a world called Abaddon.  A city populated by mythical fantasy creatures like elves, dwarves, trolls, vampires and fairies.  He comes to the aid of a tiny sprite named Molli who is being pursued by Vampires.  When confronted, Alex's consciousness gives way to the savage voice in his head and he makes short work of the attackers and escapes with Molli.  Molli explains that all of the magic has gone out of Abaddon and they now rely on the use of technology supplied to them by a powerful wizard named Archean.  Alex soon learns that this Archean is an immortal, millennia-old wizard who needs the power of the Mantikore to restore his long dead love, Shamat, to life.  Alex soon learns that his girlfriend Mandy has been taken by Archean to force him to turn the power over to the mage.<br /><br />Kore was an enjoyable, quick read.  Not terribly deep, but fun.  It moves briskly along from the opening page with a lot of battles and a minimum of talking.  Writer Josh Blaylock also infused it with a bit of light humor, particularly with the dwarven police.  I would have liked to have seen more depth given to the Mantikore character.  We learn a bit about him in the final pages but much is still unanswered such as how the beast came to find itself imprisoned in the first place and its relationship with Archean in ancient times.  We know that Archean has been trying to restore his love to life for 8,000 years but what has he been doing during all that time?  A little more development of the characters and background would have moved this book up to a five-star rating.  The book is aided greatly by gorgeous artwork from penciller Tim Seeley, and inkers Cory Hamsher and Mark Stegbauer.  Their work along with vibrant colors helped bring this dark fantasy world to life.s briskly along from the opening page with a lot of battles and a minimum of talking.

Crumb Handbook	Books	4	10	12	N	N	TOOK A LONG TIME FOR ME TO TRULY GET IT	Back in the late 1970's, there was this great little comic book shop about a half hours drive from my home.  It was in this little, old time downtown area in a building that had two floors...great old wooden floors that sold old records, movie posters, 8MM movies and books upstairs while the basement was dedicated to comics.  Not too far from Captain America and Spiderman was an \\"adult section\\" that had just a little wait high door that sectioned it off.  I was only 16 but I looked old enough...and there were these comics so unlike the mainstream stuff.  Stuff like the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers and Zap Comix.  Zap is where I saw R. Crumb's work for the first time.  I remember buying a few and actually being a little scared to have them.  I mean they were so counter-culture with the drugs and sex but wow, were they different and were they ever funny!  Crumb has changed a bit from those more carefree days.  He's more socially conscious, that's for sure although I'm sure I missed a lot of the points to his work way back then, concentrating more on the sex part without really getting the underbelly of his work.  Genius is a term that's tossed around to easily these days and I'm not going to confer genius status on Crumb.  The book is a satirical marvel but probably won't have a great deal of appeal to non-Crumb fans or at least those like me who still remember those great underground books of the 1970's.  It certainly brings back some great memories as I really haven't kept up with Crumb that much over the past 20 years or so.  A must read for Crumb fans.	2005-05-03

Voltron was probably the first Japanese giant transforming robot cartoon that many Americans first saw, predating Gobots and Transformers by a couple of years.  Volume 2 of the manga-style book collects issues #1 - 5 of the standard comic series into one volume.  In the first volume, five pilots had been sent to the planet Arus to find the legendary weapon known as Voltron to use in their war versus the alien Drule Supremacy.  When the Supremacy attacks with one of their dreaded Robeasts, the pilots must use the separate Lion robots form Voltron and due battle.  When Sven's robot rejects him, Princess Allura takes his place and Voltron wins the day.<br /><br />As volume two opens, the pilots are helping to rebuild Arus which has been devastated several years earlier by Prince Lotor, son of King Zarkon, Ruler of the 9th kingdom of the Supremacy.  They want to rebuild Arus' defenses and learn more about Voltron.  But others have designs on the giant robots.  Troops from Earth's Galactic Union come to Arus and seize the Voltron lions to return them to Earth for study where scientists hope to duplicate the technology and build their own robots to battle the Drule.  Allura contends that Voltron belongs to Arus and she, and the four pilots led by Keith journey to earth and undertake a daring plot to steal Voltron and return to Arus, defying orders in the process.  They are shocked to learn that already the scientists have been able to replicate much of the technology and built their own robot.  Meanwhile, we find that there is another, insidious reason that Voltron was returned to Earth as a plot is revealed about a high-placed officer conspiring with the evil Drule Supremacy to steal the technology.  The pilots must now battle guards, and the rival robot to make their escape off Earth and return Voltron home.  Meanwhile, Prince Lotor and his Robeasts are waiting for their chance to attack.<br /><br />Manga is so huge these days and there is such a tremendous and eclectic amount of material out there it's difficult to choose a title sometimes.  But with Voltron, you get a character that has been around for 25 years and has a well-known history and following.  Marvel did a short run of Voltron back in the mid 1980's but Devil's Due has brought Voltron back to a place of prominence among the most well-known Japanese creations.  Paradise Lost was briskly paced, exciting, and layered with many sub-plots that make you want to see much more.  The art by E.J. Su, Clint Hilinski, and Clayton Brown was first-rate.  Highly recommended!lectic amount of material out there it's difficult to choose a title sometimes.

Starting with Image, then moving on to Avatar before finding its home at Angel Gate press.  It's not easy trying to categorize Black Tide.  There are characters with super powers who wear costumes but it's not a super hero title really.  Part Sci-fi, part fantasy, with elements of covert intrigue and superhero action, Black Tide is one of the more multifaceted stories I've read in quite a long time.  Trying to summarize the story in a short review would not really do the multi-layered plotline justice, but let me give you a bit of a synopsis.<br /><br />Nearly 13,000 years ago the legendary lost city of Atlantis was destroyed and sunk beneath the ocean, yet its people endured.  Using far advanced technology the people regenerated themselves, building a new home, far below the surface, cloaked from modern man.  It is in this modern world we meet Justin Braddock, leader of a special ops team known as \\"The Deceivers.\\"  All his life he has been haunted by strange nightmares and he's finally about to find out why.  While on a mission he encounters Kaila, an Atlantean and helps her rescue an Atlantean Prince named Theros.  They return to Atlantis where Justin comes face-to-face with the revelation that he had once been Atlantis' greatest enemy, Villonious, responsible for much bloodshed and death.  Villonious had been placed in stasis and was regenerated as a human who should not have had these memories of his previous life.  Queen Celestia decrees that Justin be put to death for his past crimes but Theros intercedes on his behalf since he is the rightful ruler.  He frees Justin, and to Celestia's consternation, Justin, Theros, and Kaila leave Atlantis for the surface world.<br /><br />We then find out that Kaila herself is also a member of the Deceivers as well and Justin never knew it.  They were once lovers in Atlantis but Justin now does not hold those same feelings as he did as Villonious.  Celestia will not give up her son or Justin so easily and allies herself with the Catharta, the witch who stole Theros' powers.  While all this is going on, Justin and Kaila are determined to find out who killed Justin's partner and friend, and also track down terrorists who intend to use a biological bomb at an international summit meeting.  Theros is forced to return to Atlantis to deal with great trouble at home.  The Atlanteans are not happy that Theros freed the slaves before he left and there is rebellion on the rise against him.<br /><br />Whew!  And trust me I'm being brief.  Writer Debbie Bishop has woven a story that is extremely intricate and layered with plots, and sub-plots and even a few sub sub-plots, I think.  It's certainly not a story you can breeze through and I found myself re-reading sections just to make sure I had everything straight.  One thing Bishop does is devote a full page here and there to a character, giving their background, powers, etc, which really helps you get a handle on who is who in the story.  Kind of like a graphic novel scorecard.  The art by Mike S. Miller is first-rate and very smooth.  If you like in-depth, elaborate storylines, then this is unquestionably a book you'll want to read.  It's rare that you get a comic series this complex today.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonot give up her son or Justin so easily and allies herself with the Catharta, the witch who stole Theros' powers.

World War II was over and the nation was enjoying a time of great peace and prosperity.  In the late 1940's, most super hero comics faded from view due to changing tastes.  Furthermore, the crusades against comics in the 1950's and the resulting creation of the comics code authority meant stronger restrictions on comics causing many companies to close up shop, notably EC Comics.  One character who managed to survive not only the changing tastes but the comics code authority was, of course, Archie Andrews.  But even Archie was affected by the new code, believe it or not.  There's a rather funny anecdote in the introduction to this volume about how the staff had make sure all scenes of cleavage were covered up.  It still didn't stop them from drawing Betty and Veronica very well-endowed however.<br /><br />This volume moves Archie into perhaps the era that Archie is most associated with, especially by early baby-boomers; the era when Rock-n-Roll first made its influence known on Archie and the gang...the era of sock hops, malt shops and cruising.  This trade paperback highlights the entire Archie gang in a collection of hilarious and nostalgic stories, brimming with 1950's allure.  Here are a few of my favorite stories from this volume:<br /><br />\\"Winner Lose\\" Archie Comics #64 1953.  Archie buys a beat-up boat to compete with Reggie in a big race.  Veronica promises all of her boat dates to the winner.  Archie comes out the victor but when Jughead crashes the boat, Archie finds he's won the battle but lost the war.<br /><br />\\"Safe at Home\\" Archie Comics #64, 1953.  Archie visits Veronica while Mr. Lodge is hosting several potential investors for a new venture.  Archie thinks the men are planning to rob the Lodge safe and calls the police.  Mr. Lodge is NOT amused!<br /><br />\\"Skip, Hop & Thump\\" Laugh #75, 1956.  The first sock hop in Riverdale as Archie explains the concept of the sock hop to Betty & Veronica.  The pair compete over the boy's socks but when they can't get into the sock hop, they have a rude welcome waiting for Archie.<br /><br />\\"Going, Going, Gown\\" Laugh #80, 1957.  Veronica is bragging about her expensive new gown from Paris that she intends to wear to the big dance.  She then finds out that Betty is going to wear an exact copy of the dress that she bought locally.  Mr. Lodge gives Betty $50 to buy a new dress.  When Veronica shows up at the dance to impress Archie, he is not there.  He and Betty are out spending Mr. Lodge's money!<br /><br />\\"Wheels of Progress\\" Laugh #98, 1958.  Archie is embarrassed when his aunt gives him a pair of roller skates for his birthday.  Betty and Veronica offer to teach him how to skate but he is reluctant...until he gets a look at the blonde bombshell skating instructor!<br /><br />\\"Like Real Gone\\" Laugh #104 1959.  In a bit of an end of the era type story, Archie and Jughead bid goodbye to the 1950's by acting like beatniks replete with all the beatnik jargon.<br /><br />\\"TNT Hee\\" Archie #106, 1959.  Mr. Weatherbee thinks that Jughead has invented a powerful new explosive formula in the chemistry lab.  He's so excited that he contacts Washington.  But it turns out that Jughead was just trying to make nail polish for Veronica.<br /><br />In addition to the wonderful stories there are great pages re-printing many of the classic covers from the 1950's.  It's a treat to look back at these fifty year-old stories and see how the characters and fashions changed with the times.  A real treasure trove for Archie fans.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonconcept of the sock hop to Betty & Veronica.

William is about to find out in a very sudden and powerful way.  William has a lot of guilt on his head.  Some of it warranted and some not.  Years ago he and his friends pulled what they thought was going to be an innocent prank on a drunken fisherman down by the docks.  They untied his boat and let it drift away...and the fisherman was never heard from again.  Now as an adult he's not making life any easier on himself.  He's sleeping with Delia, the wife of his best friend, Aaron. And he also feels the guilt, although misplaced, over his parent's breakup when he was just a child after finding his father having sex with the babysitter.<br /><br />Then one day his conscience crawls out of a hole in the ground for a little retribution in the form of the very same fisherman.  People think William is nuts as he argues with the man since he is the only one who can see him.  William tries to run, but you can't run from your conscience.  William's past sins hit him full in the face and when he cannot dispel this phantom fisherman, he does the only thing he can do...the right thing and finally confronts his demons.  Only this will clear the weight from his soldiers and send the fisherman back the hole.<br /><br />You never know what you're going to get when you open a book from Top Shelf which to me makes them one of the more intriguing comic publishers today.  They are so outside the box and doing edgier, non-traditional type things and giving writers and artists a forum that they otherwise may not have.  Maz Extes isn't a great artist but his impressionistic style is well-suited to the story he tells in \\"Hello Again\\"  He communicates a genuine sense of sincerity and pain with William and the fisherman and you feel a great deal of sympathy for William by the end of the story.  Very well-done little graphic novel.	2005-04-29

His art, while somewhat crude and unpolished is very reminiscent of the kind of small and self-published comics that were prevalent in the late 1980's and early 1990's.  Kudos to Top Shelf for giving people like Brown a forum for their work.  It's this kind of eclectic variety that makes Top Shelf so interesting.  This little (smaller than a regular paperback) is a collection of panel strips which I assume draw on real-life experiences.  Some are funny, some are, serious, and some are even pointless, but then again, that really is life, isn't it?<br /><br />There is a wide diversity of themes in the book.  The first is just called \\"My Brother knows kung-fu\\" as we see the brother in question demonstrating his martial arts skills in various situations including on a locked door and escaping a spanking.  And this is really what goes on throughout the book.  Random strips about life, relationships and things as mundane as biting one's nails to short, watching TV, shoveling snow, fidgeting around at church, etc...Jeffrey Brown's observations really call to mind the commonplace routines in all our lives and noting with some skepticism just how ordinary life can be.  Not everything works in the book.  Not everything intended to be funny hits the mark.  I'm sure the somewhat crude art style will put some people off but all in all it was an enjoyable little read.	2005-04-29

Brown's childhood friend Nigel is now the chief drug kingpin and owes his freedom to Lorenzo who didn't rat him out when he went down years earlier.  But the temptations are all around him and Lorenzo constantly looks for support from his parole officer, Rachel Lopez.  Lopez is a ball-buster but she's also generally concerned with Lopez and wants to see him turn his life around.  Lopez however has her own problems to deal with.  She's an alcoholic and her nightlife tendencies for casual sex are taking a heavy toll on her personal life.  When war between Nigel's gang and a rival breaks out, Lorenzo and Rachel are caught in the middle and Lopez finds herself having to rely on his street sense to help them as their roles become reversed.<br /><br />The book was a bit on the short side but was tough, gritty and filled with mesmerizing characters.  The interplay between Lorenzo and Rachel felt genuine and the book has some outstanding dialogue.  Despite the problems that the two have and all of their skeletons, you find yourself rooting for them for trying to rise above the filth of their surroundings.

But when the mother bird sees Owly, she immediately goes on the offensive, knowing that owls are predators.<br /><br />Owly and Wormy decide to build the birds a birdhouse and even sacrifice their wooden wagon to make one large enough.  They are proud of their work but still the mother bird is having none of it.  Owly then thinks he's figured it out and paints a small little welcome sign on the front of the birdhouse.  But Owly and Wormy are disappointed when they find the sign lying on the ground, broken in half and mother bird again going on the attack and driving Owly away.  The friends are distraught and take the birdhouse back to Owly's tree and put it away in the closet, seemingly for good.  But now the poor bird family finds themselves shivering and wet from the cold.  A nice house sure would be great!  When a storm blows three new baby birds out of the nest, Owly comes to the rescue but the third is still missing.  Can Owly and Wormy locate the missing baby bird?  How will mother bird treat them now?<br /><br />Owly is not so much a graphic novel in the traditional sense but truly a wonderful children's book told solely through cartooning.  We see the value of friendship and never giving up when it comes to helping others.  And we also see the pitfalls of judging people too hastily.  Andy Runton's unique cartooning style drives the book.  At once very simplistic and yet able to express such a wide range of emotions from all his characters.  This book is pure charm and shows the incredible talent that is out there among the smaller press community.  Another winner!mmunity.  Another winner! <br />	2005-04-28

I've only been a Fox Trot fan for about a year or so but it's quickly become my favorite comic strip and the only one I make sure I read every day.  Bill Amend has a perfect style tailor made for animation and I'd love to see a Fox Trot show or special.  Jason, of course is my favorite but the entire cast is just a riot.  My favorite part is the \\"ink Outtage\\" storyline following the blackout in 2003.  The description says East Coast power blackout but I'm in Michigan we had it too...thanks a lot, Ohio!  The Lord of the Rings strips are great as well.  Like the other reviewer said though, at 128 pages it is pretty short although $8.95 is not a bad price.  I'd still rather see maybe double the pages for $15 or so.  Great Strip!	2005-04-27

While the first volume of \\"The Best of the Forties\\" concentrated on presenting the first appearances of Archie and the rest of the gang, the second volume is strictly slapstick.  All of the stories from this volume are reprinted from Laugh Comics while the first re-printed stories from Pep, and Archie comics.  The girls take a bit of a back seat in these dozen stories as Jughead becomes the main co-star.  Even Mr. Andrews gets more strip time than Betty and Veronica.  The stories are more slapstick, than other Archie stories relying on a lot of physical humor.  While maybe not as historically important as the one in volume one, these stories present a side of Archie rarely seen by us baby boomers who were so used to adventures centered on Riverdale High and the ongoing love triangle.  In this regard, the stories are less time-sensitive and could easily be dropped into modern times as references to current events of the 40's are kept to a bare minimum.<br /><br />Among my favorite stories are:<br /><br />\\"Mr. Blunk Comes to Town\\" from Laugh #21.  Archie's dad is, of course, a real estate agent and a man named Mr. Blunk comes to town to buy a seemingly worthless plot of land.  Unfortunately, Archie takes the contract out on his date by mistake.  Through a series of car breakdowns and other mishaps, Mr. Andrews and Archie keep missing each other which turns out to be a good thing as Mr. Andrews soon learns that oil was found on the land and Blunk knew about it all along!<br /><br />\\"Go Fly a Kite\\"  from Laugh #23.  Archie and Jughead are trying to build a kite and their racket disturbs their fathers.  Soon Mr. Andrew and Mr. Jones take over building the kite with disastrous results.<br /><br />\\"Double Trouble\\" From Laugh #25.  Archie wonders why the new girl in school, Alice Adams changes from nice to mean to him at the drop of a hat.  What Archie doesn't know is that the girls are twins!<br /><br />\\"It's a Dog's Life\\" from Laugh #27.  Archie and Jughead agree to bathe Veronica's dog.  Jughead grabs hair remover instead of shampoo by mistake resulting in a hairless pooch right before the big dog show!<br /><br />\\"Lady Killer\\" from Laugh #28.  Archie decides to start an escort service to earn some extra money.  He doesn't want to be recognized as a kid so wears a beard and dark hair to disguise himself.  His first customer named \\"Peaches\\" turns out to be Miss Grundy!  The pair go out to a nightclub and Archie has to dodge Reggie and Veronica who are there as well.<br /><br />\\"Nature Boy\\" from Laugh #36.  Archie, Jughead, Betty and Veronica go out on a picnic and in wild slapstick fashion, virtually everything goes wrong from Jughead smashing a cake, to Archie burning the burgers, Betty and Veronica sitting in poison ivy, and Jughead playing with a skunk!<br /><br />While maybe not as historically important, these stories were very funny and a change to those of us who only knew Archie from the 60's and 70's.e to bathe Veronica's dog.

Joe comic book back in 1982, the same year Hasbro rolled out the new 3 ¾\\" line of Joe action figures.  The series was a big hit and would be one of Marvel's top sellers for many years and spawn several companion titles such as G.I. Joe Special Missions and G.I. Joe European Missions.  But as the popularity of the toy line waned, so did the popularity of the comic and the title was finally canceled in 1994 after 155 issues.  G.I. Joe lay dormant for seven years until resurrected by Devil's Due in 2001.  \\"G.I. Joe Reinstated\\" re-prints those first four issues where we see the Joe team brought out of the mothballs to once again face off against arch-nemesis, Cobra.  But this was not the G.I. Joe of twenty years ago which was squarely aimed at the young boys who played with the action figures.  This was a grittier, edgier Joe, fully immersed in our modern world of terrorism and 9/11.<br /><br />Reinstated begins deep in the Florida Everglades at the base of Dreadnok leader Zartan.  Zartan hosts a meeting of Cobra dignitaries including the Cobra Commander, the Baroness, Major Bludd, Destro, Dr. Mindbender, Tomax, and Xamot.  These diverse and ego-maniacal personalities instantly begin squabbling over power as the Cobra Commander presents Cobra's newest weapon...nanite technology which he claims will infect and destroy virtually anything it's introduced into, whether it's mechanical or organic.  Destro manages to usurp power and imprison the Cobra Commander.  But military has been keeping an eye on Zartan in the form of Snake Eyes' apprentice Kamakura, who relays his information to Joe command.  After seven years the Joe team is reassembled with Duke, Flint, Scarlett, Snake Eyes, Roadblock, Shipwreck, Gung Ho, Mainframe, Spirit, and more...We catch up with the Joe team and learn that Snake Eyes and Scarlett were to be married but Snake left three weeks before the wedding. We also learn rather humorously that Bazooka is no longer quite fit for active duty.<br /><br />The Joe team begins their assault on Zartan's base but it is all a ruse to draw the Joe team in.  Scarlett and Snake Eyes are captured and several members of the Joe team, including many new recruits are infected with the nanites.  Furthermore, Cobra has begun infecting infrastructure in the U.S., hitting government installations, communications networks, and other targets, resulting in widespread damage and chaos.  Cobra's plan is then to play the good guy and save the day so the government will be in their debt. The Joe team must now find a way to battle this new technology and save the men and the nation from Cobra's latest threat.<br /><br />Reinstated was an extraordinary story and a great way to bring back the Joe team.  Far from the more implausible Marvel stories, Reinstated handled the seven year absence logically with the various Cobra members quibbling over power. Meanwhile on the Joe side we are given some meat to the past seven years that the Joe team had been disbanded.  While it would have been great to see a bit more of what's happened to the team in that time, it was at least nice to see the subject handled intelligently.  And in a plot right out of today's headlines we hear that people are protesting in Washington over the Joe Teams attack on the Cobra base.  Kudos to Josh Blaylock for playing up the whole sympathizing with the terrorists angle as many people today have done with Al-Quida.  Steve Kurth and John Larter provide the striking artwork putting the finishing touches on this great trade collection.  Devil's Due had done a great job of balancing staying true to the characters Marvel and Hasbro introduced and updating them for 21st century readers.  I like having the stories aimed at a more mature audience than the \\"G\\" rated Marvel material.  Clearly, G.I. Joe is in good hands at Devil's Due.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonactive duty.      The Joe team begins their assault on Zartan's base but it is all a ruse to draw the Joe team in.

The biggest thing I took away from Scarecrows is that they are not just for Autumn or Halloween.  There are designs in this book that can be made for any season or even as permanent decor throughout the entire year.  Felder Rushing starts off the book with a short, but enjoyable history of scarecrows covering it's uses throughout the world and in early America as well.  Add to that some background on their nemesis the crows, who were used as messengers in both Greek and Norse mythology.  From there we move to the meat of the book, scarecrow design.<br /><br />Rushing provides easy, step-by-step instructions, including lists of needed materials, to make all of the designs in the book.  We start with a very basic and traditional scarecrow using the simple \\"cross\\" design with two wood poles intersecting like a crucifix for the frame.  From there you choose your head whether it's an old pillow case, burlap sack, paper bag, or any number of other options.  I wouldn't suggest a paper bag if it's going to be outside in the elements for any length of time.  For Halloween time you can even use a pumpkin as the head, designing and cutting out a chilling face to scare trick-or-treaters. Next, deck him out in some old clothes, stuff with hay, or old newspaper, plastic bags or even more old clothes to fill him out.  Use an old mop. Foam, pipe cleaners, yarn or felt for the hair.  The great thing about these designs is the flexibility of materials.  It's almost guaranteed that you will have everything you need right at home to make a scarecrow.<br /><br />After the basic scarecrow we move on to more complex designs with different materials.  How about making a beautiful garden queen for the garden, just right for the coming spring?  You can make pose them in different positions by stuff the arms and legs with rolled up chicken wire than can easily be bent to make your scarecrow come alive and also serves as secure stuffing.  You can make your own tin man scare crow from various sizes of tin cans that can be taped, glued, even strung together.  You can do the same with clay pots for a very unique design.  Among the most complex, but striking designs are those created by Michael Melle, and artist from Massachusetts that begin with a thin wooden or metal frame. Next the various limbs are tightly wrapped with hay or straw, all the way down to their fingers to create some very eerie straw people which would be ideal for Halloween.  These are certainly more time consuming but also still quite simple.<br /><br />All the designs are accompanied by brilliant color photography including many full-page photographs.  Simple, fun, and inexpensive are perhaps the best three words I can used to describe this book.  Whether you want to go strictly traditional or add some incredible flair, you're sure to find a design that you'll love in this book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonthat can be taped, glued, even strung together.

I've only been listening to Michael Savage for a year or so but I find his no nonsesne, and yet common sense apporach to be so fresh.  I know a lot of people just want to shoe-horn Savage into the same convenient square hole as people like Limbaugh and others but Savage \\"gives it\\" to conservatives as much as he does liberals. Well okay, maybe not, but Savage certainly isn't afraid to call cons on the carpet.  he clearly thinks that the Bush administration has not done enough in the war on terrorism and homeland security.  But ok, clearly he saves most of his vitriol for liberals and points out with clear, concise examples and not just bluster.  The ridiculously liberal  immigration policies that allow immigrants to steal American jobs meanwhile Libs rant about jobs being farmed out to India and China.<br /><br />Make no mistake, of all the conservative pundits, Savage may be the most intelligent and well-spoken.  His commentaries on the ACLU are classics.  Savage doesn't just rail and rant but also provides solutions.  Quite a change from so many of the political books out there today.  This is another winner from a man who genuinely cares for America.	2005-04-25

TV and film have romanticized the men who are able to profile serial killers.  Men who are able to get inside the heads of these criminals and know their motivations and use those to track and eventually capture them.  But what is the emotional toll for dealing the the day-to-day horror of this job?  It's hardly glamorous.  They've seen things and more importantly, have to solve things that would drive the average person to flee in stark terror.  Roger Depue wasn't just a profiler, he was one of the profilers of the science.  He is the one who helped write the book on the science of tracking these people down.<br /><br />His accounts are exciting, horrifying, fulfilling, and deeply depressing.  This was work so overwhelming that DePue actually left the world behind for a few years and joined a seminary.  I was deeply moved and deeply horrified by the book.  This is the true to life tragedies that TV and film never take you to.  The real thing.  Highly recommended.	2005-04-25

Bladderwhack Pond that is and unfortunately they just don't fit in with the other young fairies from Penstamen who have the best hairstyles and wear the best fashions.  Chloe in particular is a butt of the jokes from the Penstamen `clique', especially Monica who never lets Chloe forget she is an orphan.  To make mattes worse, an evil little Fairy, Mr. Snivels, has broken the dam causing Bladderwhack to be flooded, including the school, forcing Chloe, the inquisitive Tip, and the chubby little Darling, to have to attend school in Penstamen.  Could things get any worse?  You bet they can!<br /><br />Chloe constantly finds herself running into Prince Peter, sometimes literally, and Peter seems to like Chloe, much to the agitation of Monica who is dying to meet the Prince.  A chance find of a History of the Heatherworld book convinces Chloe that the ancient prophesies are already in motion and that a secret entrance to the Heatherworld, the realm of the Wicked Witch Halga, is located at the bottom of Bladderwhack Pond.  Chloe is convinced that she will find her long-lost mother somewhere in the Heatherworld and the three friends now begin a perilous journey, encountering fire-breathing Dragons, hordes of trolls, hungry crows, and the evil witch Halga herself, in order to uncover the ages-old mystery and reveal the truth about Chloe and her past, once and for all.<br /><br />The Fairies of Bladderwhack Pond is an honest-to-goodness fairy tale but updated for modern times.  We see the young fairies Chloe, Tip, and Darling, facing the problems of peer pressure and humiliation when they are not able to dress as nicely as the more upscale Periwinkle fairies.  So with this book you really get an old-fashioned fairy tale told with today's tribulations.  It's a light, fun read, filled with humor, wit and charm.  While any kids in the 7 - 14 age range would enjoy the story, I think it especially speaks to young girls who can relate more keenly to the problems endured by the main characters.  The book is beautifully illustrated by Andy Park and features a number of full-page illustrations that perfectly complement the story written By Debbie Bishop.

While I found it well-written and illustrated, and certainly provocative, I have to admit that I disagree with its politics and its agenda.  I suspect that like many of the recent political releases such as \\"What's the Matter with Kansas\\" and Ann Coulter's \\"How to Talk Like a Liberal\\", opinions on this graphic novel will be split along party lines.  While there is an attempt to make the book somewhat bi-partisan, it's clearly anti-Bush and anti-conservative and makes no bones about it.<br /><br />In the story, President George W. Bush becomes President Henry R. Birch.  Okay, two points for renaming the President after the ultra-conservative organization that was founded in 1958.  Birch has just one re-election and at his inauguration, one of his aides, Manny Perez steps to the podium and begins telling all in attendance how Birch stole the election with rigged voting machines and rants on about how the people do not have a say in their own democracy.  Perez is then shot dead by a secret service agent.  Now reverse time several months as noted novelist Thomas Womack and Perdita Orozco of the Santa Fe Institute think tank are first approached by Perez with the evidence of vote tampering.  The pair begin a grass roots campaign that they dub \\"OneLove\\" (how very cute) to begin getting the message out to the masses about \\"The Evil Empire\\" that is the Birch administration.  They toss out every ridiculous liberal conspiracy theory concocted such as the one about Osama Bin Laden already having been captured secretly so Birch can use it for political gain.  And then there is talk about reinstituting the draft which to my recollection, only came out of the Kerry camp in the last election as a scare tool...and one which ultimately failed.  Of course the OneLove campaign catches on and after the death of Perez we get a nicely wrapped, fairy tale ending.  I was expecting to read, \\"And they lived happily ever after\\" as the last line in the story.<br /><br />Throughout the book there's a lot of talk about how the American Dream has been stolen and people feel helpless like they don't have a voice.  It's straight out of the liberal playbook.  Frankly, I know that myself, as well as most other I know, are better off now than we were six or eight years ago.  Of course, if you try and say that you're labeled as a selfish and self-absorbed neo-con and told how it goes against my \\"Christian beliefs,\\" as if all conservatives were bible-toting Evangelicals.  It's an argument I've had once too often and now I just sigh and carry on.<br /><br />I appreciate the passion of the writers Steven and Dan Goldman and I like them putting their money where their mouths are and doing...rather than just talking about it.  I commend their efforts even if I disagree with their message which is why I'm giving the review four stars.\\" as the last line in the story. <br /> <br />Throughout the book there's a lot of talk about how the American Dream has been stolen and people feel helpless like they don't have a voice.

The rapture is another ancient artifact along the lines of the Witchblade and The Darkness, also from Top Cow.  Tom Judge is a drunken, former priest.  He left the church when his advice to a man resulted in the man killing his wife and children brutally.  Tom comes into possession of the Rapture, a necklace with a symbol similar to a Knights Templar cross.  This allows him to become the physical manifestation of the biblical rapture, having to do with the End of Days and Christ's return.  Judge finds all this out from Tilly Grimes, a former government agent who's just blown up Tom's apartment.  Grimes warns Tom that the end of Days is coming and that he can prevent it.  Tom meets Nick, aka the Devil.  The devil reveals some secrets to Tom, most notably that EVERY person, no matter how good they may have been in life, goes to Hell.  Souls are like money or stocks in Hell.  The more souls you possess, the more powerful you become.  But on a somewhat sympathetic note, the souls also ease the torment of demons which is why they strive so hard to get them.<br /><br />Nick also reveals that he's given up his throne in hell to become a human.  His departure leaves a foreboding void in Hell as the remaining demons and angels from above vie to control the infernal realm.  Tom now knows two things.  First, that he is fated to be the one person to decide the balance of power in hell.  Second, Tom finds that he can free souls from hell by giving them hope. Grimes' former superior Mr. Black wants the Rapture for himself.  He's dealt his soul to several different demons and has no intention of giving it up.  Through the use of powerful technology, and an army of loyal demons, he's developed a plot to claim Hell and the necklace for his own.  Tom & Tilly, along with a group of eclectic followers to must figure out a way to stop Mr. Black and save existence.<br /><br />Back in the 1980's during Alan Moore's brilliant and terrifying run on Swamp Thing there was a story he did in Swamp Thing Annual #2 where Swamp Thing must journey to hell to recover the soul of Abigail Arcane.  It was the most terrifying, and maddening views of hell ever laid out in a comic book, or anywhere else for that matter.  It was a bleak world of despair and hopelessness.  Tom Judge: The Rapture has managed to surpass that desolate exhibit.  The Hell of this story is all the more dismal knowing that it is the fate of all men and that souls are gathered up like a vacuum gathers confetti after a party.  Going one step further, writer Paul Jenkins infuses his Hell with a acerbic bit of humor as we see a demonic stock exchange where the souls of school teachers, Mother Superiors, and southern televangelists are traded like commodities.  It's a Hell where Charon, the boatman to the River Styx now drives a taxi.  Jenkins also introduces one of the more mysterious characters of the book, the Conductor, who carries souls and demons aboard a train to the seventh layer of Hell from which no one has ever returned.<br /><br />It's important to have art that captures the feel of such a place and such a story and Clayton Crain and Jonathan Glapion due a masterful job.  The demons they bring to life are chaos personified.  And I must also give a nod off to the colorists who worked on the book as their work perfectly complemented the art in capturing that feel of dread and gloom.  I hadn't read this title in its comic form so it was a joy to sit down and read the entire story at once.

Zombies are just plain popular right now what with films like 28 Days later, the Dawn of the Dead remake, and Romero's new film \\"Land of the Dead\\".  Zombies in many ways represent the ultimate horror as single-minded, almost a hive like existence whose sole purpose is to devour the lving...while they are still living.  That's just a tad more provocative than being bit by Dracula while you're sleeping, I'd say.<br /><br />Kirkman uses Romero's influence as his zombies are slow and shambling as opposed to the jack rabbits of the Dawn remake.  Since you really can't tell any zombie story from the zombie's point of view you naturally can only focus on the survivors and their grasp of the situation.  The story does borrow from 28 Days Later as a cop named Rick Grimes, wakes up in a deserted hospital and very confused.  he meets a couple of other survivors who give him the lowdown on what's happened in the world.  He heads to Atlanta to try to find his family  but instead finds the city overwhelmed by the undead flesh-eaters.  He eventually arrives at a small camp of survivors where he miraculously finds his wife and son.  From there we focus primarily on the relationships of the various survivors.<br /><br />Tony Moore's art is a bit 'cartoony' for my tastes. It's almost like a movie storyboard and I would have liked have seen a more grittier look to it.  Not saying that the art is bad, mind you...he does render some pretty decayed looking zombies.  As a zombie fan I really enjoyed this first trade collection of the comic series.  Kirkman sticks to the core zombie roots and produces a strong storyline.	2005-04-22

Back in the 1980's Marvel comics had the license to produce comic books based on the two hottest selling toy lines: G.I. Joe and the Transformers.  So it seemed like a natural that the two toy juggernauts should eventually meet and thus in 1987 Marvel gave the world the four issue mini series G.I. Joe & The Transformers.  Reflecting the times and the fact that it was aimed at the kids who played with the toys, the story and art were very simplistic.  Now, seventeen years later Devil's Due has the license for the G.I. comics while Dreamwave (now out of business) was doing Transformers.  The companies combined for two different series between the two toy lines each collecting them into trade paperbacks.<br /><br />The Devil's Due book, \\"G.I. Joe Vs. The Transformers,\\" takes a unique approach as they re-imagine the history and backgrounds of the two groups and intertwine their origins.  In this new continuity, Cobra who is still unknown to the world, finds the Ark, the spacecraft that brought the Transformers to Earth millions of years ago.  They first think the Transformers are mere robots but soon discover they are sentient.  They remove several of the robots and Dr. Mindbender figures out a way to control the Transformers so Cobra can force them to do their bidding.  Megatron is essentially imprisoned in his gun form and worn by the Cobra Commander.  Cobra uses the Transformers to attack a summit meeting that is being guarded by the U.S. Army who is no match for the Giant Robots including Starscream.  But several of the Transformers seem to be malfunctioning including Optimus Prime, the Autobot leader.  Megatron informs the Commander that he's not malfunctioning, but resisting.  We actually see Snake-eyes as a soldier and it is in this attack that his face is disfigured and he soon dons the familiar ninja attire.  As Cobra announces its presence to the world, the U.S. military creates the G.I. Joe force to counter the threat including Scarlett, Mainframe, Flagg, Snake-eyes, and others.<br /><br />When the Joe Force is attacked again by Cobra, help comes in the form of two Autobots who were left behind by Cobra: Bumblebee and Wheeljack.  They reveal that the Cobra attacks are meant to obtain the materials to make Energon, the Transformers power source.  Furthermore Optimus Prime has managed to get a message out to the Autobots revealing the secret Cobra base and now the G.I. Joe Team and the Autobots prepare themselves for all out war versus Cobra and the Decepticons!<br /><br />Transformer and G.I. Joe purists may have a problem with the changing of long-established continuity but if they do I chalk it up to stodginess.  First, I don't think it's meant to be viewed as a change in continuity but rather as an alternate view in order to effect the teaming of these two forces in a logical manner that fit well with the plot as opposed to the hack job that Marvel did nearly 20 years ago.  The bottom line is that this is just an exciting and fun story.  The idea of Cobra locating the crashed Ark and controlling the Transformers (at least for a little while) is positively brilliant.  I also like the way Josh Blaylock and Dan Jolley have given us a story that is edgier and fits well with what Dreamwave had been doing with the Transformers as opposed to the \\"G\\" rated stories of Marvel Comics.  The art of Mike Miller is excellent, particularly his rendering of the various Transformers, especially Soundwave who's never looked better or more menacing.  Kudos to the colorists as well; I remember the days when Soundwave would often look purple instead of blue!  Joe fans will be please to see many of their favorites like Destro, Zartan, Firefly, and The Baroness.<br /><br />Complaints?  Not many.  It might have been nice to see some of the other famous Transformers like Shockwave or the Dinobots but you understand there has to be a cutoff point somewhere.  All in all this was a great book and I highly recommend it for both G.I. Joe and Transformer fans.	2005-04-22

She doesn't disappoint in her latest thriller Deep Freeze.  People may be getting tired of the serial killer theme but if done effectively, I can read them all day long.  Jackson is very effective at tossing out red herrings and detouring your thoughts on what's going to happen next.  She also builds the tension througout quite well.  i would strongly disagree with reviewer who said there were \\"too many characters\\".  There's no such thing as too many characters if you have ones that are unique, lively, and skillfully handled as Lisa Jackson does.<br /><br />The story concerns Actress jenna Hughes who decides to leave Hollywood once and for all.  She's been stalked by an overzealous fan and her sister Jill was killed on the set of her last movie.  She packs up her two daughters and moves to a remote ranch in Oregon to try and find some peace in her life.  But the peace doesn't last long.  her daughters are having trouble adjusting to the new setting and her teen is getting out of control, and then Jenna starts receiving disturbing letters which she thinks is from another obsessed fan.  Meanwhile, women are turning up dead in the nearby region and Sheriff Carter begins to unravel a plot which has deadly implications for Jenna and her daughters.<br /><br />This was a chilling and very suspenseful thriller.  As mentioned, Jackson keeps you guessing as to the identity of the killer with plenty of suspects to choose from.  The feeling of isloation for Jenna and her family is palpable, especially when a fierce winter storm moves in.  This really is an edge of the seat thriller with strong characters and a deftly developed plot.  Highly recommended!	2005-04-21

Crime books aren't my cup of tea normally but this one is so different.  Wildy humorous with lively and offbeat characters that jump to life as you read the book.  And so very humorous that it had me laughing out loud in several places.<br /><br />Joey Perrone has had more than her share of bad relationships with men.  But then she meets Chaz, a handsome biologist that sweeps her off her feet.  The pair are soon married and everything seems perfect.  Chaz tests water in the Everglades and soon finds himself being paid off by the owner of a large farm to doctor his reports and cover up the farmers pollution.  Chazz is worried that Joey has found out and when the pair take a trip aboard a cruise ship off the Florida coast, he pushes Joey overboard, confident she won't survive.<br /><br />Joey does, and is rescued by an ex-cop Mick Stranahan.  He nurses her back to health but rather than call the cops, Joey wants to find out why Chaz tried to kill her and also exact a little revenge on her husband.  Meanwhile detective Rolvaag is buying Chaz's story since Chaz is basically pulling a \\"Scott Peterson\\" and begins to investigate him.  Chaz's boss is concerned and sets a mammoth, hairy bodyguard nicknamed \\"Tool\\" to babysit Chaz.  This all sets in motion plots and subplots of blackmail and revengedthat Hiaasen neatly weaves and ties together.<br /><br />Just an enjoyable read from start to finish with wacky and offbeat characters and situations.  The fact that Joey is more concerned with just driving her husband nuts and rattling him rather than simply seeing him put in jail is hilariously put forth by Hiaasen.  This man can really write!  My first book of his and it won't be the last!	2005-04-21

JOE THRILLER IN THE ARCTIC	I hadn't read a GI Joe comic since probably the early 1990's when the series was still being published by Marvel Comics.  It was never a great favorite as I felt it never lived up to its potential.  Marvel clearly was aiming the title towards kids who played with the action figures.  Thankfully Devil's Due has taken into account the many adult fans of \\"Joe\\" with stories that are gritty and contemporary.  G.I. Joe Frontline \\"Icebound\\" is a 96 page, full-color trade paperback.  It collect issues 5 - 8 of the G.I. Joe Frontline comic.<br /><br />In 1994, Duke led a team of operatives to remote scientific research facility in the arctic region of Norway.  The scientists were working on a project coded Operation: Coldfire to genetically enhance soldiers to be resistance to temperature extremes, in this case, extreme cold.  When communications with the facility suddenly stopped, Duke and his team were sent to investigate...and Duke returned as the only survivor of the ill-fated mission.  Now, seven years later, a distress signal is coming from the same facility which Duke feels is impossible since the entrance was completely sealed.<br /><br />Against his wishes, Duke is ordered to gather a team and once again return to Norway.  His team consists of Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, Lifeline, Airtight, and Frostbite.  It's obvious to the rest of the team that Duke is very apprehensive about returning but he doesn't want to talk about it when prodded by Lifeline.  The fact that their leader is nervous only serves to make the rest of the team tense as well.  As they enter the facility and begin their search, the team comes face-to-face with the threats that wiped out Duke's team the first time.  To make matters worse, the entrance has collapsed, trapping the team inside.<br /><br />This story combined elements of noted horror films \\"The Thing\\" and \\"Resident Evil\\" to make for one of the most unique G.I. Joe stories I've ever read.  Writers Dan Jolley and Drew Johnson did a superb job of building the tension as the team begins the search of the research facility.  Much like a film, you never knew what might be lurking just around the corner or in the shadows.  The tension was palpable among the various team members, especially Duke and Lifeline.  Adding to the atmosphere was the outstanding use of color with pale blues to reflect the cold of the arctic and reds to display the dim lighting of the inside of the facility.  Color is often underrated in comics and here is a great example where color was used very effectively to convey a mood.  The colors, along with the art of pencilers Drew Johnson, Javier Pena, and Tom Feister, and inkers Ray Sneider & Juan Santacruz made this one of the most visually appealing G.I. Joe stories I've ever had the pleasure of reading.  Add to that the book includes the gorgeous covers to the original for comics by Tony Harris.<br /><br />The only minor grumble I might offer is that Snake-Eyes, long one of the fan favorites, isn't given a whole lot to do in the story and seems just along for the ride.  That very minor issue aside, this was a fantastic story and highly recommended even if you are not a Joe fan.the team begins the search of the research facility.

Sokora Refugees is a fantastically funny new graphic novel from TokyoPop combining fantasy elements and modern day humor in a refreshingly original story.  Kana Tanaka is having a very bad day.  She's late for class, hasn't studied for the big test, and her friends, the athletic and patronizing Tamara and the ever-inquisitive Julie have little sympathy for her.  Add to that she's the butt of jokes from the boys in school who call her \\"no-can\\" due to her under-developed chest and things just can't get any worse for poor Kana....Oh, but they do get worse!  A geeky new kid in school gets the desk right behind her.  Later, when Kana is showering after gym class, the new kid springs out of hiding, slamming into the naked Kana.  Suddenly both are transported to the mystical realm of Sokora and end up in a swamp, Kana wearing nothing but a towel!<br /><br />And it keeps getting better for Kana as she finds herself face-to-face with a demonic Goyle who was hunting for an Elven sorceress.  Kana is about to become Goyle food when she's rescued Tristan, an Elven Warrior and Salome a wood nymph.  Joining them is that geeky new kid who turns out to be Tristan's younger brother, Tien.  After escaping the Goyle, Tristan explains how portals to demon worlds have been popping up and their once peaceful land has been invaded.  Tien was sent to Earth for his own protection but has no desire to remain there.  He wants to use his magical abilities to help fight the demons.  It's all very Greek...or Elven to Kana who just wants to get back home.  She's sent back but now it's in the body of that same Elven sorceress, hunted by the Goyle.  What's more, this body is EXTREMELY voluptuous and Kana struggles mightily to get her shirt buttoned around her huge new assets.  Kana soon is contacted by Veila, the sorceress who tells her the two are now bonded together and she needs Kana's help.  Soon Kana, along with Tamara and Julie travel back to Sokora and find themselves attacked by demonic insects, eventually driven off by their master the Vampire Demon Kogurai who destroys the portal to our world leaving Kana and her friends trapped.<br /><br />This Manga had me laughing out loud on several occasions at poor Kana's plight.  She instantly finds herself disliked by Salome who doesn't want any other females around Tristan.  Little brother Tien is like an Elven Dennis the Menace who can work magic.  He's always getting into trouble, and getting others into trouble with his antics...like anchoring a portal in the girl's shower!  The art by Melissa DeJesus balances a humorous and cartoonish Manga style that blends well with the adventurous part of the storyline.  The story was written by Segamu who definitely had a feel for the hardships of teenage girls and the problems they face and had great fun, all at Kana's expense.  This 196 page graphic novel was the first volume in this new series and I can't wait to see what is in-store for the characters in future volumes.

Rather than trying to compete with the more mainstream publishers, Top Shelf puts out the kind of material you don't see from anyone else.  Back in the late 1980's I published a fanzine covering small press comics.  And when I say small press, I'm referring mostly to self-published comics that could be anything from eight page mini-comics done on a copy machine, to digest or even full-sized comics, 96 pages or more.  The people who put out these comics rarely made any money as they basically sold amongst themselves in a very tight-knit small press community.  No, they really did it out of love for what they were doing.  They were some tremendously talented artists and writers!<br /><br />Which brings me back to Top Shelf.  Top Shelf reminds me of that era of small press comics, and Owly is a great example.  Owly is a true triumph of the comic-strip medium.  It's a  160 page, black & white, digest-sized graphic novel that tells the story without the benefit...or need...of dialog.  The only text you see is used to convey sound effects.  It takes a talented cartoonist to pull it off and Andy Runton does, and does so masterfully.  Owly contains two stories, \\"The Way Home\\" and \\"The Bittersweet Summer.\\"<br /><br />In \\"The Way Home\\" we see a sensitive, lonely little owl, who is just looking for some companionship.  He frees a couple of fireflies from a jar they are trapped in and then finds a poor little worm, sleeping on a leaf and shivering in the cold.  Owly takes him home, and makes a nice little bed for him.  The Worm is at first terrified by what should be an enemy but soon learns that Owly just wants to help.  Through picture word balloons, \\"Wormy\\" explains how he was caught in a terrible rainstorm and separated from his parents and just wants to get back home.  Owly decides to help him find his parents and takes him on the long journey home.  Along the way they are assisted by the same fireflies Owly helped earlier.<br /><br />In \\"The Bittersweet Summer\\", Owly and Wormy are now close friends, tending their garden when something rapidly buzzes by them several times.  They soon find out it's a little hummingbird.  They make friends but cannot find anything for the little bird to eat until Owly consults one of his books and finds out that they like to ear nectar from flowers so it's off to the nursery to get one.  Soon they attract a second hummingbird and Owly names them Tiny and Angel. Together with Wormy, the four friends live in Owly's home, tending the garden and playing hide and seek.  But as fall approaches and the flowers no long bloom, will the little hummingbirds finally have to leave?<br /><br />This graphic novel is one of the most unique I've ever read.  Filled with warm-hearted fun and laughter, and gentleness that is suitable for readers of all ages.  Kids, I think, would greatly enjoy Owly as the cartoon is so evocative of many great children's books.  Andy Runton has a crisp, clean cartooning style.  It's amazing to see the emotions his characters can convey with just their facial expressions.  This is simply a fantastic graphic novel and highly recommended.eflies Owly helped earlier. <br /> <br />In \\"The Bittersweet Summer\\", Owly and Wormy are now close friends, tending their garden when something rapidly buzzes by them several times.

But when it comes to the game of Baseball, Tony LaRussa is a genius.  He's one of the great minds and thinkers the game has ever had.  he's a four-time Manager of the year.  Look at his record and you will see a guy who isn't all that much above .500 with a career .534 winning %.  But in the fickle game of baseball, LaRussa has been able to to something few managers have ever been able to do...that is to put a competitive team out on the field and do so consistently.  In his 25 year managerial career LaRussa's teams have finished in one of the top 3 spots in their division 18 times including 10 first place finishes.  That is truly astounding!<br /><br />This book is a real testament to his \\"genius\\" a man who is so thoughtful and cerebral, you wonder how he can stand to deal with so many of today's primadonna athletes.  The book focuses primarily on a three game series versus the hated rival Chicago Cubs.  Buzz Bissinger takes an analytical eye and breaks down everything LaRussa does during these games from making out his lineups to deciding on which relief pitcher to use.  LaRussa is like a Boy Scout ten-fold, virtually prepared for any situation and playing every angle he can to his advantage.<br /><br />We further hear LaRussa's insights on the major problem in baseball today...steroids, as well as the Manager's way of dealing with star athletes.  A truly fascinating book for any true fan of baseball.	2005-04-18

I have to admit, I had no idea that Archie also appeared in newspaper strips, hundreds of them, all around the world, so this book came as a great surprise to me.  Archie is one of the most enduring characters in all of comics.  Created in 1941 in the pages of MLJ's Pep Comics #22, Archie has thrived for over sixty years.  When nearly all the superhero comics disappeared in the late 40's, Archie and his ganged endured on through the prosperous 1950's, the rebellious 1960's, the eclectic 1970's, the \\"me first 1980's\\" and...what have we called the 1990's?  Oh well, you get the idea.<br /><br />Archie as a comic strip makes perfect sense.  This wonderful 96 page trade paperback collects the Archie daily strips from 1994 through 1995 as told by Craig Boldman and Harry Scarpelli.  These strips feature the familiar Archie art style that so many of us have grown up with over the decades.  If you haven't read Archie in a long time it's fun to see how Archie has changed with the times as these strips feature things like Big screen TV's and CD's.  Give it up to Archie for staying current!<br /><br />The strips in the book are 3 to 4 panel strips, each dated specifically.  Most of the strips are self-contained stories but there are some that go over several days.  Typically they are Archie \\"quickies\\" with a punch line at the end such as when Mrs. Grundy asks Archie to name three important people in \\"Western Civilization\\" and he responds with, \\"Roy Rogers, John Wayne, and Clint Eastwood.\\"<br /><br />The book also hits upon all of the most famous themes from the years of Archie comics such as the Betty, Veronica and Archie love triangle, Jughead's laziness and appetite, Moose's stupidity, and Reggie's ego.  Among the stories we see is the school year coming to an end as Mr. Weatherbee exclaims that the halls are hallowed again after the last student leaves the building.  End of school leads to summer fun including days at the beach, baseball and cookouts.  Jughead gets a job that lasts a whole two days (two days in the strip that is) and Arch and Jughead end up with jobs at an amusement park.<br /><br />In another ongoing story that runs over several days, Archie runs for class President and his horrified to learn he is running against Veronica.  He tries everything to throw the election but wins anyhow!  Just great stuff!  I'm a big comic strip fan and Archie is a strip that really works well in a three to four panel format.  If I have one minor complaint it's that there's no color strips.  Strictly black & white but that's pretty trivial.  I only wish my local papers carried it.  Highly recommended!(two days in the strip that is) and Arch and Jughead end up with jobs at an amusement park.

They create the Well of Eternity upon the world of Azeroth, leaving flights of dragons to protect their creation.  Azeroth soon becomes a battle ground as the Titans former champion, the Dark Titan Sargeras, corrupted by evil and with hordes of orcs led by the Lich King, seeks the Well for his own.  The cataclysmic battle sunders the world into fragmented landmasses.  The story begins as the Lich King, Arthas seeks to rebuild his citadel and humans and orcs enter join in an uneasy alliance to battle Arthas' undead Scourge.<br /><br />An injured blue dragon, Kalec, now in human form is assisted by a young girl Anveena to escape those who are hunting him.  Kalec explains that the dragons are seeking a great source of power and he was sent by Malygos, the Lord of the Blue Dragons, to find this power.  But he's not the only one searching for it.  An evil elf, Dar'khan, servant of the Lich King is also seeking the power which he reveals as the Sunwell, source of elven power, created out of the destruction of the Well of Eternity.  Dar'khan captures Kalec and Anveena and only the intervention of another blue dragon, Kalec's mate Tyrygosa, allows them to escape.  They soon learn that Anveena's home houses a secret...an egg which a tiny dragon hatches from.  Could this be the source of the power that everyone is searching for?

Having not been overly familiar with the Warcraft Universe, I found the history rich, colorful and detailed.  There certainly seems to be some Tolkien influence, particularly in the prologue, but it still cuts a nice, unique world, all its own.

Superman was one, Batman, of course.  But Captain America didn't, neither did The Flash or Green Lantern.  But another who did was America's favorite teenager, Archie Andrews.  In the years following the end of WWII, superheroes fell out of favor with comic book fans but Archie and his friends kept chugging right along, now over sixty years old!<br /><br />This great new collection from Archie Comics re-prints fifteen classic stories from the 1940's.  With an introduction written by Stephen King, himself a long-time Archie fan, we get classic Archie tales from the earliest years.  It is so interesting to see how the comic has changed, and adapted over the decades from hair and clothing styles, to music and popular culture.  I couldn't help but chuckle when Tyrone Power is mentioned in one of these early stories as being one of the girl's idols, talk about your changing times!  For those like me who grew up in the 60's and 70's, it is quite a treat to see how different the characters appeared in those early days.  That famous Archie \\"house style\\" had not been developed yet and they had a more unique look than they do today.  Among the treats that are included in this volume are:<br /><br />The very first Archie story from Pep Comics #22 in December 1941.  Archie, Betty and Jughead are all introduced.  In particular, Archie and Betty look more like 12-year olds than the teens we all know and love.  Archie's jalopy, which would be the source of running jokes for years, makes its first broken-down appearance just a few issues later in Pep Comics #25, followed by Riverdale's favorite debutante Veronica in Pep #26, both in 1942.<br /><br />Archie's nemesis Reggie mantle makes his first full appearance in Jackpot Comics # 6 in the Summer of 1942, and already the rivalry over Veronica would begin.  Veronica's dad, Mr. Lodge comes along in Pep #31.<br /><br />\\"Prom Pranks\\" from Archie Comics #1, 1942, relates the tale of how Veronica first met Archie and decided to go to Riverdale high.  Ahhh...bet you though Ronny always went to Riverdale just like I did!<br /><br />\\"Double Date\\" from Archie #7 gives us the first of what would be the decisive storyline in Archie comics...the love triangle between Archie, Betty, and Veronica as Arch is caught having a date with both at the same time.<br /><br />In \\"Battle of the Jitterbugs\\" from Archie #30, Archie and Reggie challenge Betty and Veronica to a Jitterbug dance contest to prove that boys are better dancers.  Each of the boys takes turns dressing up in drag for the big contest.<br /><br />\\"Dangerous Sex\\" from 1949 introduces us to \\"Moose\\" as Jughead has to reluctantly tutor Moose's girl Lottie Little for a big test.<br /><br />Wow!  What a collection!  When you read these stories it's not hard to see why this character has survived over 60 years.  This is just good, old fashioned comic fun that is sorely lacking in comics of today...except for Archie Comics, of course!  Highest recommendation!onica's dad, Mr. Lodge comes along in Pep #31. <br /> <br />\\"Prom Pranks\\" from Archie Comics #1, 1942, relates the tale of how Veronica first met Archie and decided to go to Riverdale high.

This of course adapts the final part to Lucas's prequel Star Wars trilogy as the Clone War comes to an end and we see how Anakin Skywalker is seduced over to the Dark Side of the Force.  The artwork of Doug Wheatley really made this work for me.  Vibrant and yet subtle.  The depth of shading and lighting was among the best I've ever seen and fits a sci-fi setting so very well.  I mean just check out the rays of sunlight that filter down from above.  It's just breathtaking!  Wheatley did a magnificent job of capturing the essence of all the characters.<br /><br />If you really, really can't wait until the movie comes out then I definitely suggest you pick up this book.  It's why I didn't give any spoilers away because I simply could not wait but didn't want to spoil it for others.  Highly recommended!	2005-04-12

The public has an infatuation with them much like with the Mafia.<br /><br />Bill Queen is nuts...has to be to do what he did and live amongst these people for over two years, doing drugs and commiting crimes just to prove his worth to the gang.  And he didn't just risk his life then, but even now he is a target for those he helped bring to justice.  It is most interesting how Queen notes that these men are so much like the Mafia in that there is true love and friendship among the members, and yet they wouldn't hesitate to kill their own if they stepped out of line.  It's a kind of almost hive relationship that most people just cannot fathom.<br /><br />Wow, what an incredibly riveting tale.  Bill Queen certainly gives new meaning to the word guts.	2005-04-12

But Hansen created another character, equally as manic and decidedly more violent...the monster slaying Doctor Gorpon.  Originally appearing in Eternity Comics in the early 1990's, NOW comics has collected these adventures into a 96 page trade paperback.<br /><br />Doctor Gorpon is...unusual to say the least.  He's about 90% upper-torso with skinny arms and legs, but don't let the look fool you.  The Doctor isn't the smartest monster slayer ever, but he's efficient...Gorpon slays monsters by ripping their heads clean off, as he does in the opening pages of the first story.  Poor Mrs. Merdo never knew her husband was a monster!  After his faithful sidekick destroys the Doc's wheels, he's smashed over the head with a hammer and fired unceremoniously, vowing revenge.  Meanwhile the Police Chief wants nothing more than to bring Gorpon in as he considers him a menace.  When two metal-head stoners conjure a demon, eating poor Elrod, Gorpon has to save the day.  Doofus, the other metal-head, offers himself as Gorpon's new sidekick.<br /><br />In the second story, Doc's deposed sidekick has vowed revenge by hiring a hit man to take Doc out.  Meanwhile a mad scientist has invented a formula which brings a chocolate bunny to life that devours every \\"hooman\\" in sight as revenge for years of chocolate bunnies being eaten.<br /><br />In the last story, Doc takes on Doofus as his new sidekick, even while his old sidekick and the hit man are invading his secret hideout.  Doc has a final showdown with the police chief, meanwhile an evil, primordial pond of ooze comes to life intent on killing Doctor Gorpon.  Will this be the last adventure of the Doctor?  Pick this trade paperback up and see for yourself.<br /><br />Hilariously violent and chaotic, the adventures of Doctor Gorpon are a wonderful trip back to that period of the late 80's and early 90's when so many small press comic companies were putting out great material without feeling the need to have big-breasted and scantily clad women as the selling point.  Marc Hansen's unique art style reminds me of those old \\"Weird Ohs\\" trading cards from the 1960's (I'm dating my self now) mixed with a bit of Don Martin of MAD magazine influence.  His style is perfectly suited for a book like this and he's certainly one of the most talented cartoonists in comics.

It was done at a time when expansion had not yet watered down the talent of the league and free agency had yet to tear teams apart.  The 35 - 5 start by the Tigers that year was one of the greatest accomplishments by a team in any sport.  An .875 winning percentage through 40 games!  The highlight would be Jack Morris' no-hitter against the White Sox and would just grow from there as the Tigers led the AL East from start to finish, then swept the Royals and blased the Padres in five games to win the world series.<br /><br />It was a team that had it all with great starting pitching from Morris, Dan Petry, and Milt Wilcox.  Great relivers with Aurelio Lopez and the 1984 Cy Young and MVP Willie Hernandez.  They hit with power and average with the likes of Kirk Gibson, Lance Parrish, and Darrel Evans and hit for average with Lou Whitaker, Alan Trammell and Chet Lemon.  They had great defense as well.<br /><br />\\"Bless you Boys\\" became the rallying cry for fans that year thanks to former sportscaster Al Ackerman.  He even got then President Ronald Regan to say it.  What a season..the battles with Toronto were legendary.  And of course there was game five of the World Series and Gibson's epic three-run homer off ace reliever Goose Gossage to cement the series win.  What a season!	2005-04-12

Count Dooku (The Chris Lee Character from the film) sends a message to his former master, Yoda, claiming that he wants to talk peace.  While it's most certianly a trap, Yoda still holds out hope that a peace can bring an end to the Clone Wars.<br /><br />They travel to the dark worlf of Vjun with several Jedi, al of which are new characters created for this novel.  Stewart did a great job bringing the four Jedi to life, infusing each with their own unique personalities and motivations.  Meanwhile, the group is being stalked by Dooku's own apprentice the Asaaj Ventress, who was introduced in the Clone Wars cartoon.<br /><br />One of the great things Stewart does is exploring the relationship between Yoda and Dooku through flashbacks.  It's a complex and well-thought out teacher-student relationship.  We get a powerful scene where Yoda himself is nearly swayed to the Dark Side by Dooku.<br /><br />Stewart really has a great grasp of the Star Wars characters, particularly those of the prequel and fleshes them out so much more than we've seen in the films.  Great job!	2005-04-12

My co-worker's wife is a first grade teacher and knowing I have a young one, she recommended this book to me.  She said it was a big hit among her students and I can certainly see why.  Ok, crude as it may be, kids find farting to be very funny.  Heck, a lot of adults do to.  The story concerns two kids, Betty and Billy, who pick Walter out at the dog pound because no one else wanted him. Their mother tells them to give him a bath because he smells, but they soon find out that won't work...because Walter has a little gas problem.<br /><br />Little is being kind...Walter even farts in his sleep!  The vet recommends changing his diet, but to no avail.  Walter keeps letting loose.  The kids parents want Walter to go back to the pound and the children are heart-broken.  But like in all good \\"under dog\\" stories, Walter comes through in the clutch and wins over mom & dad.  Wonderful story.  Very funny for kids and adults and with brilliant illustrations by Audry Coleman that bring the story to life with its zany, cartoony style.  Great book!	2005-04-11

Prince Roger and his company of marines have been marooned on the planet of Marduk in a constant battle for life and death through the first three books.  Roger has slowly turned from the care-free, \\"playboy Prince\\" into a battle-hardened and respected leader of Bravo company with just a dozen surviving members.  Upon learning that his mother the Empress has fallen victim to a coup and is now being controlled as a puppet ruler, Roger and the remaining survivors, along with a number of loyal Mardukans, hatch a plot to get themselves smuggled off Marduk and back to new Earth to rescue the Empress.<br /><br />Nice shift in locale after the first three books.  A mix of action, intrigue and political diplomacy.  Roger has to walk a fine line with trying to find allies as he finds himself as the one accused of murder and plotting against the Empress.  Fast-paced and moves right along well.  I like the development in Roger's character in this latest book.  Fun read!	2005-04-08

But not before TV's spunkiest cook can put her stamp on low carb as Rachael Ray does in her latest book.  At 256 pages this is Rachael's largest book yet.  I've never quite been able to get meals done in 30 minutes.  i guess it probably helps having good editors and a staff but even at 45 minutes or so I've enjoyed every one of Rachael's books.  It's good food where taste is first, not fancy presntation and ingredients that have you haunting exotic food stores to find.<br /><br />The recipes here are not all that low-carb so don't be put off by thinking it's a diet cook book.  It's just another great one from Rachael where carbs are used in moderation, but not at the sacrifice of taste.  Call them good-sense carb recipes as opposed to low-carb.  There's plenty of bread and pasta to be found inside.  With all her books the emphasis is on good food and good food done fast and this one, like the previous ones, is right on the mark.  Wonderful Italian and Mexican dishes, burgers, even desserts.  And it all comes to you in Rachael's endearing, homey way of writing that comes across so well on TV.  With her new publisher now being a part of Random House, the book is much more well-presented than her previous ones.  Bolder colors that stand out and just plain look better.<br /><br />Another winner from Rachael!	2005-04-07

With books like these, people are finally able to see just how talented some comic-book writers are and also we are seeing that comics need not be limited to guys in capes and women with bulging breasts.  These books are such a breath of fresh air to long-time comic fans like myself.<br /><br />In this one a two-bit sleaze photographer named Dwight is re-united with an old flame named Ava.  Ava is on the run from her wealthy husband.  But not is all as it seems and we soon learn that Dwight is being played for a grade \\"A\\" patsy and he's the one that will soon need help.  Boy this really screams of the great, gritty crime classics of the 1940's, but updated with modern, in your face violence of today's films.  Over the top?  Maybe, but a darn fine ride still.  Throught it all we Miller's sylish, shaded artwork that lends itself perfectly to this type of story.  Brilliant!	2005-04-07

I'll admit to being a huge skeptic on the subject of ghosts but I'll watch antyhing on hauntings and love to read about them as well. Author Troy Taylor is the real thing---an honest to goodness ghost hunter!  Whether you're so serious that you want to do this as a business or just for the fun and thrills of it, you'll find this fieldbook immensely useful.<br /><br />Troy explains  the various types of equipment that is used for ghost hunting including what the equipment is used for and how.  he also provides details on investigating the history of whatever you may be researching, types of hauntings, and also provides a nice history of the field of paranormal research.  Is it authoritative?  Well really who can say?  I'm sure mr. Taylors methods may differ from other ghost hunters.  But even if you're not planning to go out and explore the local haunted house in your home town, this is still quite a fascinating book to read.	2005-04-07

So much of fiction that is called \\"teen fiction\\" today is way off the mark.  I don't know what teens they are writing the books for but they sure don't seem to be writing for the teens I know and I say this as a father of a teen.  Much of it seems to cozy, to perfect, or elses it's 180 degress the other way with it being too morose and depressing.  Shadowland, the first book in the Mediator Series seems to get it just about right, striking that perfect balance that is the utter chaos of the minds of many teens.<br /><br />The mediator in question is Suze Simon.  Mediator means she is able to communicate with the spirits of the dead and is able to help them move on to their final resting place.  Quite a responsibility for a young girl.  She moves from NY to California along with mother, and new step-father and three step-brothers which is certainly stressful enough without her seeing spirits.  One such is Jesse, a \\"hot\\" ghost that lives in her new room.  She is then confronted by the spirit of Heather, a (very) angry spirit who committed suicided when her boyfriend dumped her.  Turns out this same boyfriend has the hots for Suze and asks her out, REALLY ticking off Heather.<br /><br />The book seems to be a bit influeneced By Buffy the Vampire Slayer with it's characters and sly wit, and that's not a bad thing.  I found myself enjoying Suze's plight and her reactions to the various spirits she encounters.  Excellent first book in the series.	2005-04-07

More than likely he will attend a local college but this was a great way to look at the many local colleges without spending several days driving around.  Of course, colleges like prospective students to visit the campus of course which is fine once you've narrowed your choices, but until then, get started with this fine book.  Well over 300 colleges reviewed from the large to the small with full page or more reviews of each one.  You get all the much needed information on major programs, financial assistance, tuition, activities, campus lifestyle, and so much more.  Among the most valuable features is interviews with students and professors.  These were quite interesting to read.  Very good ratings system.  It may have been a bit early but I doubt much will change in a few years and we'll probably just buy the 2009 guide when it comes out anyway.  There's no such thing as being too early.

It's always interesting to read real-life accounts of people who've had encounters with spirits.  Real, everyday people, not some celebrity has-been on some half-baked mediums show, trying to shill a book or something.  And although the various shows that pop up on the History Channel and Travel Channel, there's still something not quite as scary when actors are used to re-create an encounter.  That's why this book is so satisfying and so downright chilling to read.  The encounters are from just everyday people like you and me.  Some are rather humorous and some downright unsettlingly scary.<br /><br />Author Mark Alan Morris pens these stories like a master craftsmen.  You'll not only find traditional haunted house hauntings but hauntings in Inns, battlefields, and in cemetary's as well.  I'm not bother by some reviewers complaints that the author didn't try to authenticate these stories.  I don't think that was what the book is about.  These people seem to be speaking form their hearts and directly to the readers.  Morris adds a postscript to the stories that wraps them up fairly neatly.  This is a great one for reading on those dark and stormy nights or telling a few tales around Halloween.  Great stuff!	2005-04-07

His standup shows on Comedy Channel and HBO have been brilliant. The book is much like reading his stand-up act as he gives you that scouring, aggitated view point on so many different subjects.  What I like about Black is that you can't qualify him politically.  He goes after the Right, the Left, and the In-between with full vim and vigor.  And religion is certainly not spared either. Black even gives you takes on his one family showing there there truly is \\"nothing sacred'.  There's plenty of his rants to go around.<br /><br />I found myself laughing at loud in several spots in this book.  It's short but it's a blast.  Cleverly written and dead on target on so many things.  I see Black as the heir to be to George Carlin's throne as the top stand-up.	2005-04-06

From the talented pen...and brush of cartoonist Jef Czekaj, comes this madcap and thoroughly delightful book collecting the adventures of Grampa & Julie: Shark Hunters!  Most of these stories originally appeared in the pages of Nickelodeon Magazine from 1999 to 2003 but the material has been redrawn and edited and new material added to frame the duo's zany adventures.<br /><br />It's Julie's turn to get up in front of her class to give her report on what she did on her Summer vacation.  She slowly, and with great effort, tries to drag her backpack to the podium, before using a wheelbarrow for assistance. Julie opens the backpack and reveals a massive tome.  We are suddenly whisked off to the Atlantic Ocean where Julie and her Grampa are in search of Stephen, the world's largest shark.  Julie is one determined young girl and Grampa is a child-like goof-off in a folded paper hat.  Along the way they meet a cast of characters that gives new definition to the word `screwball'.<br /><br />A squirrel and a duck on their way to a rapping competition, ocean monkeys who live in a secret cave and need help opening a jar of peanut butter, modern day pirates, and a pair of cats who want to find Stephen to make cat food out of him...and that's just in the first half of this hilarious book.  Their adventures take them from the depths of the ocean to outer space in Gramma's rocket (every Gramma has a rocket, don't you know?) as they blast off to Purple Planet to encounter the fearsome Scientist Monster and to Planet Fiesta where Stephen is celebrating his birthday and wants his \\"mommy\\".  The journey nears its end at the North Pole as they encounter The Snow Queen, Abominable Snowmen, and a giant whale who eats Gramma's helicopter with Gramma still in it!<br /><br />A little girl's vivid imagination or did all that really happen?  Who cares!  This is one wild and rollicking ride!  Jef Czekaj has a unique cartooning style that is fresh and as good as anything you'll see in your Sunday funnies.  This 128 page, full-color book from is like watching an animated adventure as the panels and the action flow so well.  I'm a big comic strip fan and this one truly took me by surprise.

Archie Comics proved it, too, could generate national publicity with their own major storyline.  Namely, after over 50 years of a love triangle battle, Archie was finally going to choose between Betty and Veronica!  You can imagine how much interest this generated among long-time fans.  Often overlooked is the fact that Archie and the gang had been among the longest running comic book series in history with legions of fans, young an old.  Could it be that the love triangle that started before WWII would finally be resolved?  The tale would play out over the course of four issues in 1994: Archie #429, Betty #19, Betty & Veronica #82, and Veronica #39, and they are all collected in this one historic volume.  As noted in the introduction, fans were clamoring for months, begging for hints as to who would finally win Archie's affection.<br /><br />The tale begins as Archie is seeing hearts over a love letter he received.  Betty and Veronica demand to know who sent Archie the letter but Archie is having so much fun seeing them squabble he decides to make them wait.  Betty and Veronica each think the other sent the note and so begins a no-holds-barred battle for Archie as we've never seen before.  The under-handed tricks fly fast and furious!  Veronica fools Betty with some tickets to a charity dance with the wrong date.  Veronica ends up at the dance with Archie while Betty is fixing his car!  Betty crashes the party in style wearing one of the skimpiest dresses ever seen in an Archie comic.  Veronica fights back in her own \\"dress to kill\\" style, eventually leading two a duel of super soakers between the two long time rivals.  But in the end, Archie has a big surprise for both of them.<br /><br />This was just a fun story from beginning to end.  Betty and Veronica are at their most \\"catty\\" with claws fully extended as they go after each other like never before.  And one cannot but laugh as Archie sits back, watching the pair fight over him, knowing he has a huge ace up his sleeve.  Absolutely hilarious!  Reggie, of course, makes an appearance and stirs up as much trouble as he can and Jughead makes a brief cameo as well.  Archie Comics proves that in 1994, and now in 2005, that they can still delight their fans, young and old.  The great thing is that even if you have not picked up an Archie comic in decades, you can still read this story as it is truly a stand-alone classic for the ages.

Long a fan of egyptology, I love the background of the archaelogical digs of the 1920's and that grand time of Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon's discovery of King Tuts tomb.<br /><br />Amelia and her Egyptologist husband, Emerson, are excavating in the Valley of the Kings when Magda Petheric, the widow of a noted collector, brings Emerson a golden artifact in the likeness of a forgotten Egyptian king, that she says is cursed.  She wants Emerson and Amelia to dispose of the item.  Magda soon turns up dead and Emerson is determined to figure out her murder as well as taking care of Magda's wish about the artifact.  But now word of the statue has gotten out and there are others with designs on the treasure, including Emerson's mysterious brother Sethos.<br /><br />Lively chracters and a real sense of 1920's adventure and mystery really fill this book.  It's like watching one of those great 1930's or 40's mysteries set against the exotic Egyptian background that really captured the nation's imagination back in the 1920's with the discovery of tut's tomb.  Really enjoyable.  I may have to check out the other books in this series now!	2005-04-04

Where I once had a collection of some 12,000 comics, I now have less than 200.  I've sold off most of it but one thing I do still collect is comics that have a Christmas theme, particularly those that are pre-1970.  That's why this collection of classic Archie Christmas stories came as such a treat to me.  In this volume you get 14 wonderful tales from the pages of \\"Archies Christmas Stocking\\" between the years of 1956 and 1963.  These are hilarious and even heart-warming tales filled with the kind of holiday cheer you just don't see in comic books anymore.<br /><br />This classic volume includes:<br /><br />\\"Christmas Socking\\"  Veronica and Betty conspire to get Archie and Reg to kiss Moose's girl Midge under the mistletoe since Moose won't do it.  But the boys and Midge start enjoying it a little too much!<br /><br />\\"Idiots Delight\\" Betty wants to spend time with Archie but he's busy with Veronica.  Then she hits on the perfect scheme...play the dumb blonde so well that Archie has no choice but to help Betty with everything including wrapping presents and trimming the tree.<br /><br />\\"Ring that Belle\\"  Veronica mistakenly believes that Archie is giving her and engagement ring for Christmas.  When Archies friends find out, he finds himself repeatedly returning her gift for something else.  Will it be the right gift?<br /><br />\\"Seasonal Smooch\\" Reg tells Moose he has to let him kiss Midge under the mistletoe or Santa won't bring Moose any presents.  But that dirty Reg uses everything but mistletoe to get his lips on Midge including hedge leaves, parsley, and carrot leaves.<br /><br />\\"Those Christmas Blues\\"  Archie tells his parents he's too busy to help them decorate the tree.  His saddened parents reminisce about Archie as a little boy and how he loved to help.  But Archie has a big surprise for his parents.<br /><br />\\"A Job for Jingles\\"  Archie is visited by a precocious little elf named Jingles.  Archie introduces the elf to the rest of the gang and Jangles has the time of his life.<br /><br />\\"The Return of Jingles\\"  Jingles returns to Riverdale to see the gang again but this time he's not alone.  He bragged so much about what a great time he had that two other elves, Jangles and Jeeves, follow him to Riverdale resulting in a big fight between the trio until the big man in the red suit steps in.<br /><br />As mentioned, there are 14 stories in all and they are just a joy to read.  All the gang is here including Reg, Jughead, Mr. Weatherbee, and Mr. Lodge.  Filled with the typical Archie brand of humor and that classic Archie Comic's art-style, this will be a book that you'll want to read every holiday season.

I don't read a lot of thrillers but I really like those that are tense, fast-paced with clever plots that keep the book moving along well.  Like a good movie does and this one certainly fits into that class.  I was drawn into this story from the first chapter and it never let me go with its fascination and well-modeled characters and intricate plot.  Add to that the exotic settings and twists taken right out of our everyday headlines and this makes for one fantastic book.<br /><br />This is another Gabriel Allon thriller.  Allon is an Israeli secret agent, posing as an art restorer in Venice when he is contacted by his mentor Ari Shamron, former head of The Israeli secret service.  Terrorists have bombed and destroyed the Israeli embassy in rome and Shamron wants Allon to track down the terrorists.  Further attacks are sure to follow and Allon assembles a team of younger agents to assist him to capture the terrorist mastermind, Khaled, who just happens to be the adopted son of Yassir Arafat, and who seeks vengeance on the enemies of Palestine.  Thus begins a tense and exciting game of cat and mouse as Allon and his team track down Khaled before he can cause further death and destruction.<br /><br />The book is not only a wonderful thriller but also quite a lesson in history about israel and Palestine as well.  Daniel Silva deftly handles all the plot twists and sub-plots and gives us a cast of intelligent and lively characters.  This was my first book I've read by Mr. Silva but it sure won't be the last.

I enjoyed his work quite a bit, especiall the \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" but I was never ready to confer God status on him like many.  That said, Sin City is one of the most unique worlds ever created in comics.  Starkly real and intimidating and yet over-the-top in nearly every facet,  It's a winning combination to be sure.  Miller's use of shading and his art style are perfectly suited to this film noir type of material.  You can almost see the shadow of a slow moving fan in the background.<br /><br />The Hard Goodbye Introduces us to Basin City AKA Sin City and Marv, a lug of a guy whose just met the girl of his dreams....but not for long.  He awakes to find her dead and himself as the suspect.  Marv finds himself now battling dirty cops and whomever else dares get in his way in a true symphony of violence.  As gritty, dirty and evocative a comic story as you will ever read.  The Hard Goodbye makes \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" look like a Sesame Street story by comparison.  Wow!	2005-04-04

A new superhero hit the newsstands in January,1940.  A hero that would wear a costume featuring the red, white, and blue of old glory.  A patriotic superhero who defended America from its enemies...Nope, if you guessed Captain America you were wrong.  It was The Shield, who would make his debut a full year before Captain America, in the pages of Pep Comics #1 from MLJ.  This trade paperback, billed as America's First Patriotic Comic Book Hero, collects eight classic stories from the Golden Age of comics.<br /><br />While the Shield certainly influenced the creation of Captain America, The Shield was influenced no doubt by Superman.  With the creation of a special chemical formula and a suit that allowed him to absorb those chemicals, the Shield had enormous powers, allowing him to withstand temperatures of 2000 degrees, bend steel walls, leap great distances and travel as swiftly as a bullet.  In his secret identity, he was Joe Higgins, a G-Man working directly for J. Edgar Hoover.  This volume collects the Shield stories from Pep Comics #1 - 5, and the three stories from Shield-Wizard #1.<br /><br />In the opening story, the Shield is sent on a mission by Hoover to break up a \\"Stokian\\" spy ring operating in the U.S. and creating great havoc.  In those days the villains were fictional such as the \\"Stokians\\" or the \\"Mosconians\\" but it isn't too hard to tell who they are supposed to be.  In the second story, American oil tankers are disappearing near Puerto Rico and The Shield is sent to investigate.  He finds the \\"Nordics\\" are pirating the ships of their precious oil and the Shield metes out some serious justice.<br /><br />From Pep Comics #3 comes a tale with a very futuristic slant as mysterious enemy planes are dropping mines into the N.Y. Harbor.  The enemy planes are too fast to be caught by our planes and the Shield takes on the case.  He finds the planes can transform from aircraft to watercraft and follows them to a great, undersea lair.<br /><br />Story four is a two-part epic.  In a tale that pre-dates the attack on Pearl Harbor by over a year, the Shield travels to Pearl to foil a plan of the Mosconians to cause a volcanic eruption that will wipe out the island.  The story concludes in Pep Comics #5 as the Shield tracks the Mosconians back to their Washington D.C. hideout for the climactic battle.  The final three stories are actually prequels to the above as we see the Shield's origin told in detail for the first time and we follow him on his first few cases as a G-Man as he battles saboteurs and a crime syndicate.<br /><br />Also included on the back cover is reprint from Pep Comics #66 from 1948, where the Shield says his goodbye to the members of his fan club as he turns the club over to Archie Andrews.  By the late 1940's, superhero titles had fallen out of fashion with kids and the Shield was no different.  But like so many Golden Age heroes he would be re-born in the Silver Age, but that's a story for another time.<br /><br />The Shield was created by writer Harry Shorten and artist Irv Novick, one of the greats of the Golden Age.  These stories bring back such a sense of wonder and awe that is lacking in many superhero books today.  Novick's style was simple, but clean and very representative of the era.  The Shield's stories were eerily prophetic, especially those stories about Pearl Harbor, written well before December 7, 1941.<br /><br />So many classic Golden Age heroes have been lost over the decades and faded to obscurity.  What a credit it is to the people at Archie Comics to put these classic stories into a great collection like this and to preserve such an important piece of Americana.ory four is a two-part epic.

At once a skewering and and education about religion and politics.  As a conservative, I cannot tell you how much it annoys me to be lumped into the pile of of southern moral majority, bible thumping types JUST because I am conservative.  Since when are all Christians red-necked book burners???  I'm Catholic which makes me a Christian.  I am vehemently opposed to any sort of censorship in schools but i have no problem with the Ten Commandments being printed on a stinking rock outside of a courthouse.  One greatly affects me...the other is...just a rock!  Wallis goes after the Catholic Church and their cover up of sexual abuse and also after the wealthy TV evangelists and their lavish lifestyles.<br /><br />Wallis deftly points out the flaws in this ridiculous assumption.  This became such a focal point for the 2004 election that REAL issues were forgotten about by both sides.  The left so dismissed the importance of religion that it ultimately led to strong alliances that bolstered Bush.  Meanwhile the Right's \\"Right\\" stance on everything brought out the type of activist protests that we have not seen in this country since the height of the Vietnam war.<br /><br />Wallis does make his stand agains the War in Iraq and the Middle East in general which while I disagree with his belief that the war was wrong, at least he frames an intelligent argument as opposed to being against it only because he's anti-Republican.  Wallis further covers the religious and moral stance to the world's great problems of terrorism, poverty, abortion, and capital punishment.  Wallis cleverly points out the hypocritical views of both the right and left when dealing with these issues and the remarkable inconsistencies in their beliefs.<br /><br />This is clear-headed thinking...something that is in short supply in today's black and white society.  Well done!	2005-03-31

I've heard Rosemary Haley's cleaning tips for years on the radio as she was a frequent guest on a local afternoon talk show.  Her tips helped my wife and I out of more than one bind in the past.  This book is a must have if you have children.  You know that however much you might expect everything, that somehow your little ones will find a way to make a brand new mess that has to be cleaned whether it's crayon on your new tile floor or refrigerator or fruit snacks smashed into your carpet.  The Haley's remind that preventing the mess from happening is the best way to stop a mess in the first place.  Well that's common sense but as we all know, not always practical.<br /><br />Their book is sectioned by cleaning kitchens, bathrooms, floors and carpets, furniture, walls, laundry, even outside the home.  While the book didn't suggest a message for those fruit snacks, the method for cleaning gum from carpets worked just as well.  Food stains, pet stains, paint, and yes...they even cover getting out crayon marks!  What a relief!  If it can be cleaned, you will find a way to clean it in this very comprehensive book.<br /><br />Besides these direct cleaning tips the book also provides advice on buying cleaning items, tools, and having kids actually ENJOY helping out.

The amazing thing about these two as well as many of the runners who compete in the badwater is that they are not young by any means.  I think this is a real inspiration to those of us in our 40's who think that athletics is for the young.  if any thing, I think the maturity of Dean and the others is one of their greatest strenghts in running these ultra-marathons.  It not only takes enourmous athletic ability, but also incredible discipline to pace yourself and an unbelievable tolerance for pain.<br /><br />Dean's stories of stopping at the 7-11 store or ordering a pizza while running are hilarious and I did not find him to be sexist in anyway, especially since he was defeated by a woman twice in the badwater run.  This is a truly inspiring story not only for athletes, but for people in general as Dean clearly displays that running these races is not all about body it's just as much, if not more, about having a strong mind and will.  Something that people can apply in their everyday life.<br /><br />This really was one of the most inspirational and fulfilling books I've read in quite some time.	2005-03-29

Wizards of the Coast is best known as the  makers of the enormously popular \\"Magic: The Gathering\\" collectible card game and the \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\" role-playing game.  In 2004 Wizards moved into the realm of juvenile and teen fiction with the announcement of their Mirrorstone imprint. For the first two series under the Mirrorstone banner, they decided to stick with two subjects that they know very well: Dragonlance and Dungeons & Dragons.<br /><br />The Knights of the Silver Dragon series is aimed at readers 8 - 12 years in age. They relate the exploits of three young heroes in the town of Curston. Kellach, is the teenaged apprentice to the town's most powerful wizard, Zendric. Kellach's brother, Driskoll, is an adventurous 12 year old who dreams of becoming a great warrior like his father Torin, and they are joined by their friend Moyra, a young female thief and daughter to one of Curston's most well known thieves, Breddo.<br /><br />The town of Curston has been plagued by a series of thefts and vandalism and is growing restless as The Watchers, the town's guard, seems unable to solve the crimes.  Soon after a major fire threatens to burn down several buildings, Torin, captain of the watch, is accused of assaulting the town's new cleric as well as setting the fire.  Knowing their father would never do anything like that, the trio of comrades begins investigating the crimes and find strange symbols at each scene.<br /><br />After researching the symbol at Zendric's tower, they find out about a mysterious being called The Trickster, a shape-shifting creature who caused a great deal of trouble in the city many years before being driven out by a wizard.  But how will they find a creature who can take the shape of anyone, including themselves?  The answer lies within the fearsome Dungeons of Doom, the monster haunted ruins outside the town.  Once again the young Knights of the Silver Dragon must enter those dark passageways to find a gem which can reveal the Trickster's true appearance.<br /><br />This third book combines the best elements of the first two books of the series.  It has the dungeon crawling adventure of the first, and the riddle-solving of the second making for one exciting and dangerous adventure.  We continue to see each of these young Knights grow in power and courage.  Although each book has been written by a different person, the continuity has been well maintained and the characters have remained true.  Emily Fiegenshuh again provides a beautiful cover as well as interior illustrations that have a subtle Japanese Anime influence to them.<br /><br />Each book in the series is 180 pages with chapters that average 6 - 10 pages in length which is perfect for kids in the target age group.  This is very important as it's much more fulfilling to put a book down for the night at the end of a chapter rather than in the middle. Short chapters make it more motivating to read, especially for younger children.<br /><br />Kids love fantasy so it's no surprise that so many of the top-selling juvenile and teen books today are fantasy-oriented. They provide a sense of wonder, imagination and adventure.  This is another outstanding entry into a series which so far has gotten better and better with each title!

Books	5	2	3	N	N	DOWNRIGHT FUNNY CHILDREN'S BOOK	The best children's books are the ones that make them smile and laugh.  As parents were sometimes so consumed with having everything be educational for young children that we forget to stimulate their funny bones.  \\"Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus\\" is just the book to put a big smile on your kid's face and a big laugh in their belly.  With a simple yet silly cartooning style this is a book my 2 1/2 year old loves to look at over and over.<br /><br />The premise is simple...a bus driver has to take a short break and tells the passengers not to let the pigeon drive the bus.  That would seem common sense until the pigeon actually ASKS to drive.  he asks nicely at first, and then does his best to try and convince him and even fool them into letting him drive.  Finally he throws a tantrum and demands to drive.  Read with emphasizing the pigeons emotions really makes kids crack up.  This is delightfully funny and one of the best books for pre-schoolers.	2005-03-15

She combines witty and silly rhymes along with her trademark humorous cartooning style to make classic after classic.  The best childrens's books for pre-schoolers are those that make them laugh.  It's not all about trying to educate them all the time and Sandra's books always put a smile on my 2 1/2 year old's face.<br /><br />This time a silly Hippopotamus is not having any fun at all.  All the other animals are off playing and doing fun things and as each of them goes off to do their thing we read...\\"But not he Hippopotamus!\\"  The poor guy is feeling left out until the rest of the animals eventually invite him to join in.  And then he's happy but there's a surprising and funny twist at the end of the story.  Really a fun story.  As usual it's a nice, sturdy board book that will stand up to a lot of abuse.  Highly recommended.	2005-03-15

Fortunately they are 10 years apart in age so I won't have them attending college at the same time.  The second is saving for retirement.  I'm still 25 years or so away from retirement but I see how my own parents have struggled as they got into their mid-70's.  My dad did not have a retirement account and my mom only got into one maybe 10 years before retiring.  A sobering prospect.<br /><br />This book is a real eye-opener.  We don't plan on re-locating and we are only looking to maintain our current lifestyle while trying to account for medical expenses.  While much of the book does focus on the best places to retire with appropriate ratings, I found most helpful the various surveys and worksheets designed to come up with the retirement plan that best fits your desires.  You'll uses these work sheets to figure out just how much money you'll need to have when you retire based upon your lifestyle.<br /><br />Most interesting was information on a \\"working\\" retirement, where you enjoy the benefits of retirment while perhaps owning a small business.  There are lots of opportunities that you may not have considered for a working retirement.  There are also the very important sections dealing with healthcare, living wills, and dealing with aging parents.  This is great information for us as we are now dealing with two aging and ill parents ourselves.<br /><br />Whether your planning that retirement to Arizona or Florida, or planning on staying where ever you are at, the information in this book is invaluable.  Best of all it's great no matter what age you are whether a younger person in their late 20's or in their 40's like me.  It's never too late to get planning.	2005-03-14

As a parent of a kid who is just five years away from starting college I found the information very valuable.  It seems that investigating student loans and financial assistance is going to be every bit as an important decision as which college to attend.<br /><br />The best advice books come down to common sense.  Things and methods that are often so obvious that they are overlooked.  Despite what it says there are some quick-fixes but those quick-fixes don't have to be only short-term fixes.  This book is not all about paying your bills and saving for the future.  The Warrens know how very important it is to have \\"fun money\\" to use for entertainment and their guide helps you plan not only for savings, but also to have that money to go out to eat, or buy DVD's, etc.  In it's simplest form \\"All Your Worth\\" is about categorizing things into things that are \\"must haves\\" like your bills, and things that you \\"Want\\" say for fun.<br /><br />This book isn't one of those that you need to make a lot of money in order to be useful.  This book is about taking your current financial situation and turning it around to your advantage and escaping your debts...ESPECIALLY credit card debts.  This is real advice for real, hard-wroking, middle-class people.	2005-03-11

I guess I am a bit outside of the age range that this is intended for being in my early 40's but I still found a lot of very valuable information inside.  Granted the book is squarely aimed at younger people who have just gotten out out college and are maybe a few years or more into their careers and faced with the bills of student loans.  The information though is of great value to me as my first child is only 5 years away from going to college and the information about financial assistance was invaluable.<br /><br />Thus while the information inside my not help me directly, I think it sets up a wonderful plan that we can use to its fullest extent when my son starts college as well as the years after.  This is always a very hard time, especially when \\"kids\\" get their first lines of credit and often make the same extent of forgetting that at some point the bills have to be paid.  I had some $15,000 in credit card debts, small compared to many I know, when I was in my early 30's and now have less than $2,000 which is very manageable.  If i had had this book 15 years ago I might not have found myself in such a rough position.  And certainly had I had the book I would have taken the advice about retirement plans much earlier than I did.  As Suze puts forth, getting that 401K setup as early as you can will make life much easier down the road.  Great Book!	2005-03-10

Little Critter books have always been favorites in our house.  My 13 year old loved them when he was very young and now my 2 1/2 year old loves them.  Mercer Mayers illustration style just seems to draw kids in as he captures the emotions of children in his own silly way.  As the title suggest this book has the Little Critter and his family celebrating Easter beginning with the kids finding the treats the Easter Bunny has left them.<br /><br />From there it's off to church service.  Little Critter does NOT like getting dressed up.  So much like some little boys that I know!  After church there's a big picnic where all of the kids dye their Easter Eggs and Little Critter thinks his are the best!  The eggs are then hidden and all the kids go on an Easter egg hunt.  Critter finds a lot but scowls when he misses one and someone else finds it.  It's all good fun!<br /><br />Now back home the kids finish their easter by digging into the wonderful treats that the Easter Bunny left them.  Kids really love this book because they see Little Critter enjoying all of the fun activities and treats that they will be enjoying on Easter Day.  Perfectly captures the spirit of Easter.

For the first two series under the Mirrorstone banner, they decided to stick with two subjects that they know very well:  Dragonlance and Dungeons & Dragons.<br /><br />Knights of the Silver Dragon is a Dungeons and Dragons series aimed at readers 8 - 12 years in age.  The stories center upon the exploits of three young heroes in the town of Curston.  Kellach, is a teenaged apprentice to the town's most powerful wizard, Zendric.  Kellach's brother, Driskoll, is an adventurous 12 year old who dreams of becoming a great warrior like his father Torin, the captain of the Curston's town watch.  The brothers are joined by their friend Moyra, a young female thief and daughter to one of Curston's most well known thieves, Breddo.<br /><br />Taking place shortly after the events in the first book, \\"Secret of the Spiritkeeper\\", book two, \\"Riddle in Stone\\" begins with the town of Curston having their annual Promise Festival, a celebration of Curston's glory days and the townspeople are enjoying fun, games and food.  Kellach and Driskoll walk about the town square sampling various treats from the many vendors selling their goods.  The Promise Festival includes a tradition of gift-giving and Driskoll receives a new sword from his father, Torin.  Kellach is anxious to receive his Promise gift from Zendric.  But underneath the celebration there is a foreboding air in Curston.  Watchers (Curston's city guard) have gone missing and the town even dedicated a statue to one young female watcher.<br /><br />The Boys join up with Moyra to go to the city Prison where her father Breddo is to be released but her father is NOT himself.  He appears to be drugged and is mumbling incoherently about something he saw in the lowest depths of the prison.  They hope to get some help from Zendric but when they pay him a visit, they overhear a suspicious conversation between Zendric and a mysterious, cloaked woman and fear that Zendric may be in on an evil plot.  Soon, most of the town's watch, including Captain Torin, have come under the influence of this mind-altering drug.  Kellach, Driskoll, and Moyra learn that the drug can be used to control minds and discover that the mysterious woman is actual one of the terrible Medusa's, whose look can turn anyone to stone.  At great risk, the trip uses a secret sewer entrance into the city prison to try and unravel the mystery.  They soon discover a series of riddles etched into several stone statues and make the horrifying discovery that these statues are victims of the Medusa.  Kellach finds an unlikely ally in a small, mechanical, but intelligent dragon that gives Kellach the ability to see through its eyes and understand the strange runes on the statues.  The brave trio of young heroes are now the only ones who can save Curston.<br /><br />\\"Riddle in Stone\\" has a decidedly different feel than the first book in the series.  It is less action-oriented and more a mystery requiring the solution of complex riddles.  Riddle-solving has always been an important element in playing Dungeons & Dragons, adding depth to games instead of making them mere hack-n-slash adventures.  Author Ree Soesbee constructed a clever who-done-it fantasy mystery that keeps readers guessing right up until the climax.  Kellach, Driskoll, and Moyra all show off their resourcefulness in this story.  Kellach uses his last available spell...a levitation spell...to escape from a group of bandits.  Moyra calls upon all of her young thievery skills to avoid several deadly traps and Driskoll displays his courage in sacrificing himself so Kellach and Moyra can escape.  Soesbee also did a good job in maintaining consistency with the various personalities and traits of the various characters.  That's something that's not always easy to do when different writers handle the same characters.<br /><br />Emily Fiegenshuh again provides both the book cover artwork along with several interior illustrations which have a distinct, although subtle, Japanese Anime influence to them.  Each of the books in the series check in right around 180 pages with short chapters that average 6 - 10 pages in length.  This is very important I think as it's much more fulfilling to put a book down for the night at the end of a chapter rather than in the middle.  Short chapters make it more motivating to read, especially for younger children.  Knights of the Silver Dragon has so far produced two very strong adventures which not only are fun to read, but also display admirable qualities about cooperation, teamwork, courage, and resourcefulness.  These are books that any fan of Dungeons & Dragons or fantasy in general will enjoy no matter what their age.<br /><br />Highly recommended!yra can escape.

The brothers are joined by their friend Moyra, a young female thief and daughter to one of Curston's most well known thieves, Breddo.<br /><br />In the first book, \\"Secret of the Spiritkeeper\\", Kellach is joined by Driskoll as he goes to Zendric's tower for his daily lesson in the art of wizardry.  However when they approach the tower they find the door wide open, highly unusual for Zendric.  When they enter, Kellach finds his mentor lying on the floor, apparently dead.  The tower has been ransacked and it appears that Zendric was the victim of thieves but Kellach finds that the only item that is missing is a strange, glowing orb that Zendric kept upon his mantle.  Soon, the boys father, Torin, shows up with several watchers to investigate and sends the boys home immediately.  Kellach believes that the orb has something to do with Zendric's death and believes that he can be restored to life if they find it.<br /><br />After sneaking into the city prison to speak to Moyra's father, they find out that it was a half-orc street thug who stole the orb.  They track him down but find that he has already sold the orb to a group of adventurers who have left town. They are headed to the Dungeons of Doom, whose denizens have troubled the people of Curston for many years and is the reason that people are not permitted to leave their homes after dark.  Torin is furious with his boys when he finds out what they've been up to and forbids them to leave the house, but Kellach knows that they are Zendric's only hope, so they sneak out of house to save him.  Now the three friends must enter the depths of those dangerous, trap-filled, underground passages, facing terrible creatures in order to find the magical orb that will hopefully restore Zendric to life.<br /><br />Reading \\"Secret of the Spiritkeeper\\" takes me back to the earliest days of when I first played Dungeons & Dragons back in the late 1970's.  In fact the adventure that these three companions went on was not unlike many of the early, low-level adventures that thrilled my friends and me when we first discovered the game.  The story has that strong feel of playing one of those old modules from the TSR days, with a mysterious town, threatened by monsters, and the always present underground dungeon that was the ultimate goal of players.  The book closely follows the spirit and rules of the game as Kellach carries the various components in his robes to cast his spells, and Moyra stealthily uses her thievery skills to pick locks and find traps.  It is a fantasy story, but one squarely set in the strong foundation of the Dungeons & Dragons universe.<br /><br />Author Matt Forbeck and the editors did a wonderful job of capturing the feel of the game in this well-plotted and action-oriented story.  The three main characters are all well-developed and have the same motivations and fears that kids reading the story have, making them easy to identify with.

As author Robb Walsh notes in his introduction, \\"Southern barbecue is a proud thoroughbred whose bloodlines are easily traced while Texas barbecue is a feisty mutt with a whole lot of crazy relatives.\\"  There are few things that Texans argue over more often than barbecue.  The book traces the diverse lineage of Texas barbecue and introduces us to the pit bosses and restaurant owners who have grown to mythical status in Texas.  Throughout, archival photographs highlight these men from as early as the start of the 1900's.<br /><br />Walter Jetton is perhaps the most influential pit boss in Texas barbecue history, once holding the record for feeding 12,000 people at a single event.  He was also a favorite of President Lyndon Johnson.  The early part of this book focuses on men such as Jetton and others, and gives a fascinating history of cooking methods and equipment these pioneering men used.<br /><br />The book then provides indispensable advice on achieving a Texas-style Barbecue at home including suggestions on the best equipment to use, fuels, and cook methods.  Forget the gas grill, even the use of smoke boxes will never achieve that true, smoky taste.  Utensils are also covered in detail including the one thing every good barbecuer needs...a basting mop.<br /><br />Moving to chapter two, the Legends of Texas Barbecue covers the \\"sport\\" of competitive cook-offs and masters such as Harley Goerlitz, holder of over 300 trophies including numerous championships.  These men provide some of their award winning recipes and sure-fire tips to making the best barbecue.  Even if you never plan to enter a cook-off, you'll find expert tips from these men that you can use at home.<br /><br />Rather than being sectioned like most cookbooks into type of foods, this book is sectioned off into regions.  East Texas, West Texas, Southern Texas, as well as the very notable influence of German immigrants of the 1800's and the black urban influence that began when Harvey Miller opened his barbecue joint in 1941.  Each section provides a sampling of recipes from these influences and it's interesting to note the differences in preparation, cooking, and spices in each.  Among the most interesting chapters from a historical perspective is the one that deals with the strong German influence on Texas Barbecue.  Texas became a hot spot for German Immigrants in the mid 1800's and continued for some fifty years.  This influence is still seen today in the barbecued sausages from this region.<br /><br />The Recipes are unique and mostly simple, having only a handful of ingredients.  Monte Barber's Country Style Ribs uses just orange juice, ribs, BBQ sauce and a basic rub. This is a recipe created by the legendary C.B. Stubblefield who lends his name to the famous Stubbs Barbecue sauces that are available throughout the country.  Then there is Drexler's Ribs from Houston restaurant owner James Drexler, smoked to perfection using just ribs. paprika, salt, sugar, and garlic and onion powders.  Simple and delectable.<br /><br />There's Potato and Black Bean Salsa Salad, BBQ Pork and Guacamole Sandwiches, Jalapeno Potato Salad, Barbecued Turkey, and more unique BBQ sauces than you've ever seen.  Whether it's ribs, brisket, steaks, chicken, sausages, vegetables or salads, you'll be sure to find many recipes to enjoy.<br /><br />The final chapter takes readers on a guided tour of the most famous Barbecues in Texas complete with addresses and phone numbers and a capsule history of each.  You're invited to make a pilgrimage to the Texas barbecue belt towns of Lockhart, Elgin, and Taylor to visit some of the most famous barbecue joints not only in Texas, but the entire country!

Have you ever visited a city on vacation and wanted to know where to find the very best pizza?  Well look no further than this well-written and comprehenisive guide to America's favorite food...Pizza!  Food Writer Ed Levine who has had a lifelong love affair with Pizza provides the info in this outstanding book that comes in the year when Lombardi's in New York celebrates its 100th anniversary as the first licensed pizzeria.<br /><br />Levine spent over a year touring over 200 pizzerias in 20 states, Canada, and Pizza's native home of Naples, Italy and sampled thousands of slices to provide the necessary ammo for this ambitious book.  But not only that, Levine consulted with the food writers in the various cities he visited with many contributing essays on pizza for the book.  Levine visited the mom & pop pizzerias as well as the major chains.  Levine doesn't try to hid his disdain for the big chains noting that, \\"It kills me when people say Pizza Hut's great.\\"  He has similar dislike for frozen pizza, even the new, gourmet rising crust pizzas don't grab accolades from him.<br /><br />But more than that Levine reveals how passionate people are about good pizza and how people can vividly recall their favorite pizza joints even if they are no longer around.  He guesses that perhaps only 1,000 pizzerias out of 63,000 serve something better than mediocre, a sobering thought to those of us who truly love a good pizza.<br /><br />Clearly Levine favors Northeastern part of the country due to their long Italian heritage but Levine has found many good pizzas in the south and west as well such as Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix.  Perhaps Levine's biggest excitement comes not with the the pizzerias that have been around for generations, but with many of the new stores with chefs who adopt old ways such as wood burning stone ovens for the perfect crust.<br /><br />Just a fun and fascinating book and indispensable for any pizza lover.	2005-03-01

And as such, it works quite humorously as sort of a quasi-science book...a field guide to the species of Flanimals, filled with marvelous illustrations of each of the 26 flanimals and witty text detailing a brief summary of their behavior, their specialized body features, and how this all effects their psychology.<br /><br />The book also details how the various Flanimals interact or react to other Flanimal species.  You'll see how a  as a Grundit stamps out a Coddleflop!  You'll observe a baby Munty Fumple as it naps...so cute!  In chapter three you will put your knowledge to the test and try to identify the Flanimal species by their footprints or by their behavior patterns.<br /><br />Through it all Rob Steens wildly cartoonish and garish illustrations bring the Flanimals to life before your eyes.  Think of Flanimals as Dr. Seuss for the 21st century with it's bizarre text and equally bizarre illustrations.  Kids will love the crazy names such as Clunge Ambler that looks like someone's big toe or the Offledermis that: \\"Born completely inside out\\", this offensive little beast \\"lives inside itself to avoid its own smell.\\"<br /><br />Truly hilarious and wild stuff.

Although his American Indian heritage is only one part of an ethnic background that includes Slovak and English blood, those Native roots are the ones by which he has been most nourished.<br /><br />In Skeleton Man, Bruchac delves into an ancient Mohawk Indian legend of the Skeleton Man, who devours himself and everyone around him.  In this story, a girl named Molly is forced to live with a creepy great uncle she never knew about before.  The man is bony and pale and she is immediately reminded of the Skeleton Man legend, a tale her father once told her about.  At night she is locked in her room and haunted by a voice in her dreams.  She suspects that his uncle may really be the Skeleton Man but how does she escape?<br /><br />Bruchac carefully builds up the tension and terror for the young girl as the book goes on.  Molly, a thoroughly modern adolescent, embraces her Native American heritage and uses it to help her solve the mystery of her parents disappearance and the escalating terror of life in her uncle's house.  Bruchac keeps the story moving briskly from beginning to end.<br /><br />A marvelously intelligent and creepy storyline for young readers.  In Molly, Bruchac has eschewed the stereotypical female characters and given us a smart, resourceful young lady.  Scared yes, but able to deal with her situation and use her wits to escape.	2005-02-24

I've been doing Thanksgiving dinner for my family for over ten years and each ear I seek out at least one or two new recipes to try out on my guinea pigs....errr...guests.  This book is culled from the most wonderful recipe site on the internet, allrecipes.com.  Long has this been a favored site of mine and millions of other cooks as well.  The editors have pulled together 200 of the finest holiday recipes for inclusion in the book.<br /><br />Among the most valuable sections is the one on preparing for the big feast.  it covers what can be done a month before such as getting the invitations out, ordering the turkey or ham, etc.  Then we move to two weeks before and prepare by getting making sure you have all the necessary utensils, roasters, and pots, and figuring out where to sit people and your needed space.  All this leads up to the big day as you cook the bird and prepare everything else.<br /><br />From there we move to the recipes and everything from a traditional roasted turkey, to prime rib, deep fried turkey, Alaskan baked Salmon, and honey glazed turkey.  I admit I stick to the traditional turkey but I love the vast amount of wonderful side dish recipes.  This past Thanksgiving I gave the cheesy green beans a whirl and they were a big hit.  Rolls, stuffings, veggies, appetizers..they're all here and well represented.  Ahh...and don't forget the deserts!  Chocolate Chip Pumpkin bread!  Wow...that was some good stuff!<br /><br />The index is well presented and the recipes canebe found under several listings.  For example the Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Bread will be found under Chocolate, Pumpkin and Breads, making for easy finding.  This is one I just love to pull out when November rolls around.  A fantastic book!	2005-02-21

When I signed up for the Sci-Fi book club several years ago I received the first four books in the Sword of Truth series.  The Sci-Fi book club just raved about them being the next great epic fantasy to rival Tolkien.  I should have remembered that job one of the book club is to SELL books.  Letting it's potential members know their selections were coma inducing would not have been good for business.  I managed to get through the first book and since I had the nect three I figured I should read them.  Well, the second was as far as I got and I ended up trading them all in at a used book store without ever opening up books three and four.<br /><br />To Briefly summarize, Richard and Kahlan, easily the most lackluster characters to ever see print in a fantasy, are back.  Richard is having trouble controling his powers and is getting bad headaches (although I bet they were nothing compared to the ones I got trying to get through this).  The Sisters of Light, a Quasi-Religious group of fanatics who train wizards offer to help.  Well, not really offer, more or less force themselve on Richard.  Meanwhile Kahlan is off to the Council of the Midlands, dodging all sorts of trouble along the way including a prophecy that she must be executed.<br /><br />And thus the bulk of the tale becomes these separate, long, ponderous Journies with a lot of muck about prophesies.  Goodkind certainly loves to see his words in print that's for sure.  Never was so many pages spent accomplishing so little.  I didn't care much for the characters in the first book but now I basically despise both of them.<br /><br />The only way I would recommend this book is if you have a sleep disorder...or need a good paperweight.	2005-02-21

An anti-hero in every sense of the word.  No super powers to speak of Constantine is a foul, and foul-mouthed, chain-smoking part wizard, part detective, part demonologist.  His is a world lower than the most seedy underbelly.  He's a man who has seen the kind of death, sorrow, and evil that would drive the average man insane, and perhaps has already done so to Constantine.<br /><br />This Warren Ellis tale tells of an old lover named Isabelle who is horribly murdered.  John investigates to find that his old friend had died as a cheap prostitute barely living on the fringes of society.  John eventually finds out she came under the domination of a rival mage who did unspeakable things to her before killing her.  REluctantly John needs help and calls upon a couple of old friends.  The ending...well, to say the ending was one of the more disturbing things I've ever read or seen in a comic would be understating it.  It's not pretty, but then that is Constantine's world.  The graphic novel was illustrated by John Higgins and while I'm not crazy about some of these more abstract comic artists, his gritty style certainly fit the story.	2005-02-21

It is comprehensive, layed out well in its format and sections, as well as providing informative information on the hobby or business of toy collecting.  Each year Krause does a better job of including more modern day toys as there are so many companies now producing toys specifically for a collectors market.  Like any good book the Krause guide provides manufacturer, year and of course condition based prices.<br /><br />While No one guide can ever be totally comprehensive, Krause is one I buy every two years or so along with the Schroeder toy price guide.  Those two I think provide the best wealth of information and accuracy of any toy price guides.	2005-02-18

This novel takes place in what most people consider Buffy's prime, namely the third season where she is a senior at Sunnydale high school.  The school has an attractive new history teacher named Crystal Gordon who just happens to be the reincarnation of an ancient primal witch. She needs to recruit and essentially use some students in order to regain her full powers.  Buffy immediately notices something not right and the two share a strong dislike for each other.  While Buffy shares her concern with Giles and the rest of the gang, Crystal is recruiting students to her cause...including Willow.  Now the Scoobies have to stop the witch and rescue Willow before she becomes to powerful to stop.<br /><br />Diana Gallagher has a good feel for the character of the Buffy-verse and the various characters talk and act just as they do on the TV show.  Of course part of that is due to the control that Fox puts on the writers of these books.  I understand they have pretty tight reins and call for lots of re-writes.  The book does bog down a bit in the research phase of things as we learn about Crystals past but all in all it's a good effort and one of the better of the original Buffy novels.	2005-02-18

The Nightside is a dirty, secret little underbelly of London where it is always 3AM, and where creatues both foul and mythical, mix amongst the dark and dangerous steets.  This book begins not long after the events in \\"Agents of Light & Darkness\\" and while this book does make reference to those events, it's not necessary to have read that one first, although it does help.<br /><br />John Taylor has just solved the murder of two friends who died during their own wedding several years earlier and in doing so, destroys the Prometheus power plant, knocking out power to over 12% of the Nightside.  This causes much damage and chaos in the Nightside and John finds himself on the run from Walker, the representative of The Authorities, the true power in the city.<br /><br />John Taylor is a private detective with a gift that allows him to find anything or anyone and is contacted by a wealthy banker to find his missing daughter who ran off to the Nightside to become a singer.  Taylor finds the daughter whose taken the stage name of Rossignol working in a night club and under the control of The Cavendish's, a mysterious and wealthy couple.  But there's a problem.  Seems people have the odd habit of commiting suicide after hearing Rossignol sing and John must not only find out why, but also find a way to free her from the clutches of the Cavendish's who are backed up by the power of Count Entropy.<br /><br />This book introduces us to yet another of John's sometime allies, the teenage boy know as \\"Dead Boy\\", who is dead himself, yet lives on eternally, holding his body together with stitches and duct tape.  Dead Boy happens to be the foremost expert on death, and John enlists his aid in order to solve this latest mystery.<br /><br />With each book, Simon Green begins to reveal just a tiny bit more about the mysterious John Taylor and his inhuman mother.  Even when Taylor encounters a group of primal demons, older than creation, he sees fear in their eyes as they know WHAT he is...or will be someday.<br /><br />DeadBoy was a welcome addition to John's list of friends which include Shotgun Suzie and Razor Eddie.  Deadboy behaves much as any teenager does but with a deep sorrow underneath as he mournfully states that the longer he is dead, the less feeling he has for anything in his life/death.<br /><br />Nighingale's Lament moved at a very brisk pace and Green gives readers little time to catch their breath as Taylor moves from one dangerous encounter to the next.  But then that is one of the appeals of the Nightside books.  With each one just over 200 pages, these are quick, exciting little diversions from much of the more epic and exhausting fantasies on the market today.

I had always found him a little too \\"out there\\".  It was my fault.  I just wasn't getting where he was coming from.  But at some point, I think during one of his Thanksgiving shows, a light bulb popped on and I thought, \\"Ahhh...now I see!\\"  Brown isn't your typical Food TV chef.  Like Rachael Ray, Brown was more a food fan, than chef, a man who came from a background of directing TV commercials and music videos.  And it is that background behind the camera that makes him so endearing on camera...the quirkiness, the slightly left of nutty as Brown explains the kinds of things you don't normally see on cooking shows or in cook books.<br /><br />And so it goes with this book.  More than just presenting recipes Brown, in his witty, off-beat style educates on cooking and cooking techniques.  Brown explores the science of cooking (and don't let the word science intimidate you).  You will also learn what to and what not to boil, microwave, bake, roast, and broil. There are even a few handy inventions such as making a heat blower out of a pipe and a hair dryer to get those coals in your grill hotter quicker, longer, and better.<br /><br />Rather than laying out his cookbook in standard fashion with types of foods, Browns book is sectioned off by cooking method Such as grilling, Roasting, boiling, and frying.  That's because Brown believes that how you cook is everybit as important as what you cook.  This may be the most unique cookbook you will ever find.  Informative and entertaining.  A true joy to read.	2005-02-18

They are taken in by a tribe of cavemen and provided food and animal skins to wear.  In a cave they come upon some drawings on the wall that will lead them to their next clue as well as a deadly trap!<br /><br />This book certainly gave Jack and Annie a harrowing adventure.  Annie's impetuous nature put the duo in danger by wishing them to the frozen land unprepared for the hardships of cold and snow.  This was a step up I thought from the last two books in the four part story as we build to the climax in the next book.  Once again features great illustrations by Sal Murdocha.	2005-02-17

But I have to say even as an \\"old\\" comic fan this has to be one of the best Thor Storylines to come along in the over 30 years I've been a fan.  The trade paperback collects Thor issues #80 - 85 in the Avengers Disassembled tie-in.  The simple fact of the matter is that watching Asgard come under attack by a host of Thor's enemies who are each bearing their own versions of the mjolnir makes for a fantastically orginal plot.<br /><br />The art is pretty solid, as Andrea Divito delivers the story in a visually exciting, slambang manner, and the big impact visuals pack a nice punch.  There's also some solid action shots like the sequence where Captain America's shield shows up to rescue Thor from the gaping jaws of the Fenris wolf.<br /><br />Finally the end is just something you would not expect as the demon Surtur is finally released on Asgard.  just an outstanding story from beginning to end with solid artwork, terrific battle scenes, as Mike Avon Oeming, builds to an Asgard-shattering climax.  Highly recommended!	2005-02-17

The kids are excited to this time travel to the Amazon rain forest where Jack hopes to discover a new insect species.  Jack and Annie, along with a clever monkey begin a journey down the Amazon in a canoe, unaware of the dangers they will soon be encountering.<br /><br />This book is probably less filled with danger than any of the previous installments.  There are no real villians in this book for the first time and the main dangers are the various native creatures in the Amazon so there is a decidedly unthreatening feel to this book.  Mainly this book is all about Jack and Annie trying to find the next item they need in the vast Amazon.  Perhaps a bit slower than readers have become accustomed to.  The book is illustrated by Sal Murdocca and again he does a fine job.  We're halfway through the story!	2005-02-17

He has his own potty...he knows how to sit on it and what it's used for.  Now it's all about getting him to know when to use it.  Karen Katz has been putting out wonderful books for babies and toddlers for so long that she was the natural choice when we were looking for a fun book to read about potty training.<br /><br />With interactive gatefold flaps, this book addresses the perennial toddler issue of potty training. In a very realistic, child-appealing text, it describes how a gender-neutral toddler struggles to learn how to use the potty.  As with her other books Karen has illustrated this lift the flap book with fun, colorful pictures that kids relate so well to.  My son really gets a kick out of seeing the child sitting on the potty.  Hopefully it will payoff very soon.  Highly recommended!	2005-02-17

Batman is nearly killed in the first part and is nursed back to health by a doctor who was a childhood friend, Dr. Thomas Elliot.<br /><br />There are plenty of plot-twists as Batman tries to unravel the mysteries of Hush.  In fact there are a bit too many plot twists which seem to be thrown out to beef up what could have been a rather simple plot.  If Hush really wanted Batman dead there certainly was ample opportunity.  If the villain wants simply to inflict a grievous defeat on Batman, and he knows that Bruce Wayne is Batman, why not destroy him simply by revealing this to the world?<br /><br />The revealing of Hush was anti-climactic to say the list.  Guessing the identity would not take a master detective.  If I could figure it out then certaintly Batman should have a LONG time before that.  We know that Jim Lee always wanted to work on Batman. It would seem that he also always wanted to draw every notable Batman villian...whether they were central to the plot or just brought in for a cameo as many of them were.  So what we get is some beautifully rendered fight scenes as Batman battles the various villians, held together by an angel hair plot.  Unfortunately this is what happens when a popular artist is given too much power.  It's the mistake Marvel made in the 90's when they turned over their major characters to the hot artists of the day like Lee, Liefeld, McFarlane, and others.  Hush vol. 2 has a bit more substance, but not by much.	2005-02-17

A spell has been cast on Morgan Le Fay and she needs Jack & Annie to retrieve some items to help her.  The Kids must use the Magic Tree house to travel back to ancient Japan to find the clues to the latest mystery.  They encounter some Ninja Warriors who turn out to be the good guys and the Ninja Master assists the kids on their quest.  But they soon come under attack by a horde of Samurai Warriors, who threaten their mission.<br /><br />This book actually starts a new story arc that will play out over books #5 - 8 in the series and is called the Mystery of the Magic Spell.  I like the way Mary Pope Osborne has written these books to be stand alone adventures and yet all four to be part of one 4 book story arc.  This one loved at a bit of a slower pace than some of the previous books.  There wasn't the chills as their were in Mummies in the Morning, for example.  But still a solid effort with excellent illustrations by Sal Murdocha.	2005-02-17

A man who made sacrifices to do what he believed in.  Support the war in Iraq or not, one cannot deny the valor and determination of Captain DAvid Rozelle.<br /><br />This book tells the story of Captain Rozelle and his duty in Iraq.  We read the tale of how Captain Rozelle,  like so many of our brave soldiers, left behind a family to do his duty in Iraq.  Here is a man who led his troops into battle, often the first to enter captured cities and a man who actually had a bounty placed on his head by Iraqi insurgents.  This was truly a soldier who put fear into his enemies.<br /><br />Rozelle then lost his right foot to an anti-personnel mine in 2003.  But the story only begins there as Rozelle, showing what can only be described as superhuman determination, not only recoved from his injuries, but returned to Iraq a year later to resume his duty, this time as the commander of an armored cavalry group.<br /><br />Rozelle takes us through the months of agonizing rehabilitation he endured as he learned to not only walk, but run and compete athletically with his new prosthetic foot.  Here was a man who was awarded every possible medal and could have remained home, safe in the knowledge that he had performed heroically, yet that was not enough.  To Rozelle his job simply was not complete.  This is an incredible, inspirational tale of courage, strength, and patriotism.  This man defines patriotism.  Everyone of us should be tipping our hat to him and all the soldiers just like him who are doing their duty for their country.	2005-02-16

Still...this is the beginning as we learn how the NJ cop Remo Williams gets the chair for murder and is then resuscitated and recruited by a super secret agency Known as CURE.  Remo is trained in the deadly Korean martial art known as Sinanju by Chiun, master assasin, and uses his new skills to battle evil under the guidance of CURE's director, Smith.<br /><br />The first book really doesn't develop any of the characters with the personalities that they would come to have once the series took off but it is still notable as THE first and as such deserves a place of honor.  It's rather slow moving but historical still.	2005-02-16

The best advice if one wants to eat healthy at a fast food place is...don't!  But let's face it...most of us simply are not going to heed that advice because our lives are so on the go that fast food is often not only the best option but the only option, particularly for lunch.<br /><br />Bob Green's book takes you through just about any fast food chain you can think of as well as many of the more medium-priced sit down chains such as Applebees, Bennigans, Red Lobster, and more.  You're sure to find your favorites from McDonalds to Arbys and Quizno's to Jack in the Box.  Even pizza chains like Dominos, Little Caesers and Pizza hut.  Bob provides the best choices for healthy eating at all of these establishments complete with all the nutritional information you'll need to make an educated selection.  Bob even gives suggestions for beverages as well.<br /><br />Most of the selections should be fairly common sense among eaters,  Obviously a grilled chicken sandwich without the mayo is going to be much better for you than that double Whopper with cheese, but it's still nice to have all the selections and nutritional information in one neat little book.	2005-02-16

In a storm several crates were swept off the ship and these little rubber ducks floated virtually all over the world.  I guess maybe that story influenced this Eric Carle books about a bunch of toy ducks that pop out of a machine freshly painted and packed 10 to a box and loaded onto a ship.<br /><br />A box of 10 goes overboard and each of the 10 little ducks goes on their own separate journey of exploration and adventure to all parts of the globe.  One even encounters a mother duck with her own little duckling children.  It's a delightful tale and beautifully illustrated, as you would expect, by Carle.  His use of colors in his collages is dazzling.  If you've had his previous books and enjoyed them, you're sure to love this one too.	2005-02-15

My neighbor gave me this book when she was moving a couple of years ago and I moved shortly after so it satayed packed away in a box along with several other cook books until just recently.  Tiring of stopping for fast food or making the same quick meals like spaghetti or tacos, I figured I'd give this one a whirl.<br /><br />I've typically found that in many of these books that promises quick, good meals in 30 minutes or whatever, that it generally takes you longer.  I don't know whether the authors are just cooking under optimal conditions or I'm just slow.  I suspect it's a bit of both.  Still even at 40 minutes or so, Beverly Mills and Alica Ross whip up some very hearty meals always with ingredients that are either in your pantry or easily found at the grocery store.  No scouring exotic gourmet food stores with this book.<br /><br />The book is arranged by section starting with soups, then moving on to stews, Skillet meals, salads, Entrees, Veggies, etc...All very well formatted although unfortunately no color photography.  The recipes range from typical American fare like hamburgers and baked chicken to Asian, Mexican, and even Caribbean dishes.  My family really enjoyed the chicken Fingers Parmesan, easily made with refrigerated or frozen chicken fingers.  I also love the Potato corn chowder that was very rib sticking on a cold day.  The selection of salads is very strong too with some excellent seafood, pasta, and traditional salads.<br /><br />Desperation Dinners is a solid cookbook.  It's the kind you will probably find a half dozen receipes you really like and will make over and over again.	2005-02-15

Long before the Food Network came along I made sure to take my lunch hour so I could coincide with Martin's \\"Yan Can Cook\\" show on PBS in the afternoons.  Martin was always very entertaining and made meals so quick and easy.  That style comes across strongly in his latest book which has 150 recipes all designed to be prepared in 30 minutes or less!  Ok...it might take you a little longer since most of us are not as fast with a chef's knife as Martin is, but you get the idea...<br /><br />Martin starts by passing along his wisdom on the best tools to use for preparing Chinese dishes and the techniques used to make them delicious.  If you've followed Martin's shows you'll be familiar with some of it but there's a lot more I learned that was new.  Kung Pao chicken is a favorite of mine so I was happy to see a recipe for Kung Pao sauce.  Also not to be missed is the Ginger Chicken, and black pepper Beef.<br /><br />And it's not all limited to Chinese foods.  There are korean, Japanese, Taiwanese, Vietnamese recipes as well.

Filled with expert tips and gorgeous photography, Lidia will get you motivated to make the kinds of dishes you always thought might be beyond your skill.  More than just providing instruction, Lidia truly has a reverence for food and cooking often lost in our on the go society today.<br /><br />Italian cooking can be imposing and who really has the time or the nerve to make your own pasta at home?  But with so many fresh pasta available in stores today you needn't be intimidated.  Lidia starts out with the traditional Antipasta before moving onto sections on seafood, sauces, soups, pizza, and so much more.  Best of all is specialized sections which deal with subjects Classic italian-American dishes, Quick dinners, snacks, large parties, etc.  Truly a plan for every occasion.<br /><br />The first recipe I made was the Chicken Scallopine Marsala which was just fantastic.

Willow is among the wounded and Oz and Cordelia are missing in action.  Buffy, who was away with Angel returns to find Sunnydale more on edge than its ever been and the town seems to have degenerated into blind madness.<br /><br />Buffy and Giles suspect there's much more to the towns carzed attitude than just being upset over the School shootings and find that a couple of vampires have cooked up a malicious plot in Sunnydale.  As Buffy novels go this is one of the darker ones, especially considering the destruction of Sunnydale high episode was delayed due to the Columbine shootings.  This certainly gives this story a grimmer tone than many of the other original novels and I would hazzard to guess that they'd never try to do a story like this on TV.<br /><br />A good but decidedly downbeat and dark Buffy story.	2005-02-10

He'd have come up with Harry Dresden...a gumshoe, flatfoot detective who happens to be a wizard in modern day Chicago where magic is real and creatures such as demons and faeries really do exist.  In a seedy office in a seedy building is where Harry has his office and takes on a case involving a missing husband.<br /><br />Before he can get working on that case, he's called in by the local police to consult on a brutal double murder of a man and woman, killed in the throes of passion, as their hearts seemingly exploded right out of their chests.  Harry soon finds himself under pressure from the police as well as the local mob boss as the male victim was one of his underlings.  On top of that, the White Council, governing body of wizards, already is watching Harry closely due to an early incident.<br /><br />Harry soon finds himself knee deep in trouble facing demons, vampires, as well as a rogue wizard who is targeting Harry for the same fate as the first two victims.  Through it all Harry uses his magical skills as well as good old fashioned detective work to begin putting together the clues of the murders and the missing husband.<br /><br />Part detective, and part Urban fantasy, Jim Butcher's first book in the Dresden files came as a surprise and a big breath of fresh air from much of the fantasy on book shelfs today.  Written with the sarcastic sneer, and told in first person perspective, one almost pictures Harry in a hot, dimly lit office with a slow moving fan rotating but not helping much.  Harry Dresden isn't a hero's hero or man's man.  A rather bland guy, not so fit who travels about in a VW bug with mismatching door paint.  Harry is a hero, just a guy being what he is, in this case a wizard.<br /><br />The who-done-it mystery wasn't terribly hard to figure out, but the plot layers involving the magically produced street drug that makes crack look like bubble gum was fun, and briskly paced.  It's nice to see a hero who gets out of tight spots using his brain rather than just his brawn.  Harry is almost like the wizard version of McGyver with the way he manages to escape certain death.<br /><br />Excellent first book in the series and I look forward to reading the others.g his brain rather than just his brawn.

The book actually reprints all the Peanuts strips from the calendar year 1998 in chronological order, complete with the dates in the daily strips.  This really is the best way to enjoy any comic strip because Shulz of course did have storylines that would run over the course of many days, if not a few weeks. The daily strips are actually in color as well as the Sundays although sometimes the colors seemed to have been rushed or off a bit from panel to panel.<br /><br />We see the usual Schulz plot elements here, Baseball games, preparing for the Great Pumpkin, Lucy flirting with Schroeder, Snoopy's writing career, etc...Rerun plays a fairly big part in this collection as he's developed and fleshed out quite a bit than he had been since his arrival and was Schulz's last major addition to the cast, even though he was not the most popular amongst Peanut's fans.<br /><br />There are a lot of hits, and a few misses; some rely on specific reactions to the outside world which I do not share. But then, some of the ones that other people would find to be non-sequitors, I find brilliant, because I can see what's going on in the character's head.<br /><br />All in all, quite an enjoyable book.	2005-02-10

Our in boxes being not only the things on our desks, but applying to anything task we need to do in our lives no matter how mundane.  Allen has what he refers to as the \\"Two Minute Rule\\" wherein if there's anything you absolutely must do that you can do right now in two minutes or less, then do it now, thus freeing up your time and mind tenfold over the long term.

He made sure we saved these so he could pass them on to his little brother to read to him once he is old enough.  These are simple chapter books.  They range in page count from about 68 to 96 pages I believe so they are relatively quick reads that can be read in a few nights depending upon your child's reading level.  This set contains the first four books in the series:<br /><br />Book #1, DINOSAURS BEFORE DARK<br /><br />Book #2, THE KNIGHT AT DAWN<br /><br />Book #3, MUMMIES IN THE MORNING<br /><br />Book #4, PIRATES PAST NOON<br /><br />The First, Dinosaurs Before Dawn tells the story of how jack and Annie (the series stars) first find the Magic Tree House and learn how the books can transport them to magical lands and worlds.  The first takes them to the Cretaceous period. Through clues and reading the book in hand they learn and discover things about dinosaurs.<br /><br />In the \\"Knight at Dawn\\", jack and Annie are transported back to medieval times.  They find a castle and go exploring and find themselves on the run from the castle guards and worry they will never get back to the magic tree house.<br /><br />\\"mummies In the Morning\\" Jack has always been fascinated by and pick up a book that has them traveling back to ancient Egypt.  Jack and Annie enter a pyramid and get lost inside.  Inside they find the ghost of an Egyptian queen whose been trapped inside the pyramid for ages and Jack and Annie try to set her free.<br /><br />\\"Pirates Past Noon\\"  Jack and Annie picture a wonderful beach and are transported to the times of Pirates where they are capture by Captain Bones who is seeking the treasure of Captain Kidd.<br /><br />These books are geared for kids from the 2nd to the 5th grade I would say.  They are entertaining, imaginative reads that help teach kids about history while being fun to read as well.  Some have commented that the writing, technically speaking is weak.  That may be in some spots but I feel this is mostly intentional as they are writing for 6 - 10 year olds.<br /><br />These books are really a joy to read and I loved reading them along with my son.

This is a great Christmas themed book where kids can touch Santa's soft, fluffy bear, push the soft, squishy nose of a reindeer, touch the shiny red christmas ornament, and so on...One can, I suppose question the educational value of these books but why must all books be educational?  Bottom line is that all of these books are fun for kids to read and touch.	2005-02-07

Quite a landmark indeed for Mary Pope Osborne who has been wowing elementary school kids with these imaginative tales of time travel to mythical and fantastic lands for a long time.  Jack and Annie are summoned again by Merlin to the enchanted land of Camelot.  They are to journey to a haunted castle to find the stolen Stone of Destiny.  They are joined in this adventure by Teddy, the apprentice wizard to Morgan le Fay.  At the castle they encounter all manner of spooks in their quest.<br /><br />My son loved these when he was elementary school age.  His eyese lit up every time he received a new one.  He made sure we saved all of his books in the series so that he could pass them onto his little brother once he becomes old enough to read them.  These are great imaginative and fun reads for kids...and adults who read along.	2005-02-07

Author Max Brooks has compiled a thoroughly researched and altogether hilarious spoof of zombie culture with his survival guide.  And who knows...if Zombies ever really do walk the earth someday, you'll be mighty happy you have this book.<br /><br />While based in the lore of George Romero's zombie films, Brooks expands it further past film and fiction and explores real life zombies.  For the first time we get and in-depth description of the virus that causes this plaugue and a well-thought out, step-by-step breakdown of how the virus attacks the body and what exactly happens.  I love the medical analysis Brooks provides about the zombies sense of smell and taste, making you realize full well that you could NEVER disguise yourself as a zombie by shuffling down the street as they did in \\"Shaun of the Dead\\".  The zombies would pick up the scent of your living flesh and tear you to pieces!<br /><br />While quite humorous this book is really written rather seriously as if it was an actual text book and Brooks never lets down his guard and you become immersed in the text, making you wonder what would happen if the world were overrun by zombies.  You'll get all the tips you need on battling and surviving zombie hordes with suggestions on the safest places to take refuge as well as weapon selection.<br /><br />For any fan of Zombie films, The Zombie Survival Guide : Complete Protection from the Living Dead is an absolute must read...because you never know...	2005-02-04

I AM A WING NUT!	i came to be a fan of Wings relatively late, only a couple of years ago.  I always consdidered them not worth the trouble to make or eat given the amount of meat on the bones.  But I was really transformed a few years ago at a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant and their many varieties of wings and sauces.  They were not just heat but spice as well and i soon began experimenting with my own buffalo style wings and hit upon a method that friends always demand.  I would put mine at medium hot in terms of their heat.<br /><br />This wonderful little book comes along with 150 wing recipes from traditional buffalo wings to international recipes from the Caribbean, Italy, Japan, Mexico, and more.  There are so many varieties that you just won't know where to begin.  I've only made about a half dozen which I always make 3 or 4 different varieties of wings for parties.<br /><br />The Cajun Wings are a nice change of pace with the Cajun spices making it still hot but with a distinctly different taste than the average hot wing.  There's the Die-Hard Dijon wings with a fantastic savory flavor.  And of course Teriyaki wings are one of my favorites.  But it's not just wings.  There's receipes for dipping sauces as well as a number of salads to compliment the wings.  Truly an indispensible book for any wing fan!	2005-02-03

Here is a book which focuses on thinking without thinking...in other words the point being that using intuition, hunches, or just plain old gut feelings is often better than using logical, deliberate thinking.  Interesting concept...going with your gut feeling, right?<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell shares the results of recent research in psychology and related disciplines, such as neuroscience, which not only confirm the importance of intuitive cognition in human beings but also offer a qualified vindication of it. He argues that intuition is often superior to articulate thinking.<br /><br />Gladwell shares a number of anecdotal examples of where intuition both triumphed and failed, leading him to the conclusion that while both intuitive thinking and cognitive thinking both have their benefits and pratfalls, going with one's gut feeling is often going to be the better choice of the two as long as one is aware of any lurking bear traps, so to speak.<br /><br />The problem with the book is that for all its pseudo-technical terminology of using phrases like \\"mind-blindness\\" and \\"thin-slicing\\", the bottom line is that there really is no concrete scientific evidence to support his beliefs.  In essence, he is using his own gut feelings and beliefs to support his theories.  And how's that for logic!  Still, whether you believe Gladwell or not, the fact remains that the book is a very entertaining read.  The many examples Gladwell submits will put a smile on your face at least until you start shooting holes in them.	2005-02-01

They are led by an ex-police officer named Rick and as the season changes to winter the group moves south to try to scavenge for food and a warm place to take refuge.  After a false, deadly start at a suburban housing development, the group is able to take up a brief residence at a nearby farm packed with its own dark secrets.<br /><br />The characters are all a little too dark and react too much the same as the rest, all seemingly in shock and retreating into a shell.  The dialog is also extremely stiff with stereotypical \\"b\\" movie type responses.  Clearly the writers have a fondness for George Romero and clearly they don't realize that what may be ok for a 90 minute movie doesn't play so well over a 12 issue plus comic series.  One would hope with a less that original plot that perhaps some original characters would be developed.  The artwork has been pretty good throughout even with the change to new artist Charlie Adlard.<br /><br />Not to say that The Walking Dead is bad, mind you.  For what it is, it does a good job.  It's just not terribly original.	2005-02-01

Soup and winter just goes together even though this book contains many lighter receipes that can be enjoyed all year round.<br /><br />This is a follow-up to the Big Book of Casseroles and contains receipes for over 250 soups, stews, and chowders.  Some very elegant soups perfect for a formal dinner party to go along with stick to your ribs soups for tailgating before a big game.  There's old classic favorites such as Chicken Noodle, Motzah Ball and Clam Chowder to go along with more exotic soups such as the Thai Ginger Chicken Soup and Spicy Cuban Pork Stew.  One of my favorites is the Chicken with Buttermilk Thyme dumplings which is just fantastic in the dead of winter like it is now.  There are several potato soup recipes which I absolutely love including the baked potato soup.<br /><br />The recipes are fairly simple to make and most of the ingredients are availabe from the grocery store but a few will require a visit to a gourmet food store if you really want to do it right.  This book is a soup-eaters dream!	2005-01-31

My combination method of first baking then quickly frying to get a crispness before tossing in Frank's Hot Sauce along with a few added ingredients has allowed me to very nearly duplicate the taste of the Wings from the legendary Anchor bar...or so friends have told me so.<br /><br />Still...there are many ways of doing tasty wings, especially when entertaining guests who want a little less fire.  When we entertain I usually make three types of wings: My standard, and a couple of mild to medium hot varieties that favor more spice over hear.  \\"Wing it\\" has been added to my collection and provides several outstanding wing recipes that our flavorful without making your eyes water.  The Sesame Wings are a particular favorite of a friend of mine who insists I make them every time he comes over.<br /><br />Oddly Enough I'm not crazy about Mr. O'hara's recipe for his Classic Buffalo Wings for the simple reason I don't like my buffalo wings to be battered because if they sit for two long the batter soaks up the sauce rendering the wings with a spongy texture.<br /><br />Solid book with the rest of the recipes though.	2005-01-31

I've been a fan of Martin yan's ever since seeing him on PBS some 15 years ago or so.  Before Emeril came along Yan was one of the few TV cooks who tried to entertain as well as educate on cooking.  I'm quite disappointed he's no long on the Food Network anymore as I just don't see him pop up on PBS that often but maybe I am just missing him.<br /><br />I was able to pickup this book on the bargain Rack at the local Mediaplay for just a few bucks so it was well worth the price.  Different than his other books, Martin takes on a guided world tour to various Chinatowns around the world including San Francisco, Sydney and Yokohama, complete with brief histories and Yan's recommendations on restaurants to visit in each chinatown.<br /><br />The Recipes are grouped by course. Some of the recipes are pictured; all included a brief introduction, telling a bit about the recipe or hints to making the dish.  The directions are easy to follow once you became acquainted with the ingredients. Any questions are easily solved by a trip to the Asian Market or a quick look at the Chinese Pantry section. The Chinese ingredients and many other less common ingredients in the recipes were covered in this Section.<br /><br />The index, an important area of any cookbook, is great! If you want a duck recipe, look up duck. If you want an appetizer, you got it. Recipes can also be found under their name as well as various main ingredients. You would be able to find \\"Roast Duck Nachos\\", under any of these headings.<br /><br />All in all, not only is this a good cookbook, but a good history into some of the world's finest chinatowns.	2005-01-31

For several years now I've been placing my order with Cabot Farms or Grafton village for some of their wonderful, aged, Vermont white cheddar cheese.  Wisconsin not withstanding, I am convinced that the finest cheddar cheeses in the world come from Vermont, not to mention the fact that they are found in some of the most gorgeous settings to be found anywhere.  You can't help but picture New England on a snowy winter's day.<br /><br />That's why this book was such a great read.  I was already familiar with many of the Farms mentioned by Mr. Tewksbury, having visited many of their websites in the past, but I certainly found some new places I was not aware of.  Learning about Vermont's cheesemakers and the products they lovingly craft makes eating them all the more enjoyable. Tewksbury tells us where and how each artisan makes cheese, which operations welcome visitors, and where to purchases the cheeses.<br /><br />Thank God for the Internet because no matter where you live you can have these wonderful products of Vermont sent right to your doorstep.	2005-01-31

Mom, dad, Grandma, etc, all take turns giving baby an number of kisses.  Cute, cartoon-like illustrations with rich colors and shapes will catch your little one's eye.  The kissing helps start them on the way with their counting as well.  It's such a sweet, little book.  Whether a kissing routine works for you or not, you'll definitely want to add this book to your list of books for story time before bed.  Truly another winner from Karen Katz.	2005-01-28

Scripted by Roger Stern and with art by the ever reliable John Buscema and Tom Palmer, the Masters of Evil led by Baron Zemo actually manage to defeat the Avengers and take over the Avengers mansion itself.  The Team at that time was a relatively weaker group that included Captain America, the Wasp, the Black Knight, Hercules, and Captain Marvel II (the black female version) with Thor as an occasional guest star.<br /><br />The Masters of Evil were always a fun group of villians.  Really a throwback to 1960's silver-age era baddies.  Bad but not exactly evil per se.  They hust always seemed to have a jones-on for the Avengers.  A fun storyline with out having the endless plot threads that infect so many modern day comics.  Good read and solid if unspectacular art.	2005-01-27

When the pair teamed up on a run of Avengers from #89 to #97, they created one of the most legendary stories in Avenger's history that continues to be powerful more than 30 years later.<br /><br />At the start of the story we learn about the alien races of the Kree and Skrulls.  The Kree are a paternalistic, arrogant race of highly advanced beings who jump-started the early men who would become the Inhumans and now consider Earth to be a threat to their dominance.  The Skrulls are a race of shape-shifters  who receive far less respect than the Kree, although they`re really no more evil. The two races hate one another, and each is now under the leadership of an usurper who urges war.<br /><br />Earth finds itself in the wrong place caught in the middle between the two warring races.  And the Avengers are taken to the Andromeda galaxy where they aid their ally, the Kree-born Captain Marvel.  This ends up being a story well ahead of it's time.  By the time the late 1980's and 90's came around these kind of multi-issue, cosmic reaching storylines were all the norm with thigs like Secret Wars, Infinty Gauntlet, and countless others, but this story took place back in 1971 and 1972.  The run would display some classic Neal Adams Covers including #96 with the Vision pummelling an alien nearly to death.<br /><br />While a bit dated today, particularly in regard to the overly dramatic speech of the characters, it nevertheless was a complex storyline that foreshadowed many storylines 20 years down the road and remains a classic.	2005-01-27

I've never really been one who likes these huge, mega-recipe cookbooks as I've always preferred smaller, more specialized books.  This one did come as a surprise as a friend loaned it to me who just raved about it.  The recipes are culled from the pages of Cooks Illustrated Magazine which I am not overly familiar with.  With a 1000 pages and 1000 recipes, you're sure to find a LOT that you can use.<br /><br />One thing important to note is that these recipes are not simply thrown into the book.  Cooks Illustrated tests these receipes in their kitches many times, evaluating all facets of the recipe from ingredients and preparation to cook times and equipment.  More than just recipes, the book acts as a guide to everyday kitchen techniques, many designed for the novice but certainly still valuable to more experienced cooks.  There's also great advice on buying cookware and utensils, as often your receipes are only as good as the equipment you use to make them.<br /><br />Everything from simple casserole dishes and crockpot favorites to more elegant receipes can be found within its pages.  The receipes are VERY step-by-step, obviously written for the beginner in mind and will ensure a great meal everytime.  Add to that the editors have put in a generous helping of over 800 illustrations perfectly complement the well-written and well-tested recipes.<br /><br />If you are going to own just one of these massive type cook books...toss out Betty Crocker...Give the Joy of Cooking the heave-ho...let the Gourmet Cookbook gather dust, and pickup this fantastic book.  Simply put it's the best of its kind anywhere!  Highest recommendation.	2005-01-26

But Steve Raichlen is the true expert...the man whose skill and knowledge not only of BBQ techniques, but of choosing the right equipment, spices, sauces, etc, is second to none in the BBQ realm.  Steve has authored the BBQ Bible, and Indoor Grilling among other great books and here's another one designed for novices or experts.<br /><br />Liberally blessed with over 1000 glossy photos, this book will provide step-by-step techniques to make you an expert griller.  From choosing your grill to utensils.  Whether its an expensive gas grill, cheap charcoal grill, water smoker, or rotisserie, Steven gives you the skinny on everything.<br /><br />There are sections on how to grill pork including delectable, melt-in-your-mouth pulled pork for sandwiches, Ribs, whole pigs, tenderloins, and chops.  Or there is the Beef section detailing techniques from doing prime rib or a whole brisket, right down to making the best burgers.  There's also sections of poultry, seafood, veggies, sauces and rubs.  The Salmon receipes are just to die for and I'm not even a big fan of seafood generally.  FAntastic burgers, even recipes to make your own turkey pastrami.  Wow!<br /><br />Written simply and geared more towards beginning grillers, it's still sophisticated enough to provide some extremely elegant techniques and recipes.  While Steve seems to prefer an old fashioned charcoal grill, he still realizes that Gas grills are the preference today and provides all the tips you need to get that great grill taste from any kind of grill you use.  It's the dead of winter with a foot of snow on the ground and I am licking my chops in anticipation of firing up the grill and making some more great recipes!<br /><br />Thanks again, Steve!	2005-01-26

Private Investigator John Taylor, with a psychic/magical gift to be able to find anyone or anything, is living in London, having left the Nightside five years ago, determined never to return.  A wealthy woman named Joanna shows up at his office requesting Taylor to find her runaway daughter Cathy.  She claims that she has runaway to the Nightside.  The Nightside...where it is always 3 AM...always dark and always deadly.<br /><br />Taylor is reluctant to return to that dark world within a world where magic works and all manner of creatures mingle side-by-side, but then Joanna makes him an offer he simply cannot refuse.  Taylor returns to the Nightside accompanied by Joanna but soon finds that his gift only provides a brief glimpse of the girl then he is shut out.  Someone or something is keeping the girl hidden from him.

I picked up my first copy of martin and Porters video guides probably close to 20 years ago when the video boom was really taking off.  They never featured as many films in their guides as other people, Like Maltin for example, but they generally gave more comprehensive reviews and didn't disregard B movies as many other reviewers did.  Through their guides I discovered many wonderful films over the years and generally bought their new guide at least every other year if not every year.<br /><br />Their guides have always been well organized with thorough indexes to find films and stars.  Over the years they've continued to add more and more films to an ever growing impressive list of films.  The only problem is, and its with any film guide, but in this day and age where there are SO many websites with both amateur and professional film reviews, it's really made books almost obsolete.  Even putting out a new guide every year they are still going to lag behind websites which have reviews posted upon release.<br /><br />If you absolutely want a hard copy guide then this IS the one to buy.	2005-01-25

It teaches children about counting as the caterpillar slowly eats his way through multitudes of different foods.  It teaches the days of the week, as each day passes and the caterpillar eats more and more...It can teach colors as each food is easily identified by it's colors such as the bright red apple.  And it even teaches some beginning science as we see the caterpillar hatch from an egg...then build his cocoon, and emerge a beautiful little butterfly.<br /><br />Carle spins this tale in a manner so easy for pre-K kids to understand and follow along with perfectly simple and colorful illustrations to complement the text.  This book is one of my 2 year olds true favorites to read at story time.  It's been around for quite awhile but this book is always a winner.  All of Carle's books are highly recommended!	2005-01-25

He probably had at least a dozen of them.  I'm so glad we never threw them out because now we have a 2 1/2 year old who will be able to enjoy them all over again.  Mercer Mayers humorous and cartoony style of illustration is the kind of quality you'd see in the Sunday Funnies.  The expressions of the characters are done with a cartoonist's hand, as opposed to an illustrator's.<br /><br />In this book, Little sister is bored stiff because its raining out and she cannot go out to play.  She is bored in her room and goes to play in her brother's room instead, even though he has the same toys.  She tries to help mom with the housework but wakes the baby...Gosh!  haven't we all had to deal with entertaining our kids when they cannot go out to play?  Mayer nails it right on the head.<br /><br />Just a wonderful book for kids and parents.	2005-01-25

Sneaking around, the Gorilla uses the keys to open up the cages of other animals.  They form a parade behind the unwitting watchman, even following him home and into bed for the night until the watchman's wife notices and leads the animals back to their rightful beds for the night.<br /><br />Kids will laugh as the gorilla and other animals sneak around right behind the watchman's back.  Peggy Rathman's funny, cartoon-like illustrations are the perfect complement to her text.  This one has quickly become a new favorite in our household with my two year old.	2005-01-25

Just as him, he will tell you so.  I remember when I first read this book many years ago.  i got the first three in the series when I joined the Sci-Fi book club.  I thought i was in for a grand epic fantasy.  Boy was I wrong.  I made it through the first two books but that's as far as i could get through this tedious display of fantasy self-gratification.  Goodkind has evidently decided to race Robert Jordan to see who can put out the most books in a series that tired long ago.<br /><br />Wizard's first Rule presents nothing original, which in an of itself is no crime.  Nothing wrong with borrowing a basic plot of simple guy who's prophesized to become the hero by questing for and wielding the powerful artifact and destroying the evil bad guy...We've seen the plot done many, many times.  But never has it been done so dreadfully, painfully boring as in Goodkind's story.  The biggest drawback to the series for me is that I just didn't like either of the main characters, Richard or Kahlan.  I found nothing about them that made me care about them or their quest.  His world of the Midlands was as bland as his characters and seemed lifeless.<br /><br />I cannot imagine having stayed with this series for six more books.  I'd be willing to give Goodkind another try if he started a new project but as it is now, he seems more interested in cashing his royalty checks than making anything original.	2005-01-21

Along the way she encouters other animals such as seals, whales, and a walrus, all sleeping and dreaming the night away.<br /><br />The Illustrations by Stephen Savage perfectly compliment lauren Thompson's prose with colors that match the mood and setting perfectly, including the glow when the cub sees a meteor shower.

I was totally blown away as it was one of the best fantasy books I've read in quite a long time.  But calling it a fantasy doesn't do it justice.  This great book has elements of dark fantasy, horror, sci-fi, mixed with a little mystery and a generous sprinkling of humor.  Now that may sound like the book wants to be all things to all people but the elements work very well.<br /><br />The Nightside is a kind of alternate world buried deep in the heart of london.  A place much bigger that the supposed one square mile it rests on.  It's always 3 am in Nightside.  That's how the denizens like it.  A place where everyday people mix with creatures of myth and legend.  Vampires, ghosts, ghouls, sorcerers, demons, and things far more terrible can be found living in Nightside.  There are many unique being in the Nightside such as Jennifer Sorrow, Razor Eddie, The Collector and others.  Watching over the Nightside is the Authorities.  Mysterious beings of great power who police...loosely...the Nightside.<br /><br />John Taylor is one of them.  A private investigator who has a special gift for finding things.  John can find virtually anything or anyone with a magical/psychic talent.  Jack is contracted by the Vatican itself to retrieve a powerful artifact--The Unholy Grail--the cup that Judas drank from at the Last Supper.  And artifact so evil and powerful that it could bring armageddon to the world.  But The VAtican is not the only ones searching for the grail.  All the great powers in the Nightside want it.<br /><br />Add to all of these great powers who want the Grail, so does heaven and hell.  They both send legions of angels into the Nightside which even the Authorities cannot stand up against.  Without much subtlety the angels begin killing anyone who dares get in their path.  Because John Taylors unique power makes the angels aware of his presence and make him vulnerable, he decides to use old-fashioned footwork to find the grail, enlisting the aid of old friend Shotgun Suzie to help.  John and Suzie quickly find themselves caught squarely in the middle of a battle between all of Nighsides great powers along with Angels from above and below.  And just under the surface of all this is the mystery of Jack's mother who NO ONE wants to talk about and the only thing that causes Jack to be unable to control his emotions over.<br /><br />This is just a terrific book.  Green creates some of the most fascinating creatures of power you'll ever meet.  Razor Eddie is a skinny, pale, smelling of death power who uses an ivory handled razor to dispatch anyone in his way.  Then there is Alex Morrissey, owner of Strangefellows, the oldest bar in the world whose Ancestor is the Great mage Merlin.<br /><br />Witty and darkly humorous, with doses of dialog brimming with sarcasm, Green creates fantastic, more-than-human characters who have distinctly human frailties.  In Nightside, he's manifested a wonderful yet terrible place that you'd want to visit but never want to live there.<br /><br />This is one of three Nightside novels with a fourth due out soon.  I'm into the second one already and loving it just as much.

The last 70 years have not been kind to King Kong.  \\"Son of Kong\\" was a hastily produced sequel that came out the same year as the original.  While not bad, it lacked the impact of the original.  Still, \\"Son of Kong\\" is vastly superior to what we've been subject to since then.  The 1960's brought us the Japanese-made \\"King Kong vs. Godzilla\\" and \\"King Kong Escapes.\\"  Kong suddenly is grown to Godzilla's height to do battle and played by a guy in a horrible looking monkey suit.<br /><br />The 1970's were not any better.  In 1976, producer Dino De Laurentiis gave us a big budget remake that was universally panned by critics.  Incredibly, despite the re-make flopping, a sequel, \\"King Kong Lives\\" hit theatres ten years later in 1986 with Kong somehow surviving his fall from the World Trade Center and now in a coma and need of a heart transplant.  Uggh!<br /><br />But finally, King Kong fans have something to cheer about.  Kong: King of Skull Island is a new and original novel from Dark Horse Press, created and beautifully illustrated by artist Joe DeVito.  The book has been officially authorized by the estate of Merian C. Cooper, King Kong's creator.  The book performs as both a sequel to the 1933 classic and a prequel.<br /><br />Carl Denham, the man who brought King Kong to New York, and was held responsible for his destructive rampage, disappeared soon after Kong's death and has not been seen for 25 years.  His son Vincent Denham, who had always doubted the stories about Kong decides to set out on a quest to discover the truth about both King Kong and his missing father.  He enlists the aid of Jack Driscoll, the character played in the original film by Bruce Cabot, to take him to the legendary Skull Island.<br /><br />While going ashore Vincent and several crew members are attacked by the great beasts that live under the depths and he is nearly killed.  He's taken in and cared for by the island's natives and meets an ancient looking woman known only as \\"The Storyteller.\\"  The Storytellers are the keepers of knowledge and lore and while nursing Vincent back to health, she begins telling him the stories of how her people first came to the island ages ago.<br /><br />She tells them how her people, through the use of rare plants and herbs were actually able to control the great beasts who lived on the island including the great apes known as \\"kongs.\\"  Through her stories we learn of the division in her ancestors,  the origin of  the great wall, and of the early life of King Kong.  Vincent also learns how his father's actions of 25 years earlier affected the natives and why a native named Kara holds such hatred for Vincent and his long lost father.<br /><br />Joe DeVito and Brad Strickland have crafted a powerful and well-thought out story that gives a richness to the background of Kong and Skull Island that we never had before.

She tells them how her people, through the use of rare plants and herbs were actually able to control the great beasts who lived on the island including the great apes known as \\"kongs.\\"  Through her stories we learn of the division in her ancestors,  the origin of  the great wall, and of the early life of King Kong.

The Orb has been stolen by a priest of the mad god Torak and he intends to use it to wake that god from his unending sleep to dominate the world.<br /><br />The group is also joined by several new members including Hettar who can speak to horses, Princess CeNedra, who flees from her home, and Mandorellan a powerful and chivalrous knight.  Also in the book we begin to learn more about Garion and that he is also fated to be a powerful wizard like his Grandfather Belgarath and Aunt Polgara.  And he must learn to start controlling his powers.<br /><br />Once again Eddings' masterful character development set this apart from other fantasy writers.  He creates unique characters with distinct abilities, mannerisms, and personalities and they never come off as cookie cutter or cliched.  Eddings is at his best while describing the races of his world such as the plotting Murgos and Nyissians.<br /><br />It's been well over 20 years since I read this book but I still recall them fondly and remember the anxious wait for the next one in the series to come out.

He's 13 years old now and doesn't read these anymore but I confess to picking one up still here and there.  I've been a fan of fantasy literature for 30 years and sometimes it's nice to take a bit of a break from the latest Robert Jordan behemoth and read something a little lighter both in length and in plot.<br /><br />This is #32 in mary Pope Osbornes wonderfully imaginative Magic Tree House series.  In this one, during Christmas Time Jack and Annie are summoned through the tree house by old friends Teddy and Kathleen.  They emerge in a land that is frozen by magic by the Ice Wizard.  But the wizard is no villian.  He actually wanted Jack and Annie's help in finding Merlin and Morgan Le Fay who have disappeared.  Thus begins a typical classic fantasy quest for our heroes.<br /><br />Most adults can get through one of these in a couple of hours or so and kids in a couple of days.

The fact that the characters preparing to go to bed by taking baths, brushing their teeth and getting into their pajamas are funny animals, makes it so much more entertaining for little ones.

To think that 35 years later this wonderful book about the imagination of a child is still a top seller is amazing.

Written mainly by Bill Finger who NEVER got the credit he deserved and died poor and art by Bob Kane, Jerry Robinson, Dick Sprang, George Roussos, Jack Burnley and others.  It includes stories from Batman issues: #7, 15, 20, 31, 37, 47, 48, 49, Detective Comics #27, 33, 38, 49, 80, Real FAct Comics #5, Star Spangled Comics #70, and World's Finest Comics #30.  17 stories in all.<br /><br />You'll see the first appearance of Batman, Robin, the Joker, Catwoman, Two-Face, and other notables.  One notable exclusion is the first appearance of Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne's longt-ime butler.<br /><br />Those unfamiliar with comics in the 1940's may be somewhat put off by the more simplistic art of the era, but this is really the essence of Batman, a very dark character who actually once used handguns among his various weapons.  But the fact is that unless you are quite wealthy the only way you'll ever see these great old stories are in collected volumes like this and I think DC deserves a lot of credit for not letting the golden age fade away.	2005-01-13

I've always looked at Emeril as an entertainer first as opposed to a chef whose receipes I'm going to run out tomorrow and try to make.  While the title of this book may lead to the belief that these these may be recipes related to those things that camein aluminum tins.  The TV refers to his TV show as he presents 150 recipes from his year on the Food network.<br /><br />There are some very exotic dishes to be found in the pages of this book.  Things like Creole Spiced Blue Crabs with Green Onion Dipping Sauce and Rock Shrimp Stuffed Flounder,or Emeril's Potato Truffle Charlotte.  From Fall River, MA to New Orleans you get 150 classic recipes.  Whether its Cajun or dishes inspired by his Portugese heritage, there's quite a diversified set of recipes to be found here, all with Emerils enjoyable way of presenting them in a fun an entertaining way.<br /><br />Honestly I will never make most of these dishes.

Every few years they decide to make national headlines by killing off a major character and boost sales.  Now of course, DC NEVER wanted people to know that the Robin that was killed was NOT the original Dick Grayson character but rather the second Robin Jason Todd (who?) and what's more they left his fate up to a vote by fans via a 900 number.  That shows you hoe popular Jason Todd was.<br /><br />DC got what they wanted.  I was working part-time in a comic store and I remember vividly the all-out frenzy there was over the original issues.  We limited one per customer and I never saw so many parents in the store to buy that ONE issue as moms and dads took separate places in line to get this \\"collectible\\".<br /><br />The Story was written by Jim Starlin who is an excellent writer but seems so much better with the more cosmic storylines people know him so well for rather than a gritty Batman story.  Jim Aparo's art, while capable really is old style 1970's all the way.  Aparo was an excellent artist in the 1970's but simply could not compete with guys like McFarlane and others in the 80's.<br /><br />Jason gets mixed up with the Joker who is granted citizenship by Iraq!  later gets beaten by the Joker with a crowbar and then blown up.  Well of course it would be not long before Batman would take Tim Drake as the third Robin and Jason would become a mere footnote.

Rather than fitting in stories to the TV chronology, this 4 part story art actually takes place BEFORE the TV series starts and AFTER the events of the original film.<br /><br />Buffy had just burned down the school gym and unable to cope with being the Slayer she flees to Las Vegas along with friend Pike, the character Luke Perry played in the movie.  They get jobs in a casino that just happens to be run by a couple of vamps.  Angel is on the scene too although Buffy is never aware of it so no continuity is screwed up.  The art team of Cliff Richards and Will Conrad could have gotten away with all sorts of sleaze since the story takes place in Vegas. Instead, while they show Buffy suffering for her art in a bustier, hot pants and nylons, none of the artwork looks exploitive. She looks instead as seriously out of place in that outfit as she should.<br /><br />In the end, Pike realize his place is not with Buffy and leaves Buffy alone where she would eventually go home and then move to Sunnydale.

With the help of a  alchemist/plastic surgeon, Selke is given daily treatments to restore her beauty but also finds a special blood source that makes vampires stronger than ever. Selve proceeds to lead a small army of super-vamps who threaten the Slayer as well as the average vamps.  This eventually leads to all out war between the two factions of Vamps with Buffy and Angel caught in the middle.<br /><br />It's a solid storyline.  Watson clearly has a good grasp of the various characters and their mannerisms, speech, befavior, etc, and they fit along very well with their TV counterparts.  Nothing here in anyway would upset or contrast with the continuity of the TV show.  Cliff Richards' art is very strong and he does a great job of making the characters look true to life, not always easy to do for a comic artist.	2005-01-11

Each decade has its own section: 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, and 90's and provides dated strips so you know exactly which day and year they came from.<br /><br />It's interesting to see the development of the characters from the almost toddler like characters in the early 50s to the children that were most familiar with today.  The strips cover so much including Charlie's stress over the holidays, helping little sister Sally write letters to Santa, decorating, being good, presents, and the whole 9 yards.<br /><br />While hardly comprehensive it does provide a nice sampling and I always loved reading Peanuts around Christmastime especially.  Probably the best sections are the 1960's and early 70's when Schulz was really at the top of his game.  Find one if you can!	2005-01-07

Well, it must be Conan O'Brian because it certainlt isn't Conan the Barbarian.  How could anyone who ever READ and any of Robert E. Howard's works ever come up with such a mess as this.  I was quite excited about it as the Sack of Vanarium is the first significant event that Robert E. Howard ever mentions about the 16 year old Conan but never put it into story.  I would have preferred that it wasn't now.  Of course this concerns Aquilonia, the most powerful kingdom of the Hyborian world, expanding its borders deep into the northen lands and into Conan's home of Cimmeria, and of the subsequent destruction of Venarium outpost by the Cimmerians.<br /><br />Poorly developed characters including Conan's mother not to mention most of the Cimmerians who come off as more like brutish stupid Picts than the powerful, yet clever warriors they were.  And since when do Cimmerians live in towns???  There were tribesman.  Nomadic Tribesman who lived more along the lines of native Americans in animal skinned or wood huts or even caves...but not in structures that Turtledove describes.<br /><br />The action scenes are poorly paced and boring, the characters are boring, and Conan comes off in his youth as a sniveling momma's boy.

I think as a married, family man myself now for the past 15 years is what drew me (no pun intended) to Lynn Johnston's wonderful strip about life, love, and family.<br /><br />This book is a 25 year retrospective of the fantastic characters Lynn has created as we see them grow and mature over that time.  Suddenly Silver is divided into three sections that reflect the strip's early, middle, and recent years.  Throughout the book, Lynn Johnston offers readers anecdotal musings and comments on her real life, and how it is reflected in her character's growth and family evolution. Blended with Johnston's family's own response to what it was like growing up in a cartoon strip, this makes for a truly sweet journey.<br /><br />Lynn is one BIG reason why I am such a fan of comic strips.

In fact, this is the only time of the year that I read some strips as long as they have a Christmas subject.  This 160 page collection gathers many, but certainly not all of the Peanuts Christmas strips done by Schulz from the 50's through the 90's.  You'll see the gang decorating, having fun, and going through the general stress of Christmas as themes of commercialism are explored as they were in the classic TV special.<br /><br />Yes, I don't think there are any strips here that have NOT been re-printed in previous collections so if you are a real Peanuts \\"nut\\", chances are you've seen these before.  But, they've never been presented in a Christmas themed collection before as far as I know so that makes it a nice book to own.<br /><br />Simply delightful	2005-01-06

I would also consider this to be Howard's most complex character.  While characters like Conan, Kull, El-Borak, could almost be considered reincarnations of the same character, Kane is most unique.  He's not a man driven to a life of adventure for the love of it or for monetary gain, but rather it is his zealous quest to bring justice and the Lord's retribution down upon those who commit evil.<br /><br />Also, Kane is quite different physically than Howards other characters.  He's no muscle-bound behemoth, but tall, rather gaunt by comparison, but still strong of arm and sword and also armed with musket and pistol.<br /><br />These stories, set in the 16th century are pure an unedited versions of the original Howard stories and as such, do contain rather strong racial stereotypes, particularly of blacks.  The stories are also among Howard's most atmospheric.  One wonders how a man who rarely left his home of Cross Plains, Texas could so vividly describe, and capture the feel of darkest Africa.<br /><br />Among the best stories in the collection are:<br /><br />\\"Red Shadows\\" This was REH's first published Solomon Kane story.  Kane finds a young girl, raped and beaten by a gang of brigands led by the villainous Le Loup.  When the girl dies in his arms, Kane grimly declares to seek revenge. He devotes the next few years to making life a living hell for Le Loup and his comrades, finally killing them in the French mountains.  Le Loup alone narrowly escapes, but with Kane on his trail, a trail which leads them both into deepest, darkest Africa.  Here they meet again, but Le Loup has enlisted the support of a tribal chief.  In turn, Kane gains the support of the village witch doctor named N'Longa, and together they see that justice is done.<br /><br />\\"The Hills of the Dead\\"  Declaring Kane his \\"blood-brother\\", N'Longa the witch-doctor gives Kane a magic wooden staff, which will protect him in his travels.  Kane finds himself impulsively drawn to the jungle and soon his travels lead to a city of vampires!  But not to worry; his magic staffproves a suitable match for the loathsome creatures.  Just the same, he finds there are too many of them for him to handle alone and so, going into a trance, he contacts N'Longa, who is able to join Kane in spirit by sending his soul to inhabit the borrowed body of a local native.  Together they track down the vampires' home and exterminate them all.<br /><br />\\"The Footfalls Within\\"  Kane comes across Arab slave-traders driving their slaves to market.  A young girl falls, exhausted, and the slavers decide to amuse themselves by skinning her alive.  Kane rushes to her rescue but is overwhelmed and taken prisoner A short while later, both slavers and slaves happen upon an ancient and very spooky mausoleum.  Though they sense evil about the place, the lead slaver decides to break open the thing, intendiing to divest it of whatever riches may have been buried there with its dead.  But Kane hears scary, elephantine footfalls from within, as of some giant THING pacing back and forth. This was a very strong Kane tale, really more horrific than most and Howard does a fantastic job of building up tension.<br /><br />Those may be my favorites but this collection, brilliantly illustrated by Gary Gianni is fantastic from cover-to-cover.

Books	5	57	63	N	N	The Story of WCW's Amazing Rise & Fall	I've been reading Bryan Alvarez' column now for quite some time and he is one of the most respected people covering pro wrestling today.  Along with R.D. Reynolds they tell the story of the remarkable Rise & Fall and eventual Death of WCW.  Relive some of the classic moments as WCW began its increidble rise from a second rate wrestling company who once gave us Robocop in the ring, to the juggernaut that nearly did the unthinkable: Nearly putting Vince McMahon and the WWF out of business.<br /><br />Through interviews with many of the stars and other participants we'll see how WCW used the WWFs long-time strategy of raiding its rivals talent rosters as they systematically stole nearly every major star that the WWF had in the 80's and early 90's: Hogan, Savage, Nash, SCott Hall, Bret Hart, Ted DiBiase, Sean Waltman, the Nasty Boys, Ultimate Warrior, and more.  The eventual \\"turning\\" of Hulk Hogan and the creation of the NWO led to WCW winning the Monday Night ratings war with the WWF for over 80 consecutive weeks.<br /><br />Riding high, WCW will soon collapse under its own weight.  Soon, big, guaranteed contracts given to wrestlers take their toll on WCWs budget as guys like Nash, Hogan, Hall, and Hart would be injured for months at a time.  WCW leaked money like a sieve, tossing about millions to bring in celebrities like Dennis Rodman, Jay Leno, and Karl Malone, and trying to make wrestlers out of people like Jerry Only of the Misfits.<br /><br />Meanwhile egos clashed as the powerbrokers like Bischoff, Hogan, and Nash controlled everything and kept younger wrestlers down.  Fights backstage and no advancement would eventually lead many younger stars like Chris jehrico, Chris Benoit, and Eddie Guerrero to jump ship to the WWF.<br /><br />Small cracks became large fissures.  WCW brings in Vince Russo to do the booking leading to some of the greatest embarrassments in the history of wrestling with Hogan lying down on the mat to lose and actor DAvid Arquette becoming WCW champion.  Add to that, WCW could find no answer to the WWF's two hugely popular stars: Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock.<br /><br />It would all lead to a company that was once worthy tens of millions being bought by Vince McMahon for a fraction of that and opening up the last Nitro show announcing the purchase of WCW.<br /><br />Many of these details are quite well known but the interviews are great and its amazing the way even years later some of the parties involved still refuse to accept any blame for WCWs downfall.  Excellent Read!coming WCW champion.

Howard has ever written, from Conan, Kull, Kane, and Bran Mak Morn to Kirby O'Donnell, El Borak, Sailor Steve Costigan, Pike Bearfield and most of his other weird menace, horror, boxing, and adventure stories in the middle.  But I never tire of reading them again, especially when they are in handsome, lavishly illustrated editions such as the Bloody Crown of Conan.  The book contains only three Conan stories but they are among the longest and best.<br /><br />\\"A Witch Shall Be Born\\" written in 1934 contains among the most powerful images in all of Conan Lore as Conan is crucified in the desert and left to the pickings of the vultures.  It is among the most vivid testaments to his strength and fortitude to have survived where any other man would perish.<br /><br />\\"The Hour of the Dragon\\" was Howard's longest Conan tale and the only true Conan novel that REH ever wrote.  Having just become King of Aquilonia, intrigue from neighboring Nemedia where the exiled Valerius had fled, results in the ressurection of one of Acheron's most powerful wizards Xaltotun, dead for some 3,000 years.<br /><br />Conan is deposed from the throne and tossed into the dungeons to rot but is saved by a salve named Zenobia, who Conan would later re-pay by making her his wife and Queen.  Conan then goes on a quest to find the Heart of Ahriman, the one item that can destroy the wizard.  A truly epic Conan story and one where he must admit that his sword cannot win the day without help.  Some make undue comparisons to Tolkien but Hour of the Dragon was written LONG before Lord of the Rings and there's no evidence that Howard was even aware of Tolkien.<br /><br />The last story is another Classic, The People of the Black Circle.  the plot involves a group of wizards on Mount Yimsha who  kidnap the Devi Yasmina to their mountain stronghold.  Conan must join up with another ruffian and rescue her.  While all the characters are remarkably multifaceted, I particularly liked Khemsa, a novice wizard who is talked into rising above his station (and defying his masters) by his beautiful, scheming girlfriend.<br /><br />Best of all these tales are not the edited versions you may have read in the old Ace and Berkely paperbacks, but pure, unedited Howard.  Great stuff!tifaceted, I particularly liked Khemsa, a novice wizard who is talked into rising above his station (and defying his masters) by his beautiful, scheming girlfriend. <br /> <br />Best of all these tales are not the edited versions you may have read in the old Ace and Berkely paperbacks, but pure, unedited Howard.

Books	5	3	4	N	N	FINALLY PURE HOWARD CONAN STORIES	Like many Conan fans, I first read the stories of Conan back in the 1970's through the old ACE paperback collections.  It wasn't until many years later that i would find that these stories were edited, sometimes quite heavily, and also finished or collaborated on posthumously by people like Lin Carter and L. Sprague DeCamp.  While Carter certainly thrived in the genre of Swords and Sorcery, DeCamp could barely contain his disdain for the genre or Robert E. Howard for that matter and it certainly shows when stories are compared side-by-side.  For all Howard's critics labelinig him as a pulp hack, DeCamp WISHES he would have had Howard's skill for prose and action.<br /><br />This book presents 13 of Howard's Conan stories in the order they were written, although NOT chronologically, so don't get confused.  The stories are the pure an unedited versions, many for the first time since they were published in the pages of Weird Tales over seventy years ago.<br /><br />Among the stories in the Collection are:<br /><br />The Queen of the Black Coast - One of the longer tales that Howard wrote as Conan meets with his first true love Belit in a jungle adventure.<br /><br />The Frost Giants Daughter - where Conan encounters A Beautiful snow Queen and the Frost Giants in the frigid northern Lands.<br /><br />The Tower of the Elephant - Classic howard with a young Conan as a thief with a nod to Lovecraft's dark Cthulhu gods.<br /><br />The book is illustrated by Mark Schultz who does a fine job but certainly no Frazetta or even Boris for that matter.  For any Conan fan this is a definitive book to get the stories as they were originally written and intended and unsoiled by the less skilled writers who would edit them in later decades.<br /><br />highly recommended	2005-01-04

Not always literally, mind you.  But it's one of those books you can just pickup...flip to any part and just begin reading when you have a few spare moments.  If you're interested in the history of science at all, this is one of the most enjoyable books on the subject that I have ever read. Bill Bryson's history and science is solid, covering both the history of scientific endeavor and discoveries, and the often quite bizarre folks who were involved in those discoveries.<br /><br />Learn about relatively unknown men like Thomas Midgley, the man who essentially invented chloroflourocarbons, or CFCs.  This went onto make appliances such as refrigerators much safer to use than the old ones which often used dangerous gases.<br /><br />Or Clair Peterson who discovered the age of the Planet Earth in 1953 by making a study of meteors...<br /><br />Bryson isn't a scientist, he's a writer, but he clearly did his homework over the course of the three years he took to put this book together. The writing is clear, entertaining, and never slips into industry jargon - if anything, Bryson underestimates the reader and explains some concepts a little more than he needs to. And this book is funny. I can't remember the last time I ever laughed so much reading a book about science.<br /><br />Very enjoyable book!	2005-01-04

The mere consideration of that is utterly ridiculous and evidence of the arrogance of Mr. McKiernan.  Thankfully the Tolkien estate, knowing that a sequel was a dumb idea but perhaps knowing, too, that Mr. McKiernan was a hack, told him to forget it.<br /><br />Thus...we got the Iron Tower Trilogy.  A version of the Lord of the Rings told as if someone were relating a very condensed version of the story that they heard one night in a drunken stuppor sitting over a campfire and roasting marshmallows.<br /><br />As if totally thumbing his nose at the Tolkien estate, McKiernan barely tried to hide the fact that he was lifting the story nearly idea for idea.  Warrows who replace Hobbits have names EXACTLY in the Tolkien style such as the main character Tuck Underbuck.  And then there are Ruhks which replace Orcs, Hloks which replace Urak Hais, Ghuls that replace Nazgul, Gyphon replaces Morgoth...and well...you see what I mean.  Virtually every major LOtR's character and idea has been McKiernan-ized.<br /><br />As with his other books set in this realm, the various races of the world all have different names for the same places or creatures leading to mass confusion on the part of the reader.  Add to that McKiernan's extremely clumsy prose, terrible pacing and lack of character development, and you get one huge mess of a story.<br /><br />While this was McKiernan's first major book, his latter novels such as the Hel Fire Duology all suffer from the same weaknesses.  For the life of me I cannot figure out why he seems to have such a legion of fans but I guess we all have our own tastes.	2005-01-04

I can remember going to Montgomery Wards with my mom and she buying me a new one every couple of weeks or so.  But little did I ever see of the peanuts figures contained in this, the second volume of the Complete Peanuts, covering 1953 - 1954.<br /><br />You get over 700 of Charles Schultz' daily and Sunday strips, over half of which have never been re-printed in any previous collection.  These peanuts still have yet to take on the familiar look and characteristics that we would come to know in the 1960's.  They are more crudely drawn..looking more like toddlers really.  They are also louder and rowdier than you remember, often times being downright nasty to the other characters.  Quite surprising for me since I've never seen any of these older strips before.<br /><br />Linus and Snoopy get a bit more strip time than in the first collection and Lucy begins becoming the domineering, bossy sister that we know and love.  Pig Pen is introduced along with Charlotte Braun who disappeared just as quickly.  Also, interestingly, we see perhaps the only strips (that i know of anyway) where Schultz actually draws adult characters.<br /><br />The collections looks great too.  Very sharp reproductions on strips which haven't seen the light of day in 50 years.  An Amazing collection and another must add to your bookshelf.	2005-01-04

Just curious.  I'd love to see those.  Well this Essential volume collects Caps Earliest Silver Age Adventures from Tales of Suspense #55 - 99 and Captain America 100 - 102 once the title was changed.<br /><br />While we were now in the mid-1960's, many of these stories were still fought against Nazi enemies like the Red Skull, Baron Zemo, and the Sleepers.  The stories are all Stan Lee.  Jack Kirby does the art on the early issues but later we have art by George Tuska (ugghhh) and John Romita (yay!).<br /><br />Tales of Suspense 78 introduced Nick Fury as a pal of Cap's.  #'s 82 - 84 introduced the android menace of the Super Adaptoid who could mimick the powers and abilities of any hero.  # 93 and 94 featured the first appearance of the AIM created cyborg called MODOK.  Truly one of the more bizarre villians of the 1960's.  Leading into the title Change to Captain America issues 101 & 102 again feature the Red Skull and his evil Sleeper Robots.<br /><br />One may say this collection is a bit too heavy with the Red Skull as he appears in 16 of the stories.  I'd say that's true but what are you going to do?  That was Cap's arch-nemesis at the time.  If you're going to reprint the stories chronologically, you have to take the good with the bad.  Not that it's bad, but one wishes that Jack and Stan had been  perhaps a bit more creative with one of their oldest characters.<br /><br />Nothing in the Essential Captain America is ground-breaking.  It's good silver age fun though.	2004-12-29

Maybe it's because Rachael is so fun and effervescent, but I love watching her. She brings such energy and enthusiasm to cooking that is sorely lacking in many TV cooks.  The other thing is that Rachael is a \\"food\\" person and not a chef.  She first and foremost enjoys tastes and ease of cooking over making something look ready to be photographed for the cover of Gourmet magazine.<br /><br />The fact is most of us don't have the time to put sprigs of parsley and ribbon slice veggies for garnish on our meals.  We are busy, on the go people with kids ang jobs and all sorts of things to do.  Rachaels books are for us!  Easy, quick meals that you can probably make with ingredients you already have in your pantry and don't require trips to gourmet food stores to find.  yes, it's true that most of the meals are going to take a bit more than 30 minutes to finish but even getting Dinner prepped and cook in an hour is nice.<br /><br />Rachael's recipes run the gamut from Breakfast to late night snacks and everything in between.  Yeah..you won't find things like these in Bon Appetit or Food & Wine.  Sandwhiches...(great sandwhiches in fact)  Burgers, pasta's, Salads, finger foods and more.  I really love the late-night snack receipe as often times that's about all I get for a dinner and they are good and fast and filling.<br /><br />The other thing I love about Rachael's recipes is that they don't require a lot of fancy tools.  Chances are the average person has everything they need to whip these up and it all falls into the goal of making these quick and easy.<br /><br />The complaints that Rachael's recipes are unsophisticated miss the point.  How many of us have the time to sit down and make the kids of things that Wolfgang Puck or jacques Peppin make?  Unless you're basically a homebody with no kids, I'm guessing not many of us do.  Those kinds of shows...Even Lagasse, are more for entertainment.  Rachael's show and books are for practicality.  No..they may not win awards for presentation.

In the hopes of solving the mystery of 'V.F.D.,' the children choose a village by that name as their new home. They are sent to live with a kind man named Hector who has a library of forbidden books.

When the Baudelaires are falsely accused of murder and imprisoned, they must escape from the jail and find their friends the Quagmires, who are hidden somewhere in the village.<br /><br />Enjoyable romp with a bit of a different antagonist being the village elders.

Appearing in Strange Tales 101 in November of 1962, this was not even a year after the debut of Fantastic Four #1.  I guess Stan must have really liked the Torch since he was a holdover from the Golden Age even though it's not the SAME character.<br /><br />These very early Marvel stories from the early to mid-1960's are pretty simplistic and crude.  The Torch battles a fairly ridiculous array of villians like The Beetle, Paste-Pot pete, The Eel, Plantman, etc...but there were still some interesting team-ups that included his teammate The Thing, Spider-man and Iceman.<br /><br />This Volume which collects Strange Tales 101 - 134 collects all of the 12 page stories that appeared in those pages as well as Annual #2. The Stories are by Stan Lee, Pencilled by the Great Jack Kirby and inked by his long-time partner Dick Ayers.  These are marvel comics of a simpler time...owing more to the Golden Age than to the revolutionary comics that Marvel would be making in just a few year.<br /><br />Great nostalgic fun!	2004-12-28

Howard and had undergone a revival in the 1960's with the release of the Ace/Lancer paperback editions of the Howard Stories.<br /><br />Still, it was an interesting decision to give him his own title..Wow..and what a decision!  The Conan title ran for nearly 30 years, and also included the companion titles King Conan, and the B & W magazine Savage Sword of Conan.<br /><br />This huge trade paperback collects the first 25 issues of the conan comic written by Roy Thomas and drawn by a newcomer, British artist Barry Smith.  Smith began as an artist heavily influenced by Jack Kirby, but over time began to develop own distinctive, and very detailed style.<br /><br />His Barbarian differed than that of Frank Frazetta's in that Smiths was a younger, leaner, even skinny type, as opposed to Frazetta's heavily muscled giant.  This image tended to turn some people off a bit but Smith has gone on to become such a renowned master that I think his work now gets the praise it justly deserves.<br /><br />The first 25 issues are a mix of original stories by Roy Thomas as well as Howard adaptions such as \\"The Tower of the Elephant\\" and \\"Rogues in the House\\" as well as the first appearance of Red Sonja.  There was also a silly teaming with Michael Moorcocks Elric which was way out of place.<br /><br />it's nice to see Marvel's Essential collection put out at such an affordable price even if they are in B&W.  This Conan collection is a must for any conan fan.	2004-12-28

Thank God!  Because Dilbert remains the most consistently funny comic strip in the papers.  A daily dose of wry, sarcastic wit that is daily bread to those of us toiling away in an office environment.<br /><br />The title of this book says it all...who hasn't wanted to smack the person reviewing us upside the head and ask them what the hell were they thinking when they wrote it.

This massive edition of Essentials is the first that collects the adventures of Doctor Strange, the Master of the Mystic Arts.  These collect the good Doctors Earliest Adventures from the days of Strange tales including his very first appearance in Strange Tales 110, and including a full run from #114 to 168 spanning the hey day of the 1960's.<br /><br />In these pages wer first learn of Strange's Origin, meet the Ancient One and Clea, and also Docs greatest villians including Dormammu, Satannish, Baron Mordo, and others.  Doc's 1960's adventures really played well in the 1960's.  Steve Ditkos unique style fit the psychadelic era to perfection with his rendering of the strange and fantastic realms that Doctor Strange would visit along with some of the most terrifying entities in the Marvel universe.<br /><br />Doctor Strange has always been among the most underrated of Marvel Characters.  He always had pretty good writers and artists doing his stories.  Artists like Ditko, Brunner, Gene Colan, and Paul Smith who captured the feel of the mesmerizing world of Doctor Strange.<br /><br />Of course his world was always so vibrant that it suffers a bit from the Essential B&W format but I stll heartily recommend the book for any Doc fan.	2004-12-28

The book plods along at an uneven pace, and far too much time is devoted to developing secondary characters. The book, however, is not completely devoid of redeeming qualities. Carpenter's knack for characterization shows through although at the expense of the action many \\"Conan readers\\" are accustomed to.<br /><br />Carpenter wasn't the best of the Conan pastiche writers but he wasn't the worst either.  He's far better than Roland Green for example.  This book is ok, but a little slow and lacking in Howard-style action and swordplay.	2004-12-27

And here it was that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-man, first in the pages of an old sci-fi book called Amazing Fantasy #14 and then onto his own title.<br /><br />Essential Spider-man at over 500 pages collects Amazing Fantasy #15, Amazing Spider-man #1 - 20 and annual #1 into one huge and entertaining volume.  This is the roots of the character who has gone onto become Marvel's flagship character and the star of big budget movies.<br /><br />I'll admit that back in the 1970's I always frowned on Ditko's art as being old-looking compared to newer material.  But as I've age so have my tastes matured and I've really grown to appreciate and admire his fine detail.<br /><br />These 20 issues are so key in spider-man Lore.<br /><br />#1 is the first appearance of J.J.

I'm not so sure how much of this is expert advice as opposed to common sense, but sometimes common sense is not an easy thing to have.<br /><br />You'll be surprised on some of the things you'll learn or, maybe more aptly put, remember, about some every day tasks we take for granted.  Still the sections on rembering names, etiquette, etc are quite useful if you deal with people on a daily basis.<br /><br />Sections about washing one's hair may be a bit trite but they're at least done with a bit of tongue-in-cheek flair and still fun to read.	2004-12-17

In truth, many receipes to take more than 30 minutes but perhaps i'm just not as fast when it comes to preparation, but even if it takes 45 minutes to an hour, that's certianly not bad.<br /><br />Ray calls for ingredients that are common and can be found at any grocery store.  No need to seek out exotic items that can only be found at specialty markets.  There are over 150 recipes contained in the book, all simply and easily prepared, along with Ray's invaluable time-saving tips and secrets.<br /><br />Rachael's style is breezy and fun with a lot of hip little cooking lingo that fans of her show are sure to recognize.  As mentioned, unless one is really a pro at maneuvering about the kitchen, you won't finish most of these recipes in 30 minutes but that's not a bother to me.  What I love most about Ray is that unlike most Food TV hosts, she is not a professional chef and therefore doesn't have the smugness that many other TV cooks do and I think this helps her relate much better to the everyday person.<br /><br />If I have one complaint about the book it's the lack of photographs.

I had originally thought that this series was nothing more than a Harry Potter clone..how wrong I was.  This boxed gift set contains the first three books in hardcover: The Bad Beginning, The Reptile Room, and The Wide Window.<br /><br />Much tragedy and unfortunate things befall the Baudelaire children, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. They were on the beach when a family friend, Mr. Poe, told them that their parents had died in the Baudelaire mansion in a fire. Mr. Poe explained that their parents had instructed that the children be put in the care of a relative, and the fortune would remain untouched until Violet was of legal age. It was decided that they were going to stay with Count Olaf, because he was the relative that lived closest to the Baudelaires' home, so he adopted the children. They all hated him from the moment they met him. Count Olaf was planning ways to gain control over the Baudelaire fortune.<br /><br />It is so refreshing to find an author who is funny without assuming that kids need potty jokes to laugh. The humor is dark, twisted, and hilarious.  While the Baudelaire Orphan's series are written for children, they can still be appreciated by mature readers. You truly root for Violet, Klaus, and Sonny and feel sadness and anger over their plight. Count Olaf is truly a degenerate villain for whom nothing is too extreme even murdering a child. Very few villains can be so simply crafted yet inspire such revulsion from the reader. Oddly enough this is a feat rarely accomplished by other more widely recognized by the public.<br /><br />Those who criticize it's \\"dark\\" tone just don't get it.	2004-12-03

But I do still have fond memories of staring at the wonderful chrismas displays in their windows when I was a child attending the annual Hudson's Thanksgiving day parade.<br /><br />This wonderful little book by Michael Hauser details hudson's history from it's initial construction to it's final, sad, demolition.  At it's peak, the massive Hudsons store spanned an entire city block and employed more than 10,000 employees.<br /><br />Through his text and archival photos, you'll see as Hudsons was built from a single building to a sprawling complex of many buildings over the years.  The great photography includes many shots of those great christmas displays in the windows as well as the yearly interior holiday decorating themes, and shots of the classic parade.<br /><br />This is the tale of a store that was once a one-stop shopping location for everything:  Clothes, Furniture, appliances, Toys, tools...truly the days of a multiple floor dept. store.  And Hudson's serviced everything, from appliances to fur coats.<br /><br />Among the most interesting parts and photos deal with the amazing instrastructure of the store...the massive power and boiler rooms to keep the place heated and lighted...the floor dedicated to the storage of over 500 elevator motors.  The multitude of pneumatic tubes that went to every corner of the complex, the in house switchboard and operator dept.  The store even had its own on-site hospital with 4 full-time doctors and 6 nurses.<br /><br />Hudson's was truly a city unto itself in its prime.  A place for members of high society to shop for expensive fur coats and jewelry and for the common man to shop for t-shirts, get a haircut, or a shoeshine.<br /><br />A step back in time to an era we will never see again.  Highly recommended!	2004-12-03

We talked for about 15 minutes and he wanted to talk more about the Sox than his books!  That was about 15 years ago and he's remained a truly passionate fan.<br /><br />This book with his daily journal is really a hoot to read.  It's kind of cool to see a guy who's a millionaire many tims over agaonizing over his favorite sports team just like the guy on the assembly line in the Ford plant.<br /><br />King paints a picture filled with hope yet covered with a layer pessimism that only one who has seen so many dashed hopes can ever relate to.  The missives back and forth between King and O' Nan, discussing stats and performances like a couple of fan boys was so fun to read.  It's serendipitous too that this, the most significant and eventful season in Red Sox history, was the one King and O'Nan happened to chronicle. It had more tortuous (often torturous) story lines and plot points than either novelist could hope to devise - from the team's promising start to its maddening mid-season mediocrity to its overpowering win streak that annihilated the wild-card competition to its monumental post-season comeback.<br /><br />What a read.

Almost all Americans celebrate Christmas but so few of us really know its deep-rooted and ancient origins as well as the origins of so many of the traditions we hold so dear.<br /><br />In his wonderful book called, Jock Elliott has charted all of this story (and more) with care and good cheer. He reminds us of how recent the Christmas \\"tradition\\" is, and how ancient. He tells us, for example, that the Christmas tree is basically a product of the second half of the American 19th century, and can be traced to England. The British royal family - themselves imports from Germany - first pitched such trees in their palatial homes. But the trees, and the rituals of winter celebrations, could themselves be traced all the way back to pagan times and the celebrations of the winter solstice.<br /><br />We learn about the men who defined Santa claus Including Clement Moore who wrote the \\"Night Before Christmas\\", and Thomas nast.  Nast was the greatest political cartoonist of the 19th century, perhaps of any American century.  During the holiday season of 1862-63, Nast put visual flesh on the poetic bones provided by Moore.  In the Jan. 3, 1863, issue of Harper's Weekly, he showed Santa Claus cheering up the battered Union troops. He's wearing striped pants and a shirt spangled with stars. Nast would do a year-end drawing of Santa Claus for each of the following 25 years.<br /><br />From giving gifts to misletoe, Elliots great book fills us in on the origins of Everything Christmas.

I remember in the 70's and 80's when the film had fallen into public domain and could be seen on TV throughout the year.  One local UHF station used to show it at least once a week I think.  I never much considered it a Christmas movie since really only the last 30 minutes or so take place during Christmas.<br /><br />Now of course it is that annual holiday tradition and shown on Network TV.  This great book takes you behind the scenes to see what went into making the movie, interviews with cast members, and lots of little known facts about the production.  A must have for fans of the movie	2004-12-01

Through an unseemly amount of pressure and a bit of bribery, I agreed to read this book which she loaned me.<br /><br />i have to admit I've found myself very curious as to Clay's incredible popularity, particularly among women in their 30's and 40's.  These \\"clay-maniacs\\" are really fanatical about Clay in an almost Beatles-like way.<br /><br />But I have to say I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this book.  It's quite refreshing to read about a celebrity who is SO down to Earth and not all ego.  Almost forgotten is that Clay finished 2nd on idol and yet has perhaps become the show's biggest star out of its three seasons.<br /><br />Here's a guy who seemed to have such a hard early childhood and fought so hard to gain acceptance.  And in now finding such sudden fame its clearly NOT gone to his head as he remains so rooted in his faith in God and family.<br /><br />He poigniantly tells of resisting any attempts to perhaps go for a younger audience by writing songs with more of an edge to them.  Thankfully he is sticking to his guns as there are more than enough foul-mouthed, gyrating acts in music today with a lot of flair and no substance.<br /><br />I was really touched by the book and have found a new respect for the man and the star.	2004-11-17

I think most people still prefer their Thanksgiving with all of the traditional dishes.<br /><br />Betty Crocker's book does just that while still giving you some new things to try, without making them too intimidating for the novice cook.  Add to that the best sections of the book may be the sections on planning your dinner from shopping to all the make-aheads to getting the turkey ready for the oven.<br /><br />You'll find all of the great traditional fare in this book with straight forward and easy to follow recipes no matter what the size of your gathering.<br /><br />If your a traditionalist like me, then this is the book for you.	2004-11-16

I hate to say but the author is right.  But not in a bad way.  Author David Seldman provides some wonderful instructional tips and the photography is magnificent.  I've looked at this book over and over again to get ideas for my own front yard.<br /><br />Yes, you have to be a little obsessed when it comes to decking out your home with so many thousands of lights that the electric meter whizzes around like a top out of control.  I know people like this...they begin their planning for their outdoor displays in the early fall, long before Halloween...even drawing layouts of various display items will go.  I used to think it was a bit crazy until I started getting into larger displays.  If you don't plan in advance you'll be sure to end up with something out of wack like having cords in the wrong place or needing more outlets.<br /><br />It is obsessive but it's an obsessive love of the holidays.  This book has some absolutely eye-popping displays and really gives more novice decorators like myself some fantastic ideas for my own home. I'm not going to buy a computer to control eveything, but you'll be awed by some of the elaborate displays of lights and technology that some people have.<br /><br />Wonderful book!	2004-11-16

Books	4	17	20	N	N	CARLIN STILL THE MASTER OF HIS CRAFT	Carlin was recently voted as the #2 standu-up comedian of all-time and his caustic wit and biting satire have shown no signs of mellowing with age.<br /><br />\\"When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?\\" is not original material.  If you've seen his act in the past few years chances are you've already heard most of the material but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying it.<br /><br />As in his previous books, Napalm and Silly Putty and Braindroppings he provides in essay form many of the routines he's performed live and on HBO. In recent years, he has focused his natural love of words and language on a rather Orwellian trend - the diminution of meaning by the expansion of verbiage. He's always hated hypocrisy (while fully aware it is necessary lest human beings slaughter one another in even greater numbers than usual). But as marketing and advertising occupy more and more of Americans' time, the situation has gone critical.<br /><br />We get his takes on ridiculous advertising terms such as \\"home-style\\" and \\"Chocolate-flavored\\".  Things we never think of as humorous until cultivated by Carlin's unique perspective.<br /><br />Mr. Carlin is at his best in the quick, goofy statement of almost logic. \\"You know what kind of guy you never see anymore? A fop.\\" Or \\"Ignore these four words.\\" He had an uncle who, when he retired, didn't get a gold watch. Instead his former employer calls him every hour to tell him the time. \\"If no one knows when a person is going to die, how can we say he died prematurely?\\"<br /><br />Classic Carlin...	2004-11-16

There are so many great websites out there such as the Internet Movie Database where you can get reviews in an instant that it has made old paper guides almost stone-age in comparison.  I mean, the fact that by the time they hit the market, there are all ready hundreds of newer releases not in the book.<br /><br />Still, I love Maltin's wit and his enthusiasm.  He's never been high-brow like many reviewers and has a great appreciation for animation like I do.<br /><br />His book has reviews for over 20,000 movies, an index of leading actors and actresses, and much more.

She's fun, enthusiastic, personable.  Other than Lagasse she's my favorite person to watch on the Food Channel.<br /><br />She's back with her second edition of her famous 30 minutes meals, which details many of the recipes seen on her TV shows.  Ray's biggest appeal is making meals out of common ingredients that you won't have to go on a scavenger hunt to find at specialty food stores...not to mention they are budget conscious.<br /><br />Honestly, many of the recipes do take over 30 minutes to prepare since you don't have a staff doing prep work.  But even that's no big deal.  Bottom line is she features meals that are quick, easy, delicious, and fun to prepare.	2004-11-12

It is such an overwhelming place that you cannot go without a good guide or two.<br /><br />Sehlinger's is one of the absolute best.

What?  are the message boards at Yahoo not working today?<br /><br />Anyway, this is an important story for kids of any age to read and learn.  I've read several books on the American Revolution and I never cease to be amazed at the courage and resolve that George Washington and his men showed during that bitter winter.<br /><br />Washington's strict but caring command eventually earned him the full support and love of his men.  Men who endured bitterly cold temperatures, living in wood shacks with clothing ill-suited to the extreme weather, and only trying to survive, let alone actually face the most powerful army on earth at the time.<br /><br />In an age where people are only toO ready to look towards their leaders for their next handouts, it's inspiring to read about people who sacrificed so much in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.<br /><br />I think that this small story is one that can be told to kids of any age.  From the first time to youngsters as well as serving as a reminder to even kids at the high school level.  It's important for them to know the great sacrifices that these men made for their country.<br /><br />What a joy to read!  Thank you Mrs. Cheney!	2004-11-10

About how Kobe complained about the quality of the jet which flew Kobe from his courtroom appearances in Colorado back to LA.<br /><br />Phil documents how he had wanted to trade Kobe as long ago as the 2000 season but was denied by Lakers Owner Jerry Buss, in whose eyes Kobe can do no wrong.<br /><br />Phil documents how he comlained to GM Mitch Kupchack that he could no longer coach Kobe but his hands were tied and it was at that point that Phil knew he would not return for the 2004-2005 season.<br /><br />Ultimately the house of cards came crumbling down in the NBA finals against the Detroit Pistons.  Another person argued that the Pistons were not as talented...a fact that I whole-heartedly disagree with.<br /><br />The Lakers certainly had the two best players...but the best TEAM was the Pistons.

This book details just as many failings of our governemt (both during the Clinton and Bush Administrations) as it does our successes.  But liberals do NOT want to hear about any such success stories.<br /><br />They patently belive nothing goes on in the world unless its reported on CBS news.  Mr. Miniter is here to show what most intelligent people alreay know:  That there's much more going on in the war against terror that is NEVER reported than IS reported.<br /><br />Plots, conspiracies, war plans, covert Ops that may not be legal but HAVE been very successful at eliminating members of Al-Queda and other terrorist organizations.<br /><br />See...it's one thing to sit back and say \\"I will kill the terrorists\\" it't another thing to actually do it and not  have to have some ridiculous passing of a global test..<br /><br />Mr. Miniter's book details many successful operations but pulls no punches as to the Bush administrations failures.<br /><br />Try and put party lines aside and read the book.  There's more to the war on terror than that comes out of Dan Rather's mouth.<br /><br />The fact is we ARE safer than we were 3 or 4 years ago.  These ridiculous claims of Al-Queda being back at 100% capacity are baseless lies from scare tactic liberals.<br /><br />You don't win a war on terror by ignoring they exist or by trying to bribe them off...	2004-10-08

After the liberal left has done nothing but churn out one book after another, lambasting President Bush, it's about time we got another viewpoint and yes, an independent viewpoint.<br /><br />Kessler's book shows the human side of Bush.  Liberals are SO very quick to point out his foibles, his mis-pronunciation of words, his use of slang, his Texas heritage and run him into the ground because of that.<br /><br />Being President means doing things that are sometimes unpopular.  The President's job is NOT to make the rest of the world love us.  We've been cow-towing to terrorists too long. Bush has made choices that have been very difficult.  He's been President during the most difficult era since WWII.<br /><br />Ronald Kessler's inside, authoritative account of how George W. Bush has applied principled leadership to the tough task of defeating terrorism and preserving freedom should be read by everyone who cares about our national security.<br /><br />A Wonderful Book.	2004-08-06

As the man of the house, I do all the cooking by my choice.  I love to cook.  As so many these days though, I'd found my family relying more and more on takeout or delivery food then home cooked meals.  Time is a hot commodity in most peoples lives, but Saving Dinner really helps you temendously.<br /><br />I consider myself a pretty good cook. What I was lacking was the organizational weekly shopping list to help pull the meal together.  I found myself stopping at the store almost daily to pick up the items I needed just for that evenings meal.<br /><br />Well, Leanne's cookbook saved the day. I now have the lists I struggled to put together on my own. Her meals are delicious and, best of all, take little time to prepare. It saved our meal time.<br /><br />The recipes are easy, fast, and delicious.  And lots of really good variety.  Not the standard stuff you see in so many cookbooks today.  And, I might add, one heckuva bargain from Amazon at just over 10 bucks.	2004-08-05

I was surprised, and a bit intimidated to find that there were literally dozens of books on the subject.<br />Taking a stab, I stared with \\"The Templar Revelation\\" by English authors Lynn Pickett and Clive Prince.  This is, I think, a good jumping off point for people as it delves into many of the mysteries surrounding all of the above subjects in relation to the true identity of Jesus Christ.<br />You will read about the founding of the Knights Templar, and how there may have been much more behind their founding than trying to retake the holy land and convert the heretics.  Did they actually know the secrets of Jesus Christ and are the ones protecting the true history?  Was the Templar inner circle actually the founding members of the Priory of Scion?<br />Much of the book is spent discussing the mystery of Mary Magdalene.  Various theories are discussed such as Mary actually being married to Christ and actually being his most trusted apostle.  One theory goes that it was Mary who actually carried on Christ's church after his death, and her work was subsequently covered up by the church and the Gospels that speak of her (such as the Gnostic gospels and Gospels of Phillip) were purposely left out of the new testament.<br />You'll explore relations to worship of Mary Magdalene to the Egyptian cults of the Goddess Isis, and of the startling similarities between Christ's death and resurrection and similar stories of pagan gods death and resurrection.  Startling to say the least.<br />Then there is the mystery behind the French Abbey of Rennes-Le-Chateau.  A strange and provocative mystery about the priest who seemingly had endless wealth to build a very strange abbey filled with both Christian and pagan symbolism.  Where did he get this money from?  Was it a secret treasure he found?  Was he funded by some mysterious benefactor?  Could he actually have uncovered the secret remains of Mary Magdalene, long buried on the site?<br />The theories come rapid pace in this book and it's sometimes difficult to keep them all straight.  The authors do not forward any particular theory, but rather try to lay them all out with as much fact as possible.  It certainly gives one to pause and certainly devout Christians may have some big problems with the idea of Jesus being married, fathering children, and possibly embracing pagan beliefs.<br />Among the most interesting and somewhat chilling proposals is what seems to be a concerted and diligent effort on the part of the catholic church to not only erase, but to rewrite history.  There's no doubt that Gospels were written around the same time as those included in the new Testament, that were left out purposely.<br />As I said, it's a good jumping off point to explore some of these theories and there are many more books out there that delve into greater detail on these various ideas and concepts.  But it's definitely a fascinating read.ome mysterious benefactor?

The cartooning is less polished, the characters less developed, but that's what makes this so much fun.<br />Fantagraphics is beginning a chronological reprinting of all of Charles Schultz' peanut strips.  Each volume in the series will run approximately 320 pages in a 8\\" x 6 1/2\\" hardcover format, presenting two years of strips along with supplementary material. The series will present the entire run in chronological order, dailies and Sundays. Since the strip began in late 1950, the first volume will include all the strips from 1950, 1951, and 1952, but subsequent volumes will each comprise exactly two years. Dailies will run three to a page, while Sunday strips will each take up a full page and be printed in black-and-white, an aesthetic choice agreed upon by the editors, the designer, and Mrs. Schulz.<br />Most of these strips from the first couple of years have never been published before so it's quite interesting to see the genesis of the characters.  Some of the original cast (Schroeder, Lucy, and Linus) - originall are infants and and evolve into the kids we know today as the months go by. Even Snoopy debuts as a tiny puppy!<br />Still, despite the rough feel of these early strips, you can see the wry humor of Schultz fully on display.  I heartily recommend this for ANY Peanuts fan.	2004-05-05

Rather than a typical dry history book you feel like you are reading a good piece of fiction.<br />Beginning with events long before the Revolution, we meet a couple of gentlemen who have been a bit lost in history thanks to larger names like Washington and Jefferson...namely Samuel Adams and James Otis.<br />Yes Sam Adams was a brewer but As we learn, Adams was really among the first to make the push for independence among Boston colonialists.  Langguth goes over in detail the roots that led to war.  Of the English blockades in Boston harbor and the Stamp Act.<br />The first shots at Lexington and Concorde are described in an exciting narrative style.  We see that these were not pitched battles as we may have thought, but rather small forces of British soldiers opposed by smaller rag-tag groups of Americans.<br />In particular, the battle of Bunker Hill really puts you at the battle as The British stubbornly tried to keep taking the hill despite heavy losses.<br />One by one we are introduced to our Founding Fathers: Washington, Jefferson, John Hancock, Patrick Henry, John Adams, Ben Franklin.  We learn much of the personal lives before thier involvement in the Revolution.<br />Langguth also takes us behind the battles into the political and diplomatic sides.  We see that many in England actually supported the colonists, at least early on.  There was as much political intrigue as any modern day suspense novel.<br />A very well done book.  Especially good for those who don't generally enjoy reading about history.	2004-02-19

Not a fantasy character in the vein of Conan, Kull, or Bran Mak Morn, Gordon was one of Howard's Historical adventure heroes.<br />Historical adventure was one of Howards favorite genres and he created stories clearly influenced by writers such as Burroughs, Mundy, and others.<br />Gordon was an American adventurer who stars in several short stories taking place primarily in the middle east.  Arabs were one of Howard's favorite villians, even in Conan stories where Egypt becomes Stygia.<br />Gordon is a hard-punching, quick-shooting character, similar I would Say to the Brendan Fraser Character in the Mummy movies.  the stories take place roughly circa the 20's and 30's when these lands were still roughly untamed.<br />They're quick, action packed tales.  If all you know about Howard is Conan, you'd do well to tray and dig up this and other books of his lesser known creations.  Good stuff.	2004-01-06

Look, Howard wasn't writing to win awards.  He was writing in as many markets as possible to earn a living in the depression.<br />He was not above canibalizing his own work and would do so as one of the stories would also be used as the Conan tale, The Treasure of Tranicos, with only some names changed.<br />Short but fun work.	2004-01-06

The being uses opium to control people and do his bidding.<br />The Being, one Kathulos (cthulhu?) is supposed to be a sorcerer who was found in a tomb and is a survivor of ancient Atlantis.<br />A little outlandish but kind of a fun adventure story.

Now, you can read the stories by humorist Jean Shepherd that inspired the book.<br />While all of the stories themselves didn't actually take place during Christmas, they were all woven together to make the film.  Read about Ralphies quest for the Red Ryder BB gun, about the battle with bully Grover Dill, the &quot;Old Man&quot; winning the leg lamp, an more.<br />Five stories in all in this light, but funny book.  It's interesting to see how the the stories were all incorporated into the movie and Shepherd himself was on the set making sure the director stayed very close to the spirit of his work.<br />Great book.	2004-01-02
