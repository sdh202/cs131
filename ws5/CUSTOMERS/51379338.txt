Over the course of her book, she discovers she owns a growing spiritual awareness, and as many before her, she diagnoses her ailment as similar to that of The Fisher King-a  loss of connection with the Ground of Being- i.e., the Natural World. A former agnostic, she comes to view the divine as feminine and immanent NOT the transcendent-masculine-\\"out there\\"-thunder God of paternalistic religions.<br /><br />I was amazed with the similarities between the events Curott describes compared with those occurring in my own life. Some of them were virtually identical. I too have experienced illuminating dreams, synchronicity, and the growing strength of my sixth sense, which by turns frightens and amuses me. Curott suggests the key is learning how to \\"see\\".<br /><br />Curott is a well educated person and she writes well. Her imagery is quite effective. I don't think this book is an introduction to the subject of WICCA.  If you are just beginning to study Wicca and want to understand more about how a coven works, I recommend you read Adler's `Drawing Down the Moon' and/or Starhawk's `Spiral Dance' before you read Curott's book. Both of the former were written from the perspective of a participant observer, but they may be less frightening to the novice who feels she does not yet believe in magic.<br /><br />If you want to examine the practice of solitary witchdraft from a first person subjective viewpoint check out books by Moura or Rae Beth. Cunningham also writes from a detached position, as a solitary reporting to the rest of the world about the procedures of witchcraft as he practiced it. Curott belongs to a coven, but she didn't go out and join one, she evolved with others into a coven which she describes in the book. Her descriptions of the events that transpired for her and others that led her to admit to the world that she is a witch are powerful.<br /><br />The text describes the course of Currott's everyday life and how it merges with her expanding awareness and her assumption of the power to change her own life. She says her coven works magic to empower its members and protect them from harm, not to harm others-but the `just desserts' dished out to  those harming the witches in this tale are just perfect.d her to admit to the world that she is a witch are powerful. <br /> <br />The text describes the course of Currott's everyday life and how it merges with her expanding awareness and her assumption of the power to change her own life.

If you are like me and looking for ways to eat veggies without being obvious, you will enjoy some of Cait Johnson's ideas for soups, salads and breads.<br /><br />The big plus is that most of Cait's recipes are fairly healthful.  Take the Cailleach or Kale-Leek Soup. Made without cream or butter, it includes olive oil and two veggies that are good for you.<br /><br />Arranged seasonally, Johnson't book begins with Autumn (Mabon and Samhain fare) and continues through the witch's year to the festivities in mid-Spring when Johnson offers the reader-cook a lovely Miso soup and Salad Nests that are good for you and don't taste too bad (if you like sprouts, it will help).<br /><br />I'm not much of a summer cook, but Titania's Cherry Soup made with honey, yogurt and Maple syrup finally allows me to make something other than muffins with my spring cherries.  The Midsummer salad helps me make use of the various excess from the stock of hot peppers I grow every year for my parrots and my son-in-law.  One of my favorite soups, however, is the Tomato-Venus soup around the feast of Lugh which I prefer to the cherry soup, which seems truly weird to me. Or, there's Juno's Summer Quiche if you can bear to turn on the oven.<br /><br />In addition to following the Wheel of the Year and it's holidays as an organizing principle for her text, Johnson includes a little mystical background information about each of the various celebrations along with a list of supplies and other-worldly information.	2005-09-29

THE COMPLEAT SQUASH is about squash and pumpkins.  Unless I am blind, there is nary a gourd to be found in these pages-at least not as I would know them.  Billed as such, I expected Amy Goldman's book to cover all the members of the Cucurbita family (squash), as well as other items mentioned on the cover (pumpkins and gourds-especially the relatively inedible bird's nest gourd (birds sometimes like the seeds)). I've grown some great bird's nest gourds this summer, and I want to preserve them for next spring's bird's nests and this book won't be a bit helpful.<br /><br />Not that the photographs in this book aren't beautiful. Goldman's text is a bit fluffy-do we really care that she would like to \\"Throw them [the Canada Squash] over her shoulder like a Continental Soldier\\" Besides that's ears or something else isn't it? In her own city-girl way, Goldman has managed to cover most of the bounty you may find at your specialty grocer's this fall, as well as the many you found over the summer if you live in New York or another location with a sophisticated farmer's market.  You probably won't find them at Shopper's Food Warehouse.<br /><br />Goldman has included 30 pages of recipes covering everything from `Stuffed Squash Blossom Tempura; to `Southwestern Winter Squash Chowder', probably the most useful portion of her book. As I wanted to know more about gourds, this book is an expensive disappointment.	2005-09-24

At last, a book that meets my expectations.  Marilyn Host starts with the assumption you have already grown your gourds, or purchased them from a nearby market and are ready to work with them. She covers everything from identifying the individual gourds by type to selecting the general materials you will need for your projects, such as soap, bleach, scouring pads, knives, spoons, glue sticks, scissors, sandpaper, pencils, rags, saws, drills, brushes, paints and dyes, sponges, and twine as well sealing agents. She then describes the steps for preparing the gourd by cleaning the surface and interior, and carving the gourd while it is pliable. Assembly of a specific item may involve combining forms, puncturing and/or extracting sections of the surface, as well as painting and/or decoupage. Using photos and well written text, Goldman describes in great detail the construction of a number of gourd products ranging from containers to decorative pieces.<br /><br />While this little book is very thorough, the projects are relatively complex and mostly for adults.  I personally would use this book with older girls, but not younger children (especially most little boys) unless you are working one on one with a responsible child.  If you plan to use gourds for a group craft project, be prepared to do the prep work involving knives and drills yourself. You can then let the kids apply paints, dyes, and glue to their heart's content. There are some nifty ideas for masks, bird houses and luminaries but all require puncturing and cutting. This is an excellent craft book.	2005-09-24

Over the years, I've read 'The Writing Life' segment found in many a Washington Post \\"Book World\\" section. Last spring, a writing instructor assigned Arana's collection of these articles for our outside class reading. I was pleased to find many of the articles I had previously enjoyed plus plenty I had not read combined in one volume, thus allowing me to purge the accordian file folder where I store such items.<br /><br />Arana has selected some of the best pieces for her volume, and prefaced each with a short introduction of the author.  In some cases I reread segments by favorite authors, and in other cases I had never read the author.<br /><br />One author I've been meaning to try is Barbara Mertz.  Haven't heard of her?  She writes under the pen name Elizabeth Peters, and is the author of the the tales of the exploits of Amelia Peabody-Emerson, archeologist and sleuth.  Now, I had thought about reading Peters, but had not done so because I have been trying to curb a hopeless addiction to mysteries and force myself to read things that \\"improved my mind.\\"  Peters, i.e. Mertz, says at age 60, she figures her mind \\"is about as good as it's going to get\\" and that statement and others she wrote made me laugh.  Being from a long line of folks suffering from a bad case of the \\"Protestant ethic\\" I've always needed permission to have fun, and now that I am 63 I have it.<br /><br />I read my first Peters novel (reviewed elsewhere) and ordered 6-7 more. Is this frivoluous, you bet. Will I keep it up, Hopefully!!	2005-09-04

As bizarre as it may seem to devoted fans, this was my first Amelia Peabody mystery. I enjoyed the book immensely and recommend the author.  I have ordered several more books by Peters, i.e. Mertz who writes under a pen name.<br /><br />I believe the novice can begin the Amelia Peabody series with this book.  This particular mystery is not so devious, but I found the characters extremely likeable, and this is a true \\"cozy mystery.\\"  Also, as a fan of British film, tv, etc. and having experienced archeological \\"digs\\", I can appreciate the life style of 19th-early 20th Century British archeologists working in Egypt.<br /><br />True, I did not find this plot as complex as those of Marple or Poirot, and was not a bit frightened by various events, but in time I am confident I will find the author's earlier books quite riveting.  Although I did not understand some of the references to events in the previous books--why for example is Emerson called \\"The Father of Curses\\"?--I caught a few of the \\"inside\\" jokes, such as references to the melodramatic Romance writer turned victim, as I happen to know Barbar Mertz not only writes as Elizabeth Peters, but has a successful romance series written under the pseudonym \\"Michaels\\". I like this author very much, and as I said am reading more of her works.	2005-09-04

A scene takes place in the film Patton, where the General stands on the site of an ancient battlefield and describes his experiences as a combatant in a previous life on that very field.  In THE SECRET TEACHING OF PLANTS, Stephen Harrod Buhner describes a similar experience on a battlefield here in Virginia where the narrator \\"felt\\" the presence of the dead and dying soldiers. While this episode might seem farfetched, Buhner has woven a story that will lead you to believe this event can and did take place, no matter how rational you think you are.<br /><br />Buhner's book is about plants, but more than that it is about the human heart and its capacity to understand more than the head. The heart does indeed have its own reasons, and has much to communicate if we would listen.  As one who has a deep affinity for living organisms especially, birds, dogs, cats, and trees, and having lived with said creatures all my life and knowing for a fact that they all communicate with me, I do not believe that humans are the \\"be all end all\\" they believe themselves to be no matter how much they have recorded their own self importance in ancient texts.  In the end, belief is belief, but Buhner suggests there is much one may be missing if she does not listen to her heart. THE SECRET TEACHING OF PLANTS is a delicious wonderful treat, and I have taken weeks to read and reread a man who may indeed be a reincarnation of Thoreau or Goethe.	2005-08-17

I love Ann Moura's books, they are straightforward and spiritual offerings for the Witch.  Moura is the daughter and granddaughter of Brazilian witches who were also Roman Catholic. Over time,  Moura explored many other religions (she attended the Baptist church when she was a teenager) before she settled on witchcraft as her lifetime religion. Moura suggests that \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\" as well as perceptiveness, interconnectedness, and community are the core principles and essential beliefs of Witchcraft.<br /><br />Moura's book is written for the solitary witch, and it is a bit advanced for the beginner, who might find Scott Cunningham's book for solitary practitioners easier to follow, although I best loved Rae Beth's books for solitaries. Moura is an historian and she brings her knowledge of teaching history into her book.  She references respected authors such as Joseph Campbell and others who have studied the history of the old religion in an academic setting.  Although I have read many of Campbell's books and faithfully watched the Campbell interviews Bill Moyers conducted for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (produced before PBS was censored by elected officials-you can find these interviews at Amazon on DVD), I found new and interesting information in Moura's book.<br /><br />Moura suggests that all religions are interconnected springing from one source although what sets Witchcraft apart is that it is very intuitive, not following some out-of-date-orthodoxy.  Moura suggests that Wicca was not a 20th Century invention as some detractors imply, but it is a continuation of ages old practices, many of them incorporated into Christianity centuries ago. (Hel, for example was the Goddess of the Norwegian underworld, where pagans went when they died, according to Norwegian \\"mythology\\" -  hence perhaps, the comment by a church father that \\"pagans go to hell\\").

Pick up the May/June issue of The American Gardener or September issue of Herb Companion and you will find an article by Jo Ann Gardner about herbs. Gardner wrote LIVING WITH HERBS a few years back, so in some ways the information in her book should reflect her thinking then, while the articles should reflect her experiences since writing the book. For example, she began harvesting herbs drying them in bunches (some not all herbs dry well using this approach) and discovered that other ways of preserving the essences of the herbs worked better with some plants. First she used string and then she moved to the use of rubber bands. I too use rubber bands because they contract as the herb stems shrink, and you are less likely to loose a bunch of dried herbs. And, while Gardner eschews them, I use paper sacks as they catch falling material, particularly lavender buds/blossoms and the like. However, the current Herb Companion shows a photo accompanying Gardners article where of bunches of herbs are drying on a nifty `under-window' rack, and tied with string, some stems are falling on the floor!!<br /><br />Gardner says some herbs dry best hanging in bunches and some on drying racks (you can cheat by drying some of them in an oven on low heat), and some should be macerated while green and frozen or put up or in jars of oil or vinegar. LIVING WITH HERBS is a useful book, because you not only read about Gardner's experience with 100 or so of her favorite herbs (growing, preserving, using) you also discover some culinary applications (jellies, rolls, breads, salts, etc.) If you don't grown herbs yourself, you can order them from a number of sources.  Gardner has provided a useful if somewhat out-of-date bibliography that lists books and sources she prefers, but her gardening information is still useful.	2005-07-20

Vriend's book is not nearly as comprehensive, he goes deep whereas Soucek goes broad.  However, I appreciate the detailed sections on the selection, care and maintenance of incubators including photos of the various types of incubators as well as text describing air filtration systems (`still air' and ventilation), automatic egg turners versus doing it yourself, and temperature, light and humidity considerations. Interestingly, neither author cites the other even tho Barron's produced both books and they are somewhat complementary.<br /><br />As well as incubation, Vriends book covers feeding in great detail with numerous photos of very small chicks being hand fed.  I like this book because I needed more in-depth information about  actual feeding practices, including a discussion of the different nutritional needs of different birds who require formulas.  Whether you are raising companion birds or you are an animal rehabilitator/rescuer you will probably find this book useful.	2005-07-10

The fact that she has been able to raise baby parrots in such a cold hostile environment is amazing, especially when she informs the reader that at times she must transport the babies to work because they require \\"round-the-clock\\"feedings, just like human babies.  Of course she is hand raising the birds she feeds herself.  Parent raised babies are cared for all day by mom and dad, but hand raising birds is the key to training them to be friendly animal companions. Reading this book one wonders where Ms Soucek finds the time to care for birds as she works full time for a bird supply business, is involved with a number of bird organizations and writes articles and books.  Soucek says \\"you will never travel again\\" if you get into this business, and she has a point, although she undoubtedly travels to various locations to speak and lecture.<br /><br />Soucek covers all the important aspects of baby-bird  raising including parent nutrition and avian  reproduction; preventive health care, including when to call your vet and when to \\"do it yourself\\";  baby nutrition including diets and hand feeding; housing, including cage requirements (do you know the difference between an incubator and a brooder?), air, water and light requirements; characteristics of birds reproductive systems including the difference between DNA sexing and the more invasive laproscopic sexing.<br /><br />As a full-fledged bird breeder, I found this book highly informative, and recommend it to anyone who thinks bird-breeding is a \\"hobby.\\"	2005-07-10

First published in 1912 by `Country Life' as GARDENS FOR SMALL COUNTRY HOUSES, ARTS AND CRAFTS GARDENS by Gertrude Jekyll and Lawrence Weaver was republished years later as part of the Antique Collectors Club LTD, and now as a \\"revised edition with additional colo[u]r illustrations\\" by the Garden Art Press.  More art book than instructive garden guide, the modern publication includes many black and white illustrations as well as layout drawings of the houses and grounds discussed, as well as detailed examples of other features, appearing in the earlier volume, along with beautiful color photos and illustrations depicting specific design elements as they appear today. Thus the reader can determine what the landscaper saw and planned, and how well her design worked then and years later. Jekyll's foresight and intuitive understanding of the \\"art\\" of garden design (which many of us learn about the hard way) as  illustrated in this book, provides the modern reader with an idea of why Jekyll is still revered among garden designers.<br /><br /> The book title, `Gardens for Small County Houses',  may appear ludicrous to the contemporary reader, as it provides an overview of selected examples of  various gardens the authors developed in Surrey, Berkshire, and Guildford, which by today's standards are quite large. Chapters cover houses and gardens in their entirety, and at least one covers the \\"Treatment of Small Sites\\" such as Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, a gorgeous town house site. Other chapters cover selected design elements, such as \\"balustrades and walls\\", \\"steps and stairways\\" and retaining walls.  Most of these elements are used by modern landscape designers in large public settings and on a few \\"estates\\", but many cannot be adapted to the small scale urban garden. Many features of these \\"country\\" gardens were lifted from Roman villas and most of us don't own villas, however, some of the elements, such as pergolas, arbors, and trellises can and probably should be adapted to a modern urban garden.<br /><br />Because you probably wouldn't want to attempt to duplicate these designs on an average modern lot, the value of this book other than as a beautiful art book lies in its ability to inform.  You will want to study it before you visit one of the notable \\"estates\\" where Jekyll worked in England.to a modern urban garden.  <br /> <br />Because you probably wouldn't want to attempt to duplicate these designs on an average modern lot, the value of this book other than as a beautiful art book lies in its ability to inform.

In the May/June 2005 issue of THE AMERICAN GARDENER, Jo Ann Gardener wrote a rather good article about her favorite herbs for medicinal and culinary purposes.  Reading her article and subsequently her book HERBS IN BLOOM I realized her medicinal knowledge was mostly gleaned from books, not hands on experience.  The article includes the \\"cream\\" of what is found in the book, so I could have done without the book, but I am a book-addict, particularly a garden book addict, so I bought the book.  I like the inventory she provides covering the herbs she has apparently grown in her own garden, but as she gardens in NY (and formerly New England), her ideas are of limited use for one who lives and gardens in the upper South, on an urban lot.  She doesn't spend much time on \\"herbs in pots\\" which is the way I must grow many of my herbs, but she does have a nice section on Valerian, which I shall never again confuse with Centranthus.  I wish I had known sooner rather than later that Valerian required moist conditions and sun.  Unfortunately, I planted it where the sun shines all day, but where it grows relatively dry. So I discovered the hard way, that not all herbs like dry conditions, or moist shady ones for that matter. This is a nice, but slightly outdated book.  Look for the works of Rosemary Gladstar and Deb Soule for more information about the medicinal properties of herbs.	2005-06-29

What happens if folks put their money into beauty and eschew the ugly? These gardens may seem ornate given the relative poverty of the working classes, but they were open to the public on certain feast days, and served as a place of refinement before public works became the only respite for the poor.<br /><br />Many of the houses around which the Arts and Crafts gardens are designed are ancient, but contemporary designers like Gertrude Jekyll and William Robinson modernized the grounds.  Robinson built his gardens at Gravetye Manor around an Elizabethan structure and Jekyll developed Mustead Wood, a mere fifteen acres surrounding a house designed by Edwin Lutyens.  Robinson was interested in the \\"wild garden\\" and many of his flowers bloomed among the trees or flopped over wooden structures. A fan of bulbs he developed terraced sweeps of daffodils as well as bluebell woods, but for many folks the most beautiful part of Gravetye's grounds was the West garden where tea and China roses adorned pergolas, arbors and trellises.  The book includes prints, designs and color photos of the grounds Robinson owned as well as those he designed for others. Jekyll's interest lay in the design of perennial beds.<br /><br />Long after these artists were gone their influence was felt in England and other places.

Often overlooked, the so-called silver and `white' plants can provide a fabulous backdrop for other flowers and can soften the more vibrant colors such as red, orange and yellow. Some of silver plants such as various Achillea have their own lovely flowers, others are mainly grown for their foliage. Although many of the silvers do well in cooler climates where they are often found in raised beds or rock gardens, I have found it difficult to grow many of them in my wildly varying climate where summer days can be both muggy and hot and provide too much moisture or humidity (thus rotting the under leaves and branches of Lavender, Thyme, Rosemary, Santolina), or conversely, too much drought (thus killing the Ajuga).<br /><br />ELEGANT SILVERS includes many photographs taken in the Denver Botanical Garden (one of my favorite places to hang out for a day or two) where dry mountain air and raised beds make the growing of \\"silver\\" alpine plants quite possible. Many of the silvers that thrive in Denver are not suitable at all for growing in Southern gardens, however, as much as I would like them to be. Other photos of items listed in the rather comprehensive `Encyclopedia' included in this book were taken in dry desert areas of the West, and are thus perfect for xeroscaping (growing in hot dry areas), and some of these plants work in my garden until I get a humid summer. (My neighbor hangs a tarp over his garden when it rains for long periods). Gardner and Bussolini provide an index explaining which plants are suitable for which kinds of conditions, but as both of them garden in the northern areas of the US (New England, New York) their attempt to describe regional conditions may be a kind of overreaching.	2005-06-29

Over the centuries during and since Rome ruled the Western world, Roman gardens and villas were copied - while they were extant, and then again when they were rediscovered in ruins.  Designs from the grounds at  Hadrian's villa in Tivoli, frescos depicting the gardens of the House of the Golden Bracelet unearthed in Pompeii, and the excavated grounds of Tiberius' villa at Sperlonga all indicate the Romans garnered ideas from ancient Persia, Greece, Egypt and elsewhere and in turn provided the inspiration for designs executed in later centuries by other artists.<br /><br />Under the tutelage of Rome, structures and grounds such as those at the Villa Brioni in Croatia, Sabratha, Leptis Magna in Libya, and outposts in Morocco, Tunisia, England were developed as part of the Roman experience. This book suggests these structures and others are related to the \\"Great Houses\\"of 18th Century England, the Alhambra in Spain, and the J.Paul Getty Museum in Malibu.<br /><br />This beautiful book, containing hundreds of color photos, captures the essence of THE GARDENS OF THE ROMAN WORLD -- Another fine art book for your collection.	2005-06-29

MIRROR, MIRROR.....by Dottie Enderle.  I gave my 10-year old granddaughter Joy this wonderful book for her birthday, along with others by Enderle, and she read it in one day.  I asked her what it was about.  She said a girl named Gena wakes up one morning and when she looks at herself in the mirror, a different girl looks out at her. Gena has been slipping a stray cat into her bedroom at night, and she wonders if there is a connection between her disconcerting experience with the mirror and the cat, and if she will ever be able to see herself again.<br /><br />What would you do? Apparently Gena's dilemma whetted Joy's interest because while she read this book, she did not come up for air (all day yesterday), and I noticed she had started a new Enderle book this morning.  Now grandma has a winner with this author, and as this book is part of a series (The Fortune Tellers Club) there are more books where that came from.<br /><br />This should keep her occupied for at least a week during the long hot summer vacation.	2005-06-26

Are you ready to begin making your own tinctures, vinegar extracts, herbal infusions and teas as well as other decoctions?  Richo Cech, long time herbalist par excellence describes how to macerate, use various solvents or menstruum solutions, and create complex combinations or medicinal compounds. Although Cech clearly prefers an alcohol-based menstruum, he supplies formulas for other approaches for those who cannot tolerate alcohol.<br /><br />I have found the formulas which don't require alcohol provided by James Green in THE HERBAL MEDICINE-MAKERS HANDBOOK easier to execute and less costly because they don't use as much fancy equipment and my husband will use them, but Cech insists that to make long lasting solutions you will want to use grain alcohol or a good brand of Vodka as well as the \\"proper tools\\".  I use essential oils for various purposes, and dried herbs in teas, and in my experience both hold up at least one year.  We use them so fast I can't speak to longevity or shelf life (At this very moment as I type, I have applied an oil mix to my right hand to relieve pain from various causes such as arthritis and carpel tunnel, and it is working fine). I suppose if you are making up batches for sale you might have more concern with preservation, but I wouldn't worry about using an alcohol based formula on a child so much as tinctures are mostly diluted in water. (Cough syrup is an exception).<br /><br />If you are a gardener (or not) and are wondering how to preserve some of nature's bounty for medicinal (compressesses, salves, creams and other medicinal compounds) you might consider buying both books (Cech and Green) and conducting your own experiments, to see which approach works for you. This book has a dearth of illustrations, or else I would give it more stars.	2005-06-25

Have you ever come in from the garden on one of those balmy days when the sun is \\"just right\\" neither too hot nor too cold, but warm enough to draw the aroma from your flowers, and thought to yourself, \\"I would love to preserve that smell for a rainy day.\\" Well, you can by  bottling tonics, elixirs, hydrosols, syrups and other concoctions that upon opening in the middle of winter, have the power to transport back to summer days, and perhaps even cure the nasty cold or flu affecting you, or even better, help prevent your becoming sick in the first place.<br /><br />James Green is the most transparent of human beings, an admiral characteristic in someone who is a healer. Green lives what he writes about, and has for a number of years.  He is witty, wise, and compassionate.  His methods are clearly described and discussed. You too can make many of his products using standard kitchen equipment in your own home.What you make will have your own imprimatur as you will have control over the process and can modify the steps as need be.<br /><br />Green makes medicine.  Some herbalists disagree with the idea of focusing on herbal products as part of a medical model, preferring instead to practice only the holistic healing which concentrates on prevention by focusing on the context within which the individual lives. Sometimes, however, no matter what you do, you get sick.  Green not only shows you how to create products to deal with these lapses, he suggests ways to address them. Recipes as well as clear instructions for making tinctures, syrups, and other concoctions are included. You will probably get well just because they generally smell so good.	2005-06-22

This collection of scholarly papers was assembled into a fine book edited by W.F. Jashemski and Frederick Meyer. Jashemski is Professor Emeritus of Ancient History at the University of Maryland, College Park, where she pioneered the field of ancient Roman garden archeology, and a former senior fellow at Dumbarton Oaks in DC which houses a wonderful collection of Pre-Columbian Art as well as stunningly landscaped grounds. Dr. Meyer is the former Supervisory Botanist in charge of the Herbarium at the National Arboretum also in Washington DC.<br /><br />Selected chapters from the book cover a description of the site before the eruption in A.D. 79 based on the archeological, literary and Epigraphical Evidence. We know some of what we know about the fateful day owing to correspondence between Tacitus and Pliny the Younger, whose uncle Pliny the Elder perished in the catastrophe.  Other chapters cover the flora and fauna of the area (both Pompeii and Herculaneum were affected). Archeologists have determined the identity of extensive numbers of plants (including trees, vines, edible foodstuffs and culinary and medicinal herbs), mammals, amphibians and reptiles, birds (grey parrots and love birds were kept as pets).<br /><br />The book is filled with drawings and illustrations, as well as photographs of human and other animal, and plant remains; frescos from the villas and public buildings; jewelry and household items; and site shots including photos of the area surrounding the forum in Pompeii (including those taken from a balloon - with buildings clearly marked), as well as pictures of the archeologists at work capturing and preserving the natural material uncovered at the two sites.<br /><br />If you are about to embark on a trip to Pompeii, have an interest in Roman life as it was lived in the first century, or an interest in archeological forensics, you will find this book enlightening, but perhaps it is more suitable for the Art History or Classics section of a school library than a coffee table book as one of my colleagues suggested.and preserving the natural material uncovered at the two sites. <br /> <br />If you are about to embark on a trip to Pompeii, have an interest in Roman life as it was lived in the first century, or an interest in archeological forensics, you will find this book enlightening, but perhaps it is more suitable for the Art History or Classics section of a school library than a coffee table book as one of my colleagues suggested.        <br />	2005-06-18

THE PROFESSIONAL' S BOOK OF LOVEBIRDS by John Coborn covers their natural history, cages and aviaries, nutrition-health and hygiene-breeding Lovebirds and other topics.  Coburn provides suggestions for aviaries and cages and recommends aviaries because Lovebirds are ornamental birds, not necessarily good companion animals (although I have a very loveable Peach-faced (Agaponis roseicollis) Lovebird hand raised from a young chick).<br /><br />Coburn's book  includes over 180 color photographs and large type, so it is certainly visually appealing and relatively easy to read, although perhaps a bit dated (the suggested reading section won't include anything issued after 1991). For a surfeit of information about genetics and typology, Dr. D'Angieri's ATLAS on Lovebirds can't be beat, but for more comprehensive albeit easier to access and handle smaller book, you may want to buy Anne Appleyard's THE LOVEBIRD HANDBOOK published in 2001.	2005-06-15

ALL ABOUT BREEDING LOVEBIRDS, by Mervyn Roberts includes a nice section on Nutrition that covers what the little guys eat in the wild, where they apparently behave much like Crows in the States and plow up newly planted items in your garden as well as attacking mature fruits and seeds. Roberts book does not go into nearly as much genetic detail as Dr. D'Angieri's ATLAS or John Coborn's PROFESSIONAL BOOK OF LOVEBIRDS but it is accessible, and it includes many beautiful photographs (many of them black and white), and a great deal of information about breeding. The book is a little bit older than the two mentioned above, but the information included is not dated. I gave my granddaughter Anne Appleyard's THE LOVEBIRD HANDBOOK, a newer publication that covers everything a 12-year old needs to know.<br /><br />Roberts includes an annotated list of other books on Lovebirds in the last pages of the book but as his book was published in 1983, publications printed since then won't be included, such as Ann Appleyard's LOVEBIRD HANDBOOK which I have found very helpful.	2005-06-15

Dr. Alessandro D'Angieri, a Brazilian physician with an interest in ornithology, is a researcher at the State University of Campinas's Zoology Department (UNICAMP) who has dedicated his life to the study and preservation of Brazilian and foreign birds. His deep interest in genetic diversity  is reflected in this text devoted to the 262 species and 63 genera of the family Psittacidae and subfamily Psittacinae known as Agapornis.<br /><br />Agapornis form nine distinct forms in the wilds of continental Africa and the coastal region of the island of Madagascar.  Dr. D'Angieri includes a map showing the original homeland of these little birds, many of them threatened by the encroachment of humans, who range across an area  just South of the Equator. The book also includes hundreds of beautiful photos indicating the identity of these confusing little creatures.<br /><br />Apparently, the coloring of companion birds here in the States is the result of lots of cross-breeding around the world.  I certainly cannot keep it all straight even after perusing Dr D'Angieri's book, let alone know whether a particular type is caused by hybridization, mutation or metabolic disorder. Color in the diet does not appear to affect the color of the birds, although a healthy diet will certainly improve their feather coloration. .<br /><br />I raise Agapornis otherwise known as Lovebirds and include several Personata and Roseacollis types in my collection. Two of my Personata companions include a pair of Cobalt blue-black masked twins. According to the author, this coloration  is not common.  Using Dr. D'Angieri's book I have been able to identify the coloration of several other birds, but this is an incredibly complex book so the photographs are very important and if a picture of a particular type does not exist, I cannot identify it at all.<br /><br />I enjoyed this obviously professional book immensely, even if it includes more material than I can hold in my head, and will use it as a reference.

HERBAL VOICES, by Kathleen Dougherty is the book to read if you are looking for a way to familiarize yourself with herbalists as well as their practices and history. Dougherty interviewed dozens of American herbalists, asking them salient questions such as \\"How did you become a herbalist?, What is the nature of your remedies?\\", and \\"How do you think science enters into the equation?\\"  The first 100 pages of this book form a summary of her findings and conclusions, and the remainder is a distillation of 20 selected interviews.<br /><br />I found Dougherty's book enlightening because it discusses the role of science (experimental) in conjunction with the traditional use of herbs for healing and/or preserving health (experiential). Holistic herbalists deal with areas science cannot address because science is linear and never proves anything. Science can only suggest with a certain degree of confidence that such and such is \\"likely\\" to be connected or that selected events are correlated - and do this only if the thing being observed or studied can be subjected to a clinical trial or something equivalent.<br /><br />Holistic practitioners, on the other hand, do not view the Body-Mind-Spirit as three distinct entities that can be analyzed separately. They also generally follow the guidance of a particular tradition handed down from `wise elders' who preserved the cumulative wisdom of the ages. Along with what to obtain and how to use it, these wise elders have passed along shamanistic rituals that work with the whole person.<br /><br />The Holistic herbalist considers the role of the individual human spirit in health. Holistic practitioners also practice a \\"hands on\\" approach, that involves touching in the form of massage or healing hands. Furthermore, herbalists generally do not use their herbal products like medicine dispensed at a pharmacy. For example, if you take Echinacea to do it in the most effective way you must take it in a certain manner, which does not necessarily mean popping denatured tablets purchased at a Natural Food Store in your mouth every day. The naturalistic viewpoint suggests that whole herbs you grew and processed yourself with love are the best way to go, and these products must be handled with care. Growing your own herbs and learning to make tinctures, salves and other products is the best way of all - and don't forget to give thanks to the Source.<br /><br />This is an excellent, well written book and a must for anyone who seeks to understand these healers and their practices.s not necessarily mean popping denatured tablets purchased at a Natural Food Store in your mouth every day.

Is it my imagination, or is DCI Banks beginning to resemble Morse in some ways?  In recent novels he has become more of a loner, despite his passing involvements with different women.  And, speaking of women, Banks does have his problems.  Long time and recently ex-girlfriend Annie puts in an appearance in this novel as do other characters known to devoted readers.<br /><br />The crimes in this book are mostly resolved with police procedures, so it isn't one of those \\"warm cosy mysteries\\" I love so much, but Robinson, unlike some of his contemporaries (American mystery writers are worse) includes no gratuitous violence or sex in this novel, making it something I can read before bedtime.<br /><br />The plot is complex with more than one crime and more than one criminal, although in the beginning, the police think a serial killer may be loose.  The moral of the story is that women should not go driving late at night, especially alone and on deserted roads - stick to the Interstate or Motorv way as the case may be.<br /><br />The locus of action is a family planning agency, where late night events are suspicious.  The mystery revolves around \\"late girls\\".  Are they late with their period, late in their pregnancy or late at night?  Annie and Banks soon get to the bottom of the mystery with the help of many other police officers.<br /><br />What I like about Robinson's book is the following: 1) the editor did not Americanize the text so that we have SOCO not CSI teams, and people are \\"collected\\" not \\"picked up.\\"  If I want to read American slang, I have Stephanie Plum Thank You. Also, Robinson is allowed to write in a somewhat literate manner.  Why must editors assume folks who like mysteries are illiterate? Why can't leaves susurrate? - Hey some of us remember our Latin!! Another thing I like about Robinson's writing is the development of female characters.  He may be the first male mystery writer I've read whose females I can appreciate (the title says it all).

I planted Cistus Ladanifer `Paladin' otherwise known as the Rock Rose in my garden this past fall and since then have discovered that this may be the original Rose of Sharon mentioned in various ancient texts.  Now I read in ESSENTIAL OILS by Julia Lawless that `Labanum', which is used to make perfume, is none other than Cistus or the European Rock Rose. But Paracelsus called Laudanum which had a somewhat unsavory reputation in the 19th century (an opium derivative used by addicts to heighten the effect of alcohol) Labdanum which heightens my interest even more.<br /><br />No, Lawless hasn't written another Dale Pender-like book on \\"How to get high on your own grass\\".

As I migrate further and further into the world of herbs and essential oils and learn more and more, I have discovered hydrosols.  What, you may ask is a hydrosol?  Quoting Kurt Schnaubelt's book MEDICAL AROMATHERAPY, which suggests aromatic hydrolsols are the product of the steam distillation process used to produce essential oils, Jeanne Rose, author of 375 ESSENTIAL OILS AND HYDROSOLS says the word comes from the Latin `hydro' meaning water and `sol' meaning (collidal) solution. Sol is also the name of the old Egyptian sun god and the root of the word solace, which hydrosols can provide along with their brethren the essential oils and herbs.<br /><br />Rose includes photographs of a hydrosol still or `old spirit well' used to distill essential oil and hydrosols. In olden times these powerful substances were known as `sprits' owing to their magical properties and ability to heal and provide comfort as well as kill. Sol was also the name the alchemists gave gold.  Was it gold the alchmists sought? After all, fluids that could cure as well as maim or kill must have been worth their weight in gold.<br /><br />Rose says hydrolsols are being produced in the California wine country by wineries involved in The Aromatic Plant Project which sets an example for sustainable agriculture and respect for the environment. One of the things I best like about this book is that Rose discusses the habitat and environmental impact of each plant used to produce a specific oil/hydrosol.  For example, if you use Rosewood (Aniba rosaeodora) as a single or a blend, you are contributing to the destruction of the Brazilian rainforest, because wild trees in the forest must be destroyed to produce the Rosewood  hydrosol/oil. On the other hand, you can go on using Frankincense (Boswellia carterii) without a care because the economies of Somaliland and Southeast Arabia produce this 5,000 year-old substance (used by the Egyptians to mummify bodies) in an environmentally friendly and agriculturally sustainable manner. For each oil/hydrosol verbotan for \\"green\\" reasons, Rose suggest an alternative substance.<br /><br />In her appendix, Rose provides a list of sources (2000), including the Aromatherapy Plant Project in California (a non-profit resource that promotes American agriculture).anner.

Catty thinks these substances are as effective as oils, tisanes, and other plant-based remedies.<br /><br />HYDROSOLS: THE NEXT AROMA THERAPY includes a good deal of information about the beginning of the use of hydrosols and a discussion about water.  Good clean water is in demand and growing scarcer every day. In years to come a growing share of the world's population will not have access to clean water.  Because humans are 60-70 percent water, and totally dependent on the stuff, this is a crises. Catty suggests good water, in addition to being a life-source, can also be medicine when combined with plant substances.<br /><br />A large section of the book discusses specific hydrosols, rthe water products which form as a by-product during essential oil production (i.e. healthful water derivatives). In a section entitled `The Monographs' Catty covers specific information discovered by researchers about the properties and some applications of hydrosols. Here Catty is concerned with the chemical makeup as well as various phases of hydrosol production. Temperature, filter quality and water source all play a role in the end product(production and storage).<br /><br />In subsequent chapters she goes into more depth, covering uses of hydrosols: as compresses; sitz baths and regular baths; topical compresses such as masks, scrubs, and compresses; and shampoos, conditioners and rinses.

May 2005, the Smithsonian Magazine ran an article by Michael Balter, about the subject of his new work, THE GODDESS AND THE BULL.  Having now read the article and Balter's book about the ancient archeological site known as Catalh&ouml;y&uuml;k, I can say the book title is catchy but a bit misleading. If you are looking for evidence of Goddess worship at Catalh&ouml;y&uuml;k, you won't hear much about the topic from the current dig participants, according to Balter. Even though the dig web site apparently boasts an image of \\"her\\" and contemporary excavators have uncovered dozens of little female figurines similar to those found many years ago by James Mellaart, who made the site famous when he arrived at the opposite conclusion - that the inhabitants honored a Goddess, the current excavators consider \\"her\\" a joke.<br /><br />Catalh&ouml;y&uuml;k lies in South-Central Turkey due east of Hacilar, which Mellaart also excavated at one point in his distinguished career. Ian Hodder, the current director of the Catalh&ouml;y&uuml;k \\"dig\\" was allowed to reopen the site years after Mellaart's ignominious and unfair removal by the Turkish government - largely owing to politics. When Hodder and company arrived at the site they found the \\"south\\" area Mellaart and his team had excavated in the 1960s had become badly eroded and overgrown with vegetation, so the new team has mostly concentrated it's efforts on a more northerly area of the 32 acre site in addition to cleaning up the old excavation as they went along.<br /><br />Mellaart described Catalh&ouml;y&uuml;k as \\"Neolithic\\" - which in the 1960s was identified as the period in human history when human settlement became associated with the invention of agriculture and the domestication of animals.  According to Balter both the concept and the operational definition of this term remain unresolved (which came first settlements or agriculture?) and archeologists like Hodder dispute its traditional use.<br /><br />Much occurred over the intervening years to separate the efforts of Mellaart and Hodder. First, the new Archeology was born, then the \\"new\\" variant was revised into a newer archeology led by Hodder. Balter describes this newer archeology as practiced by the current crop of excavators and specialists working at  Catalh&ouml;y&uuml;k as `post-processual' archeology making everything that went before `processual'. Balter spends about one third of the book trying to explain Hodder's academic stance and how it differs from other archeological positions, as he, a travel-writer and journalist, understands it. He drops references to Levi-Strauss, Marx, and other scholars without really discussing why their thoughts were important to Hodder (He may not know, but he obviously believes Hodder is the \\"good guy\\" in his squabble with the \\"establishment). Another annoying tic of Balther's is his continuous use of the adjective \\"feminist\\" to describe many of the female participants in the current dig as if this it is relevant (if it is why?).<br /><br />It was not until I moved into the later stages of his tale (Balther is called the \\"project biographer\\" by the team at  Catalh&ouml;y&uuml;k) that I began to recall discussions in structural anthropology classes about the `synchronic' and `diachronic' and \\"taking each case as it comes\\", i.e. not using the dynamics of an old case to explain a new case.\\" At that point, I thought I began to understand what Balter was trying to say Hodder was thinking and saying and doing (maybe I don't, if so I am in good company, apparently).<br /><br />According to Balter, archeologists became concerned with \\"how do we know what we know\\" in the 1970s and 1980s (sociologists have long grappled with this concern -- French ethnographers like Levi-Strauss consider(ed) themselves 'sociologists'). The problem can be expressed as: whenever you perceive something what you see (your perception) is influenced by your \\"categories of understanding\\" or \\"world view\\" or \\"classificatory system\\" to use the phrase I learned when I studied with a student of Rodney Needham. These preconceptions influence how you interpret \\"facts\\" or \\"do science\\".

Growing herbs has been a passion for a while, and in recent years, because I live in an urban area on a small parcel of land, I have planted more and more herbs in pots, until my pots line the patio and sunny patches along the major walkways around my house. Over time, I've also managed to purchase several monographs and larger books on herb growing and growing edibles in containers and built a useful `herb garden' library. My all-time favorite herb-container book is still HERBS IN POTS by Rob Proctor and David Macke, because it includes many beautiful photographs of herbal arrangements in a variety of unusual containers, as well as plenty of practical herb information.<br /><br />However, if you are just beginning to grow herbs, or if you have been growing herbs a while, but forget what you planted and why you planted it, as I sometimes do, you may also want a virtual encyclopedia with big pictures and text descriptions of individual herbs to help you sort it out - a sort of identity parade if you will. Or, perhaps you don't know what to plant given your situation - there are so many choices and some may be more suitable after all. You will want to purchase the BBG GOURMET HERBS monograph to help you deal with choice and confusion.  In addition, the BBG monograph includes a short history of herbs and their origins (Asia, America, Africa..) as well as touching on practical (medicinal, culinary) as well as aesthetic applications, and provides a quick overview of various `herb garden' designs you might consider (Western European, Southwestern/Mexican, Mediterranean). Because this is a BBG product it includes a practical section on growing herbs.  The BBG monograph is a great addition to your garden library.	2005-05-13

I haven't always gardened on a small urban lot, but even in the city trees present a challenge. One side of our house is given over to rusticity. Here we stash much of the plant material from pruned shrubs and dead foliage as well as leftover mulch delivered by our county as part of the `Black Gold' program. Over time, some of the dead plants have renewed themselves in this little \\"wilderness\\" either because a not quite dead root found nourishment, or seeds sprouted.  As a result, I decided a few years ago I needed to assist the site and make it a `woodsy' niche.<br /><br />The first thing we did was fight the ivy, which is so tenacious. After I pull it, I hang it over the fence to dry (as well as pull it from the fence, which my unknowing neighbors never do). Next, we purposely amended the soil using mulch from the city program. Then we made sure the bushes and shrubs and the trees were pruned to let in a little light. Next,  we added  `civilized' plants such as a Camellia,  Hellebores, Tiarella, Violets, Arum Lily, Hosta, Spring bulbs including Scilla, which makes a nice appearance as \\"blue bells\\" in spring, and other denizens of the woodlands identified in the BBG WOODLAND GARDENS.<br /><br />We did this the hard way, learning in dribs and drabs, but you have a choice. You can purchase a book from the BBG that covers all the angles on gardening in woodlands (well, as much as you need to get started -- my only complaint is that the entry on invasive plants is pathetic). In a series of articles by respected garden writers, the BBG monograph includes sections covering `Woodlands Ecology', Woodlands Gardens' and Woodland Plants'. Authors include Colston Burrell, a well known garden designer on the East Coast (and the editor of this monograph) and Daniel Hinckly, who is associated with Heronswood Nursery on the West Coast. The various woodlands gardens range from \\"real\\" woodlands at the edge of a \\"clearing\\" to tree planted areas constructed in urban areas. The section covering plants is divided into regions, and the `Mid-Atlantic' is split from the `Northeast' and the `Deep South', of which it is both.section covering plants is divided into regions, and the `Mid-Atlantic' is split from the `Northeast' and the `Deep South', of which it is both.   <br />	2005-05-13

A POMPEIAN HERBAL was published in 1999, a few short years after THE GARDENS OF POMPEII, HERCULANEUM, AND THE VILLAS DESTROYED BY VESUVIUS, which Jashemski co-edited with Frederick Meyer -- and a masterpiece on this topic and era -- was published.<br /><br />The Pompeii Herbal demonstrates that medicinal plants have been around thousands of years, and in use until modern petrochemical compounds came on the scene. Furthermore, when Jashemski was working at Pompeii, she discovered the locals around and near Pompeii continued to use medicinal plants noted by the Romans, demonstrating yet again that herbal medicine and homeopathic remedies in use to day are not new. The book includes an informative text about ancient Roman medicinal uses of plants, many lovely photos of the work site and micron photos of seeds, pollens, etc.,  as well as illustrations of the noted plants.<br /><br />I discovered reading Jashemski's book that many of the plants used by the ancient Romans grow in my own back yard or in pots - under my care of course, as they are not native to my area: Artemesia, Calamintha nepeta (cat mint), Centranthus ruber, Citrus limon. Foeniculum vulgare (Fennel) and Petroselinum crispum (Parsley) to name a few.	2005-05-11

I bought this book used because I wanted to compare the BBG CHILE PEPPER book with other pepper books and the price was right. I have a confession. I never eat peppers. I can grow anything that smacks of capsicum, but I don't even like the smell of green peppers on pizza. Okay, I make chili and do it the right way with several tablespoons of ground chili pepper, and I eat plenty of Asian food including various dishes with pepper, and I love Salsa, but I avoid items on the menu with the little chili pepper (Szechewan, \\"hot\\" Thai) and I no longer eat Black Pepper because it makes me sneeze. My son-in-law pops whole peppers in his mouth - right off the plant, and the hotter the better. He scoffs at Scoville units, and he's teaching the bolder of my granddaughters to engage in the same crass behavior. I know that Capsicum helps relieve pain, so he should feel no pain this summer. I prefer my Capsicum in tablet form or as an ointment.<br /><br />I grow peppers because they are so pretty and easy to grow. I place them in clay pots and line the driveway. I take the tall purple and black varieties and lace the perennial beds. I use them as the \\"fill\\" in potted arrangements. Peppers make great accent plants, and they can handle drought in hot summer. In fact, they love drought. Apparently, the more drought the better the pepper. The BBG CHILE PEPPERS monograph includes a section on growing `Small Chiles and Ornamentals', but it's very short, lacks photos and is not terribly helpful for those who would like to enhance their garden plots.  I found Rosilind Creasy's EDIBLE PEPPER GARDEN more helpful.<br /><br />The BBG CHILE PEPPER book is filled with recipes for main dishes, pepper dishes and salsas and vinegars, and shows you how roasted peppers should look before you whip them into a salsa.<br /><br />I like the book because it is short and to the point with lots of photos. As a gardener, I find it more cook book than anything else, although it includes the inevitable section on pests and diseases. I am always puzzled by this, because the least of my concerns with peppers are pests and diseases. In fact pepper can be used as an insect deterrant..

I began growing herbs several years ago, and like many folks in this area bought herb plants from Thomas DeBaggio when he ran his nursery from an old (family) farm house in North Arlington (before his unfortunate demise at the hands of Alzheimer's Disease). Intrigued with these plants I began to read about them, take courses dedicated to this subject, and gain a lot of practical hands-on experience growing them.<br /><br />Moving on from books, I have begun to subscribe to a number of periodicals devoted to this topic including the above mentioned HERB COMPANION.  This 'slick' magazine of about 60-65 pages, seems to be dedicated to the culinary herbs moreso than medicinal or other kinds of herbs. The editors apparently are not as knowledgeable about food and children as they might be including an article prescribing honey in Chamomile for a child with a sick tummy one month only to have to reverse themselves the next month after a subscriber writes a letter suggesting this might not be a good idea as some honey carries botulism.  I suspect next month another subscriber will write in and suggest pasteurized honey is okay.<br /><br />Perhaps they are just getting off the ground, entering a somewhat enthusiastic market, but you might also try reading the HERB QUARTERLY which seems to carry somewhat scientifically based information.	2005-05-01

One of the more frustrating aspects of Patricia Telesco's,  THE HERBAL ARTS, is her failure to organize the herbs by their Latin names (she provides a Latin name with each entry, but many of these entries have been reclassified since the book was published or are not very well explained). This shortcoming makes shopping for a specific herb difficult, as the more reputable plant suppliers rely on Latin names to organize their inventories. Although some plant catalogs group plants by colloquial names, if you are seeking a specific plant for a particular ailment, the search may prove confusing without the exact identifier, and the plant you finally select may be ineffective at best and dangerous at worst. (For example,  the Bergamot that gives Earl Grey Tea its distinctive scent is probably the essential oil (Citrus bergamia) which comes from Asia, not the flower in my perennial bed (Beebalm or Monarda didyma sometimes known as Oswego Tea) native to the Eastern US, or Monarda citriodora the Lemon Bergamot native to the US West. Telesco does not discuss Bergamot, which might be just as well,  but she also fails to mention Oregano (Origanum -- sometimes known as wintersweet or Majoram. She mentions the latter, but not all Oreganos are Oreganum majorana so she needs a crossreference as a minimum).<br /><br />As I mentioned, the author almost always provides one Latin name per entry, however, often several different species names are often involved. For example, \\"marigolds\\" are listed as Marigolds or Calendula in her book, not Tagetes, which is how many botanists classify them. If you want to add Marigold to soup or use it to rinse your hair, you probably want Calendula Officinalis.  But if you want to deter nematodes in the garden, you want Tagetes. Similarly, Chamomile may be Chamomile or Matricaria - one an annual and the other a perennial (the annual is thought to taste better).  Tarragon may be Artemisia or Tagetes, which takes us back to Marigolds.<br /><br />Other than horticultural confusion and lacunae, this book includes some interesting \\"spiritual\\" claims, but I have not read the ancients, so I do not know which herbs were preferred by which Gods and Goddesses or Spirits, with the exception of Asclepias who left little doubt, and Venus with her Dittany (Oreganum dictamnus) who is pictured at Pompeii bringing the wonder drug to the wounded Aeneas (I know this from other sources).<br /><br />Apparently Ms Telesco located various reputable and questionable sources that link various flora with ancient deities, so her claims are not unfounded. She provides a comprehensive bibliography, though I would have preferred to have seen footnotes linking her sources with her text. The book includes no photos or drawings to help the confused. You would do better to lay out the $$ and purchase the Van Wyck and Wink book on MEDICINAL PLANTS OF THE WORLD.al confusion and lacunae, this book includes some interesting \\"spiritual\\" claims, but I have not read the ancients, so I do not know which herbs were preferred by which Gods and Goddesses or Spirits, with the exception of Asclepias who left little doubt, and Venus with her Dittany (Oreganum dictamnus) who is pictured at Pompeii bringing the wonder drug to the wounded Aeneas (I know this from other sources).

In THE TAROT OF THE GREEN WITCH, Ann Moura uses the paradigm known as \\"The Wheel of the Year' to organize and explain her interpretation of the cards of the major and minor arcana. If you are not familiar with the `Wheel of the Year' or basic Tarot concepts, you may find this book less than helpful. Even if you are familiar, you may note that here is yet another explanation of an ancient set of cards with an origin shrouded in the mist of time.  These days, authors seldom provide citations and Moura is no exception, so I was only able to follow her comments about the various interpretations because I have assembled and read a library on this topic, as well as having various occult experiences.<br /><br />Whether you accept Margaret Starbird's exposition linking the Tarot with an archaic Gnostic catechism, or Isabel Kliegman's interpretation which ties the Minor Arcana to the Kabbalah, or you accept a Jungian explanation, you will probably enjoy reading Moura's book.<br /><br />Moura says she is not interested in the \\"Fire versus Air' argument for Swords and Wands or the reversal of the `Strength' and `Justice' cards in the Waite-Ryder deck produced by the Order of the New Dawn. Nor is she interested in which interpretation of the `Wheel of the Year' is \\"correct\\". She provides compelling reasons as to why she believes most experts agree the Tarot is not of European origin, and may in fact have originated in India, traveling west via Romania (Which in my mind makes no difference as the origin is \\"Indo-European\\" and thus the argument put forward by Rachel Pollock and Joseph Campbell regarding an association between the Tarot and the ancient near East is not disproved) .<br /><br />Moura does not view Tarot cards as useful for \\"fortune telling\\", but rather she says they are for divination, which is a different matter.  Fortune telling implies predestination, and if we have free will, which she believes we do, then events are not immutable or fixed. Divination implies future outcomes which can be affected.<br /><br />I found this book both informative and helpful, and while I may not agree with every last aspect, I recommend it to anyone who has moved beyond the basic interpretations and wants to explore further. If you want a basic volume, check out Rachel Pollack's book SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM.on implies future outcomes which can be affected. <br /> <br />I found this book both informative and helpful, and while I may not agree with every last aspect, I recommend it to anyone who has moved beyond the basic interpretations and wants to explore further.

So you want to turn your big back yard into a wildlife refuge?  The place to begin is with the NWF `ATTRACTING BIRDS, BUTTERFLIES AND OTHER BACKYARD WILDLIFE.' This book, part of the `Creative Homeowner Series includes all kinds of nifty ideas for making your yard creature-friendly. You will become interested in ridding yourself of noxious grass the upkeep of which is frustrating, a lot of work, and expensive, and probably a source of pollution in your watershed.  The book explains the reason why you also want to rid yourself of invasive exotic plants and add native plantings to your yard.  Many `exotics carry disease and many fail to nourish the local fauna that grew up with the native stuff.  Birds, for example, find the berries from the native Dogwood much more nutritious than the fruit of the Kousa Dogwood.  You want to strive for balance in your yard if you want more bird sightings.  If you live far enough out in the hinterland, you may also find other creatures visit your yard (though I live in Arlington VA and my neighbor reports a raccoon is having a fish dinner every night from her pond, and I know I have smelled a skunk on many mornings).<br /><br />The beautiful photos in this publication will inspire you to plan and plant as well as spread peanut butter on your homemade `energy muffins' filled with cornmeal, peanuts and suet or vegetable shortening.  You can decorate a Yule tree for the birds the kids might enjoy and/or build a pond with decorative plants.  Or if you don't have room for a pond, try making a puddle or a muddy area (the kids will love this) or a container garden for small spaces.  You will need to provide cover, which can also be beautiful (we have Cardinals nesting in a Pyracantha bush out front -- my Conure loves to watch them from his window vantage point). We planted Clematis for the butterflies and trumpet flowers for the hummingbirds, and Echinacea for the Finches. The Chickadee loves seeds on the Crepe Myrtle Bush and the Mockingbird loves the Holly.<br /><br />This is a great book for learning how to attract wildlife (the kind you want) and grow native flora for your fauna, as well as engage in fun activities with your kids or grandkids.bird loves the Holly. <br /> <br />This is a great book for learning how to attract wildlife (the kind you want) and grow native flora for your fauna, as well as engage in fun activities with your kids or grandkids.	2005-04-24

If you buy nothing else for your gardening home library, buy monographs from a responsible organization such as the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.  THE NATURAL WATER GARDEN, published in 1997 and again in 2000, is an excellent example of the quality of material you can expect from this fine source.<br /><br />Now you may think you don't need a book like this because you live in the city or suburbs and have no nearby pond or stream you could dam up to make a pond.  You would be wrong with that assumption.  I live on a small urban plot and have managed to have a water garden and if I can do it you can too.<br /><br />Those of us who subscribe to the BBC TV network remember a fine (apparently no longer extant) series called `Ground Force'.  Every week this team would overhaul someone's garden and without fail, they would find a way to install a `water feature'.  Usually these projects were relatively simple because most of the gardens the team revamped were small urban entities. Once in a while the team would take on a larger project (they once overhauled Nelson Mandela's patch in South Africa, which is how I discovered the Nile Lily).  Usually, they dug a hole, lined it with a water-proof liner, trimmed it with stones, and then filled it with various water plants.  Once in a while they did something different such as make a water garden in a pot.<br /><br />The BG guide shows you how to create larger and smaller water features, be they bog gardens, soil erosion projects, or marshes, or pools, or ponds.  My favorite chapter is the `storm water marsh, because I have yet to live anywhere in the South where water does not come down in torrents and cascade from the roof in a `downpour'. Our current house was no exception. I say \\"was\\" because we used a number of ideas found in this little monograph to convert the runoff for good purposes.  Where water once washed off the house and under it, it now moves out to the yard and under the patio, and collects in the far corner of the back yard, where Viburnum, Aronia, Holly, Hibiscus, Japanese Anemone, Iris, Hosta, Ajuga and Hyacinth congregate and thrive.<br /><br />The Guide mentions Prince Georges County in Maryland as an example of a jurisdiction that promotes building a storm water marsh to reduce the effect of sudden surges in the flow of water which cause flooding in lowlands and damage the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Although I live across the river in Arlington on higher ground, my county is very Green and promotes similar eco-friendly behavior.  The upshot is that you may find buying this little book and using it as a guide may be an act of responsible citizenship.of the back yard, where Viburnum, Aronia, Holly, Hibiscus, Japanese Anemone, Iris, Hosta, Ajuga and Hyacinth congregate and thrive.  <br /> <br />The Guide mentions Prince Georges County in Maryland as an example of a jurisdiction that promotes building a storm water marsh to reduce the effect of sudden surges in the flow of water which cause flooding in lowlands and damage the Chesapeake Bay watershed.

In the past few years, I have become more interested in herbal remedies and essential oils.  Although I have obtained a few good books from the essential oil sources concerning their products, I have also taken the time to investigate and cross-reference material from other sources.  Hence, my purchase of MEDICINAL PLANTS by Ben-Erik van Wyk and Michael Wink.  While Rodale's book on Herbs provided me with information about how to grow selected plants, and THE REFERENCE GUIDE FOR ESSENTIAL OILS by Connie and Alan Higley explained how to apply the oils - make infusions and/or nebulize oils, MEDICINAL PLANTS provides information about the botany of these plants as well as a history of their various applications within the framework of health systems such as `Aromatherapy', `Homeopathy', and traditional medicine -- Chinese, Ayurvedic, or something else.<br /><br />You will sometimes hear it said, probably by disingenuous spokespersons for international Pharmaceutical and/or Petro-Chemical companies or their ilk, that nontraditional treatments such as the application of essential oils is dangerous because the most of the oils, herbs, etc. have not been \\"government tested\\".  The truth is, most have been tested, just not perhaps by the US FDA (some have been \\"officially\\" tested, but many carry GRAS or \\"generally regarded as safe\\" ID, many have been found safe and efficacious in Europe or Canada). In addition, traditional medicines from China and India represent thousands of years of testing though trial and error and outcome. Some of these remedies are so old you will never discover their origin while the origins of others are well known. Lastly, not everything is known about many \\"modern\\" medicines which are generally subjected to shorter periods of inquiry before they are released for commerce.<br /><br />Now, this does not mean you should use any old plant wily-nily.  Of course not. And, these authors recommend you seek professional help in the form of a traditional healer before you apply a tincture, ointment, etc. made with a natural product. But books like this volume by a reputable European source are a good place to begin educating yourself.  Some plants have known side effects and some can kill. \\"Fortunately\\", the authors write, \\"herbal drugs or botanical(s) have a large therapeutic window between the `effective' dose and the `toxic' dose.\\"<br /><br />Plants can be sources for vitamins and minerals, sports medicine, and food.  It may surprise you to learn that many so-called \\"modern\\" medicines have a natural basis (aspirin and digitalis, to name but two). Perusing this book, I was surprised to see how many of these medicinal plants I grow in my own yard. This beautiful book includes about 325 pages of color photos and text depicting and describing various plants and plant parts with 1-2 entries per page. In the back you will find an index linking traditional medicines and ailments and a `Quick Guide to Commercialised Medicinal Plants\\" which will tell you among other things that `Modern Medicine' has appropriated a number of traditional plant sources for its own uses.l healer before you apply a tincture, ointment, etc. made with a natural product.

What is the `Veil'? Willow Polson writes.  Various religious tracts speak of a dividing line between \\"our\\" world and the \\"other world\\" but no one operationally defines what is meant by these terms. Polson does not decide which operational or religious definition best describes the veil or the other world, but she believes they exist. She says this world is based on `consensual reality*\\" and the veil is a curtain of unknowing which separates our consensual reality from the other world which mere mortals might understand better by cross-referencing each others' experiences of breaking through to the other side.<br /><br />*One example of consensual reality for Westerners is an acceptance that the sky is blue. (Even though shots from space show it is dark and void and anthropologists report that some traditional folks see a \\"white\\" sky).<br /><br />Polson suggests because consensual reality is an illusion, no human being knows what is absolute. All anyone can know is what one experiences as he or she travels a spiritual path.  How we interpret information acquired through living on this plane is shaped by cognitive structures and categories of understanding framed by social and cultural experience.  Remaining `open to other possibilities' involves modification of these preconditions and a willingness to engage in a new kind of `seeing'.<br /><br />Owing to the nebulous nature of the veil and the two realities it divides, Polson acknowledges she can but share her own experiences of penetrating it.

When Mary Riley Smith's THE FRONT GARDEN was published in 1991, it became an instant hit with me.  Other writers have jumped into the subject since then, but Riley's book retains the freshness of relatively new and creative original ideas.  I began my front garden over 20 years ago, when we moved into a seven-year old house here in Arlington that sat back from the street on a narrow lot.  The front yard is much bigger than the back yard, and it pained me to see all the wasted space.  The front yard received much sunlight, the back is in shade.  Anyone with a desire to grow most of the perennials available in these times knows, that most of them do better in sunshine.<br /><br />So, when the dogwood badly planted in the hot sun succumbed to borers, to the amazement of our conventional neighbors, we rototilled the front yard and created a huge swath of flowers and shrubs.  I used many of the ideas in my own head (for better or worse) until I found Smith's book.<br /><br />Although \\"only\\" a paperback, the book includes many stunning photos of gardens in the front yard--along driveways, beside houses, next to porches.  Best of all Smith includes some simplistic designs (what every new gardener needs) showing various plants for your geometric or herb or vegetable garden.  Did I say vegetable?  Yes, indeedy.  I grow hot peppers, beans, and last year melons in raised beds.  We have a terraced garden made from timbers sitting in the middle of the front yard where you are likely to see tulips in the spring and beans later on. This year, if you pass by, you will see purple peppers in the petunias (ornamental veggies are the \\"in\\" plant).<br /><br />I've noticed over the years that my neighbors are filling in their wasted spaces (front yards) with flowers and veggies.  The kindest comments of all come from the passersby who stop to admire the garden and go away with a smile. One woman said \\"Thank you for opening up your garden to the street.\\"	2005-04-12

I bought this older used book (1996) and find it remains quite relevant.  One of the reasons we gardeners end up planting invasive species is because they are easy to grow.  In EASY CARE NATIVE PLANTS Patricia Taylor addresses one of the biggest issues for gardeners... \\"I would grow native species, but I don't have time.\\"<br /><br />Well, Taylor suggests low maintenance creatures that will be no more work than the invasive plants you intended to install. With Taylor, we visit public and private gardens where individuals are making a difference one plant at a time.  From these gardeners, we learn how to construct various gardens including a woodlands garden, a drought tolerant native garden, and a front yard native garden.  Taylor provides lists of plants for each of these gardens.  For a complementary book, you might consider buying both Taylor's book and 100 EASY-TO-GROW NATIVE PLANTS by Lorraine Johnson which is a kind of annotated plant directory (although it focuses mainly on non-woody plants, whereas Taylor includes trees, shrubs and plants).  Alternatively, you can contact the US Fish and Wildlife Service for a free monograph on plant invaders and substitutes at [...] Do that and you are sure to find 'Celastrus orbiculatus' or Oriental Bittersweet on the \\"No-no\\" list. Also the latter monograph suggests several native alternatives to bittersweet, such as 'Campsis radicans' (trumpet vine) and 'Passiflora incarnata' or Passion Vine.	2005-04-03

When I was a little girl, my fourth grade teacher Mrs. Bryant took our class on a walking field trip.  We hiked from the school to a nearby creek that actually ran through a woods behind my home. There on a bank (or several banks for that matter), we found the plants we had been studying, NC flora-trilliums, mandrakes, jack-in-the-pulpit and others.  I haven't seen these plants in the wild in a long time. The reason of course is that my old haunts have become unrecognizable as developers plowed under miles and miles land between High Point and Thomasville, and Winston Salem and Salisbury--farms when I was a kid. With the destruction of these farms, went creeks, bogs, hedgerows and other wonderful places native plants thrived. `Like the dew on the mountain, like the bubble on the fountain...lost and gone forever....'<br /><br />100 EASY TO GROW NATIVE PLANTS by Lorraine Johnson is about these native American plants systematically destroyed by the forces of change, including the invasion of foreign plants such as English Ivy (Hedera helix) and Asian and European privet. There are alternatives. Instead of English Ivy you can plant Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia). At the headquarters of Museum of Garden History at Lambeth Place in London, Virginia Creeper grows on the old church that serves as the museum and tumbles across the small cemetery that houses the Tradescants and Captain Bligh of Bounty fame (also a great plantsman). Unlike the evergreen English ivy, Virginia creeper loses its leaves in winter and thus moisture does not collect under the leaves and destroy masonry. (I ripped it off my house because I thought it would lift the shingles).  In addition, the creeper leaves turn a bright red in the fall...so, when you see those lovely fall photos of old houses in England and notice the red leaves on the facades,  remind yourself \\"That is a Native American plant.\\"<br /><br />Johnson does not really cover the list of invasive plants you might wish to displace with native substitutes but you need to know their names.

Tracy DiSabato-Aust's THE WELL TENDED PERENNIAL GARDEN covers a subject dear to the heart of most gardeners.  Perennials are wonderful plants that come in all sizes, shapes, colors, floral displays, and height and can be used in borders, containers, planters and hanging pots. DiSabato mostly looks at perennials as bedding material-examples grown in long borders, or in clustered garden settings near door entrances or patio seating areas.<br /><br />I found this book much more refined and useful than the author's book on garden design using perennials, trees and shrubs.  For one thing she eschews overly complicated designs while portraying results the average gardener might accomplish.  The plant arrangements are relatively straightforward and involve specimens easily found in garden catalogs or local nurseries. One photo depicts an autumn arrangement of several varieties of Chrysanthemum, Virginia Sweetspire (Itea) and Fothergilla in a perennial shot \\"to die for\\" (she slipped a few shrubs into this book).<br /><br />The author includes a good check list of perennial attributes one might observe, such as hardiness, tolerance, staking requirements and tendancy to be invasive, and then she discusses staking, deadheading and other tasks associated with the well-tended perennial garden.  DiSabato does not seem overly concerned that some of the perennials she includes in her annotated list, such as Arum lillies, may become noxious invasive weeds in some parts of the country (such as the South), but she does suggest some species varieties instead of others for good solid reasons (i.e. Arabis Procurrens instead of Arabis Caucasica).<br /><br />She covers pests and diseases of perennials in some detail, but I always find these `pest and pestilence' chapters an unnecessary downer.  You can worry yourself silly about what might happen.  In my experience, plants like children can resist many ailments if they are kept healthy, so I find it far more important to attend to their nutrition and other basic needs and forget the poisons. To her credit DiSabato agrees.  She suggests prevention is the best cure and recommends staying away from `chemicals' (a curious term as all living things are composed of chemicals, but you get the idea).

Tracy DiSabato-Aust has put a lot of herself into her complex book,  THE WELL-DESIGNED GARDEN.  This topic (design not Tracy) certainly needs addressing.  In lieu of hiring a garden designer which most new home owners cannot afford to do, new gardeners must rely on friends as well as multiple books and articles to address garden questions. Wouldn't it be nice to find a single source that covers everything-trees, shrubs, perennial identification and planting and growing specifics, as well as design issues?  I doubt this book will satisfy that need. The gardening newcomer or even somewhat seasoned gardeners will probably find this book overwhelming in its detail while remaining unhelpful in addressing specific needs.<br /><br />As the title suggests, DiSabato includes several garden design layouts, but these few designs are limited to a townhouse garden, a few 'house' patio/garden designs and the design for what appears to be large \\"estate\\", which makes her book little more than a sample portfolio of her own jobs which she probably had prepared for potential customers, and which she decided to transform into a `book'. This is not a well researched document that investigates assembles, and analyzes what a variety of garden designers have been or are doing.  Rather than a menu of suggestions about designing, this book begs the question, What does she mean by\\"well-designed\\"? Does it mean done by Tracy?  For example, if you seek information about building a small or an \\"intimate\\" garden, or dividing a larger area into many smaller gardens, you would do better to use Colston Burrell's INTIMATE GARDENS which includes a summary of examples pertaining to small garden areas  (and is a good deal less expensive).<br /><br />Preferring a minimalist approach where each and every plant is allowed to develop somewhat naturally into stunning combinations as well as preferring a palette formed along a blue-purple continuum (picture a relatively large area of Arabis punctuated with blue Scilla in the spring garden) I find DiSabato's penchant for overly busy concoctions-jumbles of hot-colored items each vying for attention- leaves me feeling unwell.  DiSabato also appears to be a Funkia-fanatic (wedded to the Hosta Lily) and fond of other common plant forms with red, orange, mustard yellow and gold blooms. Her compositions are \\"enhanced\\" with twee garden ornaments-some of which would show well if they were not in competition with their various settings. Her best shots can be found in the section of the book where she discusses color and most of these are examples from other people's gardens.<br /><br />This book is not worth the money you will pay to own it....th blue Scilla in the spring garden) I find DiSabato's penchant for overly busy concoctions-jumbles of hot-colored items each vying for attention- leaves me feeling unwell.

Although this book was published several years ago, it is still a mega-star as far as I am concerned--printed on slick glossy paper and filled with beautiful and clear photographs. The combinations I used worked for me then and they work now in my more mature garden.<br /><br />Burrell includes many suggestions for the gardener charged with developing an otherwise barren plot into a floriferous spot. Every yard is a collection of ecological zones ranging from dry loose (or compacted) soil to wet mucky bogs.  Different combinations of plants work in different circumstances.  For example, although I once had a professional gardener tell me Siberian Iris would grow anywhere, that has not been my experience, and Burrell confirms their best showing comes in a relatively damp area (Mine do best in the boggy area where our air conditioning unit drips ceaselessly throughout the summer-check out the lake in the middle of Central Park, Siberian Iris grow all along the shoreline). And speaking of  \\"wet\\" gardens, Burrell shows ferns, Hosta, flags and various other perennials who either like or can tolerate damp feet combined into a `Garden for Three Seasons.'<br /><br />Burrell covers almost any situation you can encounter in the garden: shade and wet, shade and dry, hot and dry, hot and wet.  Have you just removed a dead tree and are puzzled about what to do to disguise the residual stump? Perhaps you want to grow wild flowers and don't know how or where to begin.  Or, perhaps you have prairie-like conditions and wonder what to plant. And by the way, you don't have to live on the Great Plains to have prairie-like conditions, a sunny bank will do or, as in my case, where the driveway meets the street.<br /><br />Burrell offers many tips and \\"secrets for success\\" with whatever condition you may encounter.

INTIMATE GARDENS by Burrell and Hardiman provides tips for the gardener with a small urban space or a larger ex-urban space in need of humanizing.  These days, most gardeners are not faced with the enviable task of creating intimate spaces in an otherwise vast, undifferentiated but potential garden area.  Nevertheless, we may dream of someday owning such a spread and being faced with this challenge.  In the meantime, we can take many of the authors suggestions regarding plant selections for small spaces to heart.<br /><br />Most of this short Brooklyn Botanic Garden monograph is dedicated to \\"Furnishing an Intimate Garden\\" a large section which discusses trees and shrubs, as well as perennials, vines, and groundcovers.<br /><br />The authors include an abbreviated variant of the latest USDA zone hardiness map-showing undifferentiated or collapsed growing zones (Zone 5, 6, etc. not 5A, 5B, etc.) and state boundaries.  However the illustrations (such as the map) and the gardens and plant photos are mostly beautiful.<br /><br />Although the back cover suggests this book covers garden design, very few designs for intimate garden spaces are discussed or even pictured (not a single layout). A more comprehensive discussion about the design of intimate garden spaces, can be found in THE OUTDOOR ROOM by David Stevens so if you own that old book, this one does not update it. The Stevens book remains relatively pricey, so you may want to visit your library to check it out.  However, Stevens includes plenty of actual garden design layouts, and one or two will probably appeal to you. The Stevens book is irritatingly short on information about plant material, however, so not adequate for the task of creating intimate garden spaces.<br /><br />You will want to buy the Burrell and Hardiman book for the discussion of plant materials, but see also - Burrell's `Perennial Combinations' which does include some garden designs-although limited to perennials.	2005-03-26

About half (121 of 218 pages) of CROCHET YOUR WAY is devoted to a really beautiful Afghan you can compose of large blocks constructed of various shades and patterns of Blue OR Aubergine colored yarns.  To me this Afghan is the most beautiful I have seen in all the many years I have been constructing these things.  I like the idea of blocks.  You can go round and round and end up with some very strange concoctions when the Afghan is all of one piece, but making blocks that you then assemble is a measured, ordered process that is a bit easier to handle. Besides, you can take individual blocks with you and work on them elsewhere as they are small enough to fit in your tapestry bucket or bag.<br /><br />The blocks on CYW are not the standard 6x6\\" variations on the Granny Square. These blocks are larger --as large as you want them to be -- depending on the yarn and needles you employ, and each block is a composite of various Crochet stitches, including a few the authors introduce that they suggest seldom appear in other books.  Their Afghan is scrumptious, and the authors suggest their book is a suitable tool for teaching crochet. It very well may be, however, in my experience, students want something they can realize almost instantly, and a large project like this Afghan will take the beginner months if not years to make.<br /><br />The authors include much basic material, including instructions for making each crochet stitch using a right-handed or left-handed approach. I find this section of the book the most distracting and least helpful. While you might use the book to learn the crochet basics, I already know them, which makes me happy, because it would drive me crazy to follow their diagrams.  I would characterize this book as a \\"mostly\\" design book, however, and I remain unconvinced that design books are great books for beginners.<br /><br />The remainder of the Tracy and Levin book includes the \\"Over 40 Projects for Home and Family\\" segment.  With the exception of a bathroom rug and toliet seat cover, most of the items are articles of clothing such as chunky jackets, tunics and shawls, as well as hats to match in some cases.  I was elated to find a beret pattern reminiscent of the hat my grandmother knitted for me many years ago, I've been looking a while for this item, with no success.  I know my own granddaughters will find this hat `funky'. (It also reminds me of the hat the Johansson girl wears in the film 'The Horse Whisperer'.)<br /><br />The author also includes some smart vests for the nimble fingered. Crochet sweaters and vests can be as svelte as the knitted variety when constructed of fine yarns and smaller needles.  The short jacket on the cover is a prime example of how creative one can be with this craft of crochet. **** for design and *** for basic instructions.xception of a bathroom rug and toliet seat cover, most of the items are articles of clothing such as chunky jackets, tunics and shawls, as well as hats to match in some cases.

These beautiful vines are not invasive, and depending on the species you purchase can tolerate a variety of circumstances. Some bloom once, some in spring and fall, and some throw out a few blossoms all season. Clematis hybrids include soubles and singles as well as large-flowered and small-flowered hybrids (Lloyd covers them all), and some older types that generally have a single showing in spring and then are quiet the rest of the season.  They come in a variety of colors ranging from white to dark purple. Some Clematis are not vines at all but herbaceous non-climbing shrubs.<br /><br />Lloyd is an English gardener with a pedigree--he is considered one of the leading experts on Clematis. He has training as a horticulturist and has been gardening for a very long while.  Bennett works for an Environmental Health office and runs a Clematis nursery in Durham England.<br /><br />I have grown Clematis for years, usually in combination with a climbing rose of some kind and I recommend this book and the Clematis vine.

Older women can \\"get a life\\" if they only pause to reflect on the inner self.  Some think of aspects of the female self as archetypes or personality quirks, Bolen says they are \\"Goddesses within.\\" Although we may fail to listen, and thus not hear them, inner voices occur throughout life. Different needs as well as life-long experience evokes different voices in the older woman. Her name may be wisdom, although she is more than wisdom, she is healing, compassion, and/or mirth. You may notice her voice which called to you when you were younger now has a new tone. We worship her, whether or not we think of her as a Goddess. She has been with you since girlhood as Mary or Kuan Yin or the Shekinah. First appearing as a maiden, then when we became mothers appearing as a mother.  Now, she comes to us as a crone, the third phase of the moon-waxing-or the last aspect of the triple goddess.  Known since ancient times, although appropriated by patriarchal faiths, still known if you listen to the small still voice in your heart.<br /><br />As a 70s and 80s self-help junkie more disillusioned than ever by the US role in world events, I picked up this book-published in 2001-thinking, \\"Why am I doing this?\\" and \\"Been there, done that\\" \\"How could this apply to me\\" only to be pleasantly surprised by the delightful and helpful contents.  After all these years, Jean Shinoda Bolen still has much to share. I am recommending this book to my daughter who is aged 43.

Colston Burrell and others have developed an extremely useful guide for the early-intermediate gardener.  This book is not gardening for dummies, but neither is the content so complex the relative newcomer cannot use it. The contents consist of a compendium of pertinent topic-based articles and an approximately 100 pages (three per page) of photographs and descriptions of \\"popular\\" perennials and annuals. (Hence, the odd or unusual item may not be covered.)<br /><br />The text opens with a basic botany lesson reminiscent of the chapter you read in college Biology 101 and goes on to discuss some of the properties of selected annuals and perennials as well as bulbs which can be recurring (become naturalized) or not. The next section encourages the reader to consider where he or she is building a garden.  Aspects such as climate, terrain, sun exposure and growing zone are discussed.<br /><br />Next the authors discuss the flower garden, which most folks want to create. Various considerations such as planning and design, the layout of beds, borders and the items to fill the interstices are addressed, along with various types, such as cutting, meadow, and cottage gardens. Annuals and perennials not only present problems, they can be used for problem solving. Using the garden with various land features such as hills, shade and drought and bogs is discussed.<br /><br />When one becomes conversant with the aesthetics of the garden plot, the next step is to address the mechanics such as soil preparation, plant fit, and timing. In this arena, tool choices are critical, as well as the application of mulch and water, pruning and training your plants and facing winter requirements.  When you become skilled you will want to consider propagation not only as a cost saving measure, but a way to obtain otherwise difficult or impossible to acquire plants.<br /><br />The book closes with what I consider to be the encyclopedia portion-annotated entries for selected perennial and annuals.

Although this guide includes limited information about \\"First Steps' it is not really designed for the beginning knitter. (Among the first steps included are `Casting off Knitwise' and `Casting off Purlwise.) Although the books in this series were originally developed for a British audience, that should not prove in the least troublesome. I could follow the basic parts and I am an  aficionado of the Dummies book.<br /><br />This Volume includes much useful information about `Shaping' your garment after you create it.  Most useful to me at this juncture are the steps for increasing and decreasing. Although the book's suggestions do not look exactly like the steps my knitting instructor showed me, between the two of them I get the picture. (My instructor, I am discovering, she does things that are unique to her.)  The scarf I am making currently involves knitting on the bias or diagonal knitting, and the steps shown in this book are not identical with those shown me by my instructor, although there is an interesting note about how to effect an angle, i.e. make it sharper or less sharp, which she did not show me. `Mitred corners, gores and gussets are discussed as well as two methods (knit and purl turning) for shaping cowls and shoulders. You can learn to graft or increase and decrease or both (my scarf has two pointy ends, and I can either make two pieces and join them or I can learn how to decrease at an angle).<br /><br />One section covers circular knitting which can be done with 4-5 straight double pointed needles or a circular needle.  Volume I also shows the knitter how to make a reversible stocking stitch or reversible checks using two colors, as well as specialty stitches such as Aran pattern panels which involve, cables and bobbles, and Fair Isle weaving.  Most useful to me is the material in the section called `Slip Stitch Patterns\\" where you knit rows craftily to interweave various yarn colors.<br /><br />Some of this stuff is almost beyond me at this point in my knitting education, but having an idea what the instructor is saying helps me to follow along when she gives individualized instructions to the various members of our mixed class of beginners, intermediates, and advanced knitters.

Whereas the earlier volumes relied almost exclusively on written instructions, the examples in this volume are not only illustrated with beautiful photos of the finished swatches, they are also shown in diagram form, which is very useful for making a relatively complicated piece.  Slip stitch, cables and cross stitch patterns are all shown in detail. This is not a book of projects, such as sweaters and scarves, but rather a book of knitting samples with plenty of information for making each swatch.<br /><br />I find the Harmony Guides useful reference tools, and I have used the patterns in earlier volumes to make test swatches to help me decide whether or not a yarn is suitable for a project from another book.  Although I am slightly beyond beginning status as a knitter ( I can knit and purl,  and do a few other basic things relatively well). I am collecting the Harmony series, because I know some day, I am going to use this book.	2005-02-28

Pam Allen, the editor of SCARFSTYLE is the author of the KNITTING FOR DUMMIES book, hoewever, this does not mean the scarf patterns included in this volume are easy to carry out.  While beautiful, these scarfs are not an extension of the dummies book.  As Allen notes, \\"The scarfs in this book expand our idea of what a scarf can be.\\" Many of the scarfs involve complicated patterns using multiple colors.  Many involve stitches I consider beyond the norm.  Many use less common yarns.<br /><br /> I began the scarf called `Misty Garden' at my knitting class and although the lacy pattern calls for a beautiful mohair and wool yarn, I had to switch to a wool double knit yarn to get anywhere. Eventually, I will make the scarf Jo Sharp has designed, but until I master the stitches, I am not switching to the mohair yarn.<br /><br /> Maybe it's just me, but I would venture to say the scarfs in this book are beyond the ken of ordinary knitters, however, the photographs are drop-dead gorgeous and reason enough to buy the book.	2005-02-27

Okay, now I'm getting somewhere.  As a life long crocheter who was becoming a little frustrated by all the 'HIP' offerings, I have found 200 CROCHET BLOCKS for blankets, throws and Afghans, incredibly helpful for making traditional items.  Sure, if you wanted to be ornery you could say all crochet blocks devolve to a granny square, but they don't, really.<br /><br />Using a combination of colors and stitches, Jan Eaton has given crochet a new lease on life as far as I am concerned. The book layout includes a six-page block directory showing the reference points for all the blocks (respective numbers and pages) as well as several pages of designs (how one might assemble the blocks into a specific pattern). Eaton also includes directions on how to use the book for those folks who do not possess a logical or rational approach to life.  Included in these pages is a chart with the unique symbols that give the reader clues as to the assembly of an item as well as the level of difficulty. Patience is the byword with these projects.<br /><br />The one criticism I have of this book is the list of suggested suppliers Eaton provides is pathetic. I tried to locate several of them on the web, and had little success. The major supplier she mentions is located in Canada, with no outlets in the US.  Again maybe it's just me, but I order almost everything I buy over the web, and I have not experienced this difficulty heretofore. (I've used the Yarn Market link Amazon supplies.)  Fortunately, I live in an urban area well supplied with fiber stores, so I think I will be able to find what I need at the shop where I am taking knitting classes.	2005-02-27

Donna Kooler has done it again.  Like her Encyclopedia of Crochet, the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF KNITTING is a must-have resource for your knitting-crocheting library.  EN is divided into three major sections: 1/ history and other basic information; 2/ a few dozen knitting projects (scarves, pullover, hat or two, beautiful pullover shawl in kaleidoscopic pattern, a toy or two, dog jackets, socks); 3/ `Knitting Pattern Gallery'.<br /><br />The Knitting Pattern Gallery shows pages and pages of various pattern swatches with instructions on how to make each of them.  I find making a swatch a really good thing to do before I become immersed (and embroiled) in a larger project. Some of these patterns are quite complicated and definitely beyond the skills at hand of the new knitter. Others are doable. If you are working on a complex pattern and want a little guidance, Kooler's books are handy to have nearby.  I refer to them all the time. Sometimes you just need to see a stitch up close to determine whether or not you can tackle it. ***** for patterns; **** for projects	2005-02-09

STITCH AND BITCH NATION is a great complement to Debbie Stoller's earlier book STITCH N' BITCH.  In the more recent SBN Stoller offers many more `baby' projects, some practical, some pure whimsey.  I particularly like the child's `bunny' hat and the dog jacket, but don't think I'll ever take the time to knit my friend's cat something to destroy. SBN shows you how to make everything from beaded cuffs displaying Jolly Roger, for the punk in your life, to a tea cozy or two.  I have been looking for a good tea cozy pattern and this one looks promising.  I can add or omit the `Coffee, Tea, or Me' from the side.<br /><br />I don't like knitted or crochet bags because they..well..bag.  Nothing like finishing the evening dragging your bag on the ground.  SBN includes a half dozen variants of this item. The `Totally Tubular Miniskirt/boob Tube' is far more appealing than you would think from it's name. Remember when those boob tubes were all the rage a few years ago?  Can you believe you ever wore one?  The item pictured in SBN can be made larger and used over your shoulders like a continuous shawl (no, the model does not appear to be hog-tied).<br /><br />There are no scarves as such but a shawl or two, and a sweater knitted in blue-red-white to form the Union Jack for those feeling nostalgic for the `Old Country'.  As I said earlier, I particularly like the knitted bunny baby cap and the hats for adults too.  I could do without some of the other items, but who knows, maybe they will make funky gifts.	2005-02-09

Sometimes I think having an association with a favorite writer is like marriage-for better or worse.  I have not liked several recent mysteries by Deborah Crombie, but I hung in there, reading her latest book waiting for another DREAMING OF THE BONES or KISSED A SAD GOODBYE.  I have been rewarded by her latest book-NOW MAY YOU WEEP.<br /><br />Folks talk about the perfect storm-and this book is the perfect book. First of all it is a really good read and I read it in two sittings. The main characters-the two detectives Gemma James and Duncan Kincaid-are back and in fine form, and mostly behaving like the professional cops they are supposed to be. Gemma and Duncan have found a way to live together and work together without actually being on the same payroll together-thus sparing the sensibilities of those of us who grow weary of watching coworkers sleep their way to the top. The plot of the book, while not ingenious is very good-and believable, and the setting is to die for. The development of the supporting characters, especially longtime friend Hazel is quite credible and long overdue. Crombie's description of child and animal behavior is also quite good. According to the book jacket Crombie lives with three cats and a dog, so she is obviously aware and observant, and possesses a skill for understanding feline and canine behavior.<br /><br />One of the best features of the book, from my perspective, is that Crombie describes the art of whiskey manufacture without overwhelming the reader with too much information. As the relative of a long line of Scots who made `fine\\" whisky in the hills of Kentucky and who went on to make liquor long after Prohibition was the law of the land  (didn't everyone have a grandfather with a still in the chicken house and a grandmother who put up `medicinal' dandelion wine?), I greatly appreciated the detail about Scotch whiskey making.<br /><br />This is a sad book. Even though I could tell from the telltale foreshadowing who the victim would be, I kept hoping it was not so. I could also figure out just ahead of the detectives who the murderer was which every mystery reader likes to do. Probably the thing I liked the best about this book is that Crombie has acknowledged ever so skillfully and subtly that divination and clairvoyance are quite real (either that or she has moved into the area of fictional writing known as magical realism-either way it is great!!). Good police work and good parenting are often quite intuitive.  Keep it up Ms Crombie.  This is the best so far.the victim would be, I kept hoping it was not so.

Well unless you have read THE GOSPEL OF MARY MAGDALENE, you don't. This book is a translation of the ancient scroll in Coptic Greek found in Egypt-before the Nag Hammadi scrolls were discovered and translated.  Mary's gospel was translated by Jean-Yves Leloup into French and then into English by Joseph Rowe, who provides copious notes and footnotes.<br /><br />The translation has two parts.  The first part is a full  translation of what remains from the original gospel text by Miriam of Magdala--whom many believe to be Mary Magdalene.  The second part includes a section by section translation and commentary.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book immensely, and found it inspiring and beautiful, reading a little bit every day. Readers of THE ALABASTER JAR will not be disappointed. This text is a message of love and hope from one who was close to 'The Teacher'. The reviewer who discounted the book is blind--in my humble opinion. MM is a devotional in which Mary shares what she experienced with Yeshua whom the apostles called Jesus. She inspires me to repeat her words--\\"Let he or she who has eyes SEE.\\"	2005-02-06

The message of Timothy Garton Ashe's FREE WORLD is familiar to those who are informed, but it remains useful because unlike many other English-speaking writers of these times, Ashe is not engaged in polemics. Rather he seeks to find a constructive middle ground among and between the various factions in the West-Europe and America - which he describes as not unlike lemmings fighting on the edge of a cliff (Briton and France he likens to Mattheau and Lemmon in `Grumpy Old Men'). He suggests that America is divided against itself, and Europe is divided about America. Furthermore, Europe cannot succeed alone and America cannot succeed alone, and the Atlantic-based West probably has only about 20 more years of hegemony before another superstar arises that may not have the best interests of the West at heart-probably from the East-perhaps China, Japan India, or Islamic centered in Indonesia.<br /><br />Garton says the West needs to address issues of concern in four global areas: 1/ The Near East; 2/ The Far East; 3/ The South with its staggering poverty; 4/ The environmental health of the globe.  These four areas are not mutually exclusive.  Poverty and population growth which contribute to the degradation of the planet are still the major issues they have been for several decades. Rather than make the problem better the West has made the problem worse.  Ashe reviews issues that plague the rest of the world, such as farm subsidies and import regulations in the West that harm rather than help. Free range, free trade, `free' is the operative word.<br /><br />The educated and informed may not find Ashe is saying anything new, but this book is a good summarization of where we in the West stand at this moment in time, and what our role has been and might be.<br /><br />If you want to become more informed, i.e. get a handle on current events without the polemics (the book does not \\"trash\\" Bush), FREE WORLD is excellent resource-and it reads well (I love his metaphors). Although many of us may want to drop out, every one of us has a stake in world affairs, if not for our own sake, for the sake of our children.  This book raises consciousness of current affairs and how they revolve around decisions made in the West. You can contribute to the solution or be part of the problem--the choice is yours.  No matter what part of the planet you call home, or what your politics might be, you will find this book informative--unless you know it all.s).

When it comes to crocheting or knitting, not everyone is at the same stage of development.  I learned to crochet many years ago and have recently been reviving my skills.  Where formerly I made lace edging and doilies using cotton thread, I am now engaged in working with wool using larger yarns and needles.  CROCHET RUGS & THROWS by Janet Hobbs, provides the reader with projects for fair to middling crochet workers, who like me want to use 4-8 ply strands of wool.<br /><br />While this book is touted as a design book (which has been pooh-poohed by another reviewer), it is not exactly filled with amazing and complex new designs.  Although she does include a pram cover constructed using white squares that rely on pattern more than color, the major design element Hobbs uses is color. She is somewhat overly reliant on the `bobble' stitch. The bobble is the \\"bump\\" in the throw on the cover of the book jacket and it is used almost every item in this book. I did not know how to make a bobble, and did not find Hobbs' instructions helpful. If you can make basic crochet stitches and have not made a bobble, I suggest you refer to Donna Kooler's ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CROCHET STITCHES. (A bobble is not a popcorn stitch.)	2005-02-05

How did I ever manage without Donna Kooler's Encyclopedia of stitches?  I have found that designers often overlook some of the most basic instructions a reader needs to get the project done. Kooler has stepped in and provided all manner of instructions for experienced and inexperienced crocheters in her nifty encyclopedia. She even throws in a few projects of her own, including a beautiful `wedding keepsake'.  Her book includes many examples of the old-timey stitches, including antique pieces of preserved lace, as well as specialty and exotic items such as `Tunisian' crochet.<br /><br />The examples in this book range from simple to complex and some involve embroidery and knitting finishing touches.  One item, a little blanket she calls `Baby Bobbles' looks relatively easy to make and it is awfully pretty (all single and double crochet, the bobble being a cluster of double crochet stitches).	2005-02-05

These shawls and wraps are creative, but some of color combos are awful.  If I had picked this book up in a fiber store, I probably would not have bought it because I don't find the items pictured as particularly attractive.  However, giving it a second glance (now that I have purchased it sight unseen) I find a number of items I might actually make.  I often become chilled right in the middle of my back. Wearing a sweater makes me too warm. And while I like Challi wool scarves, I find they often slip off at inopportune moments.  I detest heavy turtle neck sweaters, and pullover weskets that men wear,  so I have gone to vests of all sizes and shapes, though the ones that keep me warm in the right spots are often unstylish. Besides, after a while one can become awfully tired of donning a vest for work everyday.<br /><br />So,  I was pleased to discover a great new (to me) item of clothing, a scarf that sits on your shoulders like a small buttoned stole.  Nancy Wisemen, author of KNITTED SHAWLS, STOLES, AND SCARVES, has included several diagonal and square scarves that fit over your head and rest on your shoulder.  They don't make you feel smothered like a turtleneck, and they don't overheat your arms and lower chest. Made with mohair or a light wool, they are featherweight, so you don't feel as if you are carrying a pack on your back. (Some items are to be constructed with cotton).<br /><br />By knitting, I am resuming the use of an abandoned skill, so I am fairly rusty.  The items in KSSS will stretch me a bit, they are not for beginners.	2005-02-05

VOGUE SCARVES is a complementary volume to the larger VOGUE basic knitting book.  I bought the scarves book because I need inspiration. As I struggle to master basic knitting techniques, I like to think ahead to what might be possible if I persevere. This little book includes some beautiful examples of what might be possible if my fingers ever become un-numb from the work I've been doing.<br /><br />Some of the Vogue scarf designs depend on fancy stitches, some on appliques, some on more than one color, some on a mix of the above.  Many of the scarves include basic stitches I am already beginning to master. A good example of a relatively simple design is the `Chevron' scarf, which involves the garter stitch, knitting on a biased pattern by increasing stitches at each row, and using more than one color.<br /><br />Seems as though knitting like advanced math involves calculations built up from addition and subtraction (`advanced' knitting techniques reduce to knitting and purling--apparently the reverse of each other). The most important ingredient in becoming a proficient advanced knitter is to master the basics. This book is for those capable of persevering who are ready to tackle more knitting and purling.	2005-01-30

Ever thought about making a nose warmer for these cold winter days? Have you or someone you love got a svelte figure that would look good in a knitted skirt? If you can say yes to these questions KNIT WIT by Amy Singer may be the book for you.<br /><br />Singer says she is horribly allegic to wool, however, several of the projects in this book appear to be constructed from wool fibers (are they synthetic, or did soomeone else knit them?).  Several of the projects involve felting, which refers to the process that takes place when you accidently wash your favorite sweater in hot-hot water. Her book looks like a steno pad which you can stand up to read a page. Thus the claim to be a no-hands set of instructions.<br /><br />For a novice knitter like me, much of the information found in \\"Stich and Bitch\\" and other books illustrating the primary knitting steps proved invaluable. I used a combination of the `Dummies\\" book and S&B to teach myself how to knit and purl. You won't find much elementary information in Singer's book, but it is interesting if you have moved beyond the Dummies book. Singer's projects appear to be created with the more skilled knitter in mind, but even if I claimed to be such a person I would not be interested in making most of them.	2005-01-30

I've made scarves, afghans, table mats, lace and doilies, as well as many other small crocheted items.  I like COZY CROCHET because it includes some smaller items one can use as gifts, such as lace edging for pants and flowers for applique as well as the so-called `hippie' belt.  I made the latter for my 16-year old granddaughter and she thought it was \\"cool\\".  The flowers can be sewn on denim jackets and hats or the seat of your jeans. CC also includes lacy shawls and stoles, pillow covers, and a crochted skirt.  I am not too fond of crocheted items that hang-like skirts and purses-as they tend to grow longer and longer over time (stretch and sag), so I would advise not making them.<br /><br />The book also includes household items such as a fruit bowl made from fabric strips, a crocheted rug and dish rags. In every case one must ask, when this item becomes dirty, how will I get it clean--but the authors don't provide any info on that aspect.  I think all these things could be thrown in the washer, though it would depend on what you use as your basic fiber. Also, a good wash might make it unravel. Too often these books tell you how to make something but don't tell you how to care for it after you make it-this book does not explain how you would keep a item from stretching or unraveling in the washer--a painful experience after you spent hours making it.	2005-01-30

The book also includes all sorts of other information you might have determined before you left the house, such as `finished chest measurements' and `yarn choices'. The pages of this little book are heavy and covered with plastic, so it will add weight to your yarn bag.<br /><br />The illustrations are a mixed bag.  Some are clear and large so easy enough to see, but many of the more complex steps are small and hard to see (do I really need a large clear illustration of `slipping a stitch' and a small hard to see illustration of the `Purl Stitch-Continental Method?). Given the tradeoff between the weight of the book and likelihood I will use much of the material given my lack of knitting experience, I figure it's better to carry `Stitch and Bitch' with me on those excursions to the doctor's office.

Over the years Green has developed a good deal of expertise in the areas of folklore and magic, both grounded in the natural world. I like her works because rather than merely relate \\"fairy tales\\" and magical gimmickry, she interweaves folk tales and folk practices that reflect the practical ways our ancestors related with the ground of their being, the Earth. Like her Witch Alone, this book is crammed with useful information.<br /><br />Green's narrative shows us that understanding the world around you begins with appreciating the balance of the solar and lunar cycles that govern the natural world (if those phenomena aren't magical what is??).  And, what have humans done to affect this balance? (Two Indian scientists writing in a prestigious journal a few years ago suggested that Global Warming could be a factor  leading to a Tsunami - think of how the ice caps weight the top and bottom of the globe remembering all the while that the Earth's surface is made up of tectonic plates that slip and slide and cause quakes and tidal waves. What happens if the weight of these polar caps changes?)<br /><br />Once upon a time, there was a world not ruled by the clock or the calendar. Those devices were introduced to regulate and control people. We moderns are far removed from our natural roots and it's rhythms. The introduction of space-time `regulations' leads to ailments generated by living in an artificial world, such as seasonal affective disorders (too little natural and too much artificial light, not enough natural vitamins?), chronic fatigue (\\"daylight savings\\", long work hours and stressful commutes, noise pollution), and depression (consumption of overly refined sugars, bad fats, inorganic ingredients doctored with chemicals to \\"improve\\" taste).<br /><br />Green suggests that if we dig a little deeper and recover the practices and rituals associated with the `seasons' of the year which reflect the earth's natural rhythms, as well as practice a little old-fashioned common sense, we would better understand our role in the wild world. We could begin by reconnecting with the underlying pagan meanings associated with holidays and see that they represent celebrations of natural world, and continue by finding ways to be \\"Green\\".<br /><br />If you want to be an effective and vibrant witch and not simply a wannabee, get this book.

Although this jam-packed little volume is small enough to slip in your knitting/crochet basket, it holds enough information to rival larger books.  Practical tools and suggestions fill the book as well as illustrations that are easy to understand (for me and I've been crocheting a long time).  In case you forget the difference between the double crochet and the half-double crochet, the book includes example of those and other basic stitches as well as more ornate procedures such as making a popcorn stitch.  One set of pages covers making Granny squares including `Granny square triangles' and other forms of the popular pattern.  The book is printed in black and white and may not appeal to those who are color dependent.  The pages are heavy with clear plastic surfaces which makes them easy to clean and long wearing, but hard to flip through if you are looking for something specific. I find THE CROCHETER'S COMPANION useful for travel, but have better books for home use.	2005-01-17

Sean Hewitt (apparently a pen name) has written a work of fiction based on his years of experience as a Commodities Trader in New York.  As he calls this small book a work of fiction, my review will be of the work as fiction. The plot is simple - several amoral types plan a stock market set-up designed to make them millions if not billions. Three of the players are friends from youth (a trader who arranges the investment moves, the President of the US, and his `Chief of Staff').  The fourth is a member of the Saudi Royal family and a friend of the President's family.  A  \\"silent\\" partner with a death wish for the US also plays a role reaping benefits from the manipulation.<br /><br />Sound familiar?  Several of these characters bear an uncanny resemblance to characters in the film Farenheit 911.  What is not documented in F911 but found in this book is the detailed financial behind-the-scenes manipulation of futures commodities by people who know what they are doing compared with most people like you and me who if they make money from investments do so because of being in the right place on the right day, i.e. selling just before `they' sell, buying before`they' buy.<br /><br />The plot of this book is simple and may be based on fact or speculation or both. Your politics will probably persuade you which to believe. These characters are truly the 'One Dimensional' men we were warned about when we received our Liberal Arts degrees. They act but their action involves calculation (hope you like business math) for personal profit. They are superficial. They do not reflect moral issues or care about the consequences of their actions. They are the sum of their experience and it is evil. The outcome is predictable, there is no climax unless you call getting out of the market in time to save your $$ a right move. There is no redemption. They are indeed criminals and CRUDE BEDFELLOWS even if they broke no laws.	2005-01-16

Watching Shakespeare's Hamlet enacted on stage and on film over the years, like many, I have been puzzled by various aspects of the play. Is Hamlet really mad? Are we mad if we fail to understand him? Why does he appear to be so indecisive?  Other than the fact that everyone is dead at the end of the play, why is Hamlet's life a real tragedy? At last, all has become much clearer to me. Kenneth Chan, a medical doctor and physicist by trade and apparently a scholar and philosopher by avocation shares his vision of the meaning of Hamlet in his book QUINTESSENCE OF DUST - The Mystical Meaning of Hamlet. Chan suggests the play is nothing less than Shakespeare's reflection on the spiritual path each human must sooner or later engage or fail to find the Truth of his or her own life.<br /><br />Chan suggests several of the themes found in Hamlet also run through Shakespeare's plays `Julius Caesar' (mentioned three times in Hamlet) and `Titus Andronicus' (deals with revenge). Included among these themes are the failure to be \\"true to one's self\\" and the propensity of humans to blame others for life's shortcomings.<br /><br />What is the Truth? Chan suggests the truth is this...in the end we all die, but before we do, we will find multiple ways to avoid facing the reality of this eventuality. Some of us like Ophelia conform and hide behind someone else's mores, no matter how destructive their ideas are. Some like Laertes and Polonius take refuge in status and material wealth, still others like the King seek power, no matter how many others he must crush to achieve his goal.<br /><br />His book has provided me with illumination about a topic that has been a lifelong interest and I recommend it to anyone on a step wise path.	2005-01-12

Until I began reading about parakeets, I did not know LONG-TAILED PARAKEETS existed in the wild.  I also thought all parakeets looked like my granddaughters budgies (blue or yellow with undulating stripes on their backs). The `Manual' on Long-Tailed Parakeets by Annette Wolter includes sections on everything from diet and health maintenance to 'how-to' brooding of parakeets.  I especially like the many photos of the various wild parakeets from around the world (many taken in their native habitat) including a shot of a Quaker parrot like mine, which is apparently really a Quaker Parakeet. A number of the birds I think of as Conures are also parakeets.<br /><br />Wolter's book is an accessible easy-to-read volume with much of the material about companion bird keeping also found in other \\"bird\\" books (especially those by Vriends, who was her consulting editor) as well as relatively exclusive photos of various parakeets she describes as 'long-tailed'. The only thing I dislike about the photos in this book and many other bird books is that they often show birds biting on plants and almost always fail to identify the plant involved. As a gardener, I would like to know just exactly what that bird is chewing on so that I can grow it in my house (there are plenty of \\"do\\" or \\"don't\\" plant lists, but I know some of the plants shown in photos are not on those lists.	2005-01-08

THE NEW AUSTRALIAN PARAKEET HANDBOOK by Matthew Vriends, is a relatively technical volume covering \\"everything about purchase, housing, care, nutrition, behavior, breeding and disease' and a special chapter on `understanding the Australian Parakeet'<br /><br />Ever wonder where that blue or yellow budgie you own fits into the larger scheme of the Parakeet world?  This book won't tell you. NAPH describes the whereabouts of selected parakeets native to Australia, not `Melopsittacus undulatus. You won't find `Budgies' in the index either, and the `Grass Parakeet is not the Budgie according to this book.<br /><br />Vriends book covers the so-called `broad tailed parakeets' ornamental birds you might encounter on a field trip and want to breed yourself, could you catch a pair. Vriends Includes descriptions of Nymphicus hollandicus known to most of us as the`Cockatiel' and he also writes about lesser known species such as Rosellas, Ring-necks and Red-rumped Parakeets, as well as the Yellow-vented Blue Bonnet parakeet which must be a sight to see in the wild.  Vriends book is really a breeding and \\"birding\\" book comparable to those published by the Smithsonian on captive breeding programs for `threatened' birds held in captivity and/or finding them in their threatened habitats, and would make a good companion on your next trip through Australia to search the bush and back roads. In fact, one great shot shows an old guy with camper in the background, feeding a wild flock of Australian King Parrots with bright red heads (could this be the author?). The book includes many photos with poor captions and plenty of black and white drawings which I find offputting when trying to determine which species might be lurking on the fence post yonder.	2005-01-08

Matthew Vriends, consulting editor for THE COMPLETE BOOK OF PARAKEET CARE and a Veterinary and Bird Breeder from the Netherlands has written many books on Companion Parrots, as have authors Annette Wolter and Monika Wegler.  Their book about parakeets really covers the \\"betcherrygah\\" or budgie, a type of Australian parakeet, and includes much more material than any of the other parakeet books I've read to date, and I believe it deserves the sobriquet `comprehensive'.  The book includes a good deal of the information found in other books by Vriends and Wolters on basic bird care and breeding, as well as much specific information about parakeets or budgies divulged by Wolter and Wegler who appear to keep companion parakeets or budgies indoors (Vriends raises birds in an outdoor aviary).<br /><br />The book includes dozens of beautiful photos and sections covering parakeets and human children, setting up parakeet accommodations for a pair (they hate to live alone) health care and diet, breeding and baby bird care. The photos show the various colors of budgies generated by breeders like Vriends as well as action shots of budgies in all phases of living in your home -  from flying around a `bird-proof' room to courting rituals with a mate. The authors have created a `check list' the potential parakeet owner can use to determine if he or she can live with the requirements of keeping a companion budgie. Among other things, they stress that parakeets are probably better off spending more time outside the cage than in it, so if you are thinking about living with a parakeet you should consider whether or not you can put up with with the occasional bird dropping from a soaring feathered friend. Photos and text describe how to build a bird tree from which your birds can use to launch their explorations as well as return to enjoy a tasty snack of various vegetables and/or fruits.<br /><br />If you can buy only one parakeet (budgie) book get this book before you buy your parakeet.

Julie Rach's BUDGIE is an informative and useful guide for the care and preservation of your new Budgie pet, and probably the only book you will need for Budgie pet care. Rach has included a short history of this little Australian parrot including a discussion of the variants bred in England and America. Budgies in the wild come in a few colors, but the colors of the varieties are numerous. Apparently, Budgies are like popcorn, its hard to have only one, so if you are thinking of building an aviary full of Budgies, get THE PROPER CARE OF BUDGIES -- a more comprehensive book than Rach's --- that includes a more in-depth discussion of genetics and breeding.<br /><br />Rach offers much practical information on the caging, feeding and care of \\"pet\\" budgies, including a few medical tricks, such as how to give your bird an oral medicine.  Speaking of the photographs (there is one showing a Budgie receiving medication from an oral syringe), many were produced by Renee Stockdale, whose photos show up in other books on Budgies and Parakeets. Although Rach says Budgies should be housed in cages with bar spacing 7/16\\" or less, I noticed the same cage with bars ½\\" apart are shown in many of the photos, so either the photo editor was careless or Rach did not edit the book.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the text and looking at the photos, and recommend this book as the one you will need unless you are becoming a breeder.  The photos( taken in 1997) appear in other books on this topic, but Rach has covered all the bases for most Budgie owners.	2005-01-01

THE ESSENTIAL PARAKEET looks very much like an earlier book  about Budgies by Julia Rach.  Many of the photos are identical (Renee Stockdale).  The publisher is the same publisher.  The difference seems to be the book jacket and the word Parakeet instead of Budgie.<br /><br />This Parakeet book includes much of the same material on cage specifications, diet, and other considerations concerning the health and maintenance of Budgies, found in the earlier book by Rach.  So what is the difference between a Parakeet and a Budgie?  According to the editor, Americans call Budgies \\"Parakeets.\\"  \\"Not all Parakeets are Budgies\\", says the editor, Budgies are a specific species with a Latin name `Melopsittacus undulatus' or the \\"song-parrot with wavy lines.\\" Sometimes these little birds are called \\"grass parakeets\\" in their native Australia.  I don't think the book is a very helpful source of information about why Parakeets are different from Budgies. Maybe their is no difference.  Maybe a Budgie by any other name is still a swell bird.

In the 1960s, she formed a newsletter for those who knitted away from the mainstream as well as those who knew a good thing when they saw it.  She hosted also a nationally syndicated PBS television show called `The Busy Knitters' with a devoted following of millions of fans (including my left-handed mom).  She founded a newsletter and business (Schoolhouse Press) run today by her daughter, which sells knitting-related items and she wrote several books on the subject of knitting.

Two weeks ago on a Saturday morning, I found blood all over one of my Cockatiels.  I now know that he had pecked at a feather abscess which had burst and splattered its contents everywhere. THE COMPLETE BIRD OWNER'S HANDBOOK by Gallerstein provided me with the information I needed so that I could determine if the bleeding was life-threatening (such as a broken blood feather), and whether I could treat it. This information allowed me to wait until the following Monday to have my bird seen by a bird vet who performed surgery on the cyst and ran several tests (biopsy, etc. to make sure it was not something that would kill my other birds) -- thus a $300+ vet bill instead of something much worse in at emergency service. I bought FIRST AID FOR BOOKS after this incident thinking it would provide me with additional insight into bird health situations, but it does not.  Though more accessible, FIRST AID is a synopsis of some of the more common crises discussed in the larger book by Gallerstein.<br /><br />In FIRST AID FOR BIRDS, Julie Rach and Gary Gallerstein explain that their book addressed the immediate steps to take in selected health crises (no feather abscesses here). Each topic covered is divided into several parts: the crises (for example fracture), the signs (leg hanging at a funny angle), home treatment (confine bird....), Veterinary treatment.  (The book will help the bird owner figure out some steps to take in a selected crises, but the owner should read the larger Gallerstein book before a crises arises.<br /><br />FIRST AID deals with some of the more common upsets covered in any good bird book, so I did not find any information I did not already have on hand, except a list of possible sources of lead poisoning including items like curtain weights - and believe me I am not going to try to figure out what poisoned my bird if he or she acts as if poison is at work, I am going to seek medical help immediately.<br /><br />FIRST AID (the book) is mostly about prevention - how to follow a proper diet and eschew household hazards. As I already had a good deal of this information on hand in other sources, I found this book disappointing. It would have been more useful if it had provided me with \\"triage\\" information to address various crises, i.e. what do you look for in a bleeding bird, i.e., what signs help you determine if bleeding is the result of a broken blood feather, an abscess (I had never seen a feather abscess), or something else, and what to do in each case.<br /><br />HOLISTIC CARE FOR BIRDS by McCluggage and Higdon addresses home remedies as well as preventative measures and is thus acts as a complentary book with much greater detail on the home remedies offered in FIRST AID.

When I was younger, before I joined the paid labor force, I was a regular little `Martha Stewart' who could crochet and sew.  I was an excellent seamstress.  I made suits with lined jackets and skirts, and slacks, as well as formal gowns.  I crocheted blankets, scarves, lace for linens, doilies, place mats, coasters, and all sorts of things folks no longer use or make. I stopped sewing and crocheting 20 years ago (nowadays, I get the dry cleaner to sew on buttons...how low can I go?), and became a proficient with computers.  Facing retirement, I am now exploring skills I used to call my own, plus learning new skills such as knitting.  My mother and both grandmothers were knitters (great grandma Nichols knitted 500 sweaters for the Red Cross during WWI), and I wish I had listened more carefully when they tried in vain to teach me how to knit.<br /><br />I bought VOGUE KNITTING not because I am about to make the fabulous items in this book, but because I used to buy Vogue patterns when I was sewing all my clothes. The Vogue patterns were wonderful, not only because the garments were stylish, but because they included instructions on how to alter or modify a pattern to accommodate figure differences.<br /><br />Although I am not at this time a proficient knitter, I can see this book will prove useful as I become more skilled. It includes much information about how to make patterned knits and designs, incorporate interesting elements in the weave itself, and tailor garments to fit real people. Now here is a real incentive for mastering the basics.<br /><br />The book jacket claims this is the \\"Untimate Knitting Book\\" and I suspect they may be right.  This big heavy book is not for beginners - unless you are like me and want to dream of what you might do some day.	2004-12-31

(Mattie Sue Athan's experiences with her two adopted Grey Parrots, Bongo I and Bongo II are documented on her web site).<br /><br />Many pet birds are passed on by owners who are dead, too old, too sick, or move to less accommodating quarters.

Having adopted two Cockatiels two years ago who had terrorized everyone at the animal shelter and had them become two big sweeties I know what a little TLC can do. The sweetest bird I own, however, is a \\"hand-me-down Conure\\" with two previous owners. My Conure is also the biggest bird I own and the least nippy. Every morning he says \\"Give me a kiss\\" which I happily do with a \\"Thank-you\\" as my reward. \\"Used\\" birds frequently can talk and have learned cute tricks.<br /><br />Athan offers all sorts of tips on how to get your birds to comply with various challenges you might offer such as bathing, destroying toys instead of your books, and kissing not nipping when you offer your cheek or stick your hand in their cage. In her section on \\"The Corrective Environment\\" she shows how many of the tics the new-old bird learned were brought on by cramped, boring, and/or dirty quarters.  It is amazing what a little space and a new toy will do to improve an outlook.	2004-12-31

A breeder from whom I have purchased several birds makes raising parrot hatchlings look relatively easy compared with the process depicted in Phil Digney's Guide to INCUBATION AND HANDRAISING PARROTS. However, Digney is involved with parrot breeding programs in Australia, and some of his charges are environmentally challenged. Their loss, one assumes, would be great, so he cuts no corners. Digney,  a young man shown in one photograph feeding his baby parrots, has an impressive set of credentials. He has worked with captive breeding programs  for a dozen years or so, and as of the publication of this book, focused on Australian parrots, however, there is no reason to assume his techniques cannot be transferred to parrots from other parts of the world, although the average lay person probably would not go to so much trouble with a clutch of Cockatiels.<br /><br />Digney's book is technically impressive and makes interesting reading for an amateur like me interested in the future of birds. Raising baby parrots looks far more challenging than raising human babies. There are many ways you can go wrong with factors as diverse as choosing the proper bedding materials (non-toxic) to finding a bird's windpipe so that you don't drown him when you feed him with a tube.<br /><br />The guide is filled with wonderful colorful photographs and easy to follow text laid out with charts full of measurements (Digney apparently is a stickler for keeping good records). Before you decide whether to raise baby birds, you may want to check this book out, if for no other reason than to read about the merits of using a spoon, a syringe or a crop tube for feeding your new chicks.	2004-12-31

Depending on your needs, you will either find KNITTING INTO THE MYSTERY an illustrated book of prayers and a woefully inadequate source for knitting instructions, or you will like it.<br /><br />I am relearning to knit after all these years, and while it is true that I may need all the help I can get including prayers, I found this little book practically useless...so I sent it back. The authors have included one Hindu prayer apparently written in ancient Sanskrit(!!?) which I cannot read, so the book isn't completely overtly Christian -- which I am not. Why do some folks assume everyone interested in meditation is Christian? And how can you read prayers while you knit?<br /><br />I ordered and kept KNITTING FOR DUMMIES as it includes what I need --simple instrucions for the beginner with much more text and many photos of knitting needle positions.	2004-12-29

I continue to read and enjoy biographies reflecting life as it was lived in Europe before, during, and immediately after WWII because I want to know more about the world that was so cruelly destroyed by fools. Most of the books I've read set in this period are about combat, but a few are about the civilians who survived the scene. Generally, I find the civilians have had a far worse time of it-at least the soldiers seem to eat fairly regularly.  I read ANNI ADAMS: THE BUTTERFLY OF LUXUMBOURG expecting the biography of a woman who lived in these interesting times and survived them to be a good read, but having read such works as Embattled Selves and Woman in Amber  I found the `butterfly' story a bit jejune.<br /><br />In some ways, Anni reminds me of my mother-in-law Pola, who came to the backwater of Wilmington NC  in 1919, as one of the many young women who married an American GI in the aftermath of WWI or WWII.  In provincial parts of the US \\"foreigners\\" like Pola were considered exotic and elusive creatures who could enchant young girls like me with their tales of past times, not unlike the `butterfly' Mr Story uses as his motif. Those who have not lived before, during, and after a war cannot readily identify with those who have, but they can identify with and appreciate what is good and experience sorrow over its loss. I believe Mr. Story's retelling of Anni's story could prove instructive for the relatively unsophisticated reader who might come to understand and appreciate a life very different from his or her own sheltered existence.<br /><br />First of all, brides like Anni on arriving in the US could speak a delectable language only a few others understood. Being from Luxumbourg, Anni spoke a French dialect, words of which Mr. Story uses to pepper his tale. For another, these women generally knew all about the existence of different foods, different ways of doing things, and different modes of clothing, travel, and comportment as well as different means of accommodation. Again, Mr. Story has done an admirable job of depicting Anni's lost world.<br /><br />War brought an end to the fabled existence Anni lived, but years later she could still recall amazing anecdotes and wonderful tales about long-lost relatives or friends and the various ways she survived the nightmare that followed after her world came crashing down.  Anni shared her stories with Mr. Story who has brought them to us using first person narrative, apt imagery and many Bible passages.  The author describes the nightmare Anni survived only to arrive years later in the US and begin her new life as a war bride. He also includes the story of  Annis courtship by a young soldier named Charlie as reflected in his letters. This book is suitable for a teenage audience of some naivete, but older readers exposed to the harsher realities may not find themselves as engaged in Anni's remembrances of things in the past.s of accommodation.

Casson, and Charles F. Haanel	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Wise words that work for you.....	More than 25 years ago, I took part in a self-help workshop entitled \\"Money Love.\\"  Having thought of my poverty with virtuousness for years, I found it hard to sign up for a workshop dedicated to improving my material lot, let alone absorb the message of the instructor shared with us. One of the many books she included was Napoleon Hill's `Think and Grow Rich.'  Now at that time, this seemed a preposterous title.  How could you do such a thing. Yet, I am here to report that Hill is correct, \\"What the mind conceives and believes, it will achieve.\\"  Yes, you do have to have an idea of where you are going if you intend to get there.  And, you have to risk - or \\"go out on a limb to get the fruit.\\"  The biggest risk of all of course is changing the way you think. We humans tend to cling to outmoded thinking long after it no longer serves our purpose.<br /><br />In THE GET-TO-THE-POINT SUCCESS READER, Rodney Ohebsion has compiled the most salient points from books by Hill and others (Orison Swett Marden, Samuel Smiles, Herbert Casson, and Charles Haanel)  who long ago pointed the way to individual success for those who would read, absorb, and practice the principles they taught. I can testify that this material really works in terms of material success and position. Within ten years of being introduced to the material, I moved from a minor position in retail sales to that of an executive with a large corporation, and I did it during the dismal 80s.<br /><br />Will it work for you?  I don't know, but I am willing to bet if you read it, absorb it, and take it to heart it will.  I am so immersed in this material, that I am not a good judge of whether a \\"quickie\\" version has the same effect. However, if you have read the books summarized in Ohebsion's book, his little \\"get-to-the-point\\" book is a good refresher, and if you haven't read the books, his book can give you some insights into the material in the original sources.<br /><br />Ohebsion has provided the reader with a quick reference to carry around and dip into as time permits. You can carry the book in your back pack and read it standing up on the subway, while eating your lunch on a park bench, or in your favorite chair at home. Go ahead..take a risk and read it.carry around and dip into as time permits.

Ellen Freudenheim has written the book for you - LOOKING FORWARD An Optimist's Guide to Retirement.  Now you might have attended a retirement seminar or two, and so have I, but in my opinion this book is the best resource I've found in a while. I have been researching the subject because at age 62 I am in the `Retirement Zone' as Freudenheim refers to it. She covers all the areas I have been exploring for retirement activity such as travel, theater, gardening and athletics, and volunteer work, as well as continuing to do what you are doing, i.e. work.<br /><br />If you want to continue to work, you might consider changing careers as my husband did. After retiring from AT&T (he was downsized or \\"rightsized\\" as they called it in the corporate world in the 1980s), he he took his \\"buyout\\" money and attended graduate school where he obtained a degree in Employee Relations Counseling which he did professionally for 10 years before he was forced out of the market by the competition (he filed an EEO complaint because he suspected age, race and/or sex discrimination were issues and was proved correct). After the government disbanded the office he worked in (contracted out), he then took up work as a Patent Examiner so as to complete his government retirement -  not as you might expect in his field of Electrical Engineering which he learned on the job with AT&T - but the field of personal computers which he taught himself by building several of them for me and the grand kids. Today, retired with two pensions, he plays tennis four days a week and complains about being bored. However, when he heard me speak of Freudenheim's book he said, \\"I want to read that when you' re through with it.\\"<br /><br />According to Freudenheim, my husband and I are merely examples of what the statistics have been showing. She combines many life histories along with statistics from reputable sources to explore the truth of the retirement zone from overall and individual perspectives. The truth is, large numbers of people are in the retirement zone (and not just because of the baby boom as we so often hear, but also owing to increased immigration beginning 40 years ago as well as increased life expectancy among the older population). Many potential retirees continue to work (women more so than men, as the immediate cohorts of women stayed home with the kids back in the \\"old\\" days, and they have not yet put in enough years for retirement benefits).  And, depending on your profession, the pressure to quit working is enormous after you reach a certain age, because those younger workers breathing down your neck have spent their lives in much larger cohorts of the baby boom (just wait until those kids born in 1957-1961 hit retirement ages!!). However, other types of employment may be available to you. Sometimes you just need to look around. Freudenheim suggests there are choices to be made.<br /><br />Should you leave work altogether - which my 75-year old husband finally did, Freudenheim has tons of  suggestions (I hope he really does read her book!!). She provides the reader with all sorts of alternatives for occupying your time fruitfully - paid and unpaid, or if you really don't want to work she has other suggestions. Her book is a comprehensive resource with hundreds of sources - books, websites, and ideas gleaned from others who have tackled the Retirement Zone.<br /><br />Will I retire soon?  Who knows.  Right now, I am just living one day at a time.  It's comforting to know, however, that I do have alternatives, and that I am not alone.overall and individual perspectives.

Perhaps because of his background as a breeder of various species of domestic (pet birds) and experience as a bird vet, I find Matthew Viends' books tend to slant toward the physical care and breeding birds. He maintains outdoor aviaries, which can be much more of a challenge than a simple cage in a third floor apartment.  So, if you only read Vriends you might become overly concerned about health issues and nest boxes.<br /><br />On the other hand Vriends' books are very informative,including this volume on Conures.  He informs the reader about health matters, so that if you do experience a bird who is 'under the weather' you won't panic.<br /><br />If you are seriously contemplating buying your first Conure, you might want to read Anne Watkins book on Conures and use Vriends book to complement topics dealing with Conure health and feeding issues.<br /><br />To pellet or not to pellet...Vriends covers this topic and I find it timely as my new Conure (who was formerly owned by a kind lady) is fond of Zupreme Conure pellets (except purple..he apparently does not like grape).  You can drive yourself crazy trying to feed your feathered pal all the correct veggies, egg yolk seed mix, minerals, cuttlebone, etc. (and I do this) or you can think about pellets. (My birds get a great assortment of greens and most of them also have pellets with or in lieu of their seed mix.) It is comforting to know that a vet and breeder of Vriends' stature is supportive of pellet use.	2004-12-15

I bought this book a while back when my granddaughter Rita became interested in Conures. I thought we were going to get a Conure for her, but we ended up buying a Cockatiel and Grandma got the Conure. I have four Cockatiels and they are the sweetest birds, so I thought the best pet for a child (Rita is a responsible 12-year old) might not be a Conure, as they are described as being somewhat vocal.<br /><br />I discovered a Blue-Crested (Crowned) Conure in need of a home at my local bird store and became fascinated with him. Vinnie, as he is known, had been previously owned by an older woman who could no longer care for him.  He is a sweet bird and he talks, so I having read Ms Watkins book decided to give it a whirl, and I brought him home.  Now I can honestly say that a Conure can be as sweet as a Cockatiel.  He makes some noises like a Crow, but I have three barking Poms, so he is mild in comparison (and he's learned to bark).<br /><br />THE CONURE HANDBOOK by Anne Watkins has proved a goldmine for this impulsive bird owner. Watkins explains how to choose a new baby or do what I did, and look for an older Conure who exhibits good traits (including healthy). The idea that the only bird you can have is a newborn ain't necessarily so.  Some older birds for sale or adoption have been put into care because their former owners simply could not take care of them anymore.<br /><br />MY new Conure Vinnie is getting along well with my \\"shelter\\" Cockatiels, and I use Ms Watkins book to inform me about foods Vinnie can eat as well as other requirements. The book is filled with easy to read text and many photos of the various members of the Conure species. Based on my experience, I am thinking I may purchase more and different buddies.	2004-12-15

When I bought this book, I also purchased Conure books by Anne Watkins and Matthew Vriends.  GUIDE TO CONURE is not the best of the three, in my opinion. However, that said, if this is the book you can find then get it and use it.  The book is a hard back whereas the others are soft covered books (if that matters), and Rach covers all the basics regarding food, shelter, health issues, etc. In fact, you could use much of the material in her book for any bird's care.  She also includes a nice section on the various types of Conures and sections on Conure health that cover issues of concern to this species in particular as well as things to beware of if your Conure is a \\"free-flight\\" bird.<br /><br />Rach includes a nice long section on cage selection as does Watkins.  If you haven't given much thought to the cage you should. Conures can be messy birds and you want to buy something big enough to house your guy made of a substance he can't dismantle that is relatively easy to clean. This means you must think about the cage in terms of space considerations and weight. When the FedEX guy delivered my conure's cage he accused me of ruining his health.  There are great cages available, but you should consider the cost of the cage and it's accessories when you buy your bird. Rach's book will help you reflect on these and other issues	2004-12-15

THE GREAT INFLUENZA by John Barry is probably the most difficult book I've ever read.  No, it's not that complex, and it is not the longest book I've ever read, but it is heart-rending. I could only read 20-30 pages a day, with tears streaming down my face as I did, so it has taken me quite a while to finish the book, but finish I did. You certainly won't read this for fun, but you might for the sake of curiosity, which is what impelled me to take it on in the first place.<br /><br />The Great Influenza was a disaster that very nearly wiped out civilization.  The disease drew to a close of it's own accord.  Doctors never found a cure, Barry says, \\"The virus was too efficient, too explosive, too good at what it did.  In the end it did its will around the world.\\"<br /><br />The Great Influenza found humankind every where it lived.  From the villages of Aleuts in Alaska to the jungles of Africa no one was safe.  It began mildly and ended mildly because as it circled the world it mutated.  Although it was called the Spanish Influenza (because the Spanish government actually informed the public of its presence and effects, whereas the US Government told lies and more lies about the disease), the Great Influenza probably started on a farm in the midwest and was spread overseas by troop movements during the Great War.<br /><br />Barry's book traces the battle by medical personnel as they fought to save the lives of US military and in some cases civilians (civilians got the short end of the stick for the most part. Resources and funds and medical personnel were needed for the War effort).<br /><br />Barry describes how John's Hopkins and Harvard built medical reputations based on the struggles of a few noted scientists who tried to find a way to prevent and/or cure influenza. He writes of the effort by medical research teams at the Rockefeller Institute and the Public Health Service to attempted to reach out to and alleviate the suffering of the millions of afflicted souls.<br /><br />The treatments used to deal with the Great Influenza read like a chamber of horrors from the Middle Ages. Everything from bleeding to poisoning the host (victim) was brought to bear on the germs, but nothing prevailed.  The death rates were high no matter what the treatment.  One promising avenue involved the development of various vaccines using horses blood.<br /><br />After reading this book, I understand better why physicians refer to their work as \\"practice\\" because that is what those who survived did.  Unfortunately, like the Black Plague, the Influenza virus made no distinctions, so many of the dead included medical personnel.<br /><br />The question today is...could it happen again.  Barry leaves no doubt that you are not likely to  get a straight answer from those in authority-never have, never will.ted souls. <br /> <br />The treatments used to deal with the Great Influenza read like a chamber of horrors from the Middle Ages.

I've been reading extensively about HBP ever since I experienced a stroke last March.  So far I find James Scala's book most useful.  My physician suggested I lower my salt intake and Scala covers various aspects of the role sodium plays in the body's functions including it's relationship with potassium (K-factor).  Potassium is awfully important and most of us don't get enough of it, but sometimes it is difficult to get enough without eating too much sodium. Scala has some easy to follow suggestions regarding the consumption of sodium, including \\"Start each day with a cereal that has more potassium than sodium...\\"  As oatmeal is a winner, I can eat that or another cooked ceral or if I'm in a hurry, I can eat one of the several dry cereals one can pour from a box, such as the Nabisco Shredded Wheat I've eaten since I was a child and others. Dr. Scala is a certified nutrition specialist who has written a number of books addressing the consumption of food and a particular ailment affecting the human body.<br /><br />One of his better known recommendations is to keep a food diary.  I had to buy a special pill box so I could keep track of the pills I consume each day, so it is certainly helpful to note what I've eaten.  The other option is to eat the same thing every day, which some folks do, but I can't. Scala says only three things are necessary to keep a food diary: honesty, keeping track of what you eat, and noting the results.<br /><br />Another suggestion Scala offers the reader concerns fat intake. Most of us know by now that some fats are bad.  What you may not know is that some are good for you.  Flax oil and certain  oils consumed by eating fish are also good.<br /><br />Scala like most nutritionist covers sugar. Face it guys, we consume too much of the stuff.  Sadly, it can be hidden in innocuous looking foods like low fat yogurt and certain \\"non-sweetened\\" cereals. Eating complex carbohydrates, more fruits and vegetables (including garlic and onions) and plenty of fiber and water round out De. Scala's nutrition suggestions. You can use Kyolic garlic capsules if you don't want to smell like an asafetida bag, however, garlic is wonderful in stir fries, soup, spagetti sauce, stuffing (made with low sodium bread of course), and salads.<br /><br />Scala includes tips on dining-out, exercising and stress alleviation to round out his book, making it overall one of the best I've read on the topic of lowering blood pressure.and plenty of fiber and water round out De.

I spoke with my physician yesterday about THE COENZYME Q10 PHENOMENA and he suggested the jury is still out on this topic.  He says it probably won't hurt me but, it is relatively expensive and there is no real medical evidence that it does what some purport it does. Dr.  Stephen Sinatra has an entirely different take on the topic so if you want to know more his experiences with patients his book is the place to begin.  Sinatra is a cardiologist, but in my experience they don't necessarily know more about high blood pressure than an doctor of internal medicine (my doctor).  Apparently, the some of the chemicals that show up in blood work that can be interpreted as \\"you just had a heart attack\\" can also show up for other reasons.<br /><br />Dr. Sinatra says that when you improve heart health, you also improve your overall health. He says links exist between the heart and degenerative disease such as Diabetes, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. He says in his experience if Coenzyeme Q10 is depleted from too much exercise, pollution, eating poorly, or taking drugs that interfere with it, patients have a higher incidence of radical-based degenerative diseases.  Based on that, I say, that perhaps what we need to do is be careful of the kind of exercise we take, eat well, and fight for the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.<br /><br />Dr. Sinatra also suggests the Mediterranean Diet with lots of vegetables and fruits is a good place to begin if you want to improve your diet. He includes 13 pages of recipes at the end of his book.	2004-12-04

Ever wonder about the mechanics of hypertension - what is it and how is it affecting your body?  James Whitaker discusses how someone like me who worked out in the gym 3-4 times a week, has eaten right for years and had normal cholesterol readings could have a stoke. You could have knocked me down with a feather when it happened - and I mean that literally.<br /><br />No one ever told me about aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), Angiotensin II, or Nitric Oxide, or the role the renin-angiotension-aldosterone system(RAAS) played in regulating blood pressure.  Seems there are at least two types of hypertension and that stress is a major factor that can affect your body and shorten your life. As I never used Cocaine, that must be the cause of my secondary hypertension and why my physician has prescribed an ACE inhibitor and a BETA blocker. (By the way, you might want to read this book for no other reason than to discover the danger of taking a BETA-Blocker with an anti-diuretic for an extended period.<br /><br />Whitaker lists some controllable risk factors most of us need to know more about including obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes, diet, smoking and drinking. I have never smoked and I don't drink alcohol, and I am using a variant of the DASH diet (also discussed in this book).

Ever wonder what Asparagus, Avacados and Anger have to do with hypertension?  Although some folks suggest you should not eat Avocados if you are on a low fat diet, perhaps you will reconsider after you read Steven and Jan Sinatra's book. And although asparagus are available seasonally, so you may want to eat as many of the fresh ones as you can and avoid the canned variety unless you wash the salt off. Frozen asparagus are okay but they lack the crunch of course. The Sinatras say your best bet is to freeze your own.<br /><br />Anger is the killer. Try yoga, deep breathing exercises, aromatherapy, and pets to release anger. Bodywork including massage will lower your blood pressure if you get angry. Working out with weights or walking can be wonderful stress relievers.<br /><br />Quercetin in tea and/or red wine may be better for you than taking medications with COX-2 inhibitors. The Sinatras include meal plans and recipes.  I'm already eating lots of soy and rice, but the Sinatras offer many other good ideas. My philosopy is `Take what you need and leave the rest\\" and there is plenty I can take from this book.	2004-12-01

No one knows for certain, although Thomas Moore has his suspicions and offers some suggestions for the reader. Moore,  a member of the Harvard Medical School and Boston University faculties, and his co-authors tested the effects of three different diets: 1) the so-called typical American diet; 2) a fruit and vegetable diet; and 3) the DASH diet, and noted that those who ate the DASH diet lost weight, and experienced better blood pressure, cholesterol and insulin resistance readings.<br /><br />Perhaps eating a combination of foods rich in fiber, magnesium, potassium, and calcium and high in anti-oxidants is part of the answer.  Perhaps eating less refined sugar is also a key.  Moore provides many suggestions for increasing the fiber in your diet by eating-you guessed it more vegetables and fruits and fewer GASS (grease-alcohol-sugar-salt) items.  Moore explains how to approach shopping at the super market, and menus and recipes for employing \\"Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\\" or DASH. According to the jacket of Moore's book, The American Heart Association, The National Heart Lung, and Blood Institute, and the American Society for Hypertension approve the DASH diet.<br /><br />I did not find anything new in this book, but if you aren't familiar with the DASH diet, perhaps you will.	2004-12-01

BIRDS OF A FEATHER, Jacqueline Winspear's second book in the Maisie Dobbs series is much better than her first book which was the best mystery I'd read in a while. In fact this second book is a masterpiece and an Anglophile's dream come true. As I was reading the book I thought to myself, Dorothy Sayers has been reincarnated and she has come back as Jacqueline Winspear.  I read history as well as mysteries, particularly the history of England, and am fascinated with the early 20th Century.<br /><br />Winspear includes a great deal of relevant historical information in her novels which makes me feel as if I am on a tour of England with a guide who knows her way around and can share all sorts of anecdotal information you will hear no where else. Her story is set the early 1930s and by default includes the late teens and 1920s as it covers the Great War and it's aftermath in retrospect. This period, as many readers know is approximately the period Dorothy Sayers covered in her masterpieces involving Lord Peter Wimsey who fought in France and was saved by Bunter the man who became his valet and chauffeur.<br /><br />Time period and an appreciation of history are not the only similarities between these two authors. Winspear writes a complex and satisfying tale that involves a plot filled with verismilitude and characters so real you will swear she must be writing nonfiction. Maisie Dobbs is a woman you would like to know better and come to care a great deal about, just as Harriet Vanes was that woman, and although the two come from different class backgrounds they are both difficult to get to know because they carry the pain of having suffered personal tragedy involving a financ&eacute;.<br /><br />But Maisie Dobbs is far more complex than Harriet Vanes. Maisie had a tutor who taught her about aspects of the world Harriet never knew or understood. While Harriet (ala Sayers) sulked about the things that were not available to her as a female member of Virginia Woolfe's class, Maisie went out and made her way in the world, acquiring the education that did not come her way naturally as a female member of the `Downstairs' class.<br /><br />Because she straddles two words-upstairs and downstairs-like Sherlock Holmes who disguised himself and went out and mixed with the common folk, Maisie has complex insights about the world around her. She recognizes the hard truth that many people suffer and that social justice is not available for all.<br /><br />While you will probably enjoy this book, you won't like the 'birds of a feather' who ruined many lives and who are -- as one character observes -- a band of harpies. If you haven't read MAISIE DOBBS, read that book first and get to know Maisie before you tackle this book. You are in for a treat.

THE AUTOMATIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND AROMATHERAPY is a relatively technical book that discusses in lay terms material the reader will find helpful if she or he is newly interested in essential oils, or seeks to know more about the finer aspects of the effects essential oils on the nervous system. Stromkins works with a group called Scents of Comfort that apparently operates out of British Columbia in Canada. According to Stromkins, the reader can obtain more information at  scentsoc@direct.ca.<br /><br />Janine Stromkins suggests that much of the material in her book was not available at the time of publication (1998). She certainly includes information I had not previously realized, but should have known. For example, she suggests a difference exists between the oil from Clove buds (with which we cook) and Clove flowers (which are milder and therefore less likely to be an irritant.<br /><br />Stromkins has organized the book so that the reader can locate an ailment or symptom and find oils that deal with it, or vice versa, locate an oil and examine the possibilities.  I would recommend doing both as she has also included information about when not to use an oil (pregnancy, high blood pressure, etc.).  One feature of the book I especially like is he table that explains what is meant by analgesic, carminative, cicatrisant, and other terms for which I lack a precise meaning or find somewhat unfamiliar. A good place to begin reading about this complex subject.	2004-11-11

Can one teach a Hyacinth Macaw to hold a spoon as the cover of Mattie Sue Athan's GUIDE TO THE WELL BEHAVED PARROT SUGGESTS? At this point as a parrot owner for two years, I never cease to be impressed with the repetoire of the parrot family.  I have stayed with the smaller parrots, my biggest and most recent purchase a Quaker Parrot who is as sweet and intelligent an animal as I have ever known appears to have many of the characteristics attributed to the larger birds.<br /><br />Ms Athan's book includes information useful for larger and smaller parrots.  In a nutshell so to speak, the book suggest that common sense actions make all the difference.  Birds need food and clean water of course, but they also need an interesting space to spend most of their day and excellent lighting or like humans they can develop seasonal disorders.<br /><br />Sometimes in spite of every thing you do to bring about a positive result, a bird will become cross and nippy.  The Lutino Cockatiel who lives with me has lately taken to nippy behavior when I put my hand in the cage in the evening.  Yesterday, I discovered eggs in the bottom of the cage. Seems Mr. Sweetie is a girl. Athan suggests that if I get Sweetiepie a mate she probably won't be a good companion bird. However, if I am patient, this nippiness will disappear as she grow older. The key ingredients for good bird behavior are human patience and perseverance.	2004-11-11

In addition to the use of body models to show which parts of the body (lympatic, circulatory or nervous systems) are affected by an essential oil, another novel feature of this book is the use of sidebars showing negative characteristics of essential oils.  Some oils can be skin irritating, others photosensitizing, and contraindications with oils exist and are grouped in one handy chart so that you don't have to flip around to discover you had best take care with lemon and hyssop if you have high blood pressure.  In addition, some folks may be sensitive to certain oils and one should proceed cautiously when using a \\"new\\" oil. The age of the individual, health conditions and other factors may make an oil you once used verboten. Not all oils can be consumed, even in small amounts.  Using an oil on the skin is a form of consumption.  The body absorbs whatever is placed on the skin, as any fan of Agatha Christie knows. Oils used singly might not harm but blended oils might produce a synergistic effect that can kill you. Oils are great, but make sure you are fully informed before you try them.  ADVANCED AROMATHERAPY will help you get there.	2004-11-11

This is the place to do a quick perusal to determine whether you want to know more.  Kathi Kaville, Director of the American Herb Association, has prepared a book for the beginner or the merely curious.<br /><br />Ever wonder about the ingredients in your favorite perfume?  For years, I've worn Channel No.5 and come close to adoring the scent on me and others. What's not to like- it consists of essential oils from sandalwood, vanilla, rose, ylang-ylang, neroli and bergamot and other fine oils. Of course, having worn this perfume for so long, as did my mother, I also know the perfumers use a very special rose (and plenty of it) and that the way the perfume is mixed affects the scent. I also know that the version sold in many department stores in the States is an inferior grade.  You have to buy the blend that has not been overly diluted with alcohol.<br /><br />One of the aspects of this book I truly appreciate is the overview of all the different uses of essential oils. Essential oils can be used medicinally for sure or as health and beauty aids.  You can also use them as household cleaning products. For example, you don't have to use moth balls to protect your woolens, you can use a blend of essential oils (including cedar oil) and they will smell better in the spring. Also, you can use oils in the dishwasher, the clothes dryer and other places around the house. They will impart a clean fresh smell that makes the visitor think you've been cleaning like mad.	2004-11-11

PARROTS by Mattie Sue Athan is a good short and concise manual to read if you don't have time to read any of the other excellent books by Athan and other bird experts (Matthew Vriends, Sally Blanchard). She covers all the basics about parrots - a family that includes everything from Budgies to Hyacinth Macaws.  Every section includes a `checklist' so if you are really in a hurry, you can skip over fully reading the chapters that cover purchasing, care, feeding, and housing.<br /><br />Quite frankly, I consider parrots or any pet for that matter such a worth while investment, I have read everything I can and talked to many experts to ensure the best possible outcome with my parrots. I don't have much use for this book, preferring instead Athan's more comprehensive book GUIDE TO COMPANION PARROT BEHAVIOR. However, if you have not yet made a parrot purchase and wish to become more informed before you do so, or,  if you are in a hurry, or have limited time for reading, this might be the book to throw in your luggage or carry in your brief case. Just remember, having an animal companion is something like raising children or a good garden - you get out of it what you put into it. If you can't take the time to become informed now, how will you manage later?	2004-11-11

GUIDE TO COMPANION PARROT BEHAVIOR is a great overview of this family and specifically provides something the specialty books only hint at, a good cross - comparison of the various parrot members from the \\"Old World\\", the \\"New World\\" and the \\"Pacific Rim\\".  I have 12 parrots and three canaries and find there are differences among and between them.  Some are more shy (Parrotlets), some are more agressive (Love Birds), some can stand cold (Quakers) and some must be kept warmer with individual heaters or lights.  Some are unreasonably sweet (Cockatiels) and some are little devils.<br /><br />Of course Athan might say she never met a companion bird that was a little devil. It is probably true that most anti-social behavior in companion parrots that were hand raised is bought about because the human failed in some way.  Athan show the reader how to establish and maintain a happy relationship with your companion bird and how to deal with the problems of feather chewing, screaming, and biting.	2004-11-11

This approach is immensely helpful for me as I am a Type A and my husband is a Type B. At a minimum I want to fix food that while beneficial for me won't harm him. Each recipe has a `bar code' at the top that shows blood types classified into three categories: `Highly Beneficial', `Neutral' and `Avoid.'  For example, buckwheat is highly beneficial for me and he should avoid it so I will fix pancakes for me when he won't eat them or cook something else like an omelet for him (he can have more eggs per week than I can and many more kinds of cheese). Days we want to eat together or evenings for that matter, I can fix oatmeal.	2004-11-06

Now, I might be a bit prejudiced because I live with 15 parrots and am a wild-bird watcher, but I find this book wonderful. Reading Alice Hoffman's writing is like gazing through a sun-catcher.  As the light moves through the colors,  it catches your eye and touches your heart in unexpected ways. Ever since her book PRACTICAL MAGIC, Hoffman has lead this reader into a mystical and  magical realm where all things are possible, and although truly sad things happen a heartlift is felt at the end if the tale. Hoffman has a deft touch, neither clobbering the reader with too much explanation, nor failing to inform. What happens to the bird? He isn't always black. Do the lovers get together, why yes, you discover a few pages later when their grandchildren tell their story.<br /><br />Each of the stories in this little book stands alone, yet all are woven into a fabric which includes the threads of singular lives who within the space of a few pages you come to care about.

I had a stroke in March and although I weigh more that I would like to, I am not about to jump on the Atkins diet, although a number of folks at work have recommended it. I was pleasantly surprised to see that someone has considered that not all people are eligible for this diet and written a book about the various blood types and food intake. Reading D'Adamo's book, which incorporates a good deal of information based on Asian medicine, leads me to believe the Atkins type diet works best for those who are blood type O.  I am an A and would do better on a Weight Watchers type diet which includes vegetables, fish, chicken and allows some sugar, although I use Stevia).  Makes sense to me as the WW diet has always worked for me (as long as I stay on it).  D'Adamo includes some `protocols' using essential oils, that one can follow to avoid certain types of health problems. Reading this book, you realize that the emphasis does not have to be on curing.

Vonn Harting includes a section on the use of oils, `Nosing Around\\", in which she links time of day and colors to oil usage. She says oils have different levels of volatility at different times of the day, and  \\"a volatile oil meant for a specific function taken at the wrong time of day goes to other parts of the body and oxidizes and creates free radicals.\\" Heaven forfend, as I use oils for various purposes, I found this section of the book most useful.<br /><br />Perhaps the time of day that you eat certain foods does affect weight gain.

The jacket of Mettitt Ruhlen?s book THE ORIGIN OF LANGUAGE suggests that he is one of the world?s foremost linguists, however, the contents of his book suggest he is a leader of one faction of linguists, and by his own words, not in the majority.<br /><br />Apparently, linguists form two camps (terminology from Colin Renfrew) ?lumpers? (those who subscribe to the Nostratic (Russian)-Petersen-Greenberg-Ruhlen perspective that all languages probably evolved from a common source which they can identify, hence the search for the ?origin?of language), and the ?splitters? (those who believe one simply cannot tell if there was a mother tongue because if it existed, the original language is so far back in time as to be unknowable.<br /><br />Ruhlen makes a fairly compelling case for his argument.  He takes the reader through a series of exercises designed to illustrate how with 10-12 words per language one can identify and classify (taxonomy) commonalities that reflect family groupings, and that using the root words for each classification one can then compare and aggregate families into supra-families or groupings. Most interesting to me are the links between languages of the Eskimo-Aleuts and other Indo-European groups.<br /><br />I was with Ruhlen until he began to discuss Sforza-Cavalli?s work with genetics, which he suggests supports his theory (it does partially). However, in his most recent book (2001) Sforza-Cavalli suggests the Indo-European homeland was probably in the steppes of Russia (Ukraine), not Anatolia, thus agreeing with the traditionalists (Child-Gimbutas), not Renfrew with whom Ruhlen associates himself in this book. Sforza-Cavalli?s synthesis suggests timing is the core issue regarding the movement of the nomadic Kurgan culture into Europe and the expansion of the peoples of agricultural Anatolia into Europe.	2004-10-22

For devoted fans who cannot get enough of Joseph Campbell's thoughts, I highly recommend THE FLIGHT OF THE WILD GANDER.  Although the book was first published in 1969, Campbell's thinking on the subject of religion and shamanism was well formed by then, and many of the ideas he discussed with Bill Moyers in the famous PBS interviews are more fully developed in this text. Also, if you have read his HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES you will find much of what he has to say in GANDER further distills and elaborates those ideas.  GANDER includes several related essays. Essays of greatest interest to me were also the most difficult to follow - `Primative Man as Metaphysician' `Mythogenesis' and `The Secularization of the Sacred' the latter essay summarizing and complementing the earlier essays.<br /><br /> Campbell describes first step of the process of individuation, as a growing awareness of a higher power accomplished by traveling a singular path versus merely accepting and acting on the teachings of a `religious' tradition associated with one's social group. He suggests that truly coming to know God is a frightening prospect(other people may persecute you as a heretic to say nothing of the sheer awe of the experience) and lonely experience(no one, neither priest or medicine man/witch doctor can do it for you) that one can only carry out by letting go through a `Shamanistic' experience comparable to those expeienced by American Indians, Eastern yogis, and other traditional people. Even after you have got yourself out on a limb, so to speak, you will only know finite things because `that which stands behind' the Masks of God is unknowable by humans.<br /><br /> Any summarization of this text I might provide is trite. You owe it to yourself to read this book and find your own path.  BTW, if you are searching for more material to continue your \\"Da Vinci Code\\" experience you will find that Campbell was aware of the search for the grail long before many of today's popular writers.riters.  <br />	2004-10-20

Each card in his ?Most Wanted? deck of cards holds a couplet or two of unrhymed meter filled with all sorts of mostly provocative images.<br /><br /> Encke has developed a book of poetry entitled, MOST WANTED: A GAMBLE IN VERSE, he plans to have published by the end of the year.  In the meantime, he has self published a card deck which displays some of the material in the book (selected images and lines of poetry).  The deck consists of high-quality playing cards illustrated with 1) pictures of fossils and 2) sculpture (i.e. the gouge-eyed Sargon II head once on display in the Baghdad museum raided when the capital ?fell? to American forces over a year ago); 3) Arabic decoration which is often script; and 4) various other features familiar to those who are exposed to relatively elite publications, like the New Yorker magazine, that publish modern poetry.<br /><br /> While I might try to interpret some of the cards, I will refrain from doing so as I do not consider myself a poet, or a critic of poetry.  I can appreciate lyrical passages however, so I can report that I found some of the cards quite intriguing.  Undoubtedly, they would provoke an energetic discussion in a poetry class.

This is just about the best mystery I've read in a while and approaches the quality of IN A DRY SEASON, which Robinson wrote a few years back.  The author does a great job of developing a tight plot with a few twists and turns that may surprise the most dedicated mystery lover. Robinson also further develops his the main characters Alan and Annie, as well as introducing a six-foot tall Jamaican immigrant female police officer who is bound to turn up again (one hopes!).<br /><br />Several mystery writers have used fire as a \\"character\\" in their novels including Patricia Cornwell, P.D. James, and Elizabeth , so you might think Robinson could not come up with something very different, but he does.  He crafts a new and from my perspective particularly horrible slant as he merges perspective of the victim, the art world, old and new friendships, and the ongoing development of the relationship between Annie and Alan.<br /><br />For ages, female mystery writers have created and directed the exploits of male investigators. Robinson turns the tables, very effectively as he explores the psyche of Annie who is becoming almost as likeable as Harriet Vane. Robinson shows that females don't have to be dumb bunnies who are rescued from the jaws of death after they stupidly play into the killer's hands - sometimes the male needs rescuing. I thoroughly enjoyed this mystery, reading past my bed time to finish it.	2004-10-12

In recent years, my approach to planting tulips and other small spring-flowering bulbs has been to dig down to the core ground underneath the raised bed I use for flowers, line the bed with composted cow manure laced with bone meal, and toss the bulbs in, letting them lie where they land. I usually buy an assortment of my favorite tulips including Negrita and Queen of the Night which I mix up, so come spring, I have a nice surprise when they emerge, but I cannot always tell which tulip is which.<br /><br />TULIPA by Baker and Lemmers will help me solve some of the mystery.  With hundreds of tulip photographs I can use in the identity parade, plus some descriptive text, I should be able to sort out the riot of colors come spring. TULIPA is an exquisite art book, in which the authors have used the Netherlandish floral paintings of the Golden Age for inspiration for their photographs.<br /><br />Tulips are featured in all their splendor, many owing a single page, while others are arranged around a page as if in a loose bouquet. Some are open ala Georgia O'Keefe, others closed demurely. The text of the book is sparse, with short essays by Michael Pollen, editor and garden author; Christopher Baker, photographer; and William Lemmers , member of the Tulip Committee of the Royal Bulb Growers Association (KAVB) and the Royal Horticultural Society in London.<br /><br />Lacey frilly, and in some cases not unlike an ice cream sundae.  What's not to like about tulips?  Given it's price, this is not the book to buy if you only want a practical guide to growing tulips, but it will make a lovely addition to your art library.	2004-10-12

I thought I knew everything a gardener could know about tulips until I read Theodore James book. TULIP has a few things to teach me. I bought several hundred bulbs last week - as I do every year - because something eats my bulbs. If I don't replace them in the fall, I don't get any blooms in the spring. I need all the help I can get fighting bulb poachers, and James has a few tricks up his sleeve concerning ways to outfox rodents and other wildlife seeking a bulb meal. I intend to try them this season.<br /><br /> The most pleasing aspect of this book for me, however, it that even if you don't plant tulips you can enjoy the book. Think of it as your \\"I dream of spring\\" winter book. James provides dozens of photographs of tulips growing alone or with companion plants, as well as text containing the names and heights of varieties of tulips as well as colors. Missing from the book are blooming times, but in my experience the blooming times of bulbs, per the Dutch bulb growers are never accurate as bulb blooming is always affected by the weather conditions in your neck of the woods. The individual bulb labels provided by your local nursery will include the nebulous blooming times if you really want them.<br /><br /> As far as I am concerned, pictures are worth a thousand words, and there are dozens of photographs of various tulips in bloom in this swell little monograph. I highly recommend this book for beginning gardener and old hands like me who love tulips.	2004-10-01

RATS by Richard Coniff, is a nice little picture book of rats - fun to look at and filled with lots of cute baby pictures.  Although the book includes some text, photos are it's strength - rats in burrows, rats in granaries, rats in brick walls, rats gnawing things they ought not be gnawing, dozens and dozens of rats crawling all over and out of the book. Cute white rats save lives according to the book. And some rats have been bred to be hairless (and look pink and pathetic). Did you know there was a little girl living in California who had 12 pet rats who sleep with her. She says her friends think she is weird.  This book is for weird kids.	2004-10-01

George Shenk's book on growing gardens in shade is still one of the best books out there for shade gardening, as far as I am concerned, but TAYLOR'S 50 BEST PERENNIALS FOR SHADE is also very useful. Besides, the Taylor book includes plenty of colorful  photographs.<br /><br /> If you're like me and you plant hundreds of tulips every year, in areas that will be plunged into shade when your neighbor's trees leaf out, you probably have discovered the value of \\"over-planting\\" perennial flowers (annuals generally require lot's of sun). Taylor's book explains how you go about planting covers for your bulbs, as they go dormant, by adding shade loving plants that will naturalize and hide the dying bulb foliage and thus hide the bulbs neatly until the following spring. (You should be amending the area with bulb food to ensure next year's bloom).<br /><br />  I have a particularly troublesome side yard, under a neighbor's Persian Walnut tree, where I have over-planted Solomon's Seal, Astilbe, and Creeping Woodruff (each one is pictured and described in this book) along with various bulbs and shade loving bushes such as Nandina and Skimmia, and I can testify that over-planting works well. Next year, I am going to try Tiarella Cordifolia (Foamflower) under the Foster Holly at the back of my yard. Taylor's book suggests about a dozen companion plants that will grow with the foam-flower including Bleeding Hearts which I love, and which are beautiful with white tulips.	2004-10-01

I bought THE STORY OF RATS by Anthony Barnett for my 14 year old granddaughter who is in an advanced placement science class at her high school, and who has an affinity for repulsive animals (she has a pet lizard she feeds live crickets).  I ended up reading the book before I handed it to her, and, what an interesting little book it is. RATS is a paperback with reasonably large type, so easy to read and filled with illustrations and photographs, but more than that it's filled with interesting material (even though it may not be up to AP standards).<br /><br />Did you know that not only do rats eat human foods such as corn, rice and other grain, but, according to Barnett, humans have been known to eat rats? (The Hindu God Ganesha is accompanied by a rat, but Hindus have a proscription against eating them.) When Britain ruled the waves, British sailors found rats appetizing alternative to hard tack or starvation (apparently, rats cannot board modern ships as easily as they could board the old wooden ships, so they are no longer part of the sea-faring cuisine). However, even today, some folks in the far-flung places the British ships visited and populated with rats still eat them. Photos show markets where vendors sell rats roasted and strung up by their tails along with other butchered meat.<br /><br />Barnett discusses the bad things rats do such as eat human food stores and spread noxious diseases like the Bubonic Plague and Hanta virus, as well as the good things rats do, such as become pets or lab rats. The author includes chapters discussing the use of rats in experiments, so if you are squeamish about animal testing this may not the book for you (most of the experiments involve psychological studies, not physical torture). Nuclear testing by the US Navy suggest that if and when humans destroy the planet, rats will probably survive. On the other hand, Chernobyl, deserted by humans after the nuclear accident a few years ago, has returned to it's natural state of \\"wilderness\\" sans `Rattus' who just can't get along without humans. So, it seems even if rats can survive manmade follies, they may perish because they rely on humans for food and shelter.`Rattus' who just can't get along without humans.

I've been using it for several years and recommend it as a good monthly guide for `Living the Magical Life' year round. If you want to learn more about keeping the Wiccan calendar this is a good source. You can begin living the magical life anytime, as each solar cycle brings a wonderful progression of the old holidays. WHEEL OF THE YEAR shows you that even in months without a major holiday, there are many opportunities to reconnect with the ground of your being and celebrate the seasons of Nature and the natural world.<br /><br />If you are inclined to connecting with the other world, Samhain is the best time to undertake living the spiritual life. October is nearly here, and thus Samhain and the New Year are upon us, making this is an especially good time to buy this book.<br /><br />The text is interesting and contains many nice illustrations. As the book is printed on soft paper with a soft cover, you can take it out doors where many practices are to be undertaken. It won't hurt the book one bit if you spill a little oil or candle wax on it.	2004-09-27

Imagine a website where solitary Wiccans can visit and learn from others as well as share their own experiences.  That's ALL ONE WICCA and you can learn about it in this book which is a compilation of material available at the time of publication (2001). MacMorgan writes that the project, began in 1993, has materialized into a publication and a website which she provides (along with many other sites).<br /><br />MacMorgan writes `Wicca is a religion based on the indigenous beliefs of the ancient peoples of Europe...[that] has a long tangled history with roots in the British spiritualist movements of the late nineteenth century.' Furthermore, `Wicca is a modern creation, a religion of an information culture, requiring that its members be gifted with the skill of telling myth from history and fact from metaphor....The dedicant, the initiate and the scholar know Wicca to be modern, while acknowledging the power and appeal of the stories claiming it as the oldest faith known to man.'  [humankind].<br /><br />This is a religious book and therefore not very spiritual.  It has been compiled by a committee, albeit an eclectic and electronic one, motivated to set standards for Wicca. I believe spirituality is very personal and cannot be reached by the consensus of the group.  If you are seeking a spiritual guide, you would be better served with THE HEDGE WITCH by Rae Beth, or WITCH ALONE by Marian Greene, or Scott Cunningham's book on the SOLITARY PRACTITIONER.<br /><br />This book does contain a `Grimoire' that includes much (agreed upon?) technical detail about Alters and Alter Cloths, Herbalism, Candles, Corn Dollies, Crystals and Minerals, etc. If you are looking for technical detail approved by a consensus, this may be the book for you.  Also, the copy of the US Constitution and Bill of Rights, which guarantee witches freedoms not readily available in past times may prove useful.	2004-09-27

A WITCH ALONE, by Marian Green is an excellent place to begin studying the oldest religion on Earth.  Green is an English witch who does not appear to follow any particular tradition - a solitary or hedge witch. Because many individuals follow the solitary path, material from others, especially one as experienced as Green is quite welcome.  A WITCH ALONE is comparable to works by Rae Beth (Hedge Witch), who is also English, and the late Scott Cunningham (Solitary Witch), and addresses the needs of those who follow an more or less eclectic path of their own making.<br /><br />Green covers basics such as descriptions of the Lord and Lady as well as the Sacred Cycles (pretty much determined by seasonal change in the Northern Hemisphere) and she also explains the circle between the worlds and the journey to the other world which dwell more on the spiritual aspects of witchcraft..<br /><br />Green demonstrates that if you search for it, you will find plenty of evidence concerning the old ways - or Pagan traces. Sections of her book explore the cumulative knowledge of other witches covering such topics as the healing arts, Moon magic, divination and dowsing, and the ancient wisdom passed along from the elders. She also provides good references at the end of every section.<br /><br />Although I've been studying this material for sometime, I found Green's book truly inspiring and filled with good suggestions. She lays out the steps one needs to take to learn the basics of Witchcraft one month at a time - over the 13 Moons that occur in any Solar year.	2004-09-25

Because I keep many birds, I've read many books on the topic by Matthew Vriends.  Vriends raises several kinds of tropical birds, visits their natural habitats, is involved in the preservation of wild birds and their habitats, and writes extensively on these topics.  He is also a PhD (Dutch born biologist and ornithologist).  I bought THE PARROTLET HANDBOOK in spite of the fact one reviewer said there was not much of interest about Parrotlets in this book, mainly because I have read so many of Vriends other books on other birds and found them helpful.<br /><br />THE PARROTLET BOOK is very interesting, but it is also geared to the breeder of this type of bird.  As the owner of two brother Parrotlets, I don't foresee joining the breeder group any time soon, even though Vriends makes a compelling case for becoming a breeder of Parrotlets who are under threat from the deforestation of the Amazon jungle.<br /><br />In spite of the book's bias - which I truly appreciate, it does include many helpful tips and a good deal of information about the various types of Parrotlets who are companions of people like me. For one thing the book helps one understand the origins the little birds whose ancestors come from South America and who seem be thought of by some as the little brother of the larger Macaw.<br /><br />My Parrotlet brothers have been hand raised from the egg stage and they are Soooo sweet. However, I am told the Parrotlet can administer a nasty bite should he be \\"wild\\" or displeased.  My birds perch on my finger (two at a time) and are a lot less messy than my Cockatiels and Love Birds. Maintenance-wise, keeping Parrotlets is a bit like keeping Canaries. However, they are as playful as my Senegal parrot.<br /><br />I found a really great article on Parrotlets entitled \\"True Confession-Parrotlet owners bring down the house with tales of pin-sized adventures\\" in the January 2004 issue of Bird Talk Magazine (if you keep birds or are thinking of doing so, subscribe to this magazine). I recommend both Vriends book and Bird-Talk magazine for the serious bird owner.ribe to this magazine). I recommend both Vriends book and Bird-Talk magazine for the serious bird owner.	2004-09-25

CLOSE TO HOME is a well-written mystery, or should I describe this book as two mysteries.  And, although the protagonist for both stories is Inspector Banks, a policeman in the village of Eastvale in Middle England, the series is not a police procedural as such.  Also, forensics while important are not described in all their gory detail. Rather the forensic results are used to shape the investigation.<br /><br />Mystery #1 involves the disappearance 30 years earlier (1965) of Alan Banks chum Graham, whose bones are recovered in the opening chapters.  Because Graham's body has surfaced (literally) the case is changed from \\"missing 16-year old\\" to murder.  It takes a while to determine the actual cause of death, but suffice it to say a corpse does not bury itself.<br /><br />Mystery #2 involves the current investigation into the disappearance of a 15-year old boy whose famous musician father committed suicide years earlier, and whose stepfather and mother are frantic with worry.<br /><br />To complicate matters, Banks is working on case #1 with his old girlfriend Annie, and case #2 with his new friend Michelle.  Both female detectives experience their moments of peril, but Banks is able to neatly juggle the investigations and both women as well as a trip to yesterday when Emma Peel reigned on tv and the Krays reigned on the East End of London.<br /><br />I liked the Inspector Banks book,IN A DRY SEASON, but I thought the novel that followed a silly excursion. In CLOSE TO HOME I find Inspector Banks is back on my list of good mysteries to read even if he is a bit macho for my tastes.. Give me Miss Marple any day.	2004-09-22

I found GENES, PEOPLES, LANGUAGES, by Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza a fascinating read by a noted scholar who has apparently made a significant contribution concerning the role the study of genetics can play in interpreting past and current social patterns. Sforza links what scholars currently know about the genetic composition of various population groups with what contemporary linguists understand to be historical language patterns. He also brings some archeological information into the equation.  In all three cases he relies on the syntheses of other researchers, such as J.P. Mallory. to complete his triangulation of perspectives: geneology-linguistics-archeology.<br /><br />All three disciplines suggest change occurs, if by change you mean that various genes, pots, and ways of speaking evolve, or are overrun by others or overrun others themselves.  What is of interest to Cavalli-Sforza is this: What can gentics tell us about change as well as its various outcomes?<br /><br />All the evidence seems to point to two possible causes of change, the first demic, the second cultural transmission. Demic change occurs when one group physically displaces another though migration or differential reproduction (births). Groups with violent ways may replace more passive groups. Groups with higher fertility may replace those with lower fertility. The second method of change, cultural transmission occurs when Group B adopts Group A's cultural practices - way of speaking, making pots, burial practices, and the like.<br /><br />Although he looks at change throughout the world, like many scholars, he focuses on the Indo-Europeans more than any other group.  Cavalli-Sforza's theory regarding them (which he supports to some extent with detail from various scholars) suggests Renfrew and Gimbutas might both be right. Renfrew apparently links the distribution of Indo-European languages with the spread of farming practices making it a Neolithic event originating from Anatolia around 10,000 years ago. If Cavalli-Sforza is correct, 5,000 years later the Kurgan Bronze-Age culture described by Gimbutus which some scholars suggest probably spoke a proto-Indo-European language overran agricultural areas settled by their own ancestors.<br /><br />Cavalli-Sforza's book is a fascinating study that those interested in the links between linguistics and geneology might consider reading.10,000 years ago.

I've had a copy of LYING WITH THE ENEMY in a stack of books next to my reading chair since it was first published in 1998. I finally read it to prove to myself that my addiction to book buying is justified. When I bought the book and read the information on the dust jacket, I thought it would prove to be one of those delicious treats one sometimes experiences reading works of fiction in late summer and it has. These days, I tend to find nonfiction and history more fulfilling than fiction, and when you reach my age and the \\"so many books, so little time\\" problem becomes evident, you don't want to waste time on an inferior book.  Lately, I've found reading mysteries disappointing lately because the current penchant for forensics can only take one so far. Plot is still as important to me as is character development, though many writers of mysteries have difficulty developing a plot.<br /><br />I used to be able to count on British mystery writers, but many of the good ones are dead, and the few I admire don't tend to crank out a book a year, thus I run out of fiction fairly rapidly. Tim Binding's novel is therefore welcome, and  I can honestly say that I don't feel that I wasted my time reading his book. I hope his protagonist Ned will turn up again in later books, not only because Binding left a number of loose ends remaining at the end of his book, but because Ned is a likeable fellow who is good to his mum. More importantly, Binding knows how to develop a tight and believable plot.<br /><br />Binding has selected a tumultuous era for the setting of his story, and done a great job of describing life on one of the channel islands during the Nazi occupation.  I don't know a lot about these islands, except that they are the last remnants of the British holdings in France dating from the days of Agincourt. His title is a double entendre involving lying as a form of making up untrue stories and lying as something you do in bed.<br /><br />Any illusions one has about the Nazis is dispelled by Binding's characterization of their behavior on Guernsey Island. Unfortunately, some of the local girls (including Ned's old love) find the Nazi officers attractive - to the point of virtually prostituting themselves. Undoubtedly, these girls will be treated by their countrymen as collaborators after the war. Most of the islanders are starving so it might be understandable that some women turned to prostitution for the purpose of acquiring food for loved ones. Smuggling and making a profit at the expense of those in dire straights is harder to understand, however. According to Binding, some of the girls who became involved with the Nazis may have thought of their relationships as a `step up' and/or a chance to escape the tedium of island living. Perhaps some of them thought they were \\"in love.\\"<br /><br />The novel reads well with hardly a glitch.  The only criticism I have is this, what mother would accept her son's involvement with a girl she detested before the war as a positive outcome after the girl had served as a Nazi concubine, even if the girl in question learned to cook!

Instead, she includes several photos of her hired hands doing all that tiresome stuff while she takes pages of photos of plants (a small \\"encyclopedia\\") and receipes (a small cook book).<br /><br />I was inspired by Creasy to try peppers in pots this past summer, and the Goddess must have smiled because all the plants behaved well and furnished a bumper crop of hot peppers for my pepper-loving Senegal parrot. So, for the first time ever -  inspired by Creasy -  I tried lavender in a clay pot and it worked well. Usually, my lavender plants mold from underneath because although the summers in the Washington DC area are usually hot, they are not dry like those in Provence where lavender excells. Clay pots are a good idea because the lavender plant sits above the ground away from the damp and any moisture falling from a watering can or the sky wicks away quickly. I have grown other herbs in pots - parsley, scented geraniums, basil, but never tried lavender until this year. I also grew several kinds of mint plants in both clay pots and the kind with a water well underneath, which is the only way to grow them as they are so invasive.<br /><br />I love Creasy's EDIBLE HERB GARDEN because in my estimation a picture is worth a thousand words, and as an experienced gardener, I don't need a lot of instruction. Creasy includes plenty of pictures that are useful to me because they give me design ideas. I can look at a garden photo, recognize plants and judge how much work is involved in realizing the scene depicted. Creasy doesn't really advise you concerning the amount of work involved to maintain a scene. She also grown herbs in a California climate.<br /><br />I've used other sources to help me learn how to grow herbs (Rodale in particular), and I've used Creasy's book to discover new and beautiful ideas for displaying culinary herbs in the perennial garden, as bedding plants or in pots.<br /><br />Creasy offers nifty vinegar, oil, and tea recipes using culinary herbs as well as items such as barbecued veggies on Rosemary skewers. Collect her series, but be warned, you will need a good \\"how to\\" book or your own personal gardener to achieve her results.s in a California climate.   <br /> <br />I've used other sources to help me learn how to grow herbs (Rodale in particular), and I've used Creasy's book to discover new and beautiful ideas for displaying culinary herbs in the perennial garden, as bedding plants or in pots.  <br /> <br />Creasy offers nifty vinegar, oil, and tea recipes using culinary herbs as well as items such as barbecued veggies on Rosemary skewers.

Pure and simple, for most of us PROVENÇAL HOUSE is a coffee table book filled with exquisite detail found in several dozen homes in the south of France. Author, Joanna Thornycroft, has classified the structures Andreas Von Einsiedel photographed into `Town', `Manor' or `Country' houses. Short on text and long on photos, the premise of this publication seems to be a picure is worth a thousand words.  Beginning with houses in the French Rivera and ending with Le Murier in hameau das Auvis, the author takes you on a trip through the land painted by Van Gogh and Pagnol.<br /><br />Some of the homes are \\"simple\\" cottages, others the more ornate domains of the landed gentry or super-rich movie star. My favorite shots were taken in gardens, and show flowers, pots and rustic gates across cobblestone walkways that lead to the lane or another room of the garden. Small details such as a decorative window latch covered with several centuries of paint, delft-like kitchen tiles, and a rooster weather vane, remind me of the land of the Cathars-those God-fearing people who lived in this land that once harbored them as heretics who may or may not have been far from God but who must have understood how blessed life can be when the sun shines.<br /><br />Architects may get some ideas from the recessed windows, the red tiled roofs, the stucco blue walls, and the marble bathroom fixtures, but the fabric-lined antique china cabinets, and nifty little accent touches in the various rooms depicted so lovingly make this book a must for interior designers and others seeking the \\"look\\" of Provence.	2004-08-25

I planted Charentais cantaloupe seeds this summer and grew a dozen or so fruits along with the Moon and Stars watermelon.  Both of these melons are antique varieties, so you won't find either in most supermarkets.  My grand children told me the Moon and Stars watermelon were \\"sweeter than the `big ones'\\", meaning those purchased by the side of the road or their local grocery store.<br /><br />One photograph in MELONS by Amy Goldman shows the Charentais filled with port wine and looking scrumptious. Goldman describes the melon as not very sweet. I ate the Charentais melons myself and found them quite rich, but not terribly sweet.<br /><br />The photo of a Charentais cantaloupe half filled with port wine pretty much informs you about the content of this book -- which is a pretty picture-book, not a gardening book. Don't get me wrong, I like lovely photos as much as the next person, and this book has plenty of them. However, I was looking for a gardening book and this book is not a \\"how-to\\" grow melons as far as I am concerned, but more of a \\"what to do with them after you have them in hand\\" (including looking at them).  What I know about cantaloupe growing I have learned through trial and error and from other sources such as neighbors.<br /><br />The one thing you may learn from this book is that most US consumers are aware of the existence of only a very few melons. Goldman wants you to know the world contains a diversity of these fruit. Some look like gourds, some like pumpkins and some like spaghetti squash. Goldman has included much anecdotal information about each of her featured melons.  Even though it won't help me become a better melon grower, I am glad I bought the book, because it contains a wealth of information about a favorite fruit. BTW if you want gardening information about growing antique melons, get the Seeds of Change catalogue through their web site.	2004-08-22

According to British linguist J.P. Mallory, their language was the proto-type of the languages spoken by over 2 billion people today. He also says the Indo-Europeans should not be confused with the `Aryans' claimed to be the progenitors of the Third Reich.  Mallory suggests the Indo-Europeans appear to have been a pastoral nomadic group who lived in the Pontic-Caspian region (Steppes of Mother Russia) sometime between the second and fifth millenium BC from whence they diffused.<br /><br />Mallory employs paleolinguistics to show how several dozen modern languages are descended from a `Proto Indo-European' mother tongue that came to dominate many other languages (not all) of the European-Asian land mass. He uses the work of archeologists to support of his theory.  In a nutshell, he mostly disagrees with Colin Renfrew, while mostly agreeing with Marija Gimbutas. Renfrew apparently has posited the idea that the changes archeologists see in the successive layers of excavated sites are the result of internal innovation and successive technological change (folks keep reinventing the wheel), where Gimbutas seems to subscribe to the notion that  hostile horse-riding kurgan-building invaders from the steppes mowed down the peaceful matriarchial civilizations of their neighbors. Mallory suggests paleolinguistics supports the idea that the languages of Europe and Asia which resemble each other did not spring up independently of one another and it is not likely that the civilizations that sustained them did either.<br /><br />Mallory theorizes the diffusion of the proto Indo-Euopean language from a Pontic-Caspian homeland took three paths, one through Anatolia and the Balkans, one through Northern Europe, and one East toward Iran and India ( the case for Anatolia, Greece and parts of Southern Europe appears to be very strong). He also suggests that the diffusion may have in part been the result of internal changes such as excessive population growth and climatic change that made agriculture a losing proposition. The social change resulting from the adaptation of more successful strategies for survival, such as pastoral nomadism may have led to a greater acceptance of the people who brought it about and their language.  Whatever brought about the change, Indo-European languages exist from Ireland to India today.<br /><br />Readers of Rian Eisler's CHALICE AND THE BLADE, and Merlin Stone's WHEN GOD WAS A WOMAN, will find their ideas are fairly well supported by Mallory's work.<br /><br />Mallory's arguments on behalf of his thesis are clear and compelling.  He methodically builds his case using the work of many scholars from both the East and the West.  Perhaps one of the wonderful outcomes from the `fall of the wall' in 1989, is the reunification of scholars from the old Soviet block with those of the West.change that made agriculture a losing proposition.

It probably helps to have some knowledge of The Maginogi and other Celtic tales, as well as the poems of Yeats and the writing of Robert Graves.  Understanding who Tristan and Isolde were and the Pre-Raphaelites won't hurt. Else, how can one put this convoluted tale in perspective?<br /><br />For example, just try to identify the protagonist.  Is it Daniel, the reporter on Sabbatical in modern day London? Or Val, the sedated grandson of the artist Comstock (who is yet another candidate) who knew Swinburne? Perhaps these men are all incarnations of someone else?  And what about the girl Larkin. Who is she? Drifter, bewitched, cursed, or a shape shifter?<br /><br />I bought this book and read it because a critic writing for The Washington Post Book World described it as `sublime'. I suppose that terminology fits, but it occurs to me that unless you are fairly well read in literature, and perhaps an English major, you may not get some aspects of this mysterious tale.<br /><br />I'm not sure I got it, but over and over throughout the book I experienced \\"recognition' or \\"deja vu\\" regarding various people, scenes, and items of interest to the protagonist of the moment (at least three deconstructed and overlapping tales are told) such as green absinthe, apple blossom flowers and owl feathers. One of the characteristics of myths is their episodic nature. They seldom make sense to the rational mind. They appeal to the artistic side of the brain.<br /><br />Do you know who Blodeuedd was?  Her name means flowers in the old Welsh. She was the wife Math and Gwydion of conjured out of flowers for Llew Llau Gyffes.  She did not choose her husband and when she fell in love with another, she was punished by being turned into an owl. The Pre-Raphaelites were interested in art created before Raphael rediscovered perspective i.e., art without perspective whose content reflected mythical tales and the hidden (occult) world visible only to those with eyes to see. They were also interested in Theosophy.<br /><br />LIke the mythmakers of old,Elizabeth Hand employs skillful use of language (incredible metaphors), characterization, irony, and other narrative devices.  As a result, she has written a fine and scholarly bit of literature.

WHEN GOD WAS A WOMAN by Merlin Stone explores the controversy surrounding Eve by examining the links between the Old Testament text and archeological  and linguistics research conducted in the 20th century. Although you may not agree with Stone's premise, interpretation of the Old Testament text, or conclusions, if you are one of Eve's daughters you owe it to yourself to learn more about her and how she may have been maligned by the ancient Levite priests when they constructed text such as Genesis, Deuteronomy, and other Old Testament books.<br />Stone's work has been referenced by feminist writers Margaret Starbird, Sue Monk Kidd, and Lynn Picknett, and her chapter \\"Unraveling the Myth of Adam and Eve\\" presents a compelling argument and an interesting perspective, especially when contrasted with Elaine Pagels' ADAM AND EVE AND THE SERPENT, and Joseph Campbell's mythology works.<br />I enjoyed this book very much.  As one who studied the Bible many years and found the murder and mayhem in the Old Testament quite disturbing, I was intrigued by Stone's insights which caused me to reflect on the folks the Hebrews fought.  Perhaps they were not nearly so wicked as we were taught to believe ages ago.  On top of that, the criticism of women in the Old Testament may be totally unjustified as it was directed towards non-Hebrew women who were forced marry the male Hebrew victors after they had killed their kinsman. In other words, when the walls of Jericho fell, who died?<br />This book is so stunning, I am amazed that Stone had the courage to write it, let alone that a publishing house published it.  If nothing else thia book is an example of having the intellectual courage to address a verboten subject that could lead to a Christian fatwah if Christians did such things. Think of Merlin Stone as Christianity's answer to Salmon Rushdie.  Only this is not a work of fiction, however speculative it may be.<br />The only complaint I have concerns the sourcing of statements.  As it happen, I know a bit about the Bible so I could follow Stone's arguments.  Unfortunately, she offers direct quotes in some cases, but does not in others.  One unfamiliar with the Old Testament might find Stone's book challenging.As it happen, I know a bit about the Bible so I could follow Stone's arguments.

And so began (or similarly began) one of the great classics...WUTHERING HEIGHTS.  Foster explains why the weather in a novel is a very important clue.  Sunshine and clouds affect mood and the classical writers are adept at using atmospheric pressure to evoke mood.<br />Foster explains that other literary devices have been used to effect mood, attitude, and feelings of commiseration ever since our forebears sat around the campfires and told each other entertaining tales.  Shakespeare may have been original, but he was also a master of understanding what worked for other authors from whom he borrowed much.  A number of great works written since Shakespeare use his devices including subtle references to the Bible and the Greek Classics.<br />One wonders in an age not prone to studying the Bible as literature or Latin in high school, how much is lost.

I'm still trying to find the definitive pepper book, and TOO MANY PEPPERS by Dave De Witt is not that book.  I began growing hot peppers this season, and would like to find a book a step up from the EDIBLE PEPPER GARDEN by Rosalind Creasy which although an interesting and colorful book with garden tips and a few recipes is not nearly comprehensive enough.  DeWitt's book includes a few pages on growing peppers, but is more about what to do with peppers after you have them in hand.  Unfortunately, the peppers one purchases are not nearly as fresh and good as those one can grow.<br />This is a nice little cookbook (less than 100 small pages), spiral bound with recipes printed on pages that will withstand splatters. The book covers freezing peppers (mash, sauce chutney, Gazpacho, stew); making powders, pastes, and sauces; smoking peppers (salsa, hot sauce, Chipotle, baked beans); pickling peppers alone or in combination with other vegetables such as squash, onions or beans; and preservation in the form of vinegars, oils, liquors, condiments such as Jalepeno Mustard and jelly and Chile butter.<br />I have to give the book three stars because there are no color photographs.

Miller includes many colorful photos of chiles, but this book is no encyclopedia. Furthermore, although I found the book interesting, I also found it difficult to use. He divides the text into `fresh chiles' and `dried chiles' followed by a few pages of recipes, but rather than see the same chile shown over and over on several different pages in it's green, red, fresh and dried stages, I would have preferred to have seen various peppers in the same family clustered together so that I could learn to distinguish among them. In his brief overview he explains the origins of the chile pepper -- that it is not in the family that produces the black peppercorn (piper nigrum) but rather all chiles are descended from a South American plant that was dispersed by birds and then cultivated and spread further by humans.  <br />Miller's recipe section, which he describes as a good cross-section of various chile dishes,  includes one for Jalepeno ketchup.  Now that should wake up any hot dog!! Most interesting, however, is the recipe for Mole Roja, from the Oaxaca and Puebla area of Mexico known as the `Land of the Seven Moles.' Miller explains that some moles contain no chocolate (this one does, however, as well as dried plums or cherries to enhance the flavor of the ancho and mulatto chile peppers). Mole Roja is best served with fowl such as turkey. So, try this instead of cranberry sauce next Thanksgiving!	2004-07-04

The CHILE PEPPER ENCYCLOPEDIA by Dave DeWitt, should be an encyclopedia, right?  I picture an encyclopedia about peppers as a comprehensive book with many sections each illustrated with a colorful photo of the subject.  That is not the case with this book, however. DeWitt's encyclopedia is yet another cookbook. He included many recipes which he has organized origin not by dish, or type of pepper.<br />For example, \\"A\\" is for Africa and African dishes such as \\"South African Hot Lamb Curry\\" which include American peppers and probably originated with natives from India using British lamb. \\"A\\" contains a section on `Aji' peppers (of interest to me), but I did not find the Aji pepper I grow in my garden and want to know more about (Aji Colorado). From Africa, we move onto Amazonia, which digresses into African slaves and Catholic saints.<br />DeWitt is obviously quite knowledgeable about peppers.  I just wish his editors could help him get organized.

Basically, THE WHOLE CHILE PEPPER BOOK, by DeWitt and Gerlach includes a history of the chile (how it left the New World and conquered the Old World) four colorful pages of photos of various chile peppers, and lots and lots of exotic recipes.  I bought this book thinking it would include much more detail on raising peppers in the garden than Rosilind Creasy's book THE EDIBLE PEPPER GARDEN, but for my purposes it is not as useful. I don't really need more recipes, I need a book that shows me photos of various peppers and explains their basic uses.<br />I fould the book more or less interesting - a narrative that explains how the pepper moved from area to area and how the locals in varous areas incorporated the new vegetable into their native cuisines, often developing pepper children who differed from their American ancestor. For example, while Africa had an affair with Paprika, Southeast Asia incorporated peppers into everything from curry to sate.  So, according to DeWitt and Gerlach, the American pepper is the ancestor of those hot foreign dishes you eat in Thai, Chinese, and other ethnic restaurants.<br />I am puzzled as to why anyone would publish a book about something as colorful as the pepper and include so few color photos, however, the book includes many black and white photos and illustrations, along with plenty of text.

I recently  expanded my bird collection to include two canaries and as I knew little about these pet birds, I purchased several books on the subject from Amazon. According to Barron's THE CANARY HANDBOOK which I have found the most useful of the four books I bought, there are three kinds of canaries: \\"type\\", \\"song\\" or \\"color\\". My birds (two bright yellow brothers) are supposed to be song canaries, but according to the breeder, the dominant one will do most of the singing. Apparently, girl canaries don't sing but not all boy canaries can carry a pleasant tune.<br />Barron's handbook is filled with many up-close photos showing the many different kinds of canaries as well as various stages of development including breeding tips. In a charming chapter entitled 'Understanding the Canary' the handbook shares some history of the domesticated bird along with a little bit of information about canaries in the wild.  The handbook says the canary has been domesticated for five centuries and breeding and marketing these birds via peddlers once formed the chief industry of the Harz region of German Black Forest.<br />The handbook includes a section on `Feeding Canaries' and discusses \\"color\\" feeding.  Beginning in 1870, cayenne pepper was mixed with canary seed to improve the red color of the Norwich and Yorkshire canaries.  Later on, breeders and owners discovered sweet red peppers were more effective. The authors of this handbook suggest mixing canthaxanthin in egg yolk.  This handbook includes many similar tips for helping your canary obtain the best food and care.	2004-06-27

In \\"Life with a Canary\\" von Frisch discusses diet.  He suggests storing bird seed in the refrigerator in tight fitting containers. The cool dry air keeps the seed from spoiling, however, if you are like me with 11 birds, you may not have room for much of anything else. His list of things to add to the bird's menu includes old favorites such as spray millet and home-cooked treats.<br />The photos in this book are amazing with many action shots.

This little book is a good basic volume with diet, grooming and other health care tips including a section on various ailments such as mites, cysts, and canary pox.  In various sidebar sections Grindol includes a recipe for pellet muffins, the benefits of formulated diets and and how to turn seeds into nutritious treats by sprouting them. Her sections on cages and cage supplies, as well as perch choices are probably cover some of the most important aspects of canary ownership.  Apparently, canaries can become ill if they sit on the same sized perches all day.<br />I did not find this book any more useful than the Barron's handbooks on canaries although it does include a few different features. My book is a hardback and will probably last longer than the books with paper covers. This book includes many charming photos as do the other books I purchased - however, two of them show a canary with a Siamese cat, which made me wonder about the advisability of letting a cat so near a canary, even for a photo op. The book includes a description of the most common canary, the `German Roller' which apparently has the most beautiful song. A useful feature of this book is the list of Internet sites you can visit if you really want to investigate canaries in detail.	2004-06-27

Books	5	3	3	N	N	Buy this book for the young pet owner....	CANARIES BY Sigtun Rittrich-Dorenkamp provides the reader with \\"basic information to help you purchase and care for your new pet\\".  As I just bought two new canaries a few weeks ago, and knew virtually nothing about at the time, I found this book and the other books about canaries I purchased from Amazon most helpful. Unlike some of the other books, however, this little volume appears to be developed for children with larger type as well as plenty of cute photos.<br />Particularly helpful for the new bird owner is a \\"cleaning schedule\\" which advises the reader on daily, weekly, monthly, and \\"every few months\\" tasks to carry out on behalf of a feathered companion. As children tend to find housekeeping responsibilities the downside of pet ownership (as do many adults), clear instructions on how to care for your canary to keep him healthy and happy should prove somewhat encouraging for the young bird owner. The book also includes plenty of additional information about how to solve problems, and how to identify bird ailments and prevent in the first place them with proper hygiene and diet. As a gardener, I found the photos of canaries munching dandelion greens most amusing.  I've always wondered what to do with those pesky weeds.	2004-06-27

In THE EDIBLE PEPER GARDEN, Rosalind Creasy demonstrates a variety of ways to grow both sweet and hot peppers (beds along the driveway,in the flower bed next to the street or in containers).  I very much appreciated some of her tips about pepper plants such as warning the reader that temperatures can be either too hot or too cool, especially for potted pepper plants, and that PH balanced soil is important for happy peppy plants. Apparently, not only can pepper fruits experience sunscald, the pepper plant roots can literally be cooked on the south side of the pot. And, pepper plants like soil on the sweet side.<br />I knew very little about hot peppers before 2004 (I'm growing them for my parrots who likes them very much), but I found most of what I need to know in Creasy's book. This spring, I purchased six pepper plants from Seeds of Change, and promptly mixed them up when I repotted them. Creasy includes many great photos and a section with pictures with text descriptions of the main pepper plant categories, so thanks to her I think I've just about sorted them out. This book is not an encyclopedia however, and as a result of my carelessness, I am still trying to determine the identity of two of the plants. Type matters, apparently, as Creasy says some peppers are best harvested green while others should be allowed to ripen. If you are interested in growing peppers in pots or garden beds, this is a great place for the novice to begin.	2004-06-26

Who was this Mary and why are there conflicting views of what she might have been?  While some see her as the unacknowledged bride of Christ, Picknett suggests MM was an Egyptian priestess schooled in the mystery religions of the time which involved the pracice of 'hieros gamus' or ritual sex. Picknett says MM might have been Jewish as there were plenty of Jews living in Egypt at the time JC is supposed to have lived and preached. So MM could have been both Jewish and a practioner of the Egyptian mystery religion. The New Testament indicates that the `Holy Family' moved to Egypt when JC was quite young, so he too may have become involved in the foreign religion.<br />Picknett uses a variety of sources to make the case that JC was an Egyptian magus, not unlike Simon Magus, and perhaps John the Baptist. The Egyptian religion was preoccupied with life and death unlike the Jewish religion of the time. According to Picknett, the Talmud suggests JC was an itinerant 'Egpytian' preacher leading people astray.<br />In TEMPLAR REVELATIONS, Picknett and her co-author Clive Prince, demonstrated a keen interest in John the Baptist, who was thought to be the `patron' of the Knights Templar. In MM she revisits and expands this theme and re-examines the possible connections between the KT and the Mandaeans of Southern Iraq who practice a Johnnite religion centered on Baptism.<br />At times while reading this book I thought Pickett stretched her material a bit thin to make a point. On the other hand, she raises some conflicting, disturbing and unresolved notions such as why does New Testament writing depict JC as both the advocate of the meek and mild (more feminine), and the hot tempered fellow who wrecked the Temple in Jerusalem and cursed the fig tree (more masculine)? Could it be that JC's followers combined the Johnnite message of LOVE with that of the militant JC after John died? Most disturbing of all, Picknett suggests the JC followers may have had a role in John's demise. Leonardo da Vinci apparently despised JC and revered John the Baptist. Pickett suggests Leonardo may have been aware of a rivalry between the two that cost John his life.ing of all, Picknett suggests the JC followers may have had a role in John's demise.

Dorothy Morrison's BUD, BLOSSOM &amp; LEAF contains something old, something new and some things borrowed from other gardeners, as well as a good deal of original material based on her own experiences. She combines all these bits of gardening wisdom and lore into a practical but fun book that has more to do with using herbs than growing them. I appreciate the old bits, such as being reminded of the multiple uses of Chamomile, a natural antibiotic remedy and a soothing balm, and new information seldom found in gardening books - such as how to make wine from excess fruit and other plant materials.  The best part of her book is entitled \\"Mother Nature's Household\\" where Ms Morrison offers ideas and suggestions for everything from `Cleaning with Herbs' to `Herbal Beauty'.  She includes recipes for products for the bath and boudoir, as well as the kitchen.<br />If you are a new gardener, you will probably want to purchase another gardening book that goes into greater depth concerning the care and feeding (growing) of herbs, as Ms Morrison's discussion of gardening techniques is directed to the experienced gardener and, not the novice. There are a number of herbal gardening books on the market, for example Rodale'S ILLUSTRATED ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HERBS, which is a good place to begin to learn more about herbs. Herbs are generally annuals (Basil, balms, Borage) or perennials (Lavender, Artemisia, Echinacea) so bed preparation is similar to that undertaken for flower gardening. However, every experienced gardener knows not all flowers have the same requirements. For example, if you are going to raise lavender, it helps to know that it prefers dry alkaline growing conditions.  Like most flowers, most herbs require lots of sun (many come from the Mediterranean), so you'll have better luck growing herbs on a sunny balcony, than in a shady moist location.	2004-06-06

SECRETS OF THE CODE by Dan Burstein describes itself as the unauthorized guide to Dan Brown's THE DAVINCI CODE, apparently because Brown has a website that acts as the \\"official\\" guide for readers interested in the source material he used to construct his book. However, rather than point to a long list of books, many of which I have read, Burstein's book also focuses on passages of those books that are relevant to the script of Brown's book.<br />Most amazingly Brown's book did not include as much as it could have. Although he may have relied on some sources more than others, it becomes apparent on reading Burstein's book that Brown (and Burstein) faced an almost overwhelming amount of material.<br />Burstein has excerpted relevant passages from many works, interviewed a notable list of authors including Dan Brown, and included material from articles about Brown's book or some aspect of the book found in various respected publications.  Probably one of the most interesting sections includes reflections, comments and articles by individuals who currently belong or have belonged to Opus Dei. Theologians, art historians, and at least one \\"symbologist\\" have been included in the list of folks to comment on varous topics in the book.<br /><br />In one section, the journalist David Shugarts responds to questions he has previously researched concerning the technical aspects of the plot. He reports on \\"geographical positioning systems (GPS),  maps, automobiles, logistics, aircraft, weapons and computer search engines, and other technological plot elements. According to Shugarts, Mr. Brown got many thing right and several things wrong.<br /><br />I liked this book very much because I found it informative without being judgmental, and sections of it are as interesting as the original Brown book.

Campbell spent years building his vast knowledge of myths and thankfully, committed much of his distilled knowledge to writing. OCCIDENTAL MYTHOLOGY is one of three major works the author compiled about the history of the myth and is part of the THE MASKS OF GOD series. In OM Campbell reinforces the compelling case he made to Bill Moyers and through his writing, that we need to look beyond the masks if we would truly know `the thing that stands behind'. In the`Masks of the Gods'series, Campbell synthesizes much of the archeological, linguistic, and theological material discovered and analyzed in the 20th Century, to elaborate and modify many themes found in Sir James Frazier's GOLDEN BOUGH written almost a century earlier.<br />Campbell organizes his series historically across space, showing how the beliefs of one age and place influenced those of another. In OM he discusses in great depth and with scholarly wisdom how the religions of the Levant were shaped by internal and external forces, and how in turn religious movements that originated in the Middle East interacted with the beliefs of the various peoples of Europe. Religious beliefs apparently do not travel one-way. Among other aspects of religious transmission, Campbell discusses the process of  `mythological defamation' the priests of newer religions employ to attempt to demonize the old religions. Using art forms such as statuary and painting, Campbell also demonstrates how themes and ideas from older religions survive in the guise of the newer religion as elements of the older religion become incorporated into the newer religion (if you can't demonize it, incorporate it). Some of the more interesting transformations in the West involve the snake, the Goddess, and the risen Lord, which have an ancient history.<br />After revealing how the attributes of one religion after another became incorporated in a succeeding religion (Christianity and Islam are covered), Campbell summarizes his thesis. It seems a core theological issues is this: If a Higher Power exists, is it (he/she) transcendent or immanent?  The transcendent God is \\"out there\\" while the immanent God is \\"down here\\".  In other words is God, part of his or her creation?  Thousands of people have died fighting over this and other difficult questions.Campbell summarizes his thesis.

Riane Eisler's CHALICE AND THE BLADE is one of those books that had to be written. In it, she asks \\"Did humans at some point in history create a culture that was far more civilized than the so-called civilizations moderns have been and are experiencing?\\" And, more importantly, can we do it again? Her answer is a resounding YES and YES and YES. To illuminate and support her thesis Eisler presents the reader with a comprehensive and thoroughly researched synopsis of some of the most salient and scholarly material on this subject published in the late 20th Century when Joseph Campbell was completing an academic career researching and writing about myths, James Mellaart had been excavating and writing about Catel Huyuk, and Elaine Pagels was beginning to rock the theological world with her research on the Gnostic gospels and the Nag Hammadi scrolls.<br /><br />Eisler's work was first published in 1987, when the right-wing lock on US society was only beginning to choke the great social movements that had been ignited in the preceding decades. These movements were initially viewed as somewhat antithetical to the 'Archie Bunker' school of thought and the mainstream academic views promulgated by conservative Western scholars (Jewish, Christian, and Islamic).  Main steam scholars had long ago settled on an androcentric canon of beliefs and world view that saw males as superior to females, and promoted the manly enterprises of war and destruction of the natural environment. The scholars Eisler cites expressed different and non-canonical points of view. Eisler explores their works and the works of others as she examines the art, social mores, beliefs, and technology of the Neolithic Age.<br />According to Eisler, the extant information supports the notion that humans once worshipped a Mother Goddess who was viewed as the source of life unlike the later Gods who were War Gods and all about death and dying.The followers of the Mother Goddess were probably centered in Eastern Europe and Western Asia, particularly Crete. Their cultures were destroyed by blade-wielding fiendish tribesmen whom Eisler names `Kurgans'. These Kurgans, were herders who entered the agrarian areas from the periphery and destroyed what they found. Eisler suggests the Kurgans and their militaristic namesakes have controlled the area as well as the rest of the world ever since, although brief periods of gylanic (female, Humanistic) resurgance occurred in periods demarcated by Christian love (agape), Renaissance Humanism and the 20th Century &quot;New Age&quot; movement.<br />I found this book illuminating and provocative. It seems &quot;He who lives by the sword (blade) dies by the sword&quot; and the sooner we change that the better.

I found Patricia Telesco's GARDENING WITH THE GODDESS a small disappointment. Although she has obviously done her homework in reviewing relevant material about various culturally diverse female divinities from around the globe, her choices beg the question of \\"Who or what exactly is the Goddess\\", and \\"Who determined the deities described in this text had acquired the status of THE Goddess\\"?  In Part 1 \\"Goddess-Centered Thinking\\" Telesco attempts to briefly describe what she means by \\"The Goddess\\" but those unfamiliar with the Goddess may find the information insufficient. With few exceptions, little of historical import is known about many of the female deities Telesco includes, so one wonders how she became informed about what sort of garden a specific \\"goddess\\" would keep if that goddess kept a garden. Perhaps she  received telepathic transmissions, if so I wish she would share as much. Having had these sorts of experiences myself while working in the garden, I can accept that one may find herself creatively inspired without understanding why or by whom.<br />The dearth of critical gardening information regarding how to create, establish and maintain each garden make the book impractical, although the experienced gardener may find inspiration. Telesco says she is an experienced gardener, but unlike mzny other gardeners-turned writers, she reveals little of practical use based on her experience. Telesco alludes to her failed attempts at gardening with phrases about overwatering and starting seeds too late, but these vague statements may baffle the unintiated trying to decide \\"do I buy seeds or bedding plants?\\" &quot;Do I accept a snippet of plant life offered by a neighbor?&quot; Once I decide wether I am a seed person or a bedding plant person (which limits my choices) which plants do want?<br />Telesco's suggested garden designs for specific various goddess gardens are mostly unhelpful. Where another garden writer might have included illustrations showing how one might lay out a bed and fill it, she does not.  Instead, she suggests plants and colors, and shapes and leaves the novice gardener imagining all one has to do to garden is select plants.You can figure out how to arrange everything yourself and whether or not the plants you choose will survive in your yard or even grow together well. There are much better books on gardening available. For example, THE HERBALIST'S GARDEN by Shatoiya and Richard de la Tour combines helpful gardening advice and spiritual inspiration that can be combined to create something for the Goddess.

Ed Smith is a serious gardener.  His approach to vegetable growing is best suited to half acre gardens in the northern areas of the United States. Smith lives and gardens in Vermont and judging by the contents (great photos as well as text) of his book, THE VEGETABLE GARDENER'S BIBLE, I suggest his gardening effort constitutes year-round full-time employment for him. I am a dedicated urban gardener, but one with a  less than one-eighth (&lt;1/8) acre plot of land, much of which is covered by a house and driveway. I cannot begin to use most of the material in Smith's book, however, even for urban gardeners like me, Smith provides much useful information.<br />My experience has shown that vegetable growing in the city has one advantage over growing vegetables in the hinterland...most of the pests that plague the countryside have not moved to town...yet!  When I grew green beans on a half acre plot in the country, I fought a daily war with bean beatles.  I've yet to see a bean beatle in my urban back yard.  On the other hand, the larvae of the Monarch Butterfly found my parsley last year. Smith's section on pests includes something I have not seen in other gardening books..a picture of Monarch Butterfly larvae or Parsley Caterpillers as Ed calls them, munching away.<br />Smith is an organic gardener so he advises pest control methods that deter unwanted visitors without damaging the larger envirnoment. He also advises moving the Parsely Caterpillar out of harms' way when you battle other insects. However, the birds living in my yard consider Parsley Caterpillars a delicacy, much to the horror of my granddaughters who watched the pretty little green and yellow striped caterpillars with interest last summer as they grew bigger and bigger until one day they were discovered to have been eaten by a feathered predator who left only a few body parts in his wake.<br />Smith includes much that will be of interest to anyone setting out to grow vegetables for the fifteenth or first time. Although most of us don't have a green house for winter gardening, most of us do have a sunny window sill that can be used to germinate seedlings for transplanting. Most of us can compost (check out WormWoman.com on the Internet if you live in an apartment).<br />Smith advocates growing vegetables in (W)ide rows, (O)rganically, in (R)aised beds with (D)eep soil.

As the new owner of six love birds, I find THE LOVE BIRD HANDBOOK by Vera Appleyard, indispensible.  I now know that my little birds are a great choice of parrot(two toes back and two toes front and a `horned beak'). I like the colorful antics of the larger birds, but am afraid of the bigger parrots with their tough beaks.  Love birds are funny little guys who figure things out pretty quickly and each of my love birds cost about one-fourth the amount I paid for my Senegal Parrot (who is a great little bird).<br />After reading Appleyard's book, I figured out that although three of my `non-masked' love birds appear different from one another they are all variants of the peach-faced love bird from Central Africa. As they purportedly came from the same clutch this makes sense(the bird shop owner was a confused man, i.e. not sure what his partner/wife had done).<br />Appleyard's book contains useful information on love bird diet and care as well as things to avoid. She also indcludes a section on \\"What not to do, ever.\\"  As all birds can become nippy, I find her advice timely, not only with regard to the lovebirds, but with regard to the other companion birds that live with me. I have been bitten on more than one occasion, and Appleyard has many useful suggestions about how to \\"nip\\" this behavior in the bud.<br />I've kept birds for about two years and read dozens of books on parrots and parrot behavior, and can recommend this book to the novice.  It contains useful introductory information found in other books and combines and distills useful ideas specifically about love birds. I was thinking of buying six parakeets (budgies) before I bought my love birds, but I am happy I read Appleyard's book and purchased love birds instead.  They are just as colorful as parakeets, and they will live a lot longer.  And, they are sweet little birds, very affectionate with each other when they aren't \\"beak fighting.\\"...just like human kids.	2004-04-11

As the owner of six new love birds, I found Matthew Vriends LOVEBIRDS A Complete Owner's Manual relatively helpful. I knew little about love birds when I read the book and know a only a little more now. The book did not answer many of my questions, though it raised a few points about love birds I would never have asked. For example, the caption of one photograph says the coloration of the peach-faced lutino lovew bird is sex linked, however, I could not discover which sex was linked. This book is not nearly as comprehensive (or thick) as the title leads one to believe nor is it filled with as much information as other books in the `Barrons' series on parrots including the Senegal and African Grey, however the book  is filled with lovely photographs and a number of illustrative drawings.<br />LOVEBIRDS includes text and maps describing the origins of various types of birds in the family. Vriends apparently owns love birds which he maintains in an outdoor aviary. He includes a good deal of information about keeping love birds in outdoor aviaries, so some of his information such as dealing with frozen toes and vermin that attack birds living aviaries (ticks, rats, mice, etc.) as well as raising love bird babies, may be less than useful for folks like me who keep birds indoors and want to understand \\"beak fighting\\" know in advance that clipping their little wings may make it difficult for them to move around an aviary.  Although these cute little guys are accused by some of being less than loving, my short experience has shown me that plenty of seed cups and members of the opposite sex alleviates some of the rivalry.	2004-04-10

However, if you know nothing, you will not know which specialty book to buy.  For example, are you thinking about a small bird or a large bird?

Did you know that \\"budgies\\" (a.k.a. parakeets) and love birds were types of parrots?<br />Coloration, characteristics such as an affectionate nature, and length of life differ across parrot genuses. According to Doane, while most Cockatoos like to be handled, most Cockatiels are not interested in human affection.  The specially bred colors such as Lutino Cockatiels may not live as long as birds with the natural coloration. Budgies are most susceptible to cancer (all of them are predisposed to it apparently) and thus most budgies have relatively short life spans.

In HOLISTIC CARE FOR BIRDS, authors McCluggage and Higdon address preventative care as well as spiritual and emotional healing.  They begin with a brief overview of `bird keeping' - Different birds have different needs..Not all birds like to be petted while others may become miserable without constant affection. Sometimes the difference is species specific, other times it is related to the bird's treatment by previous owners.<br />Obvious physical problems may send you scrambling to the vet, but there are remedies you can keep on hand to deal with life's stresses and less serious physical injuries. For example, according to the authors, mild camomile tea in the bird's water bowl offers a soothing aperitif following a bad \\"out-of-cage\\" experience with the family dog or as a palliative for feather picking.  Aloe juice used to treat human skin problems as well as Vitamin E and C can also be used to address bird wounds inflicted by cage mates.<br />The authors address a range of treatments for ailments as diverse as sore feet and broken feathers to heart disease.

I've just spent several days carefully reading Deborah Crombie's AND JUSTICE THERE IS NONE. I would be less than honest if I suggested the book was not entertaining but this book is not as well written as some of her earlier tales.  I have read all of Crombie's books and really liked some of the earlier ones. However, it occurs to me that unlike mysteries by James or Christie, one cannot pick up a Crombie mystery and understand what is happening with regard to the two main characters Gemma James and Duncan Kincaid (i.e. the book does not stand on it's own two legs!!). JUSTICE is particularly cumbersome in this respect not only because the plot is cumbersome, because Gemma became pregnant in a preceding book and Kincaid discovered he had a son of whom he had no earlier knowledge in either the preceding novel or the one before.  Even given exposure to these two characters over the course of several novels, I am a bit puzzled as to what they see in each other. Maybe it's all physical attraction.<br />Where is this place? According to her earlier book jackets, Crombie is apparently an American who lived in the UK for a short period and travels there often. I had the feeling the entire time I was reading this book that Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant was going to pop out at any moment as Crombie's depiction of Portobello Road tended to remind me of Nottinghill -- the movie. I've stayed in the Bayswater area a number of times as well as other parts of London (my son lives on Wimpole Street) and I find Muslims, Sikhs and other folks from Southern Asia live all over London including the Bayswater/Portobello Road area (and their children ride the public buses). On the other hand, folks from the Caribbean more or less integrated with the British working class some time ago, are much less visible these days.<br />Mise en Scene?? Crombie is not the only American writer to cash in on the world-wide love of \\"cosy\\" UK mysteries, snd she is no better a writer than some of her rivals such as Elizabeth George. Although Crombie has been compared to PD James (an authentic UK author), she is not in James' league. Baroness James knows English society well and has an incredible talent for character development and scene setting-expertise I find very important if I am to care about what happens to the characters in a novel. People without depth and underdeveloped scenes leave me cold. With the advant of television and filmmaking, more than ever before, readers now visualize the action in a book in terms of the setting. Without the appropriate mterial, the action falls flat. James is a master at painting a backdrop, establishing a believable milieu and setting a tone. In James novels, the sense of place becomes as important as what the characters say and do. I can still vividly recall scenes James described in books I read years ago (and not all have been included in the many films based on her books).<br />Too many cooks spoil the stew... According to the \\"spin\\" on her book jacket,  Crombie has  been described as one who writes \\"literary\\"text. I don't think so. I am as familiar with great English literature as the next bibliophile, and Crombie does not produce literary tomes. Great books in any language have intricate AND integrated plots. Crombie's plots in recent books are extremely clumsy.  At one point in this novel, Kincaid comments on how the current investigation is a &quot;real mess&quot;.  My thought on reading this passage was \\"yes, indeedy, this story is a mess.\\"  Crombie usually thanks her \\"Every other Tuesday night writers' group.  Perhaps she should begin to write her own story and wean herself from their \\"help\\". This book reads as if a committee wrote it.<br />Professionalism. Writers have been advised to write about what they know. It seems to me that Crombie like many other younger writers has much to learn about office politics. Gemma James is no Jane Tennison. Screwing your co-worker and then copping a promotion wins you no praise fromfellow workers. Most folks find this sort of behavior threatening, so it should not be surprising that Gemma has a conflict with her male subordinate. Bad enough to deal with one boss. Who needs a boss and co-worker who are `intimate\\"? Even if they are married, which James and Kincaid are not, there is a certain feeling of \\"ganging up\\" for those not \\"in the loop\\".<br />Read the paperback if you must.

Rae BETH is an astrologer, tarot consultant and feminist.  Her book entitled THE WICCAN PATH is one of the best books I've read on how and why one woman became a `solitary witch' as opposed to joining a coven of witches. According to Rae Beth, solitaries are often hedge witches, akin to the little old lady who lived at the edge of the village in the hedge that enclosed the village space. In THE HEDGE WITCH'S WAY, Rae Beth elaborates on concepts raised in her earlier book about solitaries who are also known as `lone spellcasters' or `wildwood mystics'.  Are you a wildwood mystic?  Read Rae Beth's books to find out.<br />Among other topics, in the THE HEDGE WITCH'S WAY Rae Beth asks `Who are you praying to? According to Rae Beth manifestations of the GREAT GODDESS take many forms. She is sacred, numinous, inclusive, and wise love. She is at the center and holds all together. She is synthesis and integration, the ground of all being and within every star, the sun and the moon.  Through the ages, she has had many names -- Mari, Morgan, Aradia.  The role of the GOD is different.  He is the source of change, the trickster and magician and the experimenter on a cosmic scale.  He is the prophet, the innovator and the paradox.<br />Rae Beth has much to say about magic, fairies and shining beings, as well as rituals to honor the higher power, prayers and spells for good fortune, the acquisition of a familiar spirit, and the `steps along the way'.  She explains how one builds an alter, and travels between the `underworld', the `upperworld', and the `middle Earth'. She explains how the GODDESS and GOD take on different forms in the three worlds.<br />This book nicely compliments her earlier work, however, I recommend you read THE WICCAN PATH first so as to gain a better appreciation of her sincere beliefs before you attempt to use some of her magical techniques and approaches.	2004-03-26

What did Paul the author of various letters (epistles) to the Corinthians, Galatians, Hebrews, Ephesians, Romans and other inhabitants of the ancient world really think about Jesus Christ?  Folks who have studied Paul's writings in various church-education programs have been taught that Paul had much to say about the 'law' versus 'faith', but was he writing in a kind of code that only an initiated few (an 'elect') could understand?<br />Using unorthodox(non-canonical) sources such as the writings of  Valintinus, Basilides, Simon, and Carpocrates as well as the orthodox writings of early church \\"leaders\\" like Irenaeus, who preached against 'Gnosicism' Elaine Pagels demonstrates how Paul appears to have written \\"dual\\" passages that can be viewed as supportive of the Gnostic position.  What is the Gnostic position?  According to my reading of Pagels text, Gnosticism seems to have included the belief that God did not become man in the form of Jesus Christ, i.e. he did not take on a material form which was crucified, died, and buried and then arose from the dead. The Gnostics or 'pneumatike physis' have been exposed to a 'pneumatic charisma' (Romans 1:11) that leads them to regard bodily or material things with indifference. As a result they interpret Paul's discussion of the 'resurrection' not as a material event but as a pneumatic or spiritual event.  The idea that God took on a material form and was 'killed' and then resurrected from the dead is absurd according to the Gnostics. They suggest that when Paul spoke of the death of the body and resurrection, he meant the death of the psychic body (physei) and it's replacement with pneumatic or spiritual understanding transmitted through grace (charis). Pagels says Gnostic writers translated I Corinthians 13:13 as about \\"faith (earth), hope(water), love(wind) and gnosis (light)\\"and suggests they believed that only through gnosis does one mature spiritually.<br />Paul says he was spiritually born though the grace of God (charis). As such he is 'raised from the deadness of this life to spiritual life', i.e. \\"the resurrection of the dead is the recognition of the truth spoken by those who have gnosis.\\"<br />Pagels' book is relatively complex, but may prove illuminating for those interested in a different understanding or non-orthodox interpretation of text that is often taken quite literally. In the end, Pagels suggests that the historical theologian cannot discern Paul's intent, be it orthodox or gnostic, although there appears to be a good deal of evidence to support the notion that Paul understood the Gnostic point of view.charis).

INNER SIMPLICITY is a set of 100 suggestions that can improve the quality of your life. Like the parables of old, this little book holds many bits of wisdom that can lead to happiness and contentment. No matter what your life circumstances, St. James words can be applied in some measure.  For example, I am using a suggestion she makes for encouraging yourself in a `good' behavior. Each day I remember to exercise, I stick a shiny little star on my wall calender. The calender looks pretty and I feel good (if it works for children, why not reward your own inner child??). Another suggestion St James makes involves \\"examining the costs of saying no.\\" Along with reducing the need to be \\"in the know\\" it goes a long way toward making life more pleasant.<br />You can use these `readings' as daily guides. I read the book from cover to cover over several weeks, and now refer to various suggestions each day.  Each suggestion is a (small) page or two in length, so you can read it at the start of your day. Frequently the suggestions are interlinked.  For example, figuring out `what you have to teach others' is linked with `learning to forgive'. I like this book so much I am going to read others by St James - especially `Living the Simple Life'.	2004-03-06

Should items of historical importance be made available for study by all scholars despite their world views or political philosophies, or should scholars privileged to study historical artifacts be selected by a committee of \\"recognized experts\\"?  If the latter is so, how do recognized experts become expert, and how is the governing committee that anoints the would-be scholars chosen from amongst these experts?<br />The dirty little secret of academic research is that power struggles over money, influence, and interpretation take place among power brokers with an agenda. Unfortunately, government and religious organizations are not immune from influence peddling and frequently have compelling reasons for attempting to control science and journalism. Even in the United States, scholarly committees and subcommittees have at times become pawns of the state.<br />BBC journalists Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, who wrote HOLY BLOOD HOLY GRAIL,  wrote THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS DECEPTION about 15 years ago. While some of the issues they examined and exposed in their latter book have been more or less resolved, other issues remain. In all likelihood, the book acted as a catalyst affecting the release of vital information about the historical scrolls discovered more than 60 years ago at Qumran (around the time of the discovery of the Nag Hammadi scrolls in Egypt). Baigent and Leigh suggest that while the Nag Hammadi scrolls have been examined, studied, and interpreted by an International host of scholars from differing backgrounds, in contrast, a committee of religious scholars blocked  objective study and interpretation of the Dead Sea scrolls for almost 50 years.<br />The authors disagree with the interpretation offered by the self appointed committee that controlled access to the Dead Sea Scrolls.  In contrast with the committee, Baigent and Leigh contend that the material found at Qumran does not predate, but includes the period when Jesus is supposed to have lived.  Secondly, they suggest Jesus and his brother James the `Righteous' may have been a members of this community, which had close ties with the Jewish Zealots who perished at Masada. Thirdly, the authors suggest the Qumran group was not a hermit male religious order, but was comprised of men, women and children. Fourth, the authors suggest Paul may have been a member of the group for a short while and may turned on it to promote his own brand of religion. Fifth, the authors contend the Nozrei ha brit (keepers of the covenant) or Nozrim (Zealot-Essene-Nazorean) sect sought to uphold the law, not to overturn it (Matthew 5:17-20). The group was diametrically opposed to the Jewish party in league with the Romans.<br />I enjoyed the book immensely because I have long been troubled by some aspects of Jesus reported behavior (overturning the tables of the money changers in the temple) and words (swords, enmity between relatives, etc.) and statements about the law.  The authors have assembled a prodigious amount of information to support their claims (writings of Josephus and other `Romans' as well as archeological material are included).ndly, they suggest Jesus and his brother James the `Righteous' may have been a members of this community, which had close ties with the Jewish Zealots who perished at Masada.

As ususal, Llewellyn's almanac explores a topic with broad appeal - herbs for 2004 - discussed from many perspectives, some very informed some not so informed.  Those with a strong background may find less of interest than those just beginning to grasp the complexities of `herbs' which can actually be almost any plant.  The amazing thing about any plant is that it may be an herb waiting to be discovered or as is more frequently the case a plant that was known in past times for medicinal or other health and beauty related properties.<br />Most of us think of rosemary, thyme, parsley, sage, and lavender as herbs, but dandelions, nettles, nasturtiums and sweet violets also may be classified as herbs owing to their various uses. Furthermore, although cloves, cinnamon, and olive oil are not technically herbs (from a \\"scientific\\" standpoint) at least one author in this compendium lists them as such.<br />The almanac contains these sections - `Growing and Gathering Herbs'; `Culinary Herbs'; `Herbs for Health'; `Herbs for Beauty'; `Herb Crafts' and `Herb History, Myth and Magic'.  Selected essays in each section are useful, although I would recommend one consult a second (Rodale's ILLUSTRATED ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HERBS); third (Penelope Ody's COMPLETE MEDICINAL HERBAL); or fourth (Andrew Chevallier's ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINAL PLANTS) source before using herbs for medicinal purposes.<br />The most interesting section from my perspective can be found in the `Herbs for Health' section where Scott Appell's essay \\"Growing the Medicinal herbs of Latin America\\" appears.  According to the biography in the almanac, Appell is formerly director of education for the Horticultural Society of New York and currently is director for the St. George Village Botanical Garden on St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Appell is also a board member of the American Violet Society, and has a few things to say about that lovely plant.<br />Although these Llewellyn almanacs appear dated (this for 2004) the dated material only fills 20 pages of a book 300+ pages long.

In THE WITCHES' CRAFT, Raven Grimassi, a hereditary Italian witch continues to inform those who care to know about the ways of witches, Wicca, and pagans.  At the time CRAFT was published, Grimassi was directing Elder of the Arician Tradition.  CRAFT describes the resurgence of the `Old Ways' of Witchcraft into the modern world.  Had they completely disappeared?  Grimassi thinks not as he was taught a hereditary path, but whether or not you have access to hereditary material, you can find and use the well worn path of Wicca until you find your own path of heart.<br />For those who might find the notion of Wicca or witchcraft off-putting, Grimassi raises an important point..who determines what is religion?  \\"Mainstream\\" religions with numerous members can claim a secure status no matter how \\"wacky\\" their ideas might seem to the non-religious or members of competing religions.  However, Wicca, the oldest of all religions is viewed by some sceptics as a recent incarnation, a fabrication, or something worse.  Grimassi says no other religion is held to the standards of \\"purity\\" imposed on Wicca. And what is Wicca..nothing less than the religion of our paleolithic fore-parents who were not arrogant know-it-all moderns. Our ancient parents understood that humans must be at-one with the natural world which is a mystical place. They also understood that the path of heart illuminates this truth and provides the individual with the reason for living.<br />Grimassi's description of the differences between the \\"well-worn path\\" taught by various religious traditions (including Wicca) and the journey of the individual as s/he follows the trajectory of her own soul-path agrees with the teaching of Joseph Campbell who wrote and spoke of the \\"hero's journey.\\" Grimassi says you choose a religious tradition to get you started on the 'well worn path', however, to truly progress you must extend yourself and follow the path the hero blazed. This path is frightening as each of us believes a monster awaits us at the end of the inward exploration of our own existence. Campbell suggests and Grimassi agrees that rather than a monster, at the end of the journey the aloneness you experience will be dissolved and you will be one with the world. This at-one-ment can only be reached on the individual soul-path.<br />Although the CRAFT is for intermediate students (parts of it may frighten the novice), I've believe Grimassi's latest book should be included among standard Wicca classics including Starhawk's SPIRAL DANCE and inspirational works by Cunningham, Valiente, and others. Grimassi does not discuss alternative Wiccan traditions in great detail in this book (see Margo Adler's DRAWING DOWN THE MOON - yes, she is the NPR reporter - and Starhawk's book to acquire this detail), however he does share information about his personal variant - `Italian witchcraft' - which he detailed in his earlier book of the same name.

Just what is a Cultural Creative?  Authors Paul Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson conducted a study for the EPA (1998) to ascertain citizen views about the environment. What they discovered was 50 million CC individuals who are changing the world one step at a time. The authors supply a test the reader can use to determine whether they are a `Traditional' (25 percent of the population); a `Modern' (50 percent); or a CC (25 percent).<br />Using their three \\"types\\" to explore cultural values, including attitudes towards the environment, the authors have uncovered a lot of good and bad news.  Not surprisingly perhaps, all three groups think the environment is very important (good) while disagreeing about many other cultural issues including the best way to deal with the environmental mess that is killing life on this planet (bad). The authors suggest that while most folks are aware of the attitudes and opinions of the `Modern' and `Traditional' types because they can be found arguing in newspapers, on tv and in person, the opinions and activities of the Cultural Creative types are more elusive.<br />Ray and Anderson have assembled a huge amount of information and synthesized it into a fairly coherent package. They leave virtually no sociological source untapped as they report on everything from AIDS to Zen. Their book is nicely complemented with survey results and graphs (simple and easy to understand) and plenty of references for further reading. While I don't agree with each and everything these authors say (only 95 percent), I do believe thinking people (especially Moderns..which I used to be) need to read this provocative book.<br />I underlined so many passages and pasted sticky markers on so many pages I don't know where to begin to describe the content, except to say this is not a doom and gloom book that will make you want to swallow rat poison.  This book offers examples of a better way to live.  It offers HOPE for our planet. To put the CC message in a nutshell..if we want life to continue on this planet we must act and act now.<br />You may not agree with all you read, but you will probably find the authors arguments compelling and may discover you are already a Cultural Creative or on the way to becoming one through the process of self-actualization (yes, they include Maslow, Jung, Joseph Campbell, and Wicca and Catholic nuns).ll..if we want life to continue on this planet we must act and act now.<br />You may not agree with all you read, but you will probably find the authors arguments compelling and may discover you are already a Cultural Creative or on the way to becoming one through the process of self-actualization (yes, they include Maslow, Jung, Joseph Campbell, and Wicca and Catholic nuns).	2004-02-12

THE AMERICAN GARDENER is one in a series of historical gardening books edited by Michael Pollin and published by the Modern Library of Gardening.  Although William Cobbett's newly republished book was first printed in 1856, it contains many observations contemporary gardeners will find both salient and wise. AG is divided into several sections: laying out gardens, managing hot beds and green houses (which will be of interest to those living in cooler climates); and propagating and cultivating all sorts of plants. Cobbett includes annotated plant lists covering vegetables, herbs, fruits, and flowers extant in the Northeastern US in the 19th century. In addition to cultivation tips, he includes descriptions of potential plant uses such as eating hops as a side dish or making wine from grapes.<br />Newer gardeners may find Cobbett's book challenging because it mostly lacks illustrations, contemporary  nomenclature and/or Latin terminology. However, Cobbett humanizes plant cultivation and encourages the new gardener with sage advice such as foiling those `vegetable devils' dock and dandelion by eating them as greens.  Although some of Cobbett's  plant references are a bit archaic, such as `Clove' or `Cowslip', a good reference book informs the reader that the first is a type of Dianthus akin to the Carnation (sometimes called \\"Pinks\\") and the second may be what moderns call Pulmonaria.<br />I have find Pollen's gardening series appealing because these `historical' books allow me step back in time and observe how \\"organic\\" gardening and gardeners carried on in earlier days.  Cobett's book is set in 19th century America-the halcyon days before the onslaught of super bugs that gargle with DDT, ravaging diseases, and genetically modified Frankenstein plants brought to you by large agribusinesses that constantly battle with natural processes. William Cobbett understood that real gardeners respect Mother Nature.	2004-01-31

Elizabeth Buchan notes that a very old saying reminds us living well is the best revenge. Once you reach the point you decide the other person is only human and that no matter how much you loved him or her if she or he doesn't love you back, or love you back well enough to do something about it, there's not much you can do. So,  you decide to get on with your own life.  A few years ago the film `Fatal Attraction' offered one alternative for the woman scorned, but most of us don't go that route. Instead, we attempt like Rose of THE REVENGE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN to get over it and get on with it. But it takes time. I had a friend whose wife left him on Saturday. He decided to get over it by going to the beach for several days. He left on a Sunday, thinking by Thursday when he came back home he would be \\"cured\\" of his pain. Of course he wasn't.  It takes time to heal.<br />A self-help book published back in the 1970s around the time I went through a divorce suggested you give yourself two years to heal. Then you might be ready to involve yourself with some one new should you choose. I found it most true. I involved myself with some one six months after I separated from my \\"other\\" and it was a disaster.  Next time I waited more than two years and it worked out much better. My daughter was widowed seven years ago and remarried last summer. Like the character Jamie Lee Curtis plays in `Freaky Friday' I think it will work. The psyche needs time to heal and you are worth the wait.<br />Rose has good sense. She takes time to heal when her twenty-five year-old marriage ends because her husband goes off the tracks at age 51 and falls for a 28 year old woman who also happens to work for Rose!! But younger people grow older, and although the besotted male may not see the \\"warts\\" when he falls for his new \\"girl\\" eventually like the barnacles of old age they show up.  Sometimes when this happens, the old partner looks really good. Sometimes the old partner takes the wandering partner back.  Most often, nothing fixes the old relationship. But the jilted ex has better things to do with his or her life than sit around and dwell on the old ex and his or her new `partner'.  If you are or have been through \\"splits-vil\\" you might want to read this book. It shows you a way to live well without seeking revenge.artner back.

I hate to give any book by P.D.James less than five stars, but as mysteries go THE MURDER ROOM is not one of her better books. She gets four stars from me because even on her worst days James is better than most of her fellow mystery writers.<br />James strength lies in her character development, and as ususal, in THE MURDER ROOM she has done a wonderful job of getting into the heads of the principle players and sharing their &quot;secrets&quot; with the reader. James also has a great talent for setting the stage and if you like being transported to England via armchair you should know that no one does it better--probably why the dramatized versions of her books are so well done.<br />However, plot development has never been James strong suit. She often has difficulty linking the murderer's personality with the motive to kill. Her characters seem like ordinary human beings, but sooner or later one of them does something horrendous which seems all out of character and &quot;overkill&quot; for someone who could probably figure out a better way to get on. Maybe that's the nature of murder--stupid.<br />However, for James, it's almost as though having created a fully rounded character she has difficulty connecting her creation with the act of committing murder. Sometimes she pulls it off, other times not.  When she fails, the end is often frenetic and stretches the imagination beyond the breaking point.<br />I will always read James' tales because I appreciate her philosophical insights acquired over a long life lived in interesting times.<br />I bought the hardcover version of this book, but I am recommending to friends that they buy a used book (if they don't borrow mine), check the book out of the library, or wait for the soft cover. The price is too steep for the contents within.	2004-01-24

However, I did not know I would discover so much of interest about US history.  Baigent and Leigh provide a great amount of information about the origins, experiences and demise of the Knights Templar including their battles in the Holy Land and the persecution and destruction of their order by King Phillip of France. The authors also provide a cogent argument for the involvement of the remnants of the Templar order in the battle of Bannockburn which freed the Scots from England. And, Baigent and Leigh discuss the rise of the Freemasons and their connections to the White-Robed Knights.<br />However, one of the more interesting parts of this book is the story of the founding of the US (shift from British colony to Republic) which took place under the guidance of Freemasons such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. Was the Revolution a Masonic plot?  Baigent thinks not, but  he does point to British officers and their men who were Masons (Howe, Cornwallis, etc) who might not have put their hearts and souls into a fight with fellow American Freemasons. He also notes Freemasons came from all over Europe to assist the colonists-France (Lafayette), Germany (von Steuben), Poland (Pulaski), etc.<br />Baigent points out quite correctly that the ideas of European thinkers such as Locke, Hume, Adam Smith, and the French philosophers are incorporated in the Constitution. He also suggests that most of these thinkers were Freemasons or men who moved in Masonic circles. Masonic notions such as the \\"separation of church and state\\" are at the heart of the Constitution. \\"In God We Trust\\" (found on the one dollar bill) was not the motto of the men who drafted the Constitution. Their motto was \\"Novus Ordo Seclorum\\" (also found on the one dollar bill above the pyramid-a symbol of Freemasonry).  Novus Ordo Seculorum refers to the \\"new secular order\\" the founders thought they were establishing. They recognized the tyranny of religion and wanted it kept arms length from the public arena.

In MAGDALENE'S LOST LEGACY, Margaret Starbird continues her exploration of the message of Mary the companion of Yeshua (Jesus) by examining the gematria of the canonical gospels and other books of the Bible's New Testament.<br />As every statistician knows, the Greek alphabet consists of symbols like \\"delta\\" and \\"pi\\" that also work as numbers. Starbird suggests that using Greek alphanumerics to encode relevant passages, early \\"heretical\\" Christians hid verboten material in otherwise inoffensive text.  Irenaeus, a church father of the 4th century who ordered the destruction of Gnostic material (such as the books found at Nag Hammadi) knew of this practice and forbade it.  However, the \\"heretics\\" did not listen to him, and they hid material about the Magdalene in the New Testament - in the synoptic gospels and the mysterious Book of Revelation.  Starbird says modern computers have provided scholars the means to decode these arcane messages.  (She provides a Greek key you can use to interpret passages in Greek included in the book).<br />Hidden numbers aside, Starbird poses a question asked by other scholars - why do specific numbers appear in the books of the Bible and do they matter.  For example, why were 153 fishes caught in a net (John 21:11) or why were there x number of loaves and fishes?  The Book of Revelations suggests the `beast' is 666.  In gemetric code, 666 = the solar principle.  Starbird suggests the solar principle without a lunar principle leads to a desert. Day without night or Sol alone = \\"raw abusive, power, the power of the tyrant\\" or the male element run amuck. When the male element is combined with the female (lunar or night =1080) they form 1746 the symbolic equivalent of \\"the grain of mustard seed\\" or \\"the kingdom of God within.\\" The marriage of sol and luna or masculine and feminine (1746=union of opposites) is also the gematria for \\"Jerusalem the city of God.\\"<br />This wonderful book continues Starbird's exploration of messages about the Magdalene hidden in plain sight for two millennium.

In THE GODDESS IN THE GOSPELS, Margaret Starbird shares the story behind the story of  `The Woman with the Alabaster Jar'.  In many ways, the personal spiritual journey Starbird experienced and shares with the reader in GODDESS is a more compelling tale than the one she eventually wrote about the Magdalene. GODDESS has much in common with `The Dance of the Dissident Daughter' by Sue Monk Kidd. (Kidd acknowledges Starbird's influence in her book). GODDESS also nicely complements HOLY BLOOD HOLY GRAIL.<br />Like many women born into religious orthodoxy, Starbird struggled for years to live by the rules of conduct the church prescribed for women.  Because she is a person of great depth, intelligence, grace, and spiritual awareness, her attempt to live within the narrow, confined and misogynist tradition of her church led her to the edge of madness. After a very scary brush with insanity, she accepted the Grail-the path of enlightenment.<br />Starbird concludes that women have long been treated shamefully by orthodox Christianity - especially the Roman Catholic Church. She suggests the RCC abandoned the true message of Jesus when it distorted the memory of the Magdalene as it institutionalized in the 4th century. In recent years, the RCC has made a small effort to ameliorate its decidedly misogynist practices, but these efforts are inadequate and come too late for millions of women.  Starbird suggests that if the RCC does not make drastic changes soon it is doomed. It simply will not do for the church to treat women as anything less than co-equal with men. Just as the Magdalene was co-equal with Jesus, all women are co-equal with all men. Furthermore, the church needs to change its attitude toward birth control, divorce, married priests, and women priests, etc.  In short, its time for the church to undergo a Reformation.	2004-01-01

If you read Margaret Starbird's book THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR you won't find very much new material in THE TAROT TRUMPS AND THE HOLY GRAIL. TT is a synopsis of the Tarot material found in her earlier book and not nearly as good because she does not link the Tarot cards to paper watermarks,  fairy tales, and other material as she did in her earlier book.<br />Starbird suggests the Tarot cards were used as an `Ars memoria' or a technique for creating mental images that allow one to store and recall information. Thus used, the cards would have proved invaluable for relaying `heretical' information in a sub rosa fashion in a climate where \\"thinking outside the box\\" got one burned at the stake. The notion the Tarot cards were used as memory devices for transmitting verboten information is not new. For example, Cynthia Giles makes a similar point regarding a possible hidden link between Gnostic material and the Tarot cards in her book THE TAROT published in 1991.<br />However, Starbird specifically links the Tarot cards with the notion that Mary Magdalen was the \\"holy grail\\" who carried Jesus' child (as well as the founder of the \\"church of love\\").  Furthermore, she suggests the Tarot cards can only be seen as an `Ars memoria' for the Grail story and have nothing to do with gypsies, Egypt, or India.<br />Starbird's argument for the exclusivity of the Grail-Tarot connection hinges on the date of the first appearance of the so-called Charles VI or Gringonneur deck which she links to the Grail story. Starbird suggests that if the Charles VI deck dates from the end of the 14th century it had to have been created before the arrival of the gypsies who are thought to have arrived in Europe in the 15th century. (Cynthia Giles suggests the Charles VI deck first surfaced at the end of the 15th century which means they &quot;arrived&quot; about the same time as the gypsies. Joseph Campbell suggests the earliest date of the cards as 1392 CE. However, Campbell also suggests the Tarot cards carry archetypical symbols that can be linked to many `religious' systems and/or works of art).<br />The clothing of the figures in several of the Charles VI cards such as \\"The Lovers\\" became popular at the end of the 15th century which would support Giles dating of the deck, but Starbird suggests the Charles VI cards might have been \\"updated\\" with \\"modern\\" clothing in a later edition.<br />I enjoyed reading Starbird's suppositions and comparing them with similar proposals by other Tarot writers.

Reginald Arkell's lovely book OLD HERBACEOUS is unusual as it is a novel about gardening with a gardener protagonist. Michael Pollen and company have added this book to their ever expanding collection of gardening gems-The Modern Library Garden Series. OH was first published in 1950.<br />At the opening of the book, Pinnegar the protagonist has retired and is living in a cottage on the estate where he gardened for over 60 years. He reflects on how he began his gardening career when Mrs Charteris instructed her head gardener, a Mr. Addis, to hire him after he won a wild flower arrangment contest she judged. Sixty years later, Pinnegar has replaced Addis and acquired his nickname `Old Herbaceous' from the younger gardeners who view  him as a relic of a bygone era.<br />The book provides a different perspective on the \\"new\\" gardens promoted by the garden designers and owners such as Jeckell, Bowles, and Robinson who became prominent at the end of the 19th century and  in the early 20th century.  In their books and correspondence, these individuals often write \\"I did this\\" and \\"I did that\\" but in reality they mostly instructed head gardeners who supervised a crew of under gardeners and carried out their instructions. Frequently, these designers and their gardeners were at odds with each other. As anyone who has ever gardened knows, to really understand gardening you must get your hands dirty.  Learning to garden is an acquired skill gained via trial and error and cannot be learned by observation alone.<br />Furthermore, the \\"new\\" gardens designed by Jeckell, Bowles and others which superceded \\"bedding out\\" (the hallmark of Victoria's reign) and formal 19th century gardens drew their inspiration from the cottage gardens of the working class. Cottage gardens consisted of a mix of herbs and perennials growing informally side by side.  Sometimes, the `new' gardens incorporated plants from exotic locales. The tender nature of these plants led to the invention and promotion of glass houses, cold frames, and bell jars. In OLD HERBACEOUS, Pinnegar acquires Ipomoea (morning glory) seeds and grows them in the main green house to please his mistress.<br />The book covers a period from the end of Victoria's reign until just after WWII. While Arkell has a good deal to say about the business of gardening on a large estate, his book is also a study of the relationship between a family retainer his overseer.  Pinnegar presents the workers view, or the view Arkin, himself a member of the middle class, believed a man like Pinnegar would hold.

THE TEMPLARS by Piers Paul Read provides an excellent condensed version of the Templar story-how they evolved from a group charged with protecting Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land into a very powerful order that was eventually crushed by Philip the Fair (complexion, not ethics) of France. Read covers the highlights of the Crusader monks' tale including: 1) the story of Richard the Lion Hearted who rode with them and was so admired by his rival the Kurdish leader Saladin that when his horse was killed during a battle Saladin sent him two more horses; 2) Frederick II who formed friendships with the Muslims Rome condemned; and St Louis went on Crusade with his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine at his side (the wife of Henry II after Louis divorced her, and mother of Richard I). Eleanor seems to have been very `naughty' with the knights in Outremer.<br />Read is a fiction writer whose works include the book ALIVE.  Although THE TEMPLARS is not an academic wor, Read provides competent footnotes and a good bibliography, and he has condensed an enormous amount of academic material and make it accessible to the lay reader. Read's perspective is sympathetic to the Templars, but I do not think he has presented a biased tale. Most historians agree the Templars were unjustly treated by Philip the Fair and Clement V. Many people also agree the Christians had a right to fight a `just war' and take back by force land that had been Christian for over a half a millennium before it fell to Islam (think of the Allies retaking France in WWII).<br />Using both Islamic and Christian sources, Read shows the Muslim `enemy' was composed of many different groups (Turk, Kurd, Mameluke, Mongol, etc.) who fought with each other for control of `Outremer' as much as they fought their common enemy the Christians.  Eventually, however, because of the internecine struggles of the Christian factions, the Muslims successfully discharged the Christians from the Holy Land. The really tragic aspect of the Crusader tale is that Christians inflicted more damage on each other (Cathars, Byzantines, Hungarians, etc.) than their enemy.  Philip the Fair's treatment of the Templars was the most despicable act of all.usader tale is that Christians inflicted more damage on each other (Cathars, Byzantines, Hungarians, etc.) than their enemy.

Karen Ralls has compiled a good study of the Templar Knights. Her book is divided into three sections: 1) recalling the Templar History; 2) addressing the various `non-academic' tales in circulation about the Templars and their connection to among other things, the Holy Grail, and 3) an overview of Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland in which she examines the history of the chapel and it's connections to the Templars and the Holy Grail. Ralls holds the equivalent of a Ph.D. and is an Oxford based medieval historian and Celtic scholar. She was the Deputy Curator of the Rosslyn Chapel museum exhibition.<br />Readers of the DA VINCI CODE will recognize the name Rosslyn (as will those living in Arlington VA which has it's own Rosslyn and is part of the original `square' created for the District of Columbia designed by Masons of old including George Washington). Rosslyn Chapel has an unique connection to the Rose Line in England and has been described as an architectural gem of medieval Scotland. Rosslyn was established by the St. Clair family who are said to have connections to the Holy Grail. The foundation stone of Rosslyn was laid on St. Matthews Day in 1446 C.E.. The chapel's orientation is east-west following the sun's ray as it fell that day-the equinox. The Chapel was damaged during the English Civil War by Cromwell's men who used the structure to stable their horses. However, it was restored by the St Clair family and currently serves as a Scottish-Episcopal church.  If you plan to visit Scotland, especially Edinburgh, get this book.	2003-12-25

HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL appears to be the basis of much of the information found in THE DA VINCI CODE, however in my opinion, the book by Baigent, et al is BETTER. Working on a BBC documentary that explored the topic of \\"The Grail\\", Baignent and his coauthors collected an enormous amount of information which supports the notion that Jesus married Mary Magdalen and fathered a child who went on to become the ancestor of a special bloodline in Europe. Many of the assertions in this book are supported by academic work.  Many academic books, articles, etc, written after HBHG was published indicate there is substance to some suppositions not addressed in earlier research.<br />Baignent is mostly correct when he asserts that academics are mostly analytic and what is needed from time to time is synthesis, but a number of historians - Braudel, Schama, and Norwich to name a few, have presented enormous amounts of academic material in various synthetic studies. When these historians synthesize, they rely on a disciplined approach that reflects training in how to present an \\"unbiased\\" study. Journalists like Baignent are generally looking for something \\"newsworthy\\" and different (not reported or under-reported). In addition, they rely on secondary material of varying quality (from the perspective of the academic). On the other hand, the academic working within restricted guidelines can be viewed as the victim of a kind of censorship.<br />One further note - Every person (particularly those living in America and Europe) has a possible 1 million ancestors over a 400 year period. (2 to the 20th  power - two parents, four grandparents, eight great grandparents, etc.; assumes mean length of a generation = 20 years). Intermarriage among the members of a village would narrow this number for individuals, but powerful males (like knights with \\"first night\\" rights) have always had access to women from the lower classes. An academic specializing in historical demography once calculated that everyone alive in Europe in the 14th Century (following the Black plague) was related to Charlemagne who had lived about 400 years earlier. Given these \\"odds\\" the chances that the bloodline of Jesus, if it existed, remaining within a few families is fantasy, especially given the forced \\"marriages\\" of noble women from the Cathar areas of France.at everyone alive in Europe in the 14th Century (following the Black plague) was related to Charlemagne who had lived about 400 years earlier.

In her beautiful book THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR Margaret Starbird lays out a compelling case for seeing Mary Magdalen as the `lost bride' of Jesus. Whether you believe the Jesus story was a historical event or is a myth, if you have an interest in the Grail and/or symbolism, you will want to read this book.<br />Apparently, many Europeans, especially in France (Provence) believe(d) the Magdalen escaped Jerusalem after her husband Jesus was executed. Eventually, she traveled to what is today Marseilles, where every year, the local people celebrate her arrival on the Magdalen's feast day. The `fathers' of orthodox Christianity were so appalled by the notion that Jesus might have had sex and produced a child let alone married the Magdalen who some how or another became linked with prostitution, that beginning in the 4th Century the church attempted to squelch the \\"heresy\\".  By the Middle Ages, the church had instituted the Inquisition.<br />However, the harder the Inquisitors pressed \\"heretics\\" like the Cathars, the more clever they became at disguising their truth. Using European fairy tales, water marks on paper printed during the Middle Ages (and frequently  found in bibles!!), and paintings of the Masters like Fra Angelico, Starbird shows how the message of the heretics was hidden in plain sight. She suggests that even the Tarot cards which appeared in Italy just after the \\"last\\" Cathar was hunted down in Spain, may have been a condensed heretical catechism.<br />Ever wonder why some of Botticelli's `Madonnas' are dressed in red when the Roman church instructed artists to depict the Madonna in blue and white? Did you know a branch of the US Army wears the insignia of the Magdalen on it's uniform, and celebrates a dance ball every year on the feast day of saint whose likeness to the Magdalen is uncanny?  Do you know why the `Little Mermaid' is named Ariel, and Snow White \\"died\\" from a poison apple (went to sleep)? Did you know Cinderella may be related to the `Black Madonnas' of Europe including one venerated by Pope John Paul?<br />Starbird says she set out several years ago to refute the \\"heresy\\" she discovered in HOLY BLOOD HOLY GRAIL by Baignent, et al. and discovered not only were these authors onto something there was a whole lot more to share.

Peter Bernhardt is a professor of biology associated with both the St. Louis University and the Missouri Botanical Garden of St. Louis. Although named for America's favorite flower, THE ROSE'S KISS is not dedicated exclusively to the rose.  Bernhardt discusses roses throughout the book-particularly the Dog Rose which may be the grandmother of all time-and every section is headed by an epigram saluting the rose, but Bernhardt's focus is the evolution of angiosperms (flowers)-how they came into existence, how they outfoxed the gymnosperms by making themselves irresistible to pollinators, and how today they are in their glory as humans have fallen for their charms.<br />Hard core gardeners will love this book. Reading Bernhardt you can learn about petals, sepals, carpels and stamens and the fine art of setting seed. The book is loaded with anatomically correct illustrations of flowers and flower parts as well as pollinators and pollinator parts.  Did you know, for example, that those large and beautiful colored \\"petals\\" on your wind flowers (Anemones, Clematis, Hepatica) are really sepals and not petals at all? The next time your Clematis vine produces flowers, observe the green sepals turn white or purple or pink. Other plants like the rose produce sepals that curl back and reveal true petals that open into colorful flowers.<br />Anyone who has gardened for a while notices that bees and butterflies seem to prefer one kind of flower over another, and that some plants produce a sweet scent while others are stinky, and some produce exorbitant amounts of pollen while others seem to produce none, and some flowers produce gobs of nectar while others appear dry. Those who have grown annuals, biennials, and perennials might wonder why some plants last one year, some two, and others go on for a time. Others might wonder why some plants have \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" versions while other plants seem to be self reliant when it comes to setting fruit. Bernhardt addresses these any many other issues concerning flowering plants.<br />Bernhardt says we live on a planet pollinated primarily by bees. Although humans and other animals may enjoy the honey certain kinds of bees produce, flowers depend on many different kinds of bees to set fruit. The continued existence of bees and other pollinators is dependent on environmentally sound human behavior.ny other issues concerning flowering plants. <br />Bernhardt says we live on a planet pollinated primarily by bees.

Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince-authors of TURIN SHROUD-have arrived at some unorthodox conclusions in THE TEMPLAR REVELATION. The authors say that TR grew out of research on the Turin Shroud.  Like their prior book, TR is based on a review and synthesis of information from a wide array of mostly secondary sources. In addition to a well footnoted text, the authors include a bibliography  as well as two sections of photographs.<br />Picknett and Prince suggest that what really happened in the first century C.E. regarding Christianity has been obscured over the past two millennium by various political forces including the Roman Catholic Church. Furthermore, they say they have uncovered what may be the \\"true\\" and \\"shocking\\" story of John the Baptist. And, they suggest the Templars may have acquired this very same information when they visited Jerusalem during the Crusades.<br />As part of their effort, the authors reviewed material based on translations of the Nag Hammadi scrolls, the Talmud, the Bible, and various other religious texts. Their search led them to discover many interesting details and a not a few inconsistencies. For example, regarding the first, they note the opening of the Lord's Prayer found in the New Testament as well as other material in the gospels may have been taken from Egyptian religious texts.<br />I found the author's discussion of the interplay among the various religious sects and beliefs in the Levant during the first century C.E. illuminating-and the outcome of events that took place in those times are still with us. For example, Picknett and Prince suggest the Mandaeans of southern Iraq (known as Marsh Arabs today) appear to believe in an Egyptian mystery-based religion John the Baptist may have preached. The Mandaeans refer to their faith as Johannine Christianity, but Picknett and Prince suggest the Mandaean faith is not Christian. They also suggest the Mandaeans may have shared their faith with the Templars who claimed John the Baptist as their patron. Furthermore, these beliefs may have been handed on to the Masonic order when the Templars were disbanded.<br />While most of the assertions of these authors appear to be based on solid research (i.e., Christianity was probably influenced by the Egyptian mystery religions), some of their suppositions are a bit tenuous (possible but may not be probable). Although the book purports to share arcane Templar knowledge, I don't think the link between the Templars and the Egyptian mystery religions has been established conclusively.

The people of the Caribbean generally fall into several broad groups, those who speak Spanish, those who speak French, and those who speak English.  The Spanish speakers are generally Cuban, Dominican, and Puerto Rican. The French speakers are predominantly Haitian. The English-speaking people of the Caribbean range from Jamaicans to Guyanese. When they migrate from the islands, members of the Spanish and French-speaking groups tend to go to the United States or Canada.  English speakers tend to migrate to the States or England.  Bourne's book examines the history of the migration from islands to England.<br />Goulbourne suggests that although English-speaking immigrants from the Caribbean are a diverse lot, from the perspective of their host country they are a relatively homogeneous group with one foot in England and the other in the Caribbean. Given the circumstance of living in a sometimes less than welcoming place that views them as outsiders, migrants from the Caribbean have looked to each other and discovered commonalities. Much of Goulbourne's book discusses the ways in which the Caribbean migrant community in England has formed it's identity over the past 50 years and how this identity differs from that of people in the host country and the Caribbean.<br />A key attribute of the Caribbean emigree identity is geographic and cultural flexibility. Goulbourne suggests Caribbean emigres and their children have achieved equality before the law in their new home but they still find themselves limited to identifiable spheres of English society.  Unlike many other immigrant groups, the people of the Caribbean have mostly integrated into the working class of England.<br />This book is a good place to begin if you are interested in learning more about the changing face of England, or comparing Caribbean migrant outcomes in England and other places such as the States.	2003-11-27

In THE GNOSTIC GOSPELS, Elaine Pagels writes that in the second century C.E., Christians who followed the solitary path they believed Jesus advocated-of self discovery in the search for the divine-lost their struggle with orthodox Christians who interpreted Jesus' message differently. But for the discovery of their writings at Nag Hammadi in 1945, their experience would have been lost forever. Pagels suggests the orthodox church was so powerful that if these gospels had been discovered at any time earlier, they probably would have been destroyed as heretical material. Pagels includes the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant churches in her definition of orthodox Christianity (any group that holds the four gospels of the new testament of the bible as doctine).<br />Unlike Gnosticism (which refers to the individual search for the knowledge of god within), orthodox Christianity was organized and external. Key aspects of orthodox Christianity included a hierarchical structure (priests, bishops and the pope); a belief in male supremacy; and doctrinal conformity (belief that god became man, died and was resurrected from the dead, i.e., the message of the four gospels of the new testament of the bible).<br />The psychological reality is that most people are afraid of the unknown and prefer to have direction in spiritual matters so the orthodox approach had great appeal for the masses. However, in spite of the dominance of orthodoxy, over the course of the twenty centuries or so since Jesus lived and died, some individuals such as Blake, Dostoevsky, and saints like Teresa and Francis probably experienced something akin to the Gnostic path. Pagels says Dostoevsky in his book the Brothers Karamazov \\"attributes to Ivan a vision of Christ rejected by the church, the Christ who `desired man's free love that he should follow Thee freely' choosing the truth of one's own conscience over material well-being, social approval, and religious certainty\\" - or as the Gnostic gospels put it \\"denouncing the church for seducing people away from the `truth of their freedom'.\\"<br />I enjoyed this powerful book and highly recommend it to anyone taking the road less traveled.gospels put it \\"denouncing the church for seducing people away from the `truth of their freedom'.\\" <br />I enjoyed this powerful book and highly recommend it to anyone taking the road less traveled.	2003-11-22

Dan Brown's book includes a good deal of information about a world that has been hidden in plain sight for a very long time. To a greater or lesser extent depending on the denomination, Christian religious practices include many pagan rites and rituals. The most obvious center on pagan holidays such as Samhain (Halloween = hallowed eve of All Saints Day) or the example in Brown's book that involves the rites of spring.  Those with art history and/or comparative religion backgrounds will be familiar with most of the `occult' information Brown shares (if you can find it in books I guess it isn't too well hidden).<br />However, it is important to keep in mind that Brown's tale is a work of fiction, and as such, the comments and thoughts of the protagonist (Robert) and other characters may or may not be accurate.  For example, the purported millions of people burned at the stake for \\"witchcraft\\" is exaggerated as are the assertions that they were all women and the Roman Catholic church was responsible for all the deaths. Research conducted in the 1990s shows: 1) The numbers of \\"witches\\" burned at the stake was much lower than previously thought; 2) Many of those executed for \\"witchcraft\\" met their fate in Germany, Denmark, and Scotland (nominally Protestant countries at the time of the witch burnings); and most of those executed were not killed by church or secular authorities, but by apparently hysterical illiterate villagers who were both Catholic and Protestant (i.e. Salem in the New World). Perhaps as a result, Italy-a nominally Catholic country-is purported to be the home of the \\"evil eye\\" and many modern witches. (Raven Grimassi, a hereditary Italian witch, has written extensively on this topic).<br />Fiction versus non-fiction aside, my one irritation with Brown's storytelling is that he pulls his punches in the denouement-probably because the editors wanted to increase book sales.  I can't say more without giving away the plot-but this book is not THE NAME OF THE ROSE.<br />While I admit to reading the book non-stop, I wasn't \\"scared\\" after the first few pages. I read on because I found Brown's  weaving of occult information, art history, pagan lore, technology, Templars, Masons, and Paris fascinating. I have a personal interest in the machinations of Rome and the Knights Templar. My grandfather was a very high ranking Mason (as have been most of the male members of my mother's family) and my grandmother was a member of the Eastern Star (as have been most of the female members of my mother's family).  On the other hand, I was raised Roman Catholic because my father was RC (and a Knight of Columbus). To say I absorbed a good deal of conflicting information during my growing up years is an understatement. I could really identify with Sophia.THE ROSE.  <br />While I admit to reading the book non-stop, I wasn't \\"scared\\" after the first few pages.

In THE DANCE OF THE DISSIDENT DAUGHTER, Sue Monk Kidd tells of her journey from mainstream Christian to devotee of the Sacred Feminine. You may recognize Kidd's name. She is now writing fiction.  She was forced to give up many things during the six years covered in her book including a successful career as an Christian inspirational writer, but she also discovered there really is life beyond the one you lead. I won't tell you how things turned out with her Southern Baptist husband - she says that's `his story'.<br />Kidd certainly is a knowledgeable person who seems to have read many of the key books associated with the Sacred Feminine. One other reviewer described her as `almost Wicca' but I don't think that is not quite accurate, and I don't know that Kidd would agree. I can imagine some members of Wicca would disagree with that interpretation. (See DRAWING DOWN THE MOON and THE SPIRAL DANCE for an overview thinking on Wicca.)  If Kidd is a member of Wicca, she hadn't come out of the broom closet as of the writing of this book.<br />Many of us who grew up in the Christian tradition have found the going tough as we became older. Some people can remember where they were the day JFK was killed in Dallas.  I can too, but I can also remember exactly where I was when the pope issued `Humanae Vitae' (sp).  That encyclical upheld traditional RC thinking on birth control.  As one who had been pregnant six times in four years using the \\"approved\\" church method of \\"rhythm\\" (we had a lot of rhythm and no control as the saying goes) that encyclical was the last straw.  Many of us have a moment of crises when we make a decision to stay with the religion of our birth or go on to another path. I chose the latter.<br />Reading Kidd's book I had a sense of recognition. I found myself laughing a crying along with Kidd.  She found a new path, a better path for her. I hope when she is in her sixties (which I am) she will revisit the topic.  I'd like to know where else she's been.	2003-11-15

Thomas Christopher, a garden writer with a great deal of experience went looking for wild roses.  His trip took him all over the United States from Connecticut to Texas to California to the American South.  He discovered a unique fellowship of individuals who over the years have grown and thus preserved what are known as `old roses'.<br />I happen to grow Blanc Double de Courbet in my own garden, so was a little annoyed to read that one of Mr. Christopher's interviewees (Mike Lowe of Nashua NH) did not particularly like this particular Rugosa rose.  I agree the blossoms are not very tidy as they wither on the plant, but cut a few of these roses in full bloom and bring them in the house and you won't care about the faded blossoms (which are more scented than some of the modern hybrids in full bloom).  I like to place a vase of these white roses next to my reading chair. The scent is so fabulous that from time to time I become aware of it no matter how engrossing the book.<br />Christopher interviews folks in California who live in the old gold mine areas where everything is in shambles except the roses growing madly in the abandoned gardens. He interviews elderly Black women who have grown old roses abandoned by their employers who took up with the new hybrids.  The true identity of the roses is often unknown (or was not known before modern genetics) and thus the roses have acquired the names of the persons who `saved' them.  For example, one rose named `Miss Mary Minor' was later identified as `Souvenir de la Malmaison'.<br />Malmaison, as anyone who grows roses knows was the garden of Josephine Bonaparte.  All garden writers who tell the tale like to remind readers that even the British during their battles with Napoleon accommodated Malmaison.  Josephine was able to maintain her garden and stay in contact with British Rosarians in spite of the sea battles that raged around her.<br />Which leads to the decision of the United States to name the rose as the national flower (the rose is the national flower of England not France). Some of us are old enough to remember Senator Dirksen lauding the marigold and nominating it for the honor of national flower. Chistopher reminds the reader that like Benjamin Franklin and the turkey, Dirksen was doomed to fail.  In the end, the US congress chose the rose.

In THE ORIGIN OF SATAN, Elaine Pagels says that the idea of Satan evolved from \\"an opposing angel\\" in Jewish writing such as the book of Lot (Old Testament) to the ultimate source of evil in the Christian gospels (New Testament).  Pagels suggests that Christians associated three distinct sets of `others' with evil (or demonized them) as a way of rallying an opposite force and strengthening group solidarity.<br />The original `others' the Christians demonized were `other' Jews (Jesus and his early followers including Saint Paul were Jewish).  At the time of Jesus, the Pharisees were the main Jewish power in Judea. However, Rome was the supreme ruler of Judea which it occupied as a defeated province. The Pharisees tended to be a \\"peace at any price\\" camp associated with Herod the nominal Jewish king. Other groups of dissenting Jews included the Essenes, who are believed to be the source of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Many scholars including Pagels argue that Jesus, although not a member of a dissenting Jewish party such as the Essenes, was probably seen as a problem by the Pharisees because the Romans probably viewed him as a seditionist after he wrecked the Temple in Jerusalem.<br />Pagels suggests that although the four gospels depict the Roman Governor Pilate as a weak man who gave in to the wishes of the Sanhedrin (the council or court of the Pharisees) regarding the execution of Jesus, contemporary sources including Roman writers describe Pilate as a cruel ruler who summarily executed anyone he suspected of sedition. Furthermore, crucifixion was a Roman form of punishment. Pagels suggests the gospels may have palliated Pilate's involvement in Jesus' death for political reasons.  During the period when the gospels were written, it was dangerous to criticize Rome. Besides, mainstream Jews had refused to accept Jesus as the Messiah, so the Christians had no incentive to downplay the role of the Pharisees and every reason to demonize them.<br />The second `other' group the Christians demonized were the Pagans whose ideas of divinity, gods, and goddesses differed from both the Jewish tradition and the new Christian position.  The third `other' group consisted of heretics who chose a differing interpretation of Jesus' message - as evident in the scrolls from Nag Hammadi. (Pagels covers the pagans who existed at the time the books of the New Testament were written - not later groups or individuals. She also limits her discussion of heresy to those groups reflected in the Nag Hammagi scrolls.)<br />I particularly liked this book because I have always found the idea of Satan wrongheaded.  How can a God who is both omniscient and omnipotent co-exist in a world with an `other' who is the root of all evil, i.e., the devil. God must be his source (as Carl Jung suggested to Rome's chagrin). Oh I believe evil is real.  One only has to reflect on Pogroms and the Holocaust to be reminded of it's existence. However, evil originates in the hearts and minds of human beings. I have long been troubled by the use of Jews, Pagans, dissenting Christians, and others as Christian scapegoats. Pagels suggests the true message of Jesus is about reconciliation which is divine, not seeing fellow human beings as the `other.'up the Christians demonized were the Pagans whose ideas of divinity, gods, and goddesses differed from both the Jewish tradition and the new Christian position.

POTATOES NOT PROZAC is a great book as far as I am concerned because it nicely compliments THE INSULIN RESISTANCE DIET that I have been following for more than a year. DesMaisons is an expert in addiction nutrition, and she has much to say about sugar. Her book provides a good deal of `technical' information about how sugar interacts with bodily functions and produces unwanted feelings- both physical and emotional. You may get a high from a sugar \\"hit\\" but it's sure to be followed by a letdown. In addition, over the long haul, you are likely to find your body is not behaving well.  DesMaisons uses the analogy of the fire fighter who is called out night after night and is finally so exhausted he cannot perform.<br />I particularly like the \\"Impact\\" indexes DesMaisons has developed for white, brown, and green foods. She ranks cereals (Cheerios may not be so bad after all), fruits (forget raisons), and vegetables (can you really become addicted to carrots?). These lists are not exhaustive - for example I missed grapefruit and okra, but they are a beginning guide.<br />One shortcoming of the book is the dearth of examples regarding appropriate food combinations. She does say to avoid combining protein (dairy, such as a nice glass of milk) with that baked potato you are supposed to eat before bed.  I can't eat a baked potato without milk (besides it produces perfect protein). Her point though, is that to produce serotonin in the brain, you need to ingest something with complex carbohydrates (sugar) that will work on the protein you ate earlier in the evening. She offers substitutes for the potato such as oatmeal which will go down nicely with butter and a dash of brown sugar.<br />DesMaisons offers a seven-step plan that includes eating three meals a day.  She admits further on in her book that she knows eating three meals a day is impossible for some people. It sure is for me. I eat breakfast at my desk at 6:30 a.m. (yogurt and fruit) and I don't eat lunch until 1:30 p.m.  I need that mid-morning snack of celery and peanut butter.

Elaine Pagels has written a book I can understand and identify with spiritually.  It's been a while since I found anything written about Christianity that did not send me into spasms. I was raised Christian (I even taught church school for a number of years) but over time I became alienated from Christian theology.  I simply could not and can not accept some of the \\"core\\" traditional teachings.  I want to accept these \\"givens\\" - mind you it would have made my life easier - but I cannot.  I am driven or compelled by some inner voice that challenges me continuously. It is heartening to know that others, particularly those who buried the \\"gnostic\\" gospels near Nag Hammadi Egypt 1700 years ago felt similarly.<br />In BEYOND BELIEF - THE SECRET GOSPEL OF THOMAS Pagels examines the conflicting gospels of John and Thomas.  The gospel of John has been used to support the notion that Jesus was exclusively divine and that the only way to god is via his representative on earth. John is the source of the `I and a Thou' relationship with God. Thomas, on the other hand, suggested that Jesus was divine, but this divinity was a divinity accessible to all, i.e. could be found in every human. Like the eastern guru, Thomas suggests that Jesus message is that the kingdom of God is within.  Seek and you shall find.<br />A particularly revealing section Pagels translates from the `Secret Book' suggests God sent Adam \\" `a `helper' - luminous epinoia [`creative' or `inventive' consciousness] which comes out of him, who is called Life [Eve]; and she `helps' the whole creation, by working with him and by restoring him to his full being, and by teaching him about the descent of his kind, and by showing the way to ascend, the way he came down.'  Thus Eve symbolizes the gift of spiritual understanding, which enables us to reflect-however imperfectly-upon divine reality.&quot;<br />I like that very much. Sounds like the God(ess) of My Understanding.	2003-11-06

In THE SUGAR ADDICT'S TOTAL RECOVERY, Kathleen DesMaisons elaborates on material found in her earlier book POTATOES NOT PROZAC.  DesMaisons is an expert on addictive nutrition. Many people who eat sugar impulsively may have an addiction problem. Sugar can be found in everything from alcohol to apples.  DesMaisons earlier book discussed the science underlying her claim that the serotonin level in the brain is a major factor in depression and other disfunctional behavior. In this book, she reinforces her earlier findings and elaborates further.  Her approach will appeal to those familiar with 12-step recovery programs. Additional information in SATR includes: 1)  a Q&amp;A where DesMaisons futher elaborates on eating potatoes (why it is a good idea before bedtime); 2) a small section of recipes; and, 3) an extended list of covert sugars.<br />DesMaisons says it's not just overt sugars that can be a problem. Covert sugars have been added to most processed foods and can be a major issue.  Did you know that eating low-fat ice cream may be worse than eating regular ice cream?  The lo-fat kind relies on sugar to give you the smooth texture provided by fat in the cream kind. I have found DesMaisons books very helpful because I have been following the INSULIN RESISTANCE DIET advocated by Hart and Grossman, and DesMaisons books nicely complement their work.  Getting sugar consumption under control and lowering my insulin resistance has been a major factor in my improved health. I am 61,  just had my physical and my sugar is perfect (from diet and exercise alone)-and I am related to dozens of diabetics.	2003-11-06

One book says holly berries are unsafe while another says they are not.  While I am not about to feed my parrots Ilex in any form, I have noted that the Mockingbirds and others fight over the holly berries out back, and the pokeberry bushes across the street are stripped clean (and their offspring come up in my yard).  Petra Burgmann subscribes to idea that holly plants are unsafe and that birds will eat unsafe things. (How do they survive in the wild?).<br />I've lived with companion birds for about nine months, and thankfully not killed any of them in spite of the fact Burgman and other authors I've read offer conflicting advice.  I guess the rule of thumb is if in doubt, don't do it.  I thought I was doing a pretty good job of balancing the nutritional needs of my birds, but on reading Burgmann's book I find there is more I can do. The baby Senegal and Lutino Cockatiel parrots who live with me seem to be more willing to try a variety of foods than do the pair of five-year old Cockatiels I obtained from the shelter last January who are interested in little other than seed.  (Burgmann has much to say about seed!)<br />Following Burgman's advice, I am persisting in morning and afternoon offerings of non-seed items to the reluctant duo.  This morning, the female \\"shelter\\" Cockatiel (Keena) actually dragged a piece of broccoli from her food dish and pecked at it a few times.  This is progress as she generally shuns anything that smacks of plant life with the exception of Cilantro. According to Burgman, she and the other parrots need to eat broccoli or something with Vitamin A on a regular basis.<br />Burgman points out that birds do not have a very well developed sense of smell, so yesterday I tried a Jalape&ntilde;o pepper with Bertie the Senegal, and he attacked it madly. Of course the dog was shocked when he tossed the leftovers on the floor for her.  This morning, the crew had Pomegranate seeds in honor of Persephone who disappears at this time of the year.  Burgmann says birds like texture in their food, so the Pomegranate seeds are a good bet though she does not list them as a nutritious item in her food list. (At least they don't appear on the toxic list!)<br />Burgman's book includes a somewhat technical discussion of nutrition and bird physiology, but she writes in a clear and concise style that makes it relatively painless to read.  I took the book to work and read it while I ate my own lunch. She explains bird food processing relative to human food processing so I could imagine what was happening to my lunch.  I had no idea the liver performed so many critical tasks.<br />Although she provides a good bit of text about bird droppings, I found no pictures.

Although Wright included an entry for every day of the year plus a longer piece for each of the first 11 months, I read about ten pages a night and thus finished it in about a month. Wright was the editor-in-chief of House and Garden for thirty four years. He and his wife were upscale, maintaining homes in New York City and Connecticut. He had a hired gardener to help him mind his acreage and apparently room for pigs and chickens.<br />Wright says he has not written a \\"how-to\\" gardening book.  However, he offers mostly useful garden suggestions at the end of each entry (for those in growing zone 5 or 6 in Connecticut), as well as a few bits of wisdom. Wright also wrote a few comments some will find offensive. Vegetarians will find his interaction with two pigs named WEE-WEE and FANNIE a bit painful. (He raised and slaughtered them during the course of the year.)  African Americans may object to either one or both of two entries in the latter part of the book. (i.e., Wright and his wife collected antiques and among other items he was searching for a \\"yard-boy.\\")<br />Wright offers some sage advice, such as working off anger by destroying tent caterpillar nests and never giving up on a plant until you've tried it thrice. He also suggests the need for a club for men who have given up golf and taken up gardening which he views as a superior activity. He has some suggestions about tracking the weather using hard to find antiques such as a Dutch weather glass that may be more reliable than &quot;modern&quot; technology. (My bones are more reliable than modern technology!!) He says one should not attempt to garden on torrid days and suggests laying in the sun as long as you can in October. He laments the loss of burning autumn leaves, and fireplaces consuming cedar or apple wood. He and his wife both think of their &quot;top&quot; garden on days when things are tough in NYC.

Along with many other readers, I missed Barbara Havers in Elizabeth George's latest `detective' novel. Sorry, but Debs just isn't the same. Barbara has some depth. However, to set A PLACE OF HIDING in Guernsey, George had to use someone who could actually travel there and conduct an investigation. Since Lynley and Havers are British cops they have no jurisdiction in Guernsey. That St James and his spouse are able to do anything given the downright hostility of the local gendarme, stretches credulity almost to the breaking point.<br />George writes what some critics characterize as a \\"cozy\\" mystery-a setting associated with a big old house, several possible suspects (not the whole world), and a victim with many character defects and/or lots of money potential heirs covet.  The mystery is solved within a few days by a \\"hero\\" (sometimes a cop, sometimes not), who has little dependance on forensic evidence.  Generally, the plot is the strong part of these types of novel and there is little character development.<br />Although George is very good and I'll read her in a pinch, I much prefer books by P.D. James-and when he was writing the Morse series, Colin Dexter. Perhaps the quality of the mystery is associated with the author's age. Miss Marple, Poirot, and Morse, although very different had lived a bit and understood human nature--as had their creators. Dalgliesh, the son of a vicar, is troubled by existential issues and has a creator in her 80s. Both Lynley and St James are young, relatively well off, and apparently both pretty good looking. Most of their problems seem to involve interpersonal relations with the opposite sex (girlfriends, spouses, or wives, and in Lynley's case-Sgt. Havers). Perhaps as she grows older George will bring a deeper sense of existential angst to her main characters, but at this point, she does not appear to be able to do so. She had several opportunities in A PLACE OF HIDING, but did not follow through. At times, I get the feeling that George would like to write like George Simeon (the master of the psychological novel) or Agatha Christie (the queen of mystery plots), but does not have the skill. As far as I am concerned she gets a B- on both plot and character development in this book. I still buy her books, however, which tells you something about what is available on the market.<br />George uses &quot;notions&quot; that remind me of material found in novels by other authors, most obviously LIVING WITH THE ENEMY by Roy McLoughlin--which she acknowledges. McLoughlin's novel is set in Guernsey during WWII. What will mystery writers do for plot material when they can't harken back to WWII. Go back to WWI, I suppose.

The best historical sources about this series of wars include Polybius a Greek attached to Scipio Africanus the Roman hero of the second Punic War, and Livy a Roman historian who wrote in the late first century CE. Sources depicting the Carthaginian perspective disappeared long ago. Adrian Goldsworthy relies on the writings of Polybius and Livy, Roman Senate records, other extant material such as Cato's writing on agriculture, as well as archeological findings from various excavations to describe the hundred years' war that ended with the destruction of Carthage.<br />The first war between Rome and Carthage was fought over and about Sicily and ended with a Roman victory and possession of Sicily. The second Punic War was dominated by the Carthaginian Hannibal who conquered Italy with elephants and dominated the peninsula for a very long time. Unfortunately for Carthage, the Romans never acknowledged Hannibal's conquest. As Goldsworthy puts it, comparing the Romans to the Brits in WWII, \\"He who conquers is not the victor unless the loser considers himself beaten.\\" Although Hannibal beat the Romans to a standstill, they regrouped and attacked-not Hannibal-but Spain. Then Scipio Africanus conquered large areas in Africa. Finally, when his home town was threatened, Hannibal left Italy, went home to Carthage, engaged the Romans in battle and lost.<br />The third Punic war was a disgrace. Rome had defeated Carthage in the second Punic War, and it appears not to have posed a `real' threat to Rome. However, day after day Cato harangued on the Senate floor that the Carthaginians were building weapons of mass destruction and should be invaded and destroyed. Finally, he persuaded his fellow Senators who declared war. Rome attacked Carthage and destroyed it. In the end, the civilization founded by the Phoenicians was in ruins and Rome had become an Imperial tyrant.<br />The legacy of the Punic wars may have been the end of the Roman Republic. In the beginning, the Roman military was composed of yeomen farmers who volunteered for service along with  members of the other classes. The upper classes taxed themselves to support the first and second Punic wars. By the third Punic war, yeomen farmers had been replaced with large agricultural farms held by wealthy men like Cato. Roman citizenry from the upper classes disdained military service and the army was largely composed of mercenary forces made up of the dispossessed. This professional army eventually dominated the country though Gaius Marius, Sula, and the Caesars.been the end of the Roman Republic.

I read it with a flashlight during the Isabel-caused-East-Coast-blackout this past week so you can deduce that the book is entertaining enough to get your mind off the lack of light and air conditioning, and presence of rotting food. However, you can read this book under the covers at Girl Scout camp after lights out-its definitely PG-13.<br />Oh, I thought Walters was going to go somewhere with her plot.  I expected the worst. I expected some of these characters to be the `people of the lie'.  But, this is not `The Sculptress' or `The Ice House' and this is definitely not the `Scold's Bridal.' Has Walters returned to writing text for day time tv?  Granted, there are some violent scenes involving a fox or two, but what would you expect from characters who get their kicks chasing one poor little helpless animal through the underbrush with a pack of dogs. Other than that, violence or the threat of it is largely nonexistent.<br />There are a few unnerving scenes, but the protagonist has just returned from a stint with the army in Bosnia, so the reader might not feel as concerned as if the stalker had come upon a little old lady in her nightgown-which he does early on and which is related after the fact. I can't say too much more without revealing the plot, but Walters might have made this book at least as scary as those ghost tales we told round the campfire at Scout camp if she had given Edgar Allen Poe a closer reading	2003-09-26

Over the years, I've read a number of excellent `first' novels followed by mediocre second, third, etc. novels.  Hopefully, Jacqueline Winspear will be able to match her excellent first novel MAISIE DOBBS with the future series of stories she promises. Winspear has created an extremely likeable and interesting heroine and complemented her with a unique supporting cast of characters as well as an intriguing plot or two. With the exception of one relatively implausible scene and an exactitude of description that at times makes her tale somewhat formulaic and distracting (do I really care about the color of the little bows on the client's wife's shoes?), I found this book a good and interesting read.<br />Maisie Dobbs `exists' in the late 1920s, but the book contains a good deal of material describing life in the Belle Epoch and the period during and immediately after WWI. The horrendous loss of millions of men in WWI left women like Maisie facing an uncertain life without the prospect of a mate and children. What could one do but become a strong single woman who earned her own keep. .<br />Winspear deftly explains though her somewhat deconstructed tale how Maisie's young life shaped her latter life-where we find her at the start and ending of the tale.  Maisie came to have an understanding of psychology and the occult, and she turned to medicine as a career choice she abandoned after the war.  Maisie uses forensics in the tradition of Sherlock Holmes, an understanding of human nature in the Miss Marple sense, and has a penchant for getting into tight situations ala Harriet Vane. She also drives a `motor' Capt. Hastings would have adored. I like Maisie Dobbs and I hope to see her in print again very soon.	2003-09-26

If you've read and appreciated Elizabeth Sheldon's PROPER GARDEN and can distinguish among the varieties of sage and salvia you will probably enjoy her `sequel' TIME AND THE GARDENER a little more than if you have not and can not.  Sheldon has traveled all over the U.S. giving talks on gardening to mixed audiences.  Her colorful slides and gardening anecdotes are always appreciated no matter what the background of audience members, however, she does not write for the novice or new gardener. In addition, whereas PG at least included a number of colorful illustrations, there are none in TG.  So, it helps if you are an experienced gardener who can visualize in the mind's eye how Lathyrus thunbergii might appear when surrounded by asters (particularly A. Frikartii `M&ouml;nch') and dusty rose chrysanthemums.<br />I heard Sheldon speak at a conference held at the National Wildlife Federation headquarters here in the Washington area.  I enjoyed the talk and her beautiful slides but also noticed that over half of the audience was composed of landscape designers, nursery staff, and other gardening professionals while most of the other folks were people who were hiring these professionals to work in their gardens. Only a few of the attendees were \\"very good gardeners\\" (some with `Master\\" gardener status) and non-pro.<br />Sheldon's advice is best suited to gardens in areas comparable to Ithaca New York-zone 5 with plenty of rainfall and rich black loam. If you can't grow a garden in the Finger Lakes area you are really a failure. If you don't live in zone 5 and/or don't have rich black loam from the last ice age, you will have to improvise to implement Sheldon's suggestions. You might be able to pull off some of her combinations but not without a great deal of effort. If you can't use her gardening advice, you can still enjoy her sketches of famous women gardeners also included in this book. However, be warned, Sheldon is neither as amusing as Henry Mitchell nor as philosophical as Allen Lacy so don't expect more.as Allen Lacy so don't expect more.	2003-08-30

If you have a relatively novel understanding of Tarot, a Christian or Jewish background, and limited exposure to ethnographic concepts, Pollack's 78 DEGREES OF WISDOM is the place to begin your studies. Then take up her SHINING TRIBE.  Pollack's 78 DG uses the Waite pack which is about 100 years old and based on decks from the early middle ages. The Waite iconography is Judeo-Christian and very Western (Joseph Campbell and some of his followers uncovered connections that predate the Judeo-Christian).<br />The ST deck includes icons, motifs, etc. from around the world and as far back as the Neolithic (or further). Pollack's ideas seem quite right to me.  I find an amazing connection between the painted and sculpted works from all over the world and the Tarot. But that is exactly what makes Tarot so amazing. No matter what belief system you \\"recognize\\" the information is in the cards.<br />For example, look at the Ace of Stones.  Pollack substitutes Stones for Pentacles, which have also appeared as disks and coins. All are symbolic of earth or material reality. The Ace of Stones is an obelisk-like object in Pollack's ST. The obelisk can be found in ancient Egypt and on the Mall in Washington DC. (It's not terribly surprising that a penis-shaped rock should be named after the father of our country.) Pollack says the upright stones that can be found many places, including Stonehenge, form a connecting line with the earth, a vertical axis running from the world under our feet to the world of the spirits over our heads. The upright stone is known asa  lingam (phallus of Shiva) in India. (You may recall Indiana Jones association with the lingam?).  The Ace of Stones symbolizes connectedness, creative power, long-lasting achievement.  Surprise, surprise. On the other hand, maybe you should go straight for the SHINING TRIBE. (THE SHINING TRIBE is not a reprint of the earlier THE SHINING WOMAN Tarot. The new Tarot is more universal than the older version per Pollack.)RIBE is not a reprint of the earlier THE SHINING WOMAN Tarot.

Fernand Braudel is thought by many to be the greatest historian of the 20th Century. MEMORY AND THE MEDITERRANEAN certainly supports this contention, as it reveals a comprehensive understanding of a complex area over many thousands of years. Published after his death, M&amp;M was originally written in the 1960s, although much of the text was updated before Braudel's death in 1985. Roselyne de Ayala and Paule Braudel edited the text published in 2001. Furthermore, Françoise Galtier, Chief Curator in the Department of Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquties at the Louvre and Jean-Louis Huot, Professor at the University of Paris read sections of the book and provided comments concerning current thinking on various issues (footnoted in an appendix).<br />I found Braudel's book extremely well written and easy to read (translation by Siân Reynolds). I think anyone with a keen interest in this area and period could follow this narrative. I have a personal interest in goddess-centered religions, so I was very pleased to see that Braudel covered this topic throughout his narrative. In addition, the book contains a nice section of photographs of \\"Images of Religion\\" with numerous examples of female goddesses. For those interested in technological issues, the book includes a nice photographic section showing various sailing vessels. A good but not perfect section of maps has been added at the back of the book. There are some technical errors (page numbers of illustrations, etc. incorrectly noted), but I suggest the editors examined content, not publication niceties (copy editing just ain't what it used to be!!). Because Braudel covers the Middle East from the Neolithic period to the Romans, his book nicely complements Bernard Lewis' HISTORY OF THE MIDDLE EAST which covers the past 2,000 years, beginning with the Romans and is also relatively easy to follow.<br />Whether he intended to or not (and I believe he did), Braudel makes the case that s/he who is uninformed about the history of the Mediterranean is badly informed indeed Although he covers many aspects of the Mediterranean past, Braudel's major focus is the Levant and Greece and their interaction. Over several millennia, hundreds of civilizations formed and dissolved in this ancient and tortured land. Apparently, warring parties and/or outsiders never learned to leave well enough alone. None of the conquerors left a lasting impression, not even the Greeks who held the Levant for thousands of years.<br />I enjoyed this book because Braudel wrote with the confidence of one who understood his subject well. Although he does not spend a great deal of time on any single person or group, he provides numerous citations for those who wish to follow up on various aspects of his discussion.  I think the book provides an excellent overview of a complex place and is a must for anyone seeking the big picture of past times and an understanding of the current predicament in the Middle East..the history of the Mediterranean is badly informed indeed Although he covers many aspects of the Mediterranean past, Braudel's major focus is the Levant and Greece and their interaction.

Charles Elliott proves one thing, being an expert in one subject does not necessarily make you an expert in another.  Elliott writes well and entertainingly, but his book THE POTTING SHED PAPERS leads me to believe he does not understand gardening or the natural world.  To hear Elliott tell it, men invented gardening and have been responsible for gardening and exploring the natural word ever since. Has he never heard of Vita Sackville, Gertrude Jekyll, Katherine White, Elizabeth Lawrence, Eleanor Perenyi, Rachel Carson, Annie Dillard, Louise Beebe Wilder, Margaret Murie, Katherine Scherman, Betty Flanders Thompson, Mary Austin, Maria Audubon, and many other women gardeners and naturalists? Oh yes, he gives them a nod here and there, but the focus of his essays are men and their experiences.<br />Speaking of men, I would have found Elliott's book far more interesting if I hadn't read Henry Mitchell, Allen Lacy, Michael Pollan, and Beverly Nichols and noted their apparent willingness to mention &quot;female gareners&quot; they had known and/or admired. Also, other garden writers have done a better job of covering the men Elliot discusses. For example, if you want to know more about Johnny Appleseed and apples, read Michael Pollen's BOTANY OF DESIRE.<br />Other than his patronizing tone and disregard of female gardeners and naturalists, I suppose the most irritating aspect of this book is Elliott's apparent disregard for nature. In my estimation, he approaches gardening as a battle to be waged, not an activity to be enjoyed. Unlike his Welsh and English neighbors for whom he has thinly disquised scorn (and one assumes this includes Prince Charles owner of a profitable organic gardening operation in Wales), Elliott never met a machine he doesn't like. He doesn't cultivate his plot working in harmony with the rhythms of nature, he crucifies it. He says he owns a very large rototiller which he uses to plow the earth with such enthusiasm he brings down fences. (In some circles, this is known as rape.) Anyone who knows anything about gardening knows overworking the soil destroys humus. Humus is the good stuff you need to retain moisture and nurture plants.  Organic gardeners advise planting half digested material from the compost heap directly into the garden. Half digested is the opposite of finely-ground particles produced by machines with gas powered engines.<br />I use organic gardening techniques and year after year have produced magnificent and productive plants loaded with flowers and fruits and vegetables.

ON HISTORY is the English translation of a book written by the French historian Fernand Braudel that first appeared in France in 1969.  However he is probably best known for his comprehensive works on the Mediterranean and civilization and capitalism in the west in the 15th to 18th centuries.<br />This book is a historiography of sorts and composed of several essays/talks he gave about the need to rethink what we mean by history.  He examines three concepts: 1) time; 2) the social sciences and their relation to history; and 3) history in the present age.<br />What do we mean by history? How does the historian decide where to focus (geography); when to focus (time); and what will be the subject of his focus (art, politics, etc. or all aspects of culture-civilization). Regarding the issue of time, Braudel suggests the social observer must see that the length of time that governs his focus is fundamental. Take the French Revolution for example. When did it begin? Some think seizing the Bastille was the critical moment. But why did the people of France decide to do this? What led to this moment. And when did the currents that led to the moment begin. And, more important perhaps from Braudel's perspective is what was going on in the meantime. How were ordinary people going about their lives?<br />In the end, the decision regarding time is subjective and this subjectivity is governed by ways of seeing-or social science perspectives. The sociologist is not concerned with the French Revolution or very much else that happened in the past. He might have read Comte and Marx as part of his graduate studies, but his current focus is on the here and now and what his survey results tell him. The demographer generally takes a longer view if in no other way than his age and sex pyramids, but his focus is on the processes of fertility, mortality and migration that drive change and affect the size, distribution, and composition of various extant population groups. These groups are generally encompassed by political boundaries that are of interest to geographers and political scientists. These social scientist are generally not troubled by the beginnings or repercussions of the French Revolution.<br />In his last secton, Braudel examines the effect of the past on the present. He says one might better understand the past by studying living fossils. He uses the work of the anthropologist (Marvin Harris) who studied the people of Minas Velhas, an old mining community in Brazil, as an example. He suggests the anthropologist focused on the present moment-it's kinship patterns and networks and perhaps the distribution of wealth or material goods where the historian might have looked a things a bit differently. He suggests all of us are the sum of everything that made us, but some people are more connected to the past than others. As such they should be studied by historians. He also suggests that civilizations are collections of cultural characteristics and these characeristics have a history. For example, take language. All words have an historical root.<br />Braudel is absolutely correct when he suggests social scientists generally have a restricted world view, and that this view shapes their findings and conclusions. Unfortunately, where funding drives research, the focus remains narrow.erally encompassed by political boundaries that are of interest to geographers and political scientists.

Part theological and part \\"how-to\\" THE SPIRAL DANCE includes many suggestions regarding Wiccan rituals and magical practices, as well as the role of witches in a changing world. Like it's counterpart, DRAWING DOWN THE MOON (written a few years later), the book explores the organizing principles of Wicca in the 20th century. Starhawk wrote her book in the late 1970s and the special 20th anniversary edition includes her insights 10 years and 20 years later. Her additional comments expand on her earlier positions and reflect increased wisdom.<br />Do witches meet in the altogether to cast a circle? Not the members of Starhawk's coven who gather in drafty old Victorian houses-although one can do so. However, the most important aspect of WICCA is not whether to appear skyclad at a coven gathering, but recognizing the spiral dance of life. The world is in flux. Things change. On a practical level, this means even the rituals for observing Esbats (Moon cycles) and Sabbats (Sun cycles or the Wheel of the Year) are not set in concrete. Furthermore, witches have an \\"acrostic\\" eye that allows them to see underlying mind-sets, patterns, and structures are not absolutes.<br />Starhawk's observations are as salient today as ever. She finds those who subscribe to absolutism (which \\"stems from an intolerance of ambiguity\\") and a dualistic thinking (good versus evil) dangerous. She suggests the fall of communism in Europe forced the dominant class to identify a new enemy for the purpose of retaining control through fear. During the 1990s, these \\"rulers\\" identified drugs, Satanists, a president afflicted with satyriases, and Sadam Hussein as \\"the enemy.\\"  However, none of these \\"evils\\" captured the public imagination and wrath. (Issue date of this 20th anniversary edition is 1999 - post 9-11 Islam may work as an \\"enemy\\"). Starhawk suggests feminism is necessary because it is inclusive, not exclusive, and can help change the structures of civilization that rely on violence as a solution. Imagine a world where feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, healing the sick, comforting the dying, protecting the environment, and behaving in a kinder, gentler way towards all living things was the dominant motif!! The opposite of feminism is a \\"witch hunt\\" mentality.<br />Wicca is an important spiritual counterpart for women because all the major religions of the world are male centered. This is obvious regarding the Judeo-Christian and Islamic views, but the organizing principle of Eastern religions is directed towards helping one find a kinder gentler self. Starhawk thinks women have mastered that side of their personal development and need to become more assertive and aware of their own needs. This awareness requires the acrostic eye-seeing that the male \\"only\\" structures have to go. Simply adapting to them produces a Margaret Thatcher.<br />Some members of Wicca envision a goddess-centered universe, but Starhawk and others recognize a higher power that includes both male and female aspects. She says the `All that is One' is neither male nor female. Humans can use the metaphors of \\"Goddess\\" and \\"Lord\\" to address what Joseph Campbell described as \\"the thing that stands behind.\\"olution.

The book is lovingly illustrated with `whimsical' drawings by William McLaren (one photograph of Nichols and his friend Reginald Gaskin collecting money for charity at the entrance to the Nichols' grounds).<br />Nichols was a \\"real gardener\\" who worked side-by-side with several hired gardeners described in his earlier books, including MERRY HALL, LAUGHTER ON THE STAIR, and SUNLIGHT ON THE LAWN. If you haven't discovered Beverly Nichols and you love gardening and/or visiting gardens, you are in for a treat.  His books are humorous and instructive, and definitely for cat lovers. (He wrote several books about cats).  In GARDEN OPEN TODAY, he takes you step by step through his current garden (he moved a few times and wrote books about several gardens) pointing out some of the more interesting flowers and features.<br />As usual, the best bits of Nichols' book are anecdotal.  His chapter on flower arrangers (apparently the bane of his existence) is hilarious. Nichols was a \\"loose bunch\\" kind of guy who detested those who \\"tortured\\" flowers in order to twist them into unnatural shapes. He often said that flowers were best left in the garden or picked for a loose and natural arrangement reflecting the perennial border. I suppose I get a big kick out his anti-arranger diatribes because I come from a family of garden club members and garden club founders and have had many encounters with the similar characters.

THE PERIOD OF THE WITCH TRIALS is the 4th and last volume to be published in the six-volume series edited by Bengt Ankarloo and Stuart Clark `Witchcraft and Magic in Europe'.  In some respects, I found this volume a small disappointment as it's thinner and less interesting than earlier volumes about `Biblical and Pagan' societies and `Ancient Greece and Rome' which relied heavily on archeological work. Still, the book contains first class scholarship and tells an important part of the total story.  The volume includes several essays.<br />Part 1. \\"Witch Trials in Continental Europe\\" investigates the secular record of the \\"trials\\" legal and otherwise that took place in Germany, France and the Mediterranean. William Monter suggests that since the 16th Century, many scholars have attempted to understand and explain the \\"witch burnings\\" which racked Europe in early modern times. He suggests while it is incredibly difficult to decipher the \\"mind of a different age\\" it is impossible not to link the burnings in the 16th Century with major developments of the age including the Reformation, counter-Reformation, and various political changes.<br />Monter suggests a major criticism of Luther and Calvin regarding the church of Rome was that it tolerated \\"pagan\\" behavior.  Early Christian theologians like Augustine linked the devil with witchcraft (from whom witches were thought to draw their power), but from the perspective of the reformers the church had not done an adequate job of acting on this information. The Catholic Church held that not believing in the devil was heresy and the church tried people for heresy--not witchcraft per se.<br />Monter compares the relative moderation of the tribunals of the Mediterranean Inquisitions with the secular jurisprudence of central, southern and western Europe.  He says that during this period \\"diabolical witchcraft\\" became a criminal offense meaning an activity involving secular government. People were tried for witchcraft by secular governments but seldom executed. Monter suggests most of the witch burning took place in villages where neither the secular government or the church had absolute control, and these villages (both Protestant and Catholic) tended to be East of the Rhine.<br />Part 2. \\"Witch Trials in Northern Europe\\" covers the Netherlands, Scandinavia, UK, and Iceland.  Expanding on Monter's essay, Ankarloo describes the judicial revolution that took place in the northern and western Europe. He suggests that during this period jurisprudence moved from an \\"accusatorial\\" to an \\"inquisitorial\\" position. The Humanist movement \\"enlightened\\" the judges who would not punish someone unless it could be shown that the accused had harmed another. Ankarloo also suggests that the notion that people burned for witchcraft were old crones is mistaken. At the early part of the witch burnings more men than women were executed and many of the victims of were children. In fact, the victims at Salem in the New World represent a good cross-section of who was executed for witchcraft in the latter part of the period.<br />Part 3. \\"Witchcraft and Magic in Early Modern Culture\\" is most interesting from my perspective. Stuart Clark explores the concept of magic in the early modern period and divides it into three categories.  He says evidence exists that \\"popular\\" magic was practiced by many people from all walks of life and involved healing and love potions and charms and curses. Another type of magic was \\"demonology\\" which the church connected to the power of the devil. The third category was \\"intellectual magic\\" which interested Francis Bacon and others associated with Renaissance thinking.<br />Clark includes a discussion about conflicting views concerning the connection between intellectual magic and the scientific revolution. He then goes onto discuss the politics of witchcraft, including the connection between magic and the exercise of power. Queen Elizabeth and other rulers of the age understood how magic could be used to support the concept of divine right, a notion salient in Europe until recently. The last essay alone is worth the price of the book.magic could be used to support the concept of divine right, a notion salient in Europe until recently.

Ellen Dugan holds `Master Gardener' status through the University of Missouri and according to her bio has many years of nursery and gardening experience. She is also clairvoyant and a witch with a sense of humor. As she is raising three teenagers all these skills are useful.<br />Dugan's book is a \\"user-friendly\\" introduction and guide to witchcraft. GARDEN WITCHERY is also a great resource for mothers and aunts and anyone else interested in fun-filled ideas for creating special gardens, places for divination and spell casting, Sabat holiday decor, and other pagan treats that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. Many of her suggestions, such as dying Easter Eggs with red cabbage leaves, can be found elsewhere, but Dugan is a practical witch and suggests it is not un-witchlike to buy Easter Egg dye. She uses natural materials at hand for many of her projects, but she recommends craft stores and yard sales as great places to stock up on supplies such as orange lights for Samhain or plastic colored eggs for Ostara.<br />Dugan not only provides the instructions for making and using many scented items, she includes some suggestions for growing the ingredients-although this is not a gardening book per se.  I grow many of the herbs she recommends, and can testify it isn't hard to maintain pots of lavender, scented geraniums, and other plants on a patio, porch, or balcony-as long as you have adequate sun and remember to water them occasionally. And, it is extremely rewarding to make sachets and other scented items with plant material you grew yourself. If you intend to use Dugan's recipes and want to grow your own ingredients, however, buy a good gardening book such as Rodale's ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HERBS which includes detailed information about the cultivation and uses of herbs (as well as how to grow them organically AND when they are noxious!!).<br />Although Dugan has many nifty ideas about gardening, the one concern I have concerning her advice is her recommended use of pesticides. This is quite ironic as she lists \\"eagle watching\\" as a fall pastime her family enjoys.  If you can skip the poisons (some witches do use them) and stick to her other suggestions, this is a nifty source for many child-centered or adult \\"fun\\" activities.use of pesticides.

THE COFFEE TRADER is not an intellectually challenging book, although it is somewhat informative and a mildly inviting \\"summer\\" read.  The setting is Amsterdam in the mid-17th Century. If you love all things Dutch you will probably enjoy the book more than if you do not. On the other hand, if want to know more about the Netherlands during the age of Rembrandt and don't want to engage in the taxing business of reading history, this little book may suit.<br />The main character, a Portuguese Jew name Miguel Lienzo, has escaped the Inquisition in his native country and is living in Amsterdam in the midst of a community of Jewish refugees. Although the author refers to him as a merchant, Miguel is really an early version of the Wall Street trader, whose fortunes are won and lost via buying and selling commodities-commodities he may not even possess. Commodities exchange is a zero sum game-someone only wins if someone else loses. If you eschew this type of business venture, you may not sympathize with the protagonist.<br />At the beginning of the book, Miguel, a reasonably devout Jew, has lost his way financially through a series of missteps associated with a failed sugar deal. In addition, his trading has affected the welfare of several others who now view him as an enemy. Miguel is about to embark on a new enterprise involving coffee that he hopes will remake his fortune. In the meantime, while he waits to recoup his fortune, he lives in the wet basement of a canal house owned by his brother Daniel who is described as a \\"merchant.\\" In addition to Daniel and Miguel, the house is occupied by Hannah, Daniel's wife (a closet Catholic), and Annetje a Dutch housemaid. Other Jewish and Dutch characters populate the book, and many of them including Miguel's business partner, a mysterious Dutch widow, elicit some interest.<br />The first three hundred pages of the book were well enough written that I finished the book in spite of finding the last 50 pages less than satisfying. There are too many characters, and some of the most important are not well developed. Although the plot shows some promise, I think the author failed to deliver the goods because the plot fizzles and the loose ends are clumsily handled. Everything that happens could have happened, but much of it is not plausible given the foreshadowing.

Although GREAT GARDEN COMPANIONS appears to be about what to plant with what, Sally Cunningham's book is about much more. Cunningham is a `Master Gardener' associated with the Cornell Cooperative Extension in upstate New York (growing zone 6) and has spent many hours practicing what she preaches in her nearby garden.  Her garden (as shown in diagrams and photographs) reminds me somewhat of those shown on National Public Television's long-running Victory Gardens (raised beds, yummy soil), but Cunningham's advice and ideas are 100 percent organic.<br />While many people understand organic gardening involves the use of raised beds, mulch, compost, and cover plants that enhance soil friability, retain moisture, and restore soil, few books discuss the ecosystem within which gardens exist. Cunningham works a large garden at the edge of fallow farmland (where the glaciers left very nice black soil), however, many of her ideas will work in a smaller and/or less fertile places.<br />Some of the more interesting sections of Cunningham's book cover \\"old-time\\" notions such as how to build row hedges that attract birds and act as wind breaks; how to identify insect friends and foes and cultivate the former while repelling the latter; why toads, moles, birds, dogs, cats and horses can be great garden companions.  For example, Cunningham says moles have been given a bum rap and dogs and cats can actually help you ward off the bunny rabbits and other critters who might make a meal of your lettuce.  Horses are a fabulous source of organic fertilizer-should you be so lucky to own one.<br />Cunningham uses virtually everything that is biodegradable to make compost. She stops by the side of the road to sweep up leaves and pine needles discarded by others. She rips newspapers into long strips and mixes them into compost piles. She buries composted material directly in the garden under straw and other coverings to decompose over the winter. These practices work. I have buried half-digested material next to my roses in fall and by spring produced fabulous flowers on 3/4 canes ordinarily measuring a third of an inch.<br />Regarding companion planting, Cunningham suggests mixing the members of \\"families (i.e. tomatoes, eggplants, peppers) in the same bed along with companion herbs and perennials. She suggests members of the same family have similar growing requirements and by combining like with like you will save work. This might be so, but many garden writers suggest the opposist--combining  plants from different families as companions. These writers believe the pests and diseases that attack one member of a family are likely to attack another member of the same family and by separating them you confuse the enemy. In addition, authors like Riotte (CARROTS LOVE TOMATOES) suggest certain combinations produce synergistic results. I tend to agree with Riotte, but like much else in life, you will have to experiment with various combinations to find the answer for your garden.sted material next to my roses in fall and by spring produced fabulous flowers on 3/4 canes ordinarily measuring a third of an inch. <br />Regarding companion planting, Cunningham suggests mixing the members of \\"families (i.e. tomatoes, eggplants, peppers) in the same bed along with companion herbs and perennials.

Spouses who've lost a wife or husband through death or divorce have something in common (whether they like it or not) and both Browning and Osler have something to say about bereavement.  Osler's book will help you handle the loss following the death of a spouse, Browning's book will help you fall asleep and forget your ex.  Osler's book is somewhat philosophical and for the recovering gardener, Browning's book is for the recovering partner.<br />Browning is the editor-in-chief of House and Garden magazine, and her series of short essays is reminiscent of those short \\"editorials\\" one in her position undoubtedly writes for such a magazine. Her writing is friendly but very general. Browning provides no detail about gardening-or redecorating for that matter. Her book is sort of \\"autobiographical\\" but she shares very little of any great import about herself or anyone else in her family (or ex-familia). The closest she comes to sharing her emotions occurs when she describes a bedtime scene where she lifted her son up by his pajama lapels when he mentioned her ex-spouse's intended and jokingly informed him that he was not to talk about \\"other women\\" in her presence.  In fact, Browning shares less about her self and family than the friendly passenger sitting next to you on a six-hour flight.<br />If you need calming, gentle, diversionary material to lull you to sleep on those nights when you are thinking obsessively about something that can be better addressed the next day (like causing serious bodily harm), this little book may help. If you want some \\"real\\" gardening stuff you should check out Osler's book.	2003-05-31

Azar Nafisi was interviewed recently on PBS radio and her \\"live\\" voice is as rich and warm as her written voice in READING LOLITA IN TEHRAN.  How remarkable that one who was so put upon by the ruthless regime that seized power in Iran around 1980 and continues today could write such a wonderful and compelling story.  Ms Nafisi says she thanks the \\"Revolution\\" because without it she might not have fully realized how wonderful freedom is.  She left Iran in 1997 to return to the US where she had obtained her education. At this time-according to the radio interview and book jacket--she teaches English literature at Johns Hopkins University.<br />Before I read Ms. Nafisi's book, I had a very negative view of Nabokov's `Lolita' which has been translated into at least two films, one starring James Mason and the other more recent version starring Jeffrey Irons.  The latter film version was not distributed to theaters in the US owing to an outcry from the US public about the content which included incest. I have to admit I was against showing of the Irons film in the US, but since I know nothing about the interpretation in the Irons film my thinking could biased.  Whatever the case for Irons' film, Ms. Nafisi has exonerated Nabokov as far as I am concerned.  Apparently, he was on Lola's side and trying to show the reader how really awful Humbert the stepfather was. Humbert blamed Lola (whom he called Lolita) for her own rape. I may finally read 'Lolita' or I may not, but I have a different perspective. Ms. Nafisi has written a book about Nabokov's novels that I plan to read since I am now convinced I not have given this author a fair hearing.<br />Ms Nafisi's memoir works on several levels. On one level, her book is literary criticism. Through her exchange with her students, she reviews selected works by several classic authors including: Nabokov, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry James, and Jane Austen.  On a second level she narrates the tale of a group of female students who continued their studies in English literary criticism at Ms. Nafisi's apartment after she resigned from her teaching position. (She resigned because the intrusion of the `Revolution' into her affairs and the affairs of the institutions where she worked.)  On a third level, Ms Nafisi is reveals how a civilized nation slipped into madness as the result of a `religious' movement.  On the highest level, this book challenges the reader to ask, \\"What is morality?\\"<br />I found myself laughing and crying as I read Ms. Nafisi's beautifully written book. She has an important story to tell, and I hope every person (especially women) in America will read this very entertaining and informative work. I sent a copy to my sister who is a high school librarian with the suggestion she encourage seniors to read the book. In my opinion it ranks with Victor Frankel's, `Man's Search for Meaning.' You can think of it as `woman's search for meaning'. Nafisi implies there is no difference between Nazis Frankel faced and the &quot;religious&quot; zealots she faced.continued their studies in English literary criticism at Ms. Nafisi's apartment after she resigned from her teaching position.

I love CARROTS LOVE TOMATOES?an update and revision of the original companion planting book. I used many of these ideas the summer of 1975 when I had a half acre garden. My traditional farmer neighbor laughed when I told him what I was going to do, but later in the summer when the insects devastated his vegetable patch he threatened to come over and pull up all my borage and marigolds. He had to admit I was onto something. We had a few mishaps?white and yellow corn planted to close together = polka-dot corn, but we ran beans up the stalks as Riotte suggests and it worked well. The Mexican bean beatles came to visit and stayed for dinner, but we soon learned how to control them. Marigolds in the rows and our evening search to destroy the yellow egg clusters ensured a good crop. My kids learned a great deal about ?real? survival that summer and they didn?t find it on tv. We had squash, melons, tomatoes, and all sorts of other vegetables, herbs, and flowers, and mixed and matched them as companion plants. At the end of the summer, I canned like crazy and made colorful jars of green beans and white and yellow corn. Everything we grew was organic and it tasted great.<br />Louise Riotte includes many suggestions from the first book.  Topics in the new edition include vegetables, herbs, wild plants, grasses and grains, and others. Considering what is planted where is important.  For example, you should not plant  peppers, eggplants, and tomatoes close together or in the same container. These vegetables are related and planting them close together inhibits growth.<br />Matching vegetables and herbs or avoiding combinations of vegetables and herbs that inhibit each other isn?t the only topic discussed in this book. Riotte says that tomato leaves can be pulped in a blender full of water and used as a spray that inhibits Black Spot on roses. Similarly, certain kinds of peppers produce a nice insect deterrent. I?ve grown Pyrethrum (a type of Chrysanthemum) in my garden for years. Pyrethrum has been marketed in the West as a bug repellent since at least 1828, but the Chinese are thought to have used it for perhaps 2,000 years.<br />The best news is that you don?t have to have a half acre to become a gardener and use these ideas. Today, I live in an urban area and have a very tiny lot. I have converted the whole thing into a series of gardens, but half the yard is in shade and vegetables need sun. So, I have placed containers along the driveway in the sun and off the walkway near the patio out back. I am also using many ideas for vertical gardening.

In TAROT AND THE TREE OF LIFE, Isabel Kliegman-who apparently believes you have to give it away to keep it-shares some of the knowledge and insight she has acquired through years of studying and working with the Tarot. Many authors have written about the Tarot and most have something useful to say to the reader.  However, the majority of these experts have linked the cards of the major arcana with various aspects of psychology, religion, and/or literature and ignored the cards of the minor arcana. Kliegman focuses her examination on the cards of the minor arcana because she says: 1) the minor cards are often treated as secondary but she believes they contain much relevant information; 2) the imagery in the minor cards is more accessible (unlike the major arcana which depict `archetypes', the cards in the minor arcana show \\"real\\" people doing more or less \\"real\\" things; 3) studying the minor arcana can illuminate the different gifts of the two decks.<br />Kliegman teaches English and comparative religion and it is evident from her writing that her background has contributed to the formation of some unique and inspired ideas about the links between Jewish mysticism and the Tarot. Although her primary purpose, as indicated by the title of her book, is to link the Jewish `Tree of Life' with the Tarot, she infuses her work with other religious material and connections as well as a bit of Jungian psychology. The most unusual aspect of this book-for which she makes a compelling case-is the notion that swords are symbolic of fire (and the thinking function) while wands are associated with air (intuition function and inspiration). Whether you agree with her ideas or not, you will want to read this book to expand your awareness. She is a provocative writer and her book complements Rachel Pollack's work on the major arcana and the minor arcana.  Kliegman lives and works in California, where she writes and consults on the Tarot.	2003-05-05

MASSACRE AT MONTSEGUR is a history of the church of Rome's persecution of `heretics' in Languedoc from early (1208) to mid (1244) 13th Century. First published in 1959 Oldenbourg's book  remains current, and it is both scholarly and extremely readable. If you are new to the subject, MM is a good place to begin reading about the religious persecution carried out by the church of Rome against the Cathars and other \\"heretics\\" in Languedoc during the Middle Ages.<br />At the time of these persecutions, the church of Rome appears to have been Machiavellian to the core (do unto others before they do unto you whether those others be `heretical' Christian sects or other religions), militaristic, and absorbed by the acquisition of material goods. Oldenbourg does not discuss how Christianity evolved from a religion based on faith and love to one dominated by the seven deadly sins, but he suggests the introduction of the Dominican Inquisition, first carried out by the church of Rome against the people of Languedoc, forever altered the religion. The Inquisition used torture and murder as a means to an end, and is probably the first historical instance of police-state terrorism.<br />According to Oldenbourg, in the 13th Century, the Cathars appear to have been more Christ-like than many members of the church of Rome -- else why would so many have been attracted to their point of view. Although Oldenbourg's sympathies appear to have been with the Cathars, he makes a superb effort to understand the motivation and actions of the church of Rome which persecuted the Cathars until they no longer existed. I believe his writing is fair and impartial, no small task as the vast majority of the extant records on this subject come from the archives of the church of Rome. In the end, the question to ask yourself is this...does anyone have the right to tell another what to believe?<br />Little is known about the Cathar religion. Apparently the movement was quite large as members of the Cathar faith could be found all over Europe. Church documents reveal the Cathar perfects and bishops drew inspiration from the Bible although their interpretation of the Bible differed from the official version sanctioned by Rome, thus they were \\"heretic.\\" Oldenbourg suggests the Cathar faith was an older version of Christianity than the religion espoused by Rome. (See THE CATHARS by Malcolm Lambert and the `Epilogue' by Carol Lansing in THE ALBIGENSIAN CRUSADES by Joseph Strayer for various perspectives on the Cathar religion.)<br />Excepting the siege and destruction of the inhabitants of Montsegur in 1244, Oldenbourg provides little information about the military operations of the crusaders who were ordered to Languedoc by various popes. For a better understanding of the sieges, battle tactics, etc. see the ALBIGENSIAN CRUSADE by Joseph Stayer which includes maps, diagrams, etc. and views the various encounters from the perspective of the assaulting Crusaders. For more information about the Cathars after the massacre at Montsegur, see THE YELLOW CROSS by Rene Weis.<br />This is an excellent book for our times when religious wars threaten from every side and relgious intolerance is increasing.

KITCHEN GARDEN by Richard Bird is one of the many books I've acquired about growing comestibles  outside the back door. When purchasing a book, I look for well presented, novel, and useful ideas. KG was printed in China and contains less than perfect but colorful and informative photos, and plenty of useful information. The book includes sections on: 1) vegetable (potager, salad bed), fruit (strawberry bed), and herb plots (taste of Asia); 2) container-grown fruit and vegetables for rooftops and patios; 3) climbing fruit and vegetables (bean arbors and pear tunnels); and 4) decorative beds and borders (apple border, herb border).<br />Each section includes a photo of a project, such as a potager, printed on a foldout page. Associated with each foldout page is a diagram of the project and other pertinent information including illustrations of various tasks required to execute the project, tool lists, plant lists, and other items. Although some of the presentations require more space than others, even folks living in townhouses with a space no larger than a deck or patio can benefit from the ideas offered in this book.<br />One of my favorites sections is the `Patio container garden.' You might ask what could anyone say about container gardening that has not already been said, but the answer is plenty. For example, Bird shows you how to secure your recently planted container so that birds and animals don't disturb the contents.  Having watched a squirrel roll around one of my containers yesterday (apparently playing, there was nothing in it but soil), I can attest to the random, senseless, and wanton destruction of run-amuck wildlife. Bird also shows in his patio container section how to irrigate a strawberry jar. In all the years I've reviewed books and plant catalogues, I have never seen his novel approach depicted.<br />If you're looking for a cookbook approach to kitchen gardening, as opposed to an encyclopedia of possibilities where you supply the creative combinations, Bird's book of clearly described and carefully planned projects is a good place to begin.

Anyone who enjoys whole foods cookery, herbal healing, and organic gardening will appreciate Crawford's observations. Those with a philosophical bent will appreciate them even more.  His reflections on a life lived close to nature are a bit like those of Thoreau or Jefferson, but Crawford appears to also be very much the guy who brings fresh produce to your local farmer's market.<br />Few of us have probably given much thought to the growing of garlic bulbs, which really consist of \\"cloves\\" that can be divided and planted or used to season everything from marinara sauce to stir fries. You might have noticed the green sprouts that begin to emerge from cloves of garlic kept too long in your refrigerator, but Crawford suggests garlic plants are difficult to grow because their life course is different from that of many other plants. Garlics have adapted to life in stressful places where rainfall is not always forthcoming but when they need moisture, they need moisture. To avoid death, the bulbs spend a good part of the year \\"resting\\" or dormant. In a chapter called \\"Waiting\\" Crawford says that's exactly what the garlic farmer does. Much of the year, garlic like other bulbed plants are in hiding, and the farmer must be patient and wait until they are ready for the harvest.<br />But Crawford's interaction with plants isn't only about garlic. He relates how he \\"tasted the landscape\\" as a child in his native California-peeling and chewing the white pulp of anise growing by the side of the road in winter; sucked the syrup of nasturtiums, smelled the pepper tree berries, and searched the orchids for loquats, limes, and mandarin oranges.  Today, children are not so fortunate. Pollution, chemicals, other noxious matter have made much of the landscape dangerous.  Crawford toyed with both conventional and organic farming. He says he wishes to ask those who enquire whether his products for sell at the weekly market are \\"organic\\" if they lead organic lives. Do they earn their money in organic ways. He says, \\"Perhaps in the poisonous desert of the city there is little else you can do besides seek out what you hope is \\"pure\\" food. In addition to being informative and philosophical, Crawford's book is provocative.y in organic ways.

While THE EURO-AMERICAN CONTAINER GARDEN COOKBOOK may sound appealing to the average cook and gardener, this book is not what you might imagine. Instead of the home gardener like me growing a few pots of vegetables and herbs on the back patio, the target audience for this book is the commercial grower who is trying to sell her wares to thousands on Mother's Day.  Although the book description relies on food metaphors such as \\"a dash of creativity\\" and \\"ingredients\\" and \\"recipes\\", nary an onion or carrot makes an appearance.  Instead, the reader will find pages of diagrams showing one how to construct container planters, window boxes, and hanging baskets filled with annuals.  This is petunia city with a few marigolds thrown in for sport.<br />Although the average gardener is not about to become a merchandiser overnight, there are some interesting insights.  For example, did you have a clue that the lovely hanging basket you bought your mom last May probably held less than ten dollars worth of plants although you paid $35 dollars for it? Depending on where you live the cost will be more or less.  You might decide you want to create your own hanging baskets or window boxes after you discover the markup. If so, you can follow the diagrams offered in this book, or you could buy a really pretty book on container gardening such as Joyce Fingerhut's award winning (American Horticultural Society Book Award) CREATING AND PLANTING GARDEN TROUGHS, or if you are interested in growing food in containers check out the BOUNTIFUL CONTAINER by McGee and Stuckey.	2003-04-12

THE BOUNTIFUL CONTAINER is indeed a bountiful book. The two authors Rose Marie Nichols and Maggie Stuckly, pictured on the cover, look exactly like the friendly neighbors who know all sorts of things you want to know about tackling this subject. Nichols is a horticulturist who owns a nursery selling specialty seeds who is also the author of a book on herb cookery. Stuckley is a gardener who has written a few books including one on houseplants.<br />Nichols and Stuckley have written a gem of a book. My parrots like cilantro. As it costs a couple of dollars a bunch per week, I decided to grow the stuff in containers and save some money. I searched high and low for information about growing cilantro and could find nothing satisfactory until I found this book. First of all, the book tells me that it's best to grow cilantro from seed because it forms a taproot that may be broken in transplanting. Second, the book tells me cilantro gives two harvests because the seeds are called coriander. You may know coriander is the lovely spice in Christmas cookies. The plant does well in the cooler parts of the season (spring and fall) but the leafy growth may occur in cooler climates with staggered planting. If I want to, I can bring the plant indoors as long as it receives plenty of sun every day.<br />Nichols and Stuckly share many useful thoughts about various plants. For example, you might grow your lavender plants in pots near the door so visitors can brush up against them when they arrive and leave. Or perhaps you might grow curly marjoram along the edge of a container planted with catnip. The catnip will stand tall, while the marjoram trails over the edges. The colors and textures of the two plants will complement each other.  The two authors have suggestions about formulating your own tea from various herbs, stuffing squash blossoms with tomato sauce, and creating a pasta with summer vegetables. Don't miss this little book, it's filled with good ideas for the creative homemaker.maker.	2003-04-12

KITCHEN GARDENS IN CONTAINERS by Antony Atha is a nifty book with beautiful close-up pictures for tired eyes. Atha has created a useful and informative work. He shows the gardener how to make plant containers from scratch (wooden boxes, brick enclosures); convert items into containers (baskets, coffee cans, plastic lined buckets, wheelbarrows, etc.); or use the tried and true containers such as clay pots.  He also includes material on how to design with plant containers.  One nifty idea I am going to try involves growing combinations of food plants in the same container. I especially like the example of the strawberry jar growing cilantro in the side pockets and eggplants on top.<br />The back half of Atha's book lists container plants in his \\"Plant Directory.\\"  Not all plants are suited for growing in containers. Furthermore, some plants do well together and some do not. Atha divides his directory into herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Each entry includes information about plant tenderness, size, flower description (food plants have flowers), light requirements, propagation needs, and other information.  He color codes the sections: purple for herbs; green for vegetables, and terra cotta for fruit. At the end of each section, he includes recipes for the various items.  For example, under herbs you will find a recipe for a chamomile and bran face mask. Under vegetables you will find recipes for Borscht and Gazpacho.  The fruit section includes recipes for spiced peaches and damson jam. This is a practical book for gardeners with intermediate skills.	2003-04-12

Michael Guerra's EDIBLE CONTAINER GARDEN - \\"Growing Fresh Food in Small Spaces\\" is filled with unique insights and original photographs. Although I don't own a spread exactly like the gorgeous places shown on several pages in this book, I am moving in that direction, so the composition of the beautiful and practical gardens of others is of interest to me.  Each garden depicted in this book can be decomposed into elements that can be transported to almost any location and arranged in almost any way.<br />A fact of life in an urban area is compacted soil. The typical urban homesteader is unlikely to own a rototiller that can be used to plow the yard and create a friendly habitat for a few fennel plants (although these tools are becoming smaller every day).  Guerra's photographs and text describe projects that finesse hard surfaces. I especially like the partitioned timber container filled with many herbs standing above a graveled path. He also shows a raised bed with a most interesting set of joined corners using eyelet screws. The hardest surface of all to \\"farm\\" is a rooftop, but several photos show just what can be done with containers on top of a building.  The corn and beans growing at the edge of one roof with a street full of cars below make me wonder how any insects could ever find and destroy this produce.<br />Guerra suggests gardeners can recycle materials and employ permaculture principles in urban settings.  One permaculture trick involves stacking and arranging plants in a canopied effect. Guerra includes a number of photos showing various structures one might build to grow plants vertically thereby maximizing the use of space while conserving water. At the back of his book he includes photos of his own urban lot where he uses every square inch above and below to grow food-bearing as well as flowering plants.<br />Guerra's book is a great place to start if you've been thinking about creating your own little Victory Garden and wondered what might be possible.

PHARMAKO-DYNAMIS and PHARMAKO-POEIA by Dale Pendell contain much of interest to gardeners, artists, historians, drug counselors, and drug users. Pendell suggests that how a plant substance is defined (poison, drug, medicine) depends on the dosage, length of use, and intent of the user. In other words, if plant-based drugs are \\"abused\\" the problem lies not in our plants but in our selves. He says the reader can begin anywhere in either of his two books and arrive at the same place. I read PHARMAKO-POEIA last, not because it isn't interesting, but because coffee, tea, and cocao are covered in DYNAMIS.  As a tea drinker, I wanted to find out more about my herb of choice before I ventured onto others.<br />POEIA includes a wonderful section on Absinthe which may be related to the seduction of angels. Students of 19th Century French art history and the Belle Epoch know about Absinthe. Absinthe is that lovely green substance the Impressionist painters liked to portray, which according to some was the devil's own drink (he being a fallen angel).  Wilde was fond of Absinthe, and may have been using it when he wrote \\"The Portrait of Dorian Grey.\\"  On the other hand, it may have been his drug of choice when he developed his witty and amusing stage plays.  Readers associated with Lewis' Screwtape Letters will recognize Absinthe's plant name-Wormwood. Wormwood was probably the bitter herb offered Christ in his last hour of agony and Revelations 8:10,11 has something to say about it.  Artemisia is Wormwood's proper name, and the Greek Artemisia is the Roman Diana, Goddess of the Moon. Pendell says Oberon uses `Dian's bud' to reverse the effects of a love potion in A Midsummer Night's Dream. What was Shakespeare thinking??<br />Besides Artemisia and Valerian, Pendell discusses a few other suspect plants I grow in my own garden, such as Papaver, the Opium Poppy. Oh the feds tried to ban it once, but all the little old ladies came after them and Poppy reigns supreme in American cottage gardens.  According to Pendell, the worldwide persecution of the Poppy plant continues even though Poppy plants (and Cannabis) have killed far fewer people than tobacco plants. This is wonderful wise book for crafty gardeners and their friends.cottage gardens.

Since my own interests include gardening, herbs, plant poisons, and natural pharmaceuticals such as caffeine, I quickly decided Dale Pendell's PHARMAKO-DYNAMIS and PHARMAKO-POEIA were must-read books for me.  These books are also for historians, drug counselors, people who write laws associated with drug use, those concerned with the impoverishment of countries invaded by world-based industrialized corporations, and drug users.  Think you aren't a drug user?  Other than tea, coffee, chocolate, wine, beer, the paregoric my mother fed me as a child, and the aether and morphine I ingested at different times as a hospital patient, neither am I. Incidentally, paregoric and morphine are related to opium and it's offspring heroin.<br />Pendell suggests the reader can begin anywhere in either of his two books and arrive at the same place.  I read the sections that interested me most and then backfilled.  I ended up reading all of PHARMAKO-DYNAMIS (the second volume) first.  This volume includes essays on coffee, tea, chocolate, kola, betel, Ma Huang (Ephedera), Khat, Coca, and Nutmeg.  Nutmeg??  Yes, nutmeg is a \\"drug\\" or herb of choice for some. You probably knew the poppy seeds on your bagel could lead to a positive on a drug test, but you might not have known that nutmeg in the proper doses could lead to euphoria, delirious visions, or headaches. Pendell says he prefers his nutmeg in eggnog.<br />Pendell writes provocatively, \\" Billions of dollars are spent to keep adults from having access to methamphetamines, while Adderall (amphetamine) and Ritalin (methylphenidate) are widely prescribed for children.\\"  Many of the plants with \\"suspect\\" pharmaceutical uses have been cultivated for thousands of years. Coca has been around for five to seven thousand years, and until the drug czars cracked down, it was an ingredient in Coca-Cola. The soft drink no longer includes it's namesake, but devotees can find the real stuff without a great deal of difficulty.  Pendell characterizes the attempt by governments to control \\"drugs\\" as a continuation of the 19th Century Spice Wars, and more or less an unmitigated disaster (and given the recent news the Columbian drug lords may have links to terrorism, one must be concerned about this).<br />My favorite drug, or drug of choice is tea (Camilla Sinensis).  Fortunately, all sorts of benefits are associated with tea drinking. Another favorite is cacoa, a favorite drink of shamans and Goethe, who had a life-long interest in both the drink and the mysticism.

The acquisition of a exhaustive background in contemporary sociological and/or anthropological theory is akin to Jesuit training. At the end of the day, you know that you don't know and you know that no one else know either, but you put doubts aside, settle on a core set of beliefs, and focus on a topic that provides funding. Although I spend my days measuring discernable patterns associated with categories of understanding recognized by mainstream social scientists, I devote many non-work hours reading about magic and religion. Hence my interest in THE NEW COMPARATIVE MYTHOLOGY by C. Scott Littleton.<br />Littleton characterizes his book as an anthropological assessment of the theories of Georges Dumezil. In Part 1. Background - Littleton describes the influence of Frazier, Durkheim, Mauss and other members of the French school of sociology. In Part 2, he describes the synthesis that took place as Dumezil studied Roman and Hindi \\"myths\\" and became aware of similarities between the two religious systems that led him to form the theory of Tripartition. Dumezil suggested a \\"three-part\\" structure could be discerned in Indo-European myths and social organization. Part 3 of Littleton's book includes a discussion based on material from Benveniste, Wikander, Gerschel, Frye, Kuiper, and others who conducted additional research, and either praised or criticized Dumezil's ideas.<br />As a former student of a student of Rodney Needham, I find any discussion of Structuralism as practiced by the French sociologist Levi-Strauss and his followers intriguing. Needham has translated some of Dumezil's writing probably because it is related to structuralism. Regarding this linkage, Littleton says that Dumezil discovered tripartition via \\"the abstraction of a specific set of structural principles from a specific set of mythic and epical texts. He did not bring to bear a general model, Hegelian or otherwise, of what the I-E ideological structure should be.\\" In Littleton's words, the inductive versus the deductive approach.<br />In a note to the third edition published in 1982, Littleton says in recent years students have asked why anyone cares about Dumezil's ideas. He suggests these notions are important because 3-part thinking underlies the Western worldview [I-E = hegemony] and influences the way conclusions and opinions are informed.nductive versus the deductive approach.<br />In a note to the third edition published in 1982, Littleton says in recent years students have asked why anyone cares about Dumezil's ideas.

If you think you can bring a parrot home and toss him in a cage and throw him a few vegetables and seeds everyday, and he will entertain you in return, guess again. Parrots are smart, and you are setting yourself up for a very large hassle if you don't take the time to find out just how smart they are (they can talk and understand what they say). D'Arezzo and Shannon-Nunn reveal just how smart these birds are by providing a very good overview of what bird owners need to do to keep their pet parrots entertained. That's right, the bird may entertain you, but the price you will pay or suffer the consequences is entertaining the bird. PARROT TOYS AND PLAY AREAS includes all sorts of toys-noisemakers, destructible and non-destructible toys, puzzles, preeners, push-`n-pull toys and plenty of other items that will lead you to believe you don't own a parrot, you own a three-year-old going on 12.<br />Not all toys must be hand-made. The bird owner can find toys ready made at a local pet supply outlet. Some items made for other purposes also serve as parrot toys. Dog rawhide, whisk brooms, and cotton mop heads can be purchased at your local grocery or pet store. Wireless clothes pins are a little bit more difficult to locate, but can be found in craft stores. Plastic chains can be found in hardware stores. The list of toys provides a clue. Parrots like to dismantle things. D'Arezzo and Shannon-Nunn suggest if you don't provide them things they can destroy you can expect them to destroy other things-like your furniture for example. Bringing a parrot home is not so different from bringing a puppy home.	2003-03-22

At first glance you might think IN THE FRENCH KITCHEN GARDEN is nothing more than a good door prize.  This pretty little book is not very expensive and whereas cheap and beautiful often suggests a void, FKG is packed with all sorts of good ideas for creating your own little kitchen garden. From Ms. Brennan's perspective, the French kitchen garden is a soup garden or potager where one grows vegetables, herbs, strawberries, melons and \\"cutting flowers, such as zinnias and nasturtiums.\\" She also suggests that although the proper garden would not include trees which shade vegetable plants and flowers and reduce production, occasionally, one includes a fig tree or some other small fruit tree.  Generally, the produce grown in the potager is consumed as the season progresses (soup to soup so to speak)  with nothing leftover for canning or preserving although some items such as winter squash and potatoes might be stored in a cool dry place for a short while.<br />The concept of a year-round garden is European, and therefore a foreign idea for most Americans whose only spring crop consists of daffodils. So among other contributions, Brennan encourages the reader/gardener and/or novice potager to think differently about the use of space heretofore only used to grow a few tomato plants and pole beans. I have been a 3 season flower gardener most of my life (spring-summer-fall) but in recent years have attempted to have a good-looking winter garden.  My winter \\"crop\\" has been more structural than not, consisting of dried grasses, dried sedum and other \\"interesting\\" plant forms that are decaying and bird friendly. Ms Brennan has inspired me to rethink my approach and seek out more information about four-season vegetable gardening. Winter for example is a great time to plant onion sets and grow leafy items in a cold frame. If you're thinking about growing the old-style Victory Garden, or want to know more about the soup garden, Brennan's book is a good place to begin.	2003-03-22

GUIDE TO THE SENEGAL PARROT AND ITS FAMILY is the best book I've read so far on parrots. I am a new owner of a very sweet little Senegal who kisses me on the lips and I want him to stay sweet so I am absorbing everything I can on parrot behavior. I read this book from cover to cover before I brought \\"Baby\\" home, and have been consulting it ever since.  Anyone contemplating purchasing a Senegal parrot or related bird such as Meyer's parrot, Red-bellied parrot, Brown-headed parrot, or Jardine's or Cape parrot might want to consult books written by the experts including this guide. The one thing you can be sure of according to these authors and the folks who sold me my Senegal is that although these little birds can be loving life-time companions (they live 30-40 years) they can also be turned into laughing vicious little devils with improper care.<br />Between them, Mattie Sue Athan and Dianalee Deter have years of experience raising Senegal parrots and close relatives.  They share their knowledge-gained though pain-and the pain of a parrot bite is no laughing matter. Having been bitten a time or two (not by Baby!!) I can testify that parrot beaks are deadly weapons. Athan and Deter stress that when a parrot bites he does so initially because he is hurt or frightened. Unfortunately, if he gets a comic response (his point of view not the point of view of the bitten) he may do it again and again. Somehow, the little guy gets a charge out of seeing a big human scream in pain. Nipping this behavior in the bud is important.<br />Parrots also are destroyers. They love to take things apart in a non-gentle way. Even if you give them love and food and attention every day, you will still need to provide \\"toys\\" for their amusement. Why do they tear and break things apart? Athan and Deter say that you have to remember that in the wild parrots have to crack nuts, shred sugar cane, and generally decompose plant life to get at food. Birds in captivity have the same instincts as wild birds. Unless you come to understand the needs of the wild bird in your tame parrot, you may find yourself in a very difficult situation.  Parrots are a lot of work and not for the timid. However, anyone who's ever been bitten by the bird \\"bug\\" will understand why parrot lovers don't mind.ld birds.

I cut up a kiwi-fruit and apples the other day and placed it on them table where I throw seeds and other items for the wild birds that dine on my patio, and although the birds consumed the apples within an hour, no one seemed interested in the kiwi.  Now I discover I gave it to the wrong birds. The Senegal parrot loves kiwi according to SENEGAL PARROTS.  They also like mangos and bananas, and figs and dates and cherries.  One of the best bits of Pamela Hutchinson's little book is the list of items one can feed Senegal parrots plus recipes for making `Birdie Bread' and `Sweet Beak Bread' and `Bird Bean Soup'.  Hutchinson's book also includes sections on housing Senegal parrots, toys for Senegal parrots, and other issues associated with the care and feeding of Senegal parrots.<br />Hutchinson includes information on breeding and hand feeding baby parrots, but I have no experience with raising baby Senegal parrots so cannot comment on the quality of this material. In fact, if you're like me and a new bird owner, you might find this material a bit off the point.  Hutchinson does provide the potential new bird owner a service, however, because she asks some pointed questions one should answer before buying a parrot. Parrots are not like budgies, canaries, or other smaller birds. Parrots are smart and will require plenty of your time. If you are not prepared before you purchase your parrot, you may find yourself in heaps o trouble after he comes home. Before you make a major purchase, you might want to make a minor purchase (this book) and read all about Senegal parrots.	2003-03-22

If John Morris never wrote another book, his AGE OF ARTHUR would have to be described as a lifetime achievement.  I bought this book because I've been fascinated with King Arthur for some time, and this book is THE history of the period before, during and after Arthur. Only about one-fifth of the pages in the book are about Arthur's life, but Morris convincingly describes Arthur's time and his lasting effect on the cultures and governments of the British Islands. He also makes a convincing case that history is not predestined.<br />THE AGE OF ARTHUR covers a period that has been condescendingly labeled the \\"dark ages\\" by some. Morris suggests this age is not so much obscure as it has been overlooked.  (Or was at the time he published his book. Many new \\"early Medieval studies&quot; were published in the 1990s). Morris demonstrates that scholarship about this era can be carried out by using annals; lives of the saints; law codes; land grants and religious charters; \\"histories\\" such as those written by Gildas and Bede; graffiti and tomb inscriptions; poetry; chronicles; wills; genealogical records; archeological evidence from cemeteries, burial mounds, and barrows, houses, villages, encampments, battle fields and other sites; and linguistics analysis. He has done a magnificent job of identifying and synthesizing much of the extant material. His book is loaded with suggestions for scholars who want to continue investigating this era. I doubt you will find a better book for an overview of this period or for research leads.<br />Among other topics, I was intrigued with the various ways the Welsh (Angle for foreigner), Irish, Scots (Latin for Irish), and German peoples including the Angles of Arthur's age dealt with everyday issues. Their social and legal problems were not so very different, but the Irish and the Welsh (Roman Britains) appear to have been somewhat more practical and humane. They were much more concerned with compensation than revenge or punishment and more than once Morris refers to them as early humanists.

If you are planning a trip to England and/or Wales and want to know which gardens are open on what days, plus which of those days selected gardens are open for charity, this is the book to buy. GARDENS OPEN FOR CHARITY (2003) is updated every year. The 2003 version is sponsored by &quot;Carr Sheppards and Crosthaite&quot; and contains every thing the avid gardener and/or garden lover and/or visitor will want to have on hand to plan a vacation, a weekend excursion, or a day out. I ordered the 2003 version of the &quot;yellow book&quot; from Amazon-UK and received it very quickly.<br />Gardens open almost every day through the year, or the growing season plus those only open for special events are included. You can obtain information about all kinds of gardens including the Botanic Gardens (Oxford University) and Hidcote Manor Garden in Chipping Camden (National Trust) that are accessible most of the time to privately owned gardens such as Lambeth Palace (Archbishop of Canterbury) that are only open to the public on special occasions.<br />England and Wales are divided into shires and maps are shown for each jurisdiction. The gardens discussed in the catalogue are noted on the map. This is one of the best if not the best guide you will find to gardens in the U.K.	2003-03-09

In the words of a local newspaper, grass is out and vegetables are in -  even in the urban yard. KITCHEN GARDENS are the most \\"in\\" of all gardens and this handy little book by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden is a good place to start if you're thinking about growing your own vegetables at home. The book is small but loaded with information. Although some of the photographs show acreage not often found inside the city, many of the photos and suggestions are helpful for smaller patches. Topics such as optimizing space by rotating crops, sticking plants in unusual places (along the driveway), windowsill gardening, and the old standby container gardening are all discussed. You can dig up the back yard, the side yard, and the front yard and plant a mix of vegetables and flowers (which are often edible).<br />KG provides lists of plants you might grow, including a variety of tomatoes. My new nursery catalogues have arrived and one of them (White Flower Farm) offers a package of three of the tomato plants  recommended by this book. Tomatoes aren't the only things you can grow, however. Beans, eggplants, carrots, and peppers can all be found in the kitchen garden. Okra, squash, and other vining plants can be escorted up trellises and over fences. You might grow greens and other plants that require good drainage in raised beds. Nothing like a bowl of fresh mesclun salad or a pot of steamed baby pac choi you just picked.<br />I like the book because it shows you how to get started with &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; kitchen gardening. The book is attractive to look at and pleasant to read, and it organizes many good ideas under one cover. This is a good buy for the beginner who might not want to invest a great deal of money in a bigger more expensive book but wants first-class information from the experts. About one-quarter of the book covers regional variations in kitchen gardening (about 6-7 pages per region). Given you probably live in one of the regions discussed, you should be able to use most of the book.you should be able to use most of the book.	2003-03-07

Joan Dye Gussow may be a suburban homesteader as her book jacket suggests, but she managed to live in two places one does not ordinarily associate with suburban tracts-an old Victorian house on a large plot of land in Congers New York and a second half acre plot on the banks of the Hudson River in Piermont New York (featured in Woody Allen's film The Purple Rose of Cairo). At the latter site sat an Oddfellows Hall which the Gussows hoped to rehabilitate but discovered after having begun their project they would have to tear down and rebuild.<br />Gussow does not spend a great deal of time describing the new house with a room for her artist husband and a root cellar, but she does go into detail about the gardens the two of them developed before, during and after the new house was built. For awhile, the Gussows were living in Congers and gardening in both places. On top of that, the couple was involved in converting the eyesore parking lot and general dumping area next door to their new house in Piermont into a community garden.<br />Dr. Gussow's husband died two years after they moved into the new house in Piermont, so to some extent her book is a memoir of their last few years together gardening. Gussow is a nutritionist and was a college professor and lecturer before she retired. She has written several books on nutrition, food, and gardening and is an advocate of organic gardening and eating locally grown foods in season. She says if you can't grow them yourself in a home plot or community garden center, then join a cooperative that supports a local farmer. At the very least, shop the farmer's markets in your area, learn how to store foods for the winter, and avoid eating out-of-season produce. The incredible waste of energy expended to grow and import tasteless foods and the conventional (as opposed to organid) practices used to produce most fish and meat are destructive to both human health and the environment.	2003-02-22

THE CREAKY TRAVELER provides an amazing amount of detail (including maps) about a small part of the northwest highlands of Scotland. Mr Rovetch has a friendly and somewhat avuncular writing style which verges on the pedantic at times. He obviously kept a diary of his travels from which this text has been extracted (the minutia could only be recorded not remembered).  I found some of the detail annoying for \\"armchair travel\\" but useful for objectively planning road travel in remote Scotland.  After using it to plan a trip,THE CREAKY TRAVELER is the sort of book one reads a chapter a night on the road to scope out the next day's adventures.<br />Rovetch and his wife Gerda who prefers the sobriquet \\"G\\" are in their late sixties-early seventies and still mobile, though as he says \\"not agile.\\"  Although Rovetch provides helpful hints for \\"older\\" folks, younger adventurers may find many of the suggestions useful. I bought the book because I have been seriously contemplating visiting the highlands when I travel to the UK this summer. Rovetch has convinced me road travel is the only way to go, and road travel in northwest Scotland cannot be knocked out in a few days. Also, if you truly hope to \\"see\\" anything, high summer is probably not the very best time to go.<br />Rovetch suggests limiting the miles covered to under 20 per day given the condition of the roads (the path is narrow and the way is hard) and the joy of slowly savoring one of the world's most beautiful rural areas. Rovetch and G made their several week journey in May when the countryside was filled with new lambs and few tourists. The places they stayed were picturesque and relatively pricey. This is a good guide for the practical traveler.	2003-02-15

Rachel Pollack's SEVENTY-EIGHT DEGREES OF WISDOM is a key work described by many (including Joseph Campbell) as an important source for understanding the wisdom of the Tarot. The book appears to have been first published in the early eighties in two volumes, one dealing with the Major Arcana and the other with the minor Arcana.  Since few authors examine the minor cards Pollack's book is a must for serious students.<br />Pollack writes insightfully and intelligently, including longer passages for each of the cards of the Major Arcana. She includes reversed meanings and encourages shuffling the deck so as to ensure some cards fall upside down for a reading. She provides two examples for each card, one from A. E. Waite's deck illustrated by Pamela Coleman and the other from various other decks. Pollack notes that when she first wrote her book no one compared the different pictorial representations of various decks.  She includes points of agreement and disagreement with interpretations from Waite's \\"The Pictorial Key to the Tarot\\", Aleister Crowley's \\"The Book of Thoth\\" and other works.<br />Unlike many contemporary authors on Tarot, Pollack subscribes to the notion that one can use the Tarot not only for interpretation of current circumstances but for seeking advice. She describes how to cast the Celtic cross a descriptive tool which can be used to gain insight into a present situation. She also shares a layout she created that the reader can use to gain insight into possible courses of action regarding work situations. Of the many books I've read on Tarot so far this one is the best.	2003-02-03

I've been fascinated with myths and dreams and prophecy for some time, so I found John Matthews book TALIESIN THE LAST SHAMAN quite intriguing. The book has two parts: 1) an exploration of what is known or thought to be known about Taliesin who was probably a real person who lived in the 5th - 6th centuries in Britain as well as an interpretation of what Taliesin's works represent; 2) a collection of Taliesin's poetry translated by Matthews and his wife Caitlin.<br />Taliesin was probably British or Welsh although he might have considered himself something else-perhaps Cymry. The Romans described the inhabitants of what is today the United Kingdom as British, while the English referred to them as Welsh-their word for foreigner. Matthews refers to Taliesin as Celtic (Keltoi), a word the Greeks used to describe the people of northern Europe. Matthews describes the Celtic society that probably produced Taliesin and links his poetry to the Celtic view of the cosmos. He sees Taliesin as a \\"wise\\" man who penetrated the secrets of the universe and then attempted to share his vision via words.<br />Since I don't speak or read ancient Welsh or Irish, I can't pretend to know whether or not Matthews' interpretation of the Taliesin poetry is good or bad or even accurate. Although the book is not from a mainstream academic source, Matthews appears to be relatively scholarly, frequently citing from respected works and noting where his perspective differs from that of others. He also uses contextual material to locate Taliesin in time and space as an historical person. This secondary material seems to be consistent with various academic interpretations.	2003-01-29

As far as it goes, GENTICALLY ENGINEERED FOODS is an excellent book. My only complaint is that the research to date on this topic is pathetic. Of course this is exactly what Ronnie Cummings says. For whatever reason, the Clinton administration and the current administration don't seem to be overly concerned about what is happening to our food supply. The amazing thing is that most GMOs hit the market in the past 10 years. If you weren't paying attention in the 1990s, you need to know that you probably were not alone. The bottom line is that the food you are eating today is not what we ate as recently as 15 years ago.<br />We all heard about the Monarch butterflies and the bovine growth hormone, but most of us had no idea just how many organisms--plants and animals--had been altered and were now part of the food chain. Cummins book describes just what we missed and although he writes somewhat provocatively, much of what he has to say is being said by others.  In fact, the Monsanto potato has been discussed in many books and articles. Fortunately, big businesses like McDonald's are beginning to pay attention.<br />Since the government can't or won't act, bringing about a difference will be up to the public.  You can vote with your food dollars. Although you may not be ready to go completely organic (you really should for your health's sake) you can at least avoid the worst kinds of foods. The bottom line is that we really don't know what GMOs will do to the human body. I for one am not ready to be an experimental subject and I certainly don't want children to become subjects either. Read this book and act.	2003-01-26

SKELETON AT THE FEAST involves intrepid reporter Laura Ackroyd and friend D.C.I. Michael Thackery of the Bradford police force.  Michael has been placed on leave following the death of a subordinate and is attending a two-week course at Oxford designed to make him a better administrative copper. Thackery attended Oxford as a young man, where he played rugby but never quite fit in. Following graduation, he returned to his North Yorkshire roots to become a police officer and has not been back in 20 years.<br />While attending the course, he crosses paths with old lecturers and tutors and one of them asks him to look into the disappearance of a local don who apparently left with a young female employee of \\"Friddie\\", Thackery's old school. Thackery's unauthorized investigation into the disappearance of his former school fellow and rugby mate soon sets off a chain of events that leads to the unearthing of skeletons galore.<br />Meanwhile, Laura is back in Bradford crossing paths with Kevin Mower who is distraught following the death of his former colleague and Val Ridley, blonde copper with a big crush on Mower.  The Bradford police force is searching for the fiend who attacked a young girl living in council housing whom he left for dead. Never fear, Laura finds the way to Oxford where she links up with Thackery for a little sleuthing and romance.<br />I love this series, but begin with the first book. The strength of Hall's stories is characterization. Each book builds on the last.	2003-01-23

Patricia Hall's latest novel about Yorkshire newspaper reporter Laura Ackroyd (apparently a Nicole Kidman lookalike) and her friend DCI Michael Thackery takes a sad turn in DEEP FREEZE. Hall has never shied away from tough subjects (she probably covered them as a reporter) and her latest novel continues this trend.<br />A young girl named Dana Smith is shot dead as she leaves the hospital where she recently had an abortion. Was she killed by an aggressive member of the anti-abortionist crowd badgering the clinic daily? Was her death simply another aspect of the crime wave being carried out against her gypsy family by local skinheads? Or, did her death have something to do with the fertility work underway at the clinic? Laura is a female reporter and thus never asked to write the \\"crime\\" story by her male chauvinist editor, but she soon turns her \\"woman's\\" piece into an investigation of suspicious medical practices, antagonistic anti-abortion activists, and unhappy ex-wives. Meanwhile, boyfriend Thackery has his own clues to pursue and his own ghosts to fight.<br />I have read Hall's books from the gitgo, I find her protagonists Laura and Thackery well developed. Hall  also does a fine job of developing minor characters such as feisty grandmother Joyce Ackroyd, who turns up regularly to protest outrages against women; Val Ridley, the blonde cop who lusts after Kevin Mower her counterpart on the Bradford police force; and Kevin Mower who seems to be going off the deep end over his recent losses. To truly appreciate this series, including the current angst Mower is feeling, the reader should begin at the beginning. Reading Hall's books is akin following a good police/reporter series on tv. Hall is not into forensics, nor does she do graphic violence. Her plots are clever and her characterization is well done. This is exactly the kind of book her Grandmother Joyce would enjoy.	2003-01-23

White and Elizabeth Lawrence--A Friendship in Letters	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Trip down memory lane...via the garden path	The TWO GARDENERS in question are Katherine White of New Yorker fame and Elizabeth Lawrence who wrote a garden column for years for the Charlotte Observer in North Carolina. White's columns on gardening written for the New Yorker magazine were compiled by her husband E. B. White (CHARLOTTE'S WEB, STUART LITTLE) and published after her death in 1977 in the book entitled ONWARD AND UPWARD IN THE GARDEN.  Lawrence wrote a number of books, including THROUGH THE GARDEN GATE and THE LITTLE BULBS. Her book THE MARKET BULLETINS was completed by the New Jersey gardener Alan Lacy. The market bulletins were wonderful publications farm women in the South used to communicate information about seeds, plants, animals, receipts (what they called recipes), and other items they for sale or being sought. Elizabeth shared a good deal of information about the market bulletins which were not published north of Virginia with Katherine whose one interests lay with garden catalogues when their friendship began.<br />Lawrence and White corresponded for several decades. The two women discussed their gardens, their columns, their books, and their lives. In the early part of their correspondence, they often wrote each other by return mail. Toward the end of Katherine's life, the letters were few and far between as illness began to affect her movement and ability to see. In spite of their  suffering, they continued to observe the world around them and relay how things were going in the garden-the latest blooms, the ravenous mice, the unexpected cold snap, the new greenhouse. Their words remind me of the hope and comfort women have long experienced when a letter from a loved one arrives. As my 87-year old aunt with whom I still correspond says, it doesn't matter what you write, the smallest thing matters.<br />The editor of this collection of letters Emily Wilson, quotes a librarian who remarked after having read the letters Elizabeth and Katherine wrote to each other, \\"I got a feeling of moral interdependence on a creative level.  Somehow I had viewed the creativity of successful people as a strong force that perhaps needed channeling but not encouragement. Now, on this new-to-me-plane, I see again that no man is an island.\\"l interdependence on a creative level.

Turner has done a masterful job of assembling, analyzing, and interpreting the extant material about THE REAL KING ARTHUR. He presents a coherent, comprehensive, and scholarly opinion.  He suggests the last Romano-British Imperator, Lucius Artorius Castus was the man we know today as Arthur. He says Arthur not only preserved the Romano-Britannic culture for two generations following the demise of the Western Roman Empire, he decisively shaped modern Scotland, and modern Wales, which still flies his `Red Dragon', is his legacy.  Although the invaders from the continent (Anglo-Saxon) eventually conquered most of the island, they did not subdue the Celtic culture which can still be found in the western parts of the United Kingdom.<br />Turner's book is complexly written and filled with detail. Scholars will recognize his sources...Patrick, Gildas, Nennius, Bede, the Mabinogian, and Geoffrey of Monmouth, etc. In addition, Turner draws on recent archeological evidence to support his work.  His knowledge of Latin, as well as the ancient Anglo-Saxon and Celtic (Welsh, Irish, Scots) languages is impressive. Using language as a tool, Turner first identifies and then links the relevant puzzle pieces. For example, he suggests Arthur's sister Anna Ambrosia (known as Mawr-anna or \\"great Anna\\" in her lifetime because she was the sister of Arthur) and the Celtic war goddess Morrigan became conjoined in the transmission of the Arthurian tales until, by the time of the Middle Ages, the French Romances characterized her as Morgan le Fey-traitorous sister and necromancer.<br />Arthur's stepfather Aurelius Ambrosius was the \\"utherpendragon\\" (overall big dragoon or \\"chief war leader\\" in Celtic) or \\"Magister Militum\\" (Latin). He married Ygerna, Arthur's mother after he slew her husband Gorlois (Arthur's father) in a battle for supremacy in southwestern Britain. A more recent example of this Celtic practice occurred when the Welsh Henry VII (red rose) married Elizabeth of York (white rose) after he slew her brother Richard III, thereby uniting the royal households (Tudor Rose). Turner suggests there was no prior connection between Aurelius and Ygerna and that Anna was Aurelius' daughter by a former wife. Aurelius, lacking a male heir, adopted the adult Arthur just as Julius Caesar adopted Augustus Caesar, his sister's son. Geoffrey of Monmouth did not understand the Roman practice of adult adoption so he used the wizardry of Merlin to explain the inconsistency between Aurelius' and Ygerna's wedding date and Arthur's birth date.<br />Probably the most interesting sleuthing Turner does involves the identity of the real Lancelot. Apparently, Anna's son and Authur's nephew Medrawd (Celtic) or Medrautus Lanceartius (Latin) was a brilliant horse soldier known for his skill with a lance. The gallant Mordred was left to guard the home front while Arthur was away, and he became restive and adulterously involved with Arthur's second young wife the beautiful but bored Gwenhwyfar (Findabair or white phantom because she was blonde). Understanding his uncle would probably kill him for his actions, he plotted Arthur's destruction which sadly led both to their deaths at Camlann in 542 A.D. In the Middle Ages, the Romancers could not grapple with the complexity of a man who was both good and bad, so they divided Medrautus Lanceartius into Mordred and Lancelot.) after he slew her brother Richard III, thereby uniting the royal households (Tudor Rose).

THE COCKATIEL HANDBOOK probably includes most everything you want to know about cockatiels. Matthew Vriends is a Dutch-born ornithologist/biologist with an advanced degree in zoology. He has written many books on birds, and traveled extensively all over the world including Australia, the native habitat of the Cockatiel. Dr. Vriends includes material on feeding, grooming, housing, health care, training and breeding of cockatiels which he has apparently done for years.<br />In his first chapter, Vriends includes an overview of what to consider before you buy your bird. Throughout his book he elaborates on these initial points. He says costs should be a consideration if you intend to have healthy and happy birds. He includes text and photographs that show the kinds of cages, aviaries, and breeding boxes you might build to house your birds. He covers the diseases, illnesses, and accidents that can affect bird health and vet bills. He describes physical attributes of cockatiels such as hooked beaks, growing claws, and flight feathers must be addressed to avoid problems.<br />Vriends suggests an appropriate diet to maintain health including the types of seeds cockatiels should eat, their vitamin requirements and vegetable preferences, and daily water intake. Vriends says the following, &quot;No matter how hard you try, you cannot give your cockatiels the type or great variety of food they would find in the natural habitat. Birds in cages and aviaries should therefore be given a menu that is as high as possible in quality and variety...In the last few years, 'easy -to-feed pellet diets have become very popular. These types of diets can be placed in clean feeders or dispensers, and the birds can eat when and as they choose....Extruded diets are not new...but they are the newest alternative for pet birds...a cockatiel [..] that has spent it's life feeding on a diet consisting largely of seeds is not likely to become suddenly enthusiastic about extruded diets and/or pellets. Converting a bird to such a diet can sometimes be a difficult task and may require much patience. The best method...(goes on to explain his method)...&quot; I understood Dr. Vriends to be saying pragmatic things, not championing seeds over pellets as another reviewer suggested.<br />Dr. Vriends also discusses the upside and downside of whether to have more than one cockatiel and how your cockatiel might relate to children and other pets. He includes a number of photographs of children holding apparently content and loving cockatiels. He suggests ways you can interact with and protect your bird including training tips, sleeping requirements, and toys.Converting a bird to such a diet can sometimes be a difficult task and may require much patience.

Although his book presents plenty of material on bird health care and preventative maintenance, his main focus seems to be on diagnosing and dealing with the various ailments that afflict pet birds. His book contains all sorts of graphic illustrations of sick, deformed, dying, and dead birds he probably photographed in his clinic. His photos might prove useful for determining whether or not you need to take your bird to a vet (is the ailment life threatening) or if you can treat it at home. He also suggests first aid for birds before you take them to the vet. The jacket proclaims the book as the definitive work in print on the subject of bird health care, and I have no reason to doubt this is true since it seems very technical.<br />While Gallerstein has written a useful book (especially his suggestions for keeping your bird healthy via good feeding practices, grooming, and cleanliness), he comes at the topic of living with a pet bird from a medical standpoint. This book is excellent for helping the lay person (and perhaps the professional??) diagnose an ailment. However, if you're interested in bird behavior, bird psychology, and training your bird, you will have to check elsewhere.  THE COMPLETE BIRD OWNER'S HANDBOOK can be a useful addition to your bird book library. However, if you can only afford one book, you may want to buy a DUMMIES book, for example, COCKATIELS FOR DUMMIES which covers all aspects of living with a bird and provides a good deal of useful anecdotal information.	2003-01-11

After Christmas, my husband and I visited the Animal Welfare League of Arlington shelter with the idea we would adopt a cat to replace our 19-year old kitty who died last year. I never made it to the \\"cat room\\".  I wandered into a \\"miscellaneous pets\\" area just off the entrance, and found cages of bunnies and ferrets and other creatures including a pair of bonded cockatiels. When I was a child, my grandmother raised love birds, and I had always wanted my own bird, but the presence of cats made that difficult.  Currently catless, I decided to take the birds home. After I purchased two cages, and a few other things at the shelter, I made a trip to the local bird store for seed, pellets, cuttlefish bone, toys, and other assorted necessities the shelter folks recommended. When I told the proprietor of the bird store I was a new owner, she recommended COCKATIELS FOR DUMMIES.<br />Over the past few weeks, I've been seeking all the information I can find about cockatiels. Although my daughter and daughter-in-law have pet birds (love birds, parakeets, and a dove) none of us knows much about cockatiels. Diane Grindol's approach to happy and healthy cockatiels includes advice about preventative health care maintenance, but she also provides plenty of suggestions for ways to bond with your bird. She gets down to the nitty gritty with: what to feed your bird and why; how to maintain his or her cage; why wing clipping, toenail trimming, and other grooming matters; what it means when a bird molts; how to distinguish between nutritious and poisonous plants; how to avoid bird hazards like scented candles, the toilet bowl and Teflon-lined pans; what to do if your boy bird masturbates on his food cup; and how to avoid reproduction without stressing the female, but the best tips involve how to have a good relationship with your birds.<br />Grindol's book is perfect for a novice like me who knows plenty about wild birds but precious little about caged birds (actually two cages since the male was a bit hen-pecked so he spends part of the daylight hours in a separate establishment). So far, I am doing really well with my feathered friends who have a place of honor next to my PC (but far enough away they won't be radiated).

One of the sad realities of growing older is that you realize what is being lost daily, and that unless we educate younger people they will not miss these things because they will not know they ever existed. For instance, says Allen Lacy in his book FURTHER AFIELD, the wild Cyclamens of Greece and Turkey are systematically dug up and shipped to unsuspecting buyers in the U.K. and the U.S.  Lacy's friend Nancy Godwin of Montrose nursery in NC has worked hard over the past few decades to ensure that Cyclamens grown from seed will reach American consumers and hopefully undercut the trade in endangered bulbs.<br />In addition to his Montrose visit, Lacy reports on gardening activities in Costa Rica, Monticello, and many other locations where the dedicated are working hard to preserve our botanical heritage. His travels take him far from New Jersey, but he also includes many essays on shorter excursions, some into his own yard where Hosta and Gloriosa Lilies, Ailanthus, Bouncing Bet, Sedum and Sempervivums bloom. He reports that the Tigridia or Mexican shell flower is photogenic and although the Fritillaries are numerous, he grows the native of Northern Europe known as snake's head lily or guinea-hen flower.<br />Until his retirement, Lacy was a professor of philosophy who wrote a garden column as a sideline. He retired and kept on writing about the subject (and editing lots of good garden books). This book is a little older, but like the timeless tales of other great gardener writers who were also students of life relevant for our current lives. Reading Lacy is an uplifting experience for anyone with the winter blahs. Although he shares his concerns about things that should concern us, he also shares the victories he observes. His writing is reminiscent of Thoreau who made excursions abroad, usually to Waldon Pond, but sometimes further afield.	2003-01-09

The title of Sally Fallon's book, NOURISHING TRADITIONS, is a bit of a pun because her book nourishes both the body and the soul. Fallon has assembled a huge amount of material about food and life as lived in traditional societies in the past and all over the globe. The result is a wonderful compendium on \\"outlaw\\" food preparation. Fallon suggests many \\"diet doctors\\"  have made big mistakes regarding food-especially food from traditional sources. Their first mistake is that they rely on the USDA and FDA guidelines which are woefully inadequate since they are subject to corporate interests and they ignore information from non-U.S. sources. The second big mistake the diet gurus (some of them medical doctors) make is that they fail to inform about how you can determine the REAL nutritional value of foods. Counting carbohydrate and fat calories is not enough. You need to understand how the food was grown and processed, i.e. bad things happen on some farms (especially those run by large agribusinesses).<br />Many of Fallon's suggestions are accepted across the nutritional spectrum (banish refined sugar, flour, etc.), and some of her ideas have been accepted into the main stream in the past few years (value of Omega-3 fats), but most of her ideas are ignored although they are very sound. Fallon supports the notion that food growing and preparation in the old days was pretty good, i.e. traditional food preparation using organic foods is a healthy way to live. Many of the ailments modern folks suffer are brought about because of BAD food. Folks who practice traditional diets using organic foods are generally healthier.<br />Organic yogurt, ghee, free range chicken, miso, cod liver oil, honey, etc. are all associated with good health and long life. Unfortunately, simply buying \\"good\\" food in a supermarket is not enough. For example, you can buy honey, but unless you eat raw honey without pesticide and herbicide ingredients, you are wasting your time and money. Non-organic yogurt filled with sugar and other material has little or no nutrient value. Milk collected from abnormal cows and homogenized and ultra pasturized contains no healthful organisms, including the bacteria in the pus \\"modern\\" cows secret.<br />Perhaps the worst thing those on a weight-loss diet can hear is that many of the so-called \\"low-fat\\" and other lo-cal foods may actually cause you to gain weight. Some of the chemicals in convenience foods actually inhibit the thyroid.  I received this book as a Christmas gift, but if I didn't already own it, I'd buy it.yogurt filled with sugar and other material has little or no nutrient value.

Once upon a time...the stories from childhood begin.  Scholars now think fairy tales and many other stories are derived from more serious fables orally transmitted from generation to generation over thousands of years, until a redactor cast them into literary form. With the exception of the last two tales in Patrick K. Ford's translation of THE MABINOGI AND OTHER WELSH TALES, the stories in this book exist in manuscripts religious monks familiar with the `original' narratives prepared in the early part of the second millennium. For the most part these recorded versions appear to be relatively faithful to an oral tradition, however confused their narratives may at times seem to modern ears. In addition to  recording the tales, the monks appear to have used the tales to transmit Christian notions, just as Christian missionaries to Hawaii explained the triune God using the sacred tripartite banana.<br />The last two tales in the MABINOGI were set down in the sixteenth century by one Elis Gruffydd, an educated man of Welsh extraction (The Tale of Gwion Bach, and The Tale of Taliesin\\"). Ford says that although no manuscript dating from an earlier era has turned up, it is apparent from the structure of the stories Gruffyd recorded that the two tales are very old and may have been copied in earlier times and the manuscripts lost. Gruffydd apparently was familiar with the oral versions of the tales which were still being retold in sixteenth century Wales which makes them all the more remarkable. events.<br />The tales of the Mabinogi set down in Ford's translation are somewhat interlinked, much as a set of short stories might be today, or as the stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable were in the 12th Century. Characters in one tale show up in another and King Arthur shows up in The Tale of Taliesin (\\"shining forehead\\") the remarkable bard whose poems fill the last few pages of Ford's book. Ford suggests literal truth, moral insights and religious/philosophical/magical elements form the basis of these tales.  For example, a good deal of evidence exists to support the notion King Arthur lived sometime in the 5th-6th Centuries and Merlin may have been his counselor. On the other hand, the feats of Cerwidan the shape-shifting mother of Morfan and brewer of the cauldron of inspired wisdom are not as well documented, and may be largely mythical/religious. The feats performed by magicians and witches in these tales are quite amazing, but the creation of Blodeuedd (flower face), the wife of Lleu Llaw Gyffes (Lugh, the fair one with skilled hands), conjured out of flowers by Math and Gwydion, is the best.  She was transformed into an owl in punishment for her unfaithfulness to Llew which is why some owls have faces that look like \\"blowed\\"  flowers.ophical/magical elements form the basis of these tales.

Thinking of having your cheek swabbed and analyzed so that you can learn all about your pure Scottish heredity?  Before you shell out big bucks for a genetics test, you might want to read MAPPING HUMAN HISTORY by Steve Olson. Olson suggests tracking down your heredity via genetics is like taking a car apart. You thought you had a Volvo, but under the hood lies a Lexis engine. In other words, the original ingredients have been much altered. Twenty generations back you have about a million ancestors. Don't think for a moment you have all their genes.<br />Olson is the author of several books on biotechnology, but his book on genes was written for an educated non-technical audience. Once you sort of grasp what Haplotypes and Haplogroups are about you're on your way. Linguists, anthropologists, sociologists, demographers, paleontologists, and geneticists will recognize ideas expressed before. Some of the material, such as the court decision regarding Kennenwick man is already out of date. A big problem lies with the attempt to assemble tons of material into an integrated whole. In the end one must rely on other experts and the experts you select will affect your findings and conclusions.<br />Following the lead of Colin Renfrew, Olson elaborates on the notion that somehow if we could just combine the work of linguists, archeologists and, geneticists, we could map human history. And what we would find is that we are one big mixed up bunch of people. If fact, the next time you read an article that implies \\"diversity\\" is news, you can laugh. Diversity happened long ago.<br />People who want to believe that pure races exist will probably dislike this book. Race is a social construct not a biological fact. Biologically speaking, Americans are a big melting pot and the pot is inside each individual. Olson does not deal with the consequences of social constructs that lead to discrimination.  His purpose seems to be to inform those who will listen that we are all making a big deal out of something that is at best skin deep.deal out of something that is at best skin deep.	2002-12-19

THE PAGAN CELTS by Anne Ross is an older book, first published in 1970 and updated with more recent material in 1986.  Ms. Ross, a scholar of Celtic antiquities, languages, and literature (University of Edinburgh), has written widely on her topic. The Pagan Celts Ross identifies are an ancient people associated with the whole of what constitutes modern Europe.<br />The earliest evidence Ross presents comes from the `La Tene' and `Hallstatt' sites in central and eastern Europe, and the latest material she presents dates from the Roman period. She uses empirical evidence from archeological studies, literature from mostly Greek and Roman sources, and her knowledge of various languages to format her argument-the Celts had a homogeneous culture that spanned a large geographic area for hundreds of years. Ross has organized her material into several categories including, social organization, dwellings, defense, food production, language, the world of the spirit, and arts. For each of these topics, she presents material from a variety of sources. Ross does not limit her discussion to the British Isles.<br />I found the entire book interesting, but the section on \\"Art and Adornment\\" most fascinating.  One of the problems with material artefacts is determining what was made locally, and what was imported. Several thousand years ago, before the Greeks and Romans expanded their civilizations, the Celts apparently were trading with people from Asia. For example, a high-ranking individual found in a Celtic grave in central Europe (Hochdorf) dating from the Iron Age was discovered clothed in `Chinese' silk. Ross provides other examples of the incorporation of material from non-Celtic cultures to Celtic uses. Apparently, the exchange was two-way as both the Greek and Roman cultures incorporated material from Celtic sources.<br />The greatest challenge facing the historian-archeologist in identifying and dating material, particularly after the Romans began to stir things up, is determining which was which, and how the transfer occurred. Probably the most fascinating aspect of Ross' thinking is the notion that the Romans incorporated much that was Celtic into their culture. The end result was a `Romano-Celtic' civilization.  Ross' book is older but worth tracking down.termining which was which, and how the transfer occurred.

Unlike aspects of clothing that set individuals apart and indicate high status or clan affiliation, yellow crosses, like the yellow stars worn by Jews in Nazi Germany, or Hester's `Scarlet Letter' signaled the wearer was viewed as degraded by society. In the case of yellow crosses, the demotion resulted from a conviction for heresy-per the Inquisition conducted by the Roman Catholic Church in Medieval France. Punishment for heresy in the 14th Century included any or all of several possibilities: burning at the stake; imprisonment under harsh conditions; confiscation of property; and wearing yellow crosses.<br />Weis' story is about the Cathars of Montillou. He does not provide a detailed examination of the theological differences between Cathar and Roman Catholic beliefs. Nor does he write about the better known period of Cathar persecution involving the Albigensian Crusades and the destruction of Montsegur in southern France about 100 years earlier. And, whereas Malcolm Lambert's THE CATHARS \\"goes broad\\" providing a good overview of the \\"heretical\\" movement from it's inception to it's survival in Bosnia under the Orthodox Christian Church, Weis' goes deep, focusing on the lives of a few Cathars from  Languedoc during the years 1290-1329.<br />He notes this historical period included the rise of Robert the Bruce in Scotland, the persecution of the Templars by Philip the \\"Good\\" in northern France, and the conflict between the Guelphs and Ghiblines in Italy. Whereas other historians link the destruction of the Cathars to the political situation of the day, and/or act as apologists for the Church, Weis does not. There is no doubt where his sympathies lie and that he supports secular government and religious toleration. There is also no doubt that this story is as salient in contemporary times as it was 700 years ago. As the bumper sticker says, the last time we mixed religion and politics, people got burned at the stake.<br />Using \\"court\\" transcriptions based on witness testimony recorded in Pamiers in the early 14th century, Weis breathes life into the Cathars of Montillou who perished years ago-some in the Inquisitor's flames, others shackled in prison, and a few in their own beds. Their voices were recorded by religious scribes who witnessed the Inquisition and survive in a folio buried until recently in the Vatican archives (unlike Fournier's old bones that were unearthed and burned by the \\"Citoyens\\" of the French Revolution) - a folio the meticulous Inquisitor (later Pope Benoit XII) prepared as a reminder of his success.  Weis has done a fabulous job of reconstructing events by cross referencing the material with other documents. Much as a trial lawyer might do for the defense, he use the material collected by the prosecution to show another side.<br />It is easy to consign people who lived long ago to an anonymous pigeonhole and difficult to become outraged with those who made them suffer. However, just as William Wallace's biographer produced the book that led to \\"Braveheart\\", Weis overcomes the challenge of elapsed time. He depicts real men and women leading real lives-from the bread they bake to the beds they make. The Cathars appear to have been a peaceable people. They were weavers and clothing makers, shepherds and turnip growers. They did not proselytize nor did they persecute \\"other\\" Christians. Whether you agree with their world view or not, you cannot escape feeling for them.<br />Even though his sympathies are clearly with the Cathars, Weis' writing is even-handed. There are no graphic descriptions of flesh consumed by flames to incite anti-Catholicism. On the other hand, more than one \\"randy\\" priest makes an appearance. Weis visited Montillou and all the other places described in Fournier's folio and includes photographs and maps illustrating these location.  He includes everything from the arrangement of houses, fountains, fields, forests, churches and other extant structures in France to landmarks in Spain where the survivors fled. Using his book, you can literally follow in the footsteps of those who wore the yellow cross.pain where the survivors fled.

If you're off to Scotland in search of ancestral roots or the remains of them and want to travel the roads less taken, IN SEARCH OF ANCIENT SCOTLAND may prove useful. Gerald and Dorothy Ruzicki have collected material about Scotland from web sites and references guides (listed in an appendix section), and their own travel experiences, and created a somewhat unique guide.<br />The guide is organized into eight regions in Scotland and every site within each region is rated with 0-3 stars. The focus of the guide is historical places 5000 BC to 1700 AD, so Culloden Moor, for example, is not included in the `Index of Sites'. Included selections are organized along a time line in an appendix so that if, for example, you only wanted to visit only Medieval places you could do so.  Appreciative of the popularity of \\"Braveheart\\" the Ruzickis include a good deal of information about Stirling and Bannockburn and other locations associated with William Wallace and Robert the Bruce. Apparently, Stirling has much to recommend it beyond the `Braveheart' connections, not the least of which is an easy drive from Glasgow or Perth.<br /><br />What may be of great interest to the traveler with an \\"antiquarian\\" bent and plenty of time to drive to more remote areas, are ancient sites such as the `Standing Stones of Callanish' (Calanais) that rival Stonehenge; `Dun Trodden' and `Dun Telve' in the Northwest Highlands; and `Mousa Broch' that can only be reached by ferry across a temperamental sea. Later period sites closer to the central cities such as Jedburgh Abbey founded in 1138 by David I; Traquair built in 1107 AD and continuously inhabited since; or the ruins of Castle Tioram where Robert the Bruce once lived are also identified.<br />There are many interesting and useful books on Scotland, but if you're brave enough to travel independently and hankering to find ancient sites not always included in mainstream publications, check out this book. In addition to the \\"where to go\\" and \\"what to see\\", the Ruzicki's include much practical information about traveling independently, including a chapter on driving in Scotland.at to see\\", the Ruzicki's include much practical information about traveling independently, including a chapter on driving in Scotland.	2002-11-27

WE MADE A GARDEN is a lovely little book by Margery Fish, an \\"elderly\\" English lady who with her husband (he who must be obeyed or cleverly deceived it seems) moved to a country manor and converted the mostly lawn areas into gardens of shrubs, flowers, and herbs. First published in the U.K. in the 1950s, the book has been republished as part of the `Modern Library Garden Series' edited by Michael Pollan.<br />Fish's little book will be considered a gem by experienced gardeners who can picture the plants she names in the mind's eye, identify with her triumphs and failures, and appreciate a useful clues from an obviously seasoned hand. Garden veterans will also identify with the greedy gardener who never has enough space, the stubborn gardener who plants Nepeta despite it's runaway habits, the recalcitrant gardener who hides the verboten brilliant orange Lychnis chalcedonica at the back of the beds, and the disobedient gardener who leaves many openings in the cemented walkway hubby designed to thwart weeds.<br />The book may appear a bit dense to the new gardener as it describes activities such as composing flower beds, creating walkways, and engineering rock gardens with inferior rocks,with no illustrations, other than a few black and white photos-one of Mrs Fish on bended knee at work in her rock garden. However, all is not lost. Determined gardeners unfamiliar with the various plants Mrs Fish names can refer to a nursery catalogue since 60-70 percent of the plants available in the 1950s can be found contemporary mail order publications	2002-11-27

CANDLES, MEDITATION AND HEALING is a hotch-potch of a little book with no underlying  and unifying religious or spiritual tradition which may or may not appeal to the average reader. Whitaker suggests her book can be used by any spiritual person and she does not link her candle magic to a particular religious orientation. She tosses in a little of this and a little of that, and although I don't mind an eclectic mix, I do mind a mishmash. Unfortunately, as Whitaker mixes \\"Christian\\" and \\"Wiccan\\" themes, I find the book more disconcerting than comforting.<br />Many traditions hold with burning candles and incense.  From services and candle stands in Roman Catholic Churches to the Hanukkah candles to lighted vespers on feast days to incense and money in Hindu shrines, folks light up all over the world. We light candles for special meals, Jack-o-Lanterns, and in past times the Tannenbaum tree. Whitaker's little book lightly passes over all the glorious ways and whys folks light up and jumps into building home alters and burning specific candles (such as green) for specific requests (money) from some source to be named by the candle burner. If you're looking for innovation and can overlook an unstructured and crazy-quilt approach, CANDLES might prove helpful. If you're looking for something profound this is not the book to buy.	2002-11-27

BURGESS, MERCHANT AND PRIEST is a relatively new addition to the series of monographs on The Making of Modern Scotland published by Scotland House. This monograph (55 pages) contains a distillation of archeological material gleaned over the past 25+ years about burgh life in Scottish Medieval settlements. Sites listed include Perth and Stirling, plus the deserted burgh of Rattray and the essentially unaltered burgh of Clackmannan.<br />Settlers in the Scottish burghs appear to have been relatively religious, as shown by material from Christian churches, old grave sites, and miscellaneous items.  For me the most intriguing site is Elgin in the Northeast and the Highlands. Elgin was founded by David I in the 12th Century, and wonderful ruins still stand in the heart of the old burgh, including `the Elgin Piller' in the graveyard and the Main Door to the church.<br />Many other structures have been uncovered by archeologists, from blacksmiths workshops to hospitals for lepers and pilgrims, to farm enclosures. Merchant's seal, old shoes, bits of fabric including the remnants of Spanish silk, a knife handle engraved with a green man, bread ovens, bell molds, and Medieval corn dryers add to the list of \\"finds\\". In one of the burghs, Ayr, a Medieval bridge still stands.

When HYGIEIA-A WOMAN'S HERBAL by Jeannine Parvati was first published in July 1978, it filled a void. Much of what she had to say needed to be said.  If you're interested in historical artifacts (how dumb we were), this book is a good read. I believe much of Parvati's text will interest most contemporary women-at least women who have difficult questions and want to know more about the female body. Two decades ago, many of us fit that description as most medical research was conducted with male subjects. Most of what affected the female body was not discussed in public or even in books.  In spite of their notoriety, Master's and Johnson didn't cover this stuff and I doubt Dr. Ruth did either. Imagine your deepest secrets about your body, those things you might not be able to discuss with your best girl friend without difficulty. Well, Parvati is the girlfriend you never had.<br />Much of Parvati's material is geared to younger woman-probably because she was younger when she wrote the book and authors tend to write about their experience, but she does have some good stuff on menopause.  Given the outpouring of books on the topic of herbal healing in recent years, you might wonder what this book covers not found in other herbal volumes, and the answer is plenty.  Parvati's book is about herb uses and the reproductive organs of the female body.  Parvati organizes the herbs by topics, covering subjects such as aphrodisiacs to whet the sexual appetite, as well as herbs to improve fertility, assist with birth control, boost lactation, ease menstruation, et cetera. She has lots of graphic illustrations and pictures (naked bodies) and discusses herbal applications you probably won't find discussed anywhere else.<br />Parvati is Native American with a few other good qualities thrown in such as six children conceived and delivered a la natural. This is a book for liberated women (and men) or those who want to be.	2002-11-22

CELTIC RELIGION IN ROMAN BRITAIN by Graham Webster offers a rare glimpse into a culture from past times and ends with the assurance that the more things change, the more they remain the same. The past is ever with us in the form of religious practices, holidays, and rituals we cannot explain. Webster is a Reader Emeritus associated with the University of Birmingham in England-a scholar.<br />Webster reviews and distills what was known about Celtic religion in Britain as of 1986. He draws on material from various sources including archeological digs and his own background as a Latin scholar of Roman history.  This book is only 141 pages long, but filled with rich detail.  While we cannot know what the Celts thought, we can deduce much about their beliefs from the material they left behind in the form of everything from carved images to curse tablets.  We can also deduce much from what others wrote about them.<br />The Celts were not a literate people when the island the Romans named `Britannia' was invaded, but writers from literate societies, beginning with Greek ethnographers and geographers and including the Romans, especially Tacitus, Seneca, and Julius Caesar related a good deal about the Celtic people. The Greek ethnographers named them - Keltoi - pronounced with a hard K.<br />To a great extent, the early Romans allowed the Celts to practice their religion in relative peace (after they conquered them). Julius Caesar had a few harsh things to say about the Celts, but scholars know he was trying to drum up support for his military adventures when he described their \\"barbaric\\" behavior in letters to the Roman Senate. Fortunately, he was also an astute observer and recorded much of interest to modern scholars. Other Romans, especially the Stoics, also had interesting observations about the Celts, finding their monogamy, democratic attitudes, simple life styles, and the chastity of their women virtuous (and a far cry for what passed for \\"civil\\" behavior in Rome).<br />The Celts left behind a good deal of material, not enough to satisfy the avid scholar, but enough to make lay people happy.  Webster says the Celts did not have a pantheon of gods and goddesses like the Romans, but they did have a few important deities, such as the Deae Matres (goddess mothers), Rosmerta (a goddess of fortune depicted with a cauldron and cornucopia), and Sulis the healer who became associated with Mercury.  Many of the attributes of the Celtic gods and goddesses were later ascribed to Christian saints.  Many of the practices such as leaving offerings at holy sites, lighting candles, immersion in holy water, and most of the holidays on the Christian calendar come from this period.  (Webster suggests Christmas festivities may be based on the Roman holiday Saturnalia).<br />CELTIC RELIGION is an elegant little book and a great synopsis of a fascinating period.<br />The Celts left behind a good deal of material, not enough to satisfy the avid scholar, but enough to make lay people happy.

I had read a few of her cook books, and decided to read a biography of Elizabeth David's life (WRITING AT THE KITCHEN TABLE by Artemis Cooper), before I read LUNCH WITH ELIZABETH DAVID. I'm glad I did. Roger Williams probably provides the reader with enough information to make the necessary connections to David's life, but I know my prior reading enhanced my experience. I think I would have profited a bit more if I had read some of Norman Douglas' books before reading LUNCH-at the least \\"Old Calabria.\\" Fortunately, I had read other authors who'd written about Italy in the \\"old days\\" before WWII.<br /><br />Williams' writing is reminiscent of Nabokov, Durrell-and Elizabeth David. I think his book is very literary in tone and substance, and as is often the case with \\"classical\\" works, some of the content is distasteful, although this interpretation is subjective on my part, and not perhaps how Williams sees it. Norman Douglas more frequently than not went about with young boys in tow, and was described by more than one court as a pedophile. I find pedophilia disgusting, but I'm glad I did not follow my first impulse which was to throw the book in the trash bin because it contains more than allusions to this topic.<br />The main focus of the book is not Douglas, as the book jacket suggests, but the effect he had on other lives. The protagonist in the first section of the book, which takes place mostly before WWI and includes Douglas as a character, is a 12-year old boy from the East End of London named Eric. The main character in the second part of the book, which takes place in 1990s England, is a woman named Cherry whose mother served as maid for Elizabeth David for a short while during WWII. Cherry marries John, Eric's grandson, and a London fish shop owner. Cherry sometimes helps John deliver fish, and eventually develops her own catering business. Food associations lead Cherry to discover Elizabeth David and Norman Douglas.  Her discoveries have a profound effect on her life.<br />LUNCH WITH ELIZABETH DAVID is a hauting book about the long-lasting effects of other people's lives.t on her life. <br />LUNCH WITH ELIZABETH DAVID is a hauting book about the long-lasting effects of other people's lives.	2002-11-16

In THE SHAMAN'S BODY, Arnold Mindell suggests how one might find her path of heart, the path of the dreaming body or shaman.  Mindell appears to have spent a good deal of his life to working with patients in comas, and/or near death, and others, and in this book he shares some of the experiences that shaped his &quot;reality&quot; or consciousness. Whether you believe one can be a shaman or not, his story is amazing and a great read.<br />Mindell suggests most people never leave the world of consensus reality--the `ordinary' world. In an age when a plethora of amusements and diversions entertain and/or numb reflective consciousness, the path of heart appears (if it appears at all) as a weird activity at best and downright dangerous at worst. Most folks are terribly unhappy if their world view or version of reality is threatened by conflicting information and so they avoid it where possible.  And yet, as one moves through life beliefs continue to be challenged. As one approaches death, a new reality begins to form. The way of the shaman involves suffering. Most of us try to avoid suffering, but no one succeeds. To be alive is to experience pain. My philosophy is this--if you are going to feel the pain anyway, why not let it work for you?<br />Mindell is a Jungian psychologist, physicist, and process-oriented therapist and teacher working in Portland Oregon. He and his wife Amy have traveled all over the world to met and interact with traditional healers in Africa and Latin America, gurus in India, Zen monks in the far East, and other folks who walk the path of heart. Mindell relates how he found his heart path in Zurich Switzerland where he went to do physics but ended up studying psychology. One afternoon in a caf&eacute;, he casually engaged in a conversation with a fellow customer. After several months of encountering the same fellow at the same caf&eacute; and spending a pleasant afternoon chatting with him, Mindell discovered the man was Jung's grandson and the current head of the Jung Institute. From there Mindell was led to the teachings of Jung, Castenada's Don Juan, and to find his own heart path.<br />Everyone of us has a spirit guide or Ally. Sometimes the guide communicates via an inner voice, as was the case for Joan of Arc. Sometimes another individual enters your life and becomes the voice of the Ally. Sometimes, the Ally visits you in a dream. If you choose to do so, you can find your own heart path.

Read this book and you may never eat a conventionally grown potato again.  I know I won't. If I hadn't been a dedicated organic gardener for over 40 years, I would become one after reading THE BOTANY OF DESIRE. I find it incredibly puzzling that more people haven't bitten the organic bullet. I truly believe a diet of conventionally grown food can shorten your life and bring on all sorts of aches, pains, and illnesses you might not otherwise suffer. Organic gardening works and the stuff you grow is better for you. If you can't grow it, for goodness sakes, hustle on down to your closest Whole Foods store and buy it. Organic food may be more expensive than conventional foods, but in the long run you will save on medical bills.<br />Michael Pollen's book is simply the best set of gardening essays I've read in a long while, maybe ever. And that's saying a lot because I am a big fan of gardening books (I've reviewed over 100 of them for Amazon). I haven't read something so enjoyable since Henry Mitchell's columns and books.  It's not often a book of garden essays can make you laugh (misadventures with Mary Jane), make you cry (one million Irish dead of starvation), make you angry (one million Irish dead), and make you smile (is there any tulip so lovely as `The Queen of the Night?'<br />Pollan covers four plants, Apples, Tulips, Marijuana, and Potatoes. His first chapter on apples, disabused me of all my notions about Johnny Appleseed. I had read Anna Pavord's book THE TULIP, so the tulip section of Pollan's book was the least interesting for me, although he added some interesting anecdotal information.<br />The best section of this book as far as I am concerned is the chapter on Marijuana.  My husband is a substance abuse counselor and I recommended the chapter to him. It could have been titled, \\"Everything you ever wanted to know about Marijuana that they didn't tell you in medical school or criminology class.\\"  If you haven't yet decided the U.S. government officials who devised the war on drugs are nuts, read this chapter and you will become convinced. Drug war indeed!!! Didn't we learn anything with Al Capone??<br />The section on the potato plant is downright scary. Pollan's adventures with Monsanto are illuminating. Once again, the feds come out as the dumb bunnies. Or, maybe it's the elected officials and their appointees who won't let the EPA and USDA do it's job.  The material on evolution in this section nicely complements Steve Jones' DARWIN'S GHOST. Monsanto is in the process of obtaining patents on natural substances and evolutionary processes that will affect the whole food chain-and the CEO says \\"trust me\\".  Yeah, right.<br />Do yourself a favor, during the cold weather ahead. Curl up in an easy chair with a cup of tea and read this book. Whether you garden or not, you will love it.who devised the war on drugs are nuts, read this chapter and you will become convinced. Drug war indeed!!!

Every now and then I read an out-of-print book and wonder why it's out-of-print.  The SILVER WHEEL by Marguerite Elsbeth and Kenneth Johnson is just such a book.  I can't believe the content of SW is so esoteric most women won't understand it. Maybe it didn't get enough publicity when it was released to keep it in print or maybe those \\"really important\\" critics writing for mainstream news organizations ignored it thinking it was some kind of new age arcane book at best or \\"silly\\" feminist stuff at worst. If you read Marion Zimmer Bradley's THE MISTS OF AVALON, or if you're fascinated with Joseph Campbell's works, or if you consider yourself a fan of Jung, or if you are working a 12-step program, or all or none of the above, but are fascinated with the relevance of mythology for our \\"modern\\" age don't miss this book.<br />The authors, provide a test in the early pages (similar to the Myers-Briggs personality test) to help a woman determine her location in the process of finding the self (growing self awareness). Unlike the MB, however (which is often misused), this test does not pigeonhole you into a type, but rather helps you get in touch with your current phase of development.<br />Elsbeth and Johnson present a paradigm consisting of four phases: Queen, Sorceress, Woman Warrior, Lover.  During the course of her lifetime, a woman experiences each of these aspects but not all women experience all aspects in the same order, with one exception, the Sorceress is the final phase. Although she experiences the phases of growth at different times in her life, one facet will be more dominant than the others at each point through life. You can probably work out the order of dominance for your own life. Perhaps you became a Queen (mother), divorced and became a Lover, then became single again and a Warrior Woman who earned her daily bread and protected her kids.<br />The end game of every life is to become the Sorceress (the male equivalent is the Shaman). Sooner or later, you will become a Sorceress because you are going to die. Only the Sorceress, Shamaness, or Saint, is capable of a mystical union with a higher self.<br />The authors make connections between the Celtic world view and the views of Zen Buddists,  American Indians (North and South), the Kabbala, and other Indo-European mystical practices.  The metaphors and myths of the Mabinogion presented by Elsbeth and Johnson can work to heal your life. I found many similarities between SW and ANATOMY OF THE SPIRIT by Caroline Myss, and I liked the SW much better. If you are pursuing the path of healing knowledge, this book can provide you with wonderful insights.you will become a Sorceress because you are going to die.

In her book DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF Joan Mazza explores the meaning of dreams.  Mazza is a psychologist and licensed mental health counselor with a practice involving work with ongoing dream groups. Mazza also leads dream seminars for mental health professionals. To me, Mazza seems like the Dr. Ruth of dreams-incredibly knowledgeable and pragmatic. Her focus seems to be the significance of dreams for individual dreamers, not the neurological underpinnings of synapses. (However, she briefly addresses some ideas on the why of dreams, such as \\"the meaningless random firing of neurons in the brain...\\" and  \\"messages from God, guardian angels, the spirit world, the Higher Self, and the Shadow\\".)<br />If you've been wondering what a particular dream could mean, this book should provide you with a good place to begin exploring the subject. Mazza has written a \\"user-friendly\\" text in which she discusses material she collected from various sources including her own ongoing dream groups. Her approach involves facilitating an interpretation, not providing it. She suggests each dreamer must act as his own interpreter and she provides some tools to do so.<br />Her work has lead her to formulate some ideas about \\"Common Dreams and Themes\\" such as falling, running, being in public with no clothes on, etc. which she includes in a separate section.  I have not experienced every one of the topics she discusses, but have had dreams about being paralyzed, falling, flying, traveling long distances, being terrified by an unknown presence, etc. I found the thematic section most useful as Mazza provides suggestions at the end of each segment in a \\"try this\\" paragraph.<br />Although Mazza finds dreams often appear to have common elements just as often they do not. Even when the dream seems common, the individual dreamer will have his own interpretation. Each of us has unique dreams. As I read Mazza's book, I kept thinking of the narrator in \\"Rebecca\\" who opens with \\"Last night I dreamt again of Manderlay...\\"  I myself had a recurring dream from childhood on, that only became clearer to me as an adult in my forties--and I am still exploring it. The dream may have been a childhood memory or it a memory from a past life. I told my mother every time I had the dream and she would say, oh maybe you are another Bridie Murphy (a reincarnate writer).<br />Maybe, maybe not, but as a result of this and other dreams, exploring the meaning of dreams has become a lifelong habit. On more than one occasion discovering the meaning of a dream has proved incredibly illuminating. I will never forget a dream I had where I was \\"sitting on a fence\\" talking to my ex-boss. This dream helped me to understand my suppressed feelings about my boss. I was literally \\"on the fence\\" where he was concerned.  Meaningless random firings of neurons indeed.

A friend at work recommended the \\"Children of the Earth\\" series to me, and as I respect his opinion and know he is intelligent and would not suggest I read something less than challenging (he has a PhD in Sociology), I figured I would read Jean Auel's first book THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR. The first book in the series was pretty good, but not the best. It was good enough to entice me to find out what happened to Alya, the heroine of the CLAN.<br />VALLEY OF THE HORSES is a much better written book than CLAN. As my friend says, usually, a sequel is not nearly as good as it's predecessor but in this case it definitely is better. The story line in VALLEY is wonderful. I personally believe each of us has a soul mate and I love stories that have this plot element (call me Romantic). I don't think I am giving away much to suggest Ayla has one too. To find out, you have to read this book, or sneak a peak at reviews written about later volumes in the series.<br />Although the story line is great, what I most enjoyed was the amazing historical detail Auel added to her tale. I have been a student of archeology for many years, and as one who has \\"gone out on a dig or two or three\\" I can tell you one of the requisites of successful archeology is a vivid imagination. As one carefully scrapes and brushes away the dirt encasing fragments of aged bones, utensils and other debris, one begins to wonder mightily `What were these people like?' Who once held this pot in her hand? Was she happy when she did so? Did she live a long time or die young? What was her world like? Was it wonderful and frightening at the same time? I have my own vivid imaginings about past lives and don't want them disturbed, only improved upon. Auel succeeds in doing this amazingly well.	2002-10-23

In TAROT SHADOW WORK Christine Jette suggests there are many ways to encounter and deal with the shadow side of the psyche. What is the shadow, and why should one care if the shadow knows or thinks it knows? According to the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung and his onetime associate Sigmund Freud, the persona or face we present to the outside world is not the sum of what we are. Even the conscious thoughts we hide from others are not the sum of a psyche. Much of what transpires throughout the course of a lifetime is hidden from consciousness--repressed, projected, denied, or dealt with via other ego defenses designed to shield one from unpleasant truths.<br />Ever wonder why you form an instant and apparently irrational dislike for someone, or why you scream in rage over the most trivial happening, or why you experience a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach when you hear a certain song or smell a certain perfume? In a more reflective mood and under the right circumstances you can access the unconscious processes that affect these reactions. \\"Tarot Shadow Work\\" is the opposite of analysis-i.e. it is art not science, and as far as I am concerned, the perfect way to approach and use information hiding in the irrational unconscious.<br />Jung suggested the Tarot deck as a way to tap the unconscious. Each of the 22 cards of the Major Arcana corresponds to an archetype, a universal symbol recognized by the unconscious. For example, the Empress represents fertility, motherhood, nurturance. Each of us reacts to those notions differently. If you were nurtured as a child, the Empress might evoke feelings of warmth and contentment. If you are a harried mother with six kids, you might not have the same reaction to the Empress, no matter how much your mother loved you.<br />Each archetype has a light (yang) and dark (yin) side. Jette has developed an assortment of techniques and approaches using the Tarot to facilitate contact with the unconscious and the light (higher self) and dark (shadow self) that lie within. Contact with the unconscious allows one to address grief, anger, and loss that generally underlie unsocial behavior and/or obstruct the individual from becoming all he or she can be. The unconscious can reveal hidden talents, desires, and needs.<br />Jette is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, and much of her text is peppered with information from the Big Book and other 12-step literature as well as the writings of Jung and a variety of new age healers. If you're poised to work a fourth step inventory or using the tenth step on a daily basis, you will find much useful information in TAROT SHADOW WORK.nd dark (shadow self) that lie within.

THE HEALTHY KITCHEN by Andrew Weil and Rosie Daley is a great book with dozens of yummy recipes. I've been looking for good soup and salad recipes, and there are plenty to choose from in this book. A favorite of mine is a salad with \\"Celery, Artichoke, Hearts of Palm and Shrimp.\\" The authors complementary interests and differing approaches to food preparation have produced a text loaded with useful ideas and detail. In addition, the text is colorful, clear and highlighted with many photographs.<br />Weil is a physician, and an advocate of using organic foods wherever possible. He says food produced using conventional methods is generally bad for your health. He lists the most dangerous foods produced using conventional methods including fresh strawberries which can kill you. He suggests that although there was a time when many folks had limited access to organic supplies and/or the funds to buy them, times are changing. Farmers markets and coops are a big help in rural and small town areas. In larger cities, super markets are beginning to carry organic foods. If you haven't shopped organically before now, you may want to give it a try. (The NY Times included a piece on the success of organic gardening on the op-ed page today--10/14/02).<br />Weil suggests some herbs such as parsley should only be used fresh. He has included a segment on herb cultivation (and a lovely photo of his herbs growing on a sunny patio in pots). Daley suggests those without a patio for growing herbs in pots can grow them in a sunny window. In the summer months, I grow herbs as Weil suggests. However, I had a problem keeping fresh herbs on hand during the winter until I discovered specially constructed storage bags that allow vegetables to breathe (GIAM sells them).<br />THE HEALTHY KITCHEN not only includes many tasty recipes for soups and salads, there are a number of sidebars on the various ingredients. The section on herbs is one of them, but there are discussions about \\"Garlic\\",  \\"Shellfish\\",  \\"Fish\\", \\"Meat Substitutes\\",  and \\"Brussel Sprouts for People Who Think They Hate Brussel Sprouts.\\"  I don't like them usually...but the recipe included by Weil and Daley is good enough to eat.

Oh what is a person to do. One the one, hand we are offered diets high in protein that cause weight loss but taken to an extreme (devoid of carbohydrates) can injure the body. On the other hand, we have  DIABETES MEAL PLANNING MADE EASY by Hope S. Warshaw that suggests we overdose on carbohydrates.  In the end, each of us must decide individually which plan works best.<br />I am using the INSULIN RESISTANCE DIET by Hart and Grossman to help me get my life in order, i.e. get my insulin regulated. The \\"weak\\" spells and almost fainting from hunger syndrome I used to have when I ate less protein (as advocated by Warshaw) are gone. On the other hand, I am not on the high protein diet advocated by some. I am losing weight and regaining the spring I used to have in my step (it's easier when you weigh less). When I lay on my side, I have to use a pillow to support my arm since the cutaneous layer around my middle no longer is large enough to serve this purpose.<br />Whereas Ms. Warshaw considers carbohydrates the most important food group (placing them at the bottom of her food pyramid with 6+ servings a day), Hart and Grossman place water at their base with 8+ servings a day. Next come vegetables on both pyramids, but Warshaw links vegetables (3-5 servings) and fruits (2-4 servings), whereas Hart and Grossman show only vegetables (unlimited servings but at least 3 per day).  At the next level, Warshaw shows milk (2-3 servings) and meat, cheese, fish combined (2-3 servings), compared with Hart and Grossman's \\"high protein foods (eight servings a day including 2-5 servings of dairy products). At level 4, in case you've been counting, Warshaw shows fats, sweets, and alcohol with NO servings. Level 4 for Hart and Grossman is high carbohydrate foods with the restriction \\"Eat no more than two servings at any one time. Be sure to eat at least two servings of fruit daily.\\" Fats and oils are the 5th level for Hart and Grossman with the words \\"keep to a minimum\\" and \\"include some good fats in liquid vegetable form.\\"  There is no fifth dimension for Ms. Warshaw's diet.<br />Hart and Grossman say their approach works for diabetics, as well as pre-diabetics and I have found this to be true for me. I am not about to go back on a high carbohydrate diet for anyone, not even the ADA. Maybe, just maybe, the high carbohydrate approach does not work for all women. A key aspect of Hart and Grossman is not only more protein, but a concept they call \\"linking\\" where one never eats a carbohydrate without a protein of greater value. Also, drinking lots of water and limiting carbohydrates to 30 grams per two-hour period is helpful.<br />Hart and Grossman cover research extant at the time they wrote their book (2001) and Warshaw's book reflects the thinking of the ADA extant at the time she published her book (2000). Hart and Grossman have been conducting clinical trials and base their results on their own experiences with clients as well as much scholarly work. The bottom line is if you have diabetes or think you're in the zone, you'll have to do some experimenting. What works for one person may not work for another.

Whether you are just beginning to learn something about herbs and their uses and lore, or are an experienced herbalist, you will enjoy Llewellyn's 2003 HERBAL ALMANAC.  The Almanac consists of a collection of essays covering topics as diverse as Chinese herbal medicine to the origins of Pansies. The book is divided into several broad categories covering the growing and gathering of herbs, culinary herbs, herbs for health, herbs for beauty, herb crafts, and herb history, mystery (myths) and magic.<br />Lest you think you are \\"too old\\" to believe in herbal myths and magic, remember no one really knows why aspirin, cloves, or capsicum work, and while all three ingredients are found in modern medicines, they were first discovered and used by traditional healers. Unfortunately, the synthetic versions of the original herbs (brought to you by the modern petro-chemical pharmaceutical companies) are not as effective as the natural version.<br />Several excellent essays on traditional medicine appear in the ALMANAC.  1) \\"Native American Herbal Healing Ways\\" by Marguerite Elsbeth takes a thought from Chief Joseph, who said, \\"The Earth is our Mother...\\" Elsbeth notes that American Indians believe all life is interrelated. Because of this, poor health comes from spiritual or energy imbalances. American Indian medicine is holistic. The entire body must be considered when illness intervenes. 2) \\"Ashwagandha: India's Superb Tonic\\" by Kevin Spelman, discusses the clinical applications of Ayurvedic herbs as well as Indian (from India) folk medicine used to address ailments ranging from inflamation to bi-polar disorder. 3) \\"Good Health the Chinese Way\\" and \\"Treating Cardiovascular Disease with Traditional Medicine\\" by Xingwu Liu, investigates the wisdom of combining Eastern and Western methods. Whereas the West has progressed technologically, the East has retained the wisdom of the ages.  Perhaps the time has come to link MRI equipment with a holistic approach. Although Liu is not so bold, I might add, perhaps if one practices a holistic approach, the equipment will never be needed.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and heart who is ready to accept great wisdom.bold, I might add, perhaps if one practices a holistic approach, the equipment will never be needed. <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and heart who is ready to accept great wisdom.	2002-10-06

The American Diabetes Association DIABETES COOKBOOK is a thin volume with a few tasty recipes and many more that don't particularly appeal to me as I seldom eat pasta, rice, or polenta. Unlike some other \\"recipe\\" books I've encountered recently, every page of the ADA cookbook is printed in bright colors and on glossy paper. You can salivate to your heart's content over the photographs of the prepared dishes on every other page. Whether you can duplicate the look of these prepared dishes depends on your cooking skills. Whether you will like them depends on your taste. The recipes include an assortment of ways to combine spices and vegetables, so if your vegetable menu is growing stale you might find a goodie or two here.<br />I found a few good recipes including one for \\"Spicy Lentil Soup' that includes grated fresh ginger and canned coconut milk.  However, a serving contains 6 grams of protein and 22 grams of carbohydrates, and 3 grams of fat, so I use powdered milk to reduce the carbohydrate count and up the protein count. Of course it tastes a bit different, but since I never put milk of any sort in my lentils before I still found an interesting way to make a change. I love eggplant and the recipe for \\"Eggplant Parmigiana\\" using eggplant, tomatoes and fresh herbs is quite good--and a good Italian dish without pasta and thus low in carbohydrates.<br />Why scale back the carbohydrates? Well, I am using THE INSULIN-RESISTANCE DIET by Hart and Grossman, and these authors recommend consuming fewer carbohydrates (not eliminating them, just reducing them). Since I am feeling better and actually beginning to drop a few pounds, it seems the lower carbohydrate approach works for me. Books on diabetes and insulin resistance differ, so in the end you will probably have to experiment to see what works for you.	2002-10-05

Diabetes is a family disease, and all six siblings on my dad's side, including my dad, have been (or were before they died) diagnosed with Diabetes. As I watch my aunts and other members of our family cope or fail to cope with this disease, and my husband and I deal with symptoms of \\"insulin-resistance\\" I am taking steps to tackle the problem head on. Part of this effort is learning more about diet and putting what I learn into practice. I recently read, and am using THE INSULIN-RESISTANCE DIET, by Hart and Grossman and find it very helpful. I bought THE JOSLIN DIABETES QUICK AND EASY COOKBOOK with the hope of finding more information that would fit the scheme outlined by Hart and Grossman. I find Frances Giedt's book very useful, however, many of her recipes contain higher levels of carbohydrates than I am allowed with the insulin-resistance diet. In some instances I can make substitutions.<br />Good features of Giedt's book include - 1) recipes for 2 servings, a brilliant idea since Type II diabetes attacks older folks in greater numbers and the average household size for householders over 50 is less than two. I find dividing a recipe for six can be annoying. It's much easier to double or triple the recipe if you want extra servings for freezing. 2) a pantry list at the front of her book which allows one to assess current stocks. As many recipes call for the same items, and it's nice to have a \\"core\\" list. 3) a discussion of storage arrangements. Smaller households find big ingredients a hassle. (Giedt does not mention this, but Giam sells special storage bags and \\"keeper\\" disks for the refrigerator vegetable drawer, and they  work well.) 4) calorie counts, content measures for protein, carbohydrates, fat, etc. and \\"Joslin\\" exchanges are listed beside each recipe. (The latter explained in an appendix.) 5) good ideas such as preparing a beef onion mix that can be frozen and used as an ingredient when a single bowl of Chili or some other meal that includes cooked and crumbled beef is desired.<br />For me, the annoying aspects of this book are these - 1) Although the recipes are low calorie, many of them are high carbohydrate. 2) While the book is loaded with gems of information, the reader will have to extract them. For example, I had to read through a number of recipes before I found the egg = egg substitute equivalencies. As many of the recipes call for eggs or egg substitute, it would have been good if she had included this information in an index. (If she did, I can't find it!!) Neither of these complaints are a &quot;big deal&quot; however, hence the 5 stars.and crumbled beef is desired. <br />For me, the annoying aspects of this book are these - 1) Although the recipes are low calorie, many of them are high carbohydrate. 2) While the book is loaded with gems of information, the reader will have to extract them.

Well, I must really be dumb, because the DIABETES COOKBOOK FOR DUMMIES is really loaded with information and very overwhelming. Don't get me wrong, the book is filled with good stuff if you are trying to gain weight, I just think the title is misleading. They should have called it \\"the encyclopedia of diabetes recipes, meals, menus, hints, trivia, and everything else prepared by someone who knows what you really want to eat\\" or something like that. I did find dozens of good recipes in this book. I am using THE INSULIN RESISTANCE DIET by Hart and Grossman and the DUMMIES cookbook is loaded with plenty of recipes I can adapt, and some not so adaptable. .<br />For example, the book includes a really smashing recipe for \\"Chicken salad with Gorgonzola mayonnaise and walnuts\\".  As lush as it sounds, the nutrient content of a single serving is a mere 408 calories, with 37 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, and 25 grams of fat.  The book lists the exchanges as 5 lean meat, 1 vegetable, and 3 fat.  Okay, I know I will have to eat a half a portion-which leads me to a complaint-the recipe is for 6 servings. Since the endive won't freeze, maybe this recipe is for 6-8 thin friends??<br />Another good recipe for six is \\"Basil and onion soup.\\"  Here a serving = a mere 121 calories and is therefore a bit more useful for my purposes. However, the nutrient value is 3.5 grams of protein, 8 grams of carbohydrates, and 9 grams of fat. Oh darn, must be that ½ cup of \\"light\\" whipping cream!! Are they nuts?? I guess dummies are REALLY dumb.	2002-10-05

When friends and relatives and acquaintances gathered together Sept. 10, 1992 to memorialize Elizabeth David, they shared bottles of Macon Prisse 1991 and Morgan Chateau Gaillard 1991, as well as conversation. Artemis Cooper, author of `WRITING AT THE KITCHEN TABLE: THE AUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY OF ELIZABETH DAVID suggests David would have approved. In the space of several decades, David had revolutionized cooking and meal preparation in Britain and introduced the British to really fine wines. Like her counterpart in America-Julia Child-David had no idea she would cause such a stir when she began to write articles about French, Italian, and other Mediterranean cuisines after WWII. David's notion that one could cook and eat other people's food-a multiethnic moment if there ever was one-was downright avant garde in the 1950s.<br />Cooper covers David's (nee Elizabeth Gwynne) life from her early days on the family estate in Wales, through WWII when she worked for the British in Egypt, to her amazing career as an author of books on food and food preparation. Before, during, and after WWI, David lived in Italy, the Levant, Egypt, and India where she learned how to make many local dishes and to appreciate \\"home grown\\" foods we call organic today. When Ms. David began to write about her dishes on her kitchen table, rationing was in still in force in Britain. Nevertheless, her first book on French country cooking was a hit. She then went on to write a number of books and many articles focused on what various people grow, cook, and eat.<br />Elizabeth David certainly lived in interesting times. A most intriguing aspect of Cooper's biography is her skillful placement of David within her age, a period during which the social mores of the UK changed somewhat dramatically. David had many interesting friends, including the writers Lawrence Durrell and Norman Douglas. Her book agent was Paul Scott, author of the RAJ QUARTET, and Olivia Manning, who wrote the Balkan and Levant trilogies known collectively as THE FORTUNES OF WAR was a friend from her days in Egypt.

Aside from the negative message of it's title, BE A LOSER by Greer Childers has exactly three pages of useful information. Otherwise, (in my opinion) Childers' book is an uninformed collection of warmed over opinions about diet and exercise.<br />Do you breathe deeply? If not, you need to start doing so. Oxygen is a valuable element, and given the problems with the atmosphere (i.e. pollution) the ratio of oxygen molecules to other matter and gases is much lower than it used to be. This means you need to take more and bigger breaths and do it often.<br />Childers has a 15-minute workout that helps you develop better breathing habits. I bought the book because a friend in my office in her 50s has become very thin, and when I asked her how she did it, she recommended Childers book. After I bought the book, I discovered my friend was also following the Atkins diet. I suspect her weight loss is not entirely connected to Childers' breathing exercises.<br />Still, breathing is a good thing, and I did not do enough of it. Probably as a result of working in a relatively stressful environment, I had developed the strange habit of taking shallow breaths-a weird sort of panting. Since I have been doing Childers' breathing exercise each a.m. (and continuing to do my other exercises, such as sit-ups) I have noticed I am not as likely to become winded walking up the three flights of stairs at work. I am also using THE INSULIN-RESISTANCE DIET by Hart and Grossman and gradually getting more fit.  One note, Childers says her methods may not work for those on thyroid medication, birth control, antidepressants, or with extremely low metabolism.	2002-09-28

THE INSULIN-RESISTANCE DIET was written by Cheryle Hart, a medical doctor trained at the Mayo clinic, and Mary Kay Grossman, a Registered Dietician. The authors bring the most-up-to-date research into the discussion of how to lose weight and keep it off. Their theory resonates with me. My experience has shown me that simply eating less (especially fat) and exercising don't make a difference. When I was younger, I used to be able to keep weight off with ease. When I reached my fifties, the going got harder. I eat much less today than ever. I don't drink alcohol or soft drinks. I don't eat desserts. I seldom eat bread, and when I do it's usually multi grain. I eat lots of fish and chicken, yogurt and cottage cheese, vegetables and fruits. I exercise moderately by walking, climbing stairs, parking far from the door. I do stretches every day (sit-ups, etc.).<br />I've started the insulin diet because it makes sense. Basically, I eat about the same things I have been eating, but do it differently. The authors show you how to \\"link\\" foods so that the compliment each other and induce the body to make less insulin. Insulin is the hormone our ancestors needed to deal with the starving times. Today, most of us aren't starving most of the time, so insulin actually becomes dysfunctional. The authors explain the process--how our bodies manufacture too much insulin in response to the foods we eat and when we eat them--and how it can lead to Type II Diabetes. Then they explain how you can change the pattern and be healthier--and slimmer.<br />Carbohydrates can be a problem, but you should not give them up. The authors suggest carbo-depriving can make you unhealthy. Diets overly reliant on protein can cause kidney damage. Balancing what you eat is the key. Our ancestors did not eat steak everyday. Survival and reproduction required some protein and fat, but most likely they ate lots of plants and fruits. But this information isn't new. The USDA has been saying for years  we should eat vegetables, fruits, protein, and some fats and complex carbohydrates. Grossman and Hart suggest the way you combine these foods can actually help you lose weight and keep it off.<br />The book contains food lists, recipes, and meals. Also included are lists of items you can order from your favorite fast food joint.

Somewhere in one of my many boxes of books I have a copy of a reprint of the original book by Celia Thaxter, &quot;An Island Garden&quot;. I have written a review about this book for Amazon elsewhere, and said it wasn't very good (it isn't) and received many negative votes. My major complaint about the &quot;other&quot; book is that you cannot see the brush strokes in the paintings. The book obviously appeals to those who care not a whit about brush strokes.<br />Fans of Child Hassam--this is the book you want. No, it isn't the cute little book by Thaxter. The reproductions of Childe Hassam's paintings of Celia Thaxter's island in CHILD HASSAM: AN ISLAND GARDEN REVISITED are 100 times better--and you can see the brush strokes. I can't give this book five stars, because I collect art books know the reproductions could have been better. However, the reproductions in this book are head and shoulders above those in Thaxter's book.  Not only that, David Curry has included much text about life on Thaxer's island and in her famous parlor.<br />If you are a fan of the American Impressionist Childe Hassam, you will appreciate knowing something about the artist, his work, his friends, and his relationship with Ms. Thaxter. Most of all, you will be able to see what he painted and get an idea of where you might locate some of the originals. They are still hanging in various places such as the Walter's Gallery in Baltimore and other esoteric locations.	2002-09-22

In THE OLD RELIGION IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM: WICCA, Vivianne Crowley suggests Wicca is the religion of the Age of Aquarius. She says religions of the book, concerned with the sacrifice of the self, were dominant during the Age of Pisces (symbolized by the fish). Wicca, concerned with the search for the Self, is the religion of the new millennium. \\"Religion must evolve to meet the needs of the developing human psyche.\\" In the new millennium, the developing human psyche is faced with the task of integration or what Jung referred to as the process of individuation.<br />Crowley's writing is forthright, honest, clear and helpful.  She combines material from many sources, including the writings of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell, and presents an in-depth portrait of the ancient Goddess focused religion. She says Wicca is balanced. Unlike many religions, including those of the book (Christianity, Islam) or Zen Buddhism, Wicca along with Hinduism, recognizes the balance between the light and the dark, humanity and nature, male and female. Wicca is not an evangelical religion. Those called to Wicca respond to the silver harp-whisper of the Goddess and the horn of the Hunter. Wicca is based on attraction, not promotion.<br />In the early sections of her book, Crowley describes the history of Paganism and Wicca (all Wiccans are Pagan, but not all Pagans are Wiccan). She says Wicca is an ancient religion whose name refers to the accumulation of wisdom. She suggests much Wiccan material was handed along by \\"hiding\\" it in plain sight within the liturgical practices and doctrinal writings of dominant religions. She refers to the Tarot, the Kabbala, and works of literature.<br />Wiccan knowledge was amassed over thousands of years. Some rituals date from the Paleolithic. Some rituals have been preserved as part of another religion. Some material has been preserved by Masons, Rosicrucians, and others. Wiccan archetypes are found in many religions. For example, the mother and father archetypes have been incorporated in many rituals and given many names. Crowley provides a brief overview of various myths from the Levant, India, and Southern and Northern Europe that tell about the Queen of Heaven and the Lord of the Underworld.<br />Much of the ritual material about witchcraft including the stages of initiation can be found elsewhere (Farrar or Buckland for example), but if you are unfamiliar with this material Crowley's book is a good resource. I found Crowley's synthesis Jung's thinking and the teachings of Wicca most illuminating and original. I have felt for many years Jung is the prophet of the New Age and once again Crowley reaffirms it. Some people know Jung had a profound affect on AA and other 12-step programs, that his thoughts are reflected in the writing of Joseph Campbell, and that his archetypes underlie the Myers-Briggs personality tests, but I venture to say, not many knew his thinking could be connected to Wicca.rchetypes have been incorporated in many rituals and given many names.

LITTLE HERB GARDENS is a great book for the novice. The authors have assembled a lovely collection of photographs and interspersed them with succinct text that explains how to identify and select easy to grow herbs; when and where to buy them (spring, fall, summer, nurseries or catalogs, plants or seeds); how to pot them (containers, soil, etc.); and where to place them (balconies, patios, or in small gardens).<br />This little book will inspire you to create a green space in a kitchen window, an assemblage before a patio or balcony door, or a collection of pots on the balcony. Herbs grow best in full sunlight, so if your balcony faces south, you are in luck. If you live in a town house or have a small patch of ground you can think more expansively, but this book does not really deal with garden design, or the issues associated with herb gardening. Herbs are frequently garden thugs that run amuck in the open. I suggest you find a more in-depth book such as RODALE'S ILLUSTRATED ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HERBS if you intend to go beyond pots and are thinking of growing mints, yarrows, violets, or some of the other \\"easy\\" to grow herbs suggested by this book. RODALE'S book also covers the poisonous aspects of herbs. (Some of them can kill you.)<br />The last section of LITTLE HERB GARDENS briefly covers kitchen uses of herbs including making herb-infused vinegars and herb-flavored sorbets. If you want to know more, once again you will have to turn to something more comprehensive such as THE COMPLETE BOOK OF HERBS by Lesley Bremness. Even if you can't grow herbs, you can buy them at the farmer's market and some food stores. LITTLE HERB GARDENS is not the only book available for learning how to grow herbs or use them, but it will get you started.	2002-09-19

ACID ROW by Minette Walters is a fast-paced but dreary novel sans character development, a vexing deficiency for one who prefers the psychological aspects of crime which can only be presented from a personal perspective. Walters strength in her earlier novels, including THE ICE HOUSE and THE SCULPTRESS, lay in her ability to portray the thought processes of the main characters with a good deal of verisimilitude, even while hiding pertinent information in plain sight. In addition, her historical focus in other books has allowed me to understand the careful reconstruction of events by a main protagonist.<br />Walters' narrative in ACID ROW rotates among three \\"protagonists\\" - a female doctor named Sophie, an ex-con called Jimmy, and Inspector Tyler of the police.  None of these \\"main\\" characters is adequately developed, although Walters provides a good deal of superfluous information about each of them. All of them talk too much, particularly the female doctor. In addition to the poorly developed main players, Walters has included a cast of secondary and tertiary characters who only add to the diffuseness of the narrative. In the end, I found that I did not care what happened to a single one of the characters.<br />The two story lines-one involving the disappearance of a 10-year old child, the other a neighborhood mob reaction to a newly resident sex-offender ex-con-have some tangential connections.  Both involve too many perverts of one sort or another, and Walters spends far too much time \\"making excuses\\" for their demented behavior. One clue to Walter's obtuseness on the subject of sexual predators is voiced by a character who suggests teen age pregnancies are the result of young female seducers. Excuse me??  Research shows that most teenage girls become pregnant by a much older man.  Too frequently, the male is a relative.  Get real Walters. Save your sympathy for the real victims.	2002-09-19

THE NEW HERB BIBLE was written by a garden designer, a beautician, and an osteopath/naturopath.  The authors provide a much useful information about the major herbs used in cooking, cosmetics, and healing.  Some of the material is quite good, but there are omissions and discrepancies the novice will not catch. The book is filled with many lovely photographs, a must for best selling gardening books these days, but not always an indicator the text is the most comprehensive, accurate, or current.<br />The \\"gardening\\" section of the book covers herbs that do well around London, but many of them may do better or worse in the States.  For example, England sits on a nice chalk base and English Lavender does quite well along walkways. In the hot, humid, and acid soil found in many parts of the states, Lavender rots (does well in the Great Valley of Virginia which sits on a limestone bed!!).  The authors suggest that the blue Cranesbill Geranium `Johnston's Blue' and the Lady's Mantle Alchemilla Mollis will bloom all summer, but they won't south of the Mason-Dixon line or in most of the west beyond the Mississippi. These plants bloom in the spring in the Upper South, and then they fry. Experienced gardeners know that certain roses do well in London, but others do well in the States.<br />The \\"cosmetic\\" section of this book is fun, and probably the best reason to buy it.  However, making cosmetics is work, and if you have Fresh Fields next door, you may prefer to buy herbal cosmetics-I do. However, if you feel adventuresome, you too can make mint eye lotion and rose and basil perfume, provided you are able to grow the roses that produce the attar you need for the latter. You won't have any trouble at all growing the mint.<br />The \\"medicinal\\" section of this book is interesting, but I prefer Penelope Ody's COMPLETE BOOK OF MEDICINAL HERBS (she's English) or THE GARDEN PHARMACY by James Duke (retired from the USDA). RODALE'S ILLUSTRATED ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HERBS is also a good bet (organic). You will probably want to own more than one book on the subject of medicinal herbs since some herbs can kill if they are misapplied.  As the medicinal use of herbs is a tricky subject, I believe in a little cross-referencing. For example, the verdict is still out on Ginko, an \\"herb\\" recommended by this book (with caution). THE NEW HERB BIBLE mentions recent drug trials where possible, as does Dr. Duke and the RODALE book. Even when you are fully informed by books, a little trial and error will be required as all of us have different constitutions.<br />THE NEW HERB BIBLE is a useful survey work, but probably more useful for those living in England (5 stars) than the States (3 stars).bet (organic).

According to legend, the mortally wounded Crusader troubadour Tancredi fell across a white rose bush. As he lay dying, he begged his comrade Orlando, to take one of the blood-stained roses to his love Vulcana in the city of Venice. When she saw the rose, Vulcana became very pale and could not speak. The next morning she was found dead holding the blood-stained rose in her hand. On April 25, St. Mark's Day, traditional Venetian men give their belles a red rose in commemoration of the lover's tragedy. The best roses are made with Venetian glass beads.<br />In THE FLOWERS OF VENICE, Giovanna Poggi Marchesi shows the reader how to make Vulcana's rose as well as many other beautiful flowers from glass beads.  These flowers can be used in bouquets and floral arrangements, as decorative elements on Easter Eggs, lampshades, trinket boxes, candle holders, mirror frames, and in numerous other ways. The only constraint seems to be one's imagination.<br />Marchesi provides the reader with step by step written instructions for making the flowers, as well as photographs of completed phases of the process. Although she uses beads manufactured in and around Venice, her book lists both Venetian and other bead suppliers, as well as resources such as magazines dedicated to the craft of glass bead flower making.<br />The glass blowers of Venice create superior beads from the same materials used to make Murano glass. First, the moltan glass is prepared. Then it is blown and stretched into long thin canes of hollow tubing to be cut and sized for various purposes.<br />Traditionally, Venetian glass beads were strung on iron rods of various weights and then the pliable rods were twisted into the requisite shapes. Although Marchesi uses the traditional iron rods, her book includes suggestions for other kinds of rods including various types of craft wire that can be found in hobby shops.<br />Marchesi suggests that a good deal of work goes into flower making, so one should use or buy the best materials, and care for the flowers. Glass flowers need to be cleaned periodically, a risky business as the flower stems are covered with silk and/or other fragile materials and the iron rods can rust. Marchesi shows the reader how to submerge the flowers in soapy water and rinse and dry them in the sun. She also includes photographs showing how to &quot;dry&quot; clean them with alcohol.<br /><br />Whether or not you intend to make glass-bead flowers or buy them ready-made in Venice, this wonderful book is an invaluable resource.best materials, and care for the flowers.

For ages, the contemporary writings of the Venerable Bede, an early Christian churchman, have served as a mainstay for historians attempting to understand 7th Century Britain. Bede was probably Saxon descent, or an Angle as he preferred to call the Germanic invaders of Britain. By the time Bede lived and wrote, the Saxons (Germanic peoples from what is today northern Germany, Holland and Denmark) had established power in Britain, albeit fractured by warring factions. Apparently, the first Saxons had been imported by the Romans to serve as mercenary soldiers and secure Britannia from non-Roman invaders.  After official Rome withdrew formal support in the 5th Century, the remaining Romano-British people and Saxon soldiers joined forces.  Following waves of invasion from the Germanic areas of Europe, by the 7th Century, Saxons ruled most of Britain.<br />Higham argues Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum or Ecclesiastical History of the English People is a biased accounting of his times. Bede serves as both apologist and historian for the Saxon invaders, portraying them as a \\"chosen people\\" who brought the word of God to the heathen. Never mind that many of the Romano-Britains were probably already Christian. One of Bede's complaints is that the Britains do not reckon Easter using the \\"Roman\\" method.<br />Using the writings of Bede and other contemporaneous material such as the `Tribal Hidage', a tribute list thought to reflect the kingship structure of the period, Higham constructs a population profile. By the 7th Century, the Britains had become mostly rural farmers and slaves or servants, who lived and worked on landed estates controlled by Saxon overlords. Higham deduces their status as much from what Bede says as what he doesn't say. He deconstructs Bede's text, examining his use of various terms such as `pagan' and  `imperium', the latter a word used by Bede to equate Saxon rule with that of the Romans.<br />Several things I like about this book include: 1) Higham's ideas concerning the identity of the great warrior buried at Sutton Hoo; 2) His links to Beowulf ; 3) His investigation of the use of various Latin, British, and German (Angles=English) terms in different contexts; 4) His view of how the Britains moved from Roman domination to Anglo-Saxon serfdom.ude: 1) Higham's ideas concerning the identity of the great warrior buried at Sutton Hoo; 2) His links to Beowulf ; 3) His investigation of the use of various Latin, British, and German (Angles=English) terms in different contexts; 4) His view of how the Britains moved from Roman domination to Anglo-Saxon serfdom.	2002-09-11

Beth Chatto's GARDEN NOTEBOOK is a delightful and instructive read for advanced gardeners, nursery folks, landscape designers, and/or horticulture majors. Thomas Fischer, Executive Editor of Horticulture Magazine updated the Latin nomenclature for the 1998 edition. Amateur or new gardeners will probably enjoy the book, even if they stumble over many of the plant names. Chatto includes many interesting personal notes about herself, her family, and other folks-including the odd visitor to the nursery.<br />Chatto operates the Nursery for Unusual Plants at Elmstead Market, Essex, England. At the time she wrote her book she had been awarded the Royal Horticulture Society's Victoria Medal and had won many gold meadows at the annual Chelsea Flower Show (the largest in the world) held every May in London. Folks who have seen the film GREEN FINGERS with Clive Owen and Helen Mirran can appreciate the work involved with an exhibition at Chelsea.<br />GARDEN NOTEBOOK was based on Chatto's observations and activities over the course of one calendar year in the 1980s. Sooner or later, every garden writer uses the annual cycle as an organizing principle, but Chatto's book is quite original. Unlike many writers for whom gardening is a hobby, Chatto is the consummate professional nursery gardener-one who gardens herself and maintains stocks and seeds for others. Over the course of a year, she manages her nursery and prepares for her entry in the Chelsea flower show. She says she begins to think about the next show as far as a year ahead. Many plants must be prepared for a climax showing on a particular date, and as anyone who gardens knows timing is everything. Temperatures, light, and many other factors affect outcomes. Chatto uses all sorts of tricks to speed up and slow down the development of the plants she intends to show in May.<br />I enjoyed Chatto's narrative about the \\"running of a nursery for unusual plants\\" more than her discussion about the prep work for Chelsea, meeting the Queen, or visits by illustrious people like Elizabeth David (for whom Chatto prepared lunch and shares her menu and recipes with the reader). Nursery owners (not to be confused with the managers of solely profit-based garden center factories carrying only best-selling lines) have quite a challenge. In addition to the many ordinary tasks any gardener faces, the nursery owner must stay abreast of current developments in the seed and plant world; determine the suitability of various plants for the area served; train staff to recognize plants and learn about their proper care and feeding; as well as a miscellany of other chores. Chatto has been able to operate what is clearly a successful enterprise; participate in a seed bank; work for the preservation of endangered plant species; write several books; and enter Chelsea year after year and win medals. She says she is very reliant on her staff, but it takes talent to train and retain a good staff. She also maintains good connections with other nursery folks around the world. She deserves her medals for Chelsea and more.  If you enjoy this book, I also recommend A YEAR IN OUR GARDENS by Nancy Goodwin and Allen Lacy.eting the Queen, or visits by illustrious people like Elizabeth David (for whom Chatto prepared lunch and shares her menu and recipes with the reader).

Every now and then I read a challenging book that leaves me exhausted, awe inspired, and somewhat sad. Such is DARWIN'S GHOST: THE ORIGIN OF THE SPECIES UPDATED by the English geneticist Steve Jones. Apparently, Jones has the reputation of being one who can distill, combine, and convey complex scientific findings and conclusions to a lay audience. Although it seems to have been relatively well received, I suspect only a limited number of people will actually read this book from cover to cover as I did.<br />GHOST is not \\"pop\\" science. Nor is it a scientific text. It is a jam-packed overview of a complex topic and a book someone contemplating a career in biology should read. Jones includes no copious footnotes and very few citations, although he does provide the reader with sources for further research. While I think he covers most areas superficially, he includes more than enough for the educated lay person. Taking a page from Darwin's books \\"The Origin of the Species\\" and \\"The Descent of Man\\", he says the natural world has evolved and is still evolving, and humans have evolved and are still evolving. Going beyond Darwin, Jones notes that a good deal of the biodiversity Darwin described following the voyage of the Beagle has disappeared. Jones suggests humans have done a great deal in a short while to destroy the natural world.<br />Evolution does not follow the trajectory some have imagined-from simple to complex (progress). It is not straightforward. It is messy. Sometimes it is retro. Jones compares evolution to the banyan tree whose branches drop down to the ground, grow roots, and ascend as a new trunk. Punctuated equilibrium is a phrase used by some scientists to describe the evolution of a single species. Species change in response to a stimulus. When the stimulus disappears or is addressed via adaptation (or extinction), equilibrium resumes (i.e. the creature is no more or it goes about it's business). Jones provides many examples of stressful evolutionary change including the story  of the island of Krakatau east of Java which exploded in the late 19th Century destroying all life with the exception of a single spider. Today, the island is relatively stable and is somewhat repopulated, but it's diversity has been diminished. Another example of change is the spread of the zebra mussel over most of the open waterways in the world-owing to shipping.<br />Jones says humans like to order everything into categories of understanding. Unfortunately, most  classification systems are faulty when it comes to ordering the natural world. For example, using morphology as the basis for classifying creatures has it's limits. Some folks once classified certain mammals as fish because they swam in water. Others thought pandas were bears and alligators and crocodiles were closely related.  Comparative anatomy and it's successor DNA sequencing suggest pandas are closer to racoons and alligators are closer to birds.<br />Genealogy (the fossil record and DNA sequencing) provides strong evidence for evolution-or change over time. No other paradigm fits the empirical evidence. How evolution occurs is open to discussion.  Jones describes what he believes has transpired. His discussion covers many things from AIDS research to zebra mussels.<br />If you are interested in the environment and species diversity-and/or planning a trip to the Galapagos Islands or Hawaii-and/or thinking of taking up biology as a career--you will find this book instructive.ry change including the story  of the island of Krakatau east of Java which exploded in the late 19th Century destroying all life with the exception of a single spider.

WITCHCRAFT AND MAGIC IN EUROPE: BIBLICAL AND PAGAN SOCIETIES, edited by Bengt Ankarloo and Stuart Clark is the first in a six-volume series of scholarly essays on the subject of magic and witchcraft in Europe from the Iron Age through modern times. I have read five of the six books, and  found them to be very scholarly, extremely interesting, and best of all-objective. The last book in the series, Volume 4. \\"The Period of the Witch Trials\\" (known as the \\"burning times\\" in 15th Century Europe), is scheduled to be published in late 2002. The historians, linguists, archeologists, and other social scientists who worked on these volumes are academics and experts in their subject areas.<br />Volume I contains two essays, \\"Witchcraft and Magic in Ancient Mesopotamia\\" by Marie-Louise Thomsen and \\"Magic in Ancient Syria-Palestine and in the Old Testament.&quot; Thomsen's essay examines and comments on literary and other material found in archeological digs in Mesopotamia. Treasures unearthed in what is today modern Iraq speak of lost empires (Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian) and wonders of the ancient world such as the White Ziggurat and the Hanging Gardens. Mesopotamia (the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers where the Moon God Sin and the Goddess Inanna ruled) has produced numerous ancient cuneiform writing tablets which describe the power of precious stones, amulets for the protection of babies, love charms, potency incantations, and a variety of other practices for dealing with ghosts, evil portents, healing and the removal of curses. The work of Babylonian astrologer/astronomers still amaze.<br />Cryer's work tackles the notion of the Bible as \\"truth\\" head on. He sets about constructing the story of magic in ancient Israel and Judah (Syria-Palestine) using archeological evidence and other extra-biblical material, as well as the Bible. He says the Old Testament is an \\"anno mundi\\" chronology that takes the moment of creation as it's starting point. However, \\"the Biblical anno mundi chronology is badly out of synchronization with world history.\\" Cryer argues extra-Biblical material cannot be used merely to \\"illustrate\\" Bible text, i.e. the Bible should not be treated as a privileged source by scholars but must be subjected to the same scrutiny and analysis as other historical documents. For example, \\"All indications are that the territorial states of Israel and Judah existed....\\"  However, the archeological record does not support the stories of Moses and the wandering of the Jews in the wilderness following 400 years in Egypt.<br />Cryer suggests the Durkheimian distinction between the religion of the group and the magic of the individual may be misleading. He says Jewish priests of the Old Testament practiced magic as part of their religion, but their magic was not very different from that of non-Jewish \\"sorcerers\\" or magicians they condemned. Cryer provides numerous examples from Biblical text that reveal magical thinking/action, and he compares them with similar thinking in texts from Mesopotamia. He suggests that it comes down to this-the magic others do is evil while the magic sanctioned by your group is religion. He says the Old Testament priests condemned astrology because they did not know how to do it.<br />Regarding the magical practice of &quot;casting lots&quot; to predict an outcome, Cryer suggests the magi/priest knew it would work on average, but could not explain why. Casting lots is not very different from what modern statisticians do when they conduct an exit poll in an election. Even today, no one can explain WHY probability works (ask any mathematician).

In the last part of ANATOMY OF THE SPIRIT, Caroline Myss unites her discussion of three belief systems (Roman Catholic Sacraments, Kabbalah Tree of Life, and Hindu Chakras) within the concept of living in the present moment. Many who have trod the spiritual path Myss describes and faced the Three Big Crises - absence of meaning and purpose; strange new fears; and devotion to something greater than one's self - will appreciate her final words. Suffering produces spiritual rewards.<br />Not everyone will appreciate Myss' book. I would like to send the audio version to my 87-year old aunt who is devoutly Roman Catholic, but I don't think she would like it. My Southern Baptist aunt would probably disown me. My daughter would appreciate it - but she's a fan of Bishop Pike. For a change, Myss has written a book older folks will appreciate more than younger ones.<br />I know something about the sacraments having been raised with them. I've also acquired a great deal of knowledge about the Chakras in the past 40 years (via reading and Hindu friends). I have studied the Kabbalah (it is far more complex than Myss' book indicates). Like Joseph Campbell whom she apparently see as a model, Myss sees a larger truth underlying religious structures and/or tribal systems of belief.<br />Myss is billed as an expert on energy medicine. In the early 1980s, I had the pleasure and privilege of being in Louis Hay's home. I can testify that \\"whatever your mind can conceive and believe it will achieve.\\" Whenever I have an ailment, I whip out Hays' healing books (Myss cites one of them). Healing takes many forms. Doctors mostly facilitate the process or mess it up. The power of positive thinking, prayer, the laying on of hands, and laughter all work to heal the body-mind-spirit. What Myss shares is not new, but if you haven't heard about it elsewhere you can learn more here.<br />This is a good book. I've heard, read, and/or experienced most of what Myss describes so I can testify to the truthfulness of it.

Many `experts' have attempted to interpret the Paleolithic images and forms found in underground passages and caves such as Lascaux, Altamira, and Chauvet. Known as Franco-Cantabrian, because 95 percent of cave art in the world lies in Southern France or the Iberian Peninsula, these works rank among the most mysterious. What were the artists thinking??<br />In THE SHAMANS OF PREHISTORY, Jean Clottes and David Lewis-Williams put forth their interpretation of the meaning of Paleolithic cave art. Clottes is currently investigating Chauvet and Lewis Williams is a professor of cognitive archeology affiliated with the University of Whitwatersrand in South Africa.<br /><br />During the last Ice Age, Paleolithic humans gathered in the warmer parts of the European continent in what is today southern France and northern Portugal and Spain, along with large numbers of animals including horses, bison, deer, aurochs, and others. For some reason, these humans felt compelled to depict some of these animals in \\"parietal\\" or cave art. The discovery of this art has launched much speculation.<br />Early on, experts suggested that the cave art was \\"art for art's sake\\" (posited by anti-church scientists who could not accept any religious connection). Most recently, experts in Structuralism have suggested binary patterns underlie the meaning of the art, but these patterns are so general as to be unhelpful.<br />The most persistent interpretation of the art during the past 100 years has been that it was created in conjunction with sympathetic magic rituals used to increase the size of herds of animals hunters stalked. But this interpretation has many flaws. For one thing, the area surrounding the caves was brimming with game at the time the art was created. For another, many of the animals consumed by Paleolithic humans were not depicted (fish, birds, boars, for example). For another, horses outnumber other beasts pictured, and although they were sometimes consumed by humans, the bones left behind in various camp sites indicate horses were not at the top of the menu. Other problems with the \\"hunter\\" interpretation lie in the actual depiction of the animals-spears and arrows are often placed at odd angles for killing; animals are placed at odd angles for living or dying; animals appear to be more alive than dead; pregnant females are seldom shown--and last but not least, some of the animals are predators themselves. Naturalists that they were, Paleolithic folks certainly understood the source of baby animals and they certainly would not have wished to increase the numbers of their competitors.<br />Clottes and Lewis-Williams propose another interpretation of the cave art -- Shamanism. The term Shaman is taken from the Siberian word Tungus-the name of one who goes into a trance and has visions. All humans are capable of entering a trance or &quot;altered state&quot; and cultures around the world exhibit variations of Shamanism -- including many orthodox Western religions. Some enter a trance via drugs (wine, peyote, etc.), others engage in ritual behavior (chants, songs, and/or dancing). Shamanic trances produce out-of-body experiences involving various apparitions which may or may not be rendered into art forms.<br />I found the authors arguments concerning Shamanism persuasive and logical. The evidence they offer to support their thesis is excellent (many colorful photos). Their interpretation is helpful while not overreaching. Probably the most important aspect they stress is that while there is much diversity in cave art, a pattern is present. Best of all from my perspective, this thesis is gender and age neutral. Whatever Paleolithic humans did, women probably took part. This is a beautiful Abrams art book.s left behind in various camp sites indicate horses were not at the top of the menu.

THE TAROT by Cynthia Giles is frequently cited (by the late Joseph Campbell for one), and although many of her more salient points are mentioned elsewhere, the book remains a classic and a must read for anyone who would know more about the Tarot. My own copy is so underlined and earmarked I hardly know where to begin this review.<br />Giles' book covers the `History' and `Mystery' of the cards, as well as the `Lore' in a final section where she provides a sampling of decks, a booklist, and a number of `Tarot Ideas.' In the `History' section, she reviews what was known about the Tarot cards as of the early 1990s. Unfortunately, research funding for this topic is not easily acquired, so the full history--which would require an investigation of primary sources including material in the Vatican, not a rehashing of material collected by 19th Century scholars-has yet to be written. Even the six-volume series on WITCHCRAFT AND MAGIC IN EUROPE edited by Ankarloo and Clark has given the Tarot short shrift, although the sixth volume on Witchcraft in the 15th Century due out in December 2002 may make up the difference.<br />The Tarot may have first appeared in 15th Century Italy. Initially, it may have been nothing more than a set of playing cards, or, the Minor Arcana may have been a set of playing cards tacked onto the Major Arcana. On the other hand, the whole deck of 78 cards may have an `arcane' history. Certainly, the images found in the Major Arcana appeared in one guise or another prior to the 15th Century. Artists and writers have long recognized the importance of these images, but in the 20th Century, the psychologist Carl Jung suggested they were linked to archetypes of the unconcious and set loose a flood of prose and poetry. Recently, a new spate of books linking the Tarot to Psychology have appeared.<br />Giles covers the `Mystery' of the Tarot in the second section of her book where she reviews four major levels of a Tarot reading: Rational, Psychological, Psychical, and Metaphysical. Certainly, some charlatans have used a rational approach to trick an unsuspecting client. On the other hand, the rational approach may be used by an analytic reader, a thinking personality type who relies on the content of the cards to deliver the message. The Psychological reader may use cues obtained from the querant at a feeling level, while the Psychic will rely on intuitive avenues such as ESP or clairvoyance. The metaphysical reader uses a form of sensory input not detectable by most people. These four types of readers are linked to the four Myers-Briggs personality types - Thinking, Feeling, Intuitive, and Sensate (or in the language of Tarot - Swords, Cups, Wands, and Pentacles).<br />Lest you think the Divinatory properties of the Tarot are impossible, Giles reviews recent developments in Quantum and Particle Physics, as well as material on the Holographic Universe that indicate the universe is not a well known entity. Her discussion of the shortcomings of believing only what one can empirically deduce with the five senses is cogent and fascinating reading.Psychical, and Metaphysical.

In LASCAUX: THE FINAL PHOTOGRAPHS, Maria Ruspoli, historian and television producer, says  \\"underground Paleolithic sanctuaries were places not for living in but for initiation.\\" Ruspoli produced a film about Lascaux, and his posthumous book includes a relatively recent version of the history of the period within which the famous caves were decorated, as well as still shots of the cave interior and his film crew at work. The book indicates the interior of Lascaux will never again be subjected to filming. As it was, it took several years to complete the film owing to the fragile nature of the cave<br />Ruspoli suggests Lascaux served as some sort of gathering place for Cro-Magnon humans for religious or magical activity. He says early Europeans would have found the cave an inhospitable dwelling place. He suggests the hunters who decorated the cave walls probably lived outside them in huts made from animal skins-just as reindeer hunters near the arctic circle do today. He notes the preserved impressions of adolescent feet found in the prehistoric floors at Niaux and suggests they may have been from the feet of children participating in some sort of coming-of-age ceremony. On the other hand, he says, they may merely reflect the fact that children never lose an opportunity to press their feet in mud. (For a more in-depth discussion of the possible ritual use see Paul Bahn's JOURNEY THROUGH THE ICE AGE).<br />Most of Ruspoli's book consists of text he apparently wrote, but included is an essay by Brigitte and Gilles Delluc entitled, \\"The Eye of the Hunter and the Genius of the Artist.\\" Photographs by the Dellucs show limestone rocks the artist used as lamps and and oyster shell pigment containers. The Dellucs discuss the various paintings at Lascaux, including a mysterious unicorn.<br />Apparently, Ruspoli drew on material known to him prior to his death. The discovery of Chauvet was not included in this material. I don't think this omission detracts from the book, because understanding how historians and archeologists viewed and understood the people of the upper Paleolithic prior to the discovery of Chauvet can only help the reader appreciate the incredible discovery of Chauvet.

THE CAVE OF ALTAMIRA, edited by Antonio Beltran, tells the story of the famous paintings found in a cave in Spain in 1879. The book indicates the Altamira paintings date from the Solutrean period of the Paleolithic. Recent radiocarbon dating shows art in the Polychrome Chamber to be between 18,000 and 19,000 years old, placing it around 16,500 B.C. Pedro Saura Ramos, the photographer has a distinguished reputation. A number of prominent art historians have contributed interesting essays.<br />From the high elevation of the Altamira cave, one can see the `Picos de Europa' - a range of mountain peaks which must have appeared awesome to Paleolithic humans. Judging by the remains of creatures found in pits in the cave chambers as well as portraits of animals on cave walls, the countryside around Altamira must have been a virtual Eden. Evidence shows that great park-like settings near the cave held deer, roebuck, and wild boar, while open areas favored large bovines like horses and bison, rocky areas provided shelter for goats and chamois, and the nearby sea and fresh water lakes and streams were filled with shellfish and other marine life. Charcoal used in the wall paintings and found around the hearths reveal a coastal ecology where willow, juniper, chestnut and pine grew. The discarded bones indicate the cave was probably used as a gathering place for a relatively large number of people.<br />Pedro Sauro Ramos says it is impossible to convey the impression one receives standing on the cave floor looking up at the wall and it's illustrations. His photos are unusual in that he has held the camera in non-conventional ways and shot angles not normally seen in print. He provides wide-angled, then close-up shots of many of the animals so the reader can see detail revealed at close range. He notes that artists often took advantage surface features when creating an animal. Natural bosses were used to round out forms. A ledge provided the line of a deer jaw. Cracks and crevices highlighted horns and hinds.<br />As is the case with Lascaux, many of the paintings have been damaged by exposure to human bacteria and some of the photographs reveal black fungus. In addition, ceilings and walls have been reinforced to support badly damaged sections of the cave. In some cases the human supports interfere with the lighting or alter the appearance. For example, natural lighting from the cave entrance that once illuminated the numerous bovines of the famous \\"Great Panel\\" and that would have been seen on entering the chamber have been blocked by a concrete wall. For his photographs, Saura Ramos provided natural lighting to show how the painting would have appeared to Paleolithic humans.<br />The text includes reasonably good essays by a number of noted experts. My favorite is entitled, \\"Techniques, Individual Artists, and Artistic Concepts in the Painting of Altamira\\", by Matilda Muzquiz Perez-Seoane. In this essay, Perez-Seoane explains how bone marrow was used to illuminate the areas of the wall the artist painted in the dark interior recesses. Apparently, animal knee caps were filled with marrow which was lighted and provided a flame which illuminated without filling the chamber with smoke and choking the artist and/or blackening the ceiling or walls.ices highlighted horns and hinds. <br />As is the case with Lascaux, many of the paintings have been damaged by exposure to human bacteria and some of the photographs reveal black fungus.

In December 1994, three speleologists were exploring in the Ard&egrave;che region of France when they discovered an underground system of caves that came to be known as the Chauvet Cave (named for one of the three). Because these individuals were highly aware of the potential for finding ice age cave art in this region and extremely responsible human beings, they behaved with the utmost propriety, taking care to preserve their find for scientific research.  As a result, they have ensured the protection and continued existence of a treasure trove of paleolithic art. In DAWN OF ART: THE CHAUVET CAVE, Jean-Marie Chauvet, Eliette Brunel Deschamps and Christian Hillaire tell the story of the discovery that has rocked the art world.<br />The Chauvet Cave paintings were executed sometime during the Aurignacian Period. Radiocarbon dating indicates the wall art is probably about 30,000 years old, making it twice as old as Lascaux. CHAUVET CAVE (the book) includes over 100 pages of stunning photographs of this fabulous art. Literally hundreds of Aurochs, Bison, Mastodons, Horses, Lions, Bears and other animals have been depicted.<br />The Chauvet Cave paintings are extremely well executed, leading many archeologists and art historians to completely reformulate extant theories concerning the evolution of human art. It would seem our forebears were not clumsy louts who drew stick-like versions of organic life. The wall art at Chauvet shows perspective, modeling, color, line, form, and other visual aspects associated with post-Renaissance representational and abstract art. In my estimation, the Chauvet wall paintings -executed in charcoal, ochers, and other material - are comparable to the chalk drawings of Leonardo da Vinci and Picasso.<br /><br />The caves seem to have been the dwelling place of Cave Bears and perhaps humans, at different times. Bones of cave bears litter the floor of the cave and many cave bears have been drawn on the walls. In one chamber, a bear skull rests on an alter-like rock formation. Whether the skull was laid there for magical or religious or secular purposes related to art, or simply tossed there by a child is not known.<br />Scientists are attempting to determine the order of events in the Chauvet cave by studying the formation of overlying levels of sediment and accretions of calcite material on the walls, ceilings, and floors. Some of the wall paintings have been scratched by bear or lion claws indicating animal activity after the pictures were drawn. In other instances, paintings overlay earlier damaged surfaces. Several different artists apparently worked in the cave chambers over an extended period. The most beautiful paintings on the horse panel and elsewhere seem to have been executed by a master and/or his \\"school\\" of apprentices.<br />In the most distant chamber, lies the \\"sorcerer's chamber\\" where a creature with a bison head and human-like form has been painted in conjunction with a `Lion Panel'. The authors apparently are referring to the `sorcerers' of Trois-Freres in the Ariege and Gabillou in the Dordogne.  My favorite work is the `Great Lion Panel', a wondrous mural showing a group of grazing bison followed by a pack of lions. The lion heads and shoulders are massive, modeled, and menacing. The authors CHAUVET CAVE appear to have been most captivated by the `Horse Panel' which is also incredibly beautiful.<br />As is usually the case, Abrams has done a stellar job depicting beautiful works of art. Since very few of us will ever be allowed to visit the Chauvet Cave, this book may be the next best thing to being there.n alter-like rock formation.

THE CAMBRIDGE ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF ARCHEOLOGY is an overview of the discipline of archeology from it's inception til modern times. The book covers various aspects of archeology (physical, classic, historical, etc.) around the world - including sites in Asia and North America - although the focus is mostly on the `classic' sites in the Middle East which contain the remains of some of the oldest settlements on earth.<br />The history of the study of antiquities covers 500 years, from the Renaissance when \\"Antiquarians\\" and others mostly destroyed sites in an effort to recover \\"treasures\\" through the 20th Century when scientific archeology really began. I personally would have preferred a focus entirely on the 20th Century since much of what passed for the study of archeology before sites were systematically controlled and excavated is virtually useless except as an illustration of what not to do.<br />The last 20 years in Archeology have been very exciting, but this book provides only a very slender overview of recent work. The text is probably best suited for as an introduction to the topic for high school or even junior high school students in some cases. I bought the book for my 12-year old granddaughter who is entering 7th grade.<br />This history includes many biographical sketches of the male explorers who have studied mankind's artifactual evolution -- Sir Flinders Petrie who excavated in the Near East, Howard Carter who found Tutankhamen, Scliemann who found Troy, and V. Gordon Chile who went looking for the Aryans and coined the terms \\"Neolithic Revolution\\" and \\"Urban Revolution\\". The book suggests the latter's ethnocentric positions were not politically correct, but that he \\"repositioned\\" himself in later years.<br />I searched the photographs of Sir Max Mallowan and his workers and site visitors for Dame Agatha Christie, but she was no where to be found although Leonard and Katherine Wooley and Eric Barrows are pictured.

IMAGES OF THE ICE AGE by Paul Bahn and Jean Vertut is the 1988 edition of JOURNEY THROUGH THE ICE AGE published in 1997. Bahn says in the preface of the 1997 edition that it is \\"fully revised and updated.\\"  Comparing the two volumes leads me to believe Bahn incorporated much new information from peer reviewed articles and scholarly papers delivered/published in the 1990s in the 1997 version. The 1997 edition is much more beautiful than the 1988 version, although the older edition remains quite interesting.<br />Much of the original material in IMAGES (1988) can be found in JOURNEY (1997). Differences between the two editions include: 1/ Added sections to the 1997 version entitled \\"The Oldest Art in the World\\"; \\"Fakes and Forgeries\\"; \\"Portable Art\\"; \\"Rock Shelters and Caves\\"; \\"Art in the Open Air\\", and 2/ Dropped a section in the 1988 version entitled \\"Forms and Techniques\\".  Much of the material in the 1997 \\"Forms\\" section has been expanded to create the new sections on portable and parietal art. Bahn has also added enhancements throughout the 1997 version including a nifty text box that shows a \\"Chronological Chart of Cave Drawings\\" with radiocarbon dating results (estimates and standard errors) listed for each entry.<br /><br />The photographs in the 1997 version are larger than those in the 1988 version.  Bahn added a few new photographs to the newer edition (by the late Paul Vertut). Overall the text of the 1988 version is less polished. The 1997 version includes shaded text boxes and larger, easier to read print. The maps in the 1997 version are more articulated and the resolution is better.<br />The 1997 edition JOURNEY THROUGH THE ICE AGE is the better buy.	2002-08-15

For years, various friends have suggested I might enjoy reading THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR, and finally this summer I did. Auel's tale is speculative. Recent discoveries suggest it may contain some inaccuracies (the Black Sea may not have been salty as Auel suggests), however other findings support her ideas.<br />Auel made good use of her knowledge of medicinal herbs (although some of plants she names are native to North America not Europe where the action takes place). Her use of the extant knowledge of the fossil record, as well as geological and climatic information is excellent. However, her allusions to the sexual practices of traditional people appears to draw heavily on the work of Margaret Mead whose research on the sex lives of adolescent Samoans has been challenged (humans may be too jealous to have ever practiced \\"free love\\").<br />Auel's great gift to the reader is that she enables him to \\"see\\" life as it might have been lived by our ancestor(s) during the last Ice Age. Was it nasty, short and brutish as the 18th Century philosopher suggested, or was it one long sojourn in the wilderness where one could find all the food, medicine and other goods required to sustain a reasonably happy life?<br />Imagine being able to see the vast array of stars that make up the Milky Way. There are only a few places left in the Western United States where one can see the stars without atmospheric pollution. How stupendous it must have been to sit on a hillside at night looking at the heavens when the only light came from the moon, the stars, and a campfire. Is it no wonder our ancestors worshiped the natural world?<br />On the other hand, camping out all winter in a cave has it's downside. Depending on your location relative to the cave entrance you might be pretty damp and cold. But you could wrap yourself in warm furs and campfires would cheer you. Not knowing when the cold would end as food supplies dwindled would be frightening. Viewing a grazing herd of Aurochs or Mastodons must have been awesome. A first hand encounter with a cave lion would be terrifying.<br />Auel doesn't mention the clan of the cave bear by name, but the reader senses they are Neanderthals, and that the \\"others\\" are what we call `modern' humans. Auel's contrast between the traditional people who relied on memory for survival versus the new people who could think and reason and viewed the world as \\"cause and effect\\" is insightful and profound. But what if the world isn't really cause and effect. What if cause and effect are merely an explanatory principle converted into a religion of sorts. Those who believe in the metaphor may doomed to the Neanderthals' destiny - extinction.or Mastodons must have been awesome.

After a brief overview of the \\"oldest art in the world\\" and a discussion of the caveats associated with the term `art' as applied to extinct cultures Bahn describes the problem of taphonomy where knowledge of another older culture is shaped by the survival of artifacts. He also discusses the problem of controlled and limited access to ancient sites, as well as the use of modern photography to capture and transmit information about these sites to a larger audience.<br />Next, Bahn discusses different kinds of ice age art, which he categorizes as: 1) parietal art which takes the form of wall paintings and sculptures, floor tiles, and other large relatively immovable blocks of stone on which \\"signs\\" have been worked. Wall art can be incised, sculpted (additive or subtractive), or painted.  2) portable art which takes the form of figurines, musical instruments, tools, weapons, pottery, and other items that could be easily carried. Surviving portable items are generally made of ivory, bone, or ceramic clay or some other relatively durable inorganic substance.<br />Bahn then describes how analysts attempt to date ice age material.  At one time, scientists believed ice age art could not be dated because it was either inorganic or the methods available for dating organic material were clumsy and destructive. Recent improvements in dating techniques have changed that. For example, charcoal (an organic substance) was frequently used by ice age artists to create the black outlines seen in many wall paintings. For years, scientists thought the black paint was manganese dioxide, an inorganic substance. Since only a pinprick of paint is now required for radio carbon analysis, scientists have been able to test the black paint, discover it was carbon based, and date it.<br />The book is filled with wonderful technical material as well as plenty of stylistic and other material of interest to art historians. I most appreciated the section that reviewed the various theories about \\"Why\\" ice age art was created.  Was it art for art's sake? Was it the work of hunters practicing sympathetic magic? Was it a fertility ritual?  Bahn pretty much dismisses these theories with practical observations about their shortcomings.  What he does not dismiss is the creation of the ice age art for mythical purposes associated with healing rituals.  Parietal ice age art is located inside dark passages near water. Often this water derives from warm springs. Sometimes the water flows from dark passages into the daylight. Often, mysterious markings that correspond to the seasons and the moon can be found at the entryways to cave chambers. Does this circumstantial evidence point to ritual undertakings that involved a Mother Goddess?y\\" ice age art was created.  Was it art for art's sake?

I read the paperback copy of THE CARVETTII by Nicholas Higham and Barri Jones. I assume the paperback and hardcover books are similar. The maps, photographs, and illustrations in the paperback are quite good.<br />Higham and Jones have summarized the archeological work extant in 1985 concerning the area of Britain inhabited by the Carvettii who once populated modern Cumbria. Most of the material the authors discuss relates to 100-400 C.E. or the period of the Roman occupation. The authors systematically work through the various types of analyses archeologists employ to reconstruct the past. Coins, pottery, timber, stone, pasture walls, soil analyses and other material tell of another world of long ago.<br />Beginning with numerous aerial photographs of the countryside north of the Lake District, the authors describe the probable distribution of settlements and farms around the Solway Firth during the prehistoric and Roman periods. Because the archeological evidence is more readily available, the authors focus on material from old Carlisle and Penrith.<br />Roman settlements in Britain, particularly along the frontier, were organized around a network of forts or fortlets. The Romans constructed part of Hadrian's wall just north of Cumbria near the Solway Firth, at the edge of what is modern Scotland and, directly across the sea from Northern Ireland.<br />The Romans had penetrated further north, but hostile natives drove them South again. Hadrian's wall was constructed to hold the enemy, although the authors point out it did not go up all at once. The archeological record indicates the forts and fortlets that comprised the northern defenses including Hadrian's Wall were constructed over time. Old Carlisle, probably a tribal center in the prehistoric era, became a major fortification and command center somewhat south of the wall.<br />Higham and Jones surmise that over time the Roman soldiers occupying the forts became part of the local population know as the &quot;limitanei&quot; or people of the frontier. Some of the soldiers intermarried with the local population. Some of the soldiers were German mercenaries brought to Carlisle by the Romans. Others were Frisian Cavalry.

WITCHCRAFT AND MAGIC IN EUROPE - THE TWENTIETH CENTURY is number six in a series of six volumes covering the history of magic and witchcraft in Europe from ancient to modern times. Most of these volumes have included first rate scholarship. The fourth (and last) volume in the series, entitled, \\"The Period of the Witch Trials,\\" will be published later this year.<br />Series authors have attempted to define witchcraft and magic for each of the covered periods. The major impression one receives on reading these books is that the concepts or witchcraft and magic as well as the operational definitions are many and varied. As Willem de Blecourt of the Huizinga Institute in the Netherlands notes in his section in this volume, \\"Local witchcraft discourses are accentuated and even defined by the locally current value systems.\\" Blecourt's article is by far the best of the three in the book.<br />The first two sections of this book deal with witchcraft (Ronald Hutton, Bristol University) and Satanism (Jean la Fontaine, London School of Economics) as practiced in the 20th Century according to &quot;modern&quot; practitioners. These two sections are really more news article than scholarly essay. Each author has assembled material widely available to the public in autobiographical and biographical form, and to a certain extent \\"participated\\" in and \\"observed\\" some of the practices discussed. Both authors make it clear that Wicca (the Anglo-Saxon variant) and Satanism have nothing to do with each other. Wicca, or witchcraft as some practitioners prefer to call it, is considered by it's adherents to predate Christianity by several million years. Satanism, on the other hand, is based on the Hebrew word that means \\"the opposed\\" and requires historical references to Christianity that Wiccans eschew. The members of these two very different groups apparently loath each other. Many of the Wiccans are feminists while many of the Satanists have connections to neo-Nazis. The rationale for Wiccans is love the Earth, while that of the Satanists appears to be tear it up. Apparently, overly zealous and poorly educated Christians confuse the two. The Wiccans have been invited by the Archbishop to Canterbury Cathedral, the Satanists have not.<br />My favorite essay is the last, Blecourt's piece on witchcraft in Europe from the anthropologist's perspective. Most of his material comes from France, Spain, and the Netherlands. He includes material on Frisian witches, the work of Pitt-Rivers (an institute at Oxford University is named for him) who became famous for his studies of witchcraft in Andalusia, and Favret-Saada who studied witchcraft in the Bocage in France. Blecourt suggests anthropologists are faced with a perplexing situation in the attempt to study witchcraft-who to adopt as an informer. The person who informs you shapes your experience. The witch, the bewitched, and the unwitcher form a triangle with three perspectives. In the end, each will have a different tale, but you won't be able to get all three of them to confide in you.  Blecourt suggests all the ethnographer can do is see witchcraft from a liminal perspective-i.e. barely at all or at the edge of perception.e for Wiccans is love the Earth, while that of the Satanists appears to be tear it up.

I've owned the SIBLEY GUIDE TO BIRD LIFE AND BEHAVIOR for a while, and finally ordered the SIBLEY GUIDE TO BIRDS to complete the set. Both books are published by Audubon, the leading name in all things involving birds--at least that is what my 87-year old Aunt Marge says, and she's been to Audubon camp on many occasions.<br />The SIBLEY GUIDE TO BIRDS is too heavy to take into the field--it's really a reference book. Roger Tory Petersen's guide books are the best for field work--especially when children are involved. Sibley's guides are great reference books.<br />Unlike THE SMITHSONIAN HANDBOOK, Sibley's guide does not include a bird profile per page, but like the Smithsonian book and the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA the Sibley guide covers birds in the Northern Hemisphere (U.S. Canada, and Mexico). The National Geographic field guide is lighter than the Sibley guide and thus more likely to end up in the field as the title suggests, however, it is larger and more cumbersome than the Petersen guide and will probably travel in the camper trailer or glove compartment, not in your hand or back pack.<br />So--use Petersen for field work, get the Smithsonian guide for extra individual detail, and buy the Sibley guide for making  comparisons across species types. If you are really a bird nut, get the Sibley guide to Bird Behavior and the National Geographic bird book.  The pictures in the NG book are beautiful with lots of contextual detail--i.e. the Kingfisher eating, flying etc, however, although the NG includes the range maps, it does not include the little arrows that help you identify bird idiosyncracies. The Smithsonian and Petersen guides include the arrows and maps, and the Sibley includes maps and selected arrows (not in most cases).	2002-07-31

I may have finally found a relacement for my old Peterson Field Guide to Eastern Birds.  My new Peterson guide -- BIRDS OF EASTERN AND CENTRAL NORTH AMERICA -- arrived today and is it beautiful.  Best of all, it has a flexible cover and is light enough to carry into the field.<br />I have dozens of bird books, but this little guide is by far the best for field work. In addition to it's apparently waterproof and flexible cover, and being just the right size for a backpack (you can even carry it in your hand comfortably--no small feat for my arthritic hands), the new guide includes those nifty little arrows Peterson has used forever. The arrows, size specifications, and placement of maps on the same page as the species, allow the bird watcher to immediately locate and identify distingishing characteristics.<br />The Peterson guide does not contain as much detail as the SIBLEY GUIDE, or the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA, or the SMITHSONIAN HANDBOOK - BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA, but the Peterson guide is detailed enough for field work and much lighter. If you are a serious bird watcher you will want to buy all four books, but if you can only afford one or don't want to invest in all four, the PETERSON GUIDE is still the best bet. And, I still think the Peterson guide is the best one to use with kids.<br />The National Geographic guide includes some wonderfully modeled bird specimens with incredible detail that could only be produced digitally. The Peterson illustrations are hand painted and thus not as detailed. Although other books may show more detail, the question is -- will you really need all the detail in the field? Generally, you have only a few seconds to identify a bird. Peterson's arrow markers and the alternating sections of white and light bluish-grey backgrounds make it easier for me to flip around the book quickly.<br />The SMITHSONIAN GUIDE is fully loaded and very heavy. Each bird occupies a single page, and the guide provides a nice &quot;rule-of-thumb&quot; feature that allows you to gauge the bird's size by the book size. I use my Smithsonian guide for follow-up work after a trek in the field -- and in my own back yard.<br />Apparently, the Peterson folks have considered the effects of global warming as the winter and summer ranges of the birds have been extended. I now have five kinds of wrens visiting my small back yard in Arlington VA. And, when I travel to Wisconsin in a week or so, I can use the Peterson guide because it extends west to Minnesota.ule-of-thumb&quot; feature that allows you to gauge the bird's size by the book size.

And, when I travel to Wisconsin in a week or so, I can use the Peterson guide because it extends west to Minnesota.	2002-07-30

HAWKS IN FLIGHT by Peter Dunne is a useful book because it includes many photos and drawings of various species of Raptors in flight. When you see a Raptor, you generally have no way to identify it except by it's flight profile. Feather markings simply cannot be seen when a bird is sailing on a current of air or scuttling after prey. Once in a while I've surprised a hawk at rest, but generally it is well hidden in the leaves of a tree and takes off before I can get a good look. Even the Cooper's Hawk I see on my morning commute along the parkway is usually sitting back on a branch waiting for road kill (he is one fat lazy bird).<br />The photos in HAWKS IN FLIGHT show the birds as seen from the side flying close to the ground and as well as overhead. The book also includes drawings showing birds that resemble each other juxtaposed side by side as they would never appear in nature. Some of the photos are not very clear and the drawings are darker than I like, but no less a birder than Roger Tory Petersen recommended this book which nicely complements his own books.<br />Although the title includes the reference to hawks, the chapters cover Buteos, Accipiters, Falcons, Kites, Harriers, Eagles, Ospreys, and Vultures. The chapter on Accipiters covers the Cooper's Hawk, the hawk I see by the roadside in Washington DC. We also see Falcons chasing our song birds. A whole lot of back-stabbing goes on in this town.	2002-07-30

I have one major problem with SHAKESPEARE AND ME by Herman Gollob-there is too much Gollob and not enough Shakespeare.  Gollob is probably a very nice man, but he has too much to say about himself, and too little of it was of interest to me. Mr. Gollob apparently was a successful New York book editor before he retired and began teaching Shakespeare to adult classes. He name drops authors all over the place and adds bits of gossip here and there about former clients. When he isn't name dropping he is telling you about his family, his friends, his church, etc. which is fine if he's your neighbor or friend, but I did not pay for this kind of amusement.<br />I probably would have enjoyed Gollob's book if he had spent more time writing about his lectures on Shakespeare-condensing his material into a reasonably erudite set of essays as other professors have done before him. I am interested in Shakespeare (why I bought the book). Instead, he offers a few tantalizing bits and then rambles on all over the place. Where ever he goes, be it the theater, the classroom, the bookstore, or a hotel in Oxford, he seems to feel compelled to identify and comment on the people present. I almost had the sense that Mary, Bob, Anne and the others were going to be looking for their names in print and he was determined to oblige them.<br />He also mentions at least 50 times that he is an Aggie fan from Texas, that he did not like his mother, and that he thinks Shakespeare got many of his ideas from the Bible. Okay already, the Bible was a big deal in Shakespeare's England as anyone who has studied the Elizabethan age knows. The Elizabethans were early English Protestants whose whole approach was \\"back to basics.\\"  Elizabeth's successor James had the Bible translated from Latin into English. They teach you these things in the freshmen survey of English literature. If Gollob had delved into the connections between the Bible and Shakespeare's works, I might have been intrigued, but he does not.<br />Probably the thing I cannot forgive Mr. Gollob is that he hated the film \\"Shakespeare in Love.\\" Okay, he has a right to his own opinion, but these days many stories are spun from an original tale. Besides, if Gollob had done his homework he would know that no one knows very much about Shakespeare, and that Tom Stoppard has as much right to the playwright's life as the next guy.t.<br />Probably the thing I cannot forgive Mr. Gollob is that he hated the film \\"Shakespeare in Love.\\" Okay, he has a right to his own opinion, but these days many stories are spun from an original tale.

THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird is a wonderful book of wisdom about the plant world and life in general. Like many people my age, I cut my teeth on Disney's \\"Living Desert\\" back in the 1950s. That film killed the notion for me that nothing lives in Death Valley and if Death Valley can be alive what else is possible?<br />SECRET LIFE is like the old Disney films because the book describes science that challenges stereotypical mainstream thinking. Anyone who believes plants are sentient beings will love this book. If you've done much reading on this subject you've probably seen Tompkins and Bird quoted elsewhere.<br />In the first part of their book, the authors explore the attributes of plants and pretty much conclude they have everything in common with animals-except plants probably came first on the evolutionary ladder and prepared the way for animals. In fact, if earth was invaded by alien species, the authors suggest the aliens were probably plants. But, you say, plants have roots and stay put (for the most part) and plants produce chlorophyll. Shell fish (oysters, mussels) and sea anemones can be rooted to one spot and small protozoa-like creatures produce chlorophyll.<br />Probably the thing I like the best about this book is that finally, someone links the Chakras to real body parts-the seven endocrine centers--and explains the reasons why these &quot;hot spots&quot; are so important. Also, Tompkins and Bird explain the scientific reasoning behind Bach flower remedies and many other \\"new age\\" products you can find at Fresh Fields and other holistic stores.<br />Skeptics will always have doubts, but after 30 years of organic gardening and non-academic exposure to plants, I know Tompkins and Bird are onto something. So do many modern scientists who have discovered belatedly that much of what the authors described 30 years ago may be true afterall.<br />Cutting edge scientists are frequently ignored. Once upon a time some people thought George Washington Carver was a fruitcake because he thought plants had feelings (they do). Carver discovered many unusual things as did a number of other later Nobel winners, although sometimes folks like Gregor Mendel were not recognized until it was too late.<br />If you want to be a better person, a wiser consumer, a great gardener, and healthier, you owe it to yourself to read THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS.

KNOTWORK AND SPIRALS by Courtney Davis is a great way to introduce kids to the intricacies of Celtic design. While historical accuracy is not Davis' specialty, the author captures the spirit if not the intent of these designs. Call it artistic license.<br />The book is filled with examples of knotwork borders, medallions, and other elements used to illustrate the beautiful books painstakingly copied by Christian monks--like the Book of Kells--as well as other church artifacts. Davis shares some insights into the symbology or supposed symbology of some designs, such as the center of the spiral as the 'motionless mover' (God) with flows of energy as spirals around the center.<br />Davis includes a number of designs of his own creation, built up as he says from doodles. There are many pages of knots and spirals for coloring, so the book makes a nice workbook for children with an artistic bent.	2002-07-20

As complex as the Celtic knots appear, it all comes down to this, they can be reduced to curved and straight lines, the most important combination being the &quot;small hearts&quot;.  Sturrock says there are four basic hearts and she provides examples of each displayed against a grid. Almost anyone can create the grid as it consists of lines of dots applied with a ruler. These dots are then used as the basis for organizing the hearts, parts of hearts and straight lines that makeup the most complex design. The only other thing you need to study are the anima elements in the zoomorphic designs that also are based on hearts, parts of hearts and lines.<br />One needs the following for making Celtic knotwork: the materials listed by Sturrock, patience, imagination. Not everyone may be a gifted needleworker, but those willing to work at it will be able to master this straightforward art. I am using this book to instruct young girls.	2002-07-20

PATCHWORK PERSUASION by Joen Wolfrom is more art book than work book, but interesting nevertheless. If you've been making quilts for awhile you will find this book relatively straightforward. If you've never made a quilt or are not terribly practiced then it will prove less useful. Wolfrom provides an illustration of each of the quilts she discusses in the text (there are many of them) and for some, examples of the basic block used in the construction of the quilt.<br />Some of these quilts are quite literally works of art--many of recent origin, such as &quot;Layfayette Square&quot; (1993) and &quot;Georgetown on the Potomac&quot; (1995). In fact, most of the quilts were recently made by contemporary American artists. Excluding the cover example ('Sunlight and Wheels' by Junko Sawada of Yokohama-shi Japan) my favorite is Carol Bryer Fallert's 'Oswego, Illinois' which shows a stylized idyllic fall river scene viewed through a garden lattice. Consider this book the next best thing to the annual quilt show (or better depending on the exhibits at the show).	2002-07-20

Over the years I have attempted to use various books for prayer and meditation (Wicca and non-wicca). I found THE SACRED ROUND one of the more inspirational, and exactly what I need at this time. Following a busy workday and a 2-way commute, at the end of the day I need a respite. Lately, I've taken an hour to sit quietly, burn incense, mediate, and read material designed to quieten my overwrought soul. The past few weeks, I've been using THE SACRED ROUND and have felt rested, restored and renewed. What more can one ask.<br />THE SACRED ROUND is not as comprehensive as Scott Cunningham's books for solitaries (which are excellent) and is not a comprehensive historical review of Wicca and it's works (such as DRAWING DOWN THE MOON by Margo Adler). Hawke's book is simple and straightforward and focuses on tools one can use for daily practice.<br />Although Hawke describes rituals that involve more than one person, I think one person can use them. What is visualization if I cannot use it to imagine a ritual. Imagination is about conjuring up an image and exploring every facet of it. A really good exercise Hawke suggests involves creating an inner space where you can take yourself to 'get away from it all'. My intuitive self understands this suggestion and I am able to be elsewhere when I need to--as in the days when I used to &quot;daydream&quot; in school and transport myself out the classroom window and into a grassy field nearby.<br />In addition to material describing of various rituals associated with 'Western' lunar and solar holidays, she has included Eastern material including Chakra work.	2002-07-20

Davis does not inform the reader of the specific aspects of these pieces. In fact, her text is almost non-existent.<br />Some of the items shown appear to match items that precede Roman times, others seem to coincide with Roman and early Christian times, and others are very similar to items discoved in Anglo-Saxon tombs like Sutton Hoo, or Viking sites in Scandanavia and are thus contemporary with the early Middle Ages. Some designs are found on spoons, horse collars, or weather vanes, while others are taken from church sculpture or graveyard crosses.<br />As the elements shown are not categoried by historical period, or referenced or sourced, this is not the scholarly work that I hoped it might be. However, if you don't care it does not matter. I will be using the book for children's artwork projects this summer (i.e. coloring books).	2002-07-20

If you are as flipped out about lavender, mauve, and shades of purple as I am, and love pansies and lavender, the STITCH AND FLIP QUILTS may be for you. Valorie Wells includes several chapters (14 projects) and each chapter is devoted to making a specific quilt. She advises you as to what materials you will need, how to prepare the materials (cutting the appropriate sized pieces), how to arrange the materials (blocking), and how to sew the pieces together on a sewing machine. A teenage girl could make these quilts.<br />Stitch and flip involves sewing pieces of precut material together, and then flipping the joined piece so that the seam is hidden and then sewing another piece to the joined first piece and sew on. Wells has provided the creative design and you assemble it. She provides some information about attaching the quilt cover to a backing and topstitiching the ensemble, but it would probably help if you know how to do this or have another book that helps you work through the assembly steps.<br />Each of the quilt designs includes a fabric color selection, but if you are imaginative you can make other choices. It's difficult for me to visualize the &quot;pansy&quot; design without purple but these days anything goes. Wells provides a list of material sources including email addresses.	2002-07-20

Does Pasquale have a keen sense of smell because his nose is big or because the ratio of his nostrils to his nose is proportionately larger than that of other men. Can you really skin a porcupine by slitting the skin covering one of his footpads and blowing into the resulting hole until the beast inflates? And what about the appearance of Dante's Beatrice in the middle of the central piazza of Sutri? PASQUALE'S NOSE is mystifying, funny, enlightening, existential and religious.<br />Each of the &quot;local&quot; residents in the &quot;Very Ancient City of Sutri&quot; outside Rome has a story. There are plenty of secrets too. Rips is a storyteller who has collected, recorded, and repeats the tales he hears and the events he witnesses in this amusing, horrifying, and rustic little town.<br />In Sutri, horses run in races without riders, local contadini own the palazzo, and old men shift around the piazza with the sun. Sutri may have been built by the Etruscans, nobody knows. Charlemange may have visited, but the details are messy. Pontius Pilot may have been a native, but no one is admitting it. There are plenty of versions about how Sutri got it's start, but they conflict. Truth is relative in Sutri.<br />I don't know if Rips speaks Italian or not. He says the Sutris will not talk to you if you don't speak Italian. So, either he speaks Italian, or someone else did and told him what he heard, or he manufactured the tale. Maybe PASQUALE'S NOSE is take-off on all the stories in print about ex-patriate life in Italy, or France, or Poland. Rips says he is a non-non-person.<br />I read PASQUALE'S NOSE in six hours. Since the paperback is light as a feather, you can take it along on your next flight to Italy. When you arrive, you can check out Sutri yourself and discover the truth.	2002-07-12

No doubt about it, Ronald Hutton has undertaken a huge task in writing THE PAGAN RELIGIONS OF THE ANCIENT BRITISH ISLES. Hutton appears to be a well-read man who covered many sources of varying quality in the process of developing this text. He says he felt someone had to develop this synthesis, and his book is important, if for no other reason than it provides a \\"survey\\" of the material available in the early 1990s.<br /><br />Hutton's book is filled with pages of information from a variety of sources and academic disciplines cobbled together in more or less chronological order and interspersed with passages of speculation. As he has criticized Sir James Frazier for taking a similar approach, I am puzzled. Frazier's ideas may be out of vogue with British anthropologists (archeolgists) as Hutton suggests, but they crossed the Atlantic and led to the formation of \\"cultural\\" anthropology in the States (whereas Morgan's ideas about social structure went the other way and led to the development of \\"sociology\\" in the U.K.).<br /><br />Hutton refers to archeology as anthropology but archeologists are also historians or classical archeologists working at sites in Greece, North Africa and the Middle East -- all of them using different underlying approaches and world views.<br /><br />With their time-consuming and tedious techniques archeologists have only begun to excavate the available remains in England or anywhere else. Hutton's own statistics point to thousands of sites to be explored in Britain alone. Who knows, maybe another 'Sutton Hoo' awaits discovery. At any rate, one should be careful about forming opinions about the material record as it's early days. It took millions of years to create it, and archeology has been in existence less than 100 years. Since archeologists take the record apart with tooth brushes and strainers we won't have definitive answers in our lifetimes--if ever.<br /><br />Hutton does not really look at the written record in any detail, or examine the rich mythology of the Irish. For example, he covers passages from Gildas and Patrick in a few paragraphs where historians have written whole books examining the use of Latin words by these writers who witnessed the \\"dark ages\\" which are the source of much archeological speculation.<br /><br />Revisionist historians sometimes seem to have persuaded themselves they can be objective where others have not, but this may not be true. As one researcher reverses another only to be reversed by some one else, we realize that all humans start with a world view, and that this view affects perception. Probably the most important contribution of this book is that like our ancestors (the ancient ones), we can believe what we want.e Irish.

Eleanor Perenyi's book GREEN THOUGHTS is a memoir of sorts. She apparently never wrote another book on gardening, but as Alan Lacy says, sooner or later every writer who gardens will write a book about gardening. At the time her book was published in 1981, she had worked in her own garden in New England for a number of years. She says she had been gardening for 30 years, but does not indicate if she is including the years she lived in Hungary her birthplace. She was an immigrant who migrated first to Europe and then to America where she worked in New York as editor of Madamoiselle and lived and gardened in New England.  Her detailed observations about gardening are of limited use to those who live and garden elsewhere in the States. However, Perenyi has many wise 'thoughts' that can be acted on in almost any garden, including the advice `don't be overly neat' - something that's taken me a while to appreciate.<br />Perenyi's book contains many original insights and much information not widely available at the time she wrote her book - such as gardening tips from `Organic Gardening Magazine'.  Perenyi wrote only one book on gardening but she is often quoted-the main reason I wanted to read GREEN THOUGHTS.  She organized her comments Alpha to Zeta (actually ends with `W' for Woman's Place), which are literally a set of small essays ranging from a paragraph in length to several pages on various topics from hedges and lawns to onions and potatoes.<br />My favorite essay is \\"Woman's Place\\" which appropriately enough covers the history of women in the garden from Eve to Eleanor Perenyi. She reveals the sad truth that women invented horticulture while men were off hunting in packs, only to be thrown out of the garden at a later date when men &quot;took charge&quot; of the fields. Over the eons, women were relegated lower and lower positions garden-wise until they became decorative ornaments - well at least in upscale gardens East and West, whether the Seraglio with it's harem or the Virgin's Bower.<br />In the gardens (er..vegetable patches) of traditional societies she says women became beasts of burden. Perenyi notes that Oriental women do the weeding in the rice paddies and carry the firewood in Africa. At any rate, while European upscale men were busy adapting their posh Renaissance gardens to the latest `Arabasque\\" notion or plowing up the 18th Century landscape under the guidance of Sir Humphrey Repton (and still hunting in packs one notes), enterprising nuns and country women with their &quot;messy&quot; cottage gardens preserved the diversity of the native species of plants. In the 20th Century, Gertrude Jeckyll and William Robinson discovered what the old wives had been up to and introduced \\"native\\" plants to upscale country gardens. The moral of the book is that men's overly tidy and rational gardening habits are bad and women's messy garden habits are good.

The Crusades are back in the news again (they were out-of-fashion for awhile), but don't believe everything you read in the newspapers or hear on tv, take time to read a few good books on the subject. Begin with JJ Norwich and Bernard Lewis to get a handle on the Crusaders and Byzantium and the Holy Land, then go onto Cathars and the 'Reconquesta' of Spain. Perhaps you will come to the conclusion that I have--the European Crusaders spent more time outside the Levant than in it, although Lewis suggests Europeans probably acquired the idea of mounting religious jihads from the Arabs who were quite good at it.<br />Christiansen has written an excellent and well-researched book on the NORTHERN CRUSADES. His writing is very readable and unbiased, and he has availed himself of many original documents. I particularly appreciated the material he included that covered the internal church debates on &quot;what constitutes a 'just war'&quot; or when can Christians fight in the name of Christ?<br />The perspective of some clergy during the High Middle Ages was that good reasons existed for a Crusade or a 'Just War' with the Muslims because they had seized formerly Christian lands in the Levant, North Africa, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and Eastern Europe. However, these same clergy argued there was no basis for a 'Just War' with the Byzantine Greeks, the Orthodox Russians, or non-Christian pagans who wanted to become Christian without fighting. Unfortunately, clear thinking did not always prevail.<br />Christiansen suggests the Crusades were waged for the purpose of Christianizing the tribes who lived at the Eastern end of the Baltic Sea. In the end they were Christianized and mostly Latinized, although Russia chose the Greek Orthodox side. People who lived in what is today Lithuania, Poland, and Russia were invaded by Germans, Swedes, and Danes. Christiansen's book highlights a period when German warrior monks known as the Teutonic knights seized much of the land.<br />Like the Templars and other warrior-monk orders in Western Europe that formed in response to the loss of the Holy Land, the Teutonic Knights were motivated by a desire to infuse Christianity in &quot;heathern&quot; peoples. Christiansen says that although some individuals undoutedly grew wealthy, &quot;the profit motive is not a convincing argument&quot; for the behaviour of the monks. &quot;To present these wars as false -- either as matters of interest disquised as matters of conscience, or simply as misnamed events -- is too easy.  This type of judgment is itself fraudulent.&quot;<br />The Crusades were bloody and cruel, and as is usually the case, folks at the low end of the ladder suffered the most. But Christiansen poses a question -- were these people who led relatively &quot;free&quot; lives at subsistence levels better or worse off when they became Latinized, Christian serfs and/or peasants? Christiansen provides plenty of material to fuel both sides of the argument.<br />Apparently, the Lithuanians and Polish did not think the Germans made good masters, and in the end they prevailed in defeating the Teutonic Knights. Although the Polish and Lithuanian people Christianized, they never accepted German rule -- a fact not lost on the Nazis. This stance continued long after Germany became mostly Protestant in the 16th Century and Lithuania and Poland remained staunchly Roman Catholic.ike the Templars and other warrior-monk orders in Western Europe that formed in response to the loss of the Holy Land, the Teutonic Knights were motivated by a desire to infuse Christianity in &quot;heathern&quot; peoples.

I particularly enjoyed GREEN MAN because the author William Anderson brings together and explores many subjects of interest to me -- the natural world, mythology and archtypes, Gothic church architecture, Wordsworth, and the concept of Gaia. GREEN MAN has been described by it's critics as a book about Mythology and Ecology, but I think Anderson has also written a very fine art history.<br />Anderson suggests most art historians and critics have overlooked the Green Man as an archetypal element and artifact. And, although I've taken several art history classes on the topic of Western church architecture, I can't recall a single instructor discussing the foliate masks, vine disgorging heads, or human fruiting vegetation Anderson clearly describes. The photographs in his book show they can be found in many places in churches including on rood screens, columns, capitals, corbels, tympani, stringcourses, pediments, flying buttressses, with the Holy Virgin and child, and weeping over Christ.<br />Anderson suggests the Green Man (or our need for him) has morphed into variation after variation over the millenia. The Green Man probably began life as a Celtic mythical figure, but by the 20th Century he had become a hidden Art Deco element. His most amazing incarnation occurred in the Middle Ages in the Gothic cathedrals, especially very sacred spots like Chartres in France. Chartres was one of Joseph Campbell's favorite haunts, and he has shared many of his insights about the cathedral, as has the art historian Panofsky.

WITCHCRAFT AND MAGIC IN EUROPE: THE MIDDLE AGES is the third book I've read in this series of six books edited by Bengt Ankarloo and Stuart Clark. So far my favorite has been the first (chronologically) which focused on &quot;Biblical and Pagan Societies&quot; although &quot;The Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries&quot; was equally well written. In November 2002, the fourth book in the chronology &quot;The Period of the Witch Trials&quot; is scheduled for publication and I can hardly wait to read it. &quot;The Middle Ages&quot; volume ends just as the wicked Malleus Maleficarum is published 1487 and if you've studied this topic you know what comes next.<br />Historians participating in the 'Witchcraft' project are university scholars and experts in their respective topics. Their research is intensive and exhaustive. At times, sections read like a thriller novel and at times only a scholar could love the work. Topics and authors in this volume include (in addition to Peters below) 'Medieval Magic: Definitions, Beliefs, Practices' by Karen Jolly of the University of Hawaii, and 'Trolldomr Rituals' by Catherina Rudvere of Lund University.<br />Jolly suggests the concept/phenomena of magic is difficult to identify and describe, let alone explain. She tracks developments in the early Middle Ages and discovers magic for the devout Christian serf or aristocrat was not at all comparable to notions depicted in some fanciful modern films and books. No green-faced wart-covered old hags lived in Europe in the old days. Those biddies bloomed in the art of the Renaissance. Jolly suggests Christian beliefs, rituals and medical practices merged with local native traditions and formed something different from the religion preached in the Levant by early Church fathers. Rudvere's work is incredible. She deals with material that is over 1,000 years old from the Scandanavian cultures.<br />Part 3 of the book, 'The Medieval Church and State on Superstition, Magic, and Witchcraft From Augustine to the Sixteenth Century' by Edward Peters of the University of Pennsylvania takes the reader up to the end of the Middle Ages in Europe when the Malleus Maleficarum was published in 1487. To their credit, many Roman Catholic leaders and clergy thought the Malleus Maleficarum was &quot;over the top&quot; and the work of a crackpot. Sadly, interest in the book was renewed during the Protestant Reformation when &quot;Christians&quot; used the book to &quot;purify the church&quot; -- the period to be covered by the &quot;Witch Trials&quot; mentioned above.<br />Peters essay attempts to explain why persecution of &quot;witches&quot; and &quot;heretics&quot; evolved after the 12th Century. Certainly a renewed interest in the writings of the Romans, Greeks, and Egyptians and the emergence of groups like the Cathars and Waldensians stirred the pot. However, Peters suggests the real reason persecution took such a decidely evil turn had to do with politics and land grabs. A handy way to rid yourself of someone you envied or whose goods you coveted was to accuse them of witchcraft. The clergy became involved because they felt a need to root out the devil, but sometimes they were connected to greedy princes who needed churchly approval.<br />As has been the case with the other books in the serieis, all the essays in this book are informative. If you have an interest in the topic of Wicca, witchcraft, or paganism and want to learn more about what probably happened in the Middle Ages in Western Europe, read the book.Augustine to the Sixteenth Century' by Edward Peters of the University of Pennsylvania takes the reader up to the end of the Middle Ages in Europe when the Malleus Maleficarum was published in 1487.

TAROT AND PSYCHOLOGY: Spectrums of Possibility, by Arthur Rosengarten, is a complex but well-written book. Rosengarten is a Jungian psychologist who has written a book primarily for fellow clinicians. However, Tarot readers of any persuasion will probably find the book informative and interesting.<br />Rosengarten suggests psychoanalysis is based more on art than science, and as an art form Tarot can play a role. He says his method involving the use of Tarot cards is both effective and pragmatic. In his own practice, he has found Tarot can play a role in facilitating quality ananysis within time constraints (managed care). To support his claims of the effectiveness of his methods, he presents the results of some empirical work he conducted using Tarot with a purposive sample of adults in domestic violence treatment programs. He says his work can be replicated and is thus subject to empirical review.<br />Either Rosengarten's writing is incredibly clear, or I was in the right place at the right time, or both, but based on my reading of this book, I think I may finally understand what Jung meant by synchronicity. Rosengarten suggests each of the Tarot cards has a spectrum of meanings and that each of these meanings is augmented when viewed in conjunction with other cards (and their meanings) in a particular spread. The synchronic view contrasts with a linear interpretation of the Major Arcana of the Tarot cards which some see as representative of the stages of personality development or journey of the soul.<br />As nearly as I can tell, Rosengarten is suggesting that when one engages in a Tarot reading, a \\"higher power\\" takes over and a path to enlightment is opened. Having experienced the Transcendent I have to agree with him. However, whether your view is diachronic or synchronic I think you will find Rosengarten's book intriguing.	2002-06-25

THE GREAT GAME by Peter Hopkirk is wonderful background reading if you want to know more about:  1) the current situation in Afghanistan (tribes, warlords, attitudes, fighting, treachery, oppression of women, slavery); 2) Russian and English relations relative to Central Asia (tribes, warlords, attitudes, fighting); 3) Military intelligence or lack thereof; 4)Endless struggle.<br />As far as I am concerned, Hopkirk has written a masterpiece. His focus is Central Asia from about 1800 C.E. to WWI when both Russia and England attempted to establish dominance in trade and political influence over the many fiefdoms or minor kingdoms of warlords and/or petty despots in Central Asia and retain influence with peripheral areas in China, India, Persia, and the Ottoman Empire.<br />Hopkirk has written extensively on the topic of Central Asia, and I will read other books by him. However, I will have to recover from the 524 pages of THE GREAT GAME before I take on another volume. I'm exhausted. Although the English and the Russians apparently never went to war with each other during this period, they wore out their own people and resources and soldiers fighting proxies. In Russia's case, the struggle ended with the demise of the Tsar.<br />THE GREAT GAME can be thought of as a giant chess game. The two players (Russia and England) were constantly fomenting strategies for taking the other guy's khan. As a result, they were slaughtered, slaughtered others and suffered a lot of frostbite. The game went on as long as it did in part because the British government could not decide whether to be assertive or passive (hawk or dove). As the British elected their officials, one can see why the position of the British vacillated. The Tsar on the other hand was single minded most of the time (there were several Tsars) but in the end it cost him his life as well as the lives of his familiy members.<br />If the inhabitants of Central Asia were peaceful natives I might feel worse about the incursions of the Russians and English, but they weren't. The Central Asians set the stage for invasion of their own lands when they invaded Europe over and over until the Europeans learned how to fight back. In addition, the societies in Central Asia were inhumane and relatively barbaric. Slavery and harems were a way of life, and in many instances the slaves lived in the harems.<br />Hopkirk spent many long hours in libraries pouring over the military archives, journals, contemporary books, correspondence and anything else he could find to flesh out his story. His narrative switches back and forth and he makes a valiant effort to not take sides. I think he accomplishes this, but I am an Anglophile so I may be biased. Hopkirk does not pass pc judgement on his characters, who literally come from the pages of history. So, you can judge for yourself after having read this massive book if you think anything at all was accomplished by either England or Russia.  Probably the saddest part of the story is the heroic efforts of the Gurkas and Sepoys and Sikhs who were never fully accepted as equals and without whom the British would have failed miserably at whatever they undertook.<br />Some journalists have indicated the U.S. will fail in Afghanistan just as the British and Russians did. Having read this book I think this is a mis-characterization of what occurred in the past and what is happening now in Afghanistan.  The long struggle between the British and the Russians ended in a stalemate that prevented either country from accomplishing the goal of economic dominance.  The story is different today since Russia and England are allies-along with the U.S.-and while the U.S. and allied interest may be economic as well as altruistic, their actions are not likely to lead to war among the allies.

Many social scientists recognize self identity as a precious aspect of individuality, but most social scientists are interested in generalizing, hence the stuggle to conceptualize, define and measure the group identity. There are good legal and political reasons for categorizing people, how else for example could you measure the effects of a genocide--or commit it for that matter. The Nazis and the analysts who attempted to measure the atocities of the Nazis used administrative records with information about ethnicity and religion to do their jobs.<br />CENSUS AND IDENTITY is a nice compendium of essays about the attempts of governments around the world to collect and use information about race, language, and ethnicity in censuses. David Kertzer and Dominique Arel provide an overview of the book in which they state, &quot;identity is a constructed thing and it is constructed over time and with a shifting awareness of values and meaning attached to certain categories, some of which are more meaningful than others.&quot;<br />Melissa Nobles' essay, &quot;Racial categorization and the censuses&quot; focuses on two large census efforts--Brazil and the United States. Both countries have attempted over the past two hundred years to define and measure race with mixed results.<br />Calvin Goldscheider compares the efforts of Israel, Canada, and the United States to categorize ethnicity in censuses. The Israeli government stresses religion, while the U.S. government eschews it.<br />Dominique Arel's essay, &quot;Language categories in censuses..&quot; covers the efforts of several countries to define and measure language fluency. Just when does one become fluent in a language. Professor Higgins told Eliza Doolittle that most English ladies could not speak English!<br />Alain Blum discusses the trials of the French in his essay, &quot;Resistance to identity categorization in France.&quot; Seems the Algerian descent folks have a different idea of what it means to be French.<br />Peter Uvin's essay, &quot;On counting, categorizing, and violence in Burundi and Rwanda&quot; is a chilling example of ethnic identification gone wrong. How did the Tutsis and Hutus know who to kill? Population exchanges between the two countries seemed to be the only way to avoid additional killing. But who just who was what and how their &quot;papers&quot; were created became a nightmare.<br />My favorite essay was written by David Abramson, &quot; Identity counts: the Soviet legacy and the census in Uzbekistan.&quot; Just what is a Tajik anyway, and when is a Tajik really an Uzbek? Some funny things happened in the censuses taken over several decades as the size of the population of Tajiks and Uzbeks changed rather dramatically.

Currently, the Federal government recognizes White, Black, American Indian, Asian, and Pacific Islanders as race groups, and Hispanic as an ethnic group. If the Arab Institute has it's way, Arabs may soon become separate group. CHANGING RACE by Clara Rodriguez is a good summary of materials prepared by U.S. Census Bureau analysts as they have struggled to operationally define and measure population subgroups that are in essence social constructs.<br />Rodriguez' book covers the history of measuring &quot;race&quot; in the United States from the first census in 1790 to the 1990 census 200 years later. Most of her book focuses on the past 25 years when race issues have been very salient. During this period, Census Bureau analysts have operationalized criteria established in regulations written by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the Executive Branch of the Federal government (i.e. the White House). OMB is charged with recognizing the race and ethnic categories referred to in legislation written by the U.S. Congress, official representatives of the American people who presumably pass laws that reflect the people's interests and desires.<br /><br />One might say there's plenty of slip between cup and lip, and like most things done in Washington, what actually gets done at the field level (the Census Bureau) may not be what the American people intended. However, like other government field agencies, the Census Bureau, takes it on the chin when members of the public complain. Rodriguez book attempts to describe what happens at the field level--who complains and Federal responses to those complaints.<br />Rodriguez book does not adequately address the issue of what happens to blanks--many Americans can't or won't respond to race and ethnic questions. Non-responses for these individuals to the race and Hispanic items are filled in via an imputation process that generally assumes birds of a feather flock together. In other words, if you did not fill in your form someone filled it in for you. The assigned values reflect the characteristics of your neighbors. To the extent you are like your neighbors this is not a problem.<br /><br />Whether you like the idea of measuring race and ethnicity or not, this is an informative book and one every citizen should read--and every person who plans to be a social scientist. You can't change anything if you don't understand how it works and you certainly should not be conducting research if you don't know what race is or isn't.<br />Many political interest groups have discovered how race categories become reified via government recognition and use this knowledge to their advantage.

The first thing I want to say about SMYRNA 1922 is that I am of neither Greek nor Turkish descent so I have no vested interest in the &quot;truth&quot;.  Secondly, I have an Armenian friend who once told me in a sad but offhand way as we were trading confidences over coffee, that her grandparents had been buried in the sand up to their necks and had their heads lopped off by Turkish soldiers. Thirdly, I had an occasion once where I met with a Turkish delegation as part of my job and listened to them for two hours while they talked about &quot;Armenian lies.&quot; Two things struck me about this rather bizarre meeting: 1) Why did they care what I or anyone else in my agency thought about something that happened many years ago? 2) Why did they go on for two hours denying something no one had accused them of, at least no one in my office?<br />Marjorie Dobkin's insightful book is about the failure of the Great Powers, including the U.S., to facilitate a peaceful outcome in Anatolia in the period following WWI. SMYRNA covers the subsequent destruction of the city by the forces of Kemal Attaturk (although he apparently lay the blame for the massacre at his predecessor's door). Following the destruction of Smyrna, almost two million Greek and Armenian Christian refugees fled what is today Turkey and was then the Ottoman Empire.<br />At the Cannes film festival this year, &quot;Ararat&quot; has won all sorts of praise. The film by Atom Egoyan (The Sweet Hereafter) tells the story of the Armenian holocaust in 1922. I don't know if Dobkin's book is the basis of the film, but it certainly would make great background reading. I suspect 'Ararat' will become to the Armenians what 'Schindler's List' has become to the Jews. Since Turkey is apparently vowing to fight its distribution (New York Times, Arts, 6/7/02) it remains to be seen  whether the film will make it to the states.<br />Dobkin has assembled a huge amount of information for her book and provides copious footnotes so you can check the sources. However, many of the U.S. sailors and other eyewitnesses have died since the first edition was published about 30 years ago.  Following the initial publication, Dobkin became aware of much more material, and she incorporated much of the new material in the book. Dobkin writes well--like an excellent investigative reporter, which she very well may be. Earnest Hemingway covered the disaster as a Toronto news reporter, and Dobkin's writing is comparable his, as well as being very scholarly.<br />I've spent most of my life reading about genocide and inhumanity in one form or another, but SMYRNA has to be one of the most harrowing tales I've ever read. Think Dachau. Think Auschwitz. Think the worst. To bad CNN wasn't filming, although believe it or not someone did film the event--and Dobkin obtained a photo of the quay lined with over 200,000 people which is shown on the cover of the book.

In the early 1970s, I left my abusive husband, took my three kids and resumed my education (I was a high school dropout age 28 with three kids). Those were the days of &quot;Earth shoes&quot; that tilted your body into a more upright position, and the &quot;discovery&quot; of yogurt and acid rain. Although I did not realize it at the time, it was the beginning of the renewal of the Woman's movement.<br />My new friends included a small group of women in their late twenties and early thirties who had left abusive husbands, had small children, and were in the midst of gaining a new awareness that later on took on the sobriquet, &quot;consciousness raising.&quot; Among other tools we acquired a number of books including, THE WOMEN'S ROOM and DIET FOR A SMALL PLANET.<br />DIET FOR A SMALL PLANET is a gem, not because it contains wonderful recipes (it doesn't) but because when you read it, you can get an inside view of a subculture that has disappeared. Sometimes I think the happiest moments of my life occurred in those days. I had no money, but I was in college--a life long dream my mother had and never realized--and with friends who helped me to feel good about myself for the first time in my life. DIET FOR A SMALL PLANET nourished this feeling. DIET explained how the real food chain worked and that everything we ate affected some other life form. We learned that we could eat and hurt others less, and save a few bucks because the meals were cheap.<br />My kids still laugh at some of the meals I served them based on the recipes in DIET. Over the years, we've had many discussions about which food was worst. They say the &quot;yogurt and barly soup&quot; wins hands down. This book explains how to make awful food and many better veggie books are on the market. However, you won't buy this book for the recipes, you'll buy it for it's insight. Laughing at DIET because it is naive is laughing at the Wright Brothers because they didn't build and fly a Concorde. Read DIET with an unbiased eye and understand it was the food bible for a group of young American women who were &quot;backward&quot; because their society wanted it that way, but believed they could become educated and help change the world for the better--and in spite of all the recent sorrow, the world for women and children is better than it was 30 years ago.

Maybe I first noticed Dragonflies one of those summers I attended Girl Scout camp and I saw a pretty blue-winged insect shimmering over the lake where we went for our daily swim. Or maybe I saw my first fly when I sat on a creek bank waiting for the catfish to bite. I saw them so often when I was a child growing up in the rural South and Midwest, that I took them for granted. Not until the great Henry Mitchell, a local gardener and columnist with the Washington Post (and author of many books on gardening) wrote about his horse troughs and Dragonfiles did I sit up and say, &quot;You mean there's more than one kind??&quot;<br />Mr. Mitchell taught me that Dragonfiles can drown in deep water if they try to take a drink, and that Dragonflies, Damselflies and Butterflies all need shallow water. That's why you see them hovering over mud puddles and why every bird bath needs a shallow spot. In Mr. Mitchell's garden, the Dragonflies drank from the leaves on his water lillies. If you plant water lillies, you will see a Dragonfly or two or three.<br />The BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO DRAGONFLIES is destined to help me help my granddaughters develop an appreciation of Dragonfiles and Damselflies. According to authors Nikula, Sones, and Stokes, the major differences between the two are wing shapes, wing positions, eye positions, overall appearance and flight style. Some of the photos even depict Dragonflies that might be confused with Butterflies. We are going to learn about: 'Cruisers', 'Spiketails', 'Clubtails', 'Petaltails'<br />and a whole lot more. Seems that pretty neon blue insect I've seen hovering over the pond may be a 'Pond Damsel.'<br />Each of the illustrated &quot;Identification&quot; pages in DRAGONFLIES contains a photograph and text description of the fly and a map of Northern America depicting the range of the insect in question. Each map shows the entire country plus Canada. The pages of the book are color coded by family type so you can link the Dragonfly or Damselfly to it's family.

Lately, I've been feeling a bit conflicted. On the one hand, if I allow myself, I can indulge in 3 hours of nightly news plus Internet and paper news. Most of it is pretty grim. On the other hand, I have Wicca friends who are moving away from Washington to get away from all the negative energy. I feel like running away myself, but cannot.<br />I read ADVANCED WICCA thinking I would learn new methods, rituals, and practices I could use to soothe my troubled soul. Telesco is indeed a soothsayer and has plenty of suggestions for strengthening one's spiritual life. However, she also says becoming an Adept in the craft (advanced in Wicca) requires taking steps along a path you may not be prepared to take.<br />Like many religions, Wicca has a inward comtemplative and an outward active side. Wicca is probably the most individual religion around but it isn't about becoming a hermit. After all, Wicca is about wisdom, and what good is wisdom if you can't share it?  What good does it do to only look after your own skin? You may be a solitary, but you have a responsibility to the world around you.<br />Telesco says, &quot;If you are walking the Adept's Path, you must leave apathetic attitudes behind you and become proactive here and now. Nothing less than a positive, mainstream future for the Craft is at stake.&quot; These are pretty scary words for folks who are just beginning to feel their way after several centuries of  persecution and riducule that even today are pretty strong. Telesco says, that while most religions of the world have a symbol, such as a cross, a star or a cresent, the pentacle of Wicca sends many folks into spasms. While most religions have high holy days that are respected (or supposed to be) in our diverse culture, many still hide their involvement in the high holy days of Wicca--which are the oldest celebrations on earth. those few members of Wicca who dare to practice in the open are often ridiculed in the press.

I first crossed paths with Dr. Chomsky when I took a linguistics class way back when. As far as I know, he remains a leading figure in that field. UNDERSTANDING POWER is a distillation of material from many talks Chomsky gave on NON-linguistics topics during the late 1980s through the mid-1990s. One or two excerpts came from talks he gave in the late 90s.<br />Chomsky's subjects cover everything that should concern a good liberal--oppressed workers, bad schools, free speech, etc.--which I think I am, although not a card-carrying sort as I seldom participate in demonstrations. However, elected officials hear from me from time to time and I vote. I also belong to a union, engage in organic gardening, recycle, drive a 12-year old Toyota, and voted for Al Gore (okay, okay, I know you guys voted for Nadar).<br />I don't agree with everything Chomsky says. For one thing, I don't agree with his position on Israel. I am closer to Thomas Friedman on that score--whom Chomsky pretty much characterizes in this book as a patsy for the powers he's trying to help the reader understand. I do agree with Chomsky that large corporations are a VERY big problem worldwide as the French historian Braudel has pointed out in his wonderful books. I also agree that the patent and trade business is troubled--although Chomsky does not fully discuss how the corporations buy up \\"threatening\\" patents, i.e. patents that would produce less costly substitute goods. I also agree that many laws on the books concerning worker rights and health and safety and environmental issues are not being enforced. MANY laws are not being enforced and individuals can and must join forces to make the authorities act. Maybe I am naive, but I belive voting the right person into office helps.<br />Chomsky really does not offer solid ideas for fixing the current world-wide military-industrial complex and rapidly deteriorating environment other than to say \\"you guys get out there and do something.\\" Maybe he functioned as a motivational speaker at these sessions but quite frankly I would have left depressed not energized. Why not focus on success stories--like the one PBS told the other night about the Swiss firm that found a way to produce a non-toxic product (Susan Sarandon narrated it so you know it was good.) I believe companies can be and have been \\"encouraged\\" to act responsibly by the representatives of the people (McDonald's and chickens and styrofoam cups for example). I also believe some corporations are more reasponsible than others.<br />The real question Chomsky does not address in this book is who within the corporation holds the power. If you have a 401K or own stock outright you know you have little say-so, but the owners of the means of production can organize and act, and have organized and acted. The most important person is the consumer however, and Chomsky doesn't say enough about how consumers can and have affected bad corporate citizens. Chomsky points out that corporations are bottom-line oriented and vulnerable on that account.  Why not go all the way and talk about how consumers can boycott goods and services until they respond. And, be a responsible consumer. If you want cleaner air, don't drive a SUV. Riding lawn mowers, leaf blowers, and weed whackers foul the air unless they are electric-powered.<br />Chomsky says he thinks it is important to read material written by individuals with differing perspectives. I agree. That's why I read his book AND I read conservative writers in the Wall Street Journal and Washington Times--and why I read THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND by Alan Bloom (Chomsky discusses this book in his book).<br />Lastly, I found the online footnotes associated with this book extremely interesting. Much of what Chomsky cites has been taken from secondary material written by the very journalists he disparages.as a motivational speaker at these sessions but quite frankly I would have left depressed not energized.

1520261:US	51379338	R2O4GIDTK6YD0T	0792274512	426421212	National Geographic Field Guide to the Birds of North America : Revised and Updated	Books	4	20	21	N	N	A bird book for the car......	For years, I've used the Peterson field guides to identify birds.  Most of my bird watching has taken place in the Eastern U.S. mountains and north and south of the coastal area where I live, as well as WI (summer) and LA (winter). The Petersen guide book for the Eastern region meets most of my needs, but I also own several other books (Smithsonian and Audubon). I became interested in the National Geographic book BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA because I admire the NG magazine.<br />The NG is a heavier book than the Eastern Peterson, perhaps because it shows birds from both the Eastern and Western areas of the country, but the Peterson maps show the full range of &quot;Eastern&quot; birds--even if a range extends to the West. Both books show ranges that extend into Canada. The NG book is nifty because the little maps that appear in the back of the Petersen books are on the same page as the bird illustrations.<br />The birds illustrated in both books are clustered by category. For example, Petersen shows male and female Downey, Hairy, Northern Three-toed, and Black-backed woodpeckers together, as does the NG. The Petersen guide has little arrows that point to distinguishing marks, but NG does not. I find these indicator arrows very helpful when I am trying to tell two closely marked birds apart. The NG does show a tiny row of variants across the bottom of the page (For example, the woodpecker page = fasciatus, dosalis, orius, etc.)<br />The bird colors are less differentiated in the Peterson than the NG illustrations. For example, stripes on the Peterson Three-toed woodpecker's belly are less articulated than those shown on the NG bird. I don't think this matters as one seldom gets close enough to see the mottling. The Peterson birds are hand drawn and relatively flat, while the NG birds are more rounded, i.e. modeled. The Petersen birds look like the Audubon paintings. The NG illustrations remind me of digital photos of taxidermist stuffed birds (probably why the colors are so differentiated).<br />Both books provide measurements and Latin names. The Peterson book provides text that describes birds that might prove confusing with your bird of interest. The NG book provides text that describes the attributes of regional variants. This latter feature won't help you in the field since you almost never see regional variants in the same location.<br />If you are a serious bird watcher you will probably want both books and the Audubon and Smithsonian books as well. If you can only afford one book, I recommend the Peterson book. I have used my Peterson book for so long it just falls open when I hold it in one hand, so I am probably prejudiced.e so differentiated). <br />Both books provide measurements and Latin names.

It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it put me to sleep.  This is exactly the kind of book I like to read when I'm feeling lazy -- entertaining and not intellectually challenging. The main character is a young woman named Sidda who is involved in stagecraft along the lines of the author Rebecca Wells. She is also from LA like Ms. Wells. One wonders if the Mama depicted in YA-YA is anything like Ms. Wells own mother.<br />YA-YA is extremely funny in places and extremely sad in others and extremely boring whenever the scenes shift from the Ya-Yas. Anyone who has ever dealt with a substance abusing parent will probably be able to identify with some aspects of Sidda's plight. Those of us who had mothers who became our own Girl Scout leaders and who taught us how to build campfires and swim and sing will also be able to identify.<br />Ms. Wells has done a credible job of capturing life in LA, although her mise-en-scene is a bit thin in places. I also would have appreciated more character development. The characters act, but I do not have the sense that I understand their &quot;being&quot; at all--even Sidda.<br />The occult in the South is much bigger than Ms. Wells suggests. I wish she had spent less time describing the goings on in Sidda's life on stage and more time dealing with the magic she so successfully evokes in the first pages of her book. YA-YA had the potential to be the female eqivalent of MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL. The reader can obtain other perspectives on life in LA and goose bumps via the writing of Anne Rice.  Tim Gautreaux and Robert Penn Warren provide better poetry and grit.	2002-06-01

JEWISH AMERICANS is a big fat wonderful book filled with hundreds of photographs of native and foreign-born Jewish Americans. The book is coffee-table sized so if you want to start a conversation this is the book that will do it. You'll need an ovesized book shelf to store it.<br />Although most American Jews were born in the U.S., many were immigrants. Jews began settling in the U.S. when it was a collection of colonies over 300 years ago, and were participants in the American Revolution, the western expansion and all the other historical events which define who is American.<br />Some Jews came to the U.S. when Spain expelled the Jews from it's territories (convert, leave, or die). Some came to the U.S. from Europe following pogroms and other cruel efforts designed to eradicate Jews and Jewish life. Many came to the U.S. during and after WWII. Today, many Jews have fled areas where Muslim extremists make life difficult for all non-believers.<br />Jews can be of any race and are both Hispanic and not. Jews have come from Africa, Europe, Asia, and all points on the globe. As the historian Simon Schama says, 'Jews don't have roots, they have feet.' Records of the Jewish diaspora can be found in the Christian Bible, Jewish holy books, and Latin and other sources. In the 1st Century C.E. the Romans destroyed the temple in Jerusalem, but even that awful event has not prevented return migration to the homeland.<br />Jews in the U.S. (Freud went to London when he fled Vienna) have ranged from Louis Brandeis and Ruth Bader Ginsberg of the Supreme Court, Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve, Albert Einstein the physicist, and Drs. Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin who found a way to beat polio. Without Jewish performers, the U.S. would have been a  sad place during the 20th Century. These entertainers have included Irving Berlin who wrote 'White Christmas', George M. Cohen who wrote 'Yankee Doodle Dandy', George Gershwin who wrote 'An American in Paris', Oscar Hammerstein who wrote the lyrics to &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Okalahoma&quot;, Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, Isaac Stern, and Sandy Koufax the baseball player. Mathew Broderick, Mel Brooks, Barbara Streisand and many song and dance people are Jewish. The list of commedians, including Milton Berle, Steve Allen and Rose Ann, producers, directors, and folks working in theatre and films is astonishing.<br />Most Jews are not famous. Many of them or their ancestors fled Europe during the Nazi buildup and after WWII. As a result of their own persecution, the Jews have worked against the persecution of others. For example, although this book provides a rough idea of the number of Jews living in the U.S., the U.S. government does not publish an official number for Jews or Muslims or Christians. Various religious groups, including the Jews, worked hard to keep a question on religion off the U.S. Census forms because religious identity on government records has been used in the past to persecute people.wrote the lyrics to &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Okalahoma&quot;, Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, Isaac Stern, and Sandy Koufax the baseball player.

I did not enjoy MURDER IN BELLEVILLE as much as MURDER IN THE MARAIS. BELLEVILLE kept me reading until I reached its disappointing conclusion (like the optomistic kid looking for the pony in the room full of merde), but I had a difficulty keeping track of the convoluted storyline. There are too many Algerian factions. There are too many characters who keep coming and going. There are too many crises. The map in the paperback version did nothing to help me identify the many scenes of action. Perhaps the map in the hardcover is better, but I would not waste money on the hard cover. If you are going to the beach and plan to doze off while you read, this is not the book for you. If you are looking for good historical fiction this is not the book for you.<br />Although aspects of BELLEVILLE are reminiscent of LeCarre's novels of international intrigue, Black's tale is not as good. Aimee Leduc, the female protagonist encounters more danger in a single day than the average agent encounters in a year. The nature of her close calls boggle the imagination. My goodness --she stuggles out of the arms of a hit man who shoots her in the back, into the arms of a Siberian bear, down a feed chute, and is almost trampled by an elephant in the space of two pages.<br />Black appears to understand the Algerian and North African populations living in Paris. She describes their many faceted misogynist culture in interesting detail and links her storyline to real events such as the standoff in the Christian church by the &quot;sans papiers&quot; (illegal aliens) in the 1990s. I probably would have had more sympathy for their plight if I had read the book before Sept. 11. Now, it's difficult for me to feel any sympathy for those who break the law.	2002-05-27

There are at least two ways to view Ben Yagoda's book ABOUT TOWN: 1) as the history of The New Yorker Magazine, how it was conceived and developed and changed over time, and 2) as a social document reflecting its times. The subtitle of the book &quot;and the World it Made&quot; does not seem quite as accurate unless one considers that &quot;world&quot; to be the corporate culture created by the staff led by Ross and Shawn, the two longtime editors who built the magazine. The New Yorker certainly has influenced the world within which it existed along with many other magazines.<br />Harold Ross, the founder and first editor of the magazine, with the help of Katherine and E.B.White, Thurber, Dorothy Parker, and many other fine editors and writers launched the magazine in the 1920s. The sophisticated and literary focus of the magazine soon captured the fancy of New Yorkers. During the hard days of the depression the magazine actually gained subscribers as readers enjoyed the humorous repartee and cartoons that helped them laugh at their troubles. Many new readers learned of the magazine during WWII as it was  handed around the barracks. The GI bill produced many educated readers who remembering their wartime contact with the magazine now subscibed to it. Following WWII, the magazine included more and more &quot;social conscience&quot; articles, for example, John Hershey's essay on &quot;Hiroshima.&quot;<br />Ross died in the early 1950s, and during the fifties under the editorship of William Shawn, the magazine became relatively banal according to Yagoda who says it appealed to stay-at-home wives who enjoyed articles that reminded them of their college days (among other pieces, Mary McCarthy's tales of her Italian travels were featured). In the 1960s, the magazine once again became more vocal about social issues and the environment.<br />Yagoda says the best years of the magazine came in the 1970s when writers like Woody Allen wrote wonderful wacky pieces and investigative journalists covered the scandals in<br />Washington.  Following a downturn in subscriptions in 1980s, the magazine was purchased by a media mogul and William Shawn departed. With Tina Brown's arrival, the magazine metamorphed into a Conde Nast publication. Garrison Keillor's comments about Brown's arrival (as he left) are amusing.<br />Over the years, I have read John Updike, Alice Munro, Jamaica Kincaid, Katherine White, and many of the writers who once wrote for the New Yorker. When I was a child, my mother used to quote Dorothy Parker regularly (&quot;Rivers are damp...&quot;), but I had no idea Parker wrote for The New Yorker until years later (we lived in a rural area and subscribed to the Progressive Farmer!!). When I read Rachel Carson's SILENT SPRING, it changed my life, but I read it in book form when it was first published as a Book of the Month Club selection. I only became aware of The New Yorker magazine when I was in my thirties and a college writing instructor suggested it. Yagoda says many people discovered the magazine when they were students.<br />As a social document, The New Yorker articles very much reflect the times, and to some extent, at least under Ross, the magazine seemed to be ahead of the times. In reading this book, I was reminded of National Public Radio, which seems to be the main innovator in broadcast journalism these days--though I am told there are all sorts of happenings on the Internet. The in-depth news stories, the essays by various knowledgeable citizens, the political commentaries and Garrison Keilor are all comparable to The New Yorker magazine.<br />If you are interested in a snapshot of the 20th Century from an educated New Yorker magazine perspective, or in writing and magazine development in general, you will find much of interest in this book. The tales concerning the origins of many innovative features of the magazine are quite good.<br />Yagoda suggests the magazine pretty much ended with Shawn's departure in thelate 1980s. He devotes eight pages at the end of the book to the three editors who followed Shawn. He says the median age of the readership grows older every year (not replacing subscribers) and most of current readership as such is owing to the retention of loyal readers. He quotes some of these readers who no longer actually read the magazine but have not given up their subscriptions. His book goes a long way toward explaining to me why I dropped my subscription a few years ago.the late 1980s. He devotes eight pages at the end of the book to the three editors who followed Shawn.

One does not need a mathematical background to follow the narrative of J.L.Heilbron's THE SUN IN THE CATHEDRAL but a knowledge of high school geometry will probaly help. Dr. Heilbron was aware of the &quot;geometrically challenged&quot; reader when he developed his book and has written the text for the lay person. Heilbron received the Watson Davis Prize for Public Understanding of Science for his work DILEMMAS OF AN UPRIGHT MAN. The average reader without a fear of math should be able to follow the ABCs in the text and link them to the ABCs in the diagrams. It took me several weeks to read the text, not because it is so difficult, but because it is filled with information and I had to take breaks to absorb what I had read.<br />THE SUN IN THE CATHEDRAL is nothing less than the story of how the Christian Church parented modern science and technology. Although the ignorant will persist in accusing the Church of being a roadblock, the truth is that the impetus and sustenance of scientific exploration in the West came from the church, and although one might call it an unholy alliance, Christian ideology and Science have moved in lockstep ever since. Heilbron predicts that eventually Gallileo, who was sponsored by the Church, will be cannonized a saint.<br />Why does this happen? Dr. Rock who invented the modern birth control pill was Roman Catholic. He developed the pill to help RC women control their fertility in a manner acceptable to the Church that had to do with the timing of the release of the ova. His method was not accepted by the Church, but nevertheless the use of Rock's pill has led to falling birth rates in the U.S. and other Catholic countries (U.S. is 40 percent RC) and a subsequent decline in the poverty rates. (Economic development is important, but per capita household income is affected by fertility levels.) Maybe he will become a saint someday.<br />How did the Church become interested in the study of time? The means of communication were slow in the early days of the Church and this slowness led to a requirement for advance knowledge of the moveable feast dates which the Church passed on to its far-flung parishes. The problem of determining when these dates would occur lay with determining when Easter would occur. The moveable feasts of the Church year fall in accordance with Easter (i.e. Chistmas is a fixed date, Pentacost is a moveable feast that follows Easter by 40 days, Good Friday and Lent preceed Easter by a fixed numer of days. Easter is calculated relative to the Spring Equinox which is the point at which the day and the night (solar) are exactly equal.)<br />To address the problem of measuring the Spring Equinox, the church employed bright young men (like Gallileo) and gave them the resources they needed including church facilities. THE SUN IN THE CHURCH is their story and the story of those who followed them who were sponsored by the Reformed Church and Royalty of both RC and Reformed persuasion.<br />The book suggests that even as one problem was solved, yet another arose (you need the geometric diagrams to understand the intricacies of these problems as well as their solutions). First there was the problem of finding a structure large enough to create a BIG sundial, since sundials were useful for figuring out the length of the day. This led to the use of cathedrals and other very large public buildings where even today a numer of gnomen (little windows that admit sunlight) and meridians (sun dial like stuctures inside the building) can still be found. Inside these cathedrals, pillars and other obstacles had to be overcome and how this was done is ingenious.<br />Obstacles to the precision of measurment led to discussions about the height of the terrain where a building was situated, the thickness of the earth under the building (some sank), the shape of the earth (affected the location of the center or apex of the triangle of measurement), the distance of the moon from the earth and the sun, etc.,etc.<br />Most importantly, a discussion ensued about whether or not the world was heliocentric. If you start from a false premise such as the sun revolves around the earth, no matter how carefully you conduct your calculations the results will be wrong. The issue of heliocentricity proved a big stumbling block. In the end, the records of the scientists who said the earth moved about the sun were preserved (else Heilbron couldn't have written his book) but for a long time the Church held that the sun revolved around the earth, and anyone who said differently was speaking heretically. Some really funny compromises occurred, probably because intelligent church men knew they were not necessarily correct (some of the scientists were Jesuits or former clergy). And, at one point England and Italy were on two different calendars because the English refused to accept anything Rome devised, even if it was CORRECT!!.<br />The study of time led naturally to the study of space and both led to global explorations. The Jesuits (grey friars) traveled the globe and impressed their new converts with the science (magic) of the West. The Domincans came to the New World with the Conquistadors and recorded the science and magic of the inhabitants.<br />Protestants continued the tradition of exploration which led to the discovery of longitude. Seems the earth is not the same diameter every where. A team measuring the diameter of the earth in Peru was attacked by local Indians who thought the Europeans with sticks were lunatics or socerers. Ditto the Appenines in Italy. &quot;Who would think Italian countymen could behave like savages&quot; remarked one scientist. Geodetic surveys and even the GPS system in use today are descended from this research.<br />THE SUN IN THE CATHEDRAL is a fabulous book, and one every one who wants to gain a better understanding of the world around us should read. This book cancels the mistaken notion that the church tried to block science. This book is about how science and ideology interacted and framed the world we live in with &quot;Western&quot; ideas. And, as Heilbron points out, even in our so-called advanced state of knowledge censorship is alive and well. &quot;All of which will be unpleasantly familiar to observers of the operation of political correctness in contemporary universities.&quot; Reason and science are threatened today by a much more insidious enemy.., etc. <br />Most importantly, a discussion ensued about whether or not the world was heliocentric.

Charles Dudley Warner appears to have lived an enviable life. He was educated when most men did not have an opportunity to become educated.

His garden is located in Hartford at the edge of a game preserve. During the course of the summer, President Grant is in Hartford and stops by for a visit. As the men sit in Warner's yard, Grant says he can hardly wait to retire to his own garden as he is fed up with politics. Warner has been fighting pusley in his garden and he and Grant discuss the advantage of inviting immigrants who eat pusley and would soon rid the country of both problems.<br />Warner has various encounters with: hunters tracking quail who stray from the game preserve, one of whom claims he is looking for a lost chicken; small boys who eat berries from his vines and gather nuts from his trees; birds who attack his pea pods, the neighbor's hens who range too freely until he is looking for one to fill a pot; and the owner of a cow pastured in his yard. In spite of drought, theft, and green worms, at the end of the summer Warner is able to put aside enough vegetables to feel he has accomplished something and then his wife Polly takes credit for the work.<br />Of interest to me is that more than 100 years after Warner published his book, U.S. gardeners can still complain about some of the same things Warner complained about--and more. Most gardeners know that the U.S. has been infested with a whole array of pests and diseases that were not around when Warner gardened. For example, three new plagues including the Varroa mite have attacked American honey bees since the 1980s. Partly these attacks are owing to the introduction of containerized shipments that cannot be inspected and may hold verboten materials (plants, animals, insects). Partly these problems are owing to flagrant violations by individuals who believe U.S. laws concerning the transport of \\"foreign\\" plants do not apply to them. Warner's worries about green worms in his celery, witch grass in his potato hills, and pulsey seem mild in comparison.that were not around when Warner gardened.

MURDER IN THE MARAIS is a good read, so pack it up and take it with you on your transatlantic flight to Paris. I read it in about 6-7 hours. Cara Black provides a map of the Marais District in the front of the book so you can locate some of the action as you read.<br />The Marais is a picturesque area of old buildings and twisting narrow streets that frequently end in cul de sacs. Recently, the area has been undergoing gentrification. As Black points out, the Marais escaped the &quot;enlightenment&quot; phase of the 19th Century renovation of the City of Paris when whole blocks of the very old buildings lining the medieval network of streets were razed to create boulevards.<br />Once upon a time, the Marais was home for most of the Jews of Paris. When the Nazis arrived in the early 1940s, they began a systematic program of eliminating the Jewish population of Paris and France. As a result, a population that once numbered in the millions now numbers about 100,000. Most of these Jews died in the camps -- Bergen Belson, Treblinka, and elsewhere. Following the war, many of the survivors migrated to Israel or America.<br />Murder in the Marais involves the death of an elderly Jewish woman, Lili, who survived the Holocaust and continued to live hidden in the Marais like Anne Frank in Amsterdam until someone informed the Nazis. Aimee Leduc becomes involved with the death of Lili because she has been doing some investigative work for the association that tracks and captures ex-Nazis and Lili has been found with a Swastika carved on her forehead. Soon Leduc finds herself up against some of the nastiest sorts of people one can imagine -- Nazi werewolves who plan to regain power, whose motto is &quot;Unter den Linden&quot;, neo-Nazi skinheads who worship their Aryan forebears, and corrupt French officials.<br />Leduc is up to the challenge, however.  She is a gun-toting, cigar-smoking, joint-twisting, incredibly flexible gal who has more than one shoot-out, physical struggle, and fall from a high place through the course of the novel. If I didn't know better, I'd think Aimee Leduc was Stephanie Plum's cousin and this was New Jersey.<br />Excepting Leduc, Black's characters are fairly realistically if somewhat hyperactivally drawn. Certainly the neo-Nazis and Greens take their politics very seriously. In Paris, whether one uses sucre a la droite (white sugar) or sucre a la gauche (brown sugar) can get you killed. Also very important is how you draw your swastika.le, and fall from a high place through the course of the novel.

I don't know much about Czech literature, so I don't know if the Prague Spring had anything to do with the writing of Karel Capek, but I would not be surprised to discover a connection. &quot;Leaves wither because spring is already beginning, because new buds are being made, as tiny percussion caps out of which the spring will crack....if we could only see that secret swarming of the future within us, we should say that our melancholy and distrust is silly and absurd and that the best thing of all is to be..living..&quot;<br />Karel Capek wrote those words in 1929 when he was 39 years old. By 1938, the year the Nazis invaded Prague, he was dead. His brother Josef died a few years later in Bergan-Belsen. But this book is not about those sad events. This book is about a year in the life of a good gardener, how ever extraordinary a writer he might have been.<br />During his lifetime, Capek realized that humans were becoming enslaved by fascism and run-amuck technology. The ancient and cyclical daily practices of humans were dying before his eyes --the beet farmers stacking their fall harvests at the railroad stations; the wagon loads of manure that could be delivered for  garden beds; the nursury men who understood plants giving way to &quot;market garden centers&quot; staffed by those who regularly misidentify plants and stocked with items that &quot;move&quot; (produce a high volume of sales).<br />THE GARDENER'S YEAR is a reflective book. You don't have to garden to appreciate it, but if you garden, you will probably laugh on more than one occasion. Where is the gardener who has not struggled with a hose; Who has not looked with greed on a bald spot and attempted to squeeze six more phlox plants in, only to discover a dormant sping plant; And, where is the gardener who has not wandered about the yard with a plant in each hand trying to find just one more place for a perennial. Capek understood the gardener's soul. We are a greedy lot, obsessed with dirt, happy in a wagon load of s___, and hostile to many-legged life forms, but, we are also the best sort of human beings who understand the meaning and importance of life.<br />Capek's writing reminds me of that of Henry Mitchell who wrote two columns (one on gardening the other on &quot;everyday&quot; philosophy) for the Washington Post. Like Mitchell Capek had the gift of converting his own gardening experiences into tales that inform, enlighten, and illustrate the best and the worst of human nature. &quot;I tell you there is no death, not even sleep. We only pass from one season to another. We must be patient with life, for it is eternal.&quot;a wagon load of s___, and hostile to many-legged life forms, but, we are also the best sort of human beings who understand the meaning and importance of life.<br />Capek's writing reminds me of that of Henry Mitchell who wrote two columns (one on gardening the other on &quot;everyday&quot; philosophy) for the Washington Post.

Bernard Lewis is an expert on his topic (Professor of Near Eastern Studies Emeritis at Princeton) and he has received much praise for his work. WHAT WENT WRONG is a distillation of material found in his earlier books, including A SHORT HISTORY OF THE MIDDLE EAST.<br />Historians frequently use one of several questions as organizing principles for their research -- what happened? what worked? what went wrong? Lewis book title is taken from the last question -- one that educated Middle Easterners are currently asking themselves. If you think the turmoil in the Middle East indicates something is wrong, then Lewis' book may interest you.<br />WHAT WENT WRONG is not perfect, but you will be able to identify the causes of the current problems in the Middle East if you read this book carefully. For example, on page 157 Lewis says there are those who suggest that &quot;..the main culprit is Muslim sexism, and the relegation of women to an inferior position in society, thus depriving the Islamic world of the talents and energies of half its people, and entrusting the crucial early years of the upbringing of [children] to illiterate and downtrodden mothers.&quot; Boys raised by these mothers are arrogant and girls are submissive. These arrogant males and downtrodden females produce too many children which leads to extreme poverty.<br />Lewis says the problems in the Middle East were not caused by the European powers, nor Israel. The problems in the Middle East are the result of following Islamic practices that prohibit the adaptation of Western ways including the enfranchisement of women. The problems in the Middle East will never be solved until the people adapt democratic processes and modern technology (i.e. birth control!!!).	2002-05-07

In FROM BEIRUT TO JERUSALEM, Thomas Freidman likens the well in the nave of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, that marks the place where Jesus is thought to have been born, to the \\"naval\\" of the world. Although Freidman is Jewish, he apparently understands that Christians see the Holy Land as the beginning and the end--the alpha and the omega. Even Christians who say they are \\"fallen away\\" or secular feel a connection to the land and its people.<br />Friedman's book was published in 1989 and concentrates on the years 1967 to 1987. The book tells the story of his two journeys--a physical journey from Minnesota to Beirut to Jerusalem to Washington DC--and a spiritual and psychological journey from adolescent boy with a crush on storybook land to mature man in love with a nation state.<br />Unlike Friedman, I was not captivated by the Jews and Israel in 1967 (although Moyshe Dayan was a hero I could appreciate). I was captivated in the 1950s by with \\"Exodus\\" and \\"The Ten Commandments\\" and \\"The Story of Ruth\\" and other heroic tales produced by Jewish directors and producers. Jewish movie makers played a major role in the moral education of Americans regarding the wrongness of racism as anyone who has ever seen \\"Gentleman's Agreement\\" or \\"Guess Whose Coming to Dinner\\" knows.<br />I think Freidman provides as balanced a version of the events in Beirut and Jerusalem in the 1980s as anyone can. He is Jewish and his story is autobiographical but he is very forthcoming about his feelings throughout the book. This book is not \\"objective\\" news reporting in the strictest sense, although his articles in the New York Times may have been more so. Not all Jewish readers agree with him either. As he says, we all have \\"supermyths\\" that shape the way we see the truth and we each interpret the truth differently.<br />Freidman lays out what he says are the four major perspectives of the people of Israel about Israel--what it is and what it should become and/or remain. Apparently, there is no consensus. Points of view range from the secular Jews who see Israel as a haven or sanctuary following thousands of years of oppression, and who are not as obsessed with where the boundaries are as much that they are fixed and secure. On the other hand, the Messanic Jews think the boundaries of the modern Israel must match those of the historic Israel. And then there are in-between viewpoints.<br />Another aspect of Friedman's book that I appreciated discusses the \\"Hama Rules\\" of Middle Eastern Tribal warfare (think Machivelli). The West expects Israel to behave like a model citizen and follow the \\"civilized\\" rules of warfare while tribal terrorists who follow the Hama rules of warfare blow up innocents without a second thought.<br />Friedman says he thinks many Western journalists are perverse in their coverage of Israel. These journalists go out of their way to focus on Israeli misbehavior and look the other way when far worse events occur (and he provides plenty of examples). ... So much for objective reporting. He says the journalists and newspapers that report these biased stories have ulterior motives which he attempts to explain.  And, he says Arafat is the master of exploitation when it comes to Western journalists.<br /> ... When he left Beirut and arrived in Jerusalem he was amazed to find similarities between the two--suicide bombers, identity cards, loss of civil rights. His description of life in Israel following the inception of the 1987 Intifada sounded uncomfortably familiar.ly, there is no consensus.

WHITE OF A DIFFERENT COLOR by Matthew Frye Jacobson is an excellent historical summary and deconstruction of the social construct called &quot;the white race.&quot; Anthropologists, sociologists, demographers, and historians like Jacobson who study race and ethnicity have suggested over and over that even if race differences exist they are not fixed (the definition of white has changed over time and no consensus has been formed concerning it's constiuent parts). The biological sciences provide no evidence that race exists. Humans with different hair color, skin color, eye color, eye shape, and/or other &quot;race&quot; characteristics straddle all the &quot;race&quot; groups.<br />Jacobson uses a variety of written sources to make his case --that &quot;non-Anglo-Saxon immigrants and their children were perhaps the first beneficiaries of the modern civil rights movement.&quot; He has compiled evidence from many historical legal cases involving various individuals who attempted to establish evidence of &quot;whiteness&quot; in order to obtain U.S. citizenship or some other perq reserved for the &quot;native white race.&quot; He points out that the legal evidence is conflicted. Are Armenians white or aren't they? How can Japanese with a white skin be nonwhite and Italians with a dark skin be white in one set of court proceedings and the reverse found in different courts on different days?<br />Jacobson includes information from literature, news journals, and other written sources to illustrate that authors as diverse as Mark Twain and Joseph Conrad and Mr. Hearst of newspaper fame all offered an opinion about race at one time or another, and that while everyone started out assuming they knew what it meant to be white, most soon discovered the operational definition was another matter. There is not now nor ever has been a consensus on what it means to be white.<br />I enjoyed Jacobson's book very much and I think it is an excellent qualitative analysis. However, I have a few concerns:  1) Race is a contentious topic, but mixed race is even more troublesome. In 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau identified more than 60 race groups in the U.S.; While Jacobson alludes to this issue, he might have discussed it a bit more as it supports his idea that race is a nebulous notion; 2) In discussing the acquisition of civil rights, Jacobson makes the mistake many men make--Black men had the vote and basic rights many years before women of any color; 3) Jacobson begins his history with 1790 and assumes (as did many) that the so-called Anglo-Saxons were a monolithic group--they were not. The early settlers were a diverse lot from many nations and included landed gentry, endentured servents, and prisoners who worked side by side with slaves in Georgia and other colonial penal colonies until the Revolution. I have read that Jews funded the Revolotion, Poles and French trained the military (a highway in VA is named for general Pulaski); and that the first person to die in the Revolution was a free Black man named Crispus Attucks. 4) Jacobson starts the civil rights movement with the acceptance of &quot;non-white&quot; immigrants to &quot;white&quot; privilege, but evidence suggests that the U.S. Revolution was about the rights of the property owners or Aristocracy. Not until Andrew Jackson did the &quot;common&quot; man get the vote. Black men got the vote 30 years later and women got the vote in the 1920s although many rights were not accorded them until recently.

I saw Robert Baer on CNN last night and he said he thinks the CIA is improving.  He says the agency has finally realized it cannot carry out it's mission without field operatives. He says, however, it will take five years to train agents to operate in places like the Middle East. Apparenly, agents cannot get the hang of things overnight. The gist of SEE NO EVIL is that for years, the agency moved in the wrong direction--relying almost exclusively on technology and less and less on human contact. Baer left the CIA in 1997 and was working as a &quot;consultant&quot; last summer in Lebanon when he heard something was afoot. It seems the folks in Washington preferred to look the other way and see no evil--hence Sept. 11. Baer says on that dreadful day, the FBI, CIA, INS, and plenty of others failed. A small band of fellow citizens on a plane flying over PA saved Washington.  (The Pentagon is in South Arlington--and as it happens--a few blocks from my house where I stood and watched black smoke rise into the sky. Although the Pentagon was damaged, the damage would have been far worse if the plane had crossed the river, because the Pentagon is constructed of reinforced concrete. Experts think the plane that crashed in PA was headed for DC. Two of my work colleagues were on that flight--Federal workers.)<br />Since I work for a Federal agency, I can certainly identify with some of the bureacratic struggles Mr. Baer experiences. However, there are ways to get things done, and Mr. Baer himself shows how he managed to do so on more than one occasion. First you have to give up the idea of rapid advancement. Bureacracies don't reward risk-taking. Baer skated on thin ice more than once because he made the decision that he had to live with his own conscience. His his final citation (awarded to him without his knowledge) says, &quot;He repeatedly put himself in personal danger, working the hardest targets, in service to his country.&quot;<br />This is not poppycock. Plenty of career Feds take their jobs very seriously and love the country as much as Mr. Baer. Many have made sacrifices and been sacrificed, and not always for a good cause. Many like Baer have become whistle blowers. Unfortunately, whistle blowers are often seen as &quot;bad&quot; because they upset the status quo and force all of us to face reality. In a land where indulgence and fanasy entertainment rule, many people don't want to be reminded of that evil is real.<br />Many of our elected officials and appointees are narrowly focused on career advancement, shortsighted and care only about what happens during their watch, and can hardly contain themselves as they prepare for the next election, the next big job, the next salary increase. But don't throw the baby out with the bath water, there are good guys in Washington. Some of them are elected officials like John McCain and John Kerry. Some are appointed like Donald Rumsfield. Many are career civil servents like Mr. Baer.<br />Robert Baer's book reads like a John LeCarre thriller and I enjoyed it so much I had to slap myself in the face and say, you dummy, this is the real thing, THIS IS NOT FICTION. These guys really get killed--like Michael Spann. I hope the CIA uses the book as part of its recruitment package.<br />The sad fact is that the U.S. has been wounded over and over and failed to act to stop terrorism. When you add up all the insults and injuries as Baer has done the truth is overwhelming: the hostages, the murders and assainations, the capture and/or destruction of U.S. and other embassies, the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, Black Hawk down, the military quarters in Yemen, the U.S.S. Cole, the airline crashes and hijackings, and hundreds of other incidents including the Sept. 11 disasters. Our so-called leaders have been asleep at the switch--too interested in partying and/or shagging an intern in the cloak room. Alcohol, drugs, and illicit sex are a problem in Washington DC.<br />But worst of all is sheer incompetance. As Baer puts it, each administration handed the problem along to the next without really addressing it--the not on my watch syndrome. Clinton seems to have been especially concerned with donations to his campaign war chest than to doing the job he was elected to do. Baer says the Bush Sr. and Reagan administrations could have done more too. Unfortunately, the latter was too concerned with the Cold War to notice the hot war. All of them were not up to the job--yet they were elected, some of them more than once. And don't think BIG OIL arrived with the current President Bush. One can trace the tracks of BIG OIL and big business back to JFK. Ike warned U.S. citizens of the miltary industrial complex--it's other name is oil.<br />Baer says we are at war, and the war will be difficult to win. The ignorant have already taken to the streets to protest. But what is the alternative? In 1971, I was thrown out of a military commisary for wearing pants--I know I would not survive a Muslim regime.ncompetance.

1572862:US	51379338	R8U5T2SFK9916	0684807122	837753671	The Middle East:  A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years	Books	4	40	43	N	N	Well written and interesting....	THE MIDDLE EAST by Bernard Lewis is extremely well written, but  footnotes and references are few, so if you want history that serves as a basis for further investigation you may be disappointed. The book is very readable, however, so I decided to treat it as a New Yorker type article (the long ones in the back of the magazine) and enjoyed it very much.<br />The book includes much interesting material and many wonderful anectdotes. For example, I found the story of Saladin fascinating--he was a probably a Muslim Kurd--not an Arab. Also, according to Lewis, the Crusades were a miserable attempt by the Europeans to &quot;copy&quot; the Muslim Jihad which the Arabs had been waging successfully for sometime before the first Crusade.<br />THE MIDDLE EAST includes a plethora of detail, yet not all topics are well covered. Although the introduction suggests Lewis will provide adequate coverage of the period from the 1st to the 7th Centuries, he provides only a bare synopsis of this Christian period (Latin or Orthodox) and barely covers the Jews at all. However, this is a vast improvement since most other &quot;experts&quot; begin with the Crusades which is comparable to a history of the U.S. Civil War that begins with Gettysburg.<br />Readers who want to understand the history of Palestine will find plenty of material. Apparently, following the partition of the old Ottoman Empire after WWI, the British acquired the governance of the area known as Palestine and TransJordan. The Romans had renamed Judaea--the land of the Jews---Palestine--the land of the Phillistines--at the time of their last attempt to eradicate the Jews (when the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed). The Arabs called the area other names, but when the British took over they used the old Latin name.<br />Jews have always lived in the Holy Land (they returned after every exile) and during the Arab conquest they actually lived in relative peace. As &quot;people of the book&quot; they were not treated as harshly as pagans and other non-Jews and non-Christians. Jews returned to the Holy Land in large numbers in the 16th Century during the Spainish exile, and continued to come from all over Europe through the 20th Century when they migrated following persecution in Russia, Germany, France, etc. Although many were killed during WWII, thousands managed to make it to the Holy Land. During the Israeli-Arab wars, hundreds of thousands of Jews exiled from other parts of the Middle East migrated to Israel. Lewis suggests that the largest refugee population in the world lives in Israel--where most people are refugees, or the children or grandchildren of refugees. While Israel accepted the Jews expelled from all over the world, Arab countries, excepting Jordan, did not reciprocate and accept Palestinian refugees from Israel--why many remain stateless.<br /><br />Muslims are the dominant force in the Middle East, but their early history is not well known. Lewis pieces together his version which seems to be based on Muslim religious writing --comparable to the Old Testament history of the Jews or the New Testament history of Christians. I wondered why Lewis did not use more material from the Roman or Byzantine administrative and historical records (or cite Sir JJ Norwich or Dr. John Fine).<br />Lewis discusses all aspects of life in the Middle East over the past two thousand years--religion, politics, economy, etc. The great puzzle is how did the Muslims with such a rich inheritance from several advanced ancient civilizations (Greece, Mesopotamia, Egypt) end up losing their competitive edge to &quot;infidel&quot; Europeans by the 17th Century?

Jews returned to the Holy Land in large numbers in the 16th Century during the Spainish exile, and continued to come from all over Europe through the 20th Century when they migrated following persecution in Russia, Germany, France, etc. Although many were killed during WWII, thousands managed to make it to the Holy Land. During the Israeli-Arab wars, hundreds of thousands of Jews exiled from other parts of the Middle East migrated to Israel. Lewis suggests that the largest refugee population in the world lives in Israel--where most people are refugees, or the children or grandchildren of refugees. While Israel accepted the Jews expelled from all over the world, Arab countries, excepting Jordan, did not reciprocate and accept Palestinian refugees from Israel--why many remain stateless.  <BR> <BR>Muslims are the dominant force in the Middle East, but their early history is not well known. Lewis pieces together his version which seems to be based on Muslim religious writing --comparable to the Old Testament history of the Jews or the New Testament history of Christians. I wondered why Lewis did not use more material from the Roman or Byzantine administrative and historical records (or cite Sir JJ Norwich or Dr. John Fine).  <br />Lewis discusses all aspects of life in the Middle East over the past two thousand years--religion, politics, economy, etc. The great puzzle is how did the Muslims with such a rich inheritance from several advanced ancient civilizations (Greece, Mesopotamia, Egypt) end up losing their competitive edge to &quot;infidel&quot; Europeans by the 17th Century? Lewis suggests the answer lies in the unwillingness of the Muslims to embrace change which apparently they view as evil. Certainly the Europeans seem to have turned the tables on a once brilliant society which faltered after the reign of Sulyman the Magnificent.	2002-04-20

I garden year round, am a photographer of sorts, and I collect garden and art books. THE SENSUOUS GARDEN by Monty Don is a new kind of book with a fresh approach to garden photography, one that takes the viewer up-close-and-personal and arouses the five senses as well as what Don calls the sixth sense or intuition. I don't know if my intuition is involved, but Don's photographs affect my various senses and the whole effect is greater than the sum of the parts. This is a beautiful book filled with beautiful pictures.<br />In a few instances, Don has photographed places I know (gardens in Spain) but all of his photos have been taken from a unique angle which pinpoints the essence of the thing photographed. Too often, photos are taken with the frame of reference in mind..i.e. the frame. Don's photos are so physical I can hear the tinkling bells and falling water. I can taste the juicy fruit. I can touch the soft rust and white bib of the bluebird. I've seen bluebirds before, as many as five at one time. They are clever and quick and flit away before I can retrieve my camera. But Mr. Don got the photo I wanted. I can only marvel, and sit and enjoy the bluebird a while longer.	2002-04-13

MYTHS TO LIVE BY consists of a dozen essays/talks Joseph Campbell prepared between 1961 and 1971. He described the period as a \\"new age\\" where \\"..we are...participating in one of the very greatest leaps of the human spirit to a knowledge not only of outside nature but also of our own deep inward mystery.\\"<br />At the time he wrote these essays, Campbell was a professor on a campus, surrounded by young people whom he found hard to understand at times. For example, in his essay \\"The Moon Walk--the Outward Journey\\" he relates his own feelings of awe on viewing the Apollo moon landing and contrasts them with the reaction of a student who wrote \\"So What\\" on a photo of the moon landing posted on a campus bulletin board. In another essay \\"Schizophrenia--the Inward Journey\\" he contrasts the use of mind-altering drugs by shamans and psychotics (including the LSD induced version) as the difference between divers and non-swimmers in \\"the waters of the unviersal archetypes of mythology.\\"<br />I find Campbell's essays are very relevant, 30 years later. The most obvious example is \\"Mythologies of War and Peace\\" which addresses the underlying belief systems of participants in the Mideast crises. Campbell says the cruel fact is that \\"killing is the precondition of all living whatsoever: life lives on life, eats life, and would not otherwise exist...it is the nations, tribes, and peoples bred to mythologies of war that have survived to communicate their life-supporting mythic lore to descendents.\\" He suggests that \\"we\\" in the West \\"have been bred to one of the most brutal war mythologies of all time.\\" He then goes on to cite Deuteronomy and Isaiah and follows with excerpts from the Koran such as Sura 2, verse 216..\\"Fighting is prescribed for you.\\"<br />Campbell does not condemn myths nor does he say myths are not literally true. He suggests creation myths and myths about love and war and peace contain the essence of the truth. Myths are to humans what kangaroo pouches are to baby kangaroos, they provide a \\"womb with a view.\\" Being born simply isn't enough. We need myths to help us organize and guide our lives. However, our current myths arose in another era and were shaped by tribal mentalities that sustain the notion of GROUP differences. We need new myths for the journey of life.kangaroos, they provide a \\"womb with a view.\\" Being born simply isn't enough. We need myths to help us organize and guide our lives.

Chase is an old woman, trying to outrace her &quot;misbehaving&quot; heart, scribbling away on loose leaf notepaper day after day, transcribing her thoughts, documenting her daily doings, remembering the past. She wants to leave behind a legacy of sorts, an explanation of her life for her grandaughter Sabrina from who she is estranged.<br />Atwood publishes a book every few years and I have read all of them except THE HANDMAID'S TALE (lacking in courage I suppose). I never cease to be impressed with her talent and dexterity as a writer, and the beauty of her written words. As I have aged, her books have kept pace with my development or lack thereof. She speaks to me, saying things I think (do you really want someone going through your things when you die?) and expressing feelings I feel (who does not grieve?)<br />She raised my consciousness with LIFE BEFORE MAN, made me laugh with LADY ORACLE, fed my need for the mystical with ALIAS GRACE, and helped me put old resentments to rest with CAT'S EYE. Now as I enter what the insurance companies describe as the &quot;high risk&quot; years, she arrives with THE BLIND ASSASSIN to help me put my house of memories in order.<br />Atwood says, &quot;Happiness is a garden walled with glass: there's no way in and no way out. In paradise there are no stories, because there are no journeys.&quot; On earth our lives are stories with a beginning a middle and an end. If you truly live you must love, and if you love, sooner or later the blind assassin rips out your heart and you become--says Iris--a hard-boiled egg with a missing yolk.<br />There are two main stories, one &quot;tale&quot; and a few asides in THE BLIND ASSASSIN. The silly sci-fi incident referred to by another reviewer is a toss-away tale, not the crux of either of the two main stories or the tale. The primary story is Iris's somewhat deconstructed autobiography. Most of the action in her chronicle takes place in the 1930s and early 1940s just prior to and during WWII and concerns her childhood and early adult years with her sister Laura.<br />For a while, you may not know who is telling the second story interwoven through Iris' tale, as it has been written in the third person. This story is lyrical and absolutely haunting --reminscent of the poetic writing in the THE ENGLISH PATIENT. The second story takes place during the same period as the first. &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot; is also the title of a tale constructed by one of the characters for the amusement of another. This latter piece reminds me of one of Scherazade's tales set in an exotic place in Western Asia.<br />Does God have a left hand? Laura asks. In French left is mal or bad. How can God have a bad hand. But man is made in God's image and men have left hands so God must have a left hand. But who would sit on God's left or bad hand? Maybe God sits at a round table says Iris and everyone sits on his right.e. The primary story is Iris's somewhat deconstructed autobiography.

In BRIGHT EARTH, Philip Ball says, in the early 20th Century, Louis Vauxcelles, the art critic, on viewing Florentine-inspired sculptures standing in the midst of an exhibit of paintings that included the works of Matisse, Kandinsky, Braque, and others of their ilk is reported to have said, &quot;Look, Donatello in a cage of wild beasts&quot; (dans la cage aux fauves)--giving this group of artists the sobriquet by which they are known. Vauxcelles comment was prompted by his reaction to what he perceived to be an enthusiastic use of colors. Ball says the Fauvists were inspired by Van Gogh and Gauguin--the late impressionists, and in turn they inspired Picasso and the modern art movement of the 20th Century which Ball says was largely driven by color.<br />I had read Vauxcelles' comment elsewhere, but in Ball's retelling, the quip makes complete sense. The cages are the framed canvases. The colors are wild like the exotic beasts brought to Europe from faraway places. These colors were virtually unknown before the late 19th Century and the rise of the petrochemical industry. Like Van Gogh and Gauguin before and Picasso after the Fauvists used these pigments in unnatural ways.<br />Generally, art histories divert one into a discussion about lighting, atmosphere, iconography, brush stokes, or composition. Color is discussed but usually as an adjunct or afterthought. In BRIGHT EARTH, color IS the organizing principle--and it makes all the difference. The light in Monet's boating scene bounces off the water because the waves are composed of tiny flecks of violet and yellow. Van Gogh's Sunflowers have the tone they do because he liked to experiment with color and he used an unstable lemon-yellow pigment that has deteriorated over time. Rembrandt was brilliant not only because he created classic compositions and used deft brush strokes to do so, but because he understood how to use pigments that would stand the test of time.<br />What is color? I once visited a museum in Chicago which had an interior room filled with white canvases. Each canvas may have had a small black mark on it, I don't remember. What I remember is a completely white room which was supposed to be devoid of stimulation--but I found the room very stimulating. Is white a color or isn't it? Ball debates both sides of this argument. I find it amusing that over the millenia, artists, weavers, and other have found the non-color white one of the most difficult colors to acquire. Ball says that at the end of the 20th Century, the nine-volume publication entitled, &quot;Color Index International&quot;, includes 9,000 pages of &quot;colorants&quot; and the pigment produced in the greatest numbers is white. White is the most &quot;widely preferred veneer for our synthethic environment.&quot; One has only to think of paper towels, napkins, toliet paper, toothpaste, bread, and a variety of material goods that are made white so that consumers will buy them.<br />BRIGHT EARTH is an incredible and comprehensive book covering painting from Altimira to Hockney, pigments from Madder Red to Cadmium Red, art works from Greek vases to Miro tapestries, and chemicals from organics such as Woad and Indigo, to the enamels used by artists who no longer can be divided into categories such as scuplter, painter, weaver. Ball has skillfully handled a plethora of complex material. He is an incredibly well organized researcher and this is a well written book.<br />I have only one criticism of Ball's book. In his effort to concentrate on color relative to the visual arts of painting, photography, and print making, he has failed to include much material about textiles (some, but it won't be enough if this is your medium), and he virtually omits discussion of ceramics and pottery, and garden design. Because of this, he cannot clearly frame the future of art which most assuredly will include both visual and tactile dimensions. In Ball's defense, if he had covered these other arts his book would have been 9,000 pages long and filled nine volumes.e been 9,000 pages long and filled nine volumes.	2002-03-30

The U.S. Census Bureau indicates that about 88 percent of U.S. residents who identified as \\"Asian\\" in 2000 were foreign born (61 percent) or the children of one or two foreign born parents (27 percent). The vast majority of Asians resident in the U.S. arrived in the U.S. or were born after 1990. It should come as no surprise that some Americans view some Asians curiously, especially those who wear interesting clothing.<br />Professor Hu suggests that the \\"well being\\" of Asians is a myth, but government surveys indicate the opposite is true. Three factors sociologists use to measure social status (highly correlated with well being) are education, occupation and income. In 2000, the Current Population Survey revealed that 45 percent of the foreign-born from Asia over age 25 had completed a B.A. compared with 26 percent of the natives. About 40 percent of the foreign-born from Asia were working in higher paying professional jobs, compared with 31 percent of natives. Households with foreign-born Asian householders had a median income of $51,000, compared with $41,000 for U.S. natives.<br />Although it might not be their \\"mother tongue\\" most Asian foreign born speak English. Foreign-born Asians who migrated from Africa, Canada, Hong Kong, etc. generally speak English quite well. Many of Asian foreign born attended university in the States before adjusting status to legal permanent resident. Many Chinese students attending college in America were protected by the U.S. government when China demanded their return home and have since become legal immigrants.<br />According to the 2000 Census, people of Asian heritage have migrated from India, China, Phillipines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Africa, Europe, Canada, Latin America and Australia -- in other words from all over the world not just the Asian land mass. Many are a mixture of European and Asian. Asians and Whites have a high rate of intermarriage.<br />The General Social Survey conducted by the University of Chicago indicates that people of Asian extraction are Roman Catholic and Vietnamese, Roman Catholic and Filipino, Chinese and Methodist, Indian and Hindu or Sikh, Indonesian and Muslim, and many other combinations. Simple generalizations about \\"Asians\\" are very very misleading.<br />Some problems remain for some refugees from Asia as elsewhere, but most problems for legal permanent immigrants will be resolved over time. On the other hand, thousands of Chinese foreign born have been smuggled into the U.S. across the Canadian border. These illegal aliens do indeed experience dire conditions and many are deported.<br />Mr Wu has complained about his treatment at the airport, but since Sept. 11, even middle class grandmothers and Senators are being frisked. My son (who is mixed race) carries a U.S. Navy passport, frequently flies commercial air on military business, and has been subjected multiple searches.

For years, I ignored the Tarot because I thought it was a frivolous card game and that material written about it was cultish at worst and childish at best. It did not help that Tarot cards on the market were manufactured by American Games. I became interested in the Tarot cards because Bill Moyers interviewed Joseph Campbell, and as Moyers had never struck me as a kook, I thought perhaps Campbell was worth getting to know. Getting to know Campbell led me to TAROT REVELATIONS.<br />Much of my formal education concerns the social sciences including ethnography and the study of religion, myths, belief systems, etc. As a professional social scientist in a job that deals with ethnic issues, I have struggled to operationally define and measure ethnicity, and view cultural elements including myths as the basis of belief systems around which various ethnic groups organize their societies. I have arrived at the conclusion that most of the smaller systems are doomed, but fortunately, anthropologists and others have recorded enough material that we may still study the myths of our ancestors. Joseph Campbell points the way.<br />Mark Twain is purported to have said, don't let school get in the way of your education. Like Twain, Campbell--a highly educated man and a college professor--was able to break out of the mold of formal education and develop a fresh viewpoint concerning the world and what makes it tick. In other words, he was able to get past the mental censorship of academe.<br />In TAROT REVELATIONS, Campbell takes a leaf from Sir James Frazier's book 'The Golden Bough' and suggests a core set of concepts underlie all belief systems. He suggests Jungian psychologists have their own terms for these mythical elements which Jung recognized ages ago. As an empirical test of his idea that mythical elements have universal meanings, he compares the Tarot cards of the Major Arcana with the works of Dante and notes their similarities. He also demonstates how the cards can be used to illustrate the &quot;ideal life, lived virtuously according to the knightly codes of the Middle Ages.&quot;<br />In the remainder of the book, Richard Roberts, a student of Campbell, shows how the cards reflect the various mythological belief systems of historical peoples in the ancient world--Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, Keltoi, Iberians, etc. Roberts uses a deck designed about 100 years ago by A.E.Waite, a member of a group interested in arcane matters that included many illustrious members including W.B.Yeats. Waite did not invent the cards, he merely redesigned them using historical sources such as Tarot decks from the Middle Ages. Waite hired Pamela Coleman, an artist and fellow New Dawn member to illustrate the cards. Coleman, a Jamaican by birth with occult interests of her own was later &quot;discovered&quot; by Afred Stigliz who arranged for a showing of her works in New York City.<br />Roberts compares the elements in the Tarot deck with various myth based and arcane systems including alchemy, astrology, and Hermetic teaching. The Tarot deck is absolutely loaded with connections to all these systems. One could argue that some very educated folks constructed this deck, but the elements of the Tarot cards are recorded back to the mid-1300s thanks to Church Inquisitors who took an interest in the Cathars. Folks in the 1300s did not have had the expertise required to &quot;construct&quot; the cards from scratch because the cards reflect the heavens (arrangement of constellations, solstices, equinoxes, etc.) in about 2000 B.C.E. No one in the 1300s understood astronomy well enough to deduce how the heavens might have looked 3500 years earlier and if s/he did they sure kept it hidden--as in occult knowledge. Since Europeans in the 1300s were struggling with establishing the dates for the moveable feasts (they could not figure out when Easter would come 10 years hence) it strikes me that if anyone could have provided an answer they would have provided an answer--depending on how they felt about the church.<br />Information about the heavens between 4,000 and 2,000 B.C.E. can be found in the ruins of the ancient world--Stonehenge, the Azetec temples, the Pyramids so there is a great deal of evidence that the ancients understood their moment in time. Events moved too slowly for them to understand that 4,000 years after they lived the spring equinox would not fall in the sign of Taurus. However, Roberts suggests the ancient Persians figured out many things about the heavens and incorporated this knowledge into their belief systems.  After all, those Magi who found Christ were onto something. Much of the knowledge of ancient Persia was locked away in Constantinople to be discovered years later by prying minds.<br />So, the Tarot cards are very old because the knowledge in them is very old. The Tarot cards represent the distilled knowledge of ancient peoples including the Persians who had a Mithraic code that still manifests itself in Zoroastrianism today (number one religion on Islam's hit list in Iran). Archeologists have long argued diffusion versus spontaneous theories regarding the spread of cultural elements including creation tales. Roberts does not take sides, but suggests the information in the cards could support either view point. Whether the information captured in the Tarot cards was discovered by many people in different places at different times or in one place and later spread across the world does not matter. The truth is, humans have been stuggling with the meaning of life for a long time, and while no one has the final answer the Tarot cards are a leading competitor.n answer--depending on how they felt about the church. <br />Information about the heavens between 4,000 and 2,000 B.C.E. can be found in the ruins of the ancient world--Stonehenge, the Azetec temples, the Pyramids so there is a great deal of evidence that the ancients understood their moment in time.

I've been reading WITCHCRAFT AND MAGIC IN EUROPE edited by Bengt Ankarloo and Stuart Clark and have found the series incredibly informative. Although some may stumble over the text owing to the arcane demands of scholorship, as \\"text books\\" go, these works are the best. I may be biased as I never seem to tire of the subject of magic (what is it anyway??) especially when it is intelligently and objectively discussed. I also think anyone who truly wants to understand the connections between modern Christianity and Paganism must read these books as they combine information from written texts, including theological works, with archeology. You simply can't discuss witchraft and magic in Europe without reference to Chistianity--particularly the Roman Catholic Church. I feel these authors are very objective, but that may be because they recognize there was something very different about Jesus compared with the other magi of the ancient world.<br />'Ancient Greece and Rome' contains four scholarly essays. The first, by Daniel Ogden of the University of Wales in Swansea, covers \\"Binding Spells, Curse Tablets and Voodoo Dolls in the Greek and Roman World.\\" Ogden investigates the cache of curse tablets unearthed at Bath in England as well as archeological findings from other parts of the Roman empire. The student of Britannia will find the connections with Persia, Greece, Rome, and Egypt fascinating.<br />In the second essay, \\"Witches and Sorcerers in Classical Literature\\" Georg Luck of Johns Hopkins University discusses the concept of magic and it's many definitions as well as the practicioners of magic in all their incarnations. After reading his essay, I have a much better idea of what literary critics mean when they describe a modern work as a 'classic'. For example, resurrecting the dead was the aim of the necromancer (a type of sorcerer). What else could Dr. Frankenstein have been up to? And what the heck was Dante doing in hell?<br />These essays complement each other and the last essay ties them all together. I was raised Roman Catholic and am familiar with the teachings of the Church as well as the early writings of the Church elders, so I found the connections between magic and religion Valerie Flint of the University of Hull made in her essay intriguing.<br />Flint's essay, is entitled, \\"The Demonization of Magic and Sorcery in Late Antiquity: Christian Redefinitions of Pagan Religions.\\" Flint suggests the Roman Catholic Church condemmed the practicioners (Sorcerers and Magicians), offered them salvation, and then adopted many of their practicies. Goddesses and Demigods became saints, healing for a fee took on a new meaning, statues were transformed, prayers for crops took a new twist, sacrements and sacrifices were retained, and daemons took two forms--devils and angels.r and the last essay ties them all together.

I usually prefer women writers and/or mysteries set in England or American crime stories with hard-boiled female heros like Kay Scarpetta or Stephanie Plum. I was drawn to Thayer's book because the setting is Wisconsin--a state I have known and loved all my life. I think Thayer handled his descriptions of various places in Wisconsin pretty well.<br />Thayer's story is a compelling tale I read in a half day. This is the kind of book you take on a long plane flight or to the beach. Thayer is an excellent writer whose style is reminiscient of Hemingway's (not a particular favorite of mine but he wrote well). More than one aspect of THE WHEAT FIELD reminded me of THE SUN ALSO RISES.<br />Thayer's characterization of Pliny Pennington is believable. Pliny seems to be a cross between Forrest Gump and Micky Spillane and although there was a time when I would not have belived such a fellow could exist I now know there are innocents who are worldly-wise. Besides, Pliny the protagonist is relating the events in this story years later. Some of the dumb things he did as a younger man he would not have done in later life after he &quot;wized&quot; up.<br />Pliny is the Deputy Sherif of Kickapoo County, and although this book has been characterized as a &quot;police procedural&quot; it is not. There are NO forensics. Even though Pliny is a law enforcement officer, I would characterize him as more akin to the 1950s detective--you know the guy who was always in some kind of trouble because he trusted untrustworthy adversaries and was not above breaking the law himself. The other characters in this novel are shallowly drawn and generally as unlikable as the characters in a Mickey Spillane novel.<br />Thayer includes a good deal of pornography. He may have thought it was necessary for the plot, but his graphic descriptions seem a bit gratuitous at times. He introduces a character who knows a bit about voyeurism (a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin), a sort of &quot;profiler&quot; Pliny says. His unraveling of the plot stretches credibility at times. I figured out who the murderer was in the early part of the book. I think I mostly stuck with the book because it is a good read and I had to see what became of Pliny.

Washington and Jefferson used organic methods to grow their crops, vegetables, fruits, and flowers. Composting was a major activity for farmers until the petro-chemical industry persuaded farmers they needed oil-converted-to-fertilizer-and-poisons to grow crops. Practices are changing, but as the new AG bill shows, not fast enough.<br />Why should the little guy compost? This book gives you all sorts of reasons for composting, but my response is why not compost. You can compost if you live in an apartment on the 29th floor of a building in New York City, and you might want compost for your house plants after you read this book. I have composted for so long I cannot imagine how anyone gardens and does not compost. First of all you add nuitients not available from man-made sources and these nuitrients help you grow great plants. Think of compost as breast milk. Why would you give your roses canned formula when they can have the real thing? When you use compost on your plants, you strengthen them against disease and predators. Given drought conditions and water shortages which stress plants, it's nice to know that compost enhances moisture retention.<br />The book identifies the kinds of wastes that work best in the compost pile. For early farmers, manure was the answer. Most of us can still lay our hands on cow manure that has been composted, but it's expensive. There aren't as many farm animals as there once were and there are so many more of us. However, you do have some options even if you don't own your own cow. You produce things that can be converted into plant food.<br />The book suggests that you may not want use dog &quot;feces&quot; because it smells bad, but I do. My POMS poop and I pick it up and throw it in my black plastic compost container. (I have two kinds of composters and several loose piles--all described in the book). Guess what--dogs can eat a relatively vegetarian diet and they won't have stinky feces and they will be healthier (just like humans!!).<br />The book recommends against cat litter and feces, and I have used cat box litter after it was used by the cat and created HUGE plants (lots of nitrogen) so we stopped using cat stuff. I have used coco shells and they are great but cannot use them with dogs who are poisoned by the shells (the book does not tell you this, but as a rule of thumb don't let your dog eat compost or mulch). I love coffee grounds and throw them right on my rose bushes. Tea bags work better after they disintegrate in the compost bin. I also throw paper towels and kleenex from the waste baskets into the compost bin. Any vegetable matter can be composted. I avoid animal products except for the dog feces.<br />A friend of mine complained that her compost pile smelled bad. I asked her if she threw newly mowed grass on the pile. Yes she did. The book suggests you either let the grass lay where it falls (I've done this and it works--it does NOT cause thatch); Let the grass dry before you throw it on the compost pile; or don't grow grass. The latter has been my approach for some time. I do not have a blade of grass in my yard (a few in the brick walks, but that's another matter). Ground covers work well--especially creeping thyme.<br />This is a great book and a great place to begin if you are a new gardener. A kid can follow these directions. The authors include a chapter on organic gardening &quot;experiments&quot; you could try yourself or with a child--great ideas for science projects for school!! Also, if your family likes to fish, compost piles grow great worms, another benefit of composting.a great book and a great place to begin if you are a new gardener. A kid can follow these directions.

THE GROUP was published when I was very young, however, I was aware the book had created quite a stir because my Republican, Roman Catholic father and Democratic Protestant mother had many heated arguments over its content--which includes discussions about childrearing, hetero and homosexuality, mental illness and psycholanalysis, body functions, and Communist-party affiliation.<br />I have finally read Mary McCarthy's book and found it absolutely wonderful. Having completed it, I feel I understand my mother and aunts a little better. They were of the same genertion as Polly, Libby, Lakey, Kay, and the other eight Vasser graduates who are the protagonists of the book. Although my relatives attended state colleges in Wisconsin, I was exposed to &quot;thinking&quot; women who for the most part lived lives comparable to the women depicted in THE GROUP. All but one of my aunts married, and she became an &quot;old maid school teacher.&quot; Some of my uncles were more liberal than others, but all of the men including my father had expectations about how their wives should conduct themselves after marriage and motherhood. I came of age at the tail end of this oppressive period when women were still called girls.<br />As we read about the oppression of women in other parts of the world today, I cannot help but wonder if younger men and women can fully appreciate how recently civil rights have been extended to U.S. and European women. It's so easy to discount feminists but without the resumption of the Woman's Movement in the late 1950s and 1960s, a husband like Harald might still be able to have his wife Kay committed to a psychiatric hospital if she defended herself from his drunken attack.<br />THE GROUP covers the years 1933 to 1940--it begins just after the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression and ends with England on the verge of invasion from the Nazis. The book was described as a &quot;gem of American social history&quot; by 'The Nation' but it is also a very good read. (Supposedly, McCarthy based her characters on friends from her Vassar days, so one never knows how much is really fiction.)<br />Reading this book, I found myself outraged and sad and laughing out loud. The discussions about child rearing are enough to make you hoot -- especially if you have been exposed to the &quot;bottle versus breast&quot; battle. As the victim of parents like Priss and Sloan who read entirely too much literature, I went onto subject my children to the techniques of Dr. Spock, and am now am amused by the current thinking of my daughter and daughter-in-law who also read child-rearing literature and attend discussions and are struggling with potty-training and aggressive behaviour. If you have ever raised children or are trying to raise children you will enjoy the exchanges between parents and spouses and friends in this book.<br />The passages describing mental illness caused me react with everything from laughter to impotent rage. Polly's father is resentful because his melancholia has been rediagnosed as manic-depression -- only he's never had the manic experience. Polly's obsession with her psychoanalysis is familiar. Kay's incarceration in the &quot;looney bin&quot; and description of the several floors of the mental hospital dedicated to recovery--from the seventh floor lock-up with padded cells to the fourth floor &quot;just like a college dorm&quot; from whence the cured patient depart--is frightful. This is a great book. Don't let its publication date fool you, it's as salient today as it was the day it was written.t it is also a very good read.

If you know something about the Tarot cards, you may find TAROT AND THE JOURNEY OF THE HERO by Hajo Banzhaf contains familiar material as he agrees with much of what has been written elsewhere by Joseph Campbell and other experts. However, Banzhaf is extremely articulate, his writing clearly stated and beautifully illustrated, and his exploration of the links between the arcane language of the ancients and modern Jungian psychology rich and comprehensive.<br />If you are not familiar with the Tarot cards, Banzhaf's book is a good place to begin, especially if you have an interest Western literature, music, and/or the visual arts -- including Medieval and Renaissance paintings, German philosophy, and films by the Fargo Brothers such as &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;<br />Banzhaf is a very educated man who has studied religious and/or mythological tales and/or classical stories and appears to have an in-depth knowledge of the religious and/or philosophical nature of humans. He not only interprets key myths and tales, he explains the content of artworks from ancient India, Egypt, Greece, Rome, Italy, and Medieval Europe used to illustrate his text.<br />Banzhaf uses the Waite and Marseilles decks to illustrate each of the Major Arcana. Although he appreciates much of the content of the Waite deck, he challenges some of the changes Waite made relative to older decks.  Banzhaf eschews discussion of the Minor Arcana suggesting these cards are more recent and may be nothing more than playing cards or cards for fortune telling.  On the other hand, he views the 22 cards of Major Arcana (the Fool and his 21 stations) as the organizing principle for the classic tale of the hero -- whether Moses or Parzifal, Galahad or Ra, Gilgamesh or Jesus -- and the core story of every human life.<br />Banzhaf lays out the cards of the Major Aracana sequentially and divides the layout into two major paths -- the path of the daytime sun (active) and the path of the nighttime moon (passive).  He suggests that each soul must follow this path to reach paradise, heaven or the spritual world however it is defined. The daytime path has to do with becoming EGO, the worldly individual. The nighttime path is more difficlut and many become snared like the hanged man, slowly twisting in the wind. The nightime path involves the spiritual life where the gate is narrow and the way is hard.<br />This is a beautiful book, and although I bought the paperback, I plan to purchase the hardcover since I will be referring to the book again..and again.  As Banzhaf says, &quot;If we look to the path as a spiral, that gradually leads us to what is Highest, then each turn on this spriral corresponds to one hero's journey. Seen in this manner, as long as we are traveling, we will return to all twenty-one stations over and over, yet--at least we hope--this will always be on a somewhat higher level. At the uppermost point of the path, but really only there, does this last card mean the unity of all things.&quot;passive).

ENEMY WOMEN has been compared with COLD MOUNTAIN, and there are similarities, including a Civil War setting and Odessey-like experiences. The female protagonist is more heavily featured in  ENEMY WOMEN. Whereas COLD MOUNTAIN is set in the Great Smokies of North Carolina, ENEMY WOMEN is set in Southeastern Missouri in the Ozarks. Charles Frazier, the author of COLD MOUNTAIN wrote about his great-grandparents. I don't know if Paulette Jiles has written about her family, but she hails from the Missouri Ozarks.<br />Jiles describes the mountaineer Southerners as Scotch-Irish (not to be confused with Catholic Irish who fought for the North), who following their ill treatment at the hands of the Union became completely hostile to outsiders which was certainly the impression I gathered growing up in Western North Carolina as the child of a FED, Yankee, from the frozen North, who was Catholic, and descended from the &quot;other&quot; side.<br />Jiles is correct when she says that most Southerners did not own slaves (check the U.S. Census of 1850 and you will be stunned to see exactly who owned whom!!). And she performs a great service by once again pointing out that the Civil War was a mindless disaster. The aftermath of the half million needless deaths 1861-1865 was a depression in the South that lasted until after WWII, and fueled an everlasting hatred that time has yet to erase, which manifested itself in the 20th Century in Jim Crow laws, and other anti-social acts.<br />I'd like to say ENEMY WOMEN is as well written as COLD MOUNTAIN but I don't think it is. It's a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, however, so it's probably going to be a best seller. I found it an entertaining read--I read it in two sittings. However, I was disappointed by the underdeveloped main characters. William Neumann is a cipher and Adair Colley is all action and no reflection.<br />The book jacket description of Jiles as an &quot;old soul&quot; seems to be a bit of hype, although in her picture she appears to be a &quot;good ole girl.&quot; Jiles has a gift for metaphor and she paints some beautiful pictures with her words, but her scenes are ephemeral rather than substantive and I didn't get the same goose bumps I got with COLD MOUNTAIN. She has assembled enough material for a good movie, but Ang Lee already made a film about the underbelly of the Civil War in Kansas and Missouri called RIDE WITH THE DEVIL.<br />I thought perhaps Jiles used the Tarot and the 'journey of the hero' as an organizing principle for her work but I cannot find enough material to support this notion. Adair certainly believes in all sorts of &quot;old&quot; ways, and witches and fortune-tellers can be found inside and outside prison as can references to the Tarot deck. At one point, a &quot;hanged man&quot; graces a tree, and the moon and the stars are found in quite few scenes. There's a one-eyed man, but he belongs to another story, and he's not a Cyclops. There's a traveling troupe of actors with a dancing pig, but this is not Shakespeare either. There are plenty of bloody beastly scenes that will put you off your cornflakes. Those looking for romance may find more gore than kisses, but as General Sherman said, war is hell. Still, it's an interesting book and if you like period pieces that move at a fast pace you'll probably enjoy it.e she appears to be a &quot;good ole girl.&quot; Jiles has a gift for metaphor and she paints some beautiful pictures with her words, but her scenes are ephemeral rather than substantive and I didn't get the same goose bumps I got with COLD MOUNTAIN.

My favorite of the 11 short stories in ACROSS THE BRIDGE is the euponymous tale set in Paris sometime around the mid-20th Century. One is never sure of the exact date of one of Mavis Gallant's stories as they are so timeless. In &quot;Across the Bridge&quot; the heroine is engaged to be married, and at the last moment persuades her parents to call off the ceremony. The picture Gallant paints of white wedding invitations floating away in the Seine is quite startling and could have taken place at any time over the past 150 years.<br />Gallant's writing has been compared with that of Alice Munro with some justification. Both authors write short stories, sometimes linked to each other (as are several of the tales in ACROSS THE BRIDGE), frequently told from a woman's point of view, about family matters -- engagements, enduring and/or barely endured marriages, children wanted and unwanted, money worries, daughters whisked off to nunneries or other out-of-the-way place, unrequieted love, revenge -- and faith or lack of it.<br />Both women are Canadian authors, though Munro tends to write about the non-Gallic mostly Scots-descent Canadians whereas Gallant's stories are most often about French Canadienne or Parisienne protagonists. Munro and Gallant are both frequently published in the New Yorker Magazine, and most of the stories in ACROSS THE BRIDGE appeared in the New Yorker before being added to this collection.<br />Each of the tales told by Gallant this book is about rejection and acceptance. For example, in &quot;A State of Affairs&quot; the refugee status of a very elderly Polish Jew living in Paris following a WWII Nazi prison camp internment becomes imperiled when 'normal' relations are restored between Poland and France. In &quot;The Fenton Child&quot; a baby is both wanted and unwanted.<br />Gallant's writing is literate and compelling, and I find myself reflective after reading one of her stories. She does not feel a need to tie up loose ends or make the world seem better or worse than it really is. She has a gift for arousing empathy. Often, it seems to me, her stories include a relatively positive note. In &quot;Across the Bridge&quot; for example, at one point the young narrator says &quot;It was a small secret, insignificant, but it belonged to the true life that was almost ready to let me in. And so it did, and yes, it made me happy.&quot;seem better or worse than it really is. She has a gift for arousing empathy. Often, it seems to me, her stories include a relatively positive note.

Stan Hinden writes a column for the Washington Post and I've read his column since day one. I cannot say this is the best book ever written on the subject because I've only read three books, but I can say I've learned a great deal about retirement from Mr. Hinden and what I've learned was not taught in the midcareer retirement seminar I attended.<br />Unlike some who write on the subject, Mr. Hinden is actually retired...well sort of.  He took a retirement pension from the Washington Post and then started writing his column on retirement, and now he has published a book on the subject. As Yogi Berra said, it ain't over until it's over.<br />Mr. Hinden says although you may retire from one job, perhaps you'll go onto another. Many folks retire from several jobs over the course of their life. Others figure out how to retire once and do it before 40. Mr. Hinden's main point is to rethink what retirement means to you. And, it's very important to have a plan for your &quot;retired&quot; years.<br />Mr. Hinden deals with financial matters, probably not with the comprehensiveness of a financial planner, but he provides enough information to get you started asking the right questions as well as a list of other sources with more in-depth information.  A few of his goodies include -- yes, you can arrange with Social Security to make deductions for tax purposes, and yes, you may be eligible for pension coverage from a former employee if you were vested before you left.<br />Mr. Hinden underwent surgery a few years ago, and he has a great deal to say about medical expenses and health insurance. He also has some things to say about decisions he made prior to retirement concerning his beneficiaries. He also explains some of the mysteries associated with Part A and Part B Medicare. He also discusses the value of long-term health care insurance.<br />It's never too early to think about retirement planning. I am sending copies of Mr. Hinden's book to all my children so they can begin to think about it. That should boost his post-retirement income by a few cents.begin to think about it.

Dr. Stephen Mitchell was a respected psychoanalyst in New York City prior to his untimely death following the publication of CAN LOVE LAST? THE FATE OF ROMANCE OVER TIME. In this book, Mitchell explores the nature of romantic love -- the love two individuals unrelated by blood can have for each other but lose over time. These couples can be hetero, homo, married or not.<br />Mitchell suggests most relationships don't last because of romantic love. If romantic love exists at all in a long-term relationship, most of the time it does so in spite of other key factors that hold the couple together. In other words, there are many 'ties that bind' and most if not all kill romantic interest.<br />The most common motivation for coupling is the perceived need for security most people associate with connectedness to another person. Romance is not associated with security, however, it is associated with risk and unknowing. In the end, the need to acquire security via knowing all the details about the beloved, i.e. objectivity or elimination of the 'unknown', overwhelms romantic love. Generally, individuals who grew up in chaotic situations have an excessive need eliminate the unknown and are therefore very likely to kill romantic love.<br />Dr. Mitchell provides a number of case histories in his book to illustrate his key points -- ideas others have explored that he presents in a fresh and unique way. In the end, he seems to side with the existentialist Sarte who suggested that security is an illusion since death intervenes in every life. Dr. Mitchell asks, will you regret the things you did or did not do in your effort to secure your life? To truly live, one must work past the last illusion.	2002-02-25

I was slightly annoyed when I realized this as I am a gardener and naively thought this book would get back to some &quot;original&quot; foods, but it does not. However, that being said, the book does contain some rather good recipes, and unlike other books on the various cuisines of the area, this book contains a nice selection of dishes that include eggplant. I am an eggplant nut, so for that reason alone I'll keep the book. Not only does the book include 10 recipes with eggplant as the star, all the recipes are tasty--although some are a bit spicy and not all are low-cal (maybe none of them are).<br />There are plenty of other good vegetable dishes. I also fancy okra, and Wright has included a delicious recipe &quot;Okra with Olive Oil&quot; that uses pomegranate molassas. Another dish Wright describes as a &quot;guiless dish from Apulia&quot; is &quot;Oven-baked Potatoes and Mushrooms&quot; with portobello mushrooms and pecorino cheese.<br />Wright says he is not a vegetarian, so don't buy this book if you're opposed to animal products in your vegetables.

Within the academic world where he spent the better part of his career, the late Joseph Campbell had a somewhat unique approach to the study, interpretation, and understanding of mythology.  Whereas his fellow scholars most often approached the subject with an analytic eye, Campbell suggested an alternative way --using the artistic eye. In &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; Campbell suggested myths &quot;were not manufactured&quot; that they were &quot;spontaneous productions of the psyche&quot; and that each reflected the &quot;germ power of the source.&quot;<br />In A JOSEPH CAMPBELL COMPANION, Diane Osborn has assembled excerpts from Campbell's many works, and distilled the central ideas Campbell wrote about over the years concerning the origin and purpose of myths. She has organized these excerpts into topical areas: &quot;In the Field&quot;, &quot;Living in the World&quot;, &quot;Coming into Awareness&quot;, and &quot;Living in the Sacred.&quot; Although the topics can be viewed as linear, reflecting the progress of the soul or psyche, I suspect Campbell would have suggested they are also cyclical and that one exists in all four simultaneously.<br />I feel the last section of the Campbell Companion, &quot;Living in the Sacred&quot;, contains some particularly insightful notions regarding the nature of art and artistic endeavor, and the role of art in affecting human lives. In this section, Osborn has quoted heavily from Campbell's &quot;Myths to Live By&quot; and provided quotations from several of the artists who affected Campbell's own life and writing including James Joyce and Walt Whitman.<br />For example, Campbell describes how the words of the German writer Schiller, in answer to a friend's problem with 'writer's block' -- &quot;Your problem is that you bring in the critical factor before the lyical factor has had a chance to express itself&quot; -- affected his own thinking and writing.  Campbell says he had allowed the criticism of other &quot;scholars&quot; to interfere with his artistic processes, and that Schiller's words freed him to get on with &quot;seeing&quot; and &quot;hearing&quot; what myths could teach him.<br />&quot;Mythologies and religions are great poems and, when recoginzed as such, point infallibly through things and events to the ubiquity of a 'presence' or 'eternity'that is whole and entire in each....The first condition, therefore, that any mythology must fulfill if it is to render life to modern lives is that of cleansing the doors of perception to the wonder, at once terrible and fascinating, of ourselves and of the universe of which we are the ears and eyes and the mind.&quot;;scholars&quot; to interfere with his artistic processes, and that Schiller's words freed him to get on with &quot;seeing&quot; and &quot;hearing&quot; what myths could teach him. <br />&quot;Mythologies and religions are great poems and, when recoginzed as such, point infallibly through things and events to the ubiquity of a 'presence' or 'eternity'that is whole and entire in each....The first condition, therefore, that any mythology must fulfill if it is to render life to modern lives is that of cleansing the doors of perception to the wonder, at once terrible and fascinating, of ourselves and of the universe of which we are the ears and eyes and the mind.&quot;	2002-02-23

Woad, Indigo, Azurite, Lapis, Copper Silicate, Blue Vitriol are some of the sources of the color blue.  BLUE, THE HISTORY OF A COLOR, by Michel Pastoureau, is a beautiful art history book, whose organizing principle is the color--blue. Pastoureau's book is a bit &quot;Francocentered&quot; but nevertheless, who better to reflect on blue than a Frenchman. BLUE is both informative and entertaining and a must for any serious art book collector. The photgraphy of various works of art--including selected stained glass windows from the early church--is stunning. The book is loaded with illustrations showing pages from psalters, cathedral windows, figurines, and other art.<br />For millions of years, the major colors for artistic expression were Black-White-Red. Ancient tales such as &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, &quot;Snow White&quot;, and &quot;The Fox and the Crow&quot; reflect this primary triad. The Romans considered blue an inferior color, especially since the Celts up North had discovered the leaves from the Woad plant could be made into a beautiful blue &quot;pastel&quot; suitable for body painting. The liturgal colors of the Catholic Church date from Roman times and are red-white-black (green was added later). However, at some point between the time the Romans lost Europe and the Catholic Church reentered recorded history, blue became associated with Mary the mother of Christ. When Abbe Suger built St. Denis, blue began to rival red for supremacy within the church, although blue never became a vestment color. When St. Louis built his Chapel and the Capet family became the rulers of France with Mary as their patron, the fleur de lis on a blue background became the family standard and the flag of France (fleur de lis = lily of Mary, although it may be a blue flag or iris).<br />No sooner had blue become THE color of colors, than the Protestants (Pastoureau calls them &quot;Chromoclasts&quot;) demanded everything be turned black to reflect sin and penance. After they smashed a few thousand church windows, these reformers, who have been linked to capitalism, turned everything else black -- from telephones to automobiles. As Henry Ford once said, the customer can have any color he wants as long as it's black. Black went on to became the dress of high society--from stove pipe hats to tuxedoes to the little black dress.<br />During the Reformation, red and white had been dismissed by the Protestants but the shot heard round the world gave them a second chance as the new red-white-blue and blue-white-red flags led to military pants and coats in similar colors. But red and white were a dismal failure as they made targets of their wearers. Blue blends into the horizon so it has lasted longer as a battle garment. Although jungle fatigues and black commando suits are more often than not seen on modern battlefields, mess dress is still blue-white-red for many, and UN soldiers wear fleur-de-lis blue helmets. Blue eventually replaced black on the social front as descendents of the &quot;Puritans&quot; gave up black frocks for navy blue blazers and jeans.<br />Pastoureau covers iconography, iconology, symbolism, sociology, ethnology, the economic aspects of weaving, dyeing, and manufacture, and a host of other topics associated with the color blue. The book is incredibly rich in detail but far too short, and in the end it raises more questions than it addresses. Pastoureau points to many historical sources that have yet to be translated or fully examined, and art history majors looking for a thesis subject would be well advised to check out this book.After they smashed a few thousand church windows, these reformers, who have been linked to capitalism, turned everything else black -- from telephones to automobiles.

Okay, maybe I'm biased or old-fashioned or both, but I don't find the apartments shown in BIG IDEAS FOR SMALL SPACES-STUDIO APARTMENTS attractive. The authors are both men with a great deal of knowledge about design, and I am sure their ideas will appeal mostly to men.<br />The examples shown are minimalist, modern, angular, and seem to belong to hard-working types who drop in only to sleep. For the most part these apartments are lacking in color which is the single most important element in decorating as far as I am concerned.  Although the authors show some colorful ideas in their section on &quot;cozy&quot; apartments, for the most part their idea of making a place more homey seems to be adding books on shelves, chunky ashtrays, and sports trophies. In addition to cold, angular furniture and clunky &quot;knickknacks&quot;, the minimalist rooms are often without curtains and/or have walls that are downright stark. One idea of &quot;lightening&quot; shows a curtain with a &quot;porthole&quot; in it that allows one to &quot;look out&quot; at the view.<br />If you're a guy looking for a book on how to decorate an appartment with a modernist &quot;masculine&quot; look this may be the book for you. One other note: the book was printed in China and the photographs looks like those in 1950s era books even though the publication date is 2000.	2002-02-16

Lately, I've been reading books on the topic of MAKING THE MOST OF SMALL SPACES, and Anoop Parikh's book is the best book on this topic I've seen so far. Different books will appeal to different people, but if you're female, with a studio apartment or small condo as your primary residence--or--own a vacation condo or keep an apartment in the city as a second residence, I think this book will give you many good ideas. Those who own condos and can make architectural changes will probably benefit the most.<br />The exquisite examples Parikh provides take advantage of color, light and texture, the three most important elements to consider when creating your home in a small space. Color can be used to brighten dark spaces and produce the illusion of depth or openness or warmth. Properly placed lighting ensures that arrangements that involve stacking (plenty of examples in this book) and/or low ceilings do produce black holes. Texture can be used to move the eye around what could be a dull room if it is painted a light or white color.<br />Parikh says before you begin to decorate, you should consider what you will be doing in your home. Do you eat out more than you eat in? If so, it makes no sense to have regular sized appliances that take up needed space. Maybe what you need is a closet kitchen with a small refrigerator, sink, microwave and hot plate. Parikh suggests one think about 1) whether or not you want your room open or cozy; 2) what you might use as a focal point (a piece of furniture, a screen?); 3) using the walls for storage and/or display; 4) hiding the bed; 5) keeping the cooking and eating areas close together to avoid accidents. This is a great book with an excellent price.	2002-02-16

If you don't feel like reading Simom Schama's 600+ page EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES, or Israel's 1100+ page THE DUTCH REPUBLIC, Simon Zumthor's DAILY LIFE IN REMBRANDT'S HOLLAND may be the book for you. Zumthor's book was written in French, and first published in English the early 1960s.  My paperback copy was published in 1994 by Standford University as part of the &quot;Daily Life&quot; series.<br />If you're not particularly interested in the politics of the 17th Century, or the military action that took place during the various wars (which Schama and Israel cover in more detail), and you want to delve right into the everyday lives of the people, Zumthor's book allows you to do so. Zumthor covers everything from clothing to food to employment to housing to you name it--all those things all of us do that make up our daily lives.<br />The section on the artistic elements of Dutch society is relatively short, and Rembrandt is really only mentioned in passing, but you do get an impression of what he, and Vermeer, and other painters probably experienced as they went about their business.  Rembrandt and the other painters were not seen as &quot;artists&quot; but rather as &quot;painters&quot; and as such were members of guilds--Medieval organizations that were organized by various occupational groups and still thrived in the first part of the 17th Century in the Netherlands. Zumthor spends some time discussing how the guilds worked and how they were regulated by not only their members but the towns and villages.<br />Zumthor also provides much interesting information about Dutch church life, community life, and home life and the obsession of the people with cleaning -- stoops, linens, clothes, but according to Zumthor, not always bodies.  The Dutch in the 17th Century were a complicted folk, and although I have read Schama and Israel, I enjoyed this book. It's great background reading, especially if you wonder how your own ancestors lived. Read it with Poortvliet's illustrated books, however, as it lacks illustrations (my paperback copy did).ated books, however, as it lacks illustrations (my paperback copy did).	2002-02-15

Two of my children recently moved into new homes -- one in San Diego (1450 square feet), and the other in Washington DC (1500 square feet &amp; four children). They both have high rents/mortgage payments and modest budgets, so I've been helping them search for clever ways to live in small spaces -- i.e. maximize efficiency, minimize costs, and preserve attractiveness. COMPACT LIVING contains many attractive ideas for economizing on space (for those whose tastes run to modern), but executing these ideas may prove more expensive than the author Jane Graining suggests (at least in the high rent areas!).<br />Graining has attempted to address the needs of both the renter and the home owner, but most of her ideas are better suited to the home owner (whether condo or small house) who can afford to make relatively permanent changes. Some ideas involve clever collapsing furniture which is portable, but the furniture shown is relatively expensive (wall beds, telescoping tables).<br />She provides numerous examples of walls and ceilings opened with skylights and bigger windows and she advocates the use of glass blocks and mirrors for lighting interior areas with remote sources of light. She also suggests bright colors in the form of painted or tiled surfaces can be used to &quot;lighten&quot; a room and make it appear bigger. For example, one idea involves two wall beds housed behind bright enamel red &quot;closet&quot; doors that are separated by a vertical, foot-wide floor to ceiling glass block strip which allows daylight to penetrate into the bathroom beyond. This detailed work is not a minor modification however parsimonious and attractive the use of space.<br />Graining says those who live in small spaces must think vertically, and she offers a number of nifty ideas for employing overhead space to accomodate loft beds, book shelving, cupboards, pantries, closets, stackable appliances, and racks of pots and pans. Many of her illustrations include vertical elements designed by architects and installed by professionals or extremely talented amateurs. Clever and talented folks may be able to copy some of her ideas without breaking the bank, but I am not that clever.gned by architects and installed by professionals or extremely talented amateurs.

Prior to her death, Kinta Beevor wrote only one book -- A TUSCAN CHILDHOOD -- which would have been better titled &quot;My Life in Tuscany&quot; as it really is the tale of her connection to Tuscany over period of 40 years that included her childhood. Beevor, whose maiden name was Waterfield, was the daughter Aubrey the artist and his wife Lina Gordon, both British ex-pats who lived and worked in Italy during the first half of the 20th Century. The family owned the fabulous 15th Century Fortezza della Brunella which the family called &quot;the castle&quot; and Lina inherited Poggio Gherardo which was almost as old. Both properties came with extensive farm lands. As a result the Waterfields lived lives of comfort -- socializing with the rich and famous (D.H.Lawrence for one) and feeding them to-die-for meals and sending their much neglected children back to England for schooling.<br />Though I became weary of name-dropping, I found Beevor's book an enjoyable read. Her mention of various rich and famous folks is as natural as can be--just tiresome in the same way a story told over and over by an older person can be. She says her son encouraged her to write down what she could remember, and I suspect he did so after he heard her stories several times. Fortunately, someone had the good sense to publish the book for a wider audience.<br />Ms. Beevor obviously loved Tuscany--her father's castle where the family restored and maintained a beautiful garden on the roof, her mother's house which Beevor's mother gained the use of on the death of her Aunt Janet, and the beautiful Tuscan countryside. Beevor's description of the sea as the train approached Aulla for her summer vacations from school in England is as well written as anything Lawrence ever wrote, and no doubt she was quite knowledgeable of his works given he was a family friend.<br />After WWII, faced with death duties on the Poggio Gherardo following the death of Beevor's brother John, and huge expenses owing to the damage inflicted on both properties during the war (the retreating Nazis and the encroaching Allies made a mess, the latter found an autographed photo of Mussolini in the castle and wrecked havoc) the family was forced to sell up and return to England.<br />Beevor's book contains passages that reminded me of bitter-sweet scenes in &quot;The English Patient&quot;, the &quot;Jewel in the Crown&quot;, &quot;Tea With Mussolini&quot;, &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, &quot;Room With a View&quot; and other works written by European ex-pats returned to their home of origin. Ms Beevor was undoubtedly well read and understood the withdrawal of the British Empire following WWII, and in her closing chapters she shares her thoughts about the effect of that withdrawal on Italy. Italy of course was not a colony, but the British had truly made themselves at home in Italy before the war (and may have done so once again).e damage inflicted on both properties during the war (the retreating Nazis and the encroaching Allies made a mess, the latter found an autographed photo of Mussolini in the castle and wrecked havoc) the family was forced to sell up and return to England.<br />Beevor's book contains passages that reminded me of bitter-sweet scenes in &quot;The English Patient&quot;, the &quot;Jewel in the Crown&quot;, &quot;Tea With Mussolini&quot;, &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, &quot;Room With a View&quot; and other works written by European ex-pats returned to their home of origin.

I read SAFFRON during my lunch break and as it is a small light-weight book I was able to complete it in 2 weeks or 10 lunch breaks. SAFFRON is exactly the kind of book I like to take to work for lunch-time reading: small enough to carry in my backpack; interesting enough to induce me to put my work aside and take a much needed noon-time break; compartmentalized enough that I can read it in installments without losing track; and about food which generally increases my enjoyment of my midday meal which consists of raw carrots, boiled eggs, yogurt and an orange.<br />SAFFRON is not as well researched or comprehensive as TULIP by Anna Pavord nor is it as informative or well written as the &quot;cooking&quot; books of Elizabeth David whom Willard clearly admires. (In fact, Willard suggests the reader use David's books for recipes.) Willard explains in the opening section that she has not written an historical book documented with citations, nor has she provided recipes that work in all cases. (She says she has not tried many of them--in some cases the ingredients are no longer available or unknown, or the weights and measurements are unknown.)<br />Willard has gathered together interesting tidbits from a variety of sources -- autobiographical events which are probably the most entertaining part of the book as she is very forthcoming; tales, stories, quotes from literature and history, some sources mentioned in passing, other not, some researched others not. Willard's take on history is flawed but amusing. My sense is that that she selected material based on it's entertainment value not it's verismilitude. Willard's book provides the reader with a bit of diversion, and I for one need frivolity sometimes.	2002-02-02

Christopher Snyder says the inhabitants of what is known today as England, Scotland, and Wales would not have called themselves Britons before the arrival of the Romans. In pre-Roman days they would have been known by names associated with their tribal affiliations. Many of the individuals might have referred to themselves as 'Combrogi' or 'Cymry' the latter a Welsh term referring to friendship and/or love of place. The Romans named the &quot;big&quot; island across the &quot;English&quot; channel Brittania. About 400 years after they arrived, the Romans formally withdrew from Britain and left behind a changed place (and probably a few ex-Romans) -- including the name by which the inhabitants knew themselves.<br />For a long while scholars referred to the period following the departure of &quot;official&quot; Rome and the final &quot;conquest&quot; of Britain by Angles, Saxons, and Jutes the 'dark ages'. More recently, scholars have referred to this era, which stretches from about 400-600 A.D. 'sub-Roman Britain'. Christopher Snyder says he would prefer to call it the Brittonic Age, although his book title names it AN AGE OF TYRANTS.<br />Snyder's book is divided into three parts. First, he explores the written record -- the writings of Britains Patrick (5th Century) and Gildas (6th Century) and other non-Britonic witnesses. He discusses Latin terms from the extant written material, such as the word &quot;tyrant&quot; which was construed differently by different people in different places speaking different languages. Snyder suggests the &quot;tyrants&quot; described by St. Jerome or the Honorable Bede may not have been as badly behaved as the negative connotation of theit term suggests. In fact, Snyder says the tyrants distant churchmen described may have been more akin to the &quot;tigern&quot; or Celtic lord.<br />In the second part of his book, Synder discusses the archeological record of the Brittonic Age--which has been overlooked and undervalued as it falls between the rich material record of the Roman (Cirencester, Bath) and Anglo-Saxon (Sutton Hoo) periods. I found this section of the book illuminating as Snyder has systmatically inventoried and synthesized the evidence from a many &quot;digs&quot; into a coherent whole.<br />In the third section of his book, Snyder uses the material from parts 1 and 2 to describe life in the Brittonic Age in various kinds of settlements (towns, villas, forts, etc.) and the social structure of the people including aspects of government, religion, military, and economic. He says the Britains were a Romanized-Christian people who did not revert back to the tribal behavior that existed before the coming of the Romans.<br />Snyder is a professor at Marymount University and for all I know he is a member of a religious order, but having graduated from Georgetown University myself, I know that religious affiliation does not mean one cannot be objective. However, Snyder's conclusion that pagan ways disappeared in the Brittonic Age as the population became Christianized may not be exactly accurate.<br />Based on a reading of the material in Snyder's book and other material, I suspect Celtic ways and the Christian ways merged into an entirely new religion. According to Snyder, Pope Gregory suggested at one point that as the clergy converted pagans they  should adapt &quot;pagan temples and rituals to Christian usage in nonviolent ways.&quot; I think that is exactly what happened, and I think that explains in part why The Blessed Virgin Mary became so important in Great Britain--which Snyder, a professor at MARYmount might have noted.between the rich material record of the Roman (Cirencester, Bath) and Anglo-Saxon (Sutton Hoo) periods.

I have read all Minette Walthers' mysteries and like some of her books better than others. From my perspective, THE SHAPE OF SNAKES is one of her better books, although not nearly as original or thrilling as THE ICE HOUSE or THE SCULPTRESS.<br />Although some of her readers did not like THE BREAKER, I though it was quite good and liked it better than THE SHAPE OF SNAKES. BREAKER was very original and I learned a great deal about the tides and coastline of Southern England from her research--a plus for an Anglophile like me. SNAKES like BREAKER left me sad, but in one someone dies owing to a huge misunderstanding, while in the other someone dies owing to cruelty and prejudice. I don't know which is worse.<br />Readers of Walter's books will recognize many familar elements in the SHAPE OF SNAKES including her addiction to overly long exchanges of dialogue among and between too many characters. The end result is a somewhat confused denouement (she may have been thinking the screen adaptation but it does not play well in print). Walters uses the same device she used in THE ICE HOUSE and THE SCULPTRESS -- an historical approach which relies on a determined protagonist who is trying to understand and piece together events that occurred many years before which are tied to someone's death. The protagonist's meddling inevitably leads to the uncovering of many old skeltons in many old closets and the threat of personal bodily harm.<br />In SNAKES, the protagonist, known only by the letter &quot;M&quot; (for &quot;mad&quot;??) is married to an apparently long-suffering fellow named Sam who has given her various versions of what he was doing on the night a near neighbor was found dead in the street by &quot;M&quot;. I felt as if &quot;M&quot; might say to him at any moment -- &quot;Would you like to run that by me again Sam?&quot; And, Sam isn't the only one who can't get his story straight!!<br /><br />I believe Walters used to write soap operas. Perhaps that is why she does such a wonderful job of developing exchanges between people with close relationships, husbands and wives, mothers and daughters, girlfriends and boyfriends, and friend-friends. Her understanding of the psychology of her fellow human beings is so acute she seldom drops the ball (i.e. characters seldom act out of character) but when she does it is noticible. I am not sure she does &quot;tarts&quot; &quot;whores&quot; and other disreputable types as well as she does vicar's wives and endearing fathers. Probably, she has not had a great deal of experience with the former.<br />Walters has been compared to Ruth Rendell and P.D. James. I would say her writing is more akin to the former than the latter. Most of the time James' killers partially redeem themselves (usually they have been wounded by their victims, often they die for their sins). Although James does not create tidy endings or resolve every outstanding moral issue in her books, to my knowledge, she has infrequently created a truly despicable character.  Cold-blooded creatures populate Rendell's books, and in SNAKES, Walters succeeds in creating some ghastly individuals herself.ch a wonderful job of developing exchanges between people with close relationships, husbands and wives, mothers and daughters, girlfriends and boyfriends, and friend-friends.

Paul Gervais is not Mathew Spender, nor is he Peter Mayle, nor is he Frances Mayes. Spender is an artist with a flair for description who fills his book about the life of an Englishman in Italy with all sorts of charming anecdotes about his Italian neighbors. Mayle may have initiated the recent round of books on the life of the well-heeled foreigner who moves to a sunnier and &quot;older&quot; part of Europe and rebuilds an &quot;older&quot; more archaic home and/or garden and in the process discovers the eccentric neighbors. Mayes has done an execllent job of continuing the writing and rebuilding trend with her books about the restoration of an older home she bought and inhabits part of the year in the Tuscan hills in-between-bouts as a tv cook or whatever it is she does back in SF to pay the bills (her books may bring in some revenue).<br />As a former addict of &quot;This Old House&quot; on public tv, and one who has struggled with the restoration of an antebellum home in the states (i.e. an old farm house my father owned--I was his &quot;helper&quot;), I occasionally read books about the restoration of big old houses and gardens and enjoy them because I am NOT doing the work. Reading about the travails of others as the struggle to build new lives in strange places is a comfortable arm chair pursuit. Occasionally, these authors become so famous they have to move away, though some of them return.<br />Paul Gervais' book is a sort-of &quot;good read&quot; although the serious gardener won't learn anything about gardening from it. If you're looking for inspiration about house restoration you would do better to watch &quot;This Old House&quot; on public tv. If you've never read Mayle or Mayes you will probably enjoy these writers a bit more. I laughed so hard when I read Mayle's first book that I cried and that experience is not to be missed by those who need a reading &quot;lift&quot; although by now most of the world has already read about Mayle's life in Provence.<br />In his book on life in Lucca, Gervais spends a bit of time discussing the work he and his partner Gil pursued restoring the house, the dependencies, and the grounds if their home, the Villa Massei in Massa Macinaia, a small town in the province of Lucca, Italy. He assumes a familiarity with Italy, Lucca, Italian architecture, gardens, history, etc. If you have a background adequate enough to follow what he is discussing, you may find the book inadequate, if not, you may become bored or lost or both. He seems to have written the book for his friends and acquaintenances who are already familiar with his sitution. The tone of the text is newsy -- as if he has penned a letter to the folks back home informing them about how things are progressing. I would have enjoyed Gervais' book a bit more if he had included some photographs, particularly of those gardens he visits that fall into the categor of &quot;famous and private&quot; and are off the beaten track.e. <br />In his book on life in Lucca, Gervais spends a bit of time discussing the work he and his partner Gil pursued restoring the house, the dependencies, and the grounds if their home, the Villa Massei in Massa Macinaia, a small town in the province of Lucca, Italy.

Books on the origins of English words, generally agree the word 'garden' comes from the old German for an enclosed safe space where living things including vegetables, flowers and children can be safely grown. Modern dictionaries expand the meaning a bit, but for the most part gardens remain places of safety, nurturing, repose, and reflection. The huge fields containing monocrops grown by large commercial interests, where nothing survives except the cash crop of interest, are the antithesis of the garden, which is literally and figuratively the source of life.<br />According to the Christian Bible (and the Jewish Torah), the original garden (Eden) contained the tree of life. MONASTIC GARDENS, by Mick Hales, is about the importance of gardens for the well being of bodies, minds, emotions, and eternal souls. The places he visited and photographed in the U.S. and Europe reflect the lost paradise and the paradise to come. Many of the gardens contain a tree as a focal point in remembrance of the Garden of Eden.<br />In addition to setting an example of the life well lived, providing a place of refuge for the weary soul, and working for their own sustanance, the most important good deed the monks and nuns who tend the living spaces in monastic gardens do is to contribute to the preservation of the diversity of life humankind at times seems bent on obliterating in it's mad quest for &quot;perfection&quot;. Around the world other spiritual/religious groups are similarly engaged in this very important work. One can think of the Amish who live in the mid-Atlantic areas of the U.S. as like-minded souls who understand the modern obsession with &quot;perfectionism&quot; is a deadly illusion if not downright sinful.<br />Hale's photographs and text encourage meditation. Cloister walks and clipped box mazes reflect the paradox of life as a journey of the soul toward the infinite.

I collect art history books, and I would not consider FLORA by Edward Lucie-Smith an art book. The representations of various paintings (mostly by European artists, even when they depict subjects in Africa or Asia) are too small to view as the works of art they were intended to be. The book is so crammed with illustrations (and very little text) that it appears overwhelming to the eye when casually flipped through. If you turn the pages slowly, each representation appears relatively more attactive (Monet is not juxtaposed with Cranach--though Watteau is, and on two side-by-side 3&quot;x5&quot; pages!!).<br />There is no chronological order to this book, nor does the author use cultural themes (Romantic, Classic, etc.) as an organizing principle. Rather, Lucie-Smith has organized a plethora of paintings via a subjective classification system that makes sense some of the time. A short introductory text is found at the beginning of each of these sections which include topics such as: &quot;The Mirror of Paradise&quot;, &quot;Sowing and Reaping&quot;, etc. Notable quotes are interspersed throughout the book along with information about each of the various illustrations. For example, the section on &quot;The Language of Flowers&quot; contains a quote from Albert Camus. &quot;To lose touch with flowers is the supreme separation.&quot; I believe he wrote this regarding prison life, but how is one to know if one is not familiar with Camus? And, knowing this tidbit of information makes the words more meaningful.<br />If you appreciate and are somewhat familiar with European art you might find FLORA disappointing. If you love &quot;feel good&quot; books filled with pretty pictures (and plenty of weird ones too) and notable quotes (not Yogi Berra), you may enjoy the book. I am ambivalent. I neither like the book nor do I dislike it which is why I gave it 3 stars.

I believe each person who discovers the Tarot is a seeker of wisdom and knows there is a Power greater than ourselves. The Tarot reflects the combined wisdom of humans who have sought an understanding of the Will of the Divine or as Joseph Campbell has said it the Will of &quot;the thing that stands behind.&quot;<br />My own path originated in a diverse religious upbringing, winded through an academic setting filled with various social science perspectives, encompassed therapy, developmental workshops, spiritual retreats, etc., and came to rest in a 12-step program. After all these experiences, I recogize the Tarot as a cumulative human effort that places a face on the sum of my experiences. I too started as &quot;the fool&quot; and discoved the world.<br />A knowledge of Jungian psychology will help one understand and appreciate Karen Hamaker Zondag's TAROT AS A WAY OF LIFE. If you've taken a Myers-Briggs personality test, read Joseph Campbell's works on 'The Hero' or seen the Moyers-Campbell interviews, are familiar with T.S. Elliot's poem 'The Wasteland', or ever been in a 12-step program, you've been exposed to Jungian concepts.<br />Using Jungian concepts, Zondag explains how the Tarot deck can help the individual develop and use an organizing principle for living. Each of the cards of the Major Arcana represents some aspect of life that occurs for every conscious human being. Zondag divides the cards of the Major Arcana into three components: the basic drives; the construction of the ego; and the integration of the consciousness and unconsciousness. Zondag uses illustrations from several sets of Tarot cards to show why she prefers the Waite Tarot Deck illustrated by Pamela Coleman Smith over others.<br />Some who work with the Tarot use only the Major Arcana, but Zondag uses both the major and minor decks. The Minor deck has four &quot;suits&quot; comparable to a regular deck of playing cards: Cups (Water, Hearts, Wine, Clergy); Wands (Fire, Clubs, Rue, Peasants); Swords (Air, Spades, Angels, Ivy, Needles, Aristoi); Pentacles (Coins, Diamonds, Salt, Commerce).<br />Zondag associates the Yin/Yang principle with the cards. Thus Cups and Pentacles are receptive or feminine and Swords and Wands are creative or masculine. Interestingly, the Yang cards are frequently associated with strife and anger as well as building and accomplishment, whereas the Yin cards are associated with passivity, love, wealth, and happiness. There are Yang Queens and Yin Kings, so one cannot argue the cards are stereotypes in a negative sense although they may be &quot;types&quot; in a positive sense. Each person regardless of sex can exhibit any of the aspects reflected in the Tarot cards.<br />Zondag offers several ways to do a Tarot reading. Readings are designed to &quot;guide&quot; the recipient, not &quot;forecast&quot; the future. Conceivably, if one chooses to ignore the cards one can, and suffer the consequences. I've done several readings for a female who is a Leo with an IQ of 165, has red hair and a temper to match. We keep turning up the Queen of Wands who sits on a throne where lions serve as arm rests. Zondag says this card combines the receptivity of the Yin with the independence and activity of Wands. &quot;The Queen of Wands is no stanger to the desire for attention. Her penchant for getting involved, and her natural activity, often result in firey enthusiasm, which she is mature enough to keep within bounds...the Queen of Wands provides a powerful stimulus to action.&quot; I always tell my Leo that she holds the key to her destiny in her own hands. The cards merely reveal the situation at hand and point to possible outcomes.ts); Swords (Air, Spades, Angels, Ivy, Needles, Aristoi); Pentacles (Coins, Diamonds, Salt, Commerce).<br />Zondag associates the Yin/Yang principle with the cards.

Whether or not one thinks BLACK DOG is the most amazing book ever written or a run-of-the-mill mystery will undoubtedly be tied to one's perspective and prior reading experience. I have read mostly British mysteries (ALL of Sayers, Christie, James, Dexter, Ellis, Allingham, Walters, Hall, Hill, Robinson, etc.) as well as a few American writers (Cornwall, Evanovich). For me, although BLACK DOG is well written, it is a run-of-the-mill British mystery -- great for grabbing in an airport book store to while away the hours standing in the security lines or seated on airplanes. I would not place Booth in the top tier of recently &quot;arrived&quot; British mystery writers (i.e. Minette Walters) as some have. However, like Jill McGowan he shows promise of surviving the long haul without becoming a super star.<br />Booth's character development is comparable to Reginald Hill's (medium), although Ben Cooper is more akin to Peter Pasco than Dalziel. Ben Cooper has a future, but I don't find Diane Fry appealing. I think Booth would have done better to spend more time in Cooper's head and less in Fry's. Rare is the writer who can inspire a protagonist of the opposite sex. P.D. James succeeded with Adam Dalglish, but Dalglish is older like James, and older men and women tend to think more alike than not. Life simply wears one down around the edges and narrows the differences.<br />Booth's forensics events are familiar, particularly if you are a fan of Patricia Cornwell, who did a masterful job of explaining the progression of the decomposition of the human body in BODY FARM. I suppose every mystery/crime writer has to resort to forensics these days, but it gets tiresome to read about flies and maggots over and over. Booth is not gratuitous, however, and his descriptions of the material events surrounding the death of Laura Vernon are necessary to futher his storyline.<br />Anglophiles love the perspective that only Brits can share about their lives. BLACK DOG takes place in what appears to be an English village in or near Derbyshire in Central England. Most  Americans who travel to England don't see the life Booth describes--old established connections of the family members and friends; the varous types of housing, streets, and pathways; and other aspects of daily living such as the importance of dogs, manure, and pub life.  The ancectdotal bits are wonderful. I never understood the significance of the Black Dog before I read Booth's book, and now, maybe I do.hat appears to be an English village in or near Derbyshire in Central England.

I bought THE SIBLEY GUIDE TO BIRD LIFE AND BEHAVIOR for myself for Christmas. I wanted Sibley's Guide because I am an avid birdwatcher, interested in books, articles, films, etc. about birds. I had read glowing reviews about this book (here and elsewhere) and thought it must be the best bird book ever. Also, several reviewers noted that like JJ Audubon, Mr. Sibley was a gifted artist who depicted birds rather beautifully.<br />Sibley's Guide is a beautiful book bird watchers will want to add to their collection (hardcover, please). Those who already know the difference between Bewick's Wren and a Carolina Wren may appreciate Sibley's Guide more than those who can't tell a White Throated Sparrow from a pigeon. However, sooner or later every bird enthusiast needs to understand the ecology of birds, and this is the strength of the Sibley Guide.<br />I've been a bird lover since I was a child, and lucky enough to have parents and grandparents who were bird fanciers (my dad was an ecologist, my grandmother raised tamed birds). As a result, I know a great deal about birds and their environments. Sibley's book appeals to me because its central message is that all living things are connected and that the environment matters. One should never take the continuing presence of birds in the back yard as a given as their habitats are threatened.<br />The Sibley Guide is not as well suited for fieldwork as the Smithsonian's Handbook, BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA (regional versions), or THE AUDUBON BACK YARD BIRDWATCHER. For example, on p. 440, the Sibley guide has an illustration titled &quot;Troglodytid diversity&quot; which shows the very small Winter Wren and the very large Cactus Wren. The Smithsonian handbook contains separate entries for each of these birds (and many other wrens) and each entry has a separate map showing the individual bird's range. You will immediately know from the Smithsonian Guide that the Winter Wren has an Eastern and Northern range while the Cactus Wren is more likely to be found along the Southwest border and in Northern Mexico.<br />In contrast, Sibley's book contains a paragraph on &quot;habitats&quot; in the &quot;wren&quot; section and it says Winter Wrens can be found in the Pacific Northwest old-growth forests and the Cactus Wrens can be found in the Chihuahuan Desert. In an earlier part of the guide Sibley has described these areas with lovely maps. You can figure out the approximate ranges of each bird with a bit of page flipping, but you may not quickly deduce that the Winter Wren is also found on the East Coast.<br />The Sibley Guide is nifty because it groups birds based on DNA results and discusses them as well as their general ranges, habitats, food and foraging behavior, and various aspects of breeding. The Sibley Guide promotes a deeper understanding of the ecology of birds. You will not want to take the Sibley Guide to the field for birdwatching, however.more likely to be found along the Southwest border and in Northern Mexico. <br />In contrast, Sibley's book contains a paragraph on &quot;habitats&quot; in the &quot;wren&quot; section and it says Winter Wrens can be found in the Pacific Northwest old-growth forests and the Cactus Wrens can be found in the Chihuahuan Desert.

In the forward to CIVITAS TO KINGDOM, N.P. Brooks of the University of Birmingham suggests that K.R. Dark's new book may give the phrase \\"The Dark Ages\\" a new meaning. Using information from historical, archeological, and other sources available in the early 1990s, Dark has constructed a new interpretation of Britain in the years between 410 A.D. when the Roman Empire sent an official letter stating it could no longer defend the Britannia, and the germanization of most of Britannia by the Anglo-Saxons in the 800s.<br />Dark's study covers the provinces not immediatly subdued by the Angle and Saxon mercenaries the Romans hired to \\"protect\\" Britannia before 400 A.D. Non-Anglo-Saxon Britain included the nothern and central areas of the island, plus Cornwall and Wales. Dark says the inhabitants of this area maintained an 'Antique Roman Society' which combined political, economic and other aspects of pre-Roman and Roman eras.<br />Dark has assembled an enormous amount of information gleaned from recent historical studies (text anayses) and archeological studies as well as other sources. He asks, \\"What is Roman\\". After he lists and defines the characteristics most scholars agree are \\"Roman\\" he shows how material evidence supports the notion that the Roman Britannia survived what has been described as a barbaric Celtic era. One the other hand, he says, \\"the polities of Britain, tribes, civitates, or kingdoms, remained stable from the Pre-Roman Iron-Age to the sub-Roman period....the general picture is of overall continuity but not a static system...the conventional picture of the fifth-to-seventh-century 'Celtic West' as a reversion to Iron-Age cultural and political organization is mistaken.\\"<br />This is an excellent book, quite readable, and loaded with footnotes for those who wish to go further.	2001-12-27

THE WELL-TEMPERED GARDEN is a classic book, filled with all sorts of advice from one of Britain's leading garden experts--Christopher Lloyd.  Lloyd is responsible for Great Dixter, one of the premier gardens in England. WELL-TEMPERED GARDEN was first published in 1973, and this version is the new and updated and somewhat expanded version.<br />Whether or not the inexperienced gardener can use this book is debatable. GARDEN contains tons of information, but the paperback contains no photographs. Unless you are an experienced gardener who can picture the plant varieties Lloyd discusses, I would think GARDEN would prove more confusing than not. I am an experienced gardener and I found many interesting tips.<br />Lloyd is a plantsman, and he has a good deal to say about many of the plants generally found in gardens in the temporate regions of America as well as England, but his discussion is confined to examples of plants grown at Great Dixter (past and present, failures and successes).  I struggled through the text, trying to read it like a 'book', and then decided it made a better reference work. If you're interested so-called 'tricks of the trade' regarding garden staples such as tulips, peonies, pansies, primulas, or climbers, shrubs, and roses, you can find the item of interest in the index, locate it in the text and read about it.<br />Lloyd shares his accumulated wisdom about a large assortement of plants, providing the sort of information one usually finds only in specialty books on particular plants, not in a general gardening book. For example, he says, &quot;What is an azalea?&quot; He then goes on to discuss azaleas in terms of their botanical classification (they are rhodendrons), notes that there are many kinds of azalea, and suggests that one sort or another may work better depending on what you are attempting to do.<br />Many of Lloyd's comments are better suited to the gardener in England (lots of stuff on roses). However, he also discusses plants of interest to Americans. For example, his text concerning Buddleias is quite relevant for gardeners in the mid-Atlantic region. Lloyd suggests Buddleias are in the top flight of second-rate shrubs. They grow fast but are sadly sketetal in winter. However, he suggests, they are indispensible. He then goes on to discuss the different kinds of buddleias you might want to grow. I don't think he quite says why they are indispensible, but anyone who knows their colloquial name 'butterfly bush' knows why.<br />My sense of Lloyd is that he is like an old maiden aunt or bachelor uncle, full of information that could save you a bit of work and heartbreak if only he would 'spill the beans'. For the most part I have little idea why he's sharing what he's sharing (he starts his sentences in the middle), but every other paragraph or so he drops a gem.interest to Americans.

When I took a survey course on the history of Western Art, the instructor passed over the Etuscans in about 15 seconds. I belive he showed us one slide of the elaborate tomb of an Etruscan man who was reclined in death on the lid of his sarcophogus. In the instructor's mind, the Etruscans formed a brief interlude somewhere between the Greeks and the Romans.<br />My second encounter with the Etruscans came when I read D.H. Lawrence's book on his travels in Italy. In this book, Lawrence  includes an extensive section on his visits to the Etruscan sites in Italy. Lawrence viewed the Etruscans with sympathy, and interestingly, THE ETRUSCANS takes off from Lawrence's book.  Each section of this history is introduced by a passage from Lawrence who felt the Etruscans had been badly described by the Greeks and the Romans.<br />THE ETRUSCANS is a history book in the series on 'The Peoples of Europe' and the third in this series of synopses on various European ethnic groups that I have read. I intend to read more. I am not interested in becoming an expert on every group, but these books provide me with an overview that allows me to determine which distinct groups I might want to study futher.<br />Barker and Rasmussen have taken a wholistic approach in developing their text.  They eschew the boundaries of traditional discplines without destroying the integrity of each of these various appoaches. They use all &quot;sources, whether written records, inscriptions, monuments or excavated data...&quot;<br />The book is laid out by topic, and the discussions in each section are drawn from the work of scientists and historians who have deciphered text (tomb inscriptions and other preserved written material including the &quot;histories&quot; of the Romans and the Greeks) and subtext (geological formations, pottery shards; bone fragments from slaughtered animals; flora including petrified seeds; remains of metal implements, tools, jewelry, etc.; remains of various structures including houses, boats, etc.; disturbances in the terrain resulting from the construction of canals, roads, walls, mines, farms, and necropolises).<br />The tale Barker and Rasmussen piece together is amazing. Scientists and historians know much more than they did about the Etruscans owing to recent advanced work involving forensics type investigation. The authors suggest much more can be known if additional steps are taken in the study of preshistoric Etruscan sites, i.e. researchers need to adapt the advanced techniques used in other places like Israel.<br />The Etruscans apparently weren't great artists like the Greeks but they made a number of material advances the Romans simply incorporated and claimed as their own inventions. For example,  recent archeological research shows the Etruscans were engineers who invented the means of moving water via canals and irrigation channels long before the Romans built their aquaducts.<br />The Etruscans created a civilization that lasted longer than many others formed in Western Europe (800 B.C. to 300 B.C) and even after they were &quot;incorporated&quot; by the Romans they continued to make substantial contributions to the surrounding economy.<br />Apparently, the Etruscans were an archaic people, native to the part of Italy where their remains can be found. Although their language seems to be unlike that of most other historic Europeans the discovery of a Phoenician/Etruscan rosetta stone has allowed researchers to untangle a number of words, including the names of many of those laid to rest in the ornate tombs I was shown so long ago.ding houses, boats, etc.; disturbances in the terrain resulting from the construction of canals, roads, walls, mines, farms, and necropolises). <br />The tale Barker and Rasmussen piece together is amazing.

I'd hardly call this book of essays and poems soothing. Some of these folks are mighty disturbed. I don't think John Updike ever wrote anything I could call delightful--provocative, beautiful--but not delightful. And true to form, his essay is about the aftermath of a decision to divorce and his &quot;farewell&quot; to some leaves he's become intimately involved with via his study window is both beautiful and sad. Sylvia Plath scares the heck out of me and her essay &quot;Fable of the Rhododendron Stealers&quot; is a signature piece. Then we have Alice Walker's poem &quot;Revolutionary Petunias&quot; about a backwoods woman who raised a George, a Martha, a Jackie and a Kennedy, and Josephine Jacobson's &quot;Jack Frost&quot; is a bit nippy. Robert Graves (I, Claudius and The White Goddess) addresses the behaviour of avid composters in &quot;Earth to Earth&quot;.<br />No, this book is definitely not restful, but, it's really, really good. If you're a fan of the short story, particularly those with a twist you will like this book (including the O'Henry tale, &quot;The Last Leaf&quot;). If you're a fan of good poetry (Billy Collins anyone) you'll like this book. LEAF AND FLOWER is not about gardening per se, though gardeners like the old woman who attempts to bring beauty into sordid surroundings in Eugenia Collier's &quot;Marigolds&quot; are sometimes featured.<br />If I had to assign an organizing principle to this work, I would say this...every human life intersects with a plant at some critical juncture. OF LEAF AND FLOWER contains one of the most artistically assembled sets of essays and poems on the importance of flora for human beings.	2001-12-15

AELBERT CUYP is an art book developed in conjunction with the exhibit of Cuyp's work currently on view at the National Gallery in Washington (10/01-1/02), the National Gallery in London (2/02-5/02), and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam (6/02-9/02). If you want to get a head start on your visit to the exhibit (and avoid dragging home a heavy book afterward) you may want to buy the book beforehand. In addition to photographs of the paintings and drawings in the exhibit, the book contains five essays. My favorite is entitled &quot;Pigments and color change in the paintings of Aelbert Cuyp&quot; by Marika Spring.<br />Unlike many contemporary painters, Aelbert Cuyp died a wealthy man. He married well and he amassed a fortune in revenue from his patrons. He was frequently commissioned to paint family gatherings such as 'Portrait of a Family in a Landscape' which he may have developed in collaboration with his father Jacob.<br />Cuyp's patrons were conspicuous consumers who wanted their wealth noted in portraiture. Cuyp addressed this by painting their horses and clothing with exquisite detail. In an essay entitled, &quot;Cuyp's horsemen: what do the costumes tell us?&quot;, Emilie E.S. Gordenker traces the origins of the Hungarian-Turkish influence on the clothing Cuyp's models.<br />Many Hungarians attended school in the Netherlands in the 17th Century. These young men were heros because they had driven the Turks from the doors of Europe and saved Hungary for Protestant Christianity (much to the delight of the Protestant Dutch). Following their victory, the Hungarians adapted Turkish elements of clothing such as linen undershirts, hip-length tunics, and turbans. The Dutch upper classes made this remarkable new dress  the latest fashion. (Recall the oriental aspects of clothing in Rembrandt's paintings? Cuyp literally followed suit).<br />Cuyp (pronounced as &quot;cowpt&quot;) is best known by his bucolic landscapes filled with farm animals, particularly cows--cows in the river, cows in the barn, cows in the fields, cows in the woods, cows with herdsmen, and herdsmen with cattle. However, he was also a master horse painter (plenty of gentry and aristoi on horseback), and his maritime scenes are gorgeous. According to Spring, he introduced the &quot;yellow light&quot; of the Italian Renaissance to Dutch landscape painting. His views of lakes, rivers, and harbor scenes exude a peaceful, serene, and almost other worldly beauty. I particularly like 'Dordrect Harbor by Moonlight'.<br />The last part of the book contains an essay and reproductions of Cuyp's many realistic pen and ink drawings from the area around Dordrect.

DELIGHT is not a gardening book, it is a synopsis of a journal kept by a convalesing writer who happens to have a garden.<br />Ackerman lives and gardens in Ithaca New York, home of Cornell University and one of the most beautiful and idyllic college towns in the United States. In her book, Ackerman describes her life of privilage: swimming in her backyard pool with friends; riding her bike around town, along the lake, or into the countryside; collecting roses from her many and various garden beds (1,500 roses over the summer); resting in the bay window of her study to watch wrens house hunt and breed or hummingbirds whom she has named Ruby and Gizmo stop by for a snack from one of the various feeders she has hung; shopping at craft fairs; stopping by the garden center; and myriad other tasks.<br />Ackerman uses the four seasons to stucture her book--an overworked device that fails (A NATURAL HISTORY OF THE SENSES was much better organized).  A few passages are good--she's somewhat eloquent when it comes to describing birds--but mostly I found her writing irritating and repetitive. She too frequently makes use of cliched phrases and/or awkward metaphors. As an avid reader of books on gardening and nature, I found her thoughts unoriginal and uninspiring.<br />I recommend one consider resisting the beautiful cover of this book (which is relatively original and apparently matches the colors in the wall paper in Ms. Ackerman's study), and read THE INVITING GARDEN by Allen Lacy. Or if you are looking for book on gardening that is truly profound, try Jim Nollman's book, WHY WE GARDEN.	2001-12-08

Having read VINCENT VAN GOGH AND THE PAINTERS OF THE PETIT BOULEVARD, I regret I did not get to the exhibt in Saint Louis or Frankfurt where it closed in September 2001. This lovely book was created as an exhibition catalogue, but one does not need to have seen the exhibition to benefit from reading the informative essays or looking at copies of beautiful works by Van Gogh, Gauguin and other memebers of the self-styled &quot;Petit Boulevard&quot; artists group.<br />Essays on topics related to the subject are preceded by text written by the editor and exhibit curator, Cornelia Homberg, (&quot;Vincent van Gogh's Avant-Garde Strategies&quot;). Homberg suggests the 'petit boulevard' was both an avant garde artistic movement following the Impressionists and an actual commercial location in Paris at the end of the 19th Century. The Exhibit featured works by members of the avant garde group (Van Gogh, Gauguin, Seurat, Signac, Pissaro, Toulous-Latrec, Anquetin, Bernard and others &quot;petit&quot; artists).<br />Homberg challenges the notion that Vincent van Gogh always worked alone and that his art was a &quot;one-off&quot; as other critics have suggested. She says Van Gogh was a member of an artists colony located in the vicinity rue Lepic where he lived with his brother Theo (Montmartre area), that he may have coined the phrase &quot;Petit Boulevard&quot; (he discussed it with Theo in their letters following his removal to Arles), and he saw himself as a leader of this innovative group (which he hoped to bring to Arles as a &quot;brotherhood&quot; of artists).<br />In his essay entitled &quot;The Cultural Geography of the Petit Boulevard&quot; Richard Thomas describes the material dimensions of the place and time within which the &quot;petit boulevard&quot; artists worked. He describes the &quot;off-off-Broadway/Bourbon Street&quot; atmosphere of the bohemian artistic community -- a proletarian territory dominated by factories, caberets, taverns, le circque, brothels, and other down scale establishments (Chat Noir, Molin Rouge) where 'decadent iconograpy' was born. He says artists such as Toulouse Latrec, Steinlin, Willith, and others developed commercial prints depicting this mileau.<br />In the third essay, Elizabeth Childs describes the escape of Gauguin and Seurat to Pont Aven and Van Gogh to Arles following their Paris adventures. Here the artists hoped to reconnect with the timeless cycles of nature and leave the crass, commercial, class-ridden city behind. Childs says once Gauguin reached Pont Aven, the Celtic Catholic nature of Brittany spurred Gauguin to develop a medieval stain-glass cloisonnist style of art. She contrasts Gauguin's work with Van Gogh's 'rural' art which he based on a love of Japanese prints (by Hiroshege and others) and what he fancied to be Japanese culture, as well as the Barbizon style which included Daumier and Millet. In the last essay, John House discusses landscapes by Van Gogh (who influenced by his Dutch predecessor Rembrandt and the French Millet) as well as other artists of the period including Gauguin.<br />The book is filled beautiful reproductions of the paintings and other works included in the Exhibit (prints and photographs of the various items of art, the people involved, and the places they lived and worked). Sadly, one would have to do quite a bit of traveling to recapitulate the Exhibit, and then the synergistic effect would be missing. On the other hand, the book is a solid testament to the art that followed Impressionism. Although I had seen many of the paintings in their home museums (National Gallery, Chicago Art Institute, D'Orsay, Van Gogh Museum, etc.) I had not seen some of the works in private hands, nor the photographs of the period.

David Friedman's book A MIND OF ITS OWN: A CULTURAL HISTORY OF THE PENIS is excellent -- well researched and footnoted; parsimonious but amazingly thorough; humorous and frightening; enlightened and enlightening; and one of the most readable and well written books I've read in a while. I don't ordinarily read the publications Friedman writes for (GQ, Esquire, Village Voice, Rolling Stone) but I found his investigative reporter style smooth as silk and reminiscent of that of Andrew Sullivan whom I admire.<br />I would not have read this book except for it's intriguing cover and my ongoing interest in the subject of fertility (I wrote my Master's Thesis on the nexus between female fertility and labor force participation).  Following my reading of Clara Pinto Correra's OVARY OF EVE, and McElvaine's EVE'S SEED, this book seemed a natural fit, and Friedman has filled in some important remaining gaps in my education. I had no idea men took their penises so seriously. I recomend this book to sociologists, demographers, psychologists, urologists, and just about anyone who is interested in the penis or contemplating taking Viagra.<br />Gosh, I must be naive, but I had no idea men had suffered so much. I knew women had suffered and are still suffering all over the world (particularly in Muslim countries) but whereas women have suffered from the pain inflicted upon them (by men), men inflict pain -- on themselves, young boys, women, young girls and animals -- all for the sake of an erection it would seem. Reading this book requires a strong stomach.<br />Freidman has covered every possible angle from which the penis can be examined -- war, mythology, politics, physiology, poetry and literature, psychology, medicine, religion. He begins his book with an exploration into the perspectives of the ancients towards the penis -- Egypt and the Osirus myth (he lost his penis); Greece and the cult of male love (homo); Roman manhood (hetero and homo but only if one is the penetrator not the penatratee); the Bible (forget it), circumcision (ouch), Gilgamesh (off with it), the Jews (dead giveaway). Next comes the CHURCH from Augustine (forget it) and Julian the Orthodox (I wish I had been raised Orthodox); Thomas Aquinis and later the Protestants including those heads of the English Catholic Church -- Henry the VIII and James I (conflicted to say the least). Friedman then tackles science and medicine. He summarizes the work of Correra Pinto and other excellent sources who have written extensively on the history of human fertility research. He discusses the anatomical work of Leonardo da Vinci (is there anything he did not take apart??); He covers the Freudians (introspection and cocaine) including Stekel and other psychoanalysts who studied male frigidity; He summarizes the machinations of a raft of medical quacks, simpletons, sex-crazed misfits and other degenerates who did BAD things to unsuspecting males and females in the name of medicine and medical research.<br />The last part of the book, pure investigative journalism, is a succinct and well written summary of the search for a medical cure for impotence. He describes the involvement of academe and physicians with the drug industry; stock investors like Bill Gates and Ross Perot (and you thought it was a military-industrial complex!); the Viagra trials (yes, this drug is still being &quot;tried&quot; -- no one knows the long-term effects); and many other contemporary angles and issues including the feminsts perspectives on the topic of male penises.<br />I enjoyed the book and I'm glad I read it, but it left me a bit sad. I really hope and still believe that there are men who don't think the one-eyed-jack is the most important thing in the world -- a world where females and children are destitute, starving, in bondage, overworked and abused.ot the penatratee); the Bible (forget it), circumcision (ouch), Gilgamesh (off with it), the Jews (dead giveaway).

On Sunday, Novemeber 11, 2001, two months after the WTC and Pentagon disasters, the 'Washington Post' ran several articles concerning the future of Afghan women and all women living in Muslim dominated countries. One of these articles, entitled &quot;The Birth of the Myth That Men Are Closer to God&quot; by Robert S. McElvaine so intrigued me that I immediately ordered McElvaine's book EVE'S SEED from Amazon and read it.<br />I've been a feminist ever since my father told me I could not grow up and be a priest. I don't know why he said that, as I had never shown any interest in the vocation, but the mere fact that he told me I could not do something provoked me to ask why?  I've been asking why ever since, and though I left organized religion behind in a cloud of dust years ago, I still question the nature of the universe and my place in it, so, &quot;naturally&quot; I was intrigued with McElvaine's book.<br />McElvaine is a historian, but he has included information from related social science fields as well as snippets of science. In fact, his book is a HUGE synopsis of LOTS of material that includes world literature and myths; literature from the American woman's movement; the Bible plus various interpretations of Jesus message; demography; anthropology; history; and psychology. At times he is overly reliant on fellow social scientists who have been somewhat discredited (Margaret Mead, Ashley Montague, Freud). However, McElvaine's summaries also include some recent material from more reputable sources.<br />Although the book jacket categorizes McElvaine's book as 'Science/History' I would describe it as 'Woman's Studies/History/Religion'. Imagine a book entitled EVE'S SEED that discusses the science of human reproduction and fails to include material from THE OVARY OF EVE by Clara Pinto-Correia, especially when Pinto-Correia's book would have supported so many of McElvaine's contentions!! McElvaine also might have included better material to support his thesis that the &quot;two sexes&quot; are composed of biological organisms who form a bimodal distribution along a continuum. He mentions the disparities in male-female medical research, but fails to mention the most egregious example--the failure until recently to include women in the Framingham Heart Studies. (This latter is not an esoteric example. He cites Faludi's book BACKLASH over and over, and if I am not mistaken Faludi raises this point in her book.)<br />At the beginning of 1960s resurgence in the women's movement, I was young and naive and actually thought, &quot;Now the workplace will become a kinder, gentler place because women will bring their values to the office.&quot;  Wrong!! Instead, the workplace has masculinzed many women. To &quot;get ahead&quot; one must become competitive, agressive, and a sycophant with an ability to laugh at things that aren't funny. As McElvaine points out, Sigourney Weaver's character in the film &quot;Working Girl&quot; (noxious female executive) is closer to the real thing than the sniveling little Melanie Griffin. The female executives I have known are TOUGH cookies!! (Think Margaret Thatcher. Think Madeline Albright!! Think Hillary Clinton!!)<br />McElvaine's subtitle should have been &quot;Religion, the Sexes and the Course of History.&quot; Although he does not include any real science, McElvaine does a great job of tackling the way the Judeo-Christian-Isalamic religions have &quot;kept woman in her place&quot; even though it would seem this was NOT the Jesus message. In fact, Jesus is a hero in McElvaine's book (along with Gandi, Martin Luther King, and other 'gentlemen'). I never liked 'Saint' Paul, and now I know why. Seems those early male Christian writers interpreted Jesus to suit their needs. Cover your head indeed!! Old Law is Dead -- they never even heard the message!! It was women who first recognized Jesus as the Christ and women who first saw him after the resurrection!!<br />McElvaine does a fine job of articulating what he believes Jesus message really was (a feminine one about love) and how the church twisted it to suit its needs. McElvaine is not into Catholic bashing either. He points out that while Christianity was founded by a man of peace, Islam was founded by a man of war. He also says Calvin's Geneva was not a real great place for women and Martin Luther instructed his wife, a former nun, to stop singing the Ave Maria.<br />McElvaine's book falls into the category I call &quot;Pop&quot; social science, but it would be wonderful for use in American Studies, Women's Studies, Sociology, History, or Religious Studies classes because it is provocative reading that just might be correct--depending on how you interpret the &quot;facts&quot;.job of articulating what he believes Jesus message really was (a feminine one about love) and how the church twisted it to suit its needs.

Lawrence and Italy: Twilight in Italy; Sea and Sardinia; Etruscan Places (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)	Books	4	41	42	N	N	Journal of Italian travel....	D.H. LAWRENCE AND ITALY is composed of three stories: 'Twilight in Italy', 'Sea and Sardinia' and 'Etruscan Places'. The first  two &quot;books&quot; seem to be based on journals he wrote while traveling with his German born lover then wife Frieda, whom he refers to as q-b for queen bee, through various villages on the mainland of Italy and the island of Sardinia. Lawrence does not record his experience of &quot;famous&quot; sights in these two books, in fact he says he is not interested in historical places, museums etc. but rather he wishes to see the people and the places in the out-of-the way areas of Italy. He and Frieda travel by bus, train, and boat--close to the ground.<br />Those who have read Lawrence's fiction will recognize his writing. He describes what he encounters with a visceral language--people, clothing, food, establishments. Some of the places are stunning and some so filthy you wonder how he could have stayed overnight. He visits lemon and olive groves and various high places along the coast and in the interior valleys. His writing is graphic--the reader will be as appalled and enchanted. He reflects Italy just before and after WWI.<br />In the third book, 'Etruscan Places', Lawrence describes his visits to various Etruscan sites, including the painted tombs of Tarquinia. His writing is less descriptive than that of the first two books. He is concerned with nothing less than the meaing of life, and the conflict between religion and truth (he died a few short years later at age 44 so his reflections seem almost prescient). He muses that societies are organized around death or life. He speaks of the use of fertility symbols such as fish and lambs for Christians and dolphins and eggs for Etruscans; the significance of the color vermillion -- male body painting by warrior classes where red paint connotes power contrasted with the the red skin coloring of the Etruscan tomb portraits which seems to have connoted the blood of life. He says the Etuscans loved life and the Romans who subdued them loved power.<br />Lawrence's book provides good background for those who would know more about Italy. Many of the places he describes have changed since the 1920s--some for the better. The people have changed--their clothing, homes, etc. are less unique and colorful, but they are better fed, warmer in winter, and cleaner. Hopefully their lives are better, but I don't think Lawrence would agree.s loved life and the Romans who subdued them loved power. <br />Lawrence's book provides good background for those who would know more about Italy.

I collect art books and am particularly fond of Vincent Van Gogh, the fabulous Dutch artist of the 19th Century, who is probably the most popular of all artists--EVER (certainly my favorite!!). I have taken several art history courses with Van Gogh as subject, seen all the &quot;Van Gogh&quot; films, etc. I own many books about Van Gogh including a few I picked up in the Netherlands. What could anyone else possibly say about him that I have not already heard?  The answer as it turns out is plenty. I had not yet read Debora Silverman's VAN GOGH AND GAUGUIN: THE SEARCH FOR SACRED ART.<br />Silverman has taken a different tact in writing about the artists Van Gogh and Gauguin--who will linked together through eternity if for no other reason than the episode in Arles with Van Gogh's &quot;earlobe&quot; (not ear). Like many, I have wondered just why these two men behaved so antagonistically towards each other. I have heard about personality conflicts, differing life styles, and mental illness, but somehow these reasons have never resonated with me. The explanation for the Gauguin-Van Gogh conflict according to Silverman was owing to nothing less than their conflicting interpretations of the meaning of life.<br />Gauguin was raised Roman Catholic and attended a Catholic boys school where he was taught the theology of bearing one's cross and dying to the material world to attain the transcendent good--paradise. Van Gogh came from a humanistic Dutch Reformed background in an era when this church was focused on the need for a consolatary religion in the face of EVOLUTION. Their conflict seems to have been a feud of a particular kind as both men attempted to understand the eternal truths, grapple with the new reality of science, and abandon their relgious upbringings.<br />While Gauguin's paintings reflect the transcendent as &quot;otherworldly&quot; and point the way for later abstract symbolists such as Picasso, Van Gogh's works are tied to the sacred presence of the eternal in the natural world. In painting after painting, Gauguin flattens the canvas, uses paint sparingly and depicts scenes of misery and suffering, sin and redemption. On the other hand, Van Gogh focuses on the sacred nature of work and rural life--threshing, weaving, milking, and rocking the baby by the fireplace. Where Gauguin creates angels strugging with men and flying cows, Van Gogh paints wheat fields and grape vineyards filled with sowers, thrashers, and harvesters. Where Gauguin sees classical elements such as the three muses and a Greek temple and admires Delacroix, Van Gogh sees bridges, sailboats, looms, and walls, and adores Millet.<br />During their short time together in Arles, Gauguin sought to influence Van Gogh--to have him paint from memory, flatten surfaces, and introduce overt religious symbolism into his work. Van Gogh did partially adapt some of Gauguin's techniques such as cloisonism (black outlines separating flat patches of color), but while Gauguin continued to tackle the sinful ways of man (and apparently sin quite heavily when he wasn't working) Van Gogh adapted Zenlike techniques reminiscent of Hiroshege and other Japanese artists who saw no boundary between the divine and natural worlds.<br />Silverman writes beautifully (I read every word..this is a powerful book) and there are hundreds of drop-dead beautiful facsimilies of the works of Gauguin and Van Gogh. I think Silverman favors Van Gogh, and I do too so I was not disappointed (though she covers Gauguin quite well). She spends a great deal of time on style and technique, which I also liked very much. She is not merely pointing out technical differences, however, she is showing how their respective techniques were tied to their philosophical outlooks. Several &quot;sets&quot; of paintings by both men are discussed in detail--Van Gogh's Langlois bridge paintings (all nine are reproduced) and the Berceuse paintings (she who rocks the cradle); as well as Gauguin's repeated use elements such as the women of Brittany,  cows, angels, and &quot;the dead.&quot;<br />This is a wonderful book and if you love Van Gogh and want to better understand his painterly ways, you must have it.  It will enrich your life.ts such as the women of Brittany,  cows, angels, and &quot;the dead.&quot;<br />This is a wonderful book and if you love Van Gogh and want to better understand his painterly ways, you must have it.

1776486:US	51379338	R2DI9VZBD3NYW6	1580910688	521755094	The Complete Guide to Tarot	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Many points of view....	Hundreds of books have been written about the Tarot, and Eason's COMPLETE GUIDE is one of the more informed introductions. Eason has distilled a great deal of the extant knowledge of the Tarot in her book. In addition to her own interpretation of each card, she includes a compressed history of the Tarot, as well as a description of the various uses of these cards by groups such as Astrologers and Kabbalists. I don't think of her book as the &quot;complete&quot; guide, but it is filled with interesting material.<br />Following a brief history of the Tarot, Eason uses the 'natural' divisions of the deck -- a major arcana (Star, Devil, Tower, Hanged Man, Fool, Magician, Lovers) and a minor arcana (suits of face cards and numbers 1-10)-- as a means for organizing her discussion, which is clearly and succinctly written. She has illustrated each card with a facsimile from the Universal Waite deck created early in the 20th Century, so if you're trying to match a deck with a book you might look for this pack.<br />According to Eason, &quot;the Tarot is called the Arcana because it is said to teach truth through symbolic language older than any written records, a language carried in myth and song, and so enriched by successive generations.&quot;  Many great psychologists, social scientists, artists, and theologians have determined the ancient symbols have much to teach us about eternal truths. Eason's own rendering of the meaning of each Tarot card seems to follow a somewhat Jungian approach.<br />I personally find her approach useful for daily application and periodic readings (she shows you how to pull a card or do a spread). &quot;Readings&quot; are subjective, and whether you believe in the magical aspects of the Tarot cards or not (she includes a section on magic), the cards are useful for promoting self awareness. If these cards can do nothing else for you, they can facilitate your coming to terms with your own life (if you believe they can, they can).<br />Using the idea of the &quot;journey of the soul&quot; as an organizing principle, Eason describes each card of the major arcana as creative or receptive in terms of: inner power, external power; life; fate; mortality; light and darkness; dreaming and doing; and new horizons.<br />In a second major section, Eason discusses the &quot;suit&quot; cards -- face cards and numbers 1-10. I believe the Tarot cups are &quot;hearts&quot; in modern card decks and frequently tied to hearth and home (also represent water); the wands are &quot;clubs&quot; and seem to be connected to strife and striving (and tied to fire in some interpretations); the pentacles are &quot;diamonds&quot; and frequently tied to wealth (earth); and the swords are &quot;spades&quot; and tied to conquests and defeats (&quot;air&quot;). Eason makes some of these connections, and others can be found in various sources.<br />Whether you are a psychologist, writer, or someone looking for guidance, Eason's COMPLETE GUIDE TO TAROT is a good place to begin your journey.idea of the &quot;journey of the soul&quot; as an organizing principle, Eason describes each card of the major arcana as creative or receptive in terms of: inner power, external power; life; fate; mortality; light and darkness; dreaming and doing; and new horizons. <br />In a second major section, Eason discusses the &quot;suit&quot; cards -- face cards and numbers 1-10.

Laurie Cabot has written a very informed albeit highly condensed book on the topic of modern Witchcraft. Not the best--DRAWING DOWN THE MOON by Margot Adler is the best--but this is almost as good, and in many ways the two books complement each other. Like Adler, Cabot frequently appears on television and radio shows so her voice is attuned to the ear--clear, concise, informative, and articulate. And, she knows her subject.<br />Cabot's history of witchcraft is reasonably accurate, and unlike some, not hysterical, just factual. As a result, she gets the story straight, and considering she wrote her history in the late 1980s, and tons of recent historical research was done in recent years (much of it refutes and/or recasts works which would have been available to her when she wrote the book), she is quite good. Of course Ms. Cabot has other means of &quot;knowing&quot; about the past than by digging through musty tomes.<br />I particularly enjoyed her section on the science of witchcraft. As it happens, my husband has a physics background so I could turn to him and say is this so, and is this so, and is this so...to which he replied yes, yes, and yes.  I gained a great deal more insight into the workings of crystals and gems from Ms. Cabot and my husband. Take the clear quartz crystal. She says it emits energy. So I said to my husband, is this true to which he replied, sure, I once built a crystal radio. Quartz is a great conductor of energy (he works at the Patent and Trade Office today and patents computer related thingys, he used to work for AT&amp;T and before that he was with the Army Signal Corps).<br />For years my husband has been reading about the wholistic universe and I figured it was some old scientific fiction junk, and lo and behold, here's Ms. Cabot saying witches knew this stuff all along and it seems science is corroborating it. And, she's on the record as saying so before science &quot;discovered&quot; it.

PLACES OF GRACE consists of a series of stunning photographs by Gary Irving and an essay by Michal Strutin. The book covers states in the upper central plains--Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Ohio and Indiana, although as Strutin notes, some would include other areas.<br />Strutin asks--what is the American Midwest? She outlines what she thinks comprises the area and discusses the forests, wetlands, huge fresh water lakes, and prairie that can still be found throughout the region. She imagines what the first European explorers must have seen when they arrived. She says, for example, the word prairie is French for meadow. French explorers were the first Europeans to travel extensively through the American plains. They saw the amazing wide open spaces where grass grew 10 feet tall and lacking any other word, likened it to their own grass meadows back home. The French named many places from Des Moines to Des Plains.<br />Strutin says conservationists are working to restore parts of the prairie to their natural state. She explains some of the research involved in determining the correct proportions of Asclepia (Butterfly Weed); Echinacea; Daisy; and other flora in a region that contains one of the three major U.S. flyways for birds, butterflies and other migratory animals.<br />PLACES also contains photos and text about non-prairie areas in upper Michigan and Wisconsin where hugh forests once existed as anyone who has ever read Laura Ingalls Wilder's LITTLE HOUSE IN THE BIG WOODS or heard of Paul Bunyun knows.  Even today this area is a source of timber and home to many paper mills, though a good deal of the timber is being recovered from the bottom of Lake Michigan where it landed a century ago.<br />Irving and Strutin could have called their book HIDDEN PLACES OF GRACE. There are many wonderful nooks and crannies that somehow escaped the developer's axe, and today are protected in one way or another. This is an interesting and beautiful book.book.	2001-11-03

Over a lifetime, I've cultivated an interest in late 18th Century Europe, especially the French Revolution and it's aftermath. I've watched BBC productions on the topic (fiction and nonfiction), read real history books, read historical fiction, traveled to numerous places where hair-raising events took place, taken college courses, and in 1989 on the 100th anniversary I took a week of annual leave to attend a conference on the French Revolution at Georgetown University.<br />I thought this book would fall into the historical fiction category I appreciate--heavily laced with real facts and enlivened with dialogue that might have taken place if someone had been there to record it. To some extent the book fulfilled my expectations, and I must admit I read it in several successive sittings as it contains many interesting passages.<br />I appreciated Redfern's &quot;inside&quot; coverage of the events surrounding the failed attempt by the Chevalier de Tinteniac (a French Royalist) who attempted to win back his country via a British-backed invasion of Brittany; 2)I also enjoyed her coverage of the exciting world of astronomers in the late 1700s who still believed Titius mathematical theory concerning the placement of the planets in our solar system was correct.<br />However, I did not enjoy Redfern's &quot;murder mystery&quot; which she apparently tacked onto an interesing tale already bursting at the seams. The book is simply too busy. There are too many characters, too many subplots, too many acts of treachery, too many corrupt individuals, and too many murders. As I read, I felt as if I was watching a speeded up film.<br />In spite of the overload of detail, or maybe because of it, before the middle of the book I identified the killer, the mystery woman, and the traitor in the British Home Office. So, I am not sure there was a mystery after all. However, with so many corpses strewn about one must wonder.<br />So many of the characters proved to be untrustworthy and downright corrupt that I felt very depressed by the end. If you are looking for something to improve your outlook on life or raise your spirits in these sad times--don't read THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERESand downright corrupt that I felt very depressed by the end.

A number of years ago, I made my first trip to Europe during the off season--the colder months. The days are shorter, but the museums are less crowded, you can usually find a reasonable air fare, and the Europeans have returned to their cafes and pubs giving them an ambiance missing when too many tourists are about.<br />I enjoy photography, and I particularly like shooting architecture and gardens. I've taken plenty of shots when the foliage and flowers were in full bloom, but until I made my first trip to Amsterdam one December, I had never realized churches, cathedrals, and fine old houses and gardens have an entirely different look in winter. One can see and photograph the structures of buildings and the &quot;bones&quot; of gardens when foliage dies back.  &quot;Bones&quot; of course are the underlying design of the garden beds, plus trellises, porticos, arbors, paths and pots. Not only can one see more of the archtecture of the garden in the middle of winter, but the well constucted garden is not dead. I came to understand what the European Christmas carol, &quot;Lo, a rose er'e blooming&quot; was about after a visit to a garden in the middle of winter--the Christmas rose is a type of Hellebore, and Hellebores can bloom all winter long.<br />But Hellebores are not the only interesting plant. As Rosemary Veery says in her book, THE GARDEN IN WINTER, some plants such as the Rosa chinensis, Viola, Bergenia, Anemone, and Cyclomen, bloom intermittenly throughout the winter, and there are &quot;characteristic&quot; winter-bloomers such as many types of bulbs, Camellias, Arbutus, and Buddleja.<br />Veery says beauty in the winter garden is not restricted to flowers. Plenty of trees, bushes, and grasses provide color, form, and texture thoughout the winter winter months, and some of them are stunning in a snowfall. Depending on your growing zone you may have Holly, Viburnum, Nandina, Pyracantha, and Barberry covered with berries for the birds. Many trees have beutiful bark that shows best in winter including Crepe Myrtle, Sycamore, Birches, and Red-Twig Dogwood (Cornus alba 'Siberica'). Other trees have interesting shapes that can only be appreciated when the foliage is spent, such as Harry Lauder's Walking Stick. And, there are grasses in every size, shape and texture, and ground covers that stay green or red or brown throughout the growing seasons.<br />Veery is one of the premiere gardeners in England, and although you may find some of her suggestions beyond your pocketbook or the space you have available (box topiary anyone??) you will find many interesting ideas and wonderful photographs that are sure to inspire you to begin thinking about gardening all year round. You might also be inspired to visit some of the gardens Veery pictures in her book, or other gardens closer to home in winter.

I've been enchanted with birds ever since I observed my parents whistling and mocking the mockingbirds who mocked them back. I've been a gardener forever, cursing those creepy caterpillers who devoured this and that. In the past few years I've taken a greater interest in butterflies, and lo what do I discover...the creepy caterpillers turn into the beautiful butterflies if the birds don't eat them first. I knew that of course because like lots of kids, I too brought home the cocoon found on some branch and kept it in a glass jar with holes punched in the top until it did not &quot;hatch.&quot; Yes, I said did NOT. I never had any success with this effort so I forgot about caterpillers and cocoons--until I opened STOKES BUTTERFLY BOOK and there are those darn cocoons again.<br />This is a wonderful book for adolescent children who can read big words and like big type or older people with vision problems.  The pictures are colorful and closeup and the type large enough that my aunt can see it under her &quot;reading&quot; machine&quot; (she has diabetes and is sight impaired).<br />The book is filled with all sorts of interesting information about the behaviour of butterfiles (basking in the sun to warm up their wings, puddling to suck up nutients; courting and laying eggs --surprise there are two sexes, just like the birds).  There are also lots of photos of their predecessors--the caterpillers who require a daily ration of greens to grow up into beautiful bugs.<br />Now I must admit it is about time that I realized that every orange and black butterfly I see is NOT a Monarch, but goodness there are so MANY orange and black butterfiles will I ever be able to tell them apart?  Some are Crescents and Checkerspots (in my neck of the woods which is the East Coast) and there are Admirals. Goodness--Monarchs, Admirals, Viceroys--I had no idea there was an aristocracy of butterflies.<br />I intend to use this book with my granddaughters who love to walk in grandma's garden and learn the names of plants and bugs and birds. Now we'll learn the names of caterpillers and their reincarnations who form an intermediate link in the food chain.n and learn the names of plants and bugs and birds.

Day after day many of us read about the destruction of our planet: farm land covered over with environmentally unfriendly golf courses and asphalt or destroyed by huge pesticide driven agribusinesses; water supplies contaminated with arsenic and ecoli; air polluted with everything from asbestos to zinc; wetlands destroyed by pesticides and developers; dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico; old growth forests pillaged by greedy corporations; and thousands of species of plants and animals on the brink of extinction including the Orca Whale symbol of the West Coast Indians.<br />GARDENING FOR THE FUTURE briefly describes these destructive practices (and cites Al Gore's EARTH IN THE BALANCE) but it also shows us a better way. You should continue to support those organizations waging the good fight in Washington and elsewhere -- AND buy this book, read this book, and light one candle by turning your own yard into a living example of a better way. You can do it. I've done it and it works.  Not only that, once you get your yard converted you will never have to mow grass again.<br />I've been farming organically for ages and had encountered and put into practice many of the ideas put forth in this book but this book brings all these ideas together.  The authors have assembled thoughts of the &quot;experts&quot; in fighting the environmental battle on the homefront--your yard. Think Victory Gardens. Each of us can make a contribution to the &quot;war&quot; effort. Each of us can begin to turn our garden plots, no matter how big or small, into a &quot;piece of the action&quot; -- gardening for the future of the earth.<br />You can grow vegetables organically and replenish the soil and eschew the use of pesticides and herbicides and other killers -- I know I've done it. And, I've done it in on a several acre spread out in the countryside.  My neighbors who had abandoned the &quot;old ways&quot; for modern chemcial solutions looked on in awe as the bad bad bugs beat a hasty retreat from my garden to theirs.<br />But most important, as Paul Mueller, one of the experts cited in this book says, &quot;Gardening is not just about having tomatos and peppers and flowers -- Gardening is about empowering -- planting a seed and watching it grow -- no matter who you are it makes you richer and deeper and more understanding of all the cycles of the universe and of your relationship to them.&quot;<br />The authors describe their contributors as the &quot;Dream Team&quot; Bill Mollison (Tasmanian permaculture expert); John Jeavons (soil growing in very small spaces); Masanobu Fukuoka (a plant pathologist promoting natural farming); Alan York (a viniculturist involved in biointensive gardening); Alan Kapuler (a biologist and Seed Exchanger); and Wes Jackson of the Land Institute.<br />This book is filled with ideas and plenty of practical examples. Everything from garden design to plant breeding is covered by numerous experts. You don't have to be a genius or work 12 hours a day to make this happen. The only thing you give up is that awful environmentally unsound lawn. I've done it.  My neighbors are doing it.

THE WICCAN PATH by Rae Beth consists of a series of letters Rae Beth wrote to two friends who wanted to know more about Wicca. Her correspondence is not very different from exchanges I have had with various friends over the years -- a Christian Scientist friend who explained her religion to me via phone calls and letters, a Quaker friend who explained her religion to me over various meetings for coffee, and a Morman male friend I saw for over a year when I was younger (and did not marry) who explained his religion to me.<br />I read voraciously about religion--histories, documents, letters, books, and other material. Although I was raised Christian in a Protestant-Catholic household, my mother and maternal grandmother attended seances every Friday night, and my maternal grandfather was descended from Dutch Jews. Knowledge of my family's mixed religious affiliations caused me a great deal of concern when I was a child because I was sent to Catholic schools where I was taught only RCs could enter heaven. I have tried to understand other religions ever since.<br />Like other reviewers of Rae Beth's book, I have read Scott Cunningham, Raven Grimassi, Silver Ravenwolf, and many others and I enjoy what they have written. Rae Beth is the first Wicca who &quot;spoke&quot; to me on a personal level however. These days, I find myself growing closer and closer to this ancient system of beliefs. Wicca is a lovely practice that operates from the perspective of attraction, not promotion.<br />I can continue to celebrate the holidays I grew to love as a child -- Father Christmas or Santa Claus; the Green Man (who may be Robin Hood or the Holly King); The Lady (Mary for me and Kuan Yin for others); Jesus (the Lord and the great Magus -- a Hindu friend tells me she believes Jesus one of the incarnations of Shiva); the Great Spirit; and all my saints who are not lost including Saint Anthony who has helped me recover more than one lost thing and who probably had previous incarnation as some deity or other. I believe in a higher power, and I don't think anyone has the final answer (well Shirley McLean may).<br />This is a wonderful soothing book written by a gentle soul who is fully in touch with her own nature and the natural world around us. The best part of Rae Beth's discussion for me is in part two where she explains how to go into a trance. As she puts it, you can do it many ways, even with rosary beads.on as some deity or other.

I own and have read all Allen Lacy's books and recommend them to anyone who wants to be better acquainted with the how-to aspect of gardening. I also recommend Lacy's books to those who seek a deeper experience with the natural world. Allen taught philosopy for years, and although his books mainly focus on horticulture, he includes relevant historical antecedents and existential angles in his writing that may help one better understand why humans imagine paradise is a garden.<br />I read THE INVITING GARDEN when it was first published a few years ago, but it is as timely and relevant today as it was when it was first published--why it has been reprinted. Compared with his other books, TIG contains many more photographs and much less text, but the photographs are some of the most beautiful I have seen in a garden book, and I am a garden book junkie.<br />Because many of his garden shots include children, the book is a real pick-me-up. Lacy shows his own granddaughter on his deck in New Jersey, a little boy poking branches into the soft bottom of a creek bed, and children here and there in various gardens in the U.S. and Europe. I especially like the shot of a very little girl with her arms around a huge tree at Versailles. With her feet placed on a protuding root, she is poised as if she is about to climb the tree, which is at least five feet across at the base. The imagination of children is a wonderous thing, but it also opens up my imagination and helps me appreciate why trees figure so prominently in human mythology and religion. Lacy has written elsewhere that he thinks trees are sentient beings and I do to.<br />Lacy has organized his book according to the five human senses.  Chapters cover the garden and the sense of sight (there are many beautiful shots of gardens around the country and in England and France); smell (shots show flower examples from Roses to Nicotiana (flowering tobacco), shrubs like Winter Jasmine, and herbs (one photo shows a box garden in Charleston with Rosemary accents); touch; taste; and hearing.<br />Hearing?? What can one hear in the garden?  Well to start with of course one can hear bird calls, buzzing bees, and wind chimes. But one can also hear the breeze blowing through high trees and grasses, as well as the burbling of water in a creek or manmade pond. Photos from a garden in California show a clay face mask lying underwater on the floor of a pond. Moss grows over the mask and bubbles of air pass through mouth to make lovely gurgling sounds (according to Lacy). In another shot, a clay mask is positioned among grasses so that the wind passing through emits a whispering sound.<br />Whether you garden or not, this wonderful book can help you push away the blues.n in Charleston with Rosemary accents); touch; taste; and hearing. <br />Hearing??

In the epilogue of THE CONSTANT GARDENER, John LeCarre says the story he he has just told is not completely truthful. The truth is worse. He points to the recent death in Kenya of Father John Kaiser, an American priest from Minnesota who had spent many years ministering to the needs of Kenyan Christians and was found dead of a bullet wound to the head fifty miles northwest of Nairobi.<br />I think THE CONSTANT GARDENER can be compared to THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  Like the PATIENT, GARDENER is lyrical at times, and it is also composed of two stories: one a tale of true love (doomed from the first pages) and the other a tale of death and destruction brought about by greedy government officials of both the European and African persuasion, large corporations, ambitious politicians, and religious fanatics.<br />Lest one think this is a diatribe against Western capitalism, let me hasten to say LeCarre goes to some pains to point out the existence of BUKO Pharma-Kampagne of Bielefed Germany, which is dedicated to separating the goats from the lambs in the pharmaceutical industry, and revealing the misdeeds of the former in the third world while pointing to the \\"good\\" deeds of the latter. Think of BUKO as the OMB of the drug world.<br />.<br /><br />I did not find the love story and it's end as wrenching as that in PATIENT, though the scene at the morgue is terrible enough. The main character, Justin Qualye, has something of George Smiley about him. Although the rest of the world thinks his wife has been unfaithful, he doggedly pursues the truth and ignores what others say. In the end, he finds he really did not know his wife Tessa, but he has been able to reconstruct a picture of her and she is with him in spirit. Whether he is delusional with grief or she is a spirit guide or both the reader must judge.<br />Although the book deals with pressing social issues (that unfortunately I am too familiar with because of my work), many may not be aware of them. If LeCarre succeeds in raising conciousnesses good for him. Unfortunately, many people think the people of Africa are expendable. Sadly, as elsewhere in the world, Muslim extremists are making things worse in Sudan, Nigeria, and other parts of Africa. The role of the United Nations in this tale is sadly accurate. The ray of light seems to be that those who would help Africa have finally realized it's salvation lies in the hands of women.ds in raising conciousnesses good for him.

A YEAR IN OUR GARDENS by Nancy Goodwin and Allen Lacy is a chatty exchange of letters and faxes between two old friends, both of whom have many years of gardening experience to their credit. Ms Goodwin ran Montrose Nursery for many years and is very informed and informing about plants -- native, cultivated, imported, and home-grown.<br />Dr. Lacy has written many books about gardening and garden design -- centered on his garden in New Jersey and other gardens futher afield. My personal favorite of Lacy's books is THE GARDEN IN AUTUMN, although THE INVITING GARDEN is probably his best selling book. I wouldn't recommend A YEAR IN OUR GARDENS to the novice gardener since it has no colorful photographs and a plethora of Latin named flowers and plants. Even the intermediate gardener searching for tips might find THE INVITING GARDEN a better read.<br />If you've been gardening awhile and like to read about green adventures from the comfort of your easy chair or need a good book for bedtime reading, you'll probably enjoy A YEAR IN OUR GARDENS. To me it's something of a cross between the books by Elizabeth Lawrence and Beverly Nichols. In fact, if Lawrence and Nichols had written to each other their conversations might have been a bit like the conversations of Goodwin and Lacey.<br />Goodwin and Lacey both had an affilitation with Duke University as did Elizabeth Lawrence though neither Goodwin nor Lacey is a botonist like Lawrence. Lacey wrote garden columns for the Wall Street Journal and New York Times and until recently taught philosopy and horitculture at Richard Stockton College in New Jersey where he lives and gardens. Lawrence's father was Lacey's professor of English at Duke University, and Lawrence lives and gardens near Hillsborough NC.<br />Both Goodwin and Lacey have gardens in growing zone 7.  As they relate their experiences over the course of the year, it becomes obvious this counts for little. Lacey lives near the Atlantic, has sandy soil he must amend with humus, and experiences milder summers and colder winters. Goodwin lives in the NC piedmont, gardens in clay, and has hot-hot summers. Both have green houses that allow them to cultivate a variety of plants more suited to tropical climates. Lacey tends to grow many plants in pots on a large extended deck, while Goodwin has a much larger property with room for numerous shubs and trees and a woodland garden.  Lacey says he prefers summer months for gardening, and Goodwin says she prefers anything but summer.<br />In addition to the exchange about plants, garden design and the various wildlife sightings, both correspondents share the ups and downs of daily living. Over the course of a year, Lacey undergoes major surgery and Goodwin's husband has eye surgery and her father dies. Both Godwin and Lacey travel to various locations to give lectures and undergo interviews on television and radio.  Martha Stewart drops by for a fifteen minute tour of Montrose, and Lacey goes to Disneyland.<br />All in all this book is mildly entertaining, and a peek into the lives of two relatively well educated gardeners.with humus, and experiences milder summers and colder winters.

My parents used stone in a variety of ways in their gardens. My father laid out walkways and patios using blue flagstone and built an outdoor grill (chimney and all) of field stones he collected on his travels through the mountains where we lived. He lined the ravine behind our house where the grill was situated with stones, including a series of stone steps down into the ravine. The banks of the ravine became a rock garden loaded with all sorts of bulbs, ground covers, ferns and low shubs, and small trees overhung with larger trees above.<br />I had not thought about my father's handiwork in many years, not until I bought STONE IN THE GARDEN by Gordon Hayward. Hayward's book is absolutely lovely, and even if you never build a thing using stone you will enjoy all the wonderful photographs he has included in his book showing stonework he found in the gardens of folks like Frederick McGourty, Tasha Tudor, and a host of other garden writers and enthusiasts. He has captured shots of gardens from Japan to England, France to Canada, and New England to the American Southwest.<br />Stones frequently form the basis of the &quot;bones&quot; of the garden -- structures that every good gardener incorporates. While fences and arbors and other structures can be made of wood, stone also fills a niche and is frequently a more appealing, practical, and long-lasting material. Hayward's book includes numerous ideas for using stone. Chapters cover garden walls and retaining walls, walkways, ponds, streams, outdoor areas with stone benches designed for contemplation, rock gardens, rock sculpture, and many other features.<br />A third of Hayward's book covers a series of step-by-step procedures for constructing walkways, walls, ponds and pools, and other useful structures.

THE EARTH IS MY MOTHER is the tale of a girl named &quot;Star&quot; -- a spunky 11-year and a true heroine. EMM has been beautifully illustrated by Bev Doolittle--known for her &quot;camouflage&quot; Native American and wildlife artwork. Since millions of dollars from the proceeds of Ms. Doolittle's works have gone to support the National Wildlife Federation, you can imagine the major theme of this book is the preservation of the wilderness. The storyline is based on Ms. Doolittle's concept but the text was actually written by Elise Maclay, author of two books of poetry, &quot;Approaching Autumn&quot; and &quot;Green Winter.&quot;  EMM is a feast for the ear and the eye.<br />I cannot praise this book enough as it reflects all my core beliefs--that girls can be strong, brave, and caring individuals, that traditional cultures have much to teach us, that we are all part of the great circle of life, and that we are made from stardust and the earth is our mother.<br />As a childhood fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's stories, Thorton Burgess' &quot;Old Mother West Wind&quot; tales, and fan of American Indian traditions and lore as well as a lover of the great outdoors, I was pleased to discover a book I could hand to my granddaughters with these words, &quot;You want to know what life is about? read this book.&quot;	2001-09-29

Ann Pember, author of PAINTING CLOSE-FOCUS FLOWERS IN WATERCOLOR has a BFA from the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston in fashion design and illustration. Before she became a free-lance illustrator, she worked as a commercial artist for many years. Photos in her book show the professional studio where she works. Technically, her work is nearly perfect.  I don't particularly care for her rendering of her subject matter as it stikes me as too &quot;commercial&quot; and not very painterly at all, but much can be learned from her book if you have had no other exposure.<br />Ms. Pember's background in fashion design and illustration are apparent in her work. She takes the reader from photographs of flowers to watercolors of those photographed flowers in several steps. She reveals how the eye is attracted by asymetry (offsetting of the center) and the placement of elements; how backlighting and focused lighting affect the appearance of the subject; how surfaces and background affect the paint and matter in the execution of a watercolor. She spends some time addressing color, but Ms. Pember is not a colorist.  She is more concerned with line and the arrangement of elements in a design.<br />The end result from my perspective are flowers that are somewhat overcontrolled, although she gives the unpracticed eye the exact opposite impression.  In the end, her flowers are contrived and not original. The watercolorist can acquire some interesting tips for creating pleasing paintings, but if producing art for commercial purposes is not your goal you may find Pember's book less rewarding.	2001-09-29

Different artists depict flowers differently and not all of them appeal to my eye. I am very much attracted to Sharon Hinckley's painting style. I am a fan of the bright colors of Gauguin and the vivid up-close and personal semi-abstract flowers of Georgia O'Keefe, and although they both mostly worked in oils, I think Hinckley has merged elements of both of their styles with her own and produced some wonderful watercolor painting.<br />Watercolor painting is more difficult than oil painting because you can't really paint over your mistakes without making a mess. Hinckly not only explains how to create flowers step by step (beginning with a discussion of the appropriate supplies and an explanation of color), she shows the reader how to make what she describes as &quot;leaf soup&quot; which forms the basis of the foliage in her watercolors. Hinckly says while many would-be artists can create flowers, most have difficulty with the stuff that grows with flowers, i.e. leaves, stems, and bark. One photo shows Hickley's palette, &quot;leaf soup&quot; mixture.<br />There are many books on the market offering instruction on &quot;how to&quot; draw-paint flowers, but if you are fond of the &quot;colorist&quot;  approach to painting, you may find it hard to beat the techniques described in WATERCOLOR BASICS, PAINTING FLOWERS.	2001-09-29

At one point in his novel THE HOURS Michael Cunningham uses the image of the Venus Flytrap to illustrate the dilemma of one of his characters, a poet named Richard who is dying of AIDS. First the flower lures you in and then its sharp &quot;teeth&quot; close over you and suck out your life's juices. At the end of THE HOURS I felt as if I had been lured into the book and drained of emotion, if not life juices.<br />I often read books that win prestigious prizes because I believe literary experts who know a good deal more about literature than I do serve on the panels that award prizes and I might be better informed if I try to read some of their choices. Often the experience of reading a prize-winning book is a delight (THE SHIPPING NEWS). Sometimes it is powerful (A THOUSAND ACRES, COLD MOUNTAIN). And sometimes the prize winning book isn't as good as the runner-up.<br />THE HOURS is extremely well written, and for that reason alone you may want to read it. Cunningham certainly shares some of his insights about the frustrating business of creative writing. However, THE HOURS is not a 5-star book from my perspective.<br />Cunningham combines three short stories into the one novel. He cleverly links not only the lives of his protagonists, but as another reveiwer has indicated, he links various illusions and aspects such as color. As a gardener, I noted the placement of roses in each of the tales--roses surround the dead thrush; roses missalinged and destroyed on the birthday cake; roses in the apartment of the poet dying of AIDS. This linking is seamless and at times beautiful.<br />However I want character development when I read a novel and I found Cunningham's characters a bit one-dimensional. One would expect more emphasis on plot in a short story--and this book consists of three short stories with three cleverly interwovan plots.<br />Although I appreciate the innovation of her work very much and feel she was overlooked by critics who latched onto James Joyce and ignored her because she was a woman writer, I have never particularly liked Woolfe's books. I read MRS DALLOWAY during a course I took on women writers (and afterward I read the remainder of her books). I've also read several biographies about Woolfe, including Quentin Bell's VIRGINIA WOOLFE:A BIOGRAPHY. (Bell appears briefly in THE HOURS).<br />The evidence from Bell's biography and another biography by Louise de Salvo, is that Virginia Woolfe was a victim of familial incest. The residual stress from her childhood encounters with older abusive brothers, the stress of losing several loved ones in quick succession in her early adult years, the destruction of the young men of her generation during WWI, and the disasters of WWII appear to played a major role in driving her mad.<br />When Virginia Woolfe walked into the Ouse, she had been bombed out of her London home and faced a bleak uncertain future in war-torn England. Leonard Woolfe was Jewish, and they both feared an invasion since their &quot;country&quot; home lay not far from the South coast of England and they knew what the NAZIs were doing to Jews. Many things affected her already fragile mind the day she packed her coat pockets with stones and waded into the river.<br />None of this information is revealed in THE HOURS. I can imagine someone reading THE HOURS, not knowing Woolfe's background, and thinking her a vain, shallow, and unstable aristocrat who had little serious regard for anyone. In reality, she was a deeply passionate and caring individual who knew too much sorrow. Knowing this, one must wonder about the other women in Cunningham's novel.d ignored her because she was a woman writer, I have never particularly liked Woolfe's books.

BUTTERFLY GARDENING is a collection of interesting essays about butterflies.  Chapters cover gardening tips, including an annotated list of plants that attract butterflies, and various other butterfly related topics such as: &quot;What do butterflies see?&quot;; &quot;The struggle to survive&quot;; &quot;The life cycle of the large white butterfly&quot;; and &quot;Moths in the garden at night.&quot;  If you love butterflies, you will probably enjoy this book but it won't go a long way toward helping you identify the Red Admiral you spotted on the Frikartii Aster yesterday. Another reviewer referred to this as a starter book, but I don't think of it as that at all although it does introduce a number of important topics.<br />The book includes a few &quot;designs&quot; for butterfly gardens, but they are general, and you would do better to use the garden designs in THE AUDUBON BACKYARD BIRD WATCHER.  Let's face it, where the birds are is where their dinner is and dinner for birds is often the larval stage of moths and butterflies. The plant lists in BUTTERFLY GARDENING are adequate. Certainly the best thing to plant is Buddleia..the butterfly bush.  This morning I saw three Monarch butterflies on my lavendar flowered Buddleia.  The bush also supports a Grandpa Otts morning glory vine which produces flowers that are a dark bluish purple which changes to a purplish magenta. The butterflies were flitting from flower to flower and the color combo was a knockout.<br />This little book has much to recommend it.  From BUTTERFLY GARDENING I learned the value of Parsley for larvae and that no matter how many butterfly boxes one hangs the little critters are visitors not tenants.	2001-09-16

THE SWEET BREATHING OF PLANTS should be required reading for high school and early college classes covering the natural world. I'm a big fan of essays, books, etc. written by naturalists, and SBP is one of the best collections of essays I've come across. The editors, Linda Hogan and Brenda Peterson have included the works of leading scientists such as Rachel Carson and Jane Goodall, but they've gone beyond the tried and true and compiled a collection of essays by many other scientists, naturalists, veternarians, and very wise women including Susan Orlean who recently produced THE ORCHID THEIF.<br />The golden rule of nature seems to be cooperation, not competion. SCIENCE magazine once published an article entitled &quot;Nature Red in Tooth and Claw&quot; and while a good deal of consumption takes place in the natural world, symbiosis is far more important. Nature is bigger than the &quot;survival of the fittest.&quot; Many plants and animals have symbiotic relationships. I think my favorite example is the dandelion which pulls calcium to the surface which allows other plants to thrive. In the plant world, having a dandelion for a neighbor can be a good thing good.<br />Native Americans in the Amazon riverine forests have not lost touch with nature. They understand that partially submerged trees feed the fish, and that they must build their gardens in the forest and away from the river banks which are exposed in the dry season. Contrast this attitude with that of the inhabitants of the Sierra who are felling trees in old growth forests as fast as they can. The regrowth is never the same. As one writer who used to work for the U.S. Forest service explains, the name of the game is to replace the living forest with a single tree. Monoculture seems to be more economically sound.<br />But is it economically sound to destroy the environment including the old growth forests? A growing body of evidence suggests this is not the case and much of it is contained in this book.  A good deal of money (if that is all that matters) can be made from keeping the forests entact. Medicinal plants yet to be discovered live in the forest. Recreation including sight-seeing, fishing, and other &quot;noninvasive&quot; outdoor sports are an important source of income.<br />One of my favorite essays was written by Donna Kelleher, a veternarian who practices holistic medicine. In her essay entitled, &quot;Living Medicine for Animals&quot; Kelleher writes of her experiences with animals, including Chirpy, a pet bird who suffered from a claw infection of Staphylococcus bacteria. Kelleher treated Chirpy with a mixture she concocted consisting of Calendula and other herbs after conventional forms of treatment failed to help Chirpy. The little bird was healed and lived two more years untile he died of old age.<br />This book of essays should not be overlooked.  If you think you've read it all you probably haven't.  Although much of the information in this book can be found elsewhere (most of the authors have written extensively on their topics), this is a nice anthology of essays and a good place to start discovering all the natural world.A good deal of money (if that is all that matters) can be made from keeping the forests entact.

In this day of working away from home, shopping after work and fixing a meal on the run, THE ART OF THE TART is a gift. I discovered this book in the Washington Post Food section, which seems to be dedicated to folks like me who don't want to restort to scambled eggs, oatmeal, or fast food night after night. How wonderful to discover there are elegant dishes one can fix relatively quickly, and in most cases healthier than the fast food fix.<br />Day-Lewis is apparently well established in England as a food expert and has written articles for Conde-Nast and House and Garden. If you missed her in these other forms, this is a good place to start. Some of her tarts are meals, such as the 'Porcini Mushroom and Red Onion' tart or the 'Scallop, Artichoke, and Smoked Bacon' tart. Other tarts are for dessert, such as 'A Tatin of Apricots Stuffed with Almond Paste' or 'Apple Crumble Tart.' Not all tarts come in the same wrapper. While some tarts have a traditional flaky crust, others have a crust of polenta such as the 'Corn and Scallion Tart' or 'George Morley's Leek Tart' which has a cheese pastry crust. Some of the recipes Day-Lewis includes are her own, such as the 'Spinach and Anchovy' tart or the 'Asparagus' tart, and others are from friends.<br />There are plenty of plain tarts, and tarts with too much cholesterol, but there is a tart for everyone. According to the Washington Post, Ms Day-Lewis is the sister of Daniel. Such a talented family.	2001-09-12

I love short stories and first discovered Divakaruni by reading a short story she wrote for a magazine. What struck me then and what strikes me now having read THE UNKNOWN ERRORS OF OUR LIVES is the similarity of the experiences of the heroines in her nine tales and my own experiences or those of &quot;plain old American&quot; female friends and relatives of mine. I believe Divakaruni writes tales almost any woman can understand and identify with...in the same way we understand our friend's confidences, stories like the &quot;Little House&quot; series American girls read as children, family myths, etc.<br />Most of us grew up with the idea we were moving toward some destiny. Often this was the way our own life would reveal itself over time. An aspect of the progress of our life might be a pilgrimage to a &quot;holy&quot; site. In her story &quot;The Lives of Stangers&quot; Divakaruni relates the experiences of two women who make such a journey to a sacred place in Kashmir. In her tale &quot;The Blooming Season for Cacti&quot; she tells of both the geographic movement and the internal shift of a heroine who discovers her unknown self.<br />Many of us have experienced attempts by relatives to &quot;arrange marriages&quot; whether we know it or not by introducing us to someone &quot;nice&quot;. And many of us have had the reaction of the young woman in &quot;The Unknown Errors of Our Lives&quot; who discovers the unknown errors are the ones you commit unknowingly over and over. Many women opt to make their own choices like one of the characters in &quot;The Names of the Stars in Bengali.&quot; I personally have two female Indian friends who married blonde, blue-eyed &quot;American&quot; guys.<br />Many Americans have made a journey to a far city away from relatives and toward the future (the most mobile society on earth). It does not matter if you live on the East Coast of the U.S. and your mother is on the West Coast or she is in some other part of the world your life will be different and you will grow apart (i.e. lose that childhood connection).<br />Many folks of Indian descent migrated to the United States from India as well as places other than India. One reason Americans may identify with Divakarumi's stories is because we are a nation of immigrants, but folks of Indian descent folks blend relatively seamlessly into U.S. culture (at least in Washington DC, New York, the West Coast, and other areas) because many of them speak English from birth, hold middle class values, and migrate from what used to be British East Africa, England, Canada, Fiji, and the West Indies. The Indian diaspora took place long ago and since the U.S. is a former British colony, folks from other British colonies have much in common with us...including our language.<br />Which leads me to Divakaruni's writing. In addition to telling tales I can identify with, creating characters I care about, and describing settings with wonderful detail, Divakaruni has a way with English. Her writing is beautiful, filled with imagery, lyrical and very much like the tales told by that great Canadian author Alice Munroe (another former colony). If you like Alice Munro's short stories, you'll love Divakaruni's tales.e will be different and you will grow apart (i.e. lose that childhood connection).<br />Many folks of Indian descent migrated to the United States from India as well as places other than India.

THE MALCONTENTA by Barry Maitland will keep the reader thoroughly entertained on a long flight or wait at the doctor's office. The book has several strenghths and a few minor weaknesses.<br />First, Maitland creates relatively strong settings. Maitland teaches university level architecture and in THE MALCONTENTA he has inserted interesting material about 18th Century architecture -- the Italian influence on the English country house (Palladio)-- which will appeal to anyone familiar with the Italinate influence on the Neoclassical Age in England. And, despite what the reviewer says, the house in this story is based on an Italian design (Palladio) -- the original in Vicenza and known as The Malcontenta.<br />Second, Maitland does a pretty convincing job of developing his characters, though some are more adequately drawn than others. One character in THE MALCONTENTA, a woman with a serious illness is quite real and her discussions with Brock are so authentic I felt as if I was overhearing a conversation.<br />Maitland won't keep you in suspense for long. He has too many characters and they fall all over each other and drag down the action (Kathy's room mates and co-workers should be thinned out). The plot of THE MALCONTENTA is fairly believable although there are some nonplausible moments. I just don't think good cops travel without cell phones. However, Maitland is far better at avoiding mad plot twists than many of his contemporaries who boggle the mind at times.<br />All in all, this is a good and entertaining book, and I like it well enough to read other books by Maitland.	2001-09-05

ANATOMY OF A ROSE: EXPLORING THE SECRET LIFE OF FLOWERS is slightly mistitled. The book has a few things to say about roses--a section on the scent of roses and a section about the commercial interest in concocting a blue rose. The subtitle best describes the contents of Russell's book--the secret life of flowers.<br />I'm a plant/gardening/nature enthusiast who is fairly well read but I learned a new things from Russell's book. For example, I did not know that the great taxonimist/plant classifier Linnaeus (born in 1707) acquired his love of and interest in plants from his relatives. Seems his great-grandmother was burned as a witch because she knew too much about plants. Linnaeus fared better probably partly owing to his ability to read and write about plants in Latin.<br />Russell has done a very good job of reviewing, selecting, organizing and distilling the current thinking on flowers --including the projected 7th Extinction which has already begun and will continue over the next 100 years. Like Rachel Carson's SILENT SPRING, this little book warns the reader.<br />Russell says only one percent of the known flowers have been fully studied, and many will become extinct before we understand them. Flowers hold the key to saving lives, promoting good health, and ensuring the survival of the planet as we know it. Russell tells of the discovery of a plant extract that can fight EBOLI; the discovery of Taxol in the fungus of trees cut down for the Taxol in their bark (the implication is that a really smart person would harvest the Taxol, not kill the goose that lays the golden egg!!); and the uses of many of other plants for medicinal purposes. Pharmaceutical companies are beginning to take an interest in preserving the wilderness--or at least preserving it for their uses.<br />The jury is still out on the affect of gentically engineered plants on other life forms. Gentically engineered corn has been empirically linked to the demise of Monarch Butterfly and too date it is not &quot;off the hook&quot; as another reviewer suggests, however, the &quot;not knowing&quot; is clearly an issue.<br />We have much to learn from the flowering plants. I recommend this book to any one who wants to become familiar with the current outlook for plants as well as the history of plants and their role in evolution. You don't need to be a botonist to understand Russell's clearly written and elegantly told story of the flowers and their connection to our own lives.it is not &quot;off the hook&quot; as another reviewer suggests, however, the &quot;not knowing&quot; is clearly an issue.<br />We have much to learn from the flowering plants.

PUBLISH AND PERISH is a good read although I did not find it as chilling as some mysteries, including those by P.D. James and Patricia Cornwall. This book is scary in places and if you suffer from phobias (heights and closed in spaces) or find cruelty to animals offputting you might avoid it. Although the book contains three separate stories, they are interconnected and deconstructed so that bits of stories #1 and #2 are partly told in #3. Story #3 is by far the best, so don't put the book down until you read &quot;Casting the Runes.&quot; Some academics may think excessive competition, back-stabbing, and treachery are found only in their world. As former member of both the corporate and political worlds (I worked for the U.S. Congress), and one who spent years in graduate school, I'd take academe any day. What makes offensive behaviour more noxious in an academic setting is that one believes educated people are more civilized and that they will behave better. They are not and they do not. One of my more interesting discoveries on leaving the academic world and learning to write text &quot;ordinary&quot; folks could read (elected officials and corporate executives) was that spilit infinitives don't really matter. The infinitive in Latin and the Romance languages cannot be split, although I labored for ages with the belief that the construction of sentences in English must follow Latin rules of grammar. I love Latin and studied it for many years, but one day I realized English is a living language and there are many ways to speak and write English. Hynes makes fun of the academic world and with good cause. Sadly, parts of it are in grave danger of becoming totally irrelevant. Not science and math, but the what we used to call the Liberal Arts. What is truth? My advisor said when you realize that truth is the great unknown you are becoming educated. Hynes stretches the truth with his tales of horror, or does he? As for me, I'm learning to read the runes.	2001-08-29

Did you ever try to decide whether the little wren on the back patio was a Winter Wren, a Carolina Wren, Bewick's Wren, or a House Wren? With this book you can add a few more wrens to your list. You'll also find plenty of Sparrows, Warblers, and members of other bird families. BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA: EASTERN BIRDS contains a comprehensive listing of the birds who spend at least part of their year living east of the Mississippi as well as plenty of western birds of interest--like the House Finch who migrated east. This book is large-more than 700 pages-so it's heavy, but it has a plasicized cover so you can haul it in your backpack if you're strong. Since the Smithsonian developed it, the book is literally jam-packed with information, including: a description with a color photo; call notes; habitat; nesting habits; relative size (the bird is silhouetted against the book); bird look-alikes; and plenty of other useful stuff. Each bird receives a full page of coverage. My only complaint, and it's barely worth mentioning is that the maps appearing with each bird entry are a bit small. In some cases a bird's domain is barely visiable, but partly that's owing to the demise of the domain. You not only will discover where the little guys summer, winter, and breed, you'll discover which birds are threatened with extinction owing to the human caused destruction of their habitats. The book contains a listing of now-extinct birds, each of them profiled as the still living birds have been. The loss of the Carolina Parakeet is the saddest tale. Carolina Parakeets were once prolific. They ranged over most of the Eastern United States. They were so loyal to their flock mates the live birds would fly to the side of the dead and dying birds. As they hovered around their dying mates hunters killed them. (John Muir pointed out ages ago that animals feel sorrow, and all of us who are close to animals know this.) The Carolina Parakeet was destroyed for it's feathers. The Veery is facing a similar fate. Not only is it's habitat being destroyed, the lichen it depends on is disappearing from the trees in the Eastern part of the country and around the Great Lakes owing to air pollution. (Think twice about those polluting smoke stacks and SUVs!!) Talk about a canary in the mine!! Bird-watching is a pleasurable past time I have shared with grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles, and now share with my children and grandchildren. If we all don't get more serious about preserving the places birds live and breed there won't be any birds to watch. The Smithsonian is dedicated to preserving our heritage. It's Guide will raise your consciousness and help you identify many more birds than you ever thought possible.similar fate.

Bird-watching is a pleasurable past time I have shared with grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles, and now share with my children and grandchildren. If we all don't get more serious about preserving the places birds live and breed there won't be any birds to watch. The Smithsonian is dedicated to preserving our heritage. It's Guide will raise your consciousness and help you identify many more birds than you ever thought possible.	2001-08-28

Recently, I was given photographs of my great-grandmother Priscilla and her mother Julia. I know some things about them, for example Priscilla was a co-founder of the garden club in Green Bay WI. I have a photocopy of a newspaper clipping taken the day she celebrated 40 years with the club circa 1910. But I want to know more about her daily life. I was pleased to discover Jeanne Peterson's little book on Victorian gentlewomen because I think it describes women like my great-grandmother --except that my grandmother was American and Peterson's Victorian women are British. In the Preface of her book on Victorian Gentlewomen, Jeanne Peterson says the image many of us have of the Victorian gentlewoman is flawed. She says you will find her everywhere- playing tennis, on horseback, caring for her husband and children, and traveling in the Mexican mountains. She says she came to the study of Victorian gentlewoman because she wishes to put to rest the &quot;persistent stereotypes of the Victorian lady that survive, despite all the recent research and writing about women.&quot; Peterson says the stereotypes of the Victorian woman persist for three reasons: 1) &quot;We see what we want to see. And it has been a comfort to think of the Victorian era as a golden age when, at least for the upper-middle class, the ideal nuclear family really existed..&quot; 2) The sources we refer to when reading about the Victorian age including John Stuart Mill's 'Essay on the Subjection of Women' and Virginia Woolfe's 'Room of One's Own' which describe the &quot;plight&quot; of the woman in the 19th Century. 3) Students of this period have a tendancy to see the Victorian middle class as a coherent whole when in fact it was comprised of an upper-middle and a lower-middle that lived very different lives. Peterson investigates the lives of several dozen women, all from the upper-middle class. She discovers these women were writers, teachers, physicians, and in the case of a few, scientists. She describes this group as the &quot;achieving class&quot; because it consisted of women like Harriet Martineau, Florence Nightengale, and George Eliot. One of the more interesting members of Peterson's group is the famous entomologist Eleanor Ormerod, who began life as the daughter of a Gloucestershire landed gentleman. Her discovery of an unusual locust led her to the life of a scientist. Ormerod wrote phamphlets and books, taught and lectured, and became one of Britain's leading agricultural entomologists. Although I believe Peterson may have intended to demonstrate something different, the message I received from her book was that some women were able to overcome almost unsurmountable odds and achieve great things in spite of the restrictions of the Victorian era. In every case Peterson examines, wealth, family position, and the assistance of a loving male relative were all critical factors in opening doors otherwise closed. And, for some women, the doors remained closed. Henry and William James' sister Alice, and Virginia Woolfe's mother, did not fare quite so well.scribes this group as the &quot;achieving class&quot; because it consisted of women like Harriet Martineau, Florence Nightengale, and George Eliot.

I recently purchased three new books on birds, and I did not buy them from Amazon and I could have saved a bundle, but I am an impulsive book buyer... One of my new books, WHERE THE BIRDS ARE, was published by the National Wildlife Federation--you know Ranger Rick and the other backyard buddies--and I do live near the NWF headquarters, and they do have a gift shop.... WHERE THE BIRDS ARE lists the 100 best locations for watching birds in North America outside your own backyard. Amazingly or otherwise, the NWF lists places to watch birds in every state, as it turns out two of them here in Virginia. One of these places is Great Falls Virginia, just up the street. Guess I'll look more closely next time we visit. Each section of the book contains a description of the site including a little map, visiting hours, and other entrance information as well as the types of habitat to be found at the site and the kinds of bird life. At Great Falls Virginia, we can observe Robins and White Throated Sparrows as well as vistors on the Eastern flyway such as the Northern Parula. In fact the book says 34 types of warblers have been spotted in Great Falls. Since the NWF book does not show any other species than the three I've named, you may want to invest in a book with a more comprehensive listing of birds which brings me to one of my other purchases -- BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA from the Smithsonian. I've been a Petersen devotee for years, and love the Petersen Field Guide, but the Smithsonian book is quite good too. It contains photos and other information which will help you identify the birds you sight after you follow the NWF guide and locate your bird site. For the curious, the third book I bought is THE AUDUBON BACKYARD BIRDWATCHER and yes, I have spotted the Robin and White Throated Sparrow in my own back yard as well as a few of those confusing fall warblers Peterson lists. Still, our yard abuts National Park land which forms a contiguous chain with the Great Falls nature preserve. So, it's not surprising we should be able to spot some of the same birds.ve.

I recently purchased THE AUDUBON BACKYARD BIRDWATCHER, as well as WHERE THE BIRDS ARE published by the National Wildlife Federation and BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA from the Smithsonian. All three books have something to recommend them, and if you are an avid bird watcher or want to become one you will want all three. The Audubon book will have the greatest appeal to the backyard bird watcher who has neither the time nor inclination to travel to the wonderful sites listed in the NWF publication. The Audubon book is not exhaustive or even nearly so. For a more complete listing of birds, turn to another Audubon publication or the Smithsonian publication I mentioned above. Audubon offers complete listings of birds by geographic regions in other publications. You'll find only birds adapted to areas inhabited by humans in the AUDUBON BACKYARD BIRDWATCHER -- familiar friends like Robins and Finches, Pine Siskins and Chickadees. Each bird entry contains a photograph of the bird under discussion, sometimes in flight, sometimes posing and sometimes feeding itself or it's young. This book is wonderful for kids and I am using it to teach my grandchildren about birds just as my grandparents taught me!! The book contains sections on bathing, bird calls (including call notes and mimicry), and baby raising, and all are illustrated with many wonderful photos including some amazing shots of babies hatching, babies being fed, and babies launching into independence. Sections on bird pests, bird deaths, and bird rescues explain foiling predators, warning birds about glass windows, and banding and tracking birds. The child exposed to this book will learn someting about birds and life. Probably one of the most informative sections for the new birder or even old birders like me includes suggestions about what to grow in your own backyard to attract the birds. It's not enough to put out seed in a birdfeeder if you want diversity, though the book covers what to use in bird feeders. If you want to see anything other than seed eaters however, you'll have to provide other types of foods including bugs and berries. Usually where you grow berries, you'll have bugs. The book contians sections on hedging, vegetation variety, leaf litter (for cover, food, and nest-building), dust for baths, and water requirements. While the Audubon book isn't a gardening book per se, you'll find more information about building a bird friendly garden in this book than in most gardening books. I recommend the Audubon book as a teaching and instuction tool for the new birders and old birders alike. Oh--my favorite baby picture? -- the short-eared owls. If you don't think owls can come to your back yard guess again. I've had them in my backyard and I live 10 minutes from the White House. I won't tell you want owls eat. You just go right on thinking it's mice.see anything other than seed eaters however, you'll have to provide other types of foods including bugs and berries.

TAINTED SOULS AND PAINTED FACES by Amanda Anderson is a relatively complex book -- probably best suited for graduate studies, although I read it willingly because I continue to have an interest in the subject. Characterized by it's publisher as fitting the category \\"Literature/Women's Studies\\" the book could also be used in history or sociology classes. If you don't know Marx as a sociologist, or are unfamiliar with Habermas, you may find some parts of Anderson's book including the afterward difficult. On the other hand, if you relate to the nexus of linguistics and poststructuralism in literature, this book may be your cup of tea. Anderson investigates the Victorian concept of \\"fallenness\\" by reviewing the work of four British authors who were active during the years 1840 to 1860 and who wrote about \\"fallen women\\" -- Charles Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell, Daniel Rossetti, and Elizabeth Barrett Browing. .... Anderson attempts to explain \\"fallenness\\" as a many faceted historical construct, and I believe she succeeds to a great extent.	2001-08-25

Adam Phillips takes the title of his book -- PROMISES, PROMISES -- from the last entry in this collection of essays, where he outlines the underlying theme of his collection. He says, &quot;For me - for all sorts of reasons - there has always been only one category, literature, of which psychoanalysis becomes a part.&quot; He says in reading, one carries out a solitary act, a meditation of sorts. In reading literature -- whatever that is, and the lines have become clouded in recent years -- one engages a person who is not present in the room. On the other hand, psychoanalysis where one engages someone who is in the room is &quot;literature restored to practicality -- the absolute antithesis of art for art's sake...&quot; All these essays deal with some aspect of psychoanalysis and frequently Phillips uses the published word - 'literature' - to illustrate his point. Sometimes, an essay is a &quot;talk&quot; Phillips has given to a group, such as &quot;On Translating a Person&quot; originally presented as the Gwyn Jones Memorial Lecture in Cardiff Wales in 2000. In this essay, Phillips refers to a book by Raymond William entitled 'Materialism and Culture', about Welsh society. Because Phillips is from Wales (and Jewish), he is interested in how Williams &quot;translates&quot; the Welsh culture. Phillips says &quot;What Williams is alerting us to is that what he calls the emergence of 'structures of feelings' depend upon the culture forms available for use. And each of those forms carries with it a history and a class consciousness.&quot; Phillips applies this idea to psychoanalysis where he says the individual has a &quot;consciousness of history, a consciousness of alternatives, a consciousness of aspirations and possibilities: a wish for translation.&quot; He says, &quot;Psychoanalyst don't think of themselves as translating people. The analyst interprets, reconstructs, questions, redescribes, returns the signifier..but he rarely describes what he does as translating the patient's material.&quot; Yet, the analyst is assisting the analysand to interpret his own life, to read his own text, to translate. In the end, who decides if the translation is a good one? Many of the essays are reviews of books-most biographies and a few autobiographies. A few works of non-fiction are included. I particularly enjoyed &quot;Doing Heads&quot; a review of Patrick McGrath's book 'Picador Book of New Gothic' which describes how horror stories moved from the exteral world to the internal world with the arrival of Edgar Allen Poe who dealt with &quot;the terror inside.&quot; All of these essays explore the challenge of knowing the self, establishing an &quot;identity&quot; by reading and absorbing literature and/or by taking a more pragmatic approach and entering analysis. In the first, the writer who is not present facilitates the reader's interpretation and understanding. In the latter, the analyst who is present facilitates the act of reading and interpreting the self. In both situations, the reader is free to choose how and what s/he will interpret, absorb, and apply. Phillips seems to have concluded that while one can spend a lifetime attempting to know the self in the end the authentic self may be unknowable.g the patient's material.&quot; Yet, the analyst is assisting the analysand to interpret his own life, to read his own text, to translate.

When you were a child and fell and hurt yourself, do you recall your first instinct was to press your hand over the hurt and hold it? Or maybe you remember sounds, colors, or smells that comforted you when you were sick. Ted Andrews uses the example of the hand held hurt to demonstate to the reader of THE HEALER'S MANUAL that many of his techniques are instinctual. Unfortunately, as we grow older we may tend to forget these simple truths or stop beliving in them as effective remedies.<br />Andrews divides his book into sections, each dealing with therapies that affect the five senses.  My favorites are smell,  sound, and sight. I've known for a long time certain scents like Lavendar and Eucalyptus are healing, and that certain kinds of music can lower my blood pressure.  I'm also affected by color..yellow can perk me up and blue calms me down.<br />Andrews discusses many techniques I know will work because I've tried them, and others I sense will work that I have not yet tried. I have doubts about some like healing elixers from gems, but I keep an open mind and a positive outlook. Like the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland, I believe in at least six impossible things before breakfast. It's amazing how many of them come true by dinnertime.	2001-08-18

I thought I would be the 50th person to write a &quot;testimonial&quot; for THE GREEN PHARMACY -- ANTI-AGING PRESCRIPTIONS by James Duke, but it turns out no one has written a review to date.  This is a big surprise for me because Dr. Duke's book is wonderful.<br />Dr. Duke (he has a Ph.D.) retired from the USDA where he worked as Chief of the Medicinal Plant Resources Laboratory for years. In retirement (he's age 72), he remains active in ReNuPeru, a medicinl herb garden in the Peruvian Amazon maintained by the Amazon Center for Environmental Education and Research.  In other words, he has credentials in plant pharmaecology recognized by the U.S. Government.<br />Dr. Duke owns a six-acre farmette in Fulton Maryland where he raises medicinal/food plants. I discovered Duke in a book on herbalist gardens entitled, THE HERBALIST'S GARDEN, by Shatoiya and Richard de la Tour.  Both books (Duke and de la Tour) were reviewed by a local garden expert in the Washington Post. The Post article and the de la Tour book contain beautiful photographs of Duke's garden but alas he has included no photographs in his own book (why I gave it 4 stars).<br />I've been growing and using herbs for over forty years (I drank Camomile tea and ate bean and barley soup in the 1960s), and I own a number of books on this subject. Dr. Duke's book on &quot;anti-aging prescriptions&quot; appeals to me because 1) I am older and the book meets my immediate needs, 2) the book is laid out by ailment or &quot;challenge&quot; not by herb. In othr words, I don't have to hunt for salient information.<br />For example, if you're worried about cracking and peeling skin you can turn to Section 22. 'Smooth Skin' and read about the various approaches, techniques, etc. you might use to improve your skin's health. I discovered the flaxseed oil I have been taking for symtoms of menopause is exactly what I need for skin health but I should buy a variant that includes Borage or Evening Primrose oil.<br />Duke has many helpful suggestions including eating what he calls the Paleolithic diet consisting of many servings of vegetables and fruits and fewer servings of meats, cheeses and other dairy items (I'm not eating grubs--nor does he recomend them).  And, yes you've probably read about this diet--it's the official USDA recommended diet--but Duke's value-added information is the list of ingredient he pinpoints for health.  He explains why prunes, plums and other dark fruit are good for you, and why beans other than soy beans make a difference. To begin your older years (50+) in good health, I recommend you read Dr. Duke's book and practice what he preaches.many helpful suggestions including eating what he calls the Paleolithic diet consisting of many servings of vegetables and fruits and fewer servings of meats, cheeses and other dairy items (I'm not eating grubs--nor does he recomend them).

WITCHCRAFT AND MAGIC IN EUROPE -- THE EIGHTEENTH AND THE NINETEENTH CENTURIES is the fifth volume in the 6-part W&amp;E series, and the first I have read, but I will read others. This excellent body of work is long overdue and I am happy to see the complete story finally emerging, although as editors Bengt Ankarloo and Stuart Clark point out this is only the beginning. W&amp;M is a synopsis of current research (through 1998) by the academic community in Europe.<br />Until now the Roman Catholic Church has been viewed as the chief source of persecution of &quot;witches.&quot;  While the RCC was involved with witchcraft (in more ways than one as it turns out) heretofore historical research about witchcraft was biased as it was largely based on RCC records. The studies in W&amp;E go beyond the RCC records and include work undertaken by hundreds of scholars engaged in the difficult task of ferreting out information from less well organized secular and non-RCC sources scattered across Europe.<br />Witchcraft in Europe has been defined in dozens of ways and the authors use the terms witchcraft and magic interchangably since anyone thought to engage in magical practices was viewed as a sorcerer (male) or magician or witch (female). Magicican, Magi, Witch, Sorcerer all mean &quot;wise one&quot;. One has to wonder if the current craze for Harry Potter would be so great if the protagonist was Harriet Potter and she was a witch.<br />The amazing finding of the W&amp;E scholars (who insist they are still compiling the story) is that the Enlightenment did not end witchcraft and nor did the Reformation before it. Magic was alive and well before and after both movements in spite of the extreme efforts of Protestant leaders like Luther, Calvin, and Wesley to root out RCC herersy and magical practices like turning wine into the blood of Christ and removing evil spirits through exorcism (though some Protestants continued to do faith healing), as well as the attempts of Rationalist thinkers Voltaire, Hume, Locke and others to rid thinking of magic. Eventually, the Protestants and the Rationalists found themselves locked in conflict since belief in God was not &quot;rational&quot;.  The focus of the Protestants changed from eradicating magic to limiting magic.<br />In his section entitled 'Witchcraft and Magic in Enlightenment, Romatic and Liberal Thought' Roy Porter says &quot;...at the grassroots 'superstitions' did not dissolve like mist in the sunshine but proved highly tenacious -- driving reformers to dispair! And the educated themselves continued to uphold a mixed bag of beliefs.&quot;  For example, while Whigs of 18th Century England tried mightly to bring the Neoclassical movement to life in all parts of England via architecture, art, clothing, and literature, but cheap thrillers like the &quot;Castle of Otranto&quot; held the people in thrall--not Alexander Pope's Essay on Man. Jane Austin, whose own father was a village vicar, made fun of the &quot;Gothic&quot; thrillers in her book 'Northanger Abbey' but even this popular author could not dissuade popular opinion.<br />Later in the Eighteenth Century, when the Romantic Movement was in full flower, Europe and America produced Shelley's 'Frankenstein'; Stoker's Dracula; and Irving's 'Sleepy Hollow'; Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher'; Sir Walter Scott's 'Ivanhoe'; (Avonlea, the Lady of the Lake, Merlin and Arthur, the Tales of Robin Hood). The Romantic movement was fueled by love of the non-rational in a &quot;rationalized&quot; and industrialized age.<br />From village priests who practiced sorcery to Puritan Protestant ministers who ran them out of town, from Rationalists who preached efficency to Romantics who painted clouds, wrote poetry about daffodils or tigers in the night, or set down fairy tales, from women and men stoned as magicians, witches, or fairy-changlings to the men who appropriated female magic and called it medicine W&amp;E covers it all. This is a wonderful book about an incredible era. In the end, magic IS.ook about an incredible era. In the end, magic IS.	2001-08-16

GARDEN STRUCTURES by Linda Smith is marginally useful for the experienced upscale or midscale gardener (many of these projects are costly) or the reader who enjoys pretty pictures. If you are building a theme garden (i.e. Formal Italian, Dutch Colonial, Japanese Zen, Medieval Cloister) this book can prove disconcerting. If you can tell the difference between a Victorian gazebo and an Italian bench you may not find the display offputting.<br />Smith's book appears to be a photo collection of garden elements from all over the country and the result is a hotch-potch of  structures reflecting a wide array of styles, periods, and eras. She has mixed Adams, Hepplewhite, Dutch colonial, Zen, 50's Moderne, and Art Deco, Italian, and plantation-style in categories by type of structure.<br />GARDEN STRUCTURES contains categories covering fences, gates, trellises, arbors, edgings and other &quot;bones&quot; of the garden. The  section on gates shows a wide assortment of every kind of gate--wrought iron, post, picket, etc. The section on fences shows stockades, picket, wattle, split rail, etc. The section on paths shows pebbles, stones, bricks, bricks and cement, terracotta, grass, etc. (Paths probably are the least problematic, but one wonders how well colonial-style Italian stringcourse would look on a Zen garden path.)<br />If you're building a REALLY eclectic garden this detailed inventory might prove useful. Or, if you know how to integrate the various items from the various sections because you recognize their age/period/style it will work.  You may want to find another book that shows entact gardens--plants, fences, gates, trellises, arbors, and other elements together. From the 'whole-some' examples you can derive a notion of what constitutes an integrated picture.<br />GARDEN STRUCTURES provides the reader with hundreds of piece-parts but does not shed much light on how to put it them together. Still, the experienced gardener may find some provocative ideas here.	2001-08-06

Terence Conran's GARDEN DIY (do it yourself) contains 75 doable projects from a child's play house to various other wood, stone, brick, terracotta, and cement projects for your outside garden rooms.  Conran shows several examples for each garden structure (pergolas, trellises, arbors, fences, patios, paths, ponds, and plant containers) with complete instructions for at least one example in each set.<br />For example, the section showing a variety of seating arrangements, includes a complete set of instructions for making a very pretty yellow painted garden bench with slatted 1&quot;x1&quot; rails. One needs to review the instructions before determining whether the materials and/or tools are on hand or available, but Conran tells the reader exactly what s/he will need for each illustrated project.<br />I borrowed the book from the library and decided not to purchase it because the items Conran illustrates do not meet my particular needs. Currently, I am looking for instructions for a garden screen to restrict my view of the next-door neighbor's yard. While Conran includes a few items that would fit the definition of a garden screen his examples do not match what I have in mind. I needed a screen in another part of the yard where I was less worried about blocking sunlight (against a fence for example) his illustrations would prove more helpful.<br />The best sections of the book from my perspective include his great illustrations for hen-houses/bird houses. These fowl shelters are so beautiful I would build one but I live in an area that does not allow chickens--even ornate feathered pet chickens. His examples of garden houses are also beautiful but I don't need a garden house because I already have one.<br />If you're just beginning to create structures for your outdoor rooms and think you may want to &quot;do it yourself&quot; you'll find plenty of ideas in this book.	2001-08-05

SUMMER OF A DORMOUSE takes it's title from Byron who said when one subtracts sleeping, eating and other personal maintenance one has about as much time to be productive as the summer of a dormouse. Of course Lord Byron himself was quite productive until he was bled dry by leeches says John Mortimer whose wife gave him a ring with an engraved dormouse on his last birthday.<br />DORMOUSE is Mortimer's third installment in his autobiography (the official one, Rumpole is unofficial). In his earlier entries (CLINGING TO THE WRECKAGE, MURDERERS AND OTHER FRIENDS) he covered his childhood, life with wife number one (Penny) and wife number two (Penelope) as well as his writing and legal career through age 65 or so. In DORMOUSE, Mortimer continues the tale covering recent events in his seventies (with flashbacks).<br />Mortimer has not slowed down very much though he is blind in one eye and forced to use wheeled conveyences through air port terminals (sometimes at the risk of life and limb) as he whizzes around the globe on various book-signing tours and other business trips. For instance, during the 1990s he was busy writing the screen play for the film 'Tea with Mussolini' -- an autobiographical account of Franco Zefirelli's boyhood in wartime Italy starring Dames of the British Empire Judy Dench and Maggie Smith as well as Lady Joan Plowright. As a result of his involvement, he has been privy to the behind the scenes antics of the old gals. Seems these pillars of the theatre were caught nude in Franco Zefirelli's swimming pool one afternoon. (I knew Dench couldn't possibly be as dull as her biographer suggested!!)<br />Mortimer has literary flashbacks, amazing tales to convey, and engages in a bit of reflection as he faces &quot;Timor mortis&quot; which he says becomes rather acute after age 75. During the course of his book, several old friends and his first wife Penelope exit the stage. From time to time he feels like throwing in the towel himself but something always seems to come along set him going again.

I like Alison Weir's books because she is able to extract the pertinent facts from the most complex of sources and present a great deal of information in an immensely readable book. THE CHILDREN OF HENRY THE VIII is no exception. Although she is a &quot;popular&quot; writer, Weir does not shun primary materials. Her bibliography is very impressive and she seems to have &quot;done her homework&quot;.<br />CHILDREN covers the lives of Henry's three children by Katherine of Aragon, Anne Boylyn, and Jane Seymour. I find it amazing that one of England's greatest monarchs, Elizabeth I, was the daughter of a woman who reigned for a mere 1,000 days. Known as the &quot;French whore&quot; by the Catholics who hated her, she was a lady in waiting to Katherine of Aragon the mother of Mary.<br />According to Weir, the young Mary was most solicitous for the life and welfare of her young sister Elizabeth after Anne Boylyn was beheaded. Had it not been for Mary's care, perhaps there would have been no Elizabeth I. Both of young princesses were at risk from various parties after Anne died. Mary, a bit older than Elizabeth was aware their lives were at risk and she did what she could to protect her self and her sister from whom she was later cruelly separated. Sadly, as they grew older and were kept apart by various scheming interest groups, Mary and Elizabeth grew more estranged and distrustful of each other until finally there was a parting which nearly cost Elizabeth her life.<br />Weir tells Mary's tale from the standpoint of a sympathetic viewer. After all, Mary had been raised to expect her place would be with her parents and that someday she would be queen if she had no brothers. Henry was married to Katherine for 20 years, and she bore him many children. Alas, only Mary survived.<br />The English could accept a woman on the throne, but most  preferred a man. Hence, Henry VIII continued to father dozens of children with a succession of wives until at last a son lived. Edward was born to wife number three, Jane Seymour, and although he survided infancy Edward was frail and easily became sick in an era filled with plague and other misasmas.<br />Edward was crowned king however he died young.  Although he was to be followed by his sister Mary who was next in succession for the throne of England, Edward's ministers plotted and placed Lady Jane Grey on the throne. Jane was a cousin to Edward and a direct descendent of Henry VII.  Jane was Protestant, the main reason certain parties supported her. Jane was destined to be overthrown by Mary's forces nine days after she seized the throne. When Mary eventually claimed her throne she was not above buring a few Protestants including the ill-fated Jane who had plotted against her.<br />Most of us grew up reading history books written by Protestant historians who did not tell Mary's story objectively. In THE CHILDREN OF HENRY VIII, Alison Weir has redressed this wrong. Mary was indeed a queen of vengence, but she lived in times that tried women's souls.rd was born to wife number three, Jane Seymour, and although he survided infancy Edward was frail and easily became sick in an era filled with plague and other misasmas. <br />Edward was crowned king however he died young.

If we women can learn anything from Anne Boylyn it is this, don't ever tell your husband that you know some interesting ways to have sex.  Poor Anne Boylyn.  She waited many years to marry Henry and then lasted a mere 1,000 days on the throne. Before she left, she managed to bear Henry a few children including a two sons who died in infancy.  Elizabeth probably survived because she was Anne's first child. Weir suggests that Anne was troubled by a particular fertility problem that afflicts some women--a negative blood factor. This factor may have been the cause of the spontaneous abortion of one baby and the death shortly after birth of another.<br />Detail of this sort sets Weir apart from other historians. She tells the tale of Henry and his six wives from the women's standpoint. Some historians could care less about the trials of these women as they dealt with infertility and infecundity yet this issue was a central factor affecting Henry's behavior. For goodness sake, a kingdom was thrown into civil war because a series of women could not conceive and carry to term a male child. Weir thinks it's important to delve into the medical angles as well as all the other personal angles affecting these relationships.<br />WIVES follows the trials and tribulations of the six women who became Mrs. Henry. Most of us are familiar with the women who bore Henry heirs: Katherine, Anne, and Jane Seymour--but what of the other three. Henry's fouth wife was the ill-fated Catherine Howard (Anne Boylyn's first cousin--what was it about these femme fatales??) who had her head removed after she was discovered with another man. Next came a continental wife Anne of Cleves who is reputed to have had a foul body odor (she did not like to bathe). Last came queen Katherine Parr, who became a real mother to Mary, Elizabeth, and Edward and survived Henry.  Anne later married a man she loved and died in childbirth which leads one to speculate that perhaps King Henry became impotent at the end of his reign. But of course, it is never the king's fault if his wife cannot conceive.of his reign. But of course, it is never the king's fault if his wife cannot conceive.	2001-08-04

DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS by PD James is a fine book. This is not her best novel, but it is a good mystery, and proves once more that on her worst day she's still the best mystery writer alive, at least of the genre I like--the English murder mystery. James has a wonderful store of knowledge and she employs it in her stories. She can delve back into her own past and uncover anectdotal information younger writers have to research. When she spins a yarn it's her story, not something she cobbled together from news paper headlines and other people's books. She doesn't depend on shocking violence though she can be shocking enough. In addition, James is English, and her novels set in England ring with verismilitude. Sadly, she is beginning to wind down, and the liklihood of anyone ever writing mysteries of equal worth are almost nil.<br />James lived through most of the 20th Century (she was 80 years old in 2000) and she witnessed incredible changes to institutions that stand for civilized life. In DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS she tackles the demise of the Anglican church. To survive the Church has sold vicarages and church buildings (now converted into condos!!) and many of the remaining buildings are in physical decline. The dismemberment of the old way of life is the backdrop of several murders in DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS.<br />As usual, James has written a complex book that borders on the literary. I asked myself why this isn't literature as I read it, and I think it isn't because to a certain extent like all mystery writers James follows a relatively predictable pattern when it comes to her plot. Agatha Christie's plots were so predictable, I was able to figure out on page three who the murderer was. With James it takes longer, but when the killer is uncovered it is predictable. On the other hand, the character development, and her development of place, her imagery, and other aspects of writing are as literary as anything written by the academic class. DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS is a real treat to read and I envy those of you who have not yet read it.treat to read and I envy those of you who have not yet read it.	2001-07-30

When I was a child and the milk soured, my ever-frugal mother would set it aside in a bowl and allow it to continue it's transformation into something wild and strange. When the curds and the whey separated, she would pour the contents into a cheese cloth stretched across a strainer and then gather and lift the cloth and squeeze the exess fluid from the curds. We ate the cheese as is...a form of &quot;cottage&quot; cheese I suppose. I was reminded of this when I read FRENCH CHEESES from Eyewitness Handbooks which contains a short history of cheese-making in the front section of the book.<br />I like this book, and since I am not a cheese expert, I cannot say whether it will make one an expert or not, but it has enlightened me a bit as I continue to experiment with the various kinds of cheeses available in the gourmet section of the grocery stores and the delicatesson in our neighborhood.<br />I have eaten various cheeses in Paris and other parts of Europe, and thought them better than anything I can buy in the States though I have eaten &quot;fancy&quot; cheeses in some upscale restaurants. I realize the French and others use unpasturized or raw milk in many of their cheeses and the U.S. frowns on the use of untreated milk so perhaps this is a factor. CHEESES identifies cooked versus raw versions.<br />However, many of the cheeses in this book are not found in U.S. stores because a limited supply exists and/or the product is consumed or sold locally. Generally these are artisanal cheeses (made by hand). CHEESES includes a map showing the farm areas of France and each cheese entry pinpoints the geographic location of the product. You can match the map with the cheese of interest to you and perhaps search for it on your next excursion to the French countryside. In the meantime, the list of producers in the appendix may prove helpful.	2001-07-28

I was never very adept with the potting wheel where my projects too often became lost in space, but I used to make very nice ceramics. In the process of dabbling with molds, slip and glaze I wondered about other aspects of the craft and over the years I have read and studied the subject informally. This wonderful book is a valuable resource whether you are starting out and want to experiment with different clay projects or want to refresh your memory.<br />Zakin first explains the building blocks--ceramics-making materials (different combinations lead to different outcomes). He discusses types of clays, feldspars, frits, silica, and other modifying compounds. Ever notice when you hold a cup made from Kaolin (frequently called porcelain) filled with a hot fluid you don't burn your hand whereas the cute cup you bought at the local craft show made from a more porous clay does? Zakin provides a great deal of information about the attributes of clay including plasticity, durability, color, maturity absorption, texture, resistance to warping, and intended use.  If you're making a mug, a quiche pan, or a vase (or buying one), you may want to consider these aspects.<br />Zakin provides the reader with much information about ceramic color, glazes, and mold-making (plenty of tips for success). I was fascinated with the sections discussing glaze making and testing, and kiln loading and firing including some nice photos of the raku process. Section 16 includes a succinct history of ceramics that covers various types generated over the ages (nicely illustrated and clearly written).<br />The appendices of the book continue the in-depth exploration of the process of ceramics making including ways to analyze your results.  This is an informative and well illustrated book containing many examples of ceramics made by the author and other artists working in his field.	2001-07-28

When the 20th Century began, proto-Cubists like Cezanne and the last remnants of the Impressionist movement like Monet dominated European art. No one could foresee the rise of Surrealism. Surrealism was a reaction to it's times that exploded in France in the years following WWI and later migrated to the United States during WWII. In SUREALISM IN EXILE, Martica Sawin says surrealism was inspired by many events. Certainly the surreal literary movement led by writers such as Baudelaire affected the visual arts.  Similarly, the writing of anthropologists and sociologists beginning to make &quot;scientific&quot; contact with traditional societies also played a role.<br />However, Sawin suggests it was the personal experiences of artists like Max Ernst who had served at the front with the German army in WWI and French artists like Paul Eluard who faced him on the battlefield who felt the need to explore surrealism --&quot;Rational&quot; realism was too narrow. Later on, others joined the movement. Onslow Ford, whose physician father had witnessed the slaughter at Gallipoli as an English medical officer and returned home bitter, became a primary player after watching his father slip into depression and madness.<br />Ford was to say at a later date in New York that artists needed to &quot;tear down the veils one by one that hide the reality of our own incomprehensible universe.&quot; He and the other surrealists felt the rationalist view was too restrictive.  The surrealist artist could tap into the collective unconscious described by Jung (whose book on that subject was published in 1939) and bring to light a broader view of reality. Ford said artists could escape the cubist-driven semi-abstact dead end they found themselves in by opening their third eye--the Cyclopian eye, or the mind's eye, or the inner eye, and tap into their unconscious.<br />Sawin's book is a history of Surrealism, a movement that borrowed and incorporated ideas from the Navaho sand painters, the Tsimshian Indians (totem poles), German fairy tales, Celtic myths, Tarot cards, and menhirs--dolmans in Brittany. From these inspirational sources the Surrealists created paintings such as &quot;Rotary Disks&quot; --an optical illusion comprised of revolving concentric circles; &quot;Star, Flower, Personage, Stone' --depicting alchemical transformation; and other physical transformations of space that exploded the confines of the convential 3-D world humans see owing to their limited view of reality. Surrealist art attempted to depict time and change seen by a third eye.<br />SURREALISM IN EXILE is filled with photographs (black and white) of the lives and works of the Surrealists, beginning with the early works in France and ending with the later works from the New York school in the late forties.  If you are interested in exploring the influences that affected the work of Jackson Pollock, Piet Mondrian, Kandinski and other modern artists this book is invaluable.

DAILY LIFE IN HOLLAND IN THE YEAR 1566 is a graphically and beautifully illustrated book by Rien Poortvliet--a gifted Dutch artist with a talent for visualizing past times and bringing them to life. Many of his illustrations contain disturbing content--people hanged and still dangling from the gallows, miscreants tortured and locked in cages, children and adults deathly ill and/or starving. In 1566, the Dutch were struggling with the Spanish for control of the Netherlands and the aftermath of war is not pretty.<br />However, many of Poorvliet's pictures also depict everyday scenes concerning the more pleasant side of life. The viewer is shown ships at sea; horses carrying soldiers and pulling plows; all kinds of housing--floorplans to facades to fully formed buildings; clothing of the various classes including the elaborate headgear of wealthy, deftly wrapped scarves, and helmets; household implements such as lanterns, pails, cooking pots, and candle holders; farming tools; vegetables and meats; and plenty of rural scenery comparable to the works of Ruysdael.<br />Poorvliet's DAILY LIFE IN HOLLAND is based on information he collected from court records and other sources and tells the story of several members of a family over the course of one year. Poortvliet's earlier illustrative tale, IN MY GRANDFATHER'S HOUSE vividly depicted life in Zeeland over several centuries. I actually liked IN MY GRANDFATHER'S HOUSE better than LIFE IN HOLLAND because he portrayed history by tracing his own ancestors back through past generations. First he imagined his father's life, then his grandfather's life, then his great-grandfather's life, etc.<br />Poortvliet's books provide a wonderful way to visualize life in past times...	2001-07-24

Once upon a time I stumbled across this book in a book store and could not believe my eyes. This is absolutely one of the most beautiful books I've ever owned and it is totally relevant to my life. I am Dutch descent and some of my ancestors come from Zeeland, and Poortvliet focuses on life in Zeeland over a two hundred year period, so you can imagine how thrilled I was to discover a beautifully illustrated book by a Dutch artist whose ancestors came from a village not far from my own.<br />Poortvliet tells his story with illustrations.  There is little text, and it is mostly captions for his illustrations. He begins his book with his own father's life, and moves back through time telling about his grandfather's life, then his great-grandfather's life, then his great-great grandfather's story in pictures. Only an artist could vividly bring the past to life in this manner.<br />If you are of Dutch descent, you must see this book. At the least check it out of the library, but I think you may want to own it. I am sad to see that it is out of print because next to the geneology chart on your family, this is the best way to get in touch with the lives of your Dutch ancestors.	2001-07-24

Erica Jong has been the Thomas Paine of the Women's Movement, and over the years I have always known I could count on her to inspire me when I felt worn down by the forces of sexism.  Although Jong has been an articulate and effective spokesperson for women's issues, she has frequently ignored important detail and left herself open to criticism. This is a pity because there are those who will throw the baby out with the bathwater.<br />It should surprise no one that the author of THE FEAR OF FLYING would be inspired to write a book on WITCHES--who are reputed to fly and have strong sexual urges. However, these attributes alone do not a book on witches make.<br />Ms Jong's WITCHES has many fine points and some bothersome weaknesses. On the one hand, WITCHES contains some wonderful and fantastical illustrations of witches by Joseph Smith (ironical ain't it??). In fact, WITCHES reminds me of a fairy-tale book for adults. The text type is &quot;big&quot; and she includes many interesting sidebars along with her pictures.<br />On the other hand, Ms. Jong's text is less than accurate. From my reading of academic works by respected historians and anthropologists and of books by wiccans/witches acknowldged to be &quot;experts&quot; by their followers, I think Ms. Jong lacked both a knowledge of witchcraft and a research background. Unfortunately, her shortcomings are apparent. Jong has written a &quot;pop&quot; witch book.<br />Although Jong includes a relatively impressive bibliography, most of her writing seems to be based on her interpretation of three sources: Margot Adler's DRAWING DOWN THE MOON, the MALLEUS MALEFICARUM written by two Inquistors, and the questionable works of Margaret Murray. The rest of the text is an interesting hotch-potch of factoids from a variety of sources.<br />If she mentioned the Inquisition once, she mentioned it a hundred times. Given historical research of the past few years, it is simply not accurate to blame the Roman Catholic church for the &quot;witch-craze&quot; of the 16th and 17th centuries. As Candace Savage points out in her extremely well researched book WITCH, over half of the witches destroyed by Christians during the witch-craze were killed in Protestant Germany. Many more were killed in Scotland, Sweden, and Switzerland--home to northern Protestants.<br />Jong's logic is flawed and her chronology muddled. She leaps from the 17th Century to the 14th Century, from the Scottish king James' fear of sorcerers to Barbara Tuchman's description of social brekdown during the Black Plague. She seems to have an axe to grind against &quot;the church&quot; i.e. the Roman Catholic Church. Well, I am a &quot;fallen-away&quot; Catholic myself and I certainly find many church positions difficult to swallow (although I love Mary), but I believe in historical accuracy as nearly as we can determine it.  Unfortunately, Christians of both persuasions, as well as many nationalities have treated women very badly over the past 1000 years or so. Blaming the Roman Catholic Church for all these atrocities is rather like blaming Germany for all the deaths in the 20th Century -- a major player but there's plenty of blame to go around.for the &quot;witch-craze&quot; of the 16th and 17th centuries.

THE HERBALIST'S GARDEN is subtitled a &quot;guided tour of 10 exceptional herb gardens&quot; and it is just that. I don't think you could get much closer to the real thing unless you made the actual physical trip to each of these gardens. Perhaps the only drawback for me is that so many of them are on the West Coast because seeing them makes me want to SEE them.<br />The photographs by Saxon Holt are some of the best. In each picture, I can clearly distinguish one plant from another--no small feat since to capture one plant clearly often causes others to be distorted. For example in one shot the viewer can raise her eyes from lettuce in the first row to cabbage in the second row to onions in the third row. I guess this is &quot;trick&quot; photography, but it's great. Although the photos are not three dimensional, they remind me of old 3-D viewer I had when I was a kid or the holograms of today where you can hold the picture to your eye and feel as if you are &quot;inside&quot; the frame.<br />The de la Tours have done a fabulous job of compiling, writing, and editing their book. They are down to earth and friendly and the text is newsy and informative. The de la Tours own Dry Creek Farm and Learning Center in Auburn California--the first garden  on the guided tour which features the gardens of several other herbalist/gardeners and writers. Each section shows a ground plan for the featured garden. There are plenty of shots of the gardens including entrances and paths, and unique features found at the various sites.<br />Dry Creek Farm features a children's garden, a medicine-wheel garden, and a moon garden. The medicine-wheel garden is festooned with multi-colored prayer ribbons--hung out by the de la Tour's students at the Spring Equinox--that will be burned at the Winter Solstice. Along the edge of the medicine-wheel garden are plants representing the Zodiac Signs--Lavender for the Gemini, Mint for Virgo, and Lemon Balm for Cancer.<br />The Moon Garden is composed of a Catalpa tree surrounded by a circle shaped garden. The garden surface is composed of white gravel chips and outlined with smooth river stones. Both the full moon and the cresent are delineated. The full moon is white pebbles sans plants, the crescent is set off by Artemesia, the ghostly white plant that bears the &quot;other&quot; name of Diana, queen of the Fairies, Queen of the Witches and Queen of the Moon. A statue of a coyote (Diana's hund?) sits below the mobile moons hanging from the Catalpa tree.<br />There are photos of garden layouts, photos of specific beds, photos of smiling owners/gardeners and plenty of close-ups of the herbs recommended by the 10 herbalists.

The cover of WITCH by Candace Savage depicts a motly assortment of characters terrorizing a frightened youth. The scene is a reproduction of &quot;The Spell&quot; by Goya, who painted it in 1797 at the height of the witch craze. The picture shows a conjurer in a yellow robe bending over a youth in white. A group of old hags in the background (presumeably witches) are dressed in black. Icons in the painting include the traditional witch imagery of owl-light, bat-wing, and mangled bablies.<br />WITCH is an extremely well-written and concise account of the &quot;witch&quot; story in the west. To label the book as a &quot;feminist&quot; tract is misleading, and a not so subtle manner of saying it is second-rate. WITCH provides the lay person with a solidly written and historically researched account. Many longer and more scholarly accounts by male historians tell the same tale in much more detail. WITCH is not propaganda, nor is it biased by a political agenda. The book is written for the layperson who does not wish to wade through the thousands of tomes written on this subject. Savage provides a nice bibliography if you wish to know more. She has sourced and cited her study from beginning to end.

A picture is worth a thousand words.<br />Other societies had/have witches, but the witch in the West is a direct out-growth of an amalgam of beliefs associated with the  Bible. One of the most important points Savage makes is that the &quot;witch craze&quot; did not take place in the Middle Ages as most believe. The persecution of witches by the Roman Catholic Church was incidental. The Church was after heretics--such as the Cathars and Waldensians. Think of it as bringing in Al Capone for tax evasion. Witchcraft was a means to an end. The fact that the accused eschewed orthodoxy was the real issue.<br />Savage says, &quot;The Reformation began as a movement to cleanse the church of &quot;pagan&quot; superstition. Christianity had been corrupted by Satan, the Protestants said, and they found his mark even on the Mass...&quot;  Savage reiterates what many historians point out...the worst persecutions of &quot;witches&quot; took place after the Protestant Reformation, and in predominantly Protestant countries.  One-half of all the people executed for witchcraft died in Protestant Germany. Scotland, Sweden, and Switzerland were dangerous places for old ladies with no friends. The night Shakespeare's play &quot;MacBeth&quot; opened in England, and three witches stirred their cauldron on stage, people were being burned and hung for witchcraft all over Europe.<br />When the average person pictures a witch s/he visualizes a woman with a pale skin wearing a tall hat and flowing black cape--the typical dress of the 16th Century Puritan. In his painting &quot;The Fight Between Carnival versus Lent&quot; painted at the height of the Reformation, Brueghel depicts a &quot;mock&quot; battle in the foreground with colorfully arrayed miscreants ready for sin while the forces of repression dressed in black flood into the background.<br />Savage covers the story of witches into the 19th and 20th centuries, where behaviour once categorized as evil became &quot;sick&quot; or demented. Freud and his friends soon determined that much of the &quot;hysteria&quot; of the witch craze was a form of projection.<br />By the 20th Century, new targets of victimizaton were at hand in the form of Communists and others deemed &quot;evil&quot; by the established forces and folks lost interest in witches. Savage does not explore these other &quot;witch hunts&quot; but rather continues her tale with an overview of modern Wicca.

I think A FRENCH AFFAIR will be best appreciated by those who have seen Paris once or twice. Those who have no familiarity with Paris and it's residents may become lost. If you know the difference between Simone de Beauvoir and Simone Signoret you may find the book entertaining.<br />If I had not known Mary Blume wrote her Paris beat pieces for the International Herald Tribune, I would have thought they were written for The New Yorker magazine.  She wrote tongue-in-cheek stories that begin in the middle and assume the reader already knows a great deal about Paris life. If she pops up in London you don't blink an eyelash because you know it's a day trip to travel from London to Paris, or Paris to anywhere else for that matter since Paris has made itself the travel hub of Europe.<br />I read these articles over lunch--spread over a few months. I carried the book in my book bag and broke it out when I needed a little light reading.  This is a perfect book for travel because if you put it away and don't look at it for a month you won't loose your train of thought.  If you read it straight through it may be as disappointing as reading a week of newspapers.	2001-07-21

Adrian Higgins writes a weekly column for the Washington Post, and I have come to appreciate his warm and entertaining essays  over the past few years. Higgins follows in Henry Mitchell's footsteps (one of the greatest gardening writers ever!!) and therefore has very large gardening shoes to fill. I don't think Higgins has the gardening acumen of his predecessor, nor does he have the wit, and he does seem to spend a great deal of time hobnobing with rich and famous gardeners whereas Henry was more down to earth--most of his columns were about his weekly efforts in his own patch. Nevertheless, I look forward to reading Higgins pieces.<br />Higgins shares current knowledge about new plants (plants that once could not be grown successfully in the Washington area that now can be grown here thanks to genetic engineering), as well as creative ideas about older plants--some never used in local gardens. For example, regarding the latter, this past he wrote a piece on the Hyssop, which some of us have in herb beds, and he recommends for the perennial bed because it can stand up to the heat and humidity of DC (greatly exaggerated by old thinking -- DC actually has a relatively nice climate, just loss of oxygen thanks to car/SUV engines).  Unfortunately, his gardening ideas mostly extend to those with five acres to spare.<br />The essays in Higgins book are good but I would hesitate to describe it as the &quot;ultimate&quot; guide. The Mid-Atlantic area is comprised of a diverse range of growing conditions and it is difficult to generalize gardening tactics let alone ultimate techniques. Higgins is aware of the growing conditions, but the novice may find it difficult to keep the &quot;facts&quot; straight.<br />The altitude in the mid-Atlantic ranges from the mountains to the sea level, and from above and below the Mason-Dixon line. DC itself is located in the upper range of many plants that do well in zone 8 to the south (Crepe Myrtle) and in the lower range of plants that do well in zone 6 to the north (Peonies). However, if you go east you move into Zone 8 again and if you go west you enter Zone 6.<br />The soil composition of the area ranges from limestone (water in DC is very alkaline thanks to the Shenandoah Valley) to clay (Piedmont) to coastal sand. I've worked gardens in all these areas and found the combination of soil, water PH and weather patterns/temperture does not allow one to grow anything anywhere. In fact, if you live east of the fall line (approximately Route 1) and between Fredericksburg and mid-Jersey you'd be better off to read Allen Lacy's books.<br />Still, I don't want to discourage readers from using Higgin's book. Many of his ideas will work--the key is to buy the types of plants that like your growing conditions. Blueberries for example come in different varieties--some do well in cooler mountain areas and others along the sandy shore. You won't know if Higgins methods work until you try them. That's the key to gardening anyway--try-al and error.do well in zone 6 to the north (Peonies).

In the Sucevita Cloisters in Sucevita Romania a painted vault depicts a repeated rhomboid design in the shape of a pillar. Wooden funery columns in Loman Cemetery in Hunedoara, Transylvania, Romania also exhibit the rhomboidal design, albeit on a much more articulated, differentiated, and elaborate scale.<br />The Romanina artist, Constantin Brancusi brought the image of the rhomboid pillar to his wonderful sculpture the &quot;Endless Column.&quot; For Brancusi, the rhomboid pillar was the embodiment of the &quot;axis mundi&quot;, the world's axis, the tree of life, the pillar of the sky, the pivot of the universe. He once referred to these columns as stairways to heaven. Peoples all over the world have used the metaphysical pillar to link the earth and the sun, the source of all life.<br />The pillar image may not seem as fresh today as it did when arrived on the Paris art scene in the early 20th Century, but today, many art critics view the Romanian-born Parisian sculptor Brancusi as a major player in the Modern art movement. Along with Picasso, Brancusi introduced the notion of using traditional art forms in Western art--including 'totem' poles or sacred pillars, stone plinths, and other metaphysical carvings.<br />BRANCUSI was published by the Philadelphia Museum of Art in conjunction with a major retrospective of his work. Brancusi apparently deplored analytic attempts to understand his art (he felt his works should simply be &quot;enjoyed&quot; i.e. the fill the viewer with joy). However, the book is filled with material designed to help the reader &quot;understand&quot; and to a great extent, I feel it accomplishes it's goal.<br />The layout includes photographs showing how Brancusi may have found inspiration for his many birds, heads, and other organic and metaphysical works, including his rhomboidal columns. For example, one series of photographs shows Brancusi's famous &quot;Muse&quot; series executed in marble, bronze, and other media, and includes possible sources of inspiration such as a photograph and self-portrait of Margit Pogany. The various &quot;Muse&quot; may have evolved from a semi-formal bust similar to those executed by more traditional artists to a fully evolved &quot;essence&quot; of &quot;head&quot; more akin to Modern art.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who desires a pictoral record of the artist at work as well as many flat representations of his wonderfully formed three-dimensional sculptures and carvings.sible sources of inspiration such as a photograph and self-portrait of Margit Pogany.

CERAMICS, WAYS OF CREATION is a highly informative look at 36 contemporary artists who are &quot;pouring&quot; ceramics, working with the wheel, and molding various kinds of clay. I don't know if these artists are the best in the world, or who could possible determine that, but all the artists depicted are working in America, and most seem to have acquired a M.F.A. and some recognition among peers and critics.<br />Probably the most valuable aspect of CERAMICS is the light it sheds on the contempory ceramics work scene.  The artists seem to be fairly representative of their art/craft. Porcelain and raku, organic and inorganic, poured, molded, pressed and pinched, utilitarian and nonutilitarian, spritual and irreverent, functional and disfunctional are represented.<br />For example, Ray Strassberg's Holocaust vision and David MacDonald's African pots and calabashes are opposite ends of the life-death spectrum. Wayne Higby's beautiful and evocative &quot;Lake Powell Memory-Rain&quot; is somewhere in-between. Virginia Scotchie's &quot;Vera's Garden&quot; of stylized ceramic plants as big as the artist regenerate her memory of life as a child on her grandparents farm. The metaphysical &quot;Primal Courage&quot; of Joanne Hayakawa shows a stiff backbone (skeleton and pelvis) and Peter Pinnell brings the reader back to teatime with his wonderful teapots.<br />Each section contains a short biography of the artist and discusses themes, types of clay, modeling techniques, firing temperatures, tempura, and other aspects of the creative process. The book also contains an appendix of terms. Probably not technical enough for the ceramics artist, but a wonderful book for those who are thinking of taking up the craft and want to appear semi-literate at the local art center.	2001-07-14

WITCHCRAFT IN THE MIDDLE AGES by Jeffrey Russell is a salient and well-written history about religious persecution during the Middle Ages involving individuals accused of the practice of &quot;witchcraft&quot;. WITCHCRAFT was first published in the early 1970s when a renewed interest in the craft was gaining public attention.<br />Adherents of the craft have suffered a severe and enduring persecution--worse than any other religious persecution--including that of the Jews. Even today, in an era when folks pat themselves on the back for their religious &quot;tolerence&quot; and/or secular outlook, &quot;witchcraft&quot; is still largely misunderstood.  Even the name is a misnomer.<br />Russell, who seems mostly objective, refers to the modern practice of &quot;witchcraft&quot; as &quot;puerile&quot; indicating he does not really understand the practice per se. Russell is not a participant-observer, he is an outsider examining in as objective a manner as possible events that transpired over a period of thousand years. He does not examine and order these events from the perspective of the practicioner being persecuted, he arranges them from the standpoint of the authories who now wonder what happened.<br />Russell says currently there are four views extant in the West concerning &quot;witchcraft&quot; -- mainstream Roman Catholics, Protestants and Jewish groups pretty much ignore it; Fundamentalist Judeo-Christian groups see it as a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; and &quot;the work of the devil&quot;; Liberals see it as silly or sick behaviour ignorant church people persecute and mentally deranged and confused souls practice; Ethnographers describe &quot;witchcraft&quot; as worldwide and real, with devoted adherents.<br />In the Middle Ages, the practice of &quot;witchcraft&quot; was associated with the diverse behaviors of various individuals or groups who for one reason or another found themselves on the wrong side of church law--first Roman Catholic and then Protestant Reformed. Russell says amazingly, individuals who participated in the Renaissance and Reformation, who overturned, destroyed, and abandoned many of the practices of the Church of Rome, retained the Catholic position on &quot;witchcraft&quot; and persecuted people suspected of the practice with a vengence unequaled by their predecessors.<br />Russell examines the roots of the Chistian attitude toward witchcraft. He says that during the Babylonian captivity, when the Jews were cruelly carried off and enslaved, they came to accept the reality of evil. Through their efforts to understand and deal with evil, they accepted it must have a creator, i.e. a source. But how can a good God be the source of evil? Enter the devil.<br />Russell says the dual thinking of the Jews (God and Satan--he provides many Biblical references to Satan--including the book of JOB), combined with the Greco-Roman belief in daemons (angelic entities who communicated with the gods) influenced thinking in the newly evolved Christian world. As the Church fathers grappled with folk beliefs that included Roman lares/penates and Celtic/Germanic Valkyries, fairies, elves and  other supernatural folks, they came to believe Satan ruled all these magical creatures.<br />During the Middle Ages, individuals punished for &quot;witchcraft&quot; (evil practicies associated with Satan) fell into a number of different categories. Russell attempts to tease these categories apart and determine what &quot;witchcraft&quot; was (the concept and definition changed over time) and who exactly engaged in the practices that came to be viewed as &quot;witchcraft&quot; (many people of diverse interest and background did many different things--or were accused of doing these things).<br />Russell says for the most part, the church viewed individuals accused of &quot;witchcraft&quot; as heretics--i.e. engaged in non-church approved religious practices. The most famous example is the Cathars. Cathars were accused of witchcraft based on their dualistic belief in the brothers Jesus and Satan. Some non-Cathars accused of &quot;witchcraft&quot; were probably mentally deranged if their testimony is to be belived and the church on occasion recognized these sick souls for what they were--in writing.  There were those accused of witchcraft, however, who were engaging in magical practices involving herbs, charms, illness, childbirth, and other aspects of daily living. Early records indicate these souls existed long before the church took an interest in their behavior. Much of what these practicioners believed and did was an outgrowth of their pagan beliefs. Russell says the brothers have Grimm recorded much of their belief system as &quot;fairytales&quot;.<br />&quot;Witchcraft&quot; and its adherents came to be viewed as evil because the church could not condone magic practiced outside God's proscribed domain--and of course the church leaders determined what that domain was so this was basically a control issue. The church itself practiced magic--there is no other way to describe prayer and indulgences designed to manipulate God. The miracles of Christ and the Saints--turning water into wine, walking on water, raising the dead, expanding fishes and loaves to feed the multitude, etc. may be divine magic but are nevertheless magic.<br />Russell has divided his book into several chapters that deal with early, middle, and late phases of the Middle Ages. He notes that while some would define the later years as early Renaissance, he defines the Middle ages from the years following the demise of Rome's rule in Europe to the end of the 1400s when the Church in Rome lost control of Christianity in Europe.<br />This is an exellent book and a good place to start if you want to know more about the church's persecution of people accused of &quot;witchcraft&quot; during the Middle Ages.

THE WILDEST PLACE ON EARTH by John Hanson Mitchell is a semi-autobiographical account of how a nature writer based in Thoreau's old stomping grounds in New England became enchanted. The subtitle of Hanson's book is &quot;Italian Gardens and the Invention of Wilderness.&quot;<br />Mr. Hanson begins his writing as Thoreau began, complaining about the &quot;developers&quot; who are wrecking the local countryside. He then discusses the concept of countryside--which some view as &quot;wilderness.&quot;  But what is wilderness? He decides to investigate, and his investigation takes him back to the begnning--to the garden of paradise.<br />The original wilderness may have been frightening, but it had an enchanted center--a sacred garden. Within this garden lived a mystical creature, half beast and half man. To reach the sacred garden one had to pass through a maze. On some level, humans &quot;remember&quot; the enchanted garden and have attempted recreate it over and over with various mazes and gardens. It would seem all human effort in some way is an effort to get back to the beginning.<br />Hanson interweaves Western myths, garden-making, maze-making, conservation of the natural world, artistic principles, and personal humor into his story. Ariadne, Theseus, Daedalus, and the other characters fill his pages.  The Great God Pan is his personal friend--he of cloven hoof who has managed to infiltrate the most sacred places including the center of the maze in Chartres Cathedral.<br />If you're a literary buff, an nature lover, a gardener, a witch or a pagan, you will love this book.	2001-07-04

THE ONCE AND FUTURE GARDENER, GARDEN WRITING FROM THE GOLDEN AGE OF MAGAZINES 1900 to 1940, by Virginia Clayton is a collection of articles printed in leading &quot;women's&quot; magazines over the first half of the past century. Although some of the ideas in these articles remain salient, and Clayton has inserted the current scientific (Latin) notation beside each named plant described and/or recommended by the various authors, this book is not as much a garden book as it is a useful resource for garden historians or readers who want to take a trip down memory lane.<br />Clayton has organized the book into seven sections that cover these topics &quot;A year in the garden&quot;; &quot;Gardening with trees, roses and shrubs&quot;; &quot;Flower garden designs&quot;; &quot;Wild gardens&quot;; &quot;Old-fashioned gardens&quot;; &quot;Formal Italian gardens&quot;; and &quot;The Philosphical gardener.&quot; Most of the articles are relatively short, and a few are several pages.  I most enjoyed the section on Italian gardens which Americans seem to dislike, according to several of the authors, but are the basis for most western garden design. I don't know that I agree with this notion, or even if it is true, but these authors make convincing cases.<br />I had not realized what a profound affect Edith Wharton had had on the garden writers of her time--the early 1900s. She traveled quite a lot in her mature years, principally with Henry James, and she spent a good deal of time in Italy. Her observations about her trips are quoted in several places. This is an interesting book and good reading for those who may wonder what their grandmothers read on those cold winter nights during winter when they planned next year's garden.	2001-06-30

I've been organic gardening since the 1960s and I find GAIA'S GARDEN--A GUIDE TO HOME-SCALE PERMACULTURE contains much useful information for the gardener who wants to work with Mother Nature instead of against her.<br />In his book, Toby Hemingway says &quot;permaculture is a set of techniques and principles for designing sustainable human settlements.&quot; Permaculture uses organic gardening principles to deal with big as well as little problems. Permaculture is involved with the local rose and the ecosystem within which the local rose lives. Most of the ideas Hemenway suggests have been &quot;out there&quot; for some time, but Hemingway combines and organizes this cumulative knowledge into a coherent approach. While I don't agree with everything Hemenway suggests, I think most of his ideas are worth trying.<br />Hemenway seems to have acquired much of his hands-on experience in semi-arid areas on the West Coast, so some of his &quot;live and let-live&quot; tactics may not work on the more lush East Coast. For example, Hemenway appears to be opposed to fighting certain kinds of invasive plants, some of them exotic (i.e. not native), but to me the whole purpose of my garden is to have something that does not look like the rest of the surrounding area--whatever that is--so, I will never give up the effort to keep certain plants OUT. On the other hand, I have discovered I can tolerate some &quot;wildness&quot; in my patch, and have given over certain parts of the yard to natural vegetation (as long as it does not include, poison ivy, bindweed, prickle vine..you get the picture) which the National Wildlife Federation would approve as bird-friendly.<br />Hemenway's &quot;plan&quot; is geared to the 1/4 acre lot, so folks in the suburbs with more space than me may be able to accomodate more of his ideas. However, I think some of his ideas can be adapted to a smaller space. One thing I really like about this book is his novel approach to laying out beds.  No raised boxes or perennial borders here.  He goes for keyholes, spirals, wreaths, and all sorts of novel shapes.  And they work. I've laid out beds to fit my space and the result is some oddly designed garden areas that are beautiful (my whole yard is a collection of garden beds, I have NO grass).<br />I particularly support the building of swales to retain ground moisture, and using leftover woody material to build &quot;Hugelkultur&quot; compost heaps.  Whenever we replace fence material, trim bushes or trees, or create other woody waste, we bury it at the back of the garden.  I also throw newspapers, paper towels (7th Generation of course), and other biodegradable paper into the compost bin.  And speaking of compost, adding it directly to the bed is a good idea. Just slip it under the existing mulch, or grab a shovelful of mulch to toss over it.  This way the garden gets the full benefit of the decomposing material, not the area around the compost bin.<br />This is a wonderful book filled with wonderful ideas that hold the key to saving our world.xes or perennial borders here.

Heilbrun is a bit older than me, I'll be 60 next year, and I thank her for writing THE LAST GIFT OF TIME-LIFE BEYOND SIXTY. I like the book so much, I am sending a copy to my sister who is also approaching the big 6-0. Over and over again Heilbrun has written just the book I needed to read at just the time I needed to read it--LIFE is &quot;right on time.&quot; (Other books I've enjoyed include TOWARD A RECOGNITION OF ANDROGENY, REINVENTING WOMANHOOD, AND WRITING A WOMAN'S LIFE). Heilbrun is one of my &quot;unmet&quot; friends (described in THE LAST GIFT OF TIME).<br />Reading the younger reviewer who obviously didn't &quot;get&quot; Heilbrun causes me to suspect 1)she does not work with men; and/or 2) she is not old enough to appreciate what her older female &quot;sisters&quot; have accomplished. Women struggling with the daily Chinese water-torture of patronizing and discounting males in the workplace (never subtle), and/or older women who lived through the 50s and 60s who were not allowed to attend &quot;men's&quot; schools or hold &quot;men's&quot; jobs will appreciate Heilbrun. (As will enlightened men.) Although the women's movement has accomplished much, much remains to be done. As Heilbrun points out, until the preference for male babies ends and the existence of &quot;pompous, self-satisfied, established males&quot; is terminated, the movement is not over.<br />Heilbrun's chapters are conversational, newsy, and cheerful.  They contain the sort of friendly advice you seek from an old friend. Yes, get a computer and learn how to use email. My aunts in their 80s have learned how to log on and write mail to each other and their children and nieces and nephews. Like Heilbrun's family, we are a reconnected family again. If you have an older relative, help them become computer literate.<br />Heilbrun says enjoy slacks!!! I laughed out loud when I looked in my old 1959 high school year book and recalled that we girls were &quot;allowed&quot; to wear pants to school one day a year, the day we worked on the homecoming floats (I'm not given to looking backwards, the younger gals in the office wanted me to bring my yearbook to work so I checked it out beforehand to make sure it contained no embarrasing moments). I also had the unpleasant experience in 1973 of being &quot;thrown out&quot; of the commisary at the local army post because I had had dared to enter the store wearing pants. I had a full cart of groceries and was in the check-out lane. I had to go home with my three children under age 10 in tow, change clothes and drive back to the store and start all over again. You better believe Heilbrun's chapter &quot;On not wearing dresses&quot; stuck a cord with me.<br />In &quot;The dog who came to stay&quot; Heilbrun shares her experiences with Bianca the Black Shepherd. She says a dog can get you out for that walk you need every day and provide you with all the unconditional love you can stand. Her section on men is equally informative. She says, if you get a cat you should expect he will scratch the furniture, and you make up your mind you will tolerate his &quot;catty&quot; behavior because you love him--don't try to change his nature. If you can be tolerant of your pets habits, you can be tolerant of your husband's habits too.

May Sarton wrote poetry, novels, children's books, anthologies, and nonfiction, but she may be remembered longest for her journals. AT SEVENTY takes place in 1982, when Sarton lived in New England at her rural retreat with her vast garden and her two cats--one a present from Carolyn Heilbrun.<br />Sarton begins AT SEVENTY with the arrival of the daffodils &quot;a tiny bunch of miniature daffodils, blue starflowers, and glory be two fritillaries.&quot;  She is back from a month of poetry reading in Connecticut and remarks that her friend Edith Haddaway has left a small bunch of roses for her birthday.<br />Over the course of the book, Sarton describes her daily struggles with her garden, her typewriter, and her overcommittment to persons and events that seem to keep her from &quot;solitude&quot; and hence writing. Her journal is filled with the activities of a life fairly well lived, though she is not without some regrets and sad remembrances including the loss of her European homeland. AT SEVENTY provides the reader with a peak behind the scenes of how Sarton coped with growing older and the day-to-day necessary interruptions of living, and yet managed to create poetry and other writing.<br />Sarton	2001-06-25

My son gave me FIVE CENTURIES OF WOMEN AND GARDENS for Christmas last year.  He purchased the book in London at the National Portrait Gallery where it is sold in the gift shop.  This is a beautiful book, slick paper and lots of pretty pictures and text distilled from eons of research.<br />Enclosed with the book is a &quot;guide&quot; to portraits found in the &quot;Escape to Eden&quot; gallery trail in the Portrait Gallery. One can follow the Eden trail and view paintings of 11 or more women involved with gardening whose portrait hangs in the national gallery. The book is not limited to these 11 paintings, however. It includes many other paintings, photographs, and portraits associated with women and gardening in England. The gallery used the book as an organizing principle for viewing some of its exhibits.<br />Paintings include, 'Elizabeth I by Hilliard' depicted in this book as Diana the White Goddess or Goddess of the Moon, the holding the eglintine rose symbol of the Tudors. Other portraits include Elizabeth Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury (Bess of Hardwicke shown in a separate photo); Anne of Denmark; Lucy Countess of Bedford; Henrietta Maria.<br />From the 18th-early 19th centuries--one of my favorites is included--Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, Princess of Wales, the long suffering wife of George III and mother of George IV, depicted in the film THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE. George III built his home at Kew, and the grounds and gardens near Richmond have become the National Botanical Gardens.<br />The book continues into modern times with flower and nature paintings by Marianne North and a famous portrait of Gertrude Jekyll, a top garden designer of the late 19th and early 20th century who pioneered the perennial border. Shots include some of the gardens and grand houses she influenced.<br />The book ends with a portrait of Beatrix Potter and a photograph of Vita de Sackville West, garden columnist and friend of Virgina Wolfe, shown with her hoe in hand, lace-up garden boots, and very big dog sitting on stairs in one of the paths in her White Garden at Sissinghurst.<br />This is a lovely book, and one I have enjoyed as a gift from a son who knows how much I love England and gardens.arden boots, and very big dog sitting on stairs in one of the paths in her White Garden at Sissinghurst. <br />This is a lovely book, and one I have enjoyed as a gift from a son who knows how much I love England and gardens.	2001-06-23

Ellis Davidson wrote GODS AND MYTHS OF NORTHERN EUROPE around forty years ago, when other people's belief systems were viewed as myths and Christianity was viewed as &quot;the one true religion&quot; even by scholars.  Although Davidson was objective as she could be and still be published, a modern scholar would have less concern with what other people think. Still, this book is a useful place to begin if you seek to know more about the gods of the Germans, Swedes, Danes and other northern people.<br />Davidson relies on three main sources, Procopius (writing in the early 6th Century in Byzantium), Tacitus (writing in the later Roman Empire), and Snorri Sturlson who attempted to set down the story he found in Iceland in the Prose Edda in the early Middle Ages.<br />Davidson says of Sturlson, &quot;There is little doubt that on the whole Snorri has given us a faithful picture of heathen mythology as he found it in the poets.&quot;  Davidson has some reservations about the Prose Edda, however, because it records  what had heretofore been an oral tradition. However, all early history has an oral basis, including the Bible. Modern archeology is providing much evidence that what is found in these older texts has a basis in fact.<br />Why should you read this book?  If you are an opera fan, you will learn more about the Valkyries, Valhalla, and the Ring Cycle. If you're a fan of literature you will gain insight into the symbols contained in poems and prose. You might better understand Beowolf or Elliot's poem &quot;The Wasteland.&quot; If you are interested old paintings, you might better understand some of the attributes of saints, or other &quot;holy&quot; people. Tarot readers  may better understand the cards. If you puzzle over fairytales and nursery rhymes you may find enlightenment.<br />Those with an interest in WWII will come to understand where Hitler obtained some of his ideas (a student of German history he was familiar with the warrior tales which he used to rally his own troops). Those who are interested in the underpinnings of the current neo-Nazi movement may find some interesting material in these pages.<br />Sadly, northern stories have become tainted by the interest of modern terrorists, but they have an intrinsic worth any serious student of religion will recognize. It doesn't take much imagination to see that the tales of Christian saints and even Christ as depicted in northern Europe were heavily influenced by Northern &quot;mythology&quot;.<br />A good part of the Roman Catholic traning I received as a child, including praying to various saints for special favors, is rooted in northern mythology in disguise (and I wouldn't have had it any other way). For one seeking understanding of  forebears (even Protestants) this book is a delightful discovery.<br />When I was a child and &quot;it&quot; thundered and lightening struck, my Protestant-converted-to-Catholic mother (who attended seances on Fridays with my Dutch Reformed Grandmother) always said &quot;it&quot; was god and his angels bowling in heaven. Davidson tells of Woden and Odin rolling their chariots across heaven, the root of the word &quot;thunder&quot; from the Thor, the thunder god, and the rolling of heads of the dead.<br />You may recognize the analogy in the tales of Washington Irving, who wrote about Rip Van Winckle and bowling and Ichabod Crane and thuderous hooves of a headless horseman. Irving like my mother was Dutch. The Dutch have not forgotten their &quot;myths&quot; and I suspect neither have the Germans or other northern people.

In CLINGING TO THE WRECKAGE, John Mortimer covered his childhood and young adulthood, marriage to his first wife Penelope and the family of six children, and his entry into British Law as a Queen's Counsel (QC).  He only tangentially wrote about his literary accomplishments including his books SUMMER'S LEASE, the RUMPOLE series, and the Titmuss Trilogy, and his work as a screen writer on various plays including BRIDESHEAD REVISITED.<br />In MURDERERS AND OTHER FRIENDS Mortimer continues the saga of his life with tales from his days as a QC defending an assortment of clients from Sex Pistols to serial killers, tales of his work with the Labor Party, anectdotes about his marriage to wife Penny (#2), and an in-depth look behind the scenes at the creative process that led to his various artistic triumps including the creation of Rumpole of the Bailey.<br />It doesn't take too much imagination to see that Mortimer is Rumpole (except for the kids, he acquires two more in this book bringing the total to eight). It seems those tales we've read in the Rumpole series are based on real stories. The problem Mortimer says, is that he has had to tone down the real tales to make them believable as fiction. For example, in one of the Rumpole tales, a man is accused of attacking his wife because she made him sit next to the taps when they took their bath together. In the real case, he did not merely attack her, he killed her.<br />Mortimer also shares &quot;behind the scenes&quot; stories about his other creative efforts.  He tells of his first encounter with Lawrence Olivier and how Olivier came to play the father in two of his productions, TRAVELS ROUND MY FATHER and BRIDESHEAD REVISITED.  He tells of seeing the fabulous John Gielgud on stage as a child, then having him play an aging journalist in SUMMER'S LEASE.  He tells of his friendships with David Niven and Rex Harrison and their rivalry. He shares anectdotes about other famous friends and their children.  Some of those famous children include Emma Thompson and Natasha Richardson.<br />As a playwright and author, Mortimer has mingled with the cream of the British artistic world, and but this is not an expose of his friends and acquaintences--unless they are conservative members of Parliament, murderers, or other degenerates.<br />All of Mortimer's tales are told with humor, but occasionally, a sad note creeps in.  It is impossible to reach the age of 83 and not have had at least a few sad moments.  What Mortimer is able to do however, is find a way to keep the reader smiling at the foibles of human beings including himself.  This is a very funny book and I recommend it to anyone who is fan of BBC/PBS productions.mous children include Emma Thompson and Natasha Richardson.<br />As a playwright and author, Mortimer has mingled with the cream of the British artistic world, and but this is not an expose of his friends and acquaintences--unless they are conservative members of Parliament, murderers, or other degenerates.<br />All of Mortimer's tales are told with humor, but occasionally, a sad note creeps in.

CLINGING TO THE WRECKAGE is the first of John Mortimer's three-part autobiography (to date--as of 2001 he is 83 years of age and going strong). Mortimer is known to BBC/PBS fans as the multi-talened writer who developed the screenplays for the TV series BRIDESHEAD REVISITED based on Evelyn Waugh's book of the same name; creator of Rumpole, Queen's Counsel (QC) for the underdog; and author of many novels including the Titmuss trilogy, and SUMMER'S LEASE. In WRECKAGE, John tells of his childhood and young adulthood.<br />Mortimer grew up the son of a British barrister/counselor and his wife a former artist.  Against his will he was sent off to boarding school at an early age. However, Mortimer's father lost his eyesight owing to a retinal detachment that could not be repaired. As a result the family source of income was placed in jeopardy and young John and his mother became his father's eyes helping him prepare his legal briefs.<br />Mortimer says he fell in love with the theater at an early age. His family made pilgrimages to Stratford-on-Avon to see the great Royal Shakespeare company perform the bard's works. There he was able to see Lawrence Olivier, John Gielgud, and other fabulous actors of the period. These theater experiences coupled with his work on his father's briefs, led to his own career as a QC, and planted a love of the English language and the theater in the young John which led to his subsequent success in the theater, on television, and in his many books.<br />The book also covers his first marriage to Penelope, with whom he formed a family of six childen which included her four daughters from a previous marriage.<br />Whether or not you have been lucky enough to enjoy the witty dialogue of Rumpole--including his verbal exchanges with wife Hilda (SHE WHO MUST BE OBEYED), the clever plot twists of the Titmuss series, or the wonderful and inspirational BRIDESHEAD REVISITED, you will love this book if you love Brit Wit.  Mortimer is incredibly human and very funny.and very funny.	2001-06-16

I was attracted to the cover because it shows one of my favorite plants, the pink Echinacea Purpurea. Good things do come in nice packages, however, because when I opened the book I found the contents were practical and useful. I had been standing in the &quot;herbal&quot; section of the store trying to remember whether Anise and Licorice were the same thing, and all I could remember was that Anisette has a licorice flavor. The clerk could not help me, and she could not find the answer in her guide book.  Brinker's book told me they are different, and it also told me I should not take Licorice since I have high blood pressure.<br />I wanted the Anise because I thought it might help relieve my Arthritus pains, but the book informed me that in addition to the Black Cohosh I was already taking for other purposes (symtoms of menopause--it replaced Premarin), Devil's Claw might be helpful. It also told me Ginger could prove useful if I took it regularly. (I take it occasionally now. For me, Ginger has replaced Zantac, but Brinker does not address Ginger's use as an aid to indigestion).<br />Well, this is all round about, but the bottom line is that I have books and books on this subject, and yet I found even more information in this book--and Brinker's information augments rather than contradicts what I already know. Francis Brinker is a trained &quot;naturopath&quot; --different from a homeopath.  Naturopthy is a &quot;system of medicine that utilizes natural substances, forces, and methods to increase vitality and support the healing power of nature.&quot;  Homeopathy according to Brinker deals with the symptoms of problems that already exist. (One seems proactive and the other reactive.)<br />Brinker advises the reader to work with his/her physician and I do. My physician is great. He supports my use of various herbal remedies, supplements, etc. I have a complete physical every year, excercise regularly, and eat carefully most of the time(and when I don't I pay the price), which Brinker also advises.<br />Brinker's book warns the reader about herbal and other plant remedies that are not organic and green. Certain plants are near extinction. Some companies producing herbal extracts are organic and green, while others are not. I look for the Oregon and California seal of approval on organic products. It's foolish to use plant extracts gathered from plants sprayed with toxins and it's stupid to help exterminate a valuable plant.<br />Brinker has two undergraduate degrees in biology from &quot;ordinary&quot; schools (including the University of Kansas where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa), and he is a graduate of the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland Oregon. He also completed a two year postgraduate program in Botanical Medicine.  His training is not mainstream, but so far mainstream science has not had all the answers. Mainstream medicine involves fixing things after they are broken. Brinker addresses issues before they occur. Both approaches have something to offer.a complete physical every year, excercise regularly, and eat carefully most of the time(and when I don't I pay the price), which Brinker also advises. <br />Brinker's book warns the reader about herbal and other plant remedies that are not organic and green.

In LOUIS XI THE UNIVERSAL SPIDER, biographer-historian Paul Murray Kendall says the Burgundian chronicler Molinet called Louis &quot;the universal spider&quot; and the sobriquet unfortunately stuck. He says Louis was further demonized by 19th Century historians and writers who failed to do their homework. Louis XI was not so much spider as he was diplomat and peace-maker in an age when men looked suspiciously on such behaviour, and combat was viewed as the honorable and noble approach to settling disputes. Louis used his head and the end result was to bring the feudal era in France to a close and help usher in the modern world.<br />Louis reckoned the ceaseless bickering and fighting of the nobles was destructive to the health of the countryside and the people of France. The common people of the towns and villages agreed with Louis as did the merchants and tradesmen.  Louis is not remembered for winning any great battles. The major reason Louis was so successful in defeating his enemies was owing to his understanding of finance. He understood that those who fight must finance their wars and without funds, their access to armaments and mercenaries evaporates. The clever king also understood that when the countryside is destroyed an army that crawls on its belly cannot fight.<br />Charles VII was the father of Louis XI, that same Dauphin whom Joan the Maid of Orleans managed to have crowned. The ungrateful Charles VII did nothing to save Joan once she had been captured by the English and the Duke of Burgundy, but the six-year old boy who became Louis XI never forgot the saint and he held a lifelong devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary after his encounter with her. When Louis was most pressed he prayed to the Virgin, and his monument to her at Clery still exists.<br />The Duke of Burgundy during Charles VII's reign was Phillip the Good, and when Louis XI ran afoul of his father, he sought shelter with Duke Phillip who sheltered him. Thus Louis spent a good part of his young manhood in the company of his dour cousin Charles the Bold who became the Duke of Burgundy on his father's death. Charles also became Louis' life-long enemy and it was Charles' man who slandered Louis by referring to him as &quot;the universal spider.&quot;<br />Louis had one aspiration--to unite France in peace, and promote commerce and the general welfare of the people. Charles the Bold fancied himself another Julius Caesar--a warrior-king.  Charles set about expanding his Duchy until Burgundy reached from the county of Burgundy near the Jura mountains to Flanders and Holland on the North Sea.<br />Louis was no warrior-king. While other lords ran around in ermine and velvet and jousted at tournaments, Louis donned the hunter's clothes and spent most days in the rural areas chasing animals with his hunting dogs and comingling with the common folk. When he wasn't hunting animals Louis collected them for his vast menagerie.<br />On most occasions Louis tried to make peace not war. He used his head, outwitted his enemies including the English king Edward IV, and at the end of his life left his heir Charles VIII a united France. Kendall obviously admired Louis and remarks that he was one of the most formidable human beings who ever lived.<br />I have been reading the series Alison Weir has been writing on the English nobility, and enjoyed reading LOUIS XI not only because I want to know more about the history of France, but because in reading about Louis XI, I was able to understand why certain exchanges, conflicts, etc. regarding Edward IV were important. If you found Alison Weir's book on the WAR OF THE ROSES intriguing, you will appreciate this book. Kendall's writing is comparable to Weir's and he has based his writing on his original research--though he is quite dependent on Commynes as are most of Louis' biographers.<br />I bought this book from Alibris, and I recommend you find a copy if you're interested in this period of history. I am puzzled as to why this book is out of print.o why this book is out of print.	2001-06-11

I read Mary Catherine Bateson's book COMPOSING A LIFE when it was first issued some years ago. I had read her mother's biography BLACKBERRY WINTER, and I wanted to know more about the child raised by the woman who wrote COMING OF AGE IN SAMOA. Bateson's mother was married three times -- twice to anthropologists, including Gregory Bateson, Mary Catherine's father and Margaret Mead's third husband.<br />I was pleasantly surprised by Mary Catherine's strong individual personality and the inspirational tone of her book. Bateson definitely escaped her parents shadow. Having famous parents who study other people's children doesn't mean your life will be perfect or easy. Mary Catherine had to find her own way and compose her own life. Finding her way meant &quot;stepping outside the box&quot; or realizing that she could make choices at any point.  She did not have to conform to society's notion of the phases of life (maybe her mother's study of &quot;coming of age&quot; had some effect on her novel thinking?).<br />Bateson's book helped me to think about my own life differently.  I found the courage to go back to school at age 28 (I was a high school dropout with three small children), earn a B.A., M.A. and complete all the coursework for a PhD. Today, I am a a subject matter expert for one of the Federal Government's leading statistical agencies. At age 28, I had no idea how far I could go, or that I even wanted to go there. Mary Catherine Bateson was one of those pioneering women who helped me realize it is possible to change your life.	2001-06-06

IN A DARK WOOD WANDERING by Hella Haase is one of the most profound books I have ever read. My 85-year old aunt, a retired school teacher, lives in an apartment complex in Sheboygan Wisconsin along with other seniors, many of them also retired teachers. One of her best friends, a retired French teacher named Marie recommended IN A DARK WOOD WANDERING.<br />IN A DARK WOOD WANDERING is the story of Charles, Duke of Orleans, grandson of a king, nephew of a king, cousin of the French dauphine saved by Joan of Arc, and father of the man who followed Louis the Spider king to the throne. Most importantly, Charles, Duke of Orleans was a great French poet of the Middle Ages. Some think he is comparable to Dante in Italy or Chaucer in England.<br />It's easy to become tangled in Louises and Charleses, but here goes: Charles (our hero) had a father, Louis, Duke of Orleans, who was the brother of Charles VI--one of the kings of France during the 100 Years War between England and France. Charles VI was the French king who was bested by Henry V the English king at the battle of Agincourt. When we see Shakespeare's play 'Henry the V' we see the English version of events at Agincourt. Few of us think about the dreadful day from the perspective of the French who saw many of their finest young men killed or captured.<br />Charles, Duke of Orleans, was captured at Agincourt. Owing to the politics at home (the sympathy of the House of Orleans for the young Dauphin--Charles VI's son), the Duke of Orleans was not ransomed by the Duke of Burgundy, as was the custom in those days, but allowed to languish as a prisoner in England for most of his adult life. Charles younger half-brother continued the Orleans struggle on behalf of the dauphine who would become Charles VII in 1427.<br />In 1422, when Charles VI died, his young son was prevented from assuming the throne by the Duke of Burgundy. About this time, a young woman had a vision that instructed her to leave her small village and travel to Orleans and help the Dauphin. She persuaded the House of Orleans she could help their cause. Joan the Maid of Orleans bested the English and the Duke of Burgundy, and suceeded in taking the Dauphin to Paris where he was crowned Charles VII. Later, Joan was captured by the English and burned as a witch by the Duke of Burgundy.<br />While he was a prisoner in England, from 1415 to 1450, Charles, Duke of Orleans was aware of the events back home in France and his family's continued struggles with the Duke of Burgundy. He knew of the association of Jeanne d'Arc and the House of Orleans. As a manifestation of his appreciation of this connection and his growing spirituality, Charles, Duke of Orleans produced some of the most beautiful poetry ever written in French.<br />In addition to the story of Charles, Duke of Orleans' life, IN A DARK WOOD WANDERING contains excerpts of his beautiful poetry (in French and English). The title of this book refers to the topic of his poetry, the long journey of the soul which until it is united with the object of it's love is lost, in a dark wood, and wandering.avel to Orleans and help the Dauphin.

As a veteran of the stumbling around with four books in my backpack trying to make sense of the block where I'm standing approach to travel (I don't do guided tours), I became a happier person the day I discovered someone had compiled the highpoints of Venice into one accessible walker's guide. A LITERARY COMPANION TO VENICE by Ian Littlewood is a fine guide.<br />I'm a literary enthusiast and over the years I've managed to find Louisa May Alcott's home in Concord, the stone ranch house Jack London built in Northern California, the supposed location of Robert Louis Stevenson's grass hut in Hawaii, the house in Rye England where Henry James retired, Anne Frank's attic in Amsterdam, the ancient and dour building in Geneva where Calvin framed his sermons, and Hemingway's house in Key West (still inhabited by his cats' cats' cats).<br />Many authors have passed through Venice over the years, and some like Henry James and George Sand left written records of their visits. In LITERARY COMPANION, Littlewood guides the reader on seven tours of Venice, the seventh tour being &quot;North Venice&quot; -- including the island where the fabled San Giorgio Maggiore and the Lagoon were painted in an impressionist sunset captured by Turner.<br />Littlewood provides a map for each of his tours, and at each step along the way he dicusses what you are seeing, who saw it before you, and what they had to say about it. For example, on the tour of the Piazza San Marco, the reader is directed to look &quot;out across the Piazza&quot; and &quot;share the view with a fair number of pigeons..&quot; He says Oscar Wilde's Dorian Grey liked the view..&quot;Stretched on his sofa, he reads some lines of Gautier and thinks back to his stay in Venice&quot; 'The sudden flashes of colour reminded him of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter around the tall honeycombed Campanile....'&quot; Elizabeth Barrett Browning described the pigeons as &quot;holy.&quot;<br />A LITERARY COMPANION is not exhaustive, although it contains refererences to the visits and habitation of many illustrious persons including Dante who stayed in Venice when he had been expelled from Florence. If you want an in-depth story of Venice and it's visitors over the past 1,000 years, I suggest you read John J. Norwich's book VENICE. However, Littlewood's COMPANION will be the book you take to Venice, it's compact, light, and extremely useful.ANION is not exhaustive, although it contains refererences to the visits and habitation of many illustrious persons including Dante who stayed in Venice when he had been expelled from Florence.

THE STONES OF FLORENCE is a complex art history book Mary McCarthy first had published in 1959. The original contained photographs and this paperback has none.  I think my reading would have been a bit easier if I had seen the photographs, but perhaps they were few or not that good. I've taken enough art history classes that covered Italian art and traveled and visited museums housing Florentine art, so I could visualize many of the works McCarthy discusses. If you have no background on this suject you might find the book tough going. On the other hand, one has to start somewhere (though this may not be the best place). STONES is filled with enough anectdotal material to make it interesting, but if you don't aready know who Giotto, Cimabue, Ucello, Masaccio, Fra Agelico, Donatello and Brunelleschi were, McCarthy's discourse may prove dense at times.<br />McCarthy covers the history of Florence, but she is mainly interested in the Medieval and Renaissance art of the city so she moves very quickly to the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries. My sense is that she is favorably disposed to the Medieval art (13th and 14th), likes the Renaissance art a little less (14th and 15th), and positively dislikes the mad, bad Mannerists (16th). For example, describing the Mannerist Il Rosso's painting &quot;Moses Defending the Daughters of Jethro&quot; she says it reminds one of &quot;the half-carnival atmosphere of an insane asylum or of a brothel during a police raid.&quot;<br />McCarthy says Florentine art collapsed in the 16th Century and never recovered, largely owing to the Medicis--those former pharmacists who thought they understood art. She says perhaps the Mannerists only reflected what they saw--Florence as a commercial hub with no spritiual core.<br />She says Florence, unlike Venice and Sienna is a manly town. Although various illustrious visitors have been attacted to the city over the ages, like Queen Victoria who &quot;did water colors&quot; at Vincigliata, or Florence Nightengale's parents who named her for the city, they mostly preferred to stay in villas in the Tuscan countryside or other cities in Tuscany. Florence has been and remains a commercial city (home of Gucci and Feragamo) and for the most part, it's buildings are blocky, black and white, and businesslike. She says Florence was a Guelph city (for the Pope, one of whom was a Medici) and one of the many Guelph-Ghibilline conflicts that involved Florence took place with  Pistoia--source of the word pistol.<br />STONES is an interesting book and one that may provide you with some colorful information about the city of Florence, and perhaps persuade you to take your next vacation in Venice.Nightengale's parents who named her for the city, they mostly preferred to stay in villas in the Tuscan countryside or other cities in Tuscany.

1980824:US	51379338	R1T3RB9VLEXHW8	0312261675	803199481	A Grave Coffin: A Commander John Coffin Mystery	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Solid writing, grisley tale...	A GRAVE COFFIN by Gwendoline Butler is a good read. The book is mostly set in &quot;Second City&quot; (based on Docklands that is &quot;second&quot; after the City of London which is &quot;first&quot;). The Second City of COFFIN seems to be a figment of the author's imagination-at least I could not find any geographic correlation between her &quot;Second City&quot; and Docklands in the A-Z.<br />COFFIN is filled with scattered literary illusions for which a high school knowledge of English should provide adequate background, including references to Oxford and Lewis Carroll and black holes as well as drugs and Sherlock Holmes.<br />The setting for COFFIN is not as &quot;British&quot; as that found in books by P.D. James or Minette Walters where one can expect minute geographic details. In fact, the background for COFFIN puts me in mind of the Dalziel and Pascoe series--vaguly familiar but you would not be able to find it on a 7.5&quot; map.<br />The English in COFFIN is British and Butler has a wry sense of humor, but I enjoy the British sense of humor and am familiar with their terminology so I had no problem. If you know what buggery is you won't either. In fact, the strength of Butler's writing lies in the ironic thoughts of her lead character Coffin (and his dog Augustus, i.e. Gus) for whom he thinks.<br />The plot of A GRAVE COFFIN involves two tangentially related cases. The first case involves the manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals, in this instance not illegal drugs for a change but facsimiles of patented drugs that not only rip-off the patent holders but endanger the consumer. The second tale is grisley as it involves the sexual abuse, mutilation and deaths of four boys around age 10.<br />Butler does a good job of laying out her crimes, leading her detectives onward with clues, and tying up most of the loose ends. Although she is dealing with terrible murders, she does not dwell on the graphic aspects any more than necessary to futher her storyline. In other words, her descriptions of the mutilated corpses are not sensational.<br />Her cops engage in mostly realistic police work (not an impulsive lone dog in the bunch) although Butler finesses the detailed forensics explanations. Her focus is on the main characters and the behaviour and motivations of suspects. She uses the backdrop of the domestic life of Inspector Coffin and his actress wife Stella and their little Peke Gus. If you enjoy the company of dogs you might enjoy Dectective Coffin and his fluffy white canine companion who manages to become very dirty at times.<br />This was my first Inspector Coffin mystery and I found it easy to read without having read the earlier books in Butler's series. I'll read others but the series won't go to the top of my list, not because Butler isn't good but because I have so much else to read. I'm still trying to work my way though Dalziel and Pascoe and Janet Evanovich's 1-2-3-4-5-6 series. I bought the hard cover of A GRAVE COFFIN but you might wait and buy the paperback. This is exactly the kind of book to take on a 6-7 hour flight and toss out at the end of your journey..

Hall does not write as well as P.D. James or Colin Dexter, but she gets my vote as one of the top writers in the second tier of English mystery writers. Hall's hero Thackeray does not have the cynical intelligence of Dexter's Morse or the lyrical melancholy of James' Dalgliesh, but as Hall grows older, if she continues to write this series, Thackery has the potential to age like a fine wine. Given Laura Ackroyd's penchant for risking her neck I expect her to be erased long before that happens--or to wise up before she loses credibility with the reader. Laura just never seems to learn. But, good journalists die every day.<br />The strengths of DEAD ON ARRIVAL include a mostly plausible, well developed and tight plot (moves at a reasonable pace with no loose ends); a good sense of place (dozens of apt and colorful metaphors); and a reasonably well developed set of main characters who behave realistically most of the time (albeit immaturely at times). In DOA, Hall adds another dimension to the character of Kevin Mower, thus providing him with needed depth, and the potential to play a stronger role in future novels (especially if Laura is wiped out).<br />The storyline in DOA involves the illegal trafficking of aliens. Hall was very courageous to take on this topic and for the most part she has handled it objectively, though perhaps not as objectively as the poor sods who inforce the immigration laws would like. It's easy to take the side of the individual immigrant (one of my best friends fled Idi Amin and another fled Communist China)  but so hard to see the damage that will eventually result from the unregulated flow of undocumented people.<br />...<br />Hall's story is fairly drawn. Laura is sympathetic and as confused as most folks are. Although it's tempting to have the bad guys always be white racist skinhead thugs (the bad guys used to wear black hats, now they wear white skin!!), Hall makes it clear that people from all backgrounds can be involved in crime and cruel behavior. Laura Ackroyd breaks the social contract (the immigration law) and jeopardizes her life in the process. Thackery loves her, and risks his career to protect her. The resulting mess is predictable. Laura is an idealist with liberal tendancies. God loves liberals but they sure can make a mess.hat people from all backgrounds can be involved in crime and cruel behavior.

Like the wide Sargasso Sea, however, HERBAL contains an accumulation of a little of this and a little of that, but no complete anything. As a result, HERBAL falls into the limbo between the comprehensive text the advanced herbalist seeks and the overview the novice seeks. I suspect Griffin uses this book in her coursework (she teaches) as it is jampacked with the topics one would cover in a survey course. Undoubtedly, she provides additional information in the classroom and I suppose you could use some of the entries in her bibliography to fill out the details.<br />Other reviewers have described HERBAL as an &quot;anthropological&quot; approach to the study of herbs, but I would not. Griffin's approach is geographic--she covers the broad regions of the world. Anthropologists (ethnographers and ethnologists) focus in-depth on one &quot;culture&quot; not an amalgam of five or six groups at a time. An anthropologist would study the contextual use of plants as food, medicine, accessories for adornment, and commodities for exchange. Still, Griffins approach is interesting in a travel guide sort of way.<br />Griffin cites some very good primary sources (her bibliography is useful) including RODALE'S ILLUSTRATED ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HERBS. I prefer Rodale's ENCYCLOPEDIA not only because it provides in-depth information about organic growing practices (whereas Griffin merely brushes over the topic), but it is a good U.S. source of current information on the side effects of herbs (as well as their purported uses). Rodale's book includes the latest medical research concerning specific herbs.<br />Europeans are light years ahead of Americans in herbal research and I have found two books written by European herbalists that are excellent. Penelope Ody's THE COMPLETE MEDICINAL HERBAL (Ody is a member of the National Institute of Medical Herbalists in the U.K) and THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICAL PLANTS by Andrew Chevallier (also a member of the NIMH) are quite good, though the latter is more inclusive (i.e. he includes more plants--herbs, spices, etc.). Lesley Bremness book THE COMPLETE BOOK OF HERBS is a good resource for medical and non-medical uses of herbs though I would be inclined to recommend it more for the latter. All three books are filled with glossy photographs of plants and cost more than Griffin's book.<br />Griffin's book is a good buy for the price if you are unfamiliar with herbs and herbal uses and want to know more. However, if you intend to have more than a cursory knowledge of herbs or use herbs medicinally you will need to invest in more in-depth books and/or study. I've studied, used, and grown herbs for years and I am still very careful, not only about how I use them but how I advise others to use them.

GREAT AMERICAN VEGETARIAN by Nava Atlas isn't the most comprehensive or best vegetarian cookbook I've ever used but it is a good cook book, and a good place to start if you're thinking of taking up the vegetarian lifestyle or you've just been read the riot act by your heart specialist. If you're an ovo-lacto kind of vegetarian, you'll apprectiate it more than if your pure vegan. Many of Atlas' receipes include eggs and cheeses.<br />I find too many of the receipes in VEGETARIAN include peppers (green, yellow, and red) and I am not fond of peppers but if you are then that won't be a negative factor for you. From my perspective, there are not enough receipes with eggplant(2). She has included a number of bean dishes, including a luscious one for Beer-Stewed-Pinto-Beans, which unfortunately for my gastrointestinal problems includes Jalepeno peppers, but I leave out the peppers.  She highlights the squash-bean-maize connection and includes a lovely receipe for patty-pan squash.<br />There are any number of vegetable dishes from the south she might have included, but I suppose they fail the fat test. She includes a coleslaw recipe from North Carolina that must have been imported by a yankee cook after I moved away. The best coleslaw I ever ate was made in North Carolina by my mother-in-law Rachel who served it with barbeque. Rachel's secret ingredient was sugar. If it don't have sugar in it, it ain't Southern.<br />Though Ms. Atlas has made a heroic attempt to compile a cookbook that reflects traditional Southern and other regional dishes, she has included southern recipes that appeal to New England tastes (if they're Southern at all). That's okay if you have New England tastes, but the real taste test for a Southerner is based on the GASS factor -- Grease, Alcohol, Sugar and Salt.  Ms. Atlas has compiled a bunch of healthy recipes. Give me a plate of pinto beans with fatback, collards with fatback, fried okra and cornbread (oh, and add a few slices of sweet onion on the side). Okay, okay, I'm going back on my diet.he side). Okay, okay, I'm going back on my diet.	2001-05-26

THE MEANING OF HERBS is not at all about actually growing herbs. So, if your looking for a gardening book try THE COMPLETE BOOK OF HERBS by Lesley Bremness or RODALE'S ILLUSTRATED ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HERBS.<br />THE MEANING OF HERBS is filled with fun factoids and trivial tales that may or may not be true. For example, &quot;Early herbalists prescribed oregano to those who 'are given to too much sighing' and enraged bears were believed to calm themselves by chewing on oregano bushes.&quot;  This may be, but knowing where bears come from and the origin of oregano, I suspect the bears in question discovered the oregano cure quite by accident in someone's cultivated herb patch (probably right over there in the Great Smokies). And of course, some human must have been around to observe and record the enraged bear as he became becalmed by chewing oregano leaves. (Wonder what enraged him to begin with? Could it be he got into the gardener's bee hive and tried to eat oregano flower honey?).<br />THE MEANING OF HERBS will make a nice party favor, thank-you gift, or a small present for a friend. Filled with somewhat amusing and interesting anectdotes about herbs (and bears) as well as lots of pretty drawings, it's sure to send a warm and positive message.	2001-05-23

THE SWEET LIFE is a short book filled with somewhat profound thoughts Laura Stoddart compiled from famous and not-so-famous sources and beautiful illustrations she apparently drew.  She thanks her father for the words and her mother for the pictures.  Those familiar with A CHILD'S GARDEN OF VERSES might appreciate THE SWEET LIFE as the adult version of a garden of verses.<br />For example, &quot;Who loves a garden, loves a greenhouse too&quot; said William Cowper.  Or, these lines by William Cobbett:<br />&quot;How much better, during a long a dreary winter,  for daughters, and even sons, to assist, or attend,  their mother in the greenhouse, than to be seated  with her at cards, or, in the blubbering over a  stupid novel, or at any other amusement that  can possibly be conceived!&quot;<br />This is the sort of book I like to take with me to the privvy chamber where I meditate daily, or give to others as a little gift from the heart.	2001-05-23

I love PERENNIALS:ENDURING CLASSICS FOR THE CONTEMPORARY GARDEN, by Rob Proctor. Pretty books of this sort are a means to solace  the soul on a dreary day. The photographs by Rob Gray lead me to daydream --first I'm looking at the picture of the garden, then I'm in that garden in my mind. For some, daydreams may be the only way to garden but for those with access to dirt and a little ambition, all things are possible.<br />Recently, various authors have produced a spate of books on antique roses but what about antique perennials? These are the perennials people used to grow, and in some cases still do because they are so tough. While the modern growers offer hybrids of every persuasion, some folks want to restore an older garden, or create a garden with an &quot;older look.&quot; If so, this book is filled with ideas for &quot;antique&quot; gardening -- in plots and in pots.<br />Proctor's book contains an overview of the story of perennials: antique perennials, the written history of flowers, and the history of the perennial gardening style. He then provides a portfolio of antique perennials, laid out A-Z. Each entry covers one or more pages. Various garden shots as well as close-ups of plants, in many cases in floral arrangements (in vases, pots, or other containers, for example Gooseneck Loosestrife in a tuba) are provided.<br />The photographs in the front section show various old-style gardens from garden parterres (literally parted earth) expansions of the French knot gardens of the Middle Ages to fields of flowers such as Goldenrod or Solidago growing in England (introduced from America). Further along the book contains the separate plant listings that range from Acanthus Mollis grown in the Middle Ages and Achillea grown in 19th Century Romantic Gardens to Zantedeschia aethiopia the Calla Lily from Ethiopia.<br />PERENNIALS is not exhaustive, but it does include a solid listing of plants that will work in the &quot;antique&quot; garden.  Having grown all of them at one time or another, I can assure you they will mostly do well in Zone 7 if you &quot;follow the growing instructions&quot; found in the ordinary gardening manual (not PERENNIALS which is more concerned with showing you what might be grown and how it might be grown, not how to grow them).

As much as I admire Janet Marinelli (STALKING THE WILD AMARANTH -- which I highly recommend) and the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, I cannot recommend THE BROOKLYN BOTANIC GARDENER'S DESK REFERENCE as THE reference book for the average gardener.  A much better buy, though half again as much is AMERICA'S GARDEN BOOK, also from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. AMERICA'S GARDEN BOOK is a true reference which lists plants by type, and recommends plants sure to work in the average garden. Actually, AGB is a stunner. I use it all the time and rarely does it lack some kind of answer to my question.<br />DESK REFERENCE is geared to the middle-to-advanced gardener. Different sections of the book deal with ecologically sound gardening practices whether one is dealing with a backyard bog or the desert edge. All gardeners should undertake organic gardening as soon as possible (get rid of your lawn to begin with) as it makes for a better planet and you're less likely to poison yourself, but generally, Rodale's offerings are much more practical and detailed and therefore easier for the novice organic gardener to follow.<br />DESK REFERENCE is printed on pulp paper, contains some drawings but is devoid of photographs.  AMERICA'S GARDENING BOOK is printed on top grade slick paper and loaded with photos. If you can afford both go for it, but if you can afford only one book buy the latter.	2001-05-20

THE GREAT HEDGE OF INDIA by Roy Moxham could have been subtitled 'What I learned about salt, smuggling, tariffs, trade, oppression, taxes and death in India' but it probably wouldn't have sold many copies. Although Moxham set out to uncover the story of a huge hedge the British built from Pakistan across India (along a route almost as long as the southwest U.S./Mexico border) he soon discovered he had a much bigger tale. The real story was the reason for the hedge--to control the movement of taxable commodities especially salt--and the effect of the hedge on the lives of Indians. Moxham says when India's Independence from Britain was declared, Ganhdi was in the midst of a day of silence (he was silent one day a week). He did not speak, but the first thing he wrote on a piece of paper was, &quot;get rid of the salt tax.&quot;<br />Moxham says, unlike sugar, salt is not a luxury. Although those with high blood pressure are warned to limit their salt intake, humans in general cannot survive without salt in their diet. The human body contains about six ounces of salt--salt is critical for the body processes. Every day, the body loses salt it must replace. Failure to replace the lost salt leads to everything from delirium and fainting to death.<br />Creatures who eat mostly vegetarian diets (some humans, cattle, goats, other herbivores) must obtain salt from non-meat sources, via salt licks or by adding salt to their food. As the Hindu diet is vegetarian, these folks are very dependent on acquiring salt from non-meat sources. In addition, Indians live in a hot climate and they and their animals loose a great deal of salt every day through sweat. And Cholera, Malaria, Typhoid, and other fever-diseases endemic in India lead to the additional discharge of body fluids (sweat, vomiting, excretia) and exacerbate salt loss.<br />Moxham says salt taxes are as old as humankind--in fact the word salary comes from the Latin term for payment in salt. Imposing the salt tax on Indians, the British East India company perpetuated a practice carried out by the Moghul princes. However, the BEI enforced the tax so well--including even the poor in their net--they made the lives of many Indians unliveable. In the 1700s and 1800s, BEI officials (and the corrupt politicians they paid off) made huge profits from the salt taxes.  Many of BEI officials returned to England, purchased titles and estates, and some became members of the aristocracy. Many other British who never set foot in India made fortunes from their investments in the company.<br />After the British government took over the rule of India from the BEI it could have dropped the salt tax but did not. Ironically, while millions of Irish were dying as a result of the British authorities mismanagement of the potato famine, millions of Indians were dying owing to a callous disregard by British authorities regarding the salt tax and the inability of the average Indian to pay the tax.<br />Moxham has done a good job of providing a slice of his own life and his own interests in the context of the book. I have only two criticisms--why I cannot give it five stars.<br />First, the context of the tale is missing. I don't think it's fruitful to refer to &quot;British&quot; oppression. While one can become very angry about the salt tax, it's important to remember the context. Only a select few benefitted from the imposition of these taxes. While the British authorities were causing disasters outside Britain, they weren't doing much better inside. Work houses for the poor and the deaths of young women unfortunate enough to find themselves pregnant without the benefit of marriage were the norm in the 19th Century. The shipment of debtors and others who had committed &quot;crimes&quot; to Australia occurred daily. One has only to think of the stories of George Eliot (Adam Bede), Thomas Hardy, the Brontes (Jane Eyre), and Charles Dickens to be reminded that during the 19th Century, life in Britain was difficult for many of it's citizens. The sins of the salt tax lie as they always have, not with the disenfranchised or the working class, but with those who govern them--those in league with commercial interests. The working classes of England had much in common with the poor of India and Ireland--or the U.S. for that matter.<br />My second criticism is less serious--Moxham's book is heavily reliant on a discussion of maps. He even traveled with a GPS (global positioning system) which he used to locate himself on the &quot;map&quot;. He speaks of maps discovered in dusty drawers in various museums and maps referred to in India. Sadly, the only map he provides is a little hand drawn map in the front of the text. I would have liked a drawing at the beginning of every section--a sort of &quot;you are here&quot; map. Owing to my job, I have maps on hand and I could locate most of the various places he describes. If you don't own a map of India, you may find Moxham's book difficult to follow.cult for many of it's citizens.

I would have liked a drawing at the beginning of every section--a sort of &quot;you are here&quot; map. Owing to my job, I have maps on hand and I could locate most of the various places he describes. If you don't own a map of India, you may find Moxham's book difficult to follow.	2001-05-20

The funny thing is, I read about six pages of THE FEAST OF LOVE and put it back on the shelf because I did not like what I read. Then, I almost gave it away without reading it. Then, as these things go, I picked it up again, having forgotten that I had  read the prelude, but this time something compelled me to read on...and on. This is a wonderful, wise, sad, funny, profound, and mystical book.<br />Baxter frames FEAST with his nightly perambulations associated with insommnia. He can't sleep. He says Shakespeare wrote two plays about sleeplessness, 'Macbeth' and 'Midsummernight's Dream'. The first is associated with death and the second with love. He says death and love are first cousins. Baxter dedicated FEAST to his brother who died two years ago.<br />Baxter's nightly wanderings lead him to encounter others who are up and about at night. First he meets his neighbor Bradley who is walking his dog Bradley whom he acquired at the Humane Society Animal Shelter. Bradley took his wife Katheryn to the Animal Shelter (against her will) to help her overcome her fear of dogs. Katheryn has left Bradley for Jenny, but Bradley has the dog Bradley from his visit to the animal shelter. Bradley's second wife Diana (troubled with agoraphobia) leaves him after a less than sucessful honeymoon trip to the woods of upper Michigan fails to cure her of her fear of open spaces.<br />Bradley is the manager of a coffee shop called Jitters where two young lovers named Chloe and Oscar work for Bradley. As Chloe says, she and Oscar are at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder. But, Oscar and Chloe have found true love.  And, they make lots of love, once on the 50-yard line of the stadium at Ann Arbor.<br />Bradley's neighbors Harry and Ester Ginsberg keep two little fish named Ethel and Julius. Harry is a philosophy teacher whose interests are Soren Kierkegaard who (according to Harry) has said &quot;nearly everyone intuits the sublety of God, but no one knows how to speak to him.&quot; Sometimes Harry thinks about Wittgenstein who picked the lint off the suit and lost the suit, or Kaftka and his castles.  Harry and Ester wait for the return of their prodigal son Aron. One cold snowy night they get Chloe instead.<br />Other characters, all associated with each other whirl around this amazing book. Baxter has alluded to the Escher hand drawing the hand (on a tee shirt) which was probably what put me off the book to begin with as it seemed a bit trite, but Baxter is far more subtle than this initial allusion led me to believe. This book touches the most profound mysteries and truths in a way only really good literature can. I laughed out loud and I cried.<br />&quot;Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:  The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,  Hath elsewhere had it's setting...&quot;<br />As Chloe says, this book is about recycled souls.t; Sometimes Harry thinks about Wittgenstein who picked the lint off the suit and lost the suit, or Kaftka and his castles.

This is my first Elizabeth David book, and I intend to read many more. I've been a fan of M.F.K. Fisher for many years and read and enjoyed her books thoroughly. David's writing is somewhat similar--though not as personal--at least AN OMELETTE AND A GLASS OF WINE is not terribly personal. Still, David shares many aspects of her work and travel that allowed me to feel connected to her in a personal way.<br />David was hired to write food/cooking/dining articles for various print media and paid very little initially. Her job involved traveling in France and Italy, visiting various inns and restaurants and markets--which she apparently enjoyed. I started to title my review &quot;born to late&quot; as I would have liked her job. Europe in the 1960s--especially France and Italy must have been wonderful (well my husband says it was and he lived there then). Imagine eating French cooking for a living!! Ah yes, another vicarious reading experience.<br />David tells of her travels to &quot;job&quot; locations--why I think this book is part travelog. Sometimes she has been preceded by Henry James or Marcel Proust, but most often by some obscure person who passed through in the mid-1800s or earlier and recorded their experiences for posterity. David describes the meals she and others have eaten, as well as food preparation (growing, transporting, cooking). Her book includes photographs of a few famous chefs. In most she cases provides information about recipes and lists ingredients--details that might help the reader replicate a dish. She warns the reader it is impossible to replicate a dish exactly owing to many conditions, not the least of which is the quality of the basic ingredients. She finds it amusing when a recipe is touted as being &quot;old&quot; and includes a modern ingredient like margarine.<br />Although many of David's recipes are historical and some ingredients can no longer be had, still I am tempted to try and replicate some of them. My knowledge of cooking has been expanded by what I've read. I now know more than I did about cheeses, mushrooms, wines, and other French foods. This little book is enlightening.<br />I'll store AN OMELETTE AND A GLASS OF WINE with my cookbooks in the kitchen, but it could just as easily be construed as a history/travel book as a cookbook. OMELETTE is filled with anecdotal information about food origins and interesting tidbits. For example, David says the French invented the pizza (it was called pissaladiere) not the Italians. She provides historical evidence Whiskey has been used as a key ingredient in some very upscale dishes. She sets the record straight on Sardines (from the sea near Sardinia) and Syllabub, and the differences between Parmesan and Gruyere--the former Italian and the latter French--but is one really better than the other or are they the same thing?  I love this book and I will refer to it over and over.ng has been expanded by what I've read. I now know more than I did about cheeses, mushrooms, wines, and other French foods.

A FINER END by Deborah Crombie is a &quot;good read&quot; but not nearly as well written as her earlier novel KISSED A SAD GOODBYE. Crombie seems to have fallen into the trap of the &quot;successful&quot; writer who feels compelled to &quot;get out the next novel&quot; to her waiting fans. As a fan who has been waiting, I can appreciate her effort, but this is a sad development because Crombie can write well and has not done so in this novel.<br />As a result of her expedited effort, the plot of A FINER END is thin and contrived, the characters (even the two main characters Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James) are poorly developed, and the text filled with sterotypes and hackneyed expressions. I found A FINER END to be an amalgam of a Susan Allen Toth &quot;thumbprint visit&quot; of Glastonbury, an imitation Cadfael, a warmed over Miss Marple murder and the vicar, and dinner at the heartbreak cafe --in other words, formulaic. I almost expected to find a chapter beginning &quot;It was a dark and stormy night...&quot;<br />Crombie is not English (she lives in a small town in Texas), but she was able to keep her American identity &quot;under wraps&quot; in previous books--perhaps because she concentrated her stories in London which is relatively heterogeneous, somewhat middle-class, relatively democratic, and acculturated by American televison and movies. Her superficial knowledge is exposed in this novel.<br />However, I suppose the thing that irritated me most about A FINER END is Crombie's ethnocentric ignorance of religions -- which wouldn't matter except her book hinges on a New Age-Pagan-Goddess religious connection--all different religious/spiritual practices. When the narrator utters the phrase &quot;not even the Goddess could predict&quot; you know the book is in trouble.<br />There are those who believe the Goddess knows all things, sees all things, etc. just as there are those who believe Allah or God or Jehovah is omniscient, omnipotant etc.  And, Pagans are nature worshippers, not Goddess worshippers. And when did the &quot;Old Ones&quot; come to represent ALL pre-Christian beliefs?  And, do you not think Christianity has it's dark side -- a crucified lord, the inquisition, crusades, the devil!! Crombie has created a mish-mash with which she associates the word &quot;cult&quot; and comes very close to calling human-sacrificers but does not quite because someone had the good sense to keep her from going over the cliff or Tor in this case--or did they?<br />I agree with the other disappointed reviewer. There are a lot of silly loose ends. A little thing that nagged me was why would one fire ceramic tiles without electricity? Yes, I know the artist is making tiles in the old way, using designs and paints from the past, and I know there are ways of heating ovens with firewood/charcoal (we have examples of the process in various historical locations in Virginia) but I do not know a single professional-artist tile-maker--working alone--who makes tiles for a living and does not use electricity.<br />If you must read this book, wait for the paperback or check it out of the library.ature worshippers, not Goddess worshippers.

One critic described A BLIND MAN CAN SEE HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU by Amy Bloom as a non-sentimental look at love.  These stories are non-sentimental, but I want to stress the word 'love' because Amy Bloom writes about love.<br />Once upon a time I taught church school and as part of my teacher training was exposed to the many ways the Greeks defined love. Although we were taught to stress the form of love called 'agape' with our students, I don't recall any discussion of love as unconditional. Agape as I understood it was detached love--the love one tries to have for a neighbor.<br />Later in life, after a few hard knocks I discovered love was not about keeping people at arm's length. My son-in-law died of a heroin overdose. I was upset about the manner of his death and the affect of his living and dying on the lives of my daughter and grandchildren. In spite of all the &quot;bad&quot; things he had done, however, I discovered that I still loved him. One does not love another because of what they do or don't do, one just loves--unconditionally.<br />Amy Bloom writes about unconditional love, which is the only kind of love there really is. Everything else is an illusion. She writes of the love of a stepmother for her stepson and his stepson; the love a lesbian for her married friend dying of cancer--and her love for her friend's husband. She writes of a mother's love for a dead baby and a boy nobody wants. She writes of love involving a physical connection that allows a mistress to help her dying lover. Love is tough and unconditional and it is possible to love more than one person.<br />Bloom's prose is exquisite. He plots are tight and her characters well developed. She not only enables the reader to feel the sorrow and joy each character experiences, she portrays them so lovingly, you will recall many of them long afterward--an amazing feat for short stories.<br />Anyone can be blindsided by love. Love leaves one disarmed and vulnerable, and sometimes it hurts like hell. In the end, it is the reason for living.e hell. In the end, it is the reason for living.	2001-05-11

I went out of my way to track down a copy of &quot;PAUL SCOTT: A Life of the Author of the Raj Quartet&quot; by Hilary Spurling because I have just completed reading the four books Scott called &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot;: JEWEL IN THE CROWN, DAY OF THE SCORPIAN, TOWERS OF SILENCE, DIVISION OF THE SPOILS.  I have also recently purchased the fabulous BBC production available on DVD and I recommend it. Spurling has written an exquisite biography and I found she answered many answers I had about THE masterpiece of the 20th Century (including what happened to some of the key characters).<br />Scott was born in 1920 when England ruled 1/4 of the globe. When WWII broke out, and he was in his early twenties, England conscripted him and sent him to fight the Japanese. He served three years in Southeast Asia, much of that time in India. He returned home after the war and began a writing career that did not florish. As he had an accountant's training, he became a writer's agent--handing the financial arrangements of many authors including Murial Spark who wrote THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE and M.M. Kaye who wrote THE FAR PAVILLIONS (long after he wrote his first book in the Raj Quartet).<br />Scott continued to write in the evenings, but after several mediocre novels, he realized he would never be a first class author unless he took the giant step and quit his job and began writing full time. His novels during this second phase of his career were modestly successful, enough to pay the rent, but not enough to keep the wolf completely away from the door. After writing several less-then-successful books set in India, he decided he needed to travel to India again.<br />He wasn't sure what he would find on his second trip, but once in India he met many individuals, English and Indian, who shared stories of their lives during the last days of the Raj. Inspired by these stories, he returned to England and began to compose the four novels that became the Raj Quartet.<br />Spurling's description of Scott's creative process--how the frustrations of his life, his perseverance in the belief he was supposed to write even after nine failed novels, and his of love of India finally coalesced into a masterpiece--is well-written. I recommend it to anyone who aspires to write.<br />The first book JEWEL IN THE CROWN was published in the mid-60s and set off a storm of controversy. Many of the English were not ready to &quot;visit&quot; the reality of their colonial past. The loss of India was not unlike the &quot;permanently open, stinking, supporating, unhealed wound&quot; of Philoctetes, the Greek archer who killed Paris in the taking of Troy--whose name became Hari Kumar's pseudonym. Scott died in 1978 before the Raj Quartet became an international hit. In the early 1980s the BBC dramatized the stories and the rest is history.<br />This is a fine book. Spurling does not pull any punches and she's done her homework. She used letters, diaries, jounals, personal interviews and many historical documents to compile an excellent story. She apparently admired her subject, but she seems to have written about him honestly.  It may surprise anyone familiar with these stories to know that Scott acknowledged he could be found in all his characters, and like Wilde's Dorian Grey who had a public and a hidden side, Scott was a divided man who discoverd he was both Hari Kumar and Ronald Merrick.g's description of Scott's creative process--how the frustrations of his life, his perseverance in the belief he was supposed to write even after nine failed novels, and his of love of India finally coalesced into a masterpiece--is well-written.

I read THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING by Kundera after I saw the film with Daniel Day-Lewis. I was unimpressed with the book although I recently bought the Criterion DVD of the film mainly because I am a very big DDL fan.<br />I have an occupational tee-shirt that says &quot;Sociologists Get Good Marx&quot; which we do if we study at the &quot;right&quot; university.  Most writers don't get good Marx.  Even most economists have only ever read Das Kapital. What was practiced in Eastern Europe was not Marxism but Leninism gone haywire and Kundera is reacting to this in THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING.<br />Sociologists struggle with something called the &quot;Sociology of Knowledge&quot; -- how do humans think about what they think about; what are the categories of understanding; how do humans frame &quot;reality.&quot; Sociologists enter the realm of regressive thinking about thinking because they want to understand an esoteric process they believe exists--the transmission of culture from one generation to another. As &quot;scientists&quot; they must go one step further and attempt to operationalize and quantify this process (good luck). Think of the Escher print of the hand drawing the hand drawing the hand and you get an idea of this literally mind-blowing activity.<br />If you want to shoot Marxist thinking down as Kundera may have wanted to do, you don't have to throw darts at &quot;progress&quot; which is after all a very Western notion dating from at least the Renaissance.  Rather you can accomplish your goal by identifying the idea of progress--including scientific progress--as a manifestation of &quot;linear thinking&quot; -- cause and effect thinking or teleological plodding.<br />Most of us use linear thinking to survive in &quot;real&quot; life, i.e. if I don't kill the Saber toothed tiger first he'll eat me later. If I don't behave like a capitalist and invest my money wisely now I may starve when I'm older--especially if there are no more left-wingers in the world.<br />Kundera begin his tale with a false premise -- that each human only has one life to live.  A goodly part of the earth's inhabitants believe in Karma and Dharma.  What if they have it right? Buy the film, it's great!!ingers in the world. <br />Kundera begin his tale with a false premise -- that each human only has one life to live.

A DIVISION OF THE SPOILS by Paul Scott is the last book in his series known as the Raj Quartet. The four books are classics, that have been read and will continue to be read centuries from now as readers attempt to understand what happened during the last days of the British Raj in India. I read history but I am also a great fan of well written historical fiction and these books are extremely well written historical fiction. Having read them, I am much more enlightened about the struggles which continue today betweem Hindu and Muslim.<br />Many of the characters from the earlier books converge in DIVISION, and the book introduces a new character, Guy Perron, who is a Chillingborough-Cambridge educated historian whose &quot;period&quot; and place are mid-19th Century India. Guy's character is used to tie up all the loose ends.<br />After arriving in India as a British army sergeant (he has elected not become an officer although his education and class clearly warrent it), Guy has the misfortune to be &quot;chosen&quot; by the recently-promoted-to-LtCol. and very wicked Ronald Merrick as his aide-de-camp. Merrick is still riddled with class envy, and sees in Guy an excellent opportunity to abuse someone he despises. Fortunately, Guy is able to escape from Merrick through the graces of his Aunt Charlotte who pulls strings to have him released from the army.<br />Fortunately for Guy, he doesn't escape Merrick before he meets Sarah Layton. Their story is told in this fourth volume and certain elements of the tale bring to mind the earlier story of Hari Kumar and Daphne Manners. In fact, it is through Guy's meeting of Merrick, Sarah, and another Chillingburrian, Nigel Rowan (who interviewed Hari Kumar in prison) that he becomes interested in the events at Mayapore in 1942 and the subsequent consequences for all involved.<br />As with other great classics, in DIVISION things do not always evolve as the reader would have wished. This book is very realistic -- sorrow and joy are mixed. In JEWEL IN THE CROWN, the first book in the series, Lady Chatterjee says she does not want to go to a heaven that excludes joy and sorrow because being human requires one to feel joy and sorrow.<br />Perhaps it is because humans can experience sorrow they are capable of experiencing joy. In the end, the reader discovers Hari Kumar's fate and the identity of Philoctetes as well as the difference between Dharma and Karma.

TOWERS OF SILENCE by Paul Scott is the third book in the Raj Quartet and continues the story of the last days of British rule in India as told mostly from the perspective of English people living in India during this period. The &quot;towers&quot; of the title are many things including quite literally the place where the dead of a particular Indian relgious sect are laid out and their bodies exposed to carrion who devour them. Metaphorically, the towers may represent the place to which the mentally ill retreat after they witness what they believe to be the death of God.<br />In TOWERS at least two people appear visably &quot;mad&quot; -- Susan Layton and Barbie Bachelor. Others may be equally insane but these two defy established conventions and disrupt the equilibrium of those around them to the point they must be incarcerated.<br />Susan has been made a widow by the death of her new husband. She is pregnant at the beginning of the book and gives birth to Edward shortly after a terrible experience with another death. Afterward she suffers from postpartum depression.<br />Barbie is an ex-missionary--now retired--who has lived with Old Mrs. Mabel Layton for the past five years. Suddenly, Barbie finds herself without a home and with no relatives or close friends. She exhibits behavior deemed odd by the establishment. Barbie also has an uncanny way of pointing to the truth others refuse to acknowledge -- except Sarah Layton.<br />Once again, Sarah reacts very negatively to the obviously bizarre Ronald Merrick whom she visits in a Calcutta hospital in place of her sister who is too ill to travel. Sarah first met Ronald when he served as best man at Susan's wedding. He has since been wounded in a failed attempt to save Susan's husband who died in combat in Maylasia. Merrick provided his spin on the events at Mayapore to Sarah in DAY OF THE SCORPION. Sarah does not believe he tells the truth. In a conversation with Barbie Bachelor, Sarah exclaims regarding the Mayapore incident (first described in JEWEL IN THE CROWN but retold several times from many different perspectives), &quot;Someone should be haunted by it.&quot;  The four books of the Raj Quartet are haunted by the events in Mayapore in August 1942.<br />Barbie Bachelor becomes aware that Sarah has seen the Manners child in Srinigar.

THE DAY OF THE SCORPION continues Paul Scott's very long story (total of 2000 pages) of the last days of British colonial rule in India. SCORPION is book 2 in the so-called Raj Quartet. These books are not about the external events per se as much as they are about the effects of these external events on the lives of several individuals, most prominently, Hari Kumar, Sarah Layton, and later in book 4 Guy Perron. In SCORPION, several new characters are introduced to the series, including members of the Layton and Kasim families.<br />In book 1, JEWEL IN THE CROWN, Hari Kumar was wrongfully jailed by the wicked Ronald Merrick for the rape of Daphne Manners Hari's secret love. When Daphne refused to press charges Hari was detained as a political prisoner. In JEWEL, the story of Hari's life was told from the court proceedings and other second hand accounts.  JEWEL covers a period of about fifty years.<br />In SCORPION, Hari tells the story of his life up to 1942. A large section of this 500 page volume reads like a court proceeding since Hari shares his story with Captain Rowan, who has been ordered by the Governor to interview Kumar in prison.<br />Lady Manners, Daphne aunt, is a secret witness to the interview. It is Lady Manners who has persuaded the British authorities to revisit the reasons for Hari's imprisonment. During the proceedings, Hari is told Daphne is dead. &quot;Twin rivulets gleamed on his prison cheeks, and then the image became blurred and she felt a corresponding wetness on her own...&quot;<br />I think it would be extremely hard to follow this book without having first read JEWEL IN THE CROWN. A large part of SCORPION is used to elaborate and further the plot introduced in JEWEL. Dipping into SCORPION without having first read JEWEL would be like trying to watch a serial after missing a few critical episodes.<br />In addition, the introduction of the Laytons and the Kasims might also seem disjointed unless one knows SCORPION is not a &quot;stand alone&quot; novel. In spite of these limitations, SCORPION is a wonderful book, and thus I have given it 5 stars.<br />In SCORPION, Sarah Layton takes on the central role. Sarah is the only Layton to have had contact with Lady Manners and be concerned about the events in Mayapore. Sarah has two long exchanges with Ronald Merrick, Hari Kumar's nemesis. Sarah meets Captain Rowan Hari's liberator. Sarah is struggling with her own issues surrounding the lives of the English in India. Sarah is the one to watch. And Sarah is an Aries.

Hari Kumar's father made every effort to ensure his son would grow up to become the perfect Anglo-Indian executive. Hari was raised in England and was attended by a governess and later a tutor. He attended Chillingborough a top school known for its production of British Civil Servants. Eventually, Hari was to return to India to work for the Indian Civil Service. Unfortunately, external forces disrupted his life and although he returned to India, it was not in the circumstances his father had planned. THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN is the story of Hari's life.<br />THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN is Book I in the series written by Paul Scott known as the Raj Quartet. JEWEL is a complete novel, but it also lays the groundwork for the three other books in the series. The later books elaborate the story laid out in Book 1. Although Hari is absent from large sections of the text in Books 2-4, he is the main character from the beginning to the end. He is the invisible presence who haunts the other characters. He may symbolize India, but As Daphne Manners says in her journal, he is his own simile.<br />JEWEL takes place in 1942, mostly in India. Hari's story is a composite developed from many viewpoints--court depositions, recorded hearing proceedings, journals, and the personal remembrances of those who him. The narrator piecing the story together appears to be a writer or reporter describing the so-called Mayapore riots of 1942 and their aftermath in the years following. Pandit Baba, an Indian scholar, says in a Book 2 that the word &quot;riot&quot; is a misnomer. The English say it was a riot but the Indians say it was a lawful protest by a people who had suffered outrage and wanted Independance.<br />The Raj Quartet reminds me of Jane Austin's novels --especially her later books MANSFIELD PARK and EMMA. Like Austin, Scott has a keen understanding of human nature. His characterizations of Harry and Daphne are flawless. He builds them one fine layer at a time until the reader is convinced they must have been &quot;real&quot; people. Scott also describes an historical place and the people who lived in it with what the reader can only believe is verismilitude. Like Austin, Scott brings an exquisite sense of timing to his storyline. The near misses and plot twists leave the reader breathless. And,like Austin, Scott's sense of irony is so deftly incorporated one can only wonder at the various possible interpretations of the text.<br />JEWEL like India is difficult to understand. Scott has written his book in English, and as Hari Kumar's father said, English is a beautiful language but &quot;it cannot be called truthful because its subtleties are infinite. It is the language of a people who have probably earned their reputation for perfidy.&quot;ed they must have been &quot;real&quot; people.

Mary McCarthy's VENICE OBSERVED is neither history nor a guide book but rather a literary reflection written by a young 1950s &quot;single&quot; woman who has visited a beautiful place and now sits at her desk and muses over what she has seen.<br />McCarthy was a writer and an educated woman in an age when educated women were few. She probably wore white gloves and a little hat and visited Europe after graduation from college. One can picture the author of THE GROUP traveling abroad, continuing her education. As part of her formal training, she read James and Ruskin and then she visited the sights they described and wrote her own impressions. I found McCarthy's book intriguing because she was intriguing and women like her don't exist any more. I picture her looking a bit like Katherine Hepburn arriving in Italy in &quot;Summertime.&quot;  Maybe McCarthy wasn't a &quot;career girl&quot; as single women sans husband and children who worked for a living were called in those days, but this is how I picture her on reading VENICE OBSERVED.<br />I've just finished reading JJ Norwich's HISTORY OF VENICE and if you want history Norwich's book is the definitive history. VENICE OBSERVED is for women who want a bit of information to complement their education mixed in with another woman's reflections. VENICE OBSERVED is for educated women who travel alone.<br />McCarthy includes some history, but only as a backdrop to her real interests which are art and literature.  She assumes you know who Tintoretto and Titian were and that you've at least seen pictures of their works. Where Norwich mentions Tintoretto in passing (Norwich is more interested in archtecture) McCarthy dwells on him.<br />VENICE OBSERVED is not an art book however. McCarthy's writing reminds me of James or Ruskin, both of whom she quotes. They observed various places, buildings, paintings, etc. but always assumed you had some prior knowledge of the thing they were discussing.  VENICE OBSERVED is the sort of book you'd want to read after you have made your own visit to Venice.  You could read it before hand, but the text would be overwhelming if you come to it with no prior knowledge. If you want to read a more contemporary book, I recommend ITALIAN DAYS by Barbara Grizutti Harrison.ook you'd want to read after you have made your own visit to Venice.

TRILOBITE is for those who love prehistory and paleontology but don't want to read big fusty tomes written by obtuse learned men (and women). I suppose most folks younger than me came across trilobites in grade school, my daughter certainly did. I first discovered them when she was in fourth grade and had an assignment on the little creatures. Actually, I thought they were little until I read Fortey's book and discovered there were hundreds of species ranging from gnat-sized to stingray sized.<br />My daughter's class had a field trip to the Smithsonian, and it was there I became overwhelmed by trilobites. I will never forget the shock of walking into that museum the first time and seeing the story of evolution laid out and the exhibits of the Cambrian, Silurian, and other eras. Why the shock?  Because I grew up in the South, and having had &quot;Bible Study&quot; in place of science, I had no idea evolution existed. The trilobite was my  introduction to the story of evolution. Well, that was many years ago, and now I have years of education behind me (I went back to school) but still I love to read about trilobites.<br />Fortey apparently has a background in geology and I found his discussions of land forms quite interesting. It's amazing to think the Appalacian chain which extends from Canada to Geogia was created millions of years ago and that part of this mountain range may be found in Europe. He explains how the fossil record (especially the part containing trilobites) can be used to link the world's surface areas. For example, by matching the various fossils (trilobite species), paleontologists have been able to link Newfoundland with the North Sea.<br />Fortey discusses a reformulation in the theory of evolution that somewhat abandons the notion of &quot;progress&quot; and replaces it with the notion of &quot;punctuated equilibrium.&quot; Creatures evolve but it isn't always &quot;forward&quot; as some scientists once thought. They sometimes adapt to hostile conditions and in the process lose a former trait. For example, while most trilobites seem to have had eyes, blind species apparently evolved from sighted ones. Fortey says he has almost given up hope of finding a living trilobite in an abyss in the ocean, but the horseshoe crab and scorpions and other arthropods may be the related to the fossil trilobites. If so, the trilobites have not become extinct, just adapted to new circumstances.<br />The only misgiving I have about Fortey's book is that he does persist in calling the Middle Ages the Dark Ages. Historians now know that a great deal of &quot;science&quot; occurred during the Middle Ages and although practices such as autopsies might have been disapproved by church leaders, their disapproval was no more invasive than government intervention today in areas involving stem cell research, fertility issues, cloning, and AIDS. In every era there have been ethical issues that lead people to take differing positions. Fortey is apparently 100 percent for science which is his perogative.conditions and in the process lose a former trait.

Norwich's A HISTORY OF VENICE a guidebook I would give it one star for effort.  This is a history, and history buffs will love it. Someone enroute to Venice for a vacation might do better to pick up Steve Ricks latest book. (Besides, the book is heavy--even in paperback--and not designed to carry along in your suitcase). I bought the paperback, and I liked the book so much I went searching for a hard cover for my permanent library.<br />I have studied the thousand or so years of European history from 800 to 1800 via one reading experience or another (including Norwich's books on Byzantium) and the &quot;value-added&quot; of this book is that Norwich organizes the history of this period from a new perspective--that of the secular outsider Venice. Norwich either omits or downplays events I usually consider important milestones in European history. Againcourt is not mentioned, the sacking of Rome in 1525 receives two lines, and Henry the VIII is the son-in-law of the Spanish king.<br />On the other hand, Norwich describes the various military and/or trading alliances that included or excluded Venice (such as the disasterous League of Cambrai), and offers a new viewpoint on the Crusades. Venice had a ring-side seat since she served as a jumping off point to the Levant and her old Doge actually led the fourth crusade which mortally wounded Byzantium.<br />Venice mostly attempted to remain neutral when the European powers were engaged in internal fighting over religious or boundary issues. Even though a part of Europe, she was much more oriented toward the Mediterranean, Byzantium, and the Levant.<br />When the infidel Ottoman Turks invaded and captured various Christian areas, Venice carried the brunt of fighting alone. Using the Venitian perspective Norwich illuminates the cost of continued and endless European internal conflict. Europe ignored the infidel until it was almost too late. There were critical junctures over time when the steady advances of Islam might have been stopped before it overran Eastern Europe and created trouble spots that still exist today.<br />Norwich loves Venice, and is biased towards his love.  As a good Englishman, he barely contains his dislike of Napoleon, the Ottoman Turks, and the various popes who &quot;led&quot; the church over the millenium--many of whom attacked Venice. I agree with Norwich, the Turks were absolute barbarians in spite of their perfumed bodies, but the sacking of Rome by Charles was not an act of kindness either.<br />Certainly Napoleon was not always on his best behavior, but I'm American and we sided with Napoleon and had our White House burned for the effort. Never mind, that's the fun of history, always trying to see the other fellow's point of view and I agree with Norwich, I wish Napoleon had left Venice alone and not exported his revolution to the old city.es of Islam might have been stopped before it overran Eastern Europe and created trouble spots that still exist today.  <br />Norwich loves Venice, and is biased towards his love.

There are so many gardening books on the market why should you care about this one?  Well, for one thing the author Stephen Lacey is a distinguished British garden expert involved with the preservation of all those lovely gardens you like to visit when you go to the U.K. Lacey, not to be confused with Allen Lacy his garden buddy in New Jersey, is also the author of THE STARTLING JUNGLE a very good book on building the appealing and different personal space.<br />In SCENT IN YOUR GARDEN, Lacey continues with his discussion about adding elements to the garden that pleasantly stimulate the five senses.  In SCENT he list many plants (photos and text descriptions) including trees, shrubs, bulbs, perennials, and of course Roses that fill the air with perfume.<br />One might not think of planting a tree for its scent, but I can attest to the wonderful perfume of the Persian or English Walnut tree--and the nuts are tasty too.  Of course Lacey includes those plants many of us already know, Nicotiana, Hyacynths, and Lonicera (honeysuckle) but he also tells the reader certain species of tulips, daffodils, Paeonias, Viburnum, and herbs have their charms.<br />Lacey includes a section on herbs. He says herbs can be grown in herb gardens, but culinary herbs in particular are quite a treat grown in pots by the back door--Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, Thyme--provided there is enough sun. So you have the double pleasure of smelling the herbs through the screen door or window, and enjoying their aroma served up in your favorite dish. Some species of butterflies are particularly fond of Parsley so you'll have some pretty sights too (they lay their eggs which then pupate and eat it!!).<br />Lacey's book does not discuss growing techniques in any great detail, but it probably wouldn't matter anyway since what works for a plant in England often does not work in the U.S.  I live in Zone 7, however, and I most of these plants will work in my growing zone.  The roses are tricky--what works in the mild English sun often croaks in the hot Virginia sun--but he lists two roses I am growing for their scent--Comte de Chabord and Blanc Double de Courbet. I have also been able to get some roses to grow in Virginia Lacey does not list such as the lovely clove scented climber Polka.<br />I recommend this book to anyone trying to bring a little perfume (day or night) into their surroundings. Scented plants can be grown anywhere and from my perspective, the sense of smell is just as important as the sense of sight in the garden.ks in the mild English sun often croaks in the hot Virginia sun--but he lists two roses I am growing for their scent--Comte de Chabord and Blanc Double de Courbet.

THE NATURAL SHADE GARDENER by Ken Druse is a beautiful book even if the photos are slightly &quot;touched up.&quot;  I have to laugh at the oxymoronic title, however. There is nothing natural about shade gardening, and this is not the WILD GARDEN William Robinson wrote about where drifts of plants are allowed to form naturally. I can tell from Druse's photos someone has been working very hard. Nature's version of vegetation in shade is quite different. Plants in nature tend to run to riot. If you don't think so, take a walk in the &quot;real&quot; woods. In nature, the toughest plant wins.<br />For example, Druse says English Ivy is a good ground cover in shade. Well, it is.  English Ivy will grow in shade---and grow and grow and grow. Recently, a group of local volunteers in our area pulled English Ivy from the trees in a local nature preserve. The stuff kills. Another vine Druse recommends without a warning is Porcelain-berry which is becoming a major problem in along the east coast. Are you old enough to remember the introduction of the new wonder vine Kudzu??<br />On the other hand, Druse says Tradescantia, a native of Virginia brought to England where it was hybridized at Kew Gardens is a pest. Well, it is a prolific plant if you reintroduce it in a Zone 7 garden, but it can be controlled without a great deal of effort, unlike Lysimachia clethroides (White Gooseneck Loosestrife) which Druse recommends without warning that it will take over if you invite it into your garden. Allen Lacey and other garden writers have ID'd Gooseneck Loosestrife as a &quot;thug in the garden&quot; and I can tell you from personal experience they are absolutely correct (of course I had to find out for myself!!).<br />I tend to agree with the reviewer from Maplewood NJ below who says THE NATURAL SHADE GARDEN by Ken Druse is not for the beginner. This book is for advanced gardeners who can &quot;take what they need and leave the rest.&quot; Shade gardening is something you take up after you've mastered other less complicated types of gardening. Of course, if you're stuck with shade you'll have to start somewhere.<br />I have been using George Shenk's book THE COMPLETE SHADE GARDENER for years. It's not as colorful, and contains those annotated lists of plants which some do not like, however, Shenk's plant classifications are not exhaustive so you won't be overwhelmed, and the trees, shrubs, etc. are classified by their behavior--i.e. what will work in which circumstances. Like many gardeners I once planted a Maple tree in my yard. Shenk's book contains a listing of shade trees and from it I discovered Maple trees are shallow rooted and not at all friendly toward other plants.  I also discovered the Black Walnut can be a killer. In the nick of time had the Maple tree removed and planted a Persian Walnut instead. I've been able to grow Crepe Myrtles, Viburnums, Nandina, and a host of other plants under the Walnut, though I sometimes have to water in August. Some of us don't want to end our gardening experience in order to have a shady patio in July.after you've mastered other less complicated types of gardening.

For over 20 years, Penelope Hobhouse has been building a garden at Tintinhull in England. Hobhouse's philosophy is that one never exhausts the possibilities. Each site has infinite strengths and weaknesses, and those can change and be changed. In addition, plants have their own natures which react differently in different settings. She says a plant in a garden on the Isle of Oronsay, an oasis in the midst of a vast landscape swept by salt-laden winds has a very different experience from one grown in a garden in Michigan or her own garden at Tintinhull.<br />In her book ON GARDENING, Hobhouse gives you the gardener's tour. You are able to see both the artist's views and the artist at work behind the scenes (Hobhouse in dungarees). The reader is provided an overview of the grounds at Tintinhull in a map, and then each part of the grounds is explored separately: the Fountain Garden, the Middle Garden, the Pool Garden (no, not a swimming pool), the Kitchen Garden, the Cedar Court and the Eagle Court.<br />For example in the section on the Eagle Court (so named because it contains a nice weathered statue of an eagle with lichens growing on his shoulders), the reader is shown composite pictures of the groups of plants one might view on entering the garden. For example one photo shows mauve and lavender Aubitilons, blue Ceanothus, Euphorbias and Clematis.  Next, Hobhouse provides the layout for the plants in the Court--the center is grass and it is bounded all the way around by borders.  A lovely colored chart has been drawn around the edges of two pages and samples of the plants in the Court are provided in photos inset in the center. This lovely layout allows the reader to following the design and view the elements of the design and one fell swoop.<br />In other sections of the book, Hobhouse repeats her approach, showing the composite shots and then the designs and plant specimins. The photos of the invidual plants are drop-dead gorgeous. Probably the most stunning example is one shot taken of the old Cedar of Lebanon which dominates the grounds.  Probably the nicest aspects of the book is the sight of Penelope Hobhouse in garden togs including wellies and padded jacket working in the garden, propagating plants (barehanded), sorting seeds, and pruning roses. She seems to thoroughly enjoy the hard work, and although she maintains some staff to help her, she is a real hands-on gardener.example is one shot taken of the old Cedar of Lebanon which dominates the grounds.

Penelope Hobhouse edited THE GARDENS OF EUROPE and her name alone should encourage the reader to pursue this book through the Z-shops since apparently it is out of print. Hobhouse is considered by many to be one of the world's foremost garden experts and her contribution to the book is undoubtedly the selection. Penelope won't send you to a garden not worth seeing.<br />The stated purpose of the book according to Hobhouse is to introduce the reader to the most important gardens in Europe and to provide a representative picture of the distinctive horticultural traditions of the countries included. The gardens Hobhouse includes are open to the public, but in some cases arrangements must be made ahead of time if you intend to visit them. Hobhouse lists several of my favorites, including Sissinghurst and the University Botanical Gardens at Oxford. I've spent many a happy moment sitting on a bench in the botanical gardens. Some days you can look across the Thames (which is very narrow here) and see a Cricket match.<br />Although the book is about 10 years old and some of the information is dated (admission charges), it lists 700 gardens open to the public in both Western and Eastern Europe. At the time of it's printing, many of those in Eastern Europe had just opened to Westerners. Undoubtedly, you will want to verify a garden of interest to you is still open to the public.<br />The book is filled with color as well as black and white photos, and useful maps. You won't want to carry the book on your trip as it's heavy, but if you're looking for more information about a particular area or garden you can use this book to supplement the information in your Blue Book, Michelin Guide or Baedecker.	2001-04-08

I had some difficulty locating this book and ended up buying a copy of IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER from Alibris. The DEAD OF WINTER is the U.S. title of the book sold in the Britain as IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER and the two books are 99% alike. My understanding is that the U.S. editors change words, phrases, etc. they think Americans won't understand, which is silly because one of the reasons many Americans read British mysteries is because they LIKE the Brits and want to learn more about them. For example, would you understand &quot;the labors of Causabon&quot;?  Hint--has to do with MIDDLEMARCH.<br />Patricia Hall has been developing a lovely series about her two protagonists Michael Thackerey and Laura Ackroyd and this is the 3rd or 4th book in the series. If you're following the Thackery-Ackroyd relationship, you will want to read this book since it provides insight into Thackery's struggles with his past. I know a man like Thackery, dealing with the death of his child, and I have to believe that Hall must also. In addition, Thackery is what some call a &quot;fallen-away Catholic&quot; and being in that category myself, I understand some of his angst.<br />Hall also has a political message--though her main characters are relatively neutral given their professions of news reporter and cop--and since I am of the liberal persuasion and agree with her message, I enjoy her books. Social conservatives won't like her books. A few of us Anglophiles are also of a socialist leaning however, and for us she is pure gold. What sort of people can deny the poor health care!!!<br />In the DEAD OF WINTER/IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER a number of folks need health care.  There's plenty of murder and mayhem including angry parents who stage protest rallies to block eco-bashing trucks from destroying the peace and quiet and safety of a small village. There's not a lot of humour in this book but I love the names of the greedy corporate types--Cheetam and Moore.<br />This is a great book. Find it and read it.and read it.	2001-04-08

The late Henry Mitchell, noted garden columnist for the Washington Post, said every gardener should own a few classic garden books and he included William Robinson's books on his short list. He frequently cited Robinson, and but for Mitchell, or Elizabeth Lawrence who referred to him from time to time, I am not sure I would have ever discovered Robinson. After all, what can an old guy writing in the last century possibly have to say that I would find useful, relevant or even interesting?  Well, as it turns out quite a lot.<br />Gravetye Manor is located in the southern part of England, in East Grinstead, Sussex. William Robinson once owned the estate and he built the gardens surrounding the house. He wrote several books about his work at Gravetye, including THE WILD GARDEN first published in 1870. In THE WILD GARDEN, Robinson describes how he developed a new kind of garden in the woods.<br />The woods around Gravetye Manor are not the forest primeval, they are a coppice used for ages as a source of firewood, fencing, etc. That's important because most understory plants need some sunlight and the wild forest provides little light. In a coppice, filtered sunlight makes it's way to the ground. Every now and then there's an open space where a dead tree fell or was felled and the sun shines in these openings for longer periods. Generally, the coppice floor is free of debris since fallen limbs are collected for firewood.  It is in this setting one can build a &quot;wild garden.&quot;<br />The wild garden is filled with interesting plants year round. In the winter, low shrubs of holly, plants of Hellebores, Winter Aconite, and creeping mosses and ferns make a showing. In spring hundreds of different bulbs spring forth. It may seem like a cliche today, but Robinson is the fellow who &quot;invented&quot; the bluebell dell. Before he devised his romantic bulb gardens in the woods no one thought gardens should be anywhere but in backyards--even if they were several acres of grass and trees.<br />Robinson is the father of romantic gardening. His most famous pupil was the landscape garden artist Gertrude Jekyll, doyenne of the landed classes in the Edwardian period who developed her grounds at Munstead Woods based on his theory--the cottage gardener was onto something wild and wonderful. His influence was felt on both sides of the Atlantic. His theories were adapted and promoted by Frederick Law Olmsted (Biltmore Estate NC), Carl Vaux (The Rambles in Central Park in NYC), Beatrix Ferrand (Dumbarton Oaks DC).<br />Even though the book was written for the British gardener Robinson's approach is applicable on both sides of the Atlantic. I particularly recommend this book to anyone with a home built on a 1/4 or 1/2 acre lot in the middle of former farmland (the typical suburban dwelling). You can add trees and bushes and underplant with bulbs and other shade loving plants and you'll end up with more wildlife than ever existed when the land was used for farming.<br />The plant references in THE WILD GARDEN are current, and Graham Stuart Thomas has provided an appendix of botanical revisions for those that have changed. The book contains no photos, but the engravings used for illustration are beautiful.grass and trees.  <br />Robinson is the father of romantic gardening.

His theories were adapted and promoted by Frederick Law Olmsted (Biltmore Estate NC), Carl Vaux (The Rambles in Central Park in NYC), Beatrix Ferrand (Dumbarton Oaks DC).<br />Even though the book was written for the British gardener Robinson's approach is applicable on both sides of the Atlantic. I particularly recommend this book to anyone with a home built on a 1/4 or 1/2 acre lot in the middle of former farmland (the typical suburban dwelling). You can add trees and bushes and underplant with bulbs and other shade loving plants and you'll end up with more wildlife than ever existed when the land was used for farming. <br />The plant references in THE WILD GARDEN are current, and Graham Stuart Thomas has provided an appendix of botanical revisions for those that have changed. The book contains no photos, but the engravings used for illustration are beautiful.	2001-04-08

Stephen Lacey is a British gardener and not to be confused with Allen Lacy the prolific American garden writer who gardens and writes in New Jersey. Allen Lacy wrote the introduction to Stephen Lacey's book THE STARTLING GARDEN.<br />Stephen Lacey takes the title of his book from Vita Sackville West, who wrote in 'The Garden' &quot;Follow my steps, oh gardener, down these woods. Luxuriate in this my startling jungle.&quot;<br />Lacey's book is a wonderful treatise on the relationship between the senses of sight and smell and the garden. For Lacey, the object of gardening is to engage and hold the senses through the use of startling elements. Perhaps you recall the English poet Alexander Pope suggested the use of elements of &quot;surprise&quot; in the formal garden--a statue placed in an opening you chance upon in a walk down a garden path?  Well, Pope was writing about formal gardens, and Lacey is taking this as a starting point, but Lacey is writing about leaving the straight and narrow path of the formal garden and following the teachings of the romantic gardeners like Gertrude Jeckyll and Vita de Sackville West. In their gardens less attention was paid to architecture and shape, and more attention was paid to the effect of the garden on the senses. Sackville-West built the garden at Sissinghurst. I can recall one October strolling through the garden when most of the plants had been killed back by the frost. Every now and then I would stumble on a patch of not yet frostbitten flowers, and be &quot;startled.&quot; One section in particular took my breath away.  Just off the path in a niche of garden wall stood several large rose buses.  All that remained of their summer glory were exceeding large red rose hips. Mixed in with the hips were Asters, just as tall as the rose bushes. The Asters were still covered with hundreds of small lavender-purple flowers that juxtaposed with the hips created a &quot;startling&quot; effect.<br />Lacey says the use of startling elements is not to be confused with gaudy. If it were physically possible to plant a magenta Bougainvilla and a bright yellow Alamanda so they would intertwine and grow over a Hampshire rectory, you still wouldn't want to do it. On the other hand, a walkway consisting of overhanging bright yellow Laburnum blossoms underplanted with orange wallflowers is a magnificent thing. Why are these two combinations so different in their effect?  One shocks and the other startles. Lacey says it has to do with the use of color. Some colors when combined can overwhelm the sense of sight while others stimulate without overpowering.<br />Lacey also discusses the use of scent as a &quot;startling&quot; element. His garden year culminates in June-July when the roses are at their peak in England. Though the growing seasons are different in the states, the effects he describes can be achieved albeit at different times of the year depending on your growing zone.  In my area (Zone 7) the peak for roses is usually May-early June, though I can have other peaks later in the summer with  flowers such as Lavender and summer annuals like Petunias.<br />I have found many useful ideas in the STARLING JUNGLE and highly recommend this book to any gardener who is ready to break out of the mold. Garden lovers who cannot garden but wish to better appreiciate the art when they visit other's gardens will also enjoy his book.

I read VIRGINIA WOLFE: A BIOGRAPHY by Quentin Bell after I had read several other books about Wolfe. I was pleased to discover that Bell included some of the more unsavory aspects of Woolfe's life even though he was a blood relative and wrote his book in an age that frowned on revealing &quot;dirty&quot; family secrets. I am referring to the presumed incestuous behavior of Woolfe's brothers towards Virginia and Vanessa.<br />Quentin Bell was the son of Virginia's sister the artist Venessa Bell. Virginia and Vanessa were the daughters of the very prominent English Victorian Leslie Stephen. Stephen married Virginia's mother Julia after her first husband Herbert Duckworth died. The brothers accused of incest were sons from the first marriage and much older than Virginia who was the next to the youngest child of Julia and Leslie.<br />Much has been written about the end of Virgina's life, how she placed several heavy stones in her pockets and walked into the river Ouse near her home and drowned herself in the early 1940s. As recently as last week on Garrison Keilior's &quot;Writer's Almanack&quot; on NPR on the anniversary of her birth this event was mentioned again as if it was the only thing she ever did of interest.<br />But Virginia did not take her life easily.  She had survived some horrific events including the death of her beloved brother Thoby--her closest sibling, and the deaths of many other loved persons during WWI, as well as the death of Lytton Strachey her best friend. Moreover, at the time of her death, her London home in Bloomsbury had been bombed and Hitler was threatening to invade England. Virginia's husband Leonard was Jewish and they were both aware of what Hitler was doing to the Jews.<br />The most wonderful aspect of Bell's book is that he tells the complete story of Virgina's life--how she coped with sorrow and  used her life experiences to frame her art. She was probably the most original writer of the 20th Century, and much of the glory that went to James Joyce should have gone to her. At the very least, she was his equal.  She wrote in a 'stream of consciousness subjective voice' before James, but she wrote in an era when women writers found it difficult to become published. In fact, Virginia and Leonard started their own publishing press to deal with this deficiency. Even so, Virginia's work remained relatively obscure until it was &quot;discovered&quot; during the women's movement of the 1960's.<br />This is an illuminating, sad, and reflective book written by a man who knew and loved her.

Rosemary Verey is the doyenne of English gardeners and as such can teach any gardener something. Although American gardeners must proceed cautiously when trying to replicate English garden ideas--owing to differing moisture conditions, the chalk base under British beds, and latitude/longitude considerations, i.e. the effects of the sun--THE ART OF PLANTING contains much to recommend it.<br />For example, Verey shows us Mrs Pugh's bog garden at Docton Mill in Devon. Devon has a climate comparable to Zones 7 &amp; 8 in the U.S. but the sun does not get nearly as hot in the summer months in Devon as it does in most Zone 7 &amp; 8 U.S. areas.  Devon is further north and it is warmed by the Gulf Stream like New England.<br />Mrs. Pugh grows Iris, ferns and Hosta lillies in her garden. Her ferns include the osrich plume fern 'Osmunda Regalis' which grows wild in the eastern U.S.--I have found them in drainage ditches but you can buy them at a good nursery. Mrs. Pugh also grows Iris pallida. I have been able to grow a similar plant in Virginia--Iris siberica which requires both dampness and sun. Most Hosta lillies would not last in the same garden as the Iris or the fern, however. Hostas mostly prefer shade like the ferns, but they also like dry conditions. In fact, they are a mainstay in my shade gardens.  If you try to replicate Mrs. Pugh's garden, you may have to improvise with plants that like both the U.S. sun and dampness.<br />In addition to the wide array of growing conditions, Verey discusses the use of color, shape and texture in planting. She says, &quot;Some plants need shining leaves to set them off, particularly...white flowers with green centers. Other, like potentillas merge with their foliage.&quot;  In other words, consider not only the juxtapostion of flower color and size but the neighborliness of leaves. In one photo shows the iceberg rose 'Schneewitchen' growing in a bed of 'Stachys' or lamb's ears. The glossy green leaves of the rose contrast nicely with the soft green fuzzy leaves of the Stachys and the large white flowers of the rose blend beautifully with the contrasting green leaves.<br />There are several sets of photos and text discussing the use of monochromatic color schemes.  The most famous example of the white scheme is the White Garden at Sissinghurst, but Verey shows the reader Anne Dexter's tiny Oxford garden where a white hydrangea stands next to a hidden door. Another monochromatic scheme might be purple, using Campanula persicifolia and Stachys byzantina, and blue pansies and hyacinths.<br />The U.S. gardener might not be able to copy the designs Verey shows exactly because blooming times for plants vary from place to place. Verey's color schemes could be executed with local plants, however. The easiest way to discover what might work is to take a trip to the local nursery and pick out plants blooming close to the same time. Ask the nursery staff if the plants came from a hothouse, because sometimes plants bloom out of season owing to sheltered conditions. This is less of a problem during the warmer months. Our local nursery divides the shade loving plants from the sunny border plants which is a big help.<br />This wouldn't be an English gardening book without a discussion of borders, and Verey doesn't fail to supply the requisite text and photos. Again, some of the ideas cannot be executed in the U.S. in the exact detail shown, but there are many possible exceptions. For example, she shows Perovskia growing behind Viola cornuta which will work in some areas in zone 6 and 7.  Hoever, the Viola may burn up under some condtions.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who loves beautiful garden photographs, and/or is searching for garden design ideas. Although you may not be able to replicate the gardens shown in every detail, you will find Verey's suggestions useful if you live in growing zones 6-8.ly with the soft green fuzzy leaves of the Stachys and the large white flowers of the rose blend beautifully with the contrasting green leaves.<br />There are several sets of photos and text discussing the use of monochromatic color schemes.

When I bought LIVING IN SMALL SPACES by Lorrie Mack I thought I would discover clever ways to store &quot;stuff&quot; in small spaces.  The cover says Mack is a journalist and stylist, but she must  be a designer too, or know one since LIVING is a design book.  Anyone interested in developing these ideas better be prepared to lay out cash and/or engage in hard work.<br />For example, Mack shows a clever way to add storage in an antique armoire by installing hanging wire baskets on the undersides of the shelves. Assuming you want to make permanent holes in the shelves of a very old piece, you will have to purchase the hardware (probably not terribly expensive, but finding wire baskets that exactly fit the undersides of the shelves in your piece may be time-consuming) and drill holes for the hardware while standing on your head if the shelves are fixed.<br />The book contains a number of beautiful illustrations of out-of-the-ordinary kitchens designed around very esoteric architectural elements. Some of the kitchens are located in older housing where oddball elements are the norm. Other kitchens have been specially built in newer housing or heavily renovated housing. There are shelves over the stoves and up the walls behind the sink or under the sink when a window has been installed the full length of the wall behind the sink.<br />Oddly, there are some scenes in this mostly photo-journal that seem to come from large ornate homes.  Picture the secret pantry for glassware hidden on either side of a bowed-Palladian window looking out on what can only be described as a garden at the Cloisters in NYC. The room is round, and the walls consist of a series of cupboards hidden in the paneling.<br />Mack shares ideas galore for lightening a room. Knock a hole in the roof and create a skylight where before only a low ceiling hang. Or better yet, take out the entire apex of the roof of a long narrow hall and turn it into a workshop or office with natural lighting. Knocking holes in the roof and walls does not help with storage, but it sure lets the light in.<br />One section of the book is dedicated to living in one room. Mack shares a number of ideas for dividing a room into separate spaces to create the sensation of multiple rooms. These single rooms divided into many spaces are tastefully decorated with a designer's expensive touch.<br />This is a beautiful book and if you're clever you can probably find ways to copy some of the ideas without breaking the bank. I think the biggest contribution the book makes is to &quot;free up&quot; one's thinking about how things &quot;ought&quot; to look.es in the roof and walls does not help with storage, but it sure lets the light in.<br />One section of the book is dedicated to living in one room.

I bought THE GARDEN BORDER BOOK by Mary Keen a few years ago, and although she is a British writer and many of the photographs taken by Gemma Nesbitt were snapped in England, the book contains many useful ideas if you're about to embark on the design of a border garden or ready to tear out the old border and start again. This is a book of designs--plant maps as well as photos--but you don't have to have five acres to create a border. Keen's book contains designs for short borders, long ornate borders, and corner pockets--which could fit in a townhouse sized garden. In fact, all the long border designs could be divided into small beds.<br />When I first started building garden beds at my current residence (I have a small lot), I spent hours reading garden books, looking at photos and trying to imagine how various plants would behave in my growing zone (7). I suffered many disappointments along the way but many successes too. There is no teacher like experience, but Mary Keen's book provides some practical ideas--along with beautiful photos of other people's successes.<br />With a few exceptions, Keen's garden designs translate well in Zone 7.  For example, in one bed Keen has placed Sedum 'Autumn Joy', Berberii's Thunbergii, Achilla 'Moonshine', Penstamon 'Garnet' Potentilla arbuscuia, Scabiosa remelica and Lavandula Dutch, in the first row. Behind them she has placed Asters, roses, and Nepeta, and behind this she has placed climbing vines (Clematis) and small trees and bushes.  This plan will work in growing Zone 7 in a raised bed, I've tried it. I had to substitute some of the plants (roses) and some varieties because I could not find them--but the differences between varieties of a species are minor. All of these plants are heat and drought resistant, and mostly not prone to powderly mildew, the curse of Zone 7.<br />I recommend Keen's book to anyone looking for good design ideas, but especially for those working in growing zone 7. I think the designs could be reworked slightly to make nice gardens in zones 6 (you might lose some plants to frost) and 8 (you might lose some plants like the heat).  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.reworked slightly to make nice gardens in zones 6 (you might lose some plants to frost) and 8 (you might lose some plants like the heat).

According to the dust jacket, THE ABYSSINIAN by Jean-Christophe Rufin is a first novel. If so, I hope Rufin writes many more books because THE ABYSSINIAN is one of the best works of fiction I've read in a while. Rufin is a French physician who has spent many years working with Doctor's Without Borders. His writing reflects his medical background as well as his love of and regard for his fellow human beings.<br />Rufin is both romantic and a realist. A major thread in the plot of THE ABYSSINIAN involves a romance between his protagonist Jean-Baptiste Poncet, unlicensed lower-class medical practicioner living in Cairo, and Alix Maillet, the beautiful upper-class daughter of the French Ambassador to Egypt. Rufin's story is made real by his deft interweaving of actual historical events and evocative fictional episodes he has crafted from his obvious knowledge of the era and it's political machinations.<br />The basis of the book is an event that occurred in 1699 when Louis XIV sent an embassy of ministers, Jesuits, and a physician to the Negus or King of Abyssinian. The Negus was sick and admitted the strangers only because they accompanied the physician whom he hoped would provide a cure for his malady. In the 17th Century, Abyssinia was a mysterious Coptic Christian country closed to outsiders for centuries. The nation-states of Europe and the Muslim countries of the near east struggled for control of Abyssinia which lay in North Africa southeast of Egypt. A desire for economic gain through trade lay behind the French King's offer of a physician to the Negus.<br />But other factors were at play. In the 17th Century, conflict continued between various Roman Catholic orders, between Catholics and Protestants, and between Christians and Muslims, all of whom sought relgious dominance. THE ABYSSINIAN is populated with French Jesuits, Italian Domincans, and Muslim imams all struggling to convert Abyssinians. The Jesuits' goal was to use the King's embassy as a means of penetrating the Coptic populace for the purpose of proselytization.<br />Like Dumas' action-thrillers, Rufin's book is filled with sword-play, gallantry, and back-stabbing, but unlike Dumas, Rufin's characters are fully developed. Poncet's sidekick, the apothocary Maitre Juremi is vividly drawn. Both Alix and Francoise (Juremi's love interest) are &quot;real&quot; women. Poncet is an honorable young man who seeks to win his fortune and claim his love's hand without selling his soul. His mission is dangerous and as he attempts to make his way back to Alix, the reader will wonder if he can possibly accomplish his goal in an age 'sans merci'. Long after you've read THE ABYSINIAN, you will recall the vivid imagery of an exotic place now lost to the world though civil war, and the wrenching suffering of a pair of lovers separated by the cruel irony of chance.enetrating the Coptic populace for the purpose of proselytization.  <br />Like Dumas' action-thrillers, Rufin's book is filled with sword-play, gallantry, and back-stabbing, but unlike Dumas, Rufin's characters are fully developed.

Well, I've finally finished WITH A CRACK IN HER VOICE and I am certain this the most boring biography I've ever read...and I've read hundreds of biographies and autobiographies. The first part of the book is so boring I almost tossed it in the wastebasket a dozen times (and I bought a hardcover!!).<br />If I can believe what John Miller writes, Judi Dench never had a date until she met her husband Michael Williams in her mid-thirties. Maybe she did, maybe she didn't. Miller's writing seems to have improved a bit after Judi marries Michael Williams, but I say &quot;seems&quot; only because the first half of the book was so dry and dull.  Maybe Judi herself keeps everything under wraps?<br />After reading this book, I can understand why a frustrated reporter once asked Judi &quot;When is the first time you had sex and with whom.&quot; I imagine the reporter was desparate. The result of this incident according to Miller has been that Judi Dench no longer does press conferences. Unlike her character Jean Hardcastle, the Judi Dench of this book is flat and sexless.<br />Judi Dench is one of my favorite actresses. I've followed her career since I first discovered her in ROOM WITH A VIEW in which she co-acted with Maggie Smith another favorite.  I'm an Anglophile and I love British Theatre and Shakespeare. I've seen most of the plays she has performed in at one time or another (other actors, but I have seen many RSC productions). I've seen all the episodes of her two tv shows and most of her movies (not a James Bond fan).  I own VHS tapes and DVDs movies of her work. I LOVE JUDI. I bought this book because I thought I would learn more about the &quot;real&quot; Judi and her husband Michael.  Forget it.  Michael is barely mentioned.  Jeffrey Palmer gets more coverage.<br />WITH A CRACK IN HER VOICE is really a synopsis of Judi's work over the last half century.  If you love the theatre and want a glimpse of the creativity and toil that goes into a stage production, you'll get a little glimpse of it in this book. If you are not familiar with the older British actors who have worked with the RSC over the past few decades you may not recognize many people. If you recognize Elisabeth Garvie then you will probably enjoy the sections of the book that discuss casting and performances. If you want a list of the plays, movies, and tv shows Judi has appeared in over the past 50 years, you'll obtain the equivalent of an annotated bibliography in this book. If you want to know more about the real flesh and blood Judi Dench, you will have to wait.<br />One anectdote led me to believe this could have been a different book. John Miller writes of Judi's experience while performing in Hamlet in the 1980s. One night Daniel Day Lewis, who was playing Hamlet, fell to pieces. His own father had died recently just as Hamlet's father has died before the play opens. After Day Lewis finished the ghost scene, a fellow actor found him collapsed in the hallway in tears and he gathered him in his arms and comforted him. In this one little shared memory, Miller reveals Judi is capable of recognizing real human pathos and not just play acting the stage version.l get a little glimpse of it in this book.

I've been carrying ITALIAN DAYS by Barbara Grizzuti Harrison in my backpack to work--reading it on the train and over lunch. I think you'd better be eating a meal or at least not in a state of hunger when you read this book or you will lose your mind.<br />Harrison is of Italian descent, her maiden name is Grizzuti, and although she grew up in New York, her family hails from the south of Italy. The composition of this book is similar to that of Henry James' ITALIAN HOURS -- a composite of many trips, although the organizing priciple for Harrison's book is her current journey south for homecoming of sorts. She is a native American, but is connected to Italian relatives. I found her writing very reminiscent of M.F.K. Fisher, part observer, part philospher, part historian, part wanderer.<br />Harrison is divorced, and has a older child who is not traveling with her. She appears to be in her mid-forties, is attractive enough to be told so and &quot;hit on&quot; by some of the Italian males around her. She has a few interesting women friends who drift in and out of her stories. These women are coping with boyfriends and husbands and as they share their various woes Harrison recounts a few of her own.<br />Her writing is so warm and wonderful I felt as if I was inhabiting her body as I read. Unfortunately, as I read, I would be eating a chicken salad sandwich from the cafeteria at my desk while she was having a delectible meal of angel hair spagetti, baby asparagus, feta cheese and warm olives, served with a lovely local red wine, at an outdoor table on the cobblestones of a plaza before 12th century church in the warm Italian sun.<br />Harrison is a devout Roman Catholic, she attends masses and lights candle for loved ones.  She visits churches and describes them in detail. She writes of the history of the church, WWII, the Romans, and other major forces in the development of Italy. She is cognizant of the &quot;death in the midst of life&quot; and the three great mysteries of life: childhood, love, and death. &quot;As I am so shall you be, as you are now I once was.&quot; She observes people and describes them. She visits the graves of Shelley and other writers. She comments on the travels of Henry James and Ruskin whom she has read. She misquotes Byron.<br />Consider ITALIAN DAYS as the diary your best friend kept about her journey home to visit the old country and see all the relatives, and then shared with you.

PERILS OF THE NIGHT by Patricia Hall continues the exploits of Laura Ackroyd, copper-haired news reporter, and Michael Thackery, policeman with a past.  Laura and Michael are a compelling couple--both very likeable and not overly cute. I belive PERILS is the fourth book in Hall's series on this pair and I hope she writes dozens more.  Laura and Michael met in DEATH BY ELECTION which is particularly well written, and salient given recent election politics in the U.S.. The couple become better acquainted in DYING FALL, closer in DEAD OF WINTER and are working together again in PERILS.<br />Laura is an excellent reporter, fighting to establish herself in a man's world which means getting assignments off the feature page and on the front page.  Michael worries that Laura's skills may someday encourage the London papers to entice her away from Yorkshire. But Laura has a grandmother living in Bradford with whom she is very close, so she's not likely to take off soon.<br />Sometimes Laura's investigative reporting efforts lead to conflicts with Michael, a relative newcomer on the local police force, who is trying to establish credibility with his new employers.  Both Laura and Michael seem mature enough to deal with the job-related conflicts that can affect their personal relationship, but from time to time tempers flare.<br />Hall's plot device in PERILS is interesting--both main characters frequently turn up at the same job location because  something of interest to both the newspaper and the local police occurs. In PERILS both become involved in the murder of a college student who turned tricks on the side before one of her clients apparently killed her. Laura had been developing an undercover piece on the exploitation of women prostitutes before the murder. Michael becomes involved when murder and prostitution intersect.<br />This is a short book--220 pages and can be read in one sitting, but it's rich and filling as a chocolate eclair.	2001-03-11

For the longest time, humans did not understand reproduction.  Maybe they still don't. According to archeomythologists like Marija Gimbutas (THE GODDESS) humans first believed they came into existence spontaneously from the Goddess. After all, they could empirically detect that babies came from female bodies so why shouldn't a great big female goddess be the source of all life. With the arrival of Indo-Europeans in old Europe came the belief that the source of life was God the Father. After all, didn't the Bible say God made Adam and Eve and later on planted the baby Jesus in Mary? Her womb was merely a vessal to carry him (Zeus!! if she had been his real mother he would have been at least half human).<br />The second millenium of the Common Era produced a new twist on an old way of thinking. Renaissance men, being devoutly religious, still believed the source of all life was male, but now they sought to demonstrate this &quot;truth&quot; scientifically.<br />The &quot;father of insemination&quot; Spallanzani, demonstrated with frogs that male sperm was a requisite for the production of progeny. Correia tells of Spallanzani and his research in her amusing chapter &quot;Frogs with boxershorts.&quot;  But the Italians weren't the only scientists interested in sperm. Dutch scientists like Nicholas Hartsoeker (the heart searcher with the microscope), Antoni van Leeuwenhock, and Swammerdam fiddled with fleas and tulips and &quot;advanced&quot; the theory of spermism--that preformed little characters (homunculi) were planted in females (think penises) and then grew into babies. The female was still merely the vessal for rearing these perfectly formed progeny (think kangaroo pouch).<br />Dr. Clara Pinto Correia, professor of developmental biology says the theory of preformation was still being discussed in the 19th Century. Although the jacket of THE OVARY OF EVE insists men and women were engaged in the study of preformation, the truth according to Correia is that this was a male-insprired activity largely driven by the belief that males were the source of life.<br />Preformation was a wrong turn down a dead-end street. Usually historians tell us the story of scientific sucessesses, but what makes this book so interesting is that Correia tells us the amusing and heart-breaking story of the losers. And, these losers were a pretty impressive bunch of guys. Many of them were geniuses we know for other reasons, who were failures on spermism/preformation front, but sucessful elsewhere. This is a fascinating, readable and wonderful story that involves demons, dragons and Dracula. I recommend THE OVARY OF EVE to anyone who loves science and a good mystery.was a male-insprired activity largely driven by the belief that males were the source of life. <br />Preformation was a wrong turn down a dead-end street.

MANUAL OF WOODY LANDSCAPE PLANTS by Michael Dirr is a huge book with hundreds of entries, many, but not all, shown with illustrations (twig and leaf structure of branch speciments only; bark texture, trunk/branch shape and mature plant specimens are not shown). The plasticized hard cover will hold up to use, but the pages are a bit on the thin side. The MANUAL is too big to take on a nature walk, so you will have to bring plant specimens home if you intend it for that purpose.<br />THE MANUAL contains a 'Scientific Name Index' and a 'Common Name Index' so, for example, you can find cross references for Littleleaf Linden and 'Tillia cordata' as well as various 'Juglans' or nut trees. Although it's jam-packed with useful information, the MANUAL is far from exhaustive. Sometimes obvious examples are missing. I've had a nut tree in my back yard for almost thirty years, which I belived was a Black Walnut until I had a tree specialist prune it.  He tells me it's a Persian Walnut, or English Walnut as it's known at the grocery store. I eagerly searched my new MANUAL and found a small entry with no illustration and little detail to help me distinguish it from the Black Walnut I believed it to be. Apparently the tree sprouted from a nut buried by a squirrel.  As far as I know the Persian Walnut is not a native species and the MANUAL does seem to be more inclusive of native woody species.<br />The MANUAL contains a section on Roses, but you'll find a better guide for these woody flowering plants in other sources such as BOTANICA'S ROSES or the AMERICAN GARDEN BOOK published by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. There are no color photos of the roses listed, nor does the MANUAL reveal the requisite growing requirements.<br />All in all, the book is moderately useful for the gardener or the naturalist, but you will probably want to supplement it with other sources if you're interested in a particular group of plants like roses.	2001-03-05

A couple of decades ago The Washington Post interviewed a number of illustious writers and asked each of them to name the 10 best books they had ever read. I read the lists, mentally judging whether or not I would have selected the same books and noting the books I had not read that I might. The lists included the usual references to MOBY DICK, HUCKLEBERRY FINN, and the BIBLE, but one list included THE GLASS BEES by Ernst Junger.<br />For reasons unknown to me, I am attracted to any book with the word bees or honey in the title, but the fact that the protagonist Captain Richard was a German veteran also caught my interest. I had read many books, articles, etc. by and about U.S. soldiers and veterans, but had not read anything by or about German veterans and I wanted to know more. Also, at the time I discovered THE GLASS BEES the newspapers were filled with articles about unemployed Vietnam veterans, so the fact that Captian Richard was also unemployed further intrigued me.<br />Now I don't like science fiction, but, by the time I realized THE GLASS BEES was science fiction (at least it was when the book was written), I found myself hooked on a book I would never have gone out of my way to read, about things I did not want to know. I am a gardener, and I love nature, but this book presents a terrifying look into a world anyone who loves nature will abhor.<br />THE GLASS BEES is about the war technological forces are waging against nature. Have you read THE MACHINE IN THE GARDEN by Leo Marx? This is the next step. Forget the locomotive engine crashing through the underbrush, the technology in this book makes the locomotive engine look positively benign. Siegfried Mandel wrote in a New York Times review that THE GLASS BEES presents &quot;scenes as harrowing and thought-disturbing as any created by Karel Capek, George Orwell or Aldous Huxley.&quot;<br />When Junger wrote THE GLASS BEES he was aware of the tecnological improvisations of the Nazis including the crematoriums and rockets. The Nuremburg trials had uncovered one scientific horror after another. Junger could foresee the future when capitalistic forces would rule and everything would be artificial. Unfortunately, he was a prophet. Today our food, houses, clothing, medicines, you name it are all artificial. And, we are ruled by a dozen international corporations.<br />THE GLASS BEES is one of the top ten books I have ever read and it ought to be mandatory reading for high school students. I think of Junger's book everyday. And, just in case I might forget, over my patio, next to the wind chimes, I've hung a glass bee.ums and rockets.

Lately, I've been on a rose book collection spree, and a gift certificate for Valentine's Day allowed me to purchase two new and relatively expensive rose books, THE ULTIMATE ROSE BOOK and BOTANICA'S ROSES. Reading the reviews, I wondered which one would turn out to be &quot;the best&quot; however, both are excellent, and both have qualities that will make them more or less appealing to a reader and/or gardener.<br />THE ULTIMATE ROSE BOOK is much larger (taller, not thicker), but both books are very heavy. The quality of the photos in both books is excellent. The paper stock is fine and thick, but BOTANICA's is slick and glossy, while ULTIMATE ROSE is less reflective of light making it easier to read. Both contain additional information rose lovers will enjoy.<br />ULTIMATE ROSE contains fewer entries per page, but the type is much larger, making reading a bit easier for the sight impaired.  Entries are in alphabetical order within three categories: &quot;Wild Roses&quot;, &quot;Old and Modern Roses&quot; and &quot;Miniature Roses.&quot; For example, in the main section, &quot;Old and Modern Roses&quot;, Stirling Macoboy lists 'Honorine de Brabant' a bourbon rose with 'Honor' a large-flowered rose (modern hybrid) and 'Hot Chocolate' a cluster-flowered rose (i.e., floribunda). The subtitle of Macoboy's book is &quot;1,500 roses...selected for their beauty, fragrance and enduring popularity.&quot; His entries include some information about parentage, blooming pattern, and a bit of history.  For example, I just purchased a 'Comte de Chambord' rose and ULTIMATE ROSE is the first of a dozen books to tell me the rose is named for the sad son of Charles X who refused the crown of France and died in exile.<br />BOTANICA'S also follows an alphabetical scheme, grouping roses into &quot;Wild Roses&quot; and everything else A-Z.  BOTANICA'S lists 'Honorine de Brabant' with 'Honore de Balzac' and 'Hoot Owl', but also lists 'Honor' and 'Hot Chocolate' which ULTIMATE ROSE does not. BOTANICA'S also lists Growing Zones in addition to growing conditions and information about parentage and blooming.<br />In summary, if you can afford it, buy both books as they both contain useful and interesting information that surprisingly does not overlap. If you are more concerned with the nitty-gritty growing information, BOTANICA'S is the better buy. If you want an easy to read book with a bit of history and mythical lore, and a book that contians a select list of choices recommended by an expert rosarian, Macoboy's ULTIMATE ROSE is the better buy.ot.

You might want to read THE ORGANIC ROSE GARDEN by Liz Druitt even if you aren't planning on growing roses. Druitt has a wonderful sense of humor. For example, she says the rugosa rose must require a great deal of nitrogen since it has thorns designed to extract human blood. Each of the entries for her list of 100 is written in a friendly, helpful, and folksy way, helpful and not hokey.<br />Druitt's book contains a handy &quot;Quick Reference Chart for Garden Form&quot; with information organized by height: name; color; fragrance (***); size;  repeat bloom; hips; shade tolerance; and Best in zones (4-9). The entries for roses in alpha order follow this chart.<br />Since ROSES was written for organic gardening, the reader is advised on organic methods.  In a section entitled &quot;Getting and Planting Roses&quot; she describes the preliminary tasks the gardener must undertake to ensure she starts with good stock. She covers purchasing, layering, planting in containers and climbing roses. In &quot;Maintaining the Roses&quot; the reader learns about weeding, watering, fertilizing, pruning and seasonal care. In &quot;Trouble Shooting&quot; the author deals with pests. Because this is an organic book we learn about beneficial insects, nectary and shelter plants, and hedgerow barriers (to keep out the deer). Pests include the neighbor's dog (get a fence), fire ants (get the hormone 'Logic'); and other bugs--plant dill, garlic, or get out the hose.<br />All in all, this book is solid gold for the new or the old rose gardener and I recommend it.	2001-02-24

Although BOTANICA'S ROSES is described as an encyclopedia, the floral entries are more like annotated dictionary entries than encyclopedia articles. Each entry is succinct, ususally a paragraph or two, and contains pertinant information for the rose grower such as recommended growing zone, but I would have liked more information. ROSES is probably relatively exhaustive, that is it lists most of the extant roses. I was able to find information about two roses I purchased at the garden center last year that I could find no where else.<br />I own several other rose books, and find that no one book has all the information I require. For example, I have just purchased a 'Blanc Double De Corbert' rose.  BOTANICA'S tells me the rose is a modern, hybrid rugosa, white, repeat flowering. A paragraph of about 100 words in tiny type tells me something about the doubtful heritage of the plant and that it might produce orange-red hips. The entry also lists the growing zones, the parentage prefaced with &quot;possibly&quot; and awards the rose has received.<br />THE ULTIMATE ROSE BOOK by Stirling Macoboy tells me the double white from the village of Corbert in France is a cross between Rosa rugosa and the Tea Rose 'Sombreuil' according to Cochet-Cochet who raised the rose in 1891. the ULTIMATE entry also tells me the flowers rot in wet conditions and there are no hips.<br />SMITH AND HAWKINS 100 OLD ROSES FOR THE AMERICAN GARDEN says 'Blanc Double de Corbert' will grow and thrive under extreme conditions and produce stongly scented blooms with a bumper crop of tomato-rose hips. &quot;All in all this is one tough customer.&quot;<br />In THE ORGANIC ROSE GARDEN, Liz Druitt says 'Blanc Double de Corbert' is a hybrid rugosa introduced in 1892 and wonderful for growing in the upper south. It can withstand heat, probably because it has a little Tea blood from it's 'Sombreuil' ancestor.  Blanc even works well in partial shade.  In fact, she says, it likes a little afternoon shade. And, Blanc produces successive crops of orange-red hips as it blooms all summer.<br />What is the gardener to believe?  Well, Macoboy is English and undoubtedly, Blanc, which comes from a warmer dryier area of France does better in a warmer drier climate--not England. These various entries show you cannot hope to grow roses unless you were born with a green thumb and/or can consult more than one reference. BOTANICA'S ROSES is a pretty good reference book for American gardeners attempting to grow roses.Blanc produces successive crops of orange-red hips as it blooms all summer.<br />What is the gardener to believe?

It's taken me a week to read Laurie Garrett's THE COMING PLAGUE. I work for one of the organizations Garrett cites frequently, and was aware of much of the content of the book before I began to read, but it helps to be reminded.<br />In the mid-70s I studied epidemiology, demography and biostatistics at Georgetown as part of my graduate work. One of the statistics I learned to compute was a neonatal mortality rate based on specific causes of death--infectious and other.  We were convinced the infectious disease rates had been dropping for hundreds of years owing to human intervention and would continue to do so. Shortly after I graduated, drug resistant strains of microbes caused the infectious rates to climb again.<br />The world's population has grown dramatically in the past 100 years (1.5 billion to 6 billion) and in all liklihood will continue to expand a while longer (15 billion by 2050), but the AIDS plague with all it's attendent drug-resisitant diseases may do for humanity what the Black Plague did for humanity in the 14th Century--eliminate much of it.<br />Garrett says the microbes don't have to win, but I'm afraid they will. &quot;Know-nothing&quot; politicians, &quot;capable-survivor&quot; bureacrats, tyrants like Idi Amin and Sadam Hussein, wars spurred by ethnic hatred and religious fanaticism, homophobia, misogyny, unbridled and unregulated international commerce and exploitation of labor, degradation of the world's forests and oceans, and refugee movements all ensure the microbes will win. From the tuberculosis epidemics of the industrial age of the 19th century, to the spread of drug resistant malaria by troops and civilians in WWII, to the current spread of AIDS and drug resistent forms of TB across the world, the germs are having a field day. Garrett's book's subtitle is &quot;Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance&quot; -- and yes, Al Gore is mentioned-- a man who actually understands the disease/ecological balancing issues.<br />The world took a giant backstep in the 1980s when the U.S. leaders pretty much looked the other way and AIDS got the upper hand. With the return of the same politicians to power, why shouldn't we dispair, especially when the first act of the new administration is to pull funding from family planning agencies, who are fighting the very factors that can lead to the end of humanity--overpopulation and unprotected sex.<br />I kept thinking of Edgar Allen Poe's short story, &quot;The Mask of the Red Death&quot; as I read this book--During a plague, a group of wealthy nobles and their families sequester themselves away in a castle where they think they are safe from the disease. One night they hold a masked ball and discover that death is in their midst. You can't run and you can't hide--death is in our midst. So, you better act. Garrett lists the things we need to do, and if your're reading this review, you probably already know many of them, but, read her book anyway, just to make sure./>The world took a giant backstep in the 1980s when the U.S. leaders pretty much looked the other way and AIDS got the upper hand.

SECOND NATURE by Michael Pollen is a collection of esays that are not always well-connected or well-written. Mr. Pollen has won awards for his essays and some of them are quite good, however, the book is uneven. I think many of the readers who provided glowing reviews must have concentrated on the front half of the book which is autobiographical and hysterically funny.<br />NATURE contains several distinct sections Pollan calls &quot;Spring-Summer-Fall-Winter&quot; but his essays do not &quot;follow&quot; the gardening year. For example, &quot;Fall&quot;, the third section of the book is about the destruction of Cathedral Pines, a nature preserve owned and managed by the Nature Conservancy in Connecticut. Mr. Pollan thinks the local town folk (he is one) should have decided &quot;what to do&quot; in the aftermath of the storm which toppled the old pine trees that had inhabited the Cathedral Pines since the days of the American Revolution. Pollan would have done better to call this section &quot;Why I think I understand Mother Nature better than the Nature Conservancy.&quot; And, maybe he does, but his essay is angry, and his anger affects his argument. After reading his essay, I am not persuaded the Nature Conservancy failed since Pollan fails to provide their side of the argument which might have been quite reasonable.<br />The best part of Pollan's book contains his autobiographical essays about life with his father who refused to mow the lawn much to the consternation of his upscale neighbors; life with his maternal grandfather who made mega-bucks as a professional gardener and green grocer; and Pollan's own attempts to take up gardening as an avocation. Anyone who has ever gardened will enjoy these sections because as all good gardeners know, most folks learn through trial and error. Mr. Pollen says there are few &quot;Green Thumbs&quot; i.e. Green thumbs exist, but they are rare.<br />The book is laced with historical factoids--an eclectic assortment of information Mr. Pollan gleaned from many articles and books by garden/nature and other writers including James Frazier, Thoreau, Emerson, Alexander Pope, Henry Mitchell, Eleanor Perenyi, Allen Lacey, Elizabeth Lawrence, and Katherine White who wrote garden essays for the New Yorker magazine. Mr. Pollen is advertised on the jacket of his book as an &quot;Executive Editor&quot; of Harper's magazine, and as I read his book, I formed an image of him snipping bits and pieces from the various articles and books he edited over time and sticking them together, i.e. a cut and paste job. Mr. Pollan's book needed a better editor, and I haven't read such an entertaining, provocative and frustrating book in a long time.ormation Mr. Pollan gleaned from many articles and books by garden/nature and other writers including James Frazier, Thoreau, Emerson, Alexander Pope, Henry Mitchell, Eleanor Perenyi, Allen Lacey, Elizabeth Lawrence, and Katherine White who wrote garden essays for the New Yorker magazine.

I was born in 1942, and my earliest memories are of troop transports and the soldiers guarding the TVA dam where my grandfather was superintendent. All my mother's brothers went  to Europe to fight the war. I can still hear my mother leaning over and telling me how bad Hitler was because he crushed the Netherlands.<br />My mother was of Dutch descent. When they were small children, her grandparents had immigrated from Zeeland and Groningen in the 1870s. Their families settled in Holland Michigan. Mom and her family talked about the Netherlands and the Queen as if they had never left. Mother would point to our rosy cheeks and say &quot;Look at that Dutch complexion.&quot; They cooked Dutch food, grew Dutch bulbs and attended the Dutch Reformed Church. Although some of them were still alive when I was a child, I can barely remember my great grandparents.<br />When I visited Amsterdam a few years ago, I bought Simon Schama's book THE EMBARRASMENT OF RICHES. It is THE KEY to understanding my roots and explains to me why I think the way I do (I am a Democrat).<br />Schama writes of a time when things were more or less wonderful in the Netherlands. Yes, there was war.  The &quot;super&quot; powers could not keep their hands off the Dutch provinces. And plague was constantly lurking--even Rembrandt's family did not escape. But, for the first time in history, a real democracy began to bloom. The Netherlands IS the birthplace of Democracy.  It was the first place in the world to actually practice religious tolerance. During it's golden age, it became a destination for thousands of refugees. The Dutch economy expanded and personal wealth increased and the Netherlands experienced the first &quot;middle-class&quot; with middle class values--those same values captured later in the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.<br />What struck me most forcefully about RICHES is that the U.S. today is so much like the Netherlands of 400 years ago. The economy has been expanding since WWII, employment is at all time highs, immigrants have come at unprecendented rates, and the middle class has grown. Never before have so many had so much.<br />Schama doesn't preach, but it's easy to see the similarities. And, it's easy to see that the U.S. could suffer the same fate as the Netherlands. No, there isn't a huge superpower like France or Spain waiting to destroy the country. Today, the enemy is different--AIDS, religious fundamentalism, intolerance.<br />Schama says the Dutch saw their country as the New Jerusalem. The Dutch were sure they were God's chosen people, just as the Jews had been in the Old Testament.  Some Americans believe they are now God's chosen people--the first settlement in New England was named &quot;Salem&quot; for Jerusalem.<br />I started out to find my roots in EMBARRASSMENT, and I did. The book provided me with an enormous amount of information about the Dutch, their thinking and how it came to pervade the thinking in America today.  The Census Bureau says Dutch is one of the top 10 ancestry groups in the country. The descendents of the 16th Century Dutch have built the New Jerusalem.

I'd give it 5-stars but it was written by a German for a German market and has been translated for American gardeners.

I don't know if the story is true, but my husband speaks German and when the white fluffy stuff falls he calls it &quot;schnee.&quot;<br />ROSES contains a 20-page introduction on the history of the rose--a long history that could probably not be covered adequately in 500 pages.  Markley provides a good synopsis with the ususal mention of the Apothecary Rose, the Wars of the Roses--with quotes from some of Shakespeare's plays, and a box insert on Malmaison and Josephine's love of roses. I knew the rose was symbolic of Mary, and that rosery beads where first made of rolled rose petals, but it's nice to be reminded.<br />The remaining 200 or so pages are devoted to the botony, horticulture, and growing needs of roses as well as a nice index filled with an annotated rose list consisting of those specimins Markley prefers.  The information Markely provides about container growing, winter protection, planting and maintenance is extremely useful and detailed.<br />The photographs are pretty, but they have been doctored--the color intensified via a wash which makes the flowers appear out-of-focus. This is an unnecessary ammendment given the beauty of the roses--it appears the photos were in color to begin with. I don't know whether this is the result of inferior photography (in Germany??) or German pandering to stupid Americans who can't tell the difference, but it reminds me of the unscrupulous garden catalogs Allen Lacy complains about that alter the photographs of their stock to fool the consumer. Experienced gardeners know when they are looking at the real thing.<br />The book contains a listing of gardens in Germany where roses are grown, either as a featured plant or the main event.  Not surprisingly, the author recommends you tour these gardens in summer.  If you collect good garden books this is a useful addition for your collection.  If you're an American gardener and can afford only one book, better stick to Taylor's Rose Book which contains useful information without obviously altered photos.perienced gardeners know when they are looking at the real thing.  <br />The book contains a listing of gardens in Germany where roses are grown, either as a featured plant or the main event.

In OTHER PEOPLE'S MYTHS, Wendy O'Flaherty says &quot;God created people because he loves stories.&quot;  O'Flaherty teaches History of Religion at the University of Chicago. She says not everyone will approach her book with the same level of interest. The orthodox religious may find it sacriligious while hard-core secular humanists may find it too &quot;religious.&quot;  However, she believes some secular humanists may be ready to rethink the premise that rational thought is the only way to gain a handle on reality, and it is to them she dedicates this book.<br />MYTHS will prove illuminating to those who study the history of religion (non-theologians), fascinating to anthropologists who study other cultures, and provocative to theologians looking for inspiration. O'Flaherty's book is a synthesis of many strands from many disciplines--she likes the metaphor of weaving to describe her work.<br />O'Flaherty says myths can provide alternative answers to the fundamental questions of life and death. Juxtaposed, these answers can be deciphered like a secret code. She says myths are not lies they are fragments of the truth. Myths are the clothes archetypes wear--or structures if you're a structuralist, or parables if you're God.<br />O'Flaherty, a Jew, is a specialist in Christian and Hindu mythology.  She compares and contrasts the various stories of these two cultures with the earlier Greek myths--which she says weren't myths at all by the time they were discussed by Plato, but mere shadows of their former selves--zombies.  Myths are alive, they resonate.<br />She says Allan Bloom (author of THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND) says we have lost our classics (stories) and to a certain extent she agrees with him. But, she says, the classics to which Bloom refers never belonged to all the people whereas myths do. She tells of the Mahabharata which the most illiterate peasant in India knows. In the U.S., it's equivalent is the Bible. Most Westerners can recite some sections of the Bible.<br />As far as the classics go, they don't survive unless they are mythologized. To mythologize a story is to tell it over and over.  Not all stories can become myths. Myths bear repeating. There are many different kinds of myths, from those involving Western heros to those about characters in children's tales like Cinderella. (I discovered Cinderella is a Chinese tale--hence the small feet as an aspect of female beauty, and those slippers were fur, not glass--the tale was mistranslated!!).<br />In the information age, the theater plays a large role in the transmission of cultural myths. Movies are big in the U.S. and big in India. O'Flaherty says her favorite mythical tale is &quot;Through the Looking Glass.&quot;  She mentions other tales--both written and on film that are mythical including &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, and &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot; She says in a pluralistic society, many new tales will be mythologized, and new heros will materialize -- The Lion King, Harry Potter, and James Bond??<br />O'Flaherty wrote her book in the late 1980s before the &quot;English Patient&quot; was released as a book and film.  She says Herodotus was the first person to record the existence of a myth as an aspect of a culture.  I kept thinking as I read the book and she cited Herodotus over and over, I must watch &quot;The English Patient&quot; again.ns of the Bible.   <br />As far as the classics go, they don't survive unless they are mythologized.

You don't have to have a small work area to develop a vertical garden, but Cathy Barash, author of THE CLIMBING GARDEN wrote her book to address the needs of those who work with limited spaces. She says she grew up in an area of New York where folks had postage sized lots and were constantly seeking ways to ensure privacy without resorting to 20 foot walls.  Her book is the result of a lifetime of gardening on the vertical, a practice that has proved so popular that owners of large lots now create small intimate vertical enclosures.<br />Barash's book is beautiful, over 100 pages of color photos, many of them taken in her own garden.  She's a knowledgeable gardener too. She knows her &quot;Vines and Climbers&quot; (former title of the book).  For example, she writes that Ivy can destroy masonry, Wisteria can destroy walls, and Porcelain Berry has become an invasive weed in some places (Zone 7-8).  She recommends the three lobed Boston Ivy (Parthenocissus tricuspidata) or the five-leaved Virginia Creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia) in place of English Ivy (Hedera helix).  The Parthenocissus vines have little suction cups that support their tendrils, unlike the invasive rootlets of Hedera that insinuate themselves into the cracks of the masonry and work it away grain by grain.<br />Barash says if you live in a temparate area (or maybe any area in the U.S. except the desert) resist the urge to plant Porcelain Berry (Ampelopsis brevipedunculata).  This invasive native of Asia, along with it's cousins, Kudzu, Wisteria, and Honeysuckle, has nearly strangled the life from U.S. native plants.  One of the saddest sights in the Washington D.C. &quot;natural&quot; areas (nature preserves, parkland, bike trails, etc.) is the sight of English Ivy, Honeysuckle, Porcelain Berry, and Wisteria strangling native trees.<br />THE CLIMBING GARDEN contains a nice section on climbing plants, both annuals and perennials and woody plants. Roses are considered climbing vines, and Barash provides some information on climbing roses but not the sort of detail a rosarian would seek. She also discusses the architecture of the garden, trellises, pergolas, and other structural supports for vines. You don't have to have an ancient retaining wall to plant climbers. She provides a section of 5-6 pages on various planting designs in the back of the book.<br />I bought the book to generate ideas about how I might block out the areas beyond my garden fences, including my neighbors deck. I've seen ideas about vertical screens here and there in the various gardening magazines, but this book brings all the ideas together in one volume.rovides some information on climbing roses but not the sort of detail a rosarian would seek.

I bought the hard cover version of this book, and it's certainly worth the 12 dollars.  There are 20 projects described in the 64 pages filled with detailed information including materials you will need, template designs in the back of the book, and photos showing you how to make your project.<br />Projects include indoor and outdoor containers for multiple purposes from herb containers to flower vases. I bought the book because I want to make colorful pots for my patio (outdoors), and there are several projects devoted patio type pots. The authors use various containers for their projects including metal pails, ceramic jars, clay pots, and glass vases.  One project demonstrates how to create a weathered copper look on an aluminum pail. Another project involves painting &quot;Kitchen Herb Jars.&quot;  The patio-type pot projects include a number of ideas for creating colorful Latin-inspired containers (bright colors, bold designs).<br />If your kids are responsible, you might consider engaging them in a pot-painting party on a warm afternoon outside. My concerns with the paints (other than children) is what will be the long term effect of plants on pots and pots on plants.  1) As every gardener knows, salts and other chemicals from watering tend to discolor pots over time.  The pots shown in the photos are clean, clear and crisp and obviously not tested.  2) What is the effect of the paint on the plants growing in them, would the chemicals leach into the roots of your tomatoes for example??  I suppose the best idea would be to create the painted pot and then place a plant in a &quot;real&quot; pot on the inside.  This would mean starting with two pots, one larger than the other.<br />Most of these items will probably suffer the wear and tear of weather, so it might be wise to bring them inside or store (sans plants) in the garden shed over winter.  All this fuss won't keep me from painting pots.	2001-02-04

HERBS IN POTS by Rob Proctor and David Macke is a sweet little book filled with all sorts of &quot;neat&quot; ideas. If you don't have much experience growing plants in containers or otherwise, pots of herbs are a good place to begin. Even if you have limited space, as long as you have plenty of sunlight (a balcony in the blazing sun?) you can grow herbs in pots. If you end up buying your herbs at Whole Foods, you can use the recipes the authors share and put your herbs in the cooking pot.<br />This is a beautiful glossy book with lots of color photos. The authors are folksy and fun to read and they provide text and pictures that explain how you too can grow beautiful pots of herbs and use them in tasty dishes.<br />Chapter one discusses 'Herbal Care' where practical hints are provided for the new herb grower. Take watering for example. Even drought tolerent herbs require watering. On the other hand, depending on the pot of choice, overwatering can cause problems. The authors note the most likely cause of death is not Mother Nature, but Mother Hen overwatering her pots.<br />The second chapter is entitled 'The Cook's Patio' and contains photos of handome lettuces, lacy kale, and Italian parsley, as well as many interesting recipes. One can grow herbs singly or in groups in a single pot.  Herbs provide accents for the cooking pot as well as the patio. Gazpacho or Pesto anyone?<br />The later half of the book provides the reader with examples of pot containers, planting designs, and eclectic notions.  For example, one might plant herbs in used Twining tea tins or enhance plant containers with odd paraphanalia such as shells and small rocks. The book is visually appealing, and contains some of the most original ideas I've come across in a while. This is a nice gift item for a new homemaker.	2001-02-01

CREATING AND PLANTING GARDEN TROUGHS by Joyce Fingerut and Rex Murfitt is a pragmatic and down-to-earth (or hypertufa) work book with 164 jam-packed detailed pages printed on non-gloss  heavy paper. The book contains about 10 pages of color photos, so if you're looking for a &quot;look-book&quot; as opposed to a &quot;work-book&quot; don't stop here. TROUGHS won an American Horticultural Society Book Award, and like AHS publications and U.S.D.A. government publications this publication is filled with good, solid information. (Reminds me of the Girl Scout Handbook.)<br />Fingerut and Martin begin with an overview of the history and background of troughs (originally carved from solid stone and used to hold water for livestock). Even though most of the photos are in black and white, you obtain a clear idea of the beauty various shapes and sizes can add to your garden. The older troughs covered with moss are to die for.<br />A section on &quot;Hypertufa&quot; explains what it is and why it is useful for making incredibly lightweight and strong facsimiles of real stone troughs. Next, the reader is supplied a shopping list of ingredients, utensils and other supplies (rubber gloves, polystyrene foam, duct tape, etc.) needed for the trough-making project. Exact quantities and amounts are not provided, but ratios are given instead. This lack of exactness might prove frustrating to the new trough maker.<br />A good part of the book is devoted to the design and installation of plants in troughs. There are many excellent photos and an informative text describing plant choices, plant care, recommendations, etc.).  If you aren't inclined to take on the obviously dirty and labor-intensive work of making your own troughs, you can check to see if your local garden supply store or nursery sells ready-made troughs and then use this book as a guide to filling them with plants.	2001-02-01

Dr. Raphael Patai, a noted Hebrew scholar and anthropologist and author of the HEBREW GODDESS is also the co-author of HEBREW MYTHS with Robert Graves (THE WHITE GODDESS).  Those who wish to continue reading about the goddess in ancient religions will find parts of the HEBREW GODDESS quite interesting, however, Patai's book is not as lyrical as Graves' and not as readable in some sections as others. I found passages dealing with archeology in the Holy Land and quotations from the Old-Testament more interesting, and the sections dealing with the rabbinical writing of the Talmudic period proved difficult to follow (and stay awake).<br />Essentially, Patai is not suggesting Judaism has reverted to polytheism or kept a goddess in the closet all this time. He says &quot;the legitimate Jewish faith, beginning with the earliest formulations of its belief-system ...has always been built upon the axiom of One God.  He says Maimonides, the greatest medieval Jewish philosopher said, &quot;God is not a body, nor can bodily attributes be ascribed to him.&quot; Still, mere mortals have had difficulty understanding God as an abstract concept, and thus have ascribed human characteristics to &quot;him.&quot;.<br />Patai says throughout it's history Judaism has stressed the moral and intellectual aspects of God and often neglected the affective and emotional dimensions. However, since the earliest times, the Jewish people have understood God through myths and these myths personify God. This personification of God has included the goddess worship Jerimiah decried, the female attributes of the Cherubim that guarded the Ark of the Covenant, the myths of Lillith, the visions of the Shekina during the Talmudic period, and the rise of the Matronite in the 15th-18th Centuries.<br />Kabbalism during the Middle Ages was mass movement among Jews.  During this period, a popular-mythical version of the Matronite overtook and dominated the scholarly-mystical variant. The attachment among Jews to the Matronite (mother of God) had a marked resemblance to Marioloatry among Christians in the Latin countries. Kabbala mysticism was associated with the Sephardic and Hasidic elements of Judaism which also associated with the Latin countries.<br />Apparently, the Ashkenazi Jews were not as &quot;irrational&quot; and after the Jewish Enlightenment, their perspective became the dominant Orthodoxy. Still, the Sephardic practicies associated with the Sabboath, which men were instructed to keep &quot;Holy&quot; continued. Patai describes the rituals of Friday night which included the Seder meal and sexual consumation of the scholar and his wife as serving the purpose of reuniting God with his wife--Shekina.<br />Patai's original book has been expanded with new chapters covering the Shekina in greater detail. Although he stresses the importance of the theological it is not clear even yet that ordinary practicioners understand the difference between the Goddess personified and the female aspect of the One God.to the Matronite (mother of God) had a marked resemblance to Marioloatry among Christians in the Latin countries.

Back in the 1960s, Eddie Albert starred in a tv show called &quot;Green Acres&quot; about a city slicker who moved to the country with his classy wife and tried to become a farmer. The show was funny, but I did not know until I read TENDING THE EARTH, MENDING THE SPIRIT by Connie Goldman and Richard Mahler, that Albert was a bona fide garderner--big time.<br />Goldman and Mahler have interviewed dozens of gardeners all over the U.S. (some like Albert, May Sarton, and Lama Surya Das are famous, and others not), and asked a fundamental question, &quot;Why do you garden?&quot;  The answers they gathered together in this book are not surprisingly different.  Rich and poor, famous and not so famous, most folks find gardening a way to restore the spirit and flex the soul.<br />Gardening leads to the contemplation the meaning of life. Real gardening is not a war with bugs, it's a practice that reflects one's growing awareness of the creator's handiwork. The authors note that some Eastern mystics think the gardener is the last reincarnation. The gardener is acutely aware of the cycle of life, the intricate web of connectedness between and among all living things. The gardener knows human beings are not the center of the universe, and that all living things are precious. It would seem one is nearer God's heart in a garden than anywhere else on earth.<br />And, the earth is the Garden of Eden. It seems we weren't thrown out afterall. It's just that we fell from grace and many of us are unable to recognize the garden is still all around us. Original sin is the egocentric destruction the garden. We were charged to be stewards, but we often behave like naughty children smashing our toys. And, sadly, most humans may not recognize this truth until it's too late--the enemy is us.<br />How do humans change and reconnect with the Garden of Eden? The authors tell of kids and adults turning garbage strewn lots into green spaces in the center of the city (Thank you Bette Midler and The Trust for Public Land). They interview the infirm, physically handicapped, mentally challenged--all of whom have been helped through gardening. They talk to older folks who've moved to apartments or retirement homes, and found restoration in a potted plant in a windowsill, a container garden, or a small plot they tend on the grounds of their new logdings. They tell of prisoners and inmates in mental hospitals grow better after they are provided with access to a garden. And, they interview the average gardener who lives with the ordinary loss, pain, and stress of daily living.  More than one over-taxed soul has been restored by reconnecting with nature.<br />As Lama Surya Das, says &quot;Gardening gets us back to the source from whence we came.&quot; The garden allows one to act like an innocent child again, to celebrate the sense of awe and wonder.

THE PILLARS OF HERCULES by Paul Theroux is a record of one man's journey around the Mediterranean. The journey took several months and included two separate phases. Theroux tells of days of hiking, traveling by train, sailing a night steamer in a storm-tossed sea, and crusing through the sunny Greek islands on a fancy yacht. He travels light with a change or two of clothes in a backpack. He washes his clothes out by hand in the B&amp;B's and cheap hotels he frequents. He grabs meals here and there.<br />Along the way he notes the writers who have passed before him, Robert Groves who lived at Deya with his WHITE GODDESS, Lawrence Durrell who knew Gaul well, the ancients including Herodotus. He stops to talk with living writers and reflect on the conditions of the areas he visits.<br />Theroux has written about his travels in many parts of the world, and though I've read some of his other works, I enjoyed PILLARS the most--probably because I am familiar with some of the places he describes along the coast of the &quot;sea in the midst of the land&quot; and I maintain a connection to the area.<br />Beginning in Cadiz Spain, founded by the Phoenicians 4,000 years ago on the Atlantic--where the real Pillars of Hercules probably existed--Theroux follows the coast from Spain to Italy to the Dalmatian Coast onto Greece the Levant, Egypt and then across North Africa.  He relates his pleasure with one of the modern pillars of Hercules--Gibralter--the huge limestone rock jutting from the coast of Spain into the Straights of Trafalgar. Hundreds of British sailors and marines from the Napoleonic Wars are buried on this little spit of land England bought with blood and Spain wishes to reclaim.<br />Theroux takes the train up the Spanish coast, catches a ferry past the islands of Mallorca and Corsica and onto the Italian coast. He continues by train along the Italian coast which he notes becomes progressively more sordid as one travels southward toward Naples. On the Dalmatian Coast, he travels by car (taxi) for a while and notes the thriving stolen automobile business.  He passes by the pillboxes built for war and abanoned that now serve as housing for the poor Albanians.  He comments on Hoxha's ruthless abuse of the Albanian people.<br />He passes through Thessalonika, an ancient Greek city where hundreds of Jews lived for centuries before the rise of facism in Italy and the creation of the death camps. He leaves the Mediterranean for a while at this point, and when he resumes his journey he is on a yacht to Istanbul--the fabulous port once known to the Romans as Constantinople.<br />Finally, he is on land again, in the Levant, traveling by bus through god-dominated and god-forsaken areas fought over since the dawn of time. On his long trek through Turkey, Lebanon, and other war-torn terrain he notes a huge Crusader fortress that still stands almost a millenium after it's constuction, Palestinian refugees, Israeli roads paved with U.S. taxpayer money, and the grinding poverty on all sides in spite of oil wealth.  His journey through the Muslim dominated countries of Western Asia and Northern Africa are difficult and at times dangerous. He skirts Libya and moves onto Tunisia.<br />Theroux's writing is reflective, even sardonic at times. He a critical observer, but not untruthful. Most travel books are designed to advertise the countries, places, cities they describe--and therefore by nature dishonest. Theroux is not selling the places he visits.  No, this is not a travel book in the strictest sense, but it is a book for the armchair traveler who wants to know the world a little bit better. Given the ancient history of this area and the relevance of this part of the world this is not a book to be missed.oast, he travels by car (taxi) for a while and notes the thriving stolen automobile business.

Okay, it's the middle of winter, Christmas is past, and now is the time to break out the gardening catalogs and begin plotting the new growing year. According to Henry Mitchell, we can enjoy the garden year-round if we plan strategically and the middle of winter is a good time to begin.<br />Mr. Mitchell wrote two weekly columns for the Washington Post for a number of years--one of them a garden column I never missed reading. His garden columns have been preserved in several books. ONE MAN'S GARDEN follows his first book THE ESSENTIAL EARTHMAN which spread his well-earned reputation as a garden guru far beyond the Post market area. These two books were published while he was alive so one must assume they were collections of his favorite essays. The essays are arranged by season and correspond to the months he wrote them.<br />Mitchell can be read by gardeners living anywhere. Although his essays contain information helpful to those working in Zone 7, the reader can glean sage advice applicable anywhere.  He shares anecdotes about his experiences in his own backyard, and while that might seem far from novel as every other Tom, Dick, and Henrietta is writing a garden book these days, his essays are the best.  His writing is funny, philosophical, useful, and a joy to read, especially on a cold winter day when you need to be reminded of irridescent dragonflies hovering over lily ponds (former horse troughs).<br />In his essay on dragonfiles (July) he informs us they require lily pads for landing, they can't just plop on the water like a pelican. This little item helped me understand I needed to do more to make my back yard friendly to butterflies, dragon flies, and their insect kin. I now have shallow spots in my birdbaths where they can dip their tiny feet.<br />Mr. Mitchell shares all sorts of interesting insights from his adventures with clinging vines--planting them where they will not grow, growing native variants such as the American Wisteria.  The American Wisteria is often overlooked by those who grow the &quot;Oriental&quot; kind from China which Mitchell says if left untended can form a 20-foot clump in the middle of your yard. The Chinese Wisteria is very ornate, and the U.S. Park Service has planted it all over the National Gallery of Art on the Mall, but the American Wisteria is a pretty little thing better suited for the back yard.  Mitchell says you can see this Wisteria in bloom at the Henry Botanical Foundation in Philadelphia.<br />Mitchell's essays range far and near, from Jefferson at Monticello to flower shows in faraway places. He writes in December of bananas, not a local plant in Zone 7 by any means, but one Mitchell considered a &quot;great good plant&quot; nevertheless and he grows one in his back yard in a pot.  Although MItchell died several years ago, his essays are every bit as timely useful and funny as ever, and not to be missed.teria is often overlooked by those who grow the &quot;Oriental&quot; kind from China which Mitchell says if left untended can form a 20-foot clump in the middle of your yard.

Well I wish it weren't so, but this book is probably the last  collection of essays by Henry Mitchell.  It was compiled posthumously by his wife and contains the essays he did not include in his two books THE ESSENTIAL EARTHMAN and ONE MAN'S GARDEN. Although one might assume these essays are inferior, they are not, they are simply the ones he wrote after he published his two books which were collections of his essays to that point.<br />As Allen Lacy says in the introduction, &quot;For a couple of decades, the luckiest gardeners in the nation were those who subscribed to the Washington Post and ...on Thursday...could turn to Henry Mitchell's &quot;Earthman&quot; column.  I can remember a rival column at the time, written by Jack Eden, and while Eden would be spraying for insects and dumping tons of fertilizer on his lawn, Mitchell dug up his lawn and turned it into garden.<br />The essays are arranged by season--a collection of random writings that appeared in monthly columns in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His writing is warm, witty, and a joy to read on a cold winter day or in the middle of summer sitting on the patio with a tall glass of lemonade.<br />He covers a variety of plants, grown in his own yard from those solid citizens--roses, peonies and irises--to the esoteric banana trees in pots and lilies in his horse trough pond. In one essay on plants that make their own elbow room, he writes of Agaves in pots that simply crack the sides when the pots become too small, the lotus that eventually sends tubers far beyond the tub, and the water lily that ran a hole in the side of the tank and escaped.<br />The book is lovingly illustrated by Susan Davis to whom he dedicated the book, and Allen Lacey has written a very nice introduction. Mr. Mitchell died in the early 1990s but his essays are as fresh and wonderful today as they were the day he wrote them. I love his books and wish I had originally bought them all in hard cover as I have read them over and over.	2001-01-21

Last year, I bought both Hillier's BOOK OF CONTAINER GARDENING and David Joyce's book THE COMPLETE CONTAINER GARDEN. Joyce's book is a Reader's Digest book. RD distills a lot of information in a small space (i.e. the Time-Warner of gardening), however, RD books are never as well developed or thorough as those by Rodale. Joyce and Hillier both hit the high points, although Joyce's book contains over 500 color photographs, many dealing with color arrangements which I found visually appealing. Joyce's book is practical and could serve as a coffe table book. Hillier's book is funtional and not as visually appealing to me.<br />Both books contain discussions of containers, plant stock and construction methods. Neither book provides enough information about the pitfalls of container gardening including the synergistic effects of plants.  Other pitfalls include moisture requirements--what happens when moisture loving stock are mixed with plants that can withstand a bit of neglect. Light requirements are also an issue--petunias don't do well in the same locations as impatients.  Joyce provides a climate-zone growing information and a short section on overwintering.  Neither provides a great deal of information about what will survive which conditions. Joyce includes some information about annuals, but deals with perennial stock more than Hillier.<br />Hillier's book is a less complex and will appeal to those just beginning to make container arrangements for balconies and other small areas. I gave Hillier's book to my daughter who is beginning her gardening career, and kept Joyce's book for my self as I am ready to experiment a bit with longer term arrangements (cacti/succulent, topiary, bulbs).	2001-01-20

I enjoyed Peter Robinson's IN A DRY SEASON so much I did something I seldom do with mysteries, I kept the book and did not pass it on to the local library. COLD AS THE GRAVE is not as well written. It is interesting but overly long for the interest it generates.<br />You may find yourself wondering about Bank's many mental references to earlier cases. I wondered if the references were pertinent to the plot at hand and it seems the majority were not. If Robinson added them to generate reader interest in his former books he failed on my account. Although I finished the book a few hours ago, I can't remember a single specific, and feel only annoyance that he added anything except references to IN A DRY SEASON. I think many of the other references could have been eliminated.<br />Robinson (Banks)is familiar with many different kinds of music--or did a lot of research for this book.  While I recognized some of his musical allusions, I became lost. His musical notation is encyclopedic. I suspect most readers are like me, limited in their musical knowledge, and will find the jumble of references overwhelming and distracting. There is nothing wrong with a love of music, Morse loves his Wagner but he's not mentioning it every other page and he's also not into reggae, jazz, hip-hop, blues, ballads, country-western, etc. The title COLD AS THE GRAVE comes from a folk ballad, so I suppose Robinson was trying to weave an integrated story with a musical theme, but something just did not work for me.<br />The plot is a bit hackneyed and contrived. Banks consumes entirely too much alcohol on the job--makes Morse look like a piker. Pardon me, but I don't believe drinking makes you think better. The other adults are sloshed a good part of the time too -- an ironic twist as they are all so concerned with the drug consumption of the young people who are simulaneously ingesting cocaine, ecstasy, Viagra (yes), and a variety of other drugs. Everyone young and old seems to find Marijuana stimulating.<br />In COLD AS THE GRAVE, Robinson has portrayed a Methodist couple as fanatical non-smoking, non-drinking, non-dancing religious prigs who made their little girl wear shoes that pinched so tightly her toenails came off and left bloody stumps! Excuse me! My mom was Methodist and she drank, danced, and smoked and I never wore shoes that did not fit. Robinson obviously does not know the Methodists I know. I am tired of the religious right trying to jam it's agenda down my throat, but I am also equally tired of &quot;sophisticated&quot; writers making fun of people with religious convictions. Couldn't we just give it a break and get back to good old fashioned humanistic secularism--live and let live!!<br />I kept asking myself who is the audience for this book?  Research shows that the typical mystery reader is a female over 50. Robinson does a credible job for this audience because he is not given to exploitation of the opposite sex by the protagonist, eschews gratuitous violence, and his female characters are mostly not caricatures. Annie Cabbot is very real and I find her likeable. Some of the other female characters are equally believeable including Banks' daughter Tracy and his wife Sandy.<br />Robinson does not write as well as P.D. James--in spite of what the book jacket says, though IN A DRY SEASON showed a great deal of potential. I prefer the character development of James, Reginald Hill, and Patricia Hall who all write modern British crime novels featuring cop-protagonists. And yes, Morse is one of the best cops ever.stimulating. <br />In COLD AS THE GRAVE, Robinson has portrayed a Methodist couple as fanatical non-smoking, non-drinking, non-dancing religious prigs who made their little girl wear shoes that pinched so tightly her toenails came off and left bloody stumps!

THE ITALIAN GIRL by Patricia Hall is extremely well written and kept me fully engaged during the 5-6 hours I spent reading it this rainy Sunday afternoon. GIRL is precisely the sort of mystery I like--not too bloody! Well, more than one corpse surfaces, but the novel contains no gratuitous violence and Hall's character development and plot are excellent.<br />DCI Michael Thackeray, one of the main characters, is a recovering alcoholic with a sad secret he finally decides to share at the end of the story. His companion Laura Ackroyd, a feature news reporter for a local York paper is a red-headed, zealous, and at times dangerously impulsive young woman, but extremely likeable nevertheless.  Laura's charming grandmother Joyce is a fiesty 80-year old who was probably just as reckless in her youth. Heck she's daring in her eighties!! Joyce's life-long causes--decent housing for the less well off, affordable and adequate health care, and safe and well-run nursing facilities are important if not trendy at the moment. If Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan are your role-models, you won't like Joyce!!<br />GIRL begins with the search for the identity of a skelton excavated at the site of a new housing project. The remains are  quickly identified in spite of having been buried six feet under for nearly fifty years, largely owing to the presence of a gold cross found with the corpse (and featured on the book jacket). The remainder of the story involves a search for the killer. The murderer is some one she knew.  I did not realize who it was until almost the end of the book because there are several possibilities, and Hall does a good job of laying out the clues and red herrings.<br />The little gold cross on the front cover is a symbol of many things including some rather interesting insights Hall shares through her characters about Roman Catholocism. As a former RC, I really appreciated her insights, but if you're terribly orthodox, you may not.<br />One reviewer quoted on the book jacket says Hall's writing is comparable to that of Elizabeth George, but I don't think so for several reasons. George writes extremely long books with a great deal of redundancy. Her plots are hysterical, and at times her characters behave in unbelivable ways.  And, George's detectives are aristocrats. Hall's main characters are not aristocrts (think democrat, think liberal, think labor) but ordinary and mostly believeable people,  Hall's writing is succinct and realistic. I will definitely read more of Hall's books.on the book jacket says Hall's writing is comparable to that of Elizabeth George, but I don't think so for several reasons.

Simon Schama's book, LANDSCAPE AND MEMORY is a work of philosopy, mythology, history, art history, and a personal reflection of his life as a Jew. He says he has written a history, and &#34;like all histories, this is less a recipe for action than an invitation to reflection.&#34; LANDSCAPE is his most autobiographical book to date. It is not a detailed history of a particular place and time (like PATRIOTS AND LIBERATORS), but rather a synthetic work discussing nothing less than the meaning of life.<br />To support his thesis that aesthetic and religious expression and nature have always been and remain interconnected, Schama weaves together a variety of elements from many Western historical periods and places. Although on one one level his book could be viewed as a survey of Western art it is not. His premise is that our cultural legacy is the veneration of nature, that we do not inhabit a nature versus cultural world. Our culture is formed from our experience and our memory of our natural world. God is in the details and the impression of the Creator is impressed on the face of her creation.<br />LANDSCAPE has four main sections: Wood; Water; Rock; and Wood, Water, Rock. He begins with a backward journey to Eastern Europe, where his Jewish ancestors lived long ago. He searches for the family roots, and is reminded by a colleague, &#34;Jews have legs, they don't have roots.&#34;  Schama describes the great forest of Poland, oddly named Bialowieza--the realm of the Lithuanian Bison. Over the centuries, the forest has provided sustenance and sheltered many. During WWII, it became the hunting ground of the Nazis. His travels take him to Buchenwald the forest of beeches, once worshiped humans and now linked with the horrible deeds of men. Later, with his family, he stands in awe at the base of the giant redwoods--trees the Americans venerate and that the great natualist John Muir urged Teddy Roosevelt to protect for future generations.<br />Schama discusses the various myths associated with the forest--many of them tied to the German and Celtic people. His stories include the 'Green Man' linked during the Middle Ages to Robin in England, and the sacrificed Lord whose flesh was nailed to a tree. He ends the section with a discussion of the great work of Sir James Frazier, the old stouthearted conservative Scot and adherent of rational thought who in his wildest dreams never realized what he unleashed in his efforts to prove the uselessness of nature myths in his book THE GOLDEN BOUGH.<br />The second section of Schama's book covers water, wide rivers, flowing streams, and discusses the culture of the Nile with it's legends of Osiris and Isis. He tells the reader the word for palm and immortality are identical in the old Egyptian language. The palm is the tree of life whose waters flow in the form of oil and other liquids. He tells of Cleopatra and her lovers, Caesar and Mark Antony, and Napoleon's infatuation with all things Egyptian.  He ends this section with a sad reflection of the destruction of the various temples of antiquity wrought by the building of the Aswan Dam and the flooding of the Nile River valley.<br />In the third section, we follow the exploits of those who attempted to conquer Mont Blanc and the highest wildest peaks of Europe. We see Bryon and Shelley on Lac Leman searching for various mythological sites and lamenting the drowning of prisoners at Chillon. Oh what is it about the mountain that sparks memory and drives humans to scale it, to embrace it, or in the case of a few deface it (Mount Rushmore, Stone Mountain in Georgia where a KKK rider was planned).<br />In section four, Schama wraps up his book with a discussion of Acadia--which Acadia?  The Europeans alternated beteen terror and awe in their search for Acadia. &#34;Et in Acadia Ego&#34; -- what does it mean. There is the Acadia of Eden where two trees grew and the land of milk and honey where lion and lamb co-exist, and there's that other Acadia, the wilderness that some still want to protect.<br />In LANDSCAPE, Schama has described the multiple forms of artistic expression that depict the relationship between nature and culture. He covers poems, prose, stories, painting, sculpture from Rodin to Rushmore, gardening from Eden to the dead spaces people call front lawns. He describes the various attempts to shape the landscape from Karnak to Capability Brown to Olmstead in Central Park. His stories range from the Italian clergyman who designed &#34;Holy Land America&#34; just off the Connecticut freeway, to the &#34;wild forests&#34; at Hampstead Heath in London, Fontainbleu just outside Paris, and Waldon Pond near Boston MA.

CHOKECHERRY PLACES by Merrill Gilfillan did not sweep me away as as one critic on the backcover suggested it might. Nor did I find Gilfillan particularly poetic. I found the book mildly interesting in places, and the sort of thing one might throw into a back pack when traveling the high plains area north-east-west of Denver--which I have done. In fact, I read it slowly, one essay per night, thinking it might bring back some of the wonderous feeling I experienced in this lonesome land.<br />Gilfillan's narrative is one step up from a travelog, the reader is conscious of a narrator, but he is no Charles Kuralt nor Paul Theroux. Some essays are better than others, but something is missing from all of them. I did not obtain a sense of Gilfillan's spirtual or moral bearing, though I think he might have one.<br />My own experience in these wild and natural places has been the great sense of awe the Transcendentalists described. I will never forget the first time I saw the buttes, those wonderous islands leftover from the withdrawal of a prehistoric sea. I don't recall Gilfillan contemplating their ontological connections, though he does note their beauty in the late afternoon sun. His writing comes close to expressing appreciation of the scenes he surveys, but he never quite suceeds with words the way Georgia O'Keefe succeeded with paint.<br />I found some of his stories disturbing. Gilfillan  apparently has no qualms about helping a man search for yellow feathers needed to round out a fan. And, no, the old man doesn't collect the feathers from the ground under trees where birds perched and preened themselves as Ben Nighthorse Campbell once suggested when describing how modern Indians make Eagle feather headdresses. The old man kills the little Finches with Gilfillan's help. The killing of these little birds doesn't register a blip on Gilfillan's ethics meter. When I read this essay, I was reminded of the many extinct birds that once lived in Hawaii. You can see their pretty little feathers in the dusty capes and helmets stored in musuem exhibit cases.<br />Nor does the digging of wild turnips seem a problem. Okay, if Gilfillan was the only person who ever dug them up what would it matter?  But he isn't, and by advertising their existance, and  the fact he felt no qualms about digging them up, he helps contribute to their extinction.  It doesn't even occur to him that one reason the plants have evolved a mechanism for losing their above ground vegetation during the warmer months is for survival.<br />Gilfillan is not a Naturalist. He is the worst sort of exploiter who roams the high plains and follows a way of life which allows him to indulge his needs and wants and through his writing to encourage others to follow. This is no Pilgrim at Tinker Creek warning us of the extinction of the Monarch Butterfly.pretty little feathers in the dusty capes and helmets stored in musuem exhibit cases.   <br />Nor does the digging of wild turnips seem a problem.

It doesn't even occur to him that one reason the plants have evolved a mechanism for losing their above ground vegetation during the warmer months is for survival. <br />Gilfillan is not a Naturalist. He is the worst sort of exploiter who roams the high plains and follows a way of life which allows him to indulge his needs and wants and through his writing to encourage others to follow. This is no Pilgrim at Tinker Creek warning us of the extinction of the Monarch Butterfly.	2001-01-08

Some readers of Beverly Nichol's books have found his writing hilarious, but I do not. I find him amusing, and have read the trilogy plus his GREEN GROWS THE CITY because they sustained my interest, but he is not P.G. Wodehouse or John Mortimer for that matter.<br />I cannot judge from Nichols books whether or not he had a particularly deep understanding of human nature. From time to time, he allowed himself to be drawn into odd misadventures with eccentric others, and he certainly had his conflicts with busy-body females, and as often as not he had charming female friends. His best friend in the world seemed to be Gaskin, his 'man' and his cats.<br />The central theme of MERRY HALL, the first book in his trilogy, is the restoration of the grounds and gardens at his old Georgian Estate.  LAUGHTER ON THE STAIRS covered the renovation of Merry Hall--the Georgian Manor house.  His third book, SUNLIGHT ON THE LAWN, has people as it's focus--those who inhabited the area in and around Merry Hall when Nichols lived there in the late forties and fifties. First, there is the sad departure of Oldfield whose gardening days come to an abrupt end. Then, there are various episodes involving the ever meddling Rose, tea with Miss Mint, fractious neighbors, overgrown fields, and wells without water.<br />As always, in a book by Beverly Nichols, there are cats. Nichols had a great love of black cats, and the cats often play a role in one of his tales. Most of the time the story is funny, but sometimes a cat meets a sad end. If you are a cat fancier, you may find his cat exploits familiar and amusing.  This is a nice book for bedtime reading and a fitting end to the series.	2001-01-06

Beverly Nichols, author of MERRY HALL says the love of gardening involves the love of art, the love of love, and the love of death. Following his experiences in WWII, Nichols retired to the English countryside to restore himself mentally, physically, and spiritually. He doesn't inform the reader directly of his background (I know this from having read some biographical material from other sources), but he had another life before he bought the house and grounds describes in his trilogy beginning with MERRY HALL. He was a journalist and writer, and during WWII he spent some time abroad in His Majesty's Service.<br />To the unknowing, Nichols narrative may seem a bit too cheerful, frivolous, or shallow, but his book is intended to entertain the reader--this is gardening mind you not the aftermath of war. To the extent he able to do so, Nichols kept the events in the DAILY MAIL out of his gardening books. As a result, some readers today can mistakenly think him an English prig who had no concern for life outside his own back yard.<br />MERRY HALL begins one afternoon when Nichols and his 'man' Gaskin stumble across a derelict Georgian manor house and it's grounds. Nichols is overcome with a desire to restore the house and rebuild the grounds. He has been living in London and until that fateful day was more or less settled, but now he wants to &quot;move beyond the Tudor world&quot; and into the world of the Georgian Manor House. He buys Merry Hall and thus begins his adventure.<br />MERRY HALL was written about six years into the project.  By that time Nichols had undertaken the restoration of the foul smelling pond just off the music room and won the support of the able Oldfield, the gardener who came with the house and grounds. The book is an interesting mixture of personal anectdote, observations about the various neighbors who have their own opinions of what Nichols ought to restore the house and grounds, insights into elements of garden design, practical advice about various bulbs, shrubs, garden ornaments such as urns and benches, and observations about greenhouses and cats.ice about various bulbs, shrubs, garden ornaments such as urns and benches, and observations about greenhouses and cats.	2001-01-06

In LAUGHTER ON THE STAIRS, Nichols continues his tale of the restoration of Merry Hall and it's grounds.  Just after WWII, Nichols purchased a derelict Georgian House and it's tattered grounds, and with the help of his 'man' Gaskins, and the able Oldfield, who had worked the grounds for most of his life, he began a restoration project.<br />MERRY HALL was written about six years into the project, and focused on the grounds.  LAUGHTER ON THE STAIRS takes place a few years, when later Nichols has turned his attention to the interior of the old Georgian House. The former owner, a Mr. Stebbing had very Victorian tastes, which Nichols dislikes, and has tried to erase. At last, he plans to address the staircase, where a stained-glass window that was &quot;unquestionably..most alarming&quot; overhang the landing.<br />Nichols nosey-parker neighbor Rose doesn't want to see the house altered. She remembers the days when Mr. Stebbing was the owner, and she does not approve of the new owner's changes. She was particularly outraged by the savage destruction of the old boxwood hedge. Now, Nichols proposes to destroy the lovely stainglass window Mr. Stebbing had installed over the staircase. Of course Merry Hall is Nichol's house and he can do what he likes, but he is concerned about the neighbors reactions to his plans. The story takes an interesting twist when burglers break in one night and in a strange way help him solve the dilemma.<br />This is a light and amusing book, and one I found very intertaining reading before bedtime.	2001-01-06

AN ENGLISH MURDER by Louise Doughty is extremely well written and very readable--I read it in one afternoon. However, Doughty's story is not like other &quot;short&quot; mysteries--or long ones for that matter. Doughty is a very clever writer, and she has created a complex little tale.<br />Doughty is obviously familiar with English murder mysteries. She has created a story for the ardent mystery reader, but one familiar with the English classics. To fully appreciate this book you need an understanding of the works of Dorothy Sayers and P. D. James and their personal reflections on the ambiguity of morality. This book is a morality play of sorts, and like the play within the play in Hamlet, there are mysteries within this mystery.<br />Dorothy Sayers created a character, a young woman writer named  Harriet Vines, who figures in her three best stories involving the detective Peter Wimsey. Some critics think Vines is a thin disguise for Sayers herself. AN ENGLISH MYSTERY contains two writers. The earnest newspaper reporter Alison Akenside lives next door to Miss Crabbe, a mystery writer.<br />Miss Crabbe's favorite book is HAVE HIS CARCASE (Habeas Corpus) by Sayers. Miss Akenside discovered the bodies (neighbors who lived on her other side), and she is writing news articles about the discovery and subsequent investigation. At one point, the narrator (Doughty?) provides an overview of what Miss Crabbe thinks about finding dead bodies, a thought which she presumeably relayed to Miss Arkenside earlier. &quot;The discovery of the body was the most important single event in a murder story - far more important than the murder itself, which ususally happened off-stage and quite right too. [Miss Crabbe] couldn't stand those modern novelists who went in for graphic garrotting and exploding eyeballs.  How tasteless to describe all those horrible things happening to a living person.&quot; At this point in the narrative, Doughty is relaying Akenside's understanding of Crabbe's thoughts about Sayer's narrative of Harriet Vines' thoughts, and the reader is inside a loop involving five mystery writers.<br />Doughty's writing is complex, laugh-out-loud funny at points (including a game of CLUE the murderer plays with the victims), sobering, and fairly accurate regarding the human condition.  As much as we might like tidy little stories that put all moral ambiguity to rest, they are not reflective of real life.  And, there are those pesky flies.

THE ENGLISH FLOWER GARDEN by William Robinson, was first published in 1883 and republished a number of times afterward.  The current version available from Amazon is a reprint of the 15th Edition Robinson edited shortly before he died in the 1930s. This new reprint of the 15th Edition contains the &quot;Botanical Revisions&quot; prepared by Graham Stuart Thomas for the 1984 Edition, as well as a Forward by Henry Mitchell, and an introduction by Deborah Nevins.<br />The book is set in old style type and contains numerous black and white illustrations--etchings of photos and prints of sketches. Some of them are a bit grainy, but many are not, and even the grainy ones have their good points.  The content of each photo is quite interesting, and the sketches provide the &quot;personal&quot; touch one seldom sees in text books these days.<br />In one print, taken at Gravetye Manor over 100 years ago, a climbing tea rose clings to a bamboo split-rail post fence surrounded by bush roses. The sunlight reflects from the walkway and warms the flowers and a huge clay pot sitting in a corner. In another photo, pots of 'Chimney Campanula' guard an old Jacobin chest sitting in a hall at Staunton Court. Sketches and photos are used to illustrate flowers all through the last half of the book--a flower dictionary with anectdotal and literary &quot;blurbs&quot; written by Robinson himself.<br />Mitchell says Robinson &quot;for all practical purposes invented gardening as we know it.&quot;  Robinson's garden, 'Gravetye Manor' is a hop, skip and a jump from Sissinghurst, but few know of it's existence. Yet, Robinson is the &quot;grandfather&quot; of Sissinghurst, because Gertrude Jekyll who helped Mrs. Nichols design Sissinghurst, was Robinson's disciple. She literally followed in his footsteps and emulated his style.<br />Robinson found most of the gardens of his day deplorable (19th Century Victorian). Those of the wealthy were modeled after the French and Italian formal plan, loaded with clipped Yews and bedded out every spring with ribbons of color provided by geraniums and marigolds. The walkways were lined with ornate scupture and surrounded by towering &quot;imprisoned&quot; evergreen shrubs and trees including clipped Yews which he loathed. He said these gardens reminded him of graveyards.<br />His ideal was the cottage garden.  He considered the garden a sacred space. He said one had to visit the houses of the poor to find truly beautiful gardens. Henry Mitchell reflecting on this says, &quot;The thing that separates the true gardener from the mere architect or designer (and there is something extremely suspicious in the airs they give themselves nowadays) is that the gardener stands in awe before his violets, while others think of them in terms of [sic] plant materials.&quot;<br />Robinson's ideas grew out of the Romantic movement of the late 18th and early 19th Century. His designs and thinking were reflected in the Arts and Crafts movement based on the importance of reconnecting to nature. His contemporaries in thinking were Ruskin, Morris, Stickly, Frank Lloyd Wright, and others we identify with this movement. If you're a Stickly, cantilevered, picturesque kind of person, you'll like this book.with clipped Yews and bedded out every spring with ribbons of color provided by geraniums and marigolds.

EARTH WORKS by Nancy Hugo is exactly the type of book you give to a new gardener along with an illustrated garden catalog.  Hugo lives in Ashland Virginia, just north of Richmond in a Zone 7 setting which borders on Zone 8.  Her book is filled with all kinds of gardening advice which she dispenses as a free lance writer for the RICHMOND-TIMES DISPATCH. Her writing is not particularly insightful (Diane Raver), funny (Henry Mitchell), spiritual (Jim Nollman), or scientific (Elizabeth Lawrence, Allen Lacey), but elements of all these aspects are present.<br />Her strength is her pragmatic advice for the novice. Picure her as the neighbor you wish lived next door to you when you move into your new house. She has gardened for over 30 years at two locations (primary home and vacation home in Buckingham County). She offers advice for Zone 7 gardeners that is comparable to that from the PBS program Victory Garden.<br />For example, she urges gardeners to grow organic and natural lawns because she is sensitive to the water pollution caused by the runoff from lawns (Americans use larger amounts of pesticides and herbicides on lawns than on food crops). On the other hand, she can take out 28 year-old pines because they are blocking her view and overshading her garden. She offers advice on gardening equipment from tillers to post-hole diggers, how to establish a compost pile, when to clip bushes and hedges, what to do with the needles that fall off the old pines, and which plants to grow for Christmas greenery. She describes her gardening year in month to month episodes, and covers a variety of plants that will do well anywhere in Zones 7-8.<br />I recommend this book to anyone about to become a gardener.	2000-12-30

THE ALBIGENSIAN CRUSADE by Jonathan Sumption is an extremely well written and readable book. Sumption was a history fellow at Magdalene College until 1975, and his historical training shows. His writing is accurate, detailed, clear, and concise. He currently serves as a QC practicing commercial law, but thank goodness he takes time away from his day job to write history. I will certainly read some of his other works. Sumption's book on the Albigensian Crusade(s) was first published in 1978, but never fear, his material is as current today as it was 22 years ago.<br />I found the sections describing the series of confusing battles de Montfort fought in Languedoc from Beziers to Murat, as well as the ever changing loyalties of the southern nobiliy and the mood swings of the Catholic Church quite easy to follow. He writes in a brisk style that provided me, a non-military enthusiast, with enough information to understand what took place without dampening my tiny enthusiasm for battle. In addition to his very rich text, Sumption's book is filled articulate maps showing the various sites where Simon de Montfort waged his crusader war. If you're about to visit Languedoc, this is the book to take along.<br />Sumption writes like Stephen Ambrose. Both provide on-the-ground detail while they simultaneously explain what was going on back at headquarters (Rome in Sumption's book). They personalize the impersonal. You also come to understand why leadership is so critical, why troops matter, why casualties happen inspite of the best plans, and just how wonderful De Montfort's tactical manuevering really was.(Yes, I know Ike was a strategist.)<br />Sumption writes dynamic and interesting passages, but he eschews the sensationalism found in O'Shea's book on this topic. Although Sumption's book provides some background on the Cathar heresy, it does not contain the detail of Lambert's book THE CATHERS.  Read Lambert's book and Sumption's book on the crusades and you will have a very good understanding of what took place in the 13th Century in Languedoc.very good understanding of what took place in the 13th Century in Languedoc.	2000-12-27

Strayer is really two books inside one jacket.  The first book, by Strayer consists of a 174-page overview of the two crusades, one led by Simon de Montfort and the second under the auspices of the French Royals in Paris.  The second &quot;book&quot; is an Epilogue by Carol Lansing, that examines heresy versus orthodoxy.<br />Strayer's book is about 30 years old, and while his writing seems mostly accurate, he is inclined to make generalizations some contemporary historians might not. For example, he says a necessary condition for the growth of &quot;heresy&quot; is a set of fluid economic and social circumstances that lead to uncertainty about personal well-being as well as exposure to people with different ways of thinking. In other words, material conditions go a long way toward explaining a diversity of faiths.<br />Strayer says the feudalism of the north (France) was virtually nonexistent in Languedoc (Strayer calls it Occitania) and primogeniture was not the hereditary rule. At the death of the father, properties were split up amongst the sons, and the wealth and power of successive generations diluted. Often, the loss of noble wealth and power was augmented. One means was to become a member of the Roman Catholic clergy and the other was commerce. The redistribution of wealth and power led to a new social order where the cities became dominant.<br />Languedoc, lay at the end of a main trade route that ran through Italy and into the East, and by 1200, the area was more like Italy with it's independent cities based on commercial wealth, than the feudal north with it's huge rural estates owned by landed nobility. New ideas and new people settled in Occitania, bringing diverse religious practices. In addition to the Cathars, the area was home to Jews, Mohammadens, and Waldensians. Roman Catholic clergy soon found their limited authority challenged, and one thing led to another until the Pope launched two crusades to eliminate &quot;heretical faiths&quot; that infested Occitania. Most of Strayers's account is about the subsequent Albigensian crusades (Albi was one of the &quot;heretical&quot; cities).<br />While Strayer does not address the issue of heresy, Carol Lansing's Epilogue (59 pages) is an essay on heresy. She says the orthodox Catholics were unclear about their own orthodoxy, so determining someone else was herertical was quite a task. She concludes that for the most part, heretics were condemned by their actions, not their beliefs.<br />She says the Waldensians were orthodox and should not be confused with the Cathers who really had a completely different religion. Waldo, the leader of the Waldensians would have been thought another St. Francis of Assisi had he been born during Innocent's reign as Pope. He had the misfortune to be born 100 years to soon and thus perceived as a threat. Although they were persecuted, Waldensians still exist today, and were probably the first real Protestants.<br />The Cathers believed in a dualist God and Lansing describes several versions of their theology in her Epilogue.  Her account makes their tenets seem very confused. She says, &quot;people wove together their beliefs, drawing on the teachings and practices of the Roman clergy, the Cather perfects, their own families, and their communities, as well as their own speculation and experince.&quot;<br />I found both of these &quot;essays&quot; raised and addressed interesting points and recommend the book for anyone with a serious interest in this topic.te &quot;heretical faiths&quot; that infested Occitania.

Stephen O'Shea's book, THE PERFECT HERESY is extremely readable, and if you're on your way to Languedoc and want to know more about the Cathars, this is a good read.  However, be warned, the book is a bit biased, and there are some factual errors.<br />O'Shea relies on secondary sources, and although he quotes some &quot;primary&quot; sources (English translations) others have translated the passages differently. For example, in 1242 in the town of Avignonet, two Domincan priests, Stephen of St Thibery and William Arnald, were attacked and killed by the Cathers.  O'Shea says, &quot;Feverish hands rifled through a wooden chest, found the Inquisition register, and ripped it to pieces; a flaming brand was lowered to set the names alight.&quot;  Malcom Lambert, in his book THE CATHERS says the registers were taken and sold by soldiers.<br />O'Shea's writing, including the excerpts he uses to illustrate his points are designed to enhance the sensationalism of the story of the Cathars (he is a journalist).  For example, on page 5 he attributes a quote Arnoud Amaury supposedly uttered at the seige of Beziers, &quot;Kill them all, God will know his own.&quot; This quote was written thirty years later by a chronicler not present at the seige. Mr. O'Shea acknowledges later in the book that &quot;historians disagree&quot; about the accuracy of Amaury's statement. The chronicler wrote a French version of a mot taken directly from the Bible and put it into Amaury's mouth. So much for verismilitude.<br />O'Shea's book is mistitled.  He spends little time discussing Cather theology or &quot;heresy&quot; and much time describing Simon de Monfort's military victories (maps of field movements, etc.) which is quite interesting, and takes up about a third of the book.  What the Cathars believed was recorded by the Inquisitors.  Since they provided conflicting information some historians question if the &quot;lay&quot; Cathers really understood their faith! The &quot;Perfects&quot; or the elect apparently believed Jesus and Satan were brothers and that the world was 100 percent wicked. Dying was was the only way out. As O'Shea says, the Cathers won the war because they are gone.<br />If you want to know more about &quot;Dualism&quot; and the movement that began in Bosnia and spread to the West to Languedoc, read Lambert's book on the Cathers. O'Shea says Lambert's book is for the stout-hearted, but that is the only way to get at the truth. Historians may never fully understand what caused the conflict between the Catholic Church and the Cathers. The only thing I am certain of is that this is not a black and white world, and saints and sinners are hard to tell apart at times.r the elect apparently believed Jesus and Satan were brothers and that the world was 100 percent wicked.

THE CATHARS by Malcolm Lambert, is very informative and extremely well documented with primary and secondary material. Mr Lambert was a Reader in Medieval History at the University of Bristol in the U.K. until 1991 when he retired to write.<br />Lambert says although some think the name Cathar is taken from the Greek word for &quot;pure&quot; it was probably applied by outsiders in reference to a Satanic cat ritual.  The Cathars called themselves &quot;perfects&quot; and as far as is known they did not engage in rituals involving cats. In fact, they were vegetarians who avoided animal products. They were persecuted for their belief  that Jesus and Satin were brothers, a belief considered heretical by the Catholic Church.<br />Persecution of the Cathars took many forms, the most violent occurring in France. In the 12th and 13th Centuries, the Capet family (Louis to Phillip the Fair) was in the process of uniting France under it's rule.  The southern region, known as Languedoc, was resisting the Capets.  At the same time, several Popes (Boniface, Innocent, etc.), were threatened by German Emperors from Frederick Barbarossa to Frederick II.  The French Kings offered their protection to the Popes and in exchange, the Popes &quot;authorized&quot; the Capet family to subdue Languedoc, a Cathar stronghold. Their joint venture is known as the Albigensian Crusade.<br />Later on, the Popes sent church &quot;inquirers&quot; known as Inquisitors to investigate heresy in Languedoc. In reality, &quot;untold numbers of persons&quot; were probably not burned, but many died or were imprisoned. Of the more than 5,000 persons known to have been interrogated by the Inquisitors in Languedoc, about 50 were burned at the stake. Lambert says everything else is speculation since most of the records were destroyed.<br />In Italy, the Ghibellines were allies of the German Emperors and enemies of the Guelphs who supported the Pope. Although Frederick II had sworn to root out heresy, his &quot;rooting&quot; was lax. Many of the Ghibbilines were Cathars, and since they kept a number of Italian cities friendy to his cause so he had no great incentive to destroy them. When Frederick II died, both the Ghibellines and the Cathars were at risk. Some were burned, but many escaped to Bosnia. The Cathars in Bosnia lived a relatively peaceful existence until Islam crushed the Balkans in the 15th Century.<br />According to Lambert, the Cathars probably would have died out eventually anyway. They did not believe in sexual reproduction. Also, most people became Cathars owing to family connections and did not really understand the &quot;dual-God&quot; aspects of the religion. The Cathar theology was confusing anyway, and as people became educated, they fell away from Cathar teachings.<br />Lambert says the Cathars did not take vows of poverty as some have suggested. They were from all walks of life, nobles to maids. The attraction of Catharism lay in it's emphasis on simplicity in this life, and the emotional comfort the 'perfects' offered regarding death and the next life. In an age when many Catholic clergy were distant and aloof, and the emphasis of the church was tithing and the aqusition of material wealth, the Cathar perfects were seen as the &quot;real&quot; Christians. St. Francis of Assis suggested one way to rid the Church of heresy was to preach directly to the people and live exemplary lives of love and compassion.<br />The Inquisitors became very powerful after the 13th Century, until the 16th Century. Lambert says after the Cathars and other heretics were no longer a threat, &quot;Witchcraft fell under the purview of the inquisitors.&quot; The result was &quot;Malleus maleficarum&quot; or the &quot;bible of the witch-hunters.&quot; He says the &quot;witch craze spanned the Reformation and blackens the reputations of Catholics and Protestants alike.&quot;  Burning people was not exclusive to the Catholic Church.ot;rooting&quot; was lax.

St. Francis of Assis suggested one way to rid the Church of heresy was to preach directly to the people and live exemplary lives of love and compassion.<br />The Inquisitors became very powerful after the 13th Century, until the 16th Century. Lambert says after the Cathars and other heretics were no longer a threat, &quot;Witchcraft fell under the purview of the inquisitors.&quot; The result was &quot;Malleus maleficarum&quot; or the &quot;bible of the witch-hunters.&quot; He says the &quot;witch craze spanned the Reformation and blackens the reputations of Catholics and Protestants alike.&quot;  Burning people was not exclusive to the Catholic Church.	2000-12-19

As part of my ongoing effort to study and understand religious and spritual groups, ideas, etc. I have just completed reading THE WICCAN MYSTERIES. Relying on mostly secondary material, Raven Grimassi has done a credible job of synthesizing and articulating what he believes modern Wicca is and is not. He cites many credible sources in his text. He also uses primary material obtained from his own Italian Witch family history. I did find a few errors--dates etc. associated with the secondary material, but suspect these are probably typos overlooked during the copy edit process.<br />A major strength of this book is the organizing and classifying of the origins of the different mythos, beliefs, practices including spell-casting, etc.  This book is not about spell-casting and other &quot;black&quot; arts, however. In fact, Grimassi says one of the most ineffective ways to do magic is to try to cast spells without the proper background and training. Besides, as nearly as I can tell, for most Wiccans spell-casting has more to do with personal affirmation and visualization involving the subconscious than it has to do with putting hexes on enemies. He does mention succubi and incubi, but I am not sure exactly what he means as he omits detailed explanation. My own  interpretation: one should be careful what one wishes as it might come true.<br />A major contribution of Grimassi's book is his attempt to sort out the groups all claiming to be Wiccans. Grimassi says there is not just one Wiccan way. There are major types of Wicca and minor differences within the larger typologies. He says modern Wiccan practices evolved in the 20th Century, to a great extent under the guidance of Gardner a British practicioner.  Although modern Wicca is mostly based on old European beliefs, practices, etc. some forms of it include beliefs, practices, etc. from the East. For example, meditation is not something traditional Wiccans or witches did. Grimassi refers to Wiccans who include Eastern practices as New Age Wiccans (that's me!!)<br />An other major Wiccan group follows a more traditional path based on older European mythos and beliefs and eschews Eastern practices. But, this group is also split along some basic lines. Some of the Wiccans following the &quot;pure&quot; European path are more Celtic based, while others have a more Southern European base. Also, sex magic seems to be something some groups do, and others don't. Grimassi defends sex magic, but to my mind it is like the sacrifice of animals which the Hebrews abandoned long ago. Some practices have been abandoned because of outside pressures, but sometimes they are abandoned for equally good internal reasons.  Living in an age of AIDS has made sex magic dangerous.<br />As nearly as I can tell, Grimassi, who is an Italian witch, thinks the Italian or Southern European base is the oldest tradition--far older than the Celtic strain which from his perspective was heavily influenced by Southern magic in a variety of ways including the arrival of the mysterious Tuatha du Daanan (people of the mist, people of Danu), migrants from the Iberian peninsula, and the invasion of the Romans around 2000 years ago. Grimassi has tracked the older 'Way' back to the Etruscans and even earlier.  In fact, he links it to the old matrifocal religion of ancient Europe (before the invasion of the Indo-Europeans).<br />This is a fascinating book and one I highly recommend to anyone who is interested in Wicca or the old religion. This should not be the last book you read, however. Although Grimassi has distilled much material, he has barely touched the surface. His citations are worth pursuing if you are not already familiar with them. Also, Grimassi wrote this book several years ago, and new evidence from the archeologists, prehistorians, historians, linguists, and other scientists continues to accumulate.actices as New Age Wiccans (that's me!!)<br />An other major Wiccan group follows a more traditional path based on older European mythos and beliefs and eschews Eastern practices.

In his book WICCA: A GUIDE FOR THE SOLITARY PRACTICIONER, Scott Cunningham says, &quot;If centuries old incantations are nothing more to you than senseless gibberish, chances are the ritual won't work, any more than would a Shinto ceremony in the hands of a Methodist. To be effective, rituals must speak to you.&quot;<br />This is the heart of Cunningham's philosophy. What good does it do to engage in something that sounds like mumbo-jumbo. On the other hand, rituals can facilitate connection on the one hand with the natural world and on the other hand with the Divine. A ritual might be as simple as taking an early morning cup of tea in hand and walking into the garden to examine the crocus buds that pushed through the soil during the night. Or, it might involve taking time to pause and acknowledge a full moon shining across a lake and note a small rabbit has done the same.<br />Cunningham's book is filled with information about the various tools, accoutrements, prayers, food (receipes), practices, etc. one can use for ritual practice, as well as the dates and meanings of the various Wiccan religious holidays. In the proces of employing some or all of these items as a solitary, you might connect on an astral plane with others like yourself who are tired of churches and group rules about what is acceptable and not acceptable in the sight of your God(dess), and wish to show a reverence for this wonderful, mystical, and far-from-explained-by-science world.<br />This is a well written book by an author who apparently had a woderful sense of humor. His admonition to those who engage in various Wiccan rituals to expect misunderstanding if they wear hooded garments, flash knives, and start fires in public parks as part of a religious ceremony made me laugh.	2000-12-17

Justin de Quincy, the likeable hero in CRUEL AS THE GRAVE, is the sleuth fashioned by Sharon Kay Penman in her first mystery novel THE QUEEN'S MAN. Penman has written a number of non-mystery works of historical fiction and set them in the 12th and early 13th Centuries in England. In her author's note in CRUEL AS THE GRAVE, she says she will remain happy as long as she can write about Queen Eleanor of Aquataine. And, I as the reader will be happy as long as I can read about Queen Eleanor, the grandmother of European royalty.<br />Justin de Quincy works for Queen Eleanor, wife of Henry II (deceased) and mother of King Richard and his brother John. CRUEL AS THE GRAVE is set in 1193. King Richard is being held hostage (for an enormous ransom) by the German Emperor, following his capture enroute home from the Holy Land and the First Crusade. In Richard's absence, brother John covets the throne to the point of entertaining thoughts of treason. Eleanor wishes to preserve the throne for son Richard, and prevent John from committing an act that will land him in the Tower. She calls on De Quincy to help her in her efforts to deal with her family problems.<br />In the hours when he isn't serving the Queen, De Quincy is frequently called upon to help various common folk in the Cheapside neighborhood where he keeps a room. In CRUEL AS THE GRAVE, a merchant's sons have become implicated in the death of a young woman from Wales and De Quincy is asked to help exonerate the boys.<br />I find the storyline in CRUEL AS THE GRAVE interesting because Penman explores the psychological effects of parental love or lack thereof with a great deal of honesty. And, she has done a credible job of contrasting Queen Eleanor's difficulties with her two conflicted offspring, with the tortured relationship of the merchant father and his two sons. In the background hovers De Quincy's own questionable relationship with his father.<br />I find De Quincy an incredibly likeable hero and I want to know him better.

THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINAL PLANTS by Andrew Chevallier is a relatively comprehensive source of information about herbal uses for healing.  This is not the most recent volume by this author, however.  The 2000 version is more comprehensive and includes the most current information about research associated with herbal medicinal uses.<br />A less expensive and highly useful book on herbs and their uses is available from Rodale, entitled, ILLUSTRATED ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HERBS.  The Rodale book includes information missing from this version of Chevallier's book concerning negative effectives of herbs including accidental poisoning owing to misuse or problems with plant identification. Also, Rodale has been the the organic growing business for several decades and offers information about plant horticulture.  Chevallier's book is better illustrated, and filled with many colorful photographs but relatively less text (ratio of 1:4 pages for each item).<br />Unlike Ody's book, THE COMPLETE MEDICAL HERBAL, the Chevallier book contains information about native American herbs such as Cimicifuga Racemosa (Squawroot, Black Cohash).  THE COMPLETE BOOK OF HERBS by Leslie Bremmness does not contain the comprehensive coverage of medicinal uses, but it does provide much information about medicinal and other uses such as pot pourri and sachet making, paper making, and food preparation.	2000-12-10

With the wide selection of books on herbal uses confronting the average herbalist or curious reader, how is one to choose which resource is best?  The answer is that it is impossible to use only one resource.  Chevallier's books come close to being the one resource to use for employing herbs for medicinal purposes, but because the misuse of herbs can be deadly, I rely on a variety of material and crossreference my applications. In other words, if anyone says an herb has proved poisonous, I am careful. ....<br />ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HERBAL MEDICINE (EHM) by Andrew Chevallier is an update of his book THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINAL PLANTS (EMP).  EHM covers most of the same plants as EMP, but contains more up-to-date information from various sources conducting research on the properties and uses of herbs, including herbal systems in other parts of the world such as the U.K. and Germany, (i.e. not exclusively reliant on the actions of the FDA or USDA for all it's information).<br />EHM, as did EMP before it, includes one of the largest selections of plants for medicinal uses.  Not all the plants are botonacally speaking &quot;herbs.&quot; Black Cherry, for example, is a tree, but like many other trees has constituent parts that may be used for medicinal purposes, and therefore viewed as an &quot;herbal&quot; remedy for certain conditions (chronic dry, irritable coughs!!)--or kill you if you ingest an excess. ....<br />EHM is not much concerned with the manufacture of floral sachets or assembly of ingredients for pot pourri, or how to lay out your herbal garden for that matter. In fact, my suspician is that the average EHM reader will probably consult the health food store for herbal items, and not grow herbs in the back yard or try to harvest them in the nearest park.  ....	2000-12-10

Pamela Harper's new book TIME-TESTED PLANTS is beautiful, and a gift to those who garden in USDA Zone 8.  Ms Harper, originally a native of the U.K., has proved that we can have comparable gardens in the States, and not just in the Pacific Northwest. I first discovered Ms Harper a few years ago when she co-authored a book with Frank McGourty, a New England writer, on PERENNIALS. Of course, I wanted McGourty's New England garden, and tried my best in the Coastal Virginia heat to grow Delphiniams, Phlox, Bee Balm, and other cold winter, mild summer plants, all of which succumbed to one thing or another, or were so destroyed by powdery mildew that I had to uproot them.<br />Okay, I should have followed Ms. Harper's example, and recognized sooner rather than later that things work out a lot better if you grow plants in Tidewater Virginia that like the coastal climate. Ms. Harper has done exactly that, and her thirty years in a four-season garden shows just what can be done in Virginia or any Zone 8 location across the country with hot summers, mild winters, and lots of humidity.<br />Beginning with Spring, which is probably the high season in most Southern gardens, Ms. Harper covers bulbs and flowering spring bushes which do exceedingly well in Tidewater Virginia.  Shown in one of her many lovely photographs of her own garden are Leucojum (summer snowflake) and heirloom Narcissus 'Sir Watkin' growing happily side by side under a spreading branch of Corylopsis sinensis at the edge of a wood-bark mulched path (she has a very large work space).<br />Ms Harper moves on through the year and we see Hydrangea vines climbing very tall pine trees, and other vines climbing over cedar tree stumps, old buildings, or even rose bushes (Clematis). She reveals which types of vines, roses, and other perennials have served her needs best in each season.  She explains the strategy of successive planting, the uses of hardy and tender bulbs year-round, and the concept of creating understories (layers of plants growing under each other as is found in nature--think of the tropics).  Her book includes sections on annuals, grasses and other plants, shrubs, and trees.<br />The book is large, glossy, slippery and unwieldy, so you probably won't read it in bed.  It has plenty of text, so you will want to read it, as well as look at the many beautiful photographs.

Bowles book, MY GARDEN IN SUMMER, is part of a several part series of books he wrote describing his garden at Myddelton England during his tenure in the early part of the 20th Century.<br />I bought this book because I enjoyed books written by Beverly Nichols, an English writer who moved to the countryside after WWII and rebuilt the garden surrounding an old house. Nichols has the help of an excentric gardener, and all sorts of adventures with his cats and kooky maiden neighbors. I thought Mr. Bowles would prove to be another Brit gardener with a wry sense of humour but he is not -- at least in this book.<br />I am also a fan of Elizabeth Lawrence, a horticulturist with the N.C. State government who practiced her craft in the latter part of the 20th Century, beginning in the 1940s.  Ms Lawrence referred to Mr. Bowles books in her own books. I love Ms. Lawrence writing because she not only provides the scientific particulars of each plant, she shares the gardening experiences relayed to her via her correspondance -- with Mr. Howdyshel in Ohio and gardeners in other parts of the country. Ms. Lawrence  also provides the reader with many anectdotal bits about the plants, as well as the history of the plant.  Ms. Lawrence is factual, sometimes amusing though not funny, and I find her books entertaining.<br />If MY GARDEN IN SUMMER is a fair sample of Mr. Bowles writing, his book will appeal to no one but the avid historical garden enthusiast with an in-depth knowledge of plants and curiostity about another gardener's experiences with various plants at different times in the last century.  Or, someone who intends to visit Myddleton Garden in England, or has visited it might enjoy the book.  Being able to see the real thing often helps, and the gardens are being restored--probably why the book was republished.<br />Mr. Bowles book contains a dozen or so black and white photos of mixed quality.  For some reason, about half of them appear in the section he wrote on sedums and succulents. One photo in particular is very pretty, showing a long terrace with about 30-40 pots of various succulents.  I'd like a blow-up of that photograph for it's aesthetic properties.  You won't be able to identify many of the succulents in the pots, however.<br />An appendix in the back of the book provides the reader with the current names of the plants Mr. Bowles discusses.  In spite of this update, I found the sections of greatest interest to me a bit deficient. On my next visit to England, I will visit Myddleton Garden, and then I'll reread the book -- or sections of it. That should help me better appreciate it.edums and succulents.

In his book HEREDITARY WITCHCRAFT, Raven Grimassi reveals his family's secrets about the ancient religion inherited from  Italian ancestors and known as &quot;The Way of the Strega&quot; or Italian witchcraft. Grimassi says his purpose in recording these family practices is to ensure they will not be lost to future generations.<br />Grimassi connects his family religion to the ancient Celtic  religion of Europe which existed before the advent of patriarchial relgions from the east (Judaism, Christianity, Moslem). The old religion (La Vecchia Religione) was pantheistic and contained numerous gods and goddesses -- many known to those who study what moderns call Roman and Greek myths. The most important of the Goddesses was Diana the Queen of the fairies or witches and her consort Lucifer the God of Light. Grimassi says  the true characteristics of Diana and Lucifer were distorted by those who sought to make the old religion appear evil.<br />Grimassi says his family religion is tied to the people known as the Etruscans, who once inhabited the land known as Tuscany.  Many old relics from these times can be found in museums all over the world, and some artifacts have been handed on through families.<br />Although Grimassi bases much of his book on the oral stories and practices passed on to him by family members, he also refers to numerous texts about witchcraft and the old religion written by by Leland, Groves, and Frazier, and others. A bibliography is included for additional reading.	2000-11-25

THE FALCONER AND THE FACE OF GOD is a quick read, and a good paperback to carry in a suitcase for reading while you wait -- if your eyes can take the teeney type.  I'm pretty nearsighted so I had no problem reading the text, but it might be difficult to see without an itty-bitty book light.  Undoubtedly, the hardcover has larger type but it will weigh more, and this is the kind of book I like to take along on a trip and toss out after I read it.<br />Ian Morson is in the process claiming a &quot;series space&quot; between Cadfael (Ellis Peters, mid-1100's, Shrewsbury) and Archer (Candace Robb, mid-1300's, York). His writing is adequate. His plot is reasonable and his character development sparse.  His attention to detail is ample given the brevity of this text.<br />Morson's protagonist is Falconer is a regent at Oxford in the mid-1200s, during the latter days of the incredibly long reign of Henry III, the great-grandson of Matilda and father of Edward the hammer who conquered Scotland. The Falconer solves crimes in the little city of Oxford. He has been described as a Middle-Ages Morse on the book jacket but he's not that good--yet.<br />In FALCONER AND THE FACE OF GOD, a troupe of jongleurs not unlike the crew that stages the play in Hamlet arrives in Oxford in time to present a Christmas play covering everything from Creation to the death of Christ. Given the leading actor, a golden-haired fellow named de Askeles, is a despicable if semi-educated cur, fatal things are bound to happen and they do. Before long, the Falconer finds himself involved with two mysterious deaths which he solves just in time for the New Year.	2000-11-25

I have always appreciated Schama's entertaining and instructive writing as well as his meticulous attention to historical detail. However, A HISTORY OF BRITAIN is NOT of the caliber of his other books about European history including CITIZENS, EMBARASSEMENT OF RICHES, or PATRIOTS. In the past, Schama's books have offered a wealth of information about the lives of common folk and the times in which they lived. Not so this book, which is nothing more than a pathetic imitation of the series Alison Weir has been writing about British royalty.<br />At first glance the book appears to be a survey text for use in junior high school as there is nothing challenging about the text.  Although the book has been advertised as &quot;covering the history of Britain from 3500 B.C. to 1603 A.D.&quot; the first 4500  years are covered in 60 odd pages.  By the second chapter, we are at the Norman invasion. Probably the most irritating feature of the book is the lack of a comprehensive geneology chart of the British royalty which seems to be it's main focus.<br />This glossy volume was apparently created as a complement to the History Channel show of the same name as it contains many of same illustrations, portraits and maps.  The History Channel version of the story will undoubtedly become a DVD and the book will probably prove useful for following up something you note from the tv show as it contains a pretty good bibiliography.	2000-11-23

A few years ago I became interested in the difficulties in the former Yugoslavia--now Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, and a few other entities.  After reading a number of contemporary works about the causes of past and current conflicts in the Balkans, I decided none of the authors agreed on every point or many points for that matter, and most seemed a bit biased in their reporting and interpretation of events, probably owing to their inability to attend to the terrible events of the last century and not choose sides.<br />THE EARLY MEDIEVAL BALKANS is the most objective work available  about what really happened all those years ago when the Byzantine Empire ruled what is now known as the Balkans, and Serbs, Croatians, Ottoman Turks, and others migrated and/or invaded and settled the area the Italian Romans called Illyria.<br />The book is part of a two-part work covering the Middle Ages in the Balkans.  Part I THE EARLY MEDIEVAL BALKANS includes a critical survey of the area from the Sixth to the late Twelfth Century. Part II THE LATE MEDIEVAL BALKANS covers the period from the late Twelfth Century until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in the 14th Century.  Fine was a Professor of History at the University of Michigan for a number of years, and his work is incredibly scholarly. He has been considered the leading expert in the world on this topic by his colleagues.<br />I came away from the work with two impressions.  The first is that the various ethnic groups who inhabited or invaded the Balkans (and there were so many one loses count after awhile as they migrate or remigrate over and over) were so thoroughly mixed during the Middle Ages that the indigenous tribe, whatever that was, must have disappeared thousands of years ago.  The second fact I deduced from Dr. Fine's work is that most if not all the animosity between groups today probably has a basis in religious conflict. Given that the three major religions involved -- Roman Catholic, Orthodox Serb, and Muslim advocate love as an organizing principle, one has to wonder what went wrong.<br />I gave this book 4 stars because it is difficult to read.

John Keahey has written a lovely little travelog of his attempt to follow in the footsteps of George Gissing and explore a seldom visited (by Americans) part of Italy's boot, the heel, arch and toe. Gissing was a writer-comtemporary of H.G. Wells and Conan Doyle, and though he is not as well known today as Wells and Doyle, he was considered an important author in his own time. Like Henry James and Edith Warton and other Anglos from America and England, Gissing traveled though Italy and recorded what he experienced.<br />Keahey should probably be compared to PILLARS OF HERCULES author Paul Theroux as he writes currently, and has covered a part of the Mediterranean Theroux passed through and wrote about.  Theroux wrote a copious and much longer book (and I recommend it to anyone interested in the Mediterranean), and has a more pragmatic and sceptical outlook. Keahey has written a short, sweet, and romantic book about a place he seems genuinely fond of and not terribly familiar with, but willing to learn about. I suppose if one is reading before bedtime, Keahey's book may be more enjoyable, but Theroux's book may be closer to the truth.<br />Keahey's book is a diary of his travels and therefore a bit limited (Theroux actually links up with individuals living in various places and queries them about the local history, etc.).  He also seems more focused on the Greek heritage of the area than the Phoenician, Roman, Norman, or Turkish, though he does make reference to Spartacus in one section. A number of decisive battles were fought in the lower part of the boot, particularly by the Romans, and those battles and much other history is overlooked, but Keahey essentially suceeds in doing what he set out to do, recreate Gissing's trip and see the sights he saw 100 years earlier.	2000-11-19

Those fascinated with herbal remedies, Medieval times, and quick mystery reads (at the airport, on the plane) will probably enjoy this little book. Candace Robb's series (APOTHECARY ROSE is the first installment) features the exploits of Owen Archer spy-sleuth, and is comparable to Ellis Peters Cadfael series as both heros are Welsh, and ex-warriors with knowledge of herbal healing. Both series take place in the Middle Ages, though Cadfael lived in the mid 1100s and Archer in the mid 1300s.<br />Peters plot development is much stronger.  Her books could be read out of order as the plots stand on their own, but the reader will miss a few insights and not &quot;get&quot; some insider information if s/he reads them out of order. Peters writing is more deft. Her mystery books always have three plots going on at one time--a main plot and two subplots. Robb has one plot with a few twists, but she spends much more time in the first novel building up her characters--which I think pays off somewhat in later books in the series. However, I made the mistake of reading another book in the series first and it spoiled some of the plot in APOTHECARY ROSE so I recommend you read this one first.<br />Peters had an advantage as she was actually Welsh and understood the importance of being Welsh which she cleverly worked into every one of her stories. She was also an expert on the history of the time frame she used for Cadfael (wrote history under the name Edith Pargeter) while Robb apparently did most of her historical research for this book.<br />Robb is a novelist and her character development is quite good. However, the book is too short for it's complicated characters. APOTHECARY ROSE should have been 500 pages long so Robb had time to fully develop the storyline and characters.	2000-11-19

I have read most of Simon Schama's published works, and he is one of my favorite historians.  His books range from the long to the short, from the survey text to the reseach tome.  PATRIOTS AND LIBERATORS is a long research tome.  The book contains 750 pages covering the years 1780s-1813 -- a period marked by the rise and fall of the Dutch Republic. A long bibliography and section of endnotes follows the text.<br />Readers of CITIZENS or AN EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES may not enjoy PATRIOTS quite as much as either of Schama's earlier books because it contains little joy. In CITIZENS, the French Revolution begins on a somewhat inspirational note, and though it is soon followed by a Reign of Terror, the rise of Napoleon restores some hope. In PATRIOTS, Schama continues the tale begun in CITIZENS, but the French Reign of Terror and Napoleon's exploits are viewed from the unhappy perspective of the Dutch.<br />While the French Revolution has sometimes been depicted as colorful, horrendous, and/or chilling, and Napoleons's exploits are often glorified with blue-white-red cockades as well as land and sea battles, the Netherlands knew only deprivation, destruction, and death at the hands of the French. And, although PATRIOTS begins at a time when the Dutch still enjoyed a bit of the prosperity depicted in RICHES, by the battle of Waterloo, economic conditions in the Netherlands were terrible.<br />Napoleon extracted every drop of wealth from every citizen of the Netherlands to finance his military exploits against other European powers. Although the Dutch originally established their own Republican government, it soon became a puppet of Napoleon. In the end, the Republic of the Netherlands was destroyed by the struggles of the European superpowers.<br />If you like history about the Napoleonic era, you will probably enjoy this book. If you are of Dutch descent, and want to gain a little insight into your ancestors experiences of ethnic cleansing and a holocaust during the early 1800s, this book will prove interesting and informative.arly 1800s, this book will prove interesting and informative.	2000-11-08

I don't know why any woman of a &quot;certain age&quot; wouldn't find this book entertaining.  What's not to like about an author who tells you that eating chocholate and steak are good for you.  I knew if I searched long enough I'd find someone who would encourage me to behave the way I want to.<br />Now is the time to have your second childhood.  Now is the time to enjoy.  After all, what do you have to lose? Not much as it turns out.  I still don't think of myself as a crone. The term conjures up an image of a little old stooped woman with a crooked back, a long nose, pendulous ears and other body parts and a chin that points upward.  Well, I'm not there yet, but as one part of me and then another malfunctions, I say, what do you have to lose.<br />Morrison points the way to enjoying life after 50.  All those years of dieting so that you could stay rail thin, and now the scientists are actually saying women with a little weight are in better shape (bone-wise and maybe otherwise too, who knows what the guys will uncover tomorrow). And leafy vegetables, to heck with them, I'm for eating steak and tomatoes two days a week and chocolate the rest of the time.<br />And hot flashes.  Why they can be beneficial.  Clears out the pores. Drives blind dates away from the front door. Keeps you warm and toasty on those cold winter mornings while others freeze. Okay, it's a little tough on hot days, but hey, it can save you bucks on a sauna.  And, there are non-HRT remedies you can use.<br />Science moves on.  Since Ms. Morrison wrote her book, the boys and girls in white have discovered that too much roughage can be bad for women, so some of her recommendations for bulking up (and that's not in the muscle sense) may be wrong.  However, this just proves the point, that no matter what you do, you're going to die, and you'd better make the most of the time remaining.  I don't know about you, but I'm on my way to visit Lady Godiva.	2000-11-05

No matter how hard I search, I've yet to find the &quot;perfect&quot; book on herb use and herb growing. This book isn't perfect, but it does have some real strengths.<br />Rodale's ILLUSTRATED ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HERBS is organized in a strange way--everything, and I mean everything--falls into  alphabetical order. For example, &quot;Gardening with Herbs falls between &quot;Foxgloves&quot; and &quot;Garlic&quot; and &quot;Growing Herbs&quot; falls between &quot;Grindellia&quot; and &quot;Hawthorn.&quot;<br />The book is printed on semi-gloss paper so it will stand up to use and not crumble in a few years. Each entry contains line drawing illustrations and a few sections of the book are highlighted with color photos.<br />The plant profiles are succinct, covering topics such as 'history', 'cultivation' and 'uses.' Many entries contain material from other sources such as Maud Grieves' A MODERN HERBAL Vols. 1-2. Some information is repeated without attribution or verification. I always find &quot;They say&quot; and &quot;It is thought&quot; offputting, while I appreciate direct citations of which there are many in this book.<br />THE ENCYCLOPEDIA covers some topics not readily found in other books. The most useful of these is a compendium discussing the &quot;Dangers of Herbs&quot; (located between &quot;Dandelion&quot; and &quot;Deadly Nightshade.&quot;  The editors have compiled the FDA listing of &quot;tricky&quot; herbs (could kill or cure depending on use) from PREVENTION magazine, as well as similar ratings from James Duke's CRC HANDBOOK OF MEDICINAL HERBS, Jean Rose's HERBS AND THINGS, and Varro Tyler's THE HONEST HERBAL.  You realize on reading this section that everything is relative.<br />The biggest problem with the misuse of herbal remedies is the misclassification of plants by the practicioner.  To be an herbal healer one simply must understand botany. The second biggest problem is conflicting information about what a plant will or will not do based on singular accounts (which could be the result of a misclassification of plants or a misapplication of the plant extract). The third problem is idiosyncratic plant and human interaction. One man's poison can be another man's elixer. As with synthetic drugs, each individual has a unique chemical compostion and the herb in question may or may not be effective, or in some cases may provoke an allergy.  Of course, there are some herbs that are downright deadly as every mystery reader knows.<br />This wouldn't be a Rodale book with out a section on &quot;Pests&quot; and &quot;Pest Control&quot; or the synergistic and conflicting effects of various plant combinations in the garden.

I first discovered Andrea Barrett when I read one of the short stories<br />in her collection SHIP FEVER, entitled &quot;The Behaviour of the<br />Hawkweeds&quot; in BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES. ...<br />In her other tales<br />in this collection, Barret explores experiences and perspecives associated<br />with science and medicine in the 19th century. One tale &quot;Sorache&quot;<br />describes the terrible consequences of a treatment for altitude sickness on<br />a pregnant tourist.  In &quot;Birds With No Feet&quot; a young naturalist<br />realizes his love of nature and his scientific exploits are on a deadly<br />collision.<br />My second favorite story (after Hawkweeds) is the eponymous<br />tale &quot;Ship Fever.&quot; I could relate to this tale because my great-<br />grandmother Anna Mary immigrated from Genderalden Bavaria in the 1850s to<br />Chicago, where the members of her family were struck down by Cholera. Of her<br />family--father, mother, four brothers and herself--only Anna Mary and<br />one brother survived. In &quot;Ship Fever&quot; Barrett recounts the<br />terrible effects of Cholera on the immigrant ships....<br />These are wonderful<br />and moving stories.

I'm a fan of Lorrie Moore's stories, which I've read over the years in various forms including the BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES series.  Several of the stories in BIRDS OF AMERICA were published elsewhere, including &quot;Which is More Than I Can Say About Some People&quot;, &quot;Real Estate&quot; and &quot;People Like That Are the Only People Here&quot; all of which apeared in BASS. It's nice to have these stories and others collected together in one volume.<br />Ms Moore's tales force the reader to see life from the perspective of one who is suffering loneliness, heartbreak owing to loss, or sadness at missed chances.  In her story &quot;People Like That Are the Only People Here&quot; -- which she dedicated to her son (in BASS 1999)-- Ms Moore tells the story of a young mother who must submit her baby to the Pediatircs Oncology ward. Even after reading her story, I have only a small appreciation of the incredible suffering of the parents and child.<br />&quot;Which is More Than I Can Say About Some People&quot; hits closer to home for me. A young woman and her mother find a new connection over the Blarney Stone in Ireland. The daughter comes to appreciate her mother's courage in the face of adversity, and discovers she may courage too.<br />In &quot;Agnes of Iowa&quot; a young woman who cannot fit in well in her own hometown travels to New York to begin a new life.  &quot;Iowa&quot; snorts one New Yorker.  &quot;Here we spell it OHIO.&quot;  Agnes returns to Iowa to marry a realtor 12 years her senior and begin again.<br />Lorrie Moore's plots are not complicated, but her characters are memorable.	2000-10-30

When I found this book in the Amazon book store, I wondered if it was yet another autobiography by an English professor in a publish or perish bind at an obscure college, a New York off-off broadway author, or a BOBO with bucks restoring a mansion somewhere.  WOW! what a pleasant surprise! HONEY AND ASHES by Canadian Janice Kulyk Keefer is as powerful as A BRIDGE ON THE DRINA, A WOMAN IN AMBER, SHATTERED SELVES, OR THE HAUNTED LAND. Don't they give out awards in Canada?<br />Kulyk-Keefer is Canadian of Ukrainian-Polish descent. (Keefer is her husband's last name.)  She says the feeling of never &quot;fitting in&quot; with her Anglo-Canadian neighbors and classmates as a child inspired her as an adult to search out her own roots, thinking this might point her toward her &quot;real&quot; identity and her &quot;real&quot; home.<br />As part of the effort to constuct her &quot;real&quot; identity, she traces the geneology of her family, interviews the surviving members and others who knew them, and undertakes a difficult journey to the village of her mother's birth in the Ukraine. Since her father was of Polish descent, she visits her last known relatives in Poland on her way back from her mother's village. This may all sound fairly straightforward, but I have seldom seen such elegant and beautiful prose coupled with such tenacious research.  The result is the resolution of a personal mystery, or at the least, the beginning of knowledge.<br />Anyone who has ever poured over old letters; dug through photo albums and other family treasures; searched Census, administrative, and other records; struggled with bureacrats to travel to a remote location will appreciate Ms. Keefer's efforts. She is a student of the history of her parent's bloody homeland. She is the ethnographer who waits with great patience while an old woman recalls with extreme pain and difficulty the day the Nazis shot many of her relatives, and the day the Russians collected the rest and sent them to the Gulag. She is the scholar pouring over old mouldering papers and notes in the archives.  And above all, she is the poet who casts her story into a tale laden with rich metaphor....<br />&quot;Are we, in the end only what we can remember?

She begins with a simple premise--women have needs different from men.  Women, cannot escape the calendar, the seasons, and nature in general. Men don't experience menses, bear children, or go through menopause. Herbs that ease the pain women know first hand can only be seen as Goddess-sends if you will.<br />Because men and women are different, not all the herbs that work for men will work for women--and vice versa.  Unfortunately, not too many &quot;herbalists&quot; clearly acknowledge this in their various books. In many herbal books and manuals you have to dig to find the information specific for age and sex, but Gladstar has arranged the female part in logical categories associated with the various phases of a woman's life.<br />For example, Black Cohash (Cimicifuga Racemosa), Linseed oil, and Isoflavins contain phytoestrogens and are used in Europe to alleviate the symtoms of menopause. Since the side effects of some of the regularly prescribed synthetic estrogens derived from mare's urine are not only acquired in despicable ways (ask PETA) but are dangerous to your health (don't belive me? read the little piece of paper that comes with your prescription) you might consider alternatives. I have and am here to say that some of the unhappy consequences I experienced from the over-the-counter drug are a thing of the past.<br />As part of my Master's Degree program (I am a sociologist-demographer), I studied mortality, morbidity, and biostatistics at Georgetown University and learned how to read biomedical research. I have maintained a personal interest in, and spent the last 30 years keeping up with, medical studies about women's issues.  So, I am not ignorant of the strengths and shortcomings of various drugs used to deal with women's &quot;complaints.&quot;  The bad news is this--all synthetic drugs have bad side effects.  Sometimes they are worse than what ails you. Synthetics simply aren't as good as the original, and as Gladstar points out, you even have to be careful where the original is involved.<br />For example, the current evidence for HRT with estrogens made from mare's urine is conflicted. Unfortunately, for ages and ages, males were the only medical subjects in scientific studies.  So, it will take awhile to find out just how effective and/or damaging therapies like HRT are. In the interim, my daughter's midwife recommended herbs known to women through the ages and I am taking these to deal with the symptoms of menopause.<br />Ms. Gladstar discusses the clinical reseach associated with each of the herbs listed in her book, including those of interest to me at this phase in my life.  Thank goodness, she doesn't limit herself to research conducted in the U.S. And, unlike the European herbalists, she includes herbs known and used by American Indian women.<br />I have a number of favorites, many I've known about since I was a child. I will never forget discovering the cure for warts from a little classmate in 4th grade.  I rushed home to tell my mother because my sister suffered from warts (all over her hands).  Mom had tried everything, but this procedure worked.  I tried it years later on a horse that broke out with warts all over his body--they are caused by a virus--and he survived the virus and lost all his warts. My little friend was only nine years old, and had an amazing knowledge of home remedies.

This is a fun book.  I don't know if the spells work because I haven't tried any yet, but I told my husband if he crossed my path I was going to turn him into a frog, to which he replied &quot;Ribbet.&quot;<br />Okay, okay, Mr. Cunningham doesn't recommend using magic in that way, but I can see from reading the various concoctions and spells that many of these things work because they work. And, just in case, I do have prophylactic holly trees and bushes planted around my house, and I swear the catnip I planted for my cat has helped us form a psychic bond, and &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; well that's a whole story unto itself.<br />If you write or read magical realism, want to learn more about magical practices, or are just curious, you will enjoy this book.  Cunningham's entries are illustrated with very accurate pen drawings of the herbs. The book includes an annotated bibliography which is relatively comprehensive. Many works by respected social scientists are included.<br />I disagree with Cunningham's assessment of Robert Groves' &quot;White Goddess&quot; or his take on Sir James Frazier's &quot;Golden Bough&quot; but I agree that a good way to learn about the old ways is to read material written by churchmen who pointed out in great detail the nefarious ways of sin. The best book on Cunningham's list for this purpose is Phillip Schmidt's &quot;Superstition and Magic.&quot; Schmidt was a Jesuit who attemted to show the horrors of the occult and included much detail on herbal lore in his book.	2000-10-24

A few years ago, I became a professional social scientist.  As such, I became tangled in the beginning...what is truth?  I never figured it out, but I had to go to work and earn a living so I took up the viewpoint that seemed most reasonable --material empiricism -- and began documenting my version of truth and getting it published.<br />In DEAD CERTAINTIES (UNWARRENTED SPECULATION),  Simon Schama raises important questions about the truth of history. How do historians know what really happened?  Well the truth is, they don't.  At best, our reconstructions of the past are partial truths.  They are partial truths because no one is free from prejudice.  They are partial truths, because try as we might to be objective, we cannot help but place our own interpretation on &quot;facts.&quot; They are partial truths because eye witnesses to history seldom know all the &quot;facts.&quot;  They are partial truths because language is alive and word meanings change over time.  And, they are partial truths because eye witnesses often lie.<br />What really happened in the past times?  In recent years, new historical practicioners have begun to revisit primary materials and attempt to piece together their version of what these documents tell them.  This revisionist history has it's supporters, but in the end, who is to say their interpretations are free of bias and agenda?<br />In DEAD CERTAINTIES Schama revisits the story of Wolfe the British hero of the 1700's on the 'Heights of Abraham' in Canada.  Probably every Canadian school child of my generation, plus a few Americans, remembers the words, &quot;Wolfe the dauntless hero came and planted firm Britannia's flag on Canada's fair domain.&quot; I don't know if it's still politically correct to sing these words in Canada, but I believe at one time they were the words to the national anthem.<br />Everyone who's ever taken a course in art has probably seen a photograph of Benjamin West's monumental painting  &quot;The Death of General Wolfe.&quot;  It is a magnificent painting of a beautiful young man in the last agony of life, looking toward a distant and dramatic horizon.  The painting has inspired generations of Canadians to national patriotism. The painting supposedly depicts the last hour of General Wolfe. Schama says, &quot;Not so fast.&quot;  He then goes on to tell as best he can given the material at hand, what he believes happened on that fateful day when General Wolfe met his maker (maybe he did, maybe he didn't).<br />The book also contains a second &quot;story&quot; about a murder that took place in New England in the last century.  This &quot;story&quot; reads like a detective fiction.  Schama demonstrates though his own research who he thinks the real killer was. It is an excellent read even if you don't like history.<br />This book sheds a little light on historiography--how historians have framed history in the past and how they go about it today.

Laura Shaine Cunningham, a Jewish orphan, grows up in New York City<br />with two eccentric uncles.  All her young life, Laura pines for a place<br />in the country.  Finally, as a successful writer she manages to fulfill<br />her dream of owing an &quot;estate&quot; outside the city. Like most<br />transplants from the city to the countryside, Ms. Cunningham spends a<br />great deal of time lamenting the encroaching population growth that<br />threatens to overwhelm her bit of paradise.<br />I enjoyed this book<br />until Ms. Cunningham achieved her goal owning a bit of former<br />farmstead.  The early episodes involving her life with family members<br />in New York City are extremely funny.  After she moves away from the<br />city and her family, her book reads like every other BOBO story -- got<br />educated, got a career, got married, made money, bought a house, had<br />kids.  True, she does adopt two foreign-born children, and she does<br />eventually break up with her spouse, but these incidents are not fully<br />developed, and seem like tacked on bits to enlarge the book.<br />I liked<br />Ms.  Cunningham's writing enough to read other books, and I think for a<br />start I'll find the one she wrote abouther life with her two eccentric<br />uncles.  Her writing is much better when it's original and involves her<br />take on her own unique experiences as a child.  Her country life reads<br />like a watered down version of a cross beteen James Herriot and Beverly<br />Nichols (read their books, they're better, especially Herriot).<br />If<br />you're looking for gardening experiences and gardening philosopy read<br />Nollman's &quot;Why We Garden&quot; or books by Allen Lacey, Anne<br />Raver, or Joyce Mcgreevey -- all of them built gardens in rural or<br />semi-rural areas.	2000-10-17

This is a fact we mostly ignore as we go about our daily life.  One day, you wake up, and discover that within your own lifetime things have been permanently altered.<br />When John Muir made his &quot;Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf&quot; the U.S. was not as heavily populated as it is today, although much had changed from the time when European settlers first moved through the area he explored -- a path that stretched from Indianapolis Indiana to the Gulf just north of what is Tampa Florida today.<br />Muir moved South in the aftermath of the Civil War, so he encountered much unrest, unhappiness, and destruction along the way. He describes not only the flora and fauna he found but the condition of humans as they struggled to rebuild their lives.<br />He says, &quot;My plan was to simply to push on in a general southward direction by the wildest leafiest, and least trodden way I could find, promising the greatest extent of virgin forest.&quot; To a great extent, he was able to do that, however, he could not escape some of the realities of the world around him. For example, in Georgia, he encountered the graves of the dead, whom he says lay under a &quot;common single roof, supported on four posts as the cover of a well, as if rain and sunshine were not regarded as blessings.&quot;  A bit further he says, &quot;I wandered wearily from dune to dune sinking ankle deep in the sand, searching for a place to sleep beneath the tall flowers, free from the insects and snakes, and above all my fellow man.&quot;<br />Muir wonders at the teachings of those who call themselves God's emissaries, who fail to ask about God's intentions for nature. He says, &quot;It never seems to occur to these far-seeing teachers that Natures's object in making animals and plants might possibly be first of all the happiness of each one of them, not the creation of all for the happiness of one.  Why should man value himself as more that a small part of the one great unit of creation? And what creature of all that the Lord has taken the pains to make is not essential to the completeness of the unit--the cosmos?&quot;<br />Partly as a result of his writing, and the writing of other Naturalists, the National Park System came into being, and today, more trees grow on the East coast than grew in the late 1700s (American Revolution).

If you're a member of either group, you will love this collection of essays.<br />The book contains stories by the finest America naturalists including: John James Audubon, Liberty Hyde Bailey, John Burroughs, Rachel Carson, Annie Dillard, and Henry David Thoreau. Essays range in time from the 1600s in New England. &quot;Of the Beasts That Live on the Land&quot; (William Wood), to the 1700s in North Carolina &quot;Travels in North and South Carolina...&quot; (William Bartram), to the ramblings of Audubon in the 1800s in &quot;The Great Pine Swamp.&quot;  Henry David Thoreau's &quot;Walking&quot; is reproduced from THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY, June 1962, and John Muir's &quot;The Water-Ouzel&quot; from THE MOUNTAINS OF CALIFORNIA in 1894 is included.<br />Every part of the U.S. and every period since the settlement of the first English colony is covered in almost 500 pages.

At this time of the year, I am off to the local forests, parks, etc. with my dogs, to walk along and fill my lungs with hopefully clean air. The dogs and I like to kick up the leaves, and they sniff about a great deal, undoubtedly detecting one animal or another.  As I look up, I see the walnuts clinging to their mother branches, standing out against the sky as Thoreau said they would. Many nuts fall long after the leaves.<br />This is a lovely book, and the next best experience you can have to a long walk in the woods.  Bradley Dean, the Editor, could have called it &quot;A Walk in the Woods with Henry David Thoreau.&quot;  Thoreau sniffs, he tastes, he feels, he draws what he sees. And he invites the reader to do the same. Walden Forest and the surrounding countryside Thoreau knew are threatened, but some are trying to conserve what remains. Among other bits of information the reader can find in this book is how to join the crusade to save Waldon Forest.<br />Sadly, the American countryside Thoreau describes has been disappearing.  Even 50 years ago, small farms were the norm, and hedgerows and creeks between farms harbored all sorts of wild things.  Although DDT introduced after WWII had done a bit of damage to some of the wildlife, herbicides, pesticides, and huge commercial farms had not yet driven everything except a monocrop out of existence. One could walk along the country lane and find blackberries, chokeberries, cranberries, gooseberries, and blueberries in their many forms. Wild cherries and crabapples were abundant. Have you found crabapple jelly at the supermarket lately?  I had to send off to a mail order company to buy it.  Crabapples are native species, but they are in decline. Wild fruits we took for granted have been driven to the brink of extinction.<br />When I was in fourth grade, our teacher Mrs. Bryant took us to visit a brook that ran through our neighborhood. The brook was lined with a small forest, even though it backed up onto housing. There we found wild Trilliums and Mandrakes, signs of the Ovenbird, and a creek filled with Crawfish who scurried away when you moved the rocks that hid them. The creek was clear as glass, and we did not hesitate to drink the water--the thought we might become sick never entered our minds. A creek runs through my grandchildren's neighborhood, and it's lined with concrete where it doesn't run through a culvert--flood control to protect housing built where it ought not be built.<br />Thoreau writes beautifully, as everyone who ever read him knows. In &quot;Wild Fruits&quot; -- his last known work -- he describes the excursions he made into the woods, thickets, swamps, and fields during the last years of his short life (d. age 44).  The journal entries/essays cover the seasons of the year, and are arranged by type of fruit--for the most part.<br />Thoreau is humorous, thoughful, and instructive. In the section on autumn fruits, Thoreau describes his friend who suggested they wear the stick-tights acquired on their pantaloons on an afternoon walk until they fell off naturally.  His friend shows up a day or two later still coverd with little green seeds.<br />Thoreau is somewhat given to making political and philosophical comments, and he refers to the troubles in the bloody Kansas of the 1850s and other troubles associated with slavery.  But, he can make your heart sing when he describes the bluejay hammering a nutcase like a woodpecker as he estracts his supper, or the complexity of the Asclepia seed pod that launches it's silky parachutes on the wind.<br />Finally, he reminds us how easy it would be to leave the natural world entact where trees rise toward heaven like the pillars of a cathedral -- and refrain from building the man-made edifices to worship God that are so inferior to those Nature erected.g.

I did not enjoy this book and I am still trying to figure out why it was hyped by the critics and the media.  Perhaps this is a case of the &quot;Emperor's new clothes?&quot; Or, perhaps, even though I think I understand, and like, British literature, maybe I don't.<br />Freidrich von Hardenburg, a young university student known to his family as Fritz, falls in love with a 14-year old girl, the blonde Sophie van Kuhn.  This is an historical novel, and in &quot;olden&quot; times, couples fell in love at young ages. Romeo and Juliet were teenagers.<br />I did not object to the book because the heroine was a teenager, ignorant, ill-educated, and totally unsuitable for the literate poet protagonist (although I thought &quot;maybe it's all physical attraction&quot;,  &quot;maybe she's his muse&quot;).  She would have made a marriage partner comparable to the one Charles Dickens suffered, or Mr. Bennett in &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot;<br />But, young Sophie dies. End of story. No plot, no character development, no mise en scene, no imagery, no metaphors (that I could discern), no nothing -- except the praise of the critics and an award or two.  ????	2000-10-14

This is a nice book, and a pretty book and a good place to start if you want to know more about &quot;herbal&quot; remedies for various maladies and ailments.  Penelope Ody, the author, is an herbalist who lives and practices her craft in England.<br />Ms Ody provides a brief overview of the history of herbal medicine -- citing males like Pliny who had the advantage of education (ability to write) and the presence of mind to write about the herbal medical practices he witnessed in his age.  Herbal remedies have come from around the world and Ms Ody includes some information about Chinese, European, Greek &amp; Roman, American Indian, and other traditional practices. It would seem the availability of plant material determined what was used in herbal healing.  For example, North Ameican Indians used Joe Pye Weed while Europeans did not, simply because the plant is native to North America and did not exist in Europe until the 17th Century. However, Plantain was native to Europe, and was imported to America by the European settlers, as were a variety of other plants now considered pests.<br />&quot;Old Wives&quot; and other hands-on practicioners such as Shamans, medicine men, etc. actually discovered the efficacy of various plant parts -- many of them at the dawn of prehistory. This knowledge was eventually recorded, and the record keeper acquired the notarity of the discovery.  My favorite example is William Withering who discovered the medicinal properties of Foxglove when family members of one of his heart patients prepared a brew from the plant and administered it to the patient behind the doctor's back. Withering had been unable to help the fellow (can't you hear the family calling Withering a quack? ).  Withering subsequently began using a Foxglove extract -- digitalis -- to alleviate the symtoms of other heart patients.<br />Well, you may think you don't use medicinal herbal approaches, but if you've ever kept an Aloe plant in the kitchen so you could whack off a piece and extract the gel-like center to sooth a burn, drank orange juice or Rose hip tea for the Vitamin C,  sucked a Licorice or Eucalyptus drop to ease your sore throat, consumed Chamomile Tea for it's calming properties or Black Tea for it's antioxidant properties, you're an herbal practicioner.<br />Ody's book is informative, and more colorful than Mrs. Grieve's books &quot;A Modern Herbal&quot; Vols. I and II -- but not nearly as comprehensive. For example, I use Black Cohash and Ody does not refer to it at all, though it's a fairly well known herb derived from Cimicifuga Racemosa (Snakeroot) and has been noted by North American naturalists for years (may not be used in England).<br />Ody's book covers different material than that found in the &quot;Complete Book of Herbs&quot; by Lesley Bremnes, which is also not as comprehesive as Mrs Grieves books.  Bremnes book is very colorful and provides many uses for herbs other than healing (potpourri, sachets, wreaths, etc), plus gardening tips--not covered in either Grieves or Ody.<br />Probably the most useful part of Ms Ody's book is a section  where she demonstrates via colorful photos how to create tinctures, oils, extracts, poltices, and other healing applications derived from flowers, stems, leaves, roots, and bark of various plants.  She also lists side effects such as the tendency of some herbal extracts to cause the uterus to contract and others to cause dizzyness or vomiting if the wrong part of the plant is consumed.

This small volume (150 pages) contains a dozen or so essays on gardening, written by individuals who lived and worked during the 20th century. The writers include journalists (Katherine White), editors (Richardson Little Wright), novelists (Mabel Osgood Wright), radio/tv personalities (Thalassa Cruso), and others. Unless you're a long-time fan of gardening you will not recognize their names, however, these essays are as entertaining and useful as anything written lately.<br />I was reminded that I own a copy of &quot;Remembered Gardens&quot; because today I read an essay by Sydney Eddison in the December 2000 issue of &quot;Fine Gardening&quot; in which she mentioned this book as one of her all time favorites. Ms. Eddison is a garden writer who lives in Connecticut.  Because she has limited space in her office, she has had to thin her garden book collection as I have done. &quot;Remembered Gardens&quot; is one of the books we both kept.<br />The book is beautifully illustrated with colorful prints by the author Ferris Cook, who appears to work in a wood block medium. The essays are as relevant today as they were when first published. Each gardener &quot;expert&quot; shares the story of how she or he built a garden from scratch on an acre of clay or a rock ledge or some other difficult surface. The essays are relatively short, comparable to 'letters' written to an interested friend. Although this book is currently out-of-print, it is worth searching for in the used book market.	2000-10-08

Bobby Ward, a retired environmental scientist who now edits and writes books on gardening, has assembled a nice compendium on selected literature and folk lore associated with some of our most beloved flowers. He covers Daffodils (Wordsworth) and Pansies (that's for thoughts) and other familiar blossoms, as well as a few not so familiar plants.<br />My favorite essay is about the Honeysuckle, literally a flower from which one sucks honey. Also known as Woodbine, this little plant has over 180 species, primarily native to the Northern Hemisphere, but there is at least one that grows in England ... &quot;I know a place where the wild thyme blows, Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, Quite overcanopied with luscious Woodbine..&quot; where of Tatania the Queen of the Fairies sleeps. The Honeysuckle belongs to the genus &quot;Lonicera&quot; in the family &quot;Caprifoliaceae&quot; literally goat's leaves--probably because they loved to eat them.<br />We learn of the patron saints of gardeners, and specific flowers, like Saint John's Wort named for saints. The Crocus is the Queen, with it's many religious associations ranging from Lupercalia to Saint Valentines Day. Many poets and writers have created verse and prose to honor the little Crocus, harbinger of spring.<br />Mr. Ward used secondary material to develop his book, so he  perpetuates some myths -- pagans were not likely to have built fires to ward off witches and devils since Christians invented the latter long after the pagens came into being. If the local country folk built fires to ward off witches and devils they were practicing a 'Santaria' type religion (mixture of Christian and pagan beliefs).<br />Mr. Ward edited a book of essays by Elizabeth Lawrence entitled, &quot;A Garden of One's Own&quot; and is a fellow North Carolinian.  So I was quite surprised to see that he did not include her very fine book &quot;Through the Garden Gate&quot; in his bibliography.  Lawrence's book covers much of the same material found in Ward's book, and she wrote it some 20-30 years earlier.<br />All in all, this is a nice book, and since it brings together material from a variety of sources it's a good place to start if you're interested in the connections between flora, folk tales, English literature, and Latin names.same material found in Ward's book, and she wrote it some 20-30 years earlier.<br />All in all, this is a nice book, and since it brings together material from a variety of sources it's a good place to start if you're interested in the connections between flora, folk tales, English literature, and Latin names.	2000-10-08

It's no<br />surprise to me she's earned the Flannery O'Connor and PEN/Nelson<br />Algren awards. Like O'Conner before her, Nelson writes stories filled<br />with the offbeat, dysfunctional, and neurotic (the DSM III made the<br />term neurotic passe, but what else is there? ). And, like O'Connor,<br />Nelson has a finely tuned ear for dialogue, which she uses effectively<br />to portray the psychological makeup of her characters.<br />I can<br />understand why some people might find this book offputting. People who<br />grew up in relatively normal healthy homes where alcoholism and it's<br />attendent dysfunctional behavior weren't the norm might not believe<br />folks like the Mabies exist.  But, they do.<br />Scott Fitzgerald had an<br />alcohol problem and a wife Zelda some called zany and others called<br />crazy. He wrote about &quot;3:00 o'clock in the morning of the<br />long night of the soul.&quot; I think of him on those nights when I<br />wake up and the clock beside my bed says 2:46 a.m. I think about him<br />when I stumble down the stairs past the night lights placed at<br />critical junctures between my bedroom and the kitchen. I think about<br />him when I switch on the light and pick up a book to read.<br />Or,<br />sometimes I think about Benjamin Franklin, who said if you can't sleep<br />at night, get up, walk around and flap your arms a bit. Or maybe I<br />think about my brother who has suffered from an alcohol and drug<br />problem ever since he dropped out as a flower child in the sixties. Or,<br />maybe I think about other relatives and friends who've OD'd, died by<br />their own hand, or been in bizarre accidents while under the influence.<br /><br />From now on, I'll think about the Mabies--parents and children--up<br />at four a.m., falling over each other in the kitchen. It's easy to<br />describe Emily, Mona, and Winston as young adults in various stages of<br />arrested growth. Through the course of the book, however, each of them<br />makes an effort to improve. All three Mabie children are doing the best<br />they can.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who is in recovery,<br />knows someone in recovery, or works with people who are trying to get<br />sober.

In &quot;Intellectuals in the Middle Ages&quot; Jacques Le Goff explores the rise of intellectuals in Western Society. He says the Western medieval intellectual was born in the town. When towns expanded around the year 1000 A.D. individuals who could read and write and teach others to read and write were in great demand.<br />Reading and writing was something the clergy could do. Towns were often attached to monastaries or cathedrals, so the demand for instruction led some clergy to leave behind lives of contemplation as monks and undertake lives as mendicants (ad)ministering to the people. Over time, the church became more and more involved in commercial interests, and this growing involvement further fueled the demand for an educated class.<br />But the church controlled &quot;knowledge.&quot;  Early thinkers and teachers like Abelard, found themselves working within a theological framework.  The imposition of the theology on knowledge is known as scholasticism. Le Goff says scholasticism sowed the seeds of it's own destruction because it constrained rational thinking and therefore in time became outmoded in a rapidly developing capitalist society.<br />Many of the problems the church faced required scietific or rational thinking (such as figuring out a calander to schedule the celebration of Church holydays). In supporting these forms of thinking the church indirectly supported thought that was inimical to it's own existence.  However, the church moved very slowly, so intellectuals became more secular, and involved in the material world.<br />However, acquiring knowledge was an expensive proposition.  The secular scholar/teachers had to eat, cloth themselves, and find shelter.  They no longer had funding from the church to support themselves, let alone underwrite the poorer students. Many scholars associated with &quot;Princes&quot; who could offer them a rich life style as well as protection. Thus the acquistion of knowledge became something only the wealthy could afford.<br />So, as the Middle Ages waned, the mendicant intellectual and scholar, tending a flock of students comprised of both rich and poor students disappeared completely. Le Goff suggests the Renaissance scholars worked in glorious surroundings, usually in countryside villas where they owned large farms purchased with their own or inherited wealth.  LeGoff calls these Renaissance scholars Humanists. Interestingly, Renaissance scholars mostly studied and wrote about the common people with whom they avoided contact.<br />An interesting note, Latin was the language of the Renaissance scholars, but because these scholars were the only people who continued to use Latin, it was doomed as more and more Europeans spoke a vernacular language based on Latin (French, Italian, Spanish, etc.).<br />Le Goff suggests the fall of Constantinople in the 15th Century spurred scholars, particularly in Italy, to study all things Greek--language, architecture, etc.--which had been the basis of the Byzantine Empire. I had not made the connection between the fall of the Byzantine Empire and the Renaissance but it makes a great deal of sense. Many scholars and other professionals fled when the Byzantine Empire fell to the Turks. They would have carried a great deal of knowledge with them. After all, they did not call themselves Byzantines, they called themselves Roman.hy could afford.<br />So, as the Middle Ages waned, the mendicant intellectual and scholar, tending a flock of students comprised of both rich and poor students disappeared completely.

Nuala O'Faolain is a columnist with the Irish Times. To a certain extent she followed her journalist father's footsteps, but her climb was a bit more difficult. In addition to her struggles to become a writer, O'Faolain grew up a woman in the impoverished Ireland of the 40's and 50's.  Although her childhood in some ways was similar to those of Frank McCourt and Christie Brown, she had the added burden of being female.<br />Like Brown and McCourt, the family struggled with too many mouths to feed and an alcoholic parent. In her adult years, Nuala struggled with her own affliction with the disease of alcoholism. She managed to find recovery from alcoholism and pull her self up from an extremely low place. Her story of the rebuilding of her life is an inspiration to those suffering from alcoholism -- their own or that of a loved one.<br />O'Faolain's writing is not as lyrical as McCourt's nor as colorful as Brown's, but she tells a good tale. Her relating of the day-to-day interaction of her parents, as well as her own  relationships with her parents, lovers, friends, and others is honest, compelling and somewhat sad. Her description of Ireland is a million miles from the Hollywood version of the 1940s. I recommend this book to anyone who can't get enough of the &quot;old country.&quot;	2000-09-26

Sooner or later, we all face the prospect of losing a loved one. Often the death of a friend leads one to reflect on one's own mortality. Sometimes undertaking an arduous physical challenge helps alleviate the emotional pain following loss. Often the loss of someone dear leads to enormous changes in one's life.<br />Ann Linnea lost a good friend to breast cancer.  In a state of grief buried so deep she was not fully aware of it until she had completed a good part of her journey, she set out on an extraordinary trip kayaking around Lake Superior. She and her travel companion were subjected to incredible physical stress, and they experienced sublime beauty. By day, they paddled against the surf, in the rain and broiling sun, and through the treacherous debris of the coastline. Sometimes they paddled at night, where she saw &quot;dark lichen-covered boulders..illuminated by a full moon.&quot;<br />Like Pirsig in &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; Linnea alternately describes her evolving mental and emotional state and the intricacies of kayaking a long distance. &quot;I wore heavy-soled hiking boots, teal wind pants, yellow waterproof parka&quot;... she says.  And a moment later, &quot;The only other time in my life that I could remember feeling connected like this to the ancient spirit of a place was in 1988 on my second three-month camping trip to the desert southwest with my children.&quot;<br />By the end of her book, Linnea has successfully circumnavigated Lake Superior, found the perfect place to scatter the ashes of her dead friend, and made some life-affirming decisions about her own existence.	2000-09-25

If you're a serious herbalist, this is the dictionary.<br />Many herbs (leaves, roots, fruits) were used for medicinal purposes by traditional people, and plant extracts still make up a large share of the inventory of modern pharmacies. Owing to a virtual monopoly on plant sources, big pharmaceutical companies charge the average customer $$ (mucho dinero) for plant extracts our grandparents cultivated and harvested from their kitchen gardens for relatively little or no cost.<br />If you have the space, you might grow some herbs --especially those used for food.  Also, farmer's markets and community food co-ops are good sources.  Although I live in an urban area, a food co-op 5 blocks away carries many of the holistic medicines and herbal remedies I use--at much less cost than I would incur at the local grocery or health food store.

This is Vol.2. of the original book. The volume #'s are indicated but I did not read the description carefully, so I did notice the paperback version had been published in two volumes.<br />&quot;Modern Herbal&quot; contains much information about the &quot;old&quot; ways.  Traditional approaches may be dated according to some folks, but for many of us, they do not have the &quot;sell-by&quot; date which permeates modern society.  Many of the old remedies have never been subjected to the &quot;scientific&quot; testing of modern times or USDA approved.  However, the curative and/or prophylactic properties of herbal substances have been known for centuries, and information about their uses has been handed down from one woman to another. I have been fortunate because I have had relatives who knew the old ways, and passed them along. (Like passalong plants.)<br />And, while modern pharmaceutical companies will not tell you this, they are 1) using old methods--only now you must pay big bucks and buy the plant extract over the counter as a perscription drug -- for example, Valium is derived from the root of the Red Valerian, Digitalis from the Fox Glove, and Poppy juice--well--you can still buy that on the street--it's called heroine; 2) testing the properties of plants used in folk remedies and marketing the stuff as fast as they can--Echinacea, and Ginger for example.<br />So, read the information in this REFERENCE book and form your own opinions.	2000-09-22

Norman Cantor is considered an expert on the Middle Ages by his fellow  historical professionals. So, when I set out to learn more about this  period of history, I soon discovered his two works, &quot;Inventing the  Middle Ages&quot; and &quot;Civilizations of the Middle Ages&quot; were  required reading. Cantor's two companion books provide an update to the  1963 edition of  &quot;Civilizations...&quot;  The 1993  &quot;Civilizations...&quot;  tells the story of the Middle Ages (c. 500 -  c 1500 A.D.), while &quot;Inventing..&quot; it's companion piece provides  an historiography of the experts who worked in this field in the 20th  Century--according to Cantor.<br />My own bias is that I am a  sociologist/demographer (means I understand math) of the Feminist  tradition, so I tend have a different perspective. And, because I studied  Semiotics, as well as English and French structural anthropology, and had a  few Marxists professors along the way, I am aware of how tenuous all our  belief systems are..<br />All that said, you don't have to have a background  in history to get something out of this very long and detailed book. You  just have to like history and be really fond of reading about the Middle  Ages. The book interprets most of the major &quot;events&quot; of the  period, and contains both short and long lists of recommended readings in  the back.  Some of my favorites are missing (where is Braudel??), but  you'll discover many of them if you read some of the authors listed.<br />When  I'm reading history, I always look for the woman's angle, and buried though  it is in this book, Cantor does make reference to some interesting  anectdotal material concerning women. For example, he says on page 504,  that Fourteenth Century folks lived through a &quot;biomedical  holocaust&quot; as well as a severe economic depression (undoubtedly caused  by the Bubonic Plague that reached Europe via commercial travelers from the  East). As a result, these people turned to and derived comfort from what  anthropologists call &quot;magic.&quot; They practiced contagious magic  (touching relics of saints), penitential magic (went on pilgrimages),  consulted with astrologers, and (heaven forfend!!) may have  &quot;(illicitly) in some cases used witchcraft.&quot; (Women are not  mentioned, but they of course were the &quot;witches.&quot;)<br />Of course,  the female magic of the common folk was not approved of by the newly  educated upper class male population who are famous for starting the  Reformation and the Renaissance, so they initiated a long period of large  scale persecution began.  Cantor says, &quot;Theorists and scholars of the  younger generation of 1500 fastened on a vision of a reformed church that  would be as spiritual unmaterial, and ethical as possible.  That such a  puritanical church was far removed from demotic culture and the faith and  temperament of ordinary people did not seem to bother them......in early  sixteenth century Europe, whenever the reformers could gain the support of  governmental authorities, they actually carried out their antimagic  program, the elimination of what they regarded as the corrupt heritage of  the late medieval church.&quot; Cantor says people still disagree today the  appropriateness of this purge--which was mostly carried out by the new  Protestants in England and northern Europe.and derived comfort from what  anthropologists call &quot;magic.&quot; They practiced contagious magic  (touching relics of saints), penitential magic (went on pilgrimages),  consulted with astrologers, and (heaven forfend!!) may have  &quot;(illicitly) in some cases used witchcraft.&quot; (Women are not  mentioned, but they of course were the &quot;witches.&quot;)<br />Of course,  the female magic of the common folk was not approved of by the newly  educated upper class male population who are famous for starting the  Reformation and the Renaissance, so they initiated a long period of large  scale persecution began.

As a Catholic growing up in the predominantly WASP world of 1950s American  South, I was taught that the era in which my church played a major role in  European History was called the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; -- and that it was  marked with ignorance, filth, idolatry, and barbarity that was only  overcome with the rise of rational thought, commercialism, and  neoclassicism.  A few years ago, I set out to learn the truth--to study the  period now known as the Middle Ages.<br />Medievalist scholars pretty much  agree the Middle Ages include the thousand or so years following the fall  of Rome (c.500 A.D.) to the revival of rationalism, Roman law,  bureaucracies, and neoclassical art known as the Italian Renaissance. In  his book, Norman Cantor distills the work of many leading scholars in  Europe and America writing during the latter part of the 19th Century and  through the 20th. He organizes their work into various schools of thought  including legalists, propagandists, revolutionaries, fantasists,  formalists, outriders and others.<br />He says the task these scholars  undertook was to conceptually and operationally define or  &quot;invent&quot; the Middle Ages by addressing several questions: What  sources lead to the rise and dominance of Western society; How did a legal  system that still exists today emerge (i.e. in the Commonwealth of Virginia  and other U.S. states as well as England); How did kings govern without  bureaucracies; How did the labor and aspirations of peasants and the  ambitions and bellicosity of aristocrats lead to the respect for the  authenticity of comman man; How did the various structures of the Roman  Empire precondition Medieval philosophy; How did the shift from God the  Father to God the Loving Son lead to humanism; How did the church function  with hierarchical authority on one side and evangelical groups and  individual piety on the other?<br />The scholarly study of the Middle Ages  acquired it's impetus from the Romantic Movement of the 19th Century, which  manifested itself as Gothic Revival architecture, Art Deco, PreRaphalite  painting, the writing of authors from Bronte to C.S. Lewis and  J.R.R.Tolkien, the enfranchisement of the comman man, and the emancipation  of slaves and women. The Romantics reacted to the atrocities of  industrialization, the exploitation of labor, the corruption of the  environment and the spread of disease, malnourishment and poverty by a  utilitarian and unthinking society.<br />Cantor provides a good overview of  the thinking of the past 120 years or so. He covers many well known  historians, such as Maitland, Kantorowitz, Panofsky, C.S. Lewis, and his  own mentor the Professor R. W. Southern.  He includes the followers of Karl  Marx and Emile Durkheim in the section the &quot;French Jews&quot; which  includes essays on Braudel and Bloch. Cantor says the book &quot;Feudal  Society&quot; by Mark Bloch is one of the best ever written about the  Middle Ages. He has many negative comments about &quot;The Waning of the  Middle Ages&quot; by the Dutch writer Huizinga, but Cantor undoubtedly read  the older less accurate translation. A new translation of Huizinga's work  is titled &quot;Autumn in the Middle Ages&quot; and it's thesis is somewhat  different from that found in the older translation.<br />Cantor's book  provides a good overview of the subject of the Middle Ages, and  I  recommend it for anyone starting out on this subject.

Once upon a time, France did not exist. Julius Caesar said the land of the  Gauls (tribes the Greeks called Keltoi) was divided into three parts and he  set out to conquer them all. Caesar was probably speaking of the area known  today as France, as well as parts of Switzerland, Germany, and the Low  countries.  Caesar subdued many tribes in living in the land of the Gauls,  but only the southern part was ever completely romanized -- Gallia  Narbonensis. When the Roman Empire collapsed, Northern Gaul was once again  dominated by warriors known as Franks.<br />George Duby begins his story  in the year 987 A.D. and ends it in 1460 with the success of the Capetians  who in defeating Henry VI, finally drove the English from their land.  During this 500 year period, France developed from a land composed of small  settlements and huge swaths of rural farmland and wilderness to a network  of villages and towns centered on commerce and trade. In 987 A.D. Duby says  power was tied to geneology, but by the end, wealth was also a major  factor.<br />Duby not only addresses the Middle Ages of 987 to 1460 A.D., but  he comments on how he as an historian went about reconstructing his story  from contemporary materials available from various sources. So, this is not  only a history book, it is a book on historiography of sorts. For example,  Duby says the use of various Latin words in various documents could mean  many different things. How does the historian know what these terms imply?  The underlying meaning of Latin words changed over time, just as English  words we use today have changed meaning over time.<br />My favorite section of  the book is &quot;The Village.&quot;  Around 1,000, villages as they came  to be known, did not exist in France. There were 'bourgs' which were small  towns outside the gates of walled monasteries, or where a castle or a Roman  Villa had once existed.  Castles were built everywhere during the Feudal  period as lords battled for control of their lands.  These castles were  known in France as 'maisons fortes' or fortified houses.  Lords and their  retinues moved from one fortified house to another and never slept in the  open. In the southwest, these fortified castles were known as 'castelnaus.'<br />Because of the power of the church, the territory now know as France  seems to have been organized into parishes (parochia). The parish center  was a church (later a cathedral) and it's  burial grounds. Christian  churches were probably built where pagan structures had once stood.  (Panofsky suggests the major Cathedrals in France are laid out in the  pattern of the constellation Libra). Women came to the burial grounds and  left grave goods, a pagan practice Duby says the church eventually  eradicated (guess he didn't read &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and  Evil&quot;).<br />Duby indicates there was little &quot;law and order&quot; of  the sort dominant males appreciate in 1,000 A.D. He says many groups vied  for power including a multitude of splinter groups who &quot;occupied the  twilight between heresy and orthodoxy.&quot;  Women, were perceived to  wield magical pwoers and were greatly feared. In the rural areas dominated  by women, male power was impotent.<br />Duby's book covers the transition  from a world where families fought for power and the rural areas ruled, to  one where one lord finally dominated the others--the King. The winning  family was named Capet and one or another branch of this family dominated  France until the French Revolution.  The source of their power was commerce  and trade, and their close alliance with the church.heir lands.  These castles were  known in France as 'maisons fortes' or fortified houses.

For a number of years, historians of various backgrounds have attempted to  conceptually and operationally define the &quot;Middle Ages.&quot; In  'Time, Work, and Culture in the Middle Ages' Jacques Le Goff, a top French  Historian outlines his perspective via a collection of essays he developed  on this subject over several years.<br />Le Goff suggests the modern  historian should use the techniques of the ethnographer, the findings of  archeologists, and the records of courts, commerce, and confessor's manuals  to construct the everyday world of the inhabitants of Europe during the  Middle Ages. He says he is not going to try to turn the Dark Ages into the  Golden Ages, and he is not operating without a theory since that is  virtually impossible--in spite of the claims to the contrary by some modern  theorists. As he mentions the 'division of labor' in several contexts, I  imagine he is following social theories outlined by 20th Century French  historians such as Durkheim, Mauss, and Bloch.<br />Le Goff sets about  untangling a story he says began with the fall of the Roman Empire and  ended with the Industrial Age ('Longue duree' of Fernand Braudel).  He  seems to view the Renaissance and Reformation as the natural culmination of  forces that arose during the Middle Ages: the division of labor and the  division of time.<br />Le Goff says much evidence suggests a tripartite  society arose in the 900s and gained ascendency by the 1200s. This society  was composed of: oratores (clergy), bellatores (warriors), and laboratores  (workers). Fortunately or unfortunately, the division of society did not  end with three groups. He says the Middle Ages involved two major  processes: the division of labor and the division of time, and that these  two processes were inseparable.<br />Le Goff spends much time discussing  the laboratores and how their work day, which was once measured as sun-up  to sun-down (God's time as depicted in the &quot;Book of Months&quot;) came  to be measured and paid in hourly rates as the result of the growing power  of commercial interests. The land-based wealth of the feudal lords and  their peasant farmer tenants was subverted by commercial practices that  ultimately exploited and alienated the artisan workers. These alienated  workers later grew in power and became involved in peasant revolutions and  other disruptive activities.<br />The sections of Le Goff's essays that most  fascinated me described the rise of church power at the expense of the  &quot;old&quot; religion of the common people.  During the Middle Ages, the  Church acquired enormous power. The clergy (oratores) were mostly monastics  and penitents to begin with, but with the rise of commerce and trade, many  of them became mendicants and secular scholars. These scholars lay the  groundwork for the reformation and renaissance.<br />But before the church  splintered into the hundreds of protestant groups that came into existence  following the reformation, it managed to subdue many of the common folk  beliefs. Of particular fascination to me was the recorded history of the  demise of the dragon who went from noble beast in the old religion to  maligned serpent killed by saints in the new religion.  Another section  that fascinated me involved the witch.  Citing 'La Sorciere' by Michelet,  Le Goff says he thought the witch was &quot;productive because she gave  birth to modern science....While the clergy and the schoolman were mired in  the world of imitation, bloatedness, sterility, and anti-nature, the witch  was redicovering nature, the body, mind, medicine, and the natural  sciences.&quot;to be measured and paid in hourly rates as the result of the growing power  of commercial interests.

Regine Pernoud is my new favorite historian. Ms. Pernoud  writes about the Middle Ages when men were men and women were--well if not  in charge pretty darn close to being so. Ms. Pernoud's premise contradicts  much of what I have read elsewhere, but she goes to the primary sources and  produces much material to support her thesis.<br />First of all, Pernoud says  a number of women living in the Middle Ages were queens in their own right.  She names these rulers--and some better known than others largely owing to  the writing of male historians who seemed to have concentrated on queens  married to illustrious men.  Of course, there was Eleanor of Aquataine--the  grandmother of Europe--who was the wife of both a French and an English  king (in succession).  She went on a Crusade with her French King. Later,  she married Henry II and became the mother of Richard I and poor John of  the Magna Carta fame. But Eleanor had some pretty well situated daughters  also, and Pernoud tells the reader about them. Also, Eleanor's  mother-in-law was the famous Matilda, who sparred with her usurper cousin  Stephen for the English throne, which she finally secured for her son Henry  II. Another, lesser known queen was a Matilda who along with Agnes of  Poitou played a major role in the reforms of the church in the 11th Century  by siding with the Pope against the Holy Roman Emperor. &quot;Matilda Dei  gratia si quid est&quot; -- Matilda by the grace of God if she is anything.<br />Hildegard von Bingen has become known in our age because of her  beautiful music, and of course many other women were powerful Abbesses in  their own right--or Saints like Joan of Arc. I found interesting Pernoud's  assertion that the Celtic and Germanic tribes welcomed Christianity because  it reinforced their notions of equality of the sexes and the hearth and  home as the center of life.  So, not only were women queens of countries  and lords of fiefdoms, they were &quot;queens&quot; of households. Pernoud  points out what any archeologist will tell you--family wealth is centered  in the hearth and home--combs, copper pots, and gold crosses.<br />And  Charing Cross?  That's named for Eleanor of Castile, granddaughter of  Eleanor of Aquataine.  When she died, her husband had a gold cross mounted  everywhere they had lived. One site can be found at the Charing Cross  station in London. Charing Cross is a corruption of &quot;Chere reine&quot;  -- beloved queen.of households.

Well, although I am American, my mother liked to remind me that four of my  great-grandparents sailed from the Netherlands in the 1870s--two from  Groningen and two from Zealand.  I am happy to see the tulip craze did not  begin in either of those places. I can understand the craze for tulips  however. Yesterday, I bought $200 worth of tulip bulbs--never mind whether  I have the discretionary funds for this mania.<br />&quot;Tulipomania&quot;  is an interesting little book on the order of the recently released tale  about William Bligh's 4,000 mile sea journey after he involuntarily  disembarked the Bounty (&quot;Portable Nightmare&quot; by John Toohey).  &quot;Tulipomania&quot; is just as narrowly focused.  It excerpts the story  of the frenzied tulip buying, selling and subsequent financial crash in the  17th Century Netherlands from a larger context covered extensively in the  &quot;Embarrassment of Riches&quot; by Simom Schama.  Can one really  understand the Dutch and their tulips from this little book? Well, if  you're just getting started reading Dutch history this is a good place to  begin, but for heaven's sake don't make it your last book on the subject.<br />&quot;Tulipomania&quot; really isn't for those gardners or botonists who  want to know more about tulips. Anna Pavord's lavishly illustrated  &quot;Tulip&quot; is much more useful for learning about the almost  infinite varieties of this plant. &quot;Tulipomania&quot; should appeal  more to readers with an interest in political-economics and the dynamics of  group mania buying by the public (bought any &quot;beanie babies&quot;  lately?).<br />I learned a few things from &quot;Tulipomania&quot; or maybe I  had read them elsewhere and remembered them when I read this book. For  example, I did not recall that tulip mania was concentrated among a small  group of relatively poor people, and that it had little impact on the Dutch  economy. Also, I was reminded the government tried to deal with the  problems following the drop in tulip prices.<br />Their are many anecdotal  bits in this book including the story of the orphans of one Wouter Winkle.  These children lost both parents and all they had left in the world were  the tulip bulbs their unfortunate father left them. How the market saved  them is heart-rending.<br />Dash uses much secondary material and he cites  Schma, Pavord, Israel, Norwhich, and other bona fide historians who have  dealt with various aspects of the Dutch, their tulips and how the Ottoman  Turks blew the chance to be the tulip kings of the world. The Ottoman  rulers rivaled the old Roman Emperors for nastiness -- Caligula to name  one. They were too busy being despicable to women and white Christian  slaves to get serious about their tulip bulbs. When a Turk minister finally  took a keen interest in breeding tulip bulbs that could have helped Turkey  corner the market, his ruler had him killed.oblems following the drop in tulip prices.  <br />Their are many anecdotal  bits in this book including the story of the orphans of one Wouter Winkle.

Have you reached the point in your gardening career where you'd like to  move on from lawns and beds of gaudy annuals to the more refined art of  perennial gardening?  This guide book provides an overview of what you  might consider.<br />The Rodale press has been publishing ecologically  responsible  books and magazines for a number of years (at least 30 -- I  first subscribed to &quot;Organic Gardening&quot; in the early 1970s).  Their committment to promoting environmentally friendly ways to garden is  evident in this publication. Sections that will prove most instructive for  &quot;green&quot; gardeners cover: 1) pests, weeds, diseases and  ecologically sound ways to cope with them; and 2) soil composition and how  to improve it with organic materials including compost.<br />The garden  designs found in Section 1 are tricky. In my experience, it is useful to  plan a bit, but as John Lennon said, life is what happens when you're  making other plans. Most of the designs are a bit complicated for  experienced perennial gardeners let alone the new gardeners. Juggling  plants for size, color, height, blooming time, soil composition, water,  light needs, PH and other requirements is no small task.  The authors have  presented plant combinations that will work together, but they will not  work everywhere. If I was starting out, I'd plant  a few perennials and add  more as I became confident the first plants were going to make it. Also,  many gardeners forget that plants grow. I would start with a combo of  perennials, bulbs, and annuals and remove the annuals as the perennials  take over.<br />The authors have provided a good A-Z list of perennials in  Part Three of the book (many can survive the blackest thumb for at least  one season). None of the plants listed is impossible to find--in fact many  can be found in the larger nursery. Whether you can find the colors or type  you want is another matter. The authors suggest using seeds for some plants  and mail order companies for others. A list of resources (plant and bulb  suppliers)can be found in the back of the book.<br />Since not all plants do  well in all areas, you may want to take time to look at other people's  gardens and your local botanical gardens before you do anything.

Griet, the protagonist of Tracy Chevalier's &quot;Girl With a Pearl  Earring&quot; is very much like the girl in Vermeer's painting of the same  name--keeping her own counsel, beautiful, and a bit enigmatic. The reader  eventually comes to know some things about Griet--the color of her hair for  example. We know only a bit more about her thoughts, motivations, and  actions. Why is she so bold at times? Imagine a mere serving girl  rearranging Vermeer's artifacts set out for a painting--especially after  being warned not to do so by the Mistress of the household! And, she never  really confesses directly how she feels about Vermeer. I can only think of  &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; -- does she desire the man or the  artist? And, speaking of enigmas, I still don't know much about Vermeer.<br />  The girl in Vermeer's painting is unlike anything else he ever created.  For one thing, while many of the sitters for his paintings can be  identified, and the yellow satin cape with the ermine trim shows up over  and over, the girl in this painting remains a mystery. According to  &quot;Johannes Vermeer&quot; printed by the National Gallery in Washington,  &quot;The Girl..&quot; has proven difficult to identify because there is no  parallel for her clothing with contemporary Dutch fashions. Also, the  concept of the painting is very different from the other interior genre  scenes Vermeer painted. &quot;The Girl..&quot; exists against a backdrop of  black. And, the skin tones of &quot;The Girl.. are created by  &quot;layering a thin flesh-colored glaze over a transparent  undermodeling&quot; something apparently Vermeer had not done in any of his  other paintings and did not do as well in later paintings.  He seems to  have been truly inspired by this girl. Who was she?<br />Chevalier attempts to  draw her own portrait of the girl. Her story is compelling, evolving not  unlike Vermeer's painting, where overlay after overlay of color is used to  build the subject's image. The plot is not complex.  The book could have  been titled &quot;two years in the life of Vermeer's sitter of the girl  with the pearl earring.&quot;  Speaking of which, the book can be easily  read in two sittings.<br />Two recently released books involving a Dutch  painting: &quot;The Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; by Susan Vreeland and  Michael Frayn's book &quot;Headlong&quot; have been compared with &quot;The  Girl With a Pearl Earring.&quot;  For me, &quot;The Girl..&quot; by  Chevalier is better than &quot;Blue..&quot; by Vreeland, but Michael  Frayn's book is the best.

In &quot;..1568, the Holy Office [in Rome] condemmed the entire population  of the Netherlands to death as heretics, and the king ordered the sentence  to be carried out at once, without regard to age, sex or  condition.&quot;<br />Readers of &quot;The Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; or  &quot;The Girl With the Pearl Earring&quot; will find &quot;Headlong&quot;  a bit more challenging, however, what it lacks in simplicity and slimness  it makes up for in verismilitude. And, unlike one other reviewer, I don't  think you have to understand all the esoterica of Dutch painting to  &quot;get&quot; the story. Also, if you read and appreciated Simon Schama's  &quot;Embarrassment of Riches&quot; and Umberto Eco's &quot;Name of the  Rose&quot; this book will be a welcome addition to your library.<br />There  are two main stories in &quot;Headlong&quot; --the one in the foreground  concerns Martin the &quot;art dealer&quot; philosper who is trying to pull  a fast one on his neighbor Tony Churt by acquiring for a nominal sum a  potentially valuable painting in the latter's possession. The second story,  which I found even more intriguing, concerns the origin of the painting in  question which may have been executed by Pieter Bruegel sometime in the  bloody 16th Century in the Netherlands.<br />When Martin first describes  &quot;The Merrymakers&quot; many readers will suspect it is a Bruegel or  &quot;after&quot; Bruegel. Martin's search for information to determine  whether or not the painting is a Bruegel leads him deeper and deeper into a  bloody past that is not discussed these days. Contempory history classes  teach about slavery and the destruction of American Indians (which took  place at the same time), as well as the plight of Jews in WWII, but we  don't hear much about the &quot;real&quot; bloody history of Europe--until  films like &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Rob Roy&quot; and &quot;Les  Miserabe&quot; gain our attention.<br />I am American of Dutch descent and  have read much history on the Netherlands and the wars of religious  freedom, so I was hooked from the beginning on &quot;Headlong.&quot; I  particularly liked Frayn's analogy between the Duke of Alva's troops  (Philip II's Reich commisar) and the Nazi storm troopers of the 20th  Century. One of my earliest memories as a child is my mother cursing the  Nazis because of the havoc they wrecked on her homeland. Make no mistake  about it, &quot;Headlong&quot; is a very serious book about very serious  subjects--religious freedom, oppression and exploitation, and censorship.<br />The destruction of the people of the Netherlands..&quot;seems to have  been beyond even Alva, and that same year the Prince of Orange was provoked  into armed revolt.

For a number of years, I attended gardening workshops sponsored by the  National Wildlife Federation and Brooklyn Botanical Garden held at the NWF  Headquarters in Vienna Virginia. These workshops were always thematic,  covering topics such as 'growing perennials' or 'regional gardening'.  On  more than one occasion I heard Joe Eck or Wayne Winterrowd speak about  their home and garden at North Hill Vermont. Their talks reflected the  various stages of change they experienced as they renovated their old house  and developed their grounds. I particularly remember the oohs and ahs when  they showed us slides of their perennial beds.<br />&quot;Living  Seasonally&quot; continues the story first described in their book &quot;A  Year at North Hill: Four Seasons in a Vermont Garden.&quot;  In this book  they leave the perennials for the vegetable patch.  Eck and Winterrowd are  now working in patch number five.<br />&quot;Living Seasonally&quot; is a  cross between a coffee table book and a garden guide, though for practical  purposes the book is more the former than the latter. Much can be gleaned  from the book as it is filled with all sorts of useful tidbits and  wonderful photographs, but it is not a &quot;how-to garden&quot; book per  se. Also, it covers life in a Vermont garden which is not like life in any  other part of the U.S.  The authors point this out over and over, but some  will forget. For one thing, the growing season is short in Vermont (about  two months before global warming) and much of the garden work is done in  frozen ground or under grow lights in the green house. For another, some  plants that thrive in the cool Vermont summers, don't thrive elsewhere in  the U.S.  and vice versa.  Growing vegetables is tricky. Planting dates  must be attended to with rigor and special consideration must be given the  &quot;ground&quot; work.  The reason Eck and Winterrowd are working in  vegetable patch number five is because the other four patches did not work  out. They are quite forthcoming in the reasons why the other patches were  best abandoned for other types of vegetation.<br />This is an intersting book  with lots of anecdotal material that may or may not prove relevant to  gardeners outside Vermont. I  read from mere curiostity more than anything.  Much of what they describe for their garden in Zone 4 or 5 will not work in  my Virginia patch in Zone 7. I do like their photographs of garden designs  and fixtures as well as farm animals. However, I think the animals are  mostly ornate creatures kept for show. This is a very picturesque book.out.

Well, okay, maybe you would place in on the coffee table if your book  shelves aren't high enough, but this is a practical book. &quot;American  Art Tile&quot; covers the period from 1876-1941.  Why does it stop in 1941?  Because sadly, many tile making firms shut down for WWII and never  reopened.<br />The book shows photographs of hundreds of tiles made by more  than 100 American firms (probably every one Mr. Karlson could identify).  Included are the Dedham Pottery in Dedham Massachusetts with it's famous  blue and white scenes of rabbits running around the edge of the tile; the  Moravian Pottery and Tile Works in Doylestown, Pennsylvania with it's  fantastic Eastern European images; The Weller Pottery in Zanesville Ohio  with it's &quot;Sicardo&quot; works; Rookwood Pottery in Cincinnati, Ohio  which produced the matte glazed architectural tile used in the New York  Subway system such as Fulton's Steamboat at the Fulton Street Station; and  the wonderful Pewabic Pottery in Detroit Michigan from the Chippawa word  for copper colored clay.<br />These tiles are not all individually labled, so  if you're trying to identify a particular item, the book will provide only  limited information. On the other hand, it will probably help you determine  the origin of the manufacturing company, if not the name of the specific  design. According to Karlson, many of the companies are out of business, so  this may be as good as it gets since catalogues are impossible to obtain.<br />Mr. Karlson includes many photographs of individual tiles, but few are  show 'in situ' so the pages can become overwhelming in their detail.  However, the book is probably destined to be something antique tile dealers  keep in their reference desk. If you're a serious tile collector or  fancier, you will probably find the book worth the cost.	2000-09-01

These days, many of us are becoming reacquainted with the art of our  parents or grandparents...not the clunky Victorian stuff, but the wonderful  jazzy &quot;art&quot; of the &quot;nouveau.&quot; Sometimes I wonder why we  ever got away from it, but I suspect two world wars and an economic  depression in the 20th century played a big role.<br />In this lovely  historical overview of the Art Nouveau period of tilemaking, Hans van  Lemmen provides many up-close examples of individual decorative tiles, as  well as 'in situ' photographs of the architectural designs employing these  tiles. He begins by describing the Art Nouveau movment itself, which he  says can be traced to various sources including the negative reaction to  neoclassicism by various 19th Century artists and intellectuals. Some of  them felt neoclassical art was pagan and wanted to return to a Gothic or  Christian theme. Others reacted to the commercial and industrial use of the  neoclassical and wanted to return to a naturalistic theme. In addition,  Western artists during this period were heavily influenced by Japanese,  Chinese and Indonesian art, which they incorporated into their work. It  should surprise no one that one example Van Lemmen provides is a tile  executed about 1900 which shows yellow and orange sunflowers (ala Van Gogh  who died in 1890).<br />The book covers the major Art Nouveau centers.  The  section on Northern Europe (heavy emphasis on France where the movement may  have begun) shows salon panels in private homes and other interior  applications; Central Europe (especially Bohemia and Hungary) shows many  exterior applications; Southern Europe, which features some of the Art  Nouveau maiolica found in Barcelona; and the &quot;New World&quot; which  includes the Bayard Building on Bleeker Street in New York City designed by  Louis Sullivan (Chicago School of Architecture). Many of Van Lemmen's  photographs include &quot;fantastical&quot; designs depicting nature,  mythology, and abstract decorative subjects. Overall, this book is an  informative introduction to the topic of Art Nouveau tiles and their uses  and the section on Eastern Europe is worth the price of the book.abstract decorative subjects.

One of the more famous 'landscape' Dutch tiles shows a man in a small boat  sailing away from the viewer, up the Issel or some other river in the  Netherlands. The rounded end of his boat lifts out of the water as the wind  billows the sails and tilts the craft. The river surface is slighly  rippling in the gentle breeze. In the distance lays a town, perhaps  Deventer.  When I look at this tile I feel transported to a place and time  long ago.<br />The Dutch produced the greatest painters in the world, and  many of their works hang in museums, or in private collections out of the  reach of mere mortals. Sometimes something is so beautiful you want to own  it, or at least possess it a short while.  What to do?  Buy a tile.  Dutch  tiles were frequently copied from paintings and like paintings they depict  landscapes, interior domestic scenes, flowers (especially tulips), ships at  sea and all sorts of wonderous things.<br />Hans van Lemmen has compiled a  nice overview of the history of Dutch tilemaking.  He says it was natural  for a people who had been occupied by the Spanish for a long time to have  become aware of the 'Hispano-Moresque' tradition of tile making. But many  other factors conspired to make tile making the &quot;signature form of  decorative art&quot; of the Dutch. For one thing, the little country has  many river banks and lots of clay. For another, during the 16th Century,  many Flemish tile artisans moved to the Netherlands to set up shop and  enjoy the expanding Dutch economy. Another major factor was the incredible  growth of a middle class that wanted to tiles for home use.<br />These uses  included lining fire places, mantles, and the wall areas around them, as  well as the areas where candles sat, in order to prevent house fires. The  Dutch also lined their cellers to prevent water seeping into them.  Areas  exposed to much wear and tear, such as passageways, staircases, and doors  were also covered with tiles. And, in a country where hygiene is a defining  national characteristic tiles were important accessories in kitchens  because they were easy to clean.<br />van Lemmen covers about 400 years of  tilemaking, with most of his emphasis on the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the  16th-17th centuries.  The book contains a nice balance of history and  photographs of tiles and 'in situ' settings of Dutch tiles in the  Netherlands and other parts of the world.

Surely other fans of Margaret Atwood  find her  books as wonderful and unpredictable as I do. Reading Atwood has made me  laugh so hard I cried (Lady Oracle, Life Before Man); made me angry (The  Handmaid's Tale); made me reflective and pensive (Cat's Eye); and made me  wonder out loud (Alias Grace). If they give out awards for versitility in  writing, Atwood should win hands down.<br />To me, &quot;Alias Grace&quot;  reads like one of the more recent histories of Simon Schma which covered  high crimes and misdemeanors in the 19th century. What really did happen to  Grace Marks? Atwood presents the facts, you be the judge. The evidence  concerning Grace Marks is conflicted. Was she a notorious killer or  innocent victim? If Atwood is trying to shape the conclusion in the  reader's mind, she is certainly subtle. I got the audiobook for my aunt,  and she's still ticked off because Atwood didn't really spell out the  verdict in a simple yes or no.<br />This is a tale of intrigue, mystery,  history, and the supernatural--or is it.  Grace hears voices or does she?  Do they come from the spirit world or Grace's imagination? Does Grace  control her soul or is she possessed or mad? I found the book absolutely  spellbinding.	2000-08-24

It is said when the student is ready the teacher will appear, and for me this has always been the case. Having first studied Latin and Spanish, I  finally arrived at a point in my life where I wanted to learn French.  Suddenly, everything seemed to facilitate my efforts. My job enabled me to  travel to France, I discovered my new colleague was a French tutor in his  spare time, and one day I found this little book.<br />Imagine a story about  learning a language that holds your interest as the momentum builds until  suddenly you reach the climax -- the sounding of the perfect French  &quot;R&quot;. Those who've worked and worked at learning a language can  appreciate the moment.  But this book is not just about reaching the  perfect French &quot;R&quot; it's about coming of age.<br />The writer is a  professor of French Literature at Duke University who says she found her  own voice through the learning of another language--French.  But before she  did that, she was a young girl living in America who was the daughter of a  man who took part in the Trials at Nuremberg.

Edith Wharton wrote &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (I believe it won the  Pulitzer), the only fiction she wrote that I have truly liked--and an  excellent book.  She also wrote much nonfiction, and I have enjoyed her  travel writing very much.<br />In this book, Ms. Wharton reflects on her  childhood and adulthood to middle age. (A short biography of her life is  included in the introduction by Louis Auchincloss.) She speaks of her  parents and growing up in 'Old New York' and living on the Gold Coast of  New England with her husband.<br />Ms. Wharton was a great friend of several  men of letters who were prominent during her era, including Henry James.  Her writing describes these relationships in part.  She may have had an  affair with one of them (not James), but unlike writers of today, more is  not said than said. Mrs. Wharton divorced her husband in an era when it was  not the best thing to do if one wished to remain a member of high society.  She seems to have cast off New York society and moved to France to live  permantly after her divorce. If you're interested in the story behind the  story in &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; this book is a good resource.<br />In addition to her early years in America and later years in France,  this book covers some of Ms. Wharton's travels in France and the  Mediterranean.  The most evocative sections cover her experiences in a trip  to the French front in WWI.  During WWI, she became a reporter and sent  information to a New York newspaper on a regular basis.	2000-08-24

Have you ever felt a need to reach a certain physical destination or bring  some effort to fruition before you die? Why is the human reverence for  places such as Notre Dame, Jerusalem, or Mecca so strong? In times past,  people made pilgrimages to holy shrines and sacred spots to atone for sins,  seek a cure, keep promises, or recover holy ground from barbarians. Today,  many people travel to escape reality, or to break a routine.<br />In  &quot;The Art of Pilgrimage&quot; Phil Cousineau says travel can take on a  larger role.  He proposes a &quot;seeker's guide to making travel  sacred.&quot; The book explores the steps of the sacred pilgrimage:  &quot;The Longing&quot;, &quot;The Call&quot;, &quot;Departure&quot;,  &quot;The Pilgrim's Way&quot;, The Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;The  Arrival.&quot;<br />Cousineau has set down in print an idea that has been  floating around my head for some time. I don't seek out the traditional  holy places, but I have wandered from one artist's home to another--Nohant  or Bath or Rye or Waldon or Bloomsbury or Salisbury.  In doing so, I have  felt connected to the spirit of the artist who once lived and worked in  that space. Perhaps they are my lost saints.	2000-08-24

Well this book has been a best seller, and it's a good read, but you may  not find it as scary as the cover hype indicates -- probably because it's  relatively formulaic. (The newspapers are filled with far worse stories  which are too real and to which the author alludes -- the Toronto murders,  Jeffery Dahmer in Wisconsin, Ted Bundy for example).<br />I read mysteries  sporadically, but avoid the more frightening ones (I scare easily). I got  hold of this one accidentally but read it anyway. The first third was  pretty awful (scary) and the killer is a disgusting pig. It's possible the  book was so scary I just went into the ZONE--a place one of the frightened  young victims of this killer uses as an escape mechanism.<br />The main  characters Kate, a victim's advocate, and John Quincy an FBI profiler are  well developed, likeable and believeable -- well almost.  She's supposed to  resemble Rene Russo and he's supposed to look like George Clooney. The book  is a psychological thriller and there's lots of familiar cop work and  banter as the police hunt the killer the press calls &quot;The  Cremator&quot; and the cops call &quot;Smokey Joe.&quot;  I recognized  elements of other mystery stories --fires to disquise corpses, serial  killers, tape recorded torture (of women of course), victims trapped at  home, and a helpless heroine in need of rescue. As I say, the book is  entertaining if you want to &quot;zone out&quot;, but now I gotta go read  something to repair my intelligence quota.	2000-08-23

Edith Wharton has written two books worthy of being read by everyone,  &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; and &quot;A Motor-Fight Through  France.&quot; Ms. Wharton was a wealthy New Yorker and in a day when most  could not afford to do so (before WWI) she set out by automobile with her  husband and her friend Henry James to tour the French countryside. This  might not seem a &quot;big deal&quot; today, but visualize a country where  one could only travel by train and out of the way places were inaccessible  except by wagon or oxcart.<br />The book contains descriptions of several  trips. One trip takes the reader in a big swoop from northern France to  southern France and back. She visits the home of Madam Dudevant (George  Sand) and a number of churches and other buildings of historic interest.  There are only a few old photographs in the book, so one might need to  consult another source to fully enjoy her descriptions of various places.  I've taken a few courses on French arcitecture and visted France several  times and I still had to consult other books--but it's worth it.  Some of  the French countryside has been altered and some of the older places are  gone. The most memorable visits are to Nohant, home of George Sand.  It is  obvious Ms. Wharton considered Sand a spiritual mentor.<br />In her other  books and articles, Ms. Wharton covered Spain, Italy and points of interest  in the Mediterranean. She later visited the front during WWI and became a  war correspondent for an American newspaper. This book covers the halcyon  days before the carnage when the world was younger and more innocent.	2000-08-19

Too bad this book has to be special ordered but I guess it's not a best seller.  Thank goodness Amazon provides a service that allows you to find  out something about a book not readily available.

Sure they do, and what they exhale we breathe.<br />But this  book is also for beginners and the merely curious. You can find out about  &quot;kitchen gardens&quot;, &quot;NPK&quot; and &quot;root-rot.&quot;  In  other words, when your garden book is written in such a way that the author  of the book assumes you have knowledge you don't have, you can use this  book to look up the terms you don't understand.  Think you won't need it?  Do you know what &quot;NPK&quot; stands for?  If not, you need this book.  NPK is the symbol for nitrogen for leaves-phosphorus for roots-potassium  for flowers and fruits.

Fisher wrote a number of books covering various aspects of food,  cooking, travel, and her own autobiography. She moved to France before WWII  with her then husband Fisher.  Her birth name was Mary Frances Kennedy and  she was raised in Whittier California.  She kept Fisher as a last name  throughout her life although she divorced him for a man who became the love  of her life and her second husband.  He suffered from an ailment (result of  a wound he sustained in WWI I believe)the pain of which eventually caused  him to end his own life. She remarried a third time, had two little girls  and divorced her third husband. Following the divorce, she took the two  girls and went to live in southern France -- a place she knew and loved  deeply. &quot;Two Towns...&quot; picks up her autobiography at this  point.<br />The &quot;two towns&quot; were orginally published as &quot;Map of  Another Town&quot; and &quot;A Considerable Town&quot;.  The first book is  about Aix-en-Provence founded more than two thousand years ago by Roman  invaders. Gaius Marius and Julius Caesar both spent time in Aix and Roman  remains can be found everywhere. Many artists have found Aix irresistable.<br />Fisher lived in Aix for a time and her writing concerns everyday events  -- the view from the apartment, the habits of the landlady, shopping, food  preparation, eating meals cooked by others, school days for the girls. What  makes the book extraordinary is Fisher's descriptive writing about the  exotic setting composed of beautiful architecture, gardens, fountains,  passageways and gates and excentric people. I prefer Fisher's writing to  that of more recently relocated authors who have moved to Provence and  record their struggles to overcome their surroundings. Fisher moved to  Provence and accepted it.<br />&quot;A Considerable Town&quot; is about  Marseille in the 1950's.  Considered a dangerous place for centuries,  Marseille has  always a source of interest. MFK Fisher is not as fond of  Marseille as she was of other places in France, but she went there anyway,  and writes objectively.  She says Marseille has a reputation of being a  &quot;world capital for dope, whores, and street violence.&quot;  She  considers this information a bit erroneous and goes on to write a more  balanced account. She says others have used words such as &quot;apart,  unique, unusual&quot; but these words are not enough.  She says she keeps  returning for &quot;a week, ten days, many weeks or a month&quot; and  searches for the reasons why the city attacts her.  She says the city is  very old, has an infantile enjoyment of playing.<br />I found this book so  enjoyable, I am ordering the hard cover.

Sandra Ladendorf has written a guide for &quot;Southern Gardeners&quot;  which she defines as gardens in a land area stretching from southern Long  Island New York to the far Southwest -- Zone 7 and Zone 8 on the USDA  map.<br />This is a helpful book for garden beginners. Ladendorf covers the  many flowers, perennial and annual, one might try with some success.  One  chapter covers lawn care (which I don't do as it's destructive to the  environment), and another covers shrubs.  She has a separate section on  Azaleas and Rhododendrons.<br />The paperback version is printed on  semi-gloss paper so it can withstand some moisture if you haul it outside  on the deck. I am not investing in the hardcover version as I will give  this book away to a new gardener. There are many nice illustrations and  decent color photographs that will help one identify the more common  plants.  Ladendorf includes more text than photographs, often a good sign  in a &quot;how-to&quot; book.	2000-08-19

This book is about 158 pages long and reads like a serial in a  newspaper--reminds me of Charles Kurult's bus trips across the U.S. except  the camera crew travels across the U.K. Bainbridge records the daily trip  in a writer's jounal.<br />The sections are laid out in journal form covering  events day by day and many of the cities warrent a separate chapter. Like a  motion picture camera, Bainbridge vividly records the detail of what is to  be seen -- the view from the bus, the accomodations, the food, the  highlights and frustrations. Her trip begins in Southhampton, then goes to  these places: Salisbury, Bristol; Cotswolds; Birmingham; Stoke-on-Trent;  Mancester, Liverpool, Bradford; Newcastle-upon-Tyne; Stockton-on-Tees;  York, Lincoln, and Norwhch; and ends in Milton Keynes.<br />Baninbridge's trip  is a &quot;sort-of&quot; southwest-northeast drive and one you might  consider replicating in part if you're thinking of taking a motor trip  though England. You'll miss many historic places (London), but you'll get a  feel for the diversity of the land and it's people.	2000-08-19

A few years ago I discovered Dalziel (pronounced &quot;deal&quot;) and Pascoe on A&amp;E. I became intrigued, and set out to read all Hill's many  books on this infamous pair of &quot;thinking&quot; British cops. I am now  almost caught up as &quot;On Beulah Height&quot; is the next to the last  installment in Hill's series.<br />I think the best way to read Hill's books  is chronologically, but there are many of them. You can figure out the  order by their publication dates.  The stories are complex so even if you  see them dramatized on A&amp;E you can still enjoy the written text as much  of it is interior monologue/thinking. Hill writes books that eschew the  pounding action of many current mystery writers (who give me a headache).  His plots move vigorously, but they are thinking reader's books--somewhat  like those of Colin Dexter.<br />DCI Peter Pascoe and his wife Ellie have to  be one of the nicest, most down-to-earth, and likeable couples around. Hill  has tracked their courtship, marriage, marital problems, and the birth of  their child Rosie, though the various cases Dalziel and Pascoe have  undertaken.  This book continues their story, while simultaneously filling  out the lives of other characters: Dalziel (the fat man from Yorkshire),  Weild(y) (the &quot;gay&quot; cop who rides a motorcycle and has a kindly  heart) and the female cop DC Novello.<br />&quot;On Beulah Height&quot; is a  tough book, as it involves the disappearance and supposed deaths of several  small girls. Interwoven through the search for the abductor/killer is the  tale of Rosie Pascoe's fight for her own life. Hill has used a the device  of a children's story entitled &quot;Nina and the Nix&quot; to structure  his plot.<br />The characters are believable, from the singer Elizabeth  Wulfson to the &quot;retarded&quot; Benny Lightfoot. I like Hill's  inclination to describe the interaction between men and women, husbands and  wives, fathers and daughters, and lovers of both sexes.  Hill understands  human behavior, and his characters are quite believable.<br />In the end, the  loose ends are tied up. You may find one angle a bit stretched, but I am  willing to give Hill the suspension of disbelief.es.

Is there anything herbs can't do?  This heavy paperback book (notebook sized, semi-gloss pages and about an inch thick) covers every angle of herb  growing and use.  The opening pages discuss how to lay out your herb garden  (parterre or pots), what themes you might explore: children's garden  (easy), moonlight garden (reflective), culinary garden (parsley, sage,  rosemary and thyme), Chinese garden (peonies of course), literary gardens  (here's pansies that's for thoughts), gardens for bees (you need a big  yard), gardens for witches (spell-casting and prophylactic herbs), gardens  for meditation and contemplation.<br />Herb growing involves learning  something about the nature of the various plants. For me, this is where the  rubber meets the road. My entire yard consists of herbs and their near  relations.  In my growing zone, some of the combinations shown in this book  will not work. They may work somewhere (in England), but it's misleading to  think the combinations will work everywhere.  Also, some of these herbs are  thugs -- yarrow, catmint, bugleweed, for example -- which means they will  dominate their neighbors.<br />Consider this--Lavendula and other pale fuzzy  plants generally need lots of lime and hot dry sun, while creeping woodruff  needs moist acid soil in shade.  Too much sun and the Woodruff dies.  Too  much moisture and the Lavendula decays. This book shows a garden with these  two plants growing in close proximity.  Granted, the Woodruff is under a  bench, and the Lavender is in the center of the bed, but until you  experiment, you won't know if you can pull this off.  A wrong mix of  moisture and sunlight and one or the other will suffer.  Also, Woodruff  blooms in the Spring in Zone 7 and Lavender blooms in June.  The book shows  several kinds of Lavendula so you will have to experiment to get the right  combo.<br />Not all herbs grow well everywhere.  I love Bee Balm (Bergamot)  but it doesn't do well in my growing zone.  Bergamot does better up north  where the summers are a little bit milder (where delphiniums and phlox do  well.) In my garden, Bergamot comes down with a terminal case of mildew. I  tried growing Bergamot next to Enchinacea and it did not work. The  Echinacea did well--it likes heat and drought.<br />The book dedicates a page  to a goodly number of herbs, and these plants are displayed well -- laid  out in a nice color photo with a box showing cultivation information. I  don't see much about U.S. growing zones on these pages, so you'll probably  be consulting other sources to figure out what will do well in your area.  If I forgot to mention it, the book seems to be one of those British  gardening books that aren't always sensitive to the variety of needs in  U.S. gardens. It does contain a list of U.S. garden suppliers in the back,  however.<br />The book contains hundreds of ideas for herb uses -- recipes  for herb dishes; limited information on herb floral arrangements including  wreaths; information about herb medicinal and homemaking uses (I want a  woad-colored blouse). There's something for almost every part of your body:  face, teeth, feet, nerves, you name it. There's a section on 'Spices' too,  which are not herbs of course, but are used in many of the preparations  such as potpourri.  And, you cannot grow spices in your yard in all  liklihood since they mostly come from the tropics.<br />I invested in the  book even though I know I can't use it without other resource materials.  One of the features I like best is the herb trivia. We learn from the Bible  that Hyssop is a healer.  Seems the penicillan mold grows on it's leaves  and a bath seasoned with Hyssop leaves can relieve bacteria driven diseases  such as leprosy.etter up north  where the summers are a little bit milder (where delphiniums and phlox do  well.)

I just returned from Sheboygan WI home of Kroeler--the bathroom fixtures firm. While there, I visited the Kroeler Art Museum which houses several  &quot;interesting&quot; public restrooms. One of the more amusing pastimes  in this little town is inspecting restrooms filled with Kroler plumbing  fixtures -- and modern tiles. The Kroeler Design Center displays a number  of newer items.<br />I was supprised to see no mention of Kroeler's modern  works in this book, but hey, it's tough to cover 1,000 years of anything.  Several major European firms are mentioned over and over, however. The bulk  of the tiles displayed in this book (in situ in most cases) are located in  Europe, which makes sense. Until the Dutch started using tiles as ballast  in their sailing ships, not many tiles made it to the New World.<br />The  book opens with a discussion of the earliest tiles found in Europe, those  created 'For God and Earthly Princes.'  Many of these tiles are found in  Moorish-Christian Spain.  The next chapter, 'Painted Magnificence' looks at  15th Century tiles from Italy, the early Maiolica (book's spelling) from  Italy is beautiful.  Some of it is too ornate for my tastes, but there are  several lovely pieces. Later sections cover my favorites--Dutch, northern  French, English and Scandanavian and Art Deco.<br />Tiles have been used in  buildings because of their fire resistance properties (fire places and  mantles in particular), hygienic qualities (bath houses and kitchens), and  low need for  maintenance (businesses, public buildings, and transportation  sites). Some of the most amazing tiles are found in the Underground  Stations in London.  Other cities (Paris, Toronto, New York) have followed  suit to a certain extent. I have taken the subway all over London just to  see the station decoration. The book shows details from the Shrub Hill  station in Worcester England which is decorated with Maw and Company  majolica tiles (book spelling). The station scene depicting 'Jack climbs  the Beanstalk' was executed in 1875, and thank goodness no one modernized  it.<br />In a section titled the 'March of the Machine' a page from the  Villeroy and Boch tile catalogue is presented along with many examples of  mass produced tiles 'in situ.' 'The Triump of the Designer' takes the  reader forward to the Art Deco period when Minton, W.B. Simpson and Sons,  Wedgwood and other china manufacturers created art tiles for bathrooms,  kitchens, and public buildings. Shown are Harrods Meat Hall in London,  tin-glazed tiles in a private home in Amsterdam, and the kitchen of the  palatial summer home of the Czar.<br />'The New World' examines tile displays  in America, from New York City to California. Shown are a riverboat scene  in a ceramic plaque at the Fulton street subway station on Lexington Avenue  in New York, the 1913 Dixie Terminal in Cincinnati, and a picture of a  Pennsylvania Dutch farmer created by the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works in  Pennsylvania.<br />The book is beautiful. It contains detailed and larger  photos of whole walls in situ.

Over the past 30 years I've been experimenting with different dishes and just when I think I've discovered something new I find out that someone has  been doing it for ages..and ages.  &quot;The Medieval Kitchen&quot; Recipes  from France and Italy&quot; contains wonderful, doable dishes to suit every  diet. I don't eat red meat, so I won't be having the 'Stuffed Suckling Pig'  or 'Roast Shoulder of Lamb', but with some minor adjustments, I can make  the 'Split-pea or Dried Fava Bean Soup', the 'Herb Soup', or 'Winter Squash  or Pumpkin Soup.' And, the book contains many lovely desserts and  breads.<br />This book was developed by two French historians, Odile Redon and  Fancoise Sabban, and Silvano Serventi, an Italian historian.  Gorges Duby,  a well known French historian who specializes in the study of the Middle  Ages wrote the forward, and the book was translated by Edward Schneider.<br />The historical sources for the book are listed in a separate  'Bibliography' and the recipes are matched with their original documents in  'Recipes by Manuscript Source' -- just in case you feel the authors omitted  something and you want to check it out.<br />The authors make suggestions for  substitutions for ingredients that may be hard to find.  Since I live in  the U.S. I could have a problem finding 'Bitter Orange Juice' for my 'Dover  Sole' -- or the Dover Sole for that matter. No problem, I can substitute an  American fish of similar texture and lemon juice.<br />If you enjoy cooking  and want to experiment, or collect cookbooks and enjoy reading them, or are  interested in the history of the Middle Ages, you will want this little  book. And, the next time you read one of Sharon Penman's novels, you'll  have a better grasp of the dinner menu.	2000-08-15

In LEARNING TO CURSE, Stephen Greenblatt presents a collection of his essays on the works of Shakespeare, Spencer and other authors of the 16th century. The book takes it's title from his first essay, an examination of &quot;The Tempest&quot; by Shakespeare.<br />Greenblatt asks if one can understand a work of art without reference to the artist, his audience, and the social context of period within which the artist worked. He also asks if different audiences in different periods have had similar reactions to the work or even if different people in the same audience in the same period have had the the same reaction. Does a work of art have an intrinsic value that transcends the individual experience over time?<br />On the other hand, Greenblatt says that while the historical context within which the work of art was created is important, it is critical the scholar realize history is not fixed. Using ideas gleaned from the &quot;new historicism&quot; as well as ethnographic and sociological notions, Greenblatt provokes the reader to rethink the idea of 'historical context'.<br />He says his critical approach has been concerned with recovering &quot;as far as possible the historical circumstances&quot; of aesthetic production without viewing history &quot;as a stable prefabricated background against which literary texts can be placed.&quot; Instead, he sees the historical context as a &quot;dense network of evolving and often contradictory social forces.&quot;<br />The essays in this little volume investigate and interpret a series of literary works by authors from Shakespeare to Martin Luther and Thomas Moore. Greenblatt has included a interesting  essay on the case of Martin Guerre in 14th Century France in which he explores the ideas of crime and capital punishment in association with the theft of personal identity in the Middle Ages.	2000-08-10

Harold Bloom's new book, &quot;How to Read and Why&quot; consists of an  anthology of written works from Western culture (short stories, poetry,  novels, drama) he considers noteworthy because they instruct the careful  reader. Anyone who's taken a few college level literature courses will  recognize most of the authors and many of the works: &quot;The Kiss&quot;  by Checkov; &quot;A Good Man is Hard to Find&quot; by O'Connor; &quot;Moby  Dick&quot; by Melville; &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; by Milton; &quot;La Belle  Dame Sans Merci&quot; by Keats.  A few of the other works are a tad more  obscure to non-English majors, but can ususally be found in second or third  level college literature courses. One can picture this book being assigned  to a Freshman level &quot;Survey of Western Literature.&quot;<br />I read the  book, and then asked myself, &quot;What is it about?&quot; Surely this is  not just one more collection of well known works destined to become a  college text? Bloom says early in the book the &quot;How to Read&quot;  consists of 1) Clearing the mind of Cant (eschew topics like  multiculturism, sexism, racism); 2) Reading to improve yourself not others;  3) Reading to become a scholar, &quot;a candle which the love and desire of  all men will light&quot;; 4) Reading like an inventor -- engage in  &quot;creative dyslexia&quot;; 5) Reading to recover the ironic.  Bloom  believes the loss of irony is the death of reading.<br />What struck me about  Bloom's collection is that almost without exception, these works include  violence.  Most of the violence stems from angry White males.  Some are  suffering rejection or loss, real or imagined -- (&quot;La Belle..&quot; by  Keats, Milton's &quot;Pardise Lost&quot; (isn't Satan a White Male?),  Hamlet, Faulkner's &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot;, McCarthy's &quot;Blood  Meridian&quot;). Some of the violence is induced by males, &quot;Hedda  Gabler&quot; by Ibsen, Dostoevsky's &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;,  &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; by Coleridge.  Even Ellison's  &quot;Invisible Man&quot; and Austen's &quot;Emma&quot; are affected.  (&quot;Emma&quot; has a violent scene  where angry whites who have been  disenfranchised by the Enclosure Acts attack Emma and Miss Smith, however,  Bloom does not discuss it.)<br />I personally like many of the writers Bloom  includes in his anthology -- Dickensen, Austen, Keats, Whitman, and Wilde,  but wonder why he did not include George Elliot, Virginia Wolfe, Nathanial  Hawthorn, Henry David Thoreau, or Mark Twain in other than passing comment.  I would not have chosen some of the examples of the author's works that he  included, but it's his book and reflects his taste.  And, I disagree with  one or two of his interpretations.  For example, I think Robert Groves was  correct when he linked &quot;La Belle..&quot; by Keats to the White  Goddess.  Bloom discounts Groves interpretation, linking it to his troubles  with his personal love life, but a few pages later Bloom implies the reader  shouldn't get too &quot;Freudian&quot; when reading, which I think is  exactly what had done with Groves and &quot;La Belle...&quot;<br />This book  left me weary, unlike the much longer, recently realeasd collection of  Lionel Trilling's essays &quot;The Moral Obligation to be  Intelligent.&quot;  One wonders if Trilling had lived to the end of the  20th Century if he would have reflected such bitterness and nihilism.

Trollope writes beautifully, and this will not be the last book  of hers I read. However, I would have liked a bit more character  development.<br />The most understandable character is Gina's daughter Sophy,  who seems to be a bit like her grandmother Vi. (Sometimes when parents are  not emotionally available, a child is lucky enough to live near a loving  grandmother.) To obtain full development for the major characters, Trollop  would have had to double the size of her book, and then it might have been  more like &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot; (Not storywise--I use this book as  an example where I as the reader had fuller understanding of the  motivations of the main characters.)<br />The story centers on two old  friends, Gina and Laurence who live in the town where they grew up, though  both have acquired spouses elsewhere.  One day, Gina's spouse Fergus leaves  her, and moves from the village to London.  This action devestates Gina and  Sophy her daughter. Gina goes to stay with her friend Laurence and his wife  Hillary at their small hotel, while Sophy moves in with her grandmother Vi.  After three weeks at the hotel, Hillary suggests that Laurance tell Gina  to leave, so Gina finally moves home.  But Laurance continues to see her as  he always has--as a friend.  One day, their relationship slips over the  line. The rest of the book is about the effect of that action on the lives  of the other characters-Vi, Sophy, Hillary, and the three boys of Hillary  and Laurance. The father Fergus is told by his daughter Sophy that his  action has lead to a ripple effect that he could not have forseen when he  decided to move away.<br />I don't think Gina is a villan(ess).  Trollope is  depicting real people, and real people for the most part are complex.  Most  individuals want to be loved, but sometimes they do not behave in loveable  ways.  Love is unconditional, however, we don't love someone because they  behave as we wish, we just love them.  And, it's difficult to understand  what goes on between two people, even when we are the observer with an  author to give us clues.<br />Over the years, I've observed a number of  relationships evolve between two people who are married to other people. In  some cases, the man or woman or both were looking for excitment outside  marriage.  On the other hand, sometimes decent people stray. This doesn't  mean it's morally okay, just that it happens, even when the individual was  not expecting or intending it to happen. I think this is the case for  Laurance. He says he loves both Hillary and Gina. Of course, the  repercussions of his behaviour are hard to bear, particularly for the  children, though they are awful for Hillary.  It's such a shock to discover  the person you loved, and yes took for granted, may be very human and  vulnerable.<br />I can't say very much about how things turn out in this  book, except, from my perspective it is for the best, although frequently,  that is not how I personally have seen it turn out. And, I am not sure that  the woman who ends up with Laurance in the end is the happiest.e someone because they  behave as we wish, we just love them.

Well, I'm a gardener and a wordsmith, and I think you must be both to  really enjoy this book--and I don't recommend it to folks who like to  garden but hate to worry about details. I can't picture someone who  dislikes Latin, or questions why Linnaeus (they won't even know who he is)  insisted on using Latin to develop his taxonomies, finding this book  useful.<br />I've known quite a few &quot;garden artists&quot; who call  plants by their local colloquial names, and when you carry on a  conversation with them they persist in calling Digitalus  &quot;Foxgloves&quot; when we who know Latin know that Digitalus refers to  digits as in parts of hands over which gloves fit--that foxes would  undoubtedly wear if they wore gloves.<br />I learned to forego showing off my  Latin when I was asking serious questions of fabulous &quot;old-time&quot;  gardeners. Latin terms are useful if you're trying to converse with  horticulturists, gardening friends in other localities, or folks who have  migrated from to your growing zone.  Latin is also useful if you're looking  up a name in a good garden book since all of them use Latin.  &quot;Gardener's Latin&quot; contains a simple listing of Latin terms (135  small pages) and seems to have most of the more common terms.<br />If your a  poet, you'll still want to use &quot;Foxgloves&quot;, &quot;Bouncing  Bet&quot; and &quot;Queen Anne's Lace in your discourse.	2000-08-05

I read this book when it was first published and recommned it to anyone  who wants to become more enlightened about the topic. I have a social  science background, and thus a general understanding of the various world  views of traditional societies who are in my opinion closer to old Mother  Earth than most of us &quot;moderns&quot; who spend far too much time  caught up in our technology.  Margot Adler (granddaughter of the famous  psychologist) went exploring (ethnographic field work) and this book is the  result.<br />She does not promote any of the world views she describes, she  plays the good ethnographer and records what she finds. She participates on  several occasions, and thus becomes the &quot;participant observer&quot;  recorder.  I didn't know much about the revival of &quot;paganism&quot; and  had never heard of Wicca before I read Adler's book.  I learned that in  spite of the professed enlightenment of our modern age, many fear the  practices described.  Why?  Basically, the practice of Wicca seems to be a  female oriented way of life--focusing on nature, life, a spiritual path.  I  for one am continuing to read about Wicca and explore what others are  doing.<br />I figure some of the so-called witches etc. are not what they  purport to be, just as some of the agressive so-called Christians driving  with bumper stickers that advertise their &quot;faith&quot;  are not what  they purport to be.  I recommend Adler's book if you are interested in  comparative religion, are looking for a new way of living or just curious  about a somewhat maligned and often persecuted group of mostly women.	2000-08-03

On Sunday 7/30/00, The New York Times carried a review of &quot;The Moral Obligation to be Intelligent&quot; -- an article by Edward Rothstein entitled, &quot;Dated? Perhaps, But His Insights Remain Powerful&quot; --  Rothstein's insights are useful and I agree with most of them, but I found  more than Rothstein had space or inclination to address.<br />Trilling's  essays cover the core moral issues 19th and early 20th century writers  addressed--fascism, communism, pornography, evil, the nature of beauty, the  existence and nature of God. While the book focuses on the thoughts and  writing of mostly dead white males (and Jane Austen), the struggle  continues, and we all have a moral responsibility to be actively informed.<br />I bought this book because it contained two essays on Jane Austen of  whom I am excessively fond. One of these essays, &quot;Mansfield  Park&quot;, addresses her most controversial book. Trilling wrote  &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; because he believed the book has had been  mischaracterized by those who disliked Fanny Price.<br />Trilling discusses a  major moral issue in this essay--one many &quot;sophisticated&quot; people  deliberately ignore--irony can be evil. He says that &quot;In irony, even  in the large derived sense of the word, there is a kind of malice.&quot; He  suggests there may have been malice on the part of Austen when she engaged  in irony. But, he suggests, there are two kinds of irony--the detached kind  and the engaged kind. It is the former that is evil because it takes place  at the expense of others, i.e. is not charitable. The other kind of irony  is involved, the user is attempting to meliorate a painful situation within  which she or he finds himself.  An example of the latter is the narrator's  comment in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; -- &quot;it is a truth  universally acknowledged that a single young man in possesion of a good  fortune must be in want of a wife.&quot;  An example of the cruel kind of  irony occurs in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; via Mary Crawford's comments  meant in jest.<br />Trilling suggests the greatness of &quot;Mansfield  Park&quot; is &quot;commensuate with it's power to offend.&quot; He says  whereas &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; celebrates the &quot;traits of  spiritedness, vivacity, celerity, and lightness&quot; and &quot;associates  them with happiness and virtue&quot; Mansfield Park does the opposite.  &quot;Mansfield's Park&quot;'s impulse is not to forgive, but to condemn.  Its praise is not for social freedom, but social constraint. The  condemnation is of the wrong kind of irony, the hurtful kind of irony, the  irony of the uncharitable toward Fanny Price. &quot;The virtue of Fanny  Price is rewarded by more than itself.&quot; It is beyond the pleasure  principle. Remember duty, honor, sacrifice? In the end, Trilling suggests  Fanny Price is a kind of Christian saint like the pale Milly Theale in  James' &quot;Wings of the Dove.&quot;<br />Does it matter?  Are those who  seek goodness fools? He raises this issue and shares what he believes to be  Jane Austen's thoughts on the topic, which he latter expands in &quot;The  Fate of Pleasure.&quot;  Is there something beyond mere pleasure?<br />Keats  thought so.  He said &quot;Truth is Beauty.&quot; But what about evil. Is  evil real? Keats says yes, but so is beauty. The reality of evil does not  cancel the reality of beauty. The world is a terrible place where evil and  beauty lie side by side. Trilling's essay on Keats was so wonderful, it  made me cry.<br />I marked dozens of passages in my book that I wanted to  share, but there is not enough space.  The sections of the essays that I  enjoyed most, other than those on Austen (the second essay was not  completed when Trilling died), coverend the writing of Henry James.  I had  never seen him as the natural heir to Austen.  Now I shall go back and  reread James.  Also, I was pleased to see Trilling trash Theodore Dreiser.  I hated his writing and so apparently did Trilling. A more modern critic  would have done a better job of covering George Elliot--Mary Ann  Evans--certainly &quot;Adam Bede&quot; is a book about morality, but  Trilling did not pay much attention to women or ethnic writers--why I have  to give it 4 stars.  Too bad, they could have added to this discourse, but  don't let that prevent your reading this fine book.his writing and so apparently did Trilling.

I don't know what book the other reviewer read, but it couldn't have been &quot;Mansfield Park.&quot;  &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; is a political satire according to some, and I think there's reason to believe this  assessment. According to Jane Austen, &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; is about  ordination (some dispute here, but she wrote it in a letter).  Ordination  comes from the word &quot;order&quot; and given the events in Europe at the  time order was a major issue.<br />Jane Austen's father had 'interests' in the  West Indies from which he derived income, and he was very pleased the  British Government (Tories) defended these colonies and kept them from  joining in the American Revolotion. Jane Austen had two naval brothers who  served as part of the effort to keep the English interests en tact. In  &quot;Persuasion&quot; a discussion at dinner one evening centers around  the West Indies--and the talk is not about slavery. Like it or not, Jane  Austen's conscience about slavery did become manifest until she wrote  &quot;Emma&quot; and even then she barely touched on the subject. Jane  Austen's main concerns involved the lives of women and their place in  society. And we have no right to judge her from our perspective 200 years  later.<br />Jane Austen was a Tory at the time she wrote &quot;Mansfield  Park.&quot; The Tories were a conservative party that backed the English  king and he had no interest in seeing English colonies in the West  Indies--from which he derived income--disappear. The Tories were landed  gentry (country aristocrats) and did not want their old agrarian way of  life abolished. It was under threat from the Industrial Revolution, and  other social change. The Tory opposition party was Whig.  Whigs supported  the American and French Revolutions, and wanted change (the Abolutionists  were mostly Whig).<br />Jane Austen's &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; symbolizes  the old agrarian landed gentry way of life. Portsmouth (where Fanny's  mother lives) represents the chaos of the masses.  London (home of the  Crawfords) is an interesting but dangerous way of life.<br />Fanny is a very  moral girl. My only complaint of Fanny is that I wanted her to stand up for  herself--which she does. She always did, she just didn't do it the way we  women who have been emancipated would. Critics from Lionel Trilling to Tony  Tanner have defended Fanny's right to be Fanny--i.e. a moral and good girl  of her times. We who are caught up in the modern world may not appreciate  Fanny, but there she is--and who dares judge her?<br />Fanny holds the course  (like the Tories).  She is the voice of morality who objects to the London  stage play the other youngsters at Mansfield Park stage in the absence of  Mr. Bertram (the lord of the manor and the upholder of virtue). Fanny will  not be coerced into violating her principles. She will not marry Mr.  Crawford because she can see he is immoral. She chides Edmund to stay on  the straight and narrow. She facilitates Edmund's remaining on the path to  ordination. Say what you will, Fanny gets her man, and she gets him the way  she wants him. Was Janie spoofing us all along?

It's a bit too action-packed for me, something that probably appeals more to male readers. I intend to hand this to my husband and ask him what he  thinks. He'll probably like it--right down to the little cutie  stripper-girlfriend.<br />I am old enough to have actually read Agatha  Christie's novels when she was still alive and publishing them, so my age  may also be a factor in my preferences. I like mysteries that linger over  the afternoon tea, describe the surroundings in detail, occur in exotic  locations, and conrast civilized behaviour with horror (i.e., make you feel  secure in your little armchair by the fire away from the big bad world out  there).  And please, show women as threatented or already dead--no torture  scenes for me please.<br />Mr. Pearson seems to be a whiz at  telecommunications tecnology, and his digressions on this subject and the  connection to his plotline are interesting (I'm retired from AT&amp;T so I  may be biased). Some of Boldt's scenes with the other male police could  have been edited. His interaction with various female characters is  relatively entertainining. Boldt reminds me of many men I have known. So  many women, so little time.  Mathews may be beautiful, but she is either an  egomaniac or a dumb cop --psychologist or not. Geez, I realize the book has  to have some action (female victim saved by big boy cop), but why are women  cops in novels so dumb?<br />This was my first Ridley Pearson book and I  think one must read the earlier books to get some of the connections  between characters. This is true for books by Patricia Cornwall and Deborah  Crombie--but I have read all their books and know the history of the main  characters. I don't care enough about Ridley's characters to go back and  read his earlier books.	2000-07-24

Images of maps, bits of geography float through this excellent story of four generations of women--Margaret, Hilda, Danielle, and Sophia. Margaret is a nurse in Saskatchewan when she meets her future husband Davis, a Scots  immigrant searching for his fortune in the new world. Davis, felled by a  fever, changes course and settles down as a farmer-husband-parent. Daughter  Hilda chooses to move onto Toronto where she makes a different kind of life  with an antiques dealer. Margaret's granddaughter Danielle leaves her  mother Hilda and migrates to Paris where she meets Osman, a dealer in  antique oriental rugs. After Danielle dies, Osman and their two children  Sasha and Sophia move to New York to begin again.<br />On the surface, the  stories of these women's lives do not contain obvious morals or seem to  have a purpose other than their recounting. However, this is a tale not  only of shifting landscape, but of the search for one's place in the  geography of the heart. It puts me in mind of the short-story novels of  Alice Munro--'Friend of My Youth' or 'Lives of Girls and Women.' The  richness of the text is like a Bazaar.  Colorful and original images  abound--the grandmother who is bent like a cipher and feels like a raspy  husk when she hugs you; the former library-cum crater, filled with  mushrooms feeding on mouldering books and lined with Queen Anne's Lace; the  little boxes filled with copper pennies turned green, stacked and hidden  behind the old kitchen stove--and rugs, maps, and mellow old wooden  antiques. Bacon's writing is as rich as the antique Yatak pictured on the  book jacket.	2000-07-21

In &quot;A Rock Garden in the South&quot; Ms. Lawrence returns to her greatest strength. I don't think anyone has ever understood rock gardens as  well as Ms. Lawrence. And if you're concerned about water scarcity and  drought, knowing about rock gardening is quite pragmatic.<br />Although the  book was written some time ago, and released after her death, it was edited  by Nancy Goodwin and Allen Lacy, so the contents are solid and up to date.  The contents read somewhat like an annotated plant list, but Ms. Lawrence  writes beautiful prose so it's not at all dry and boring. In fact, her  writing is useful and entertaining.<br />Ms. Lawrence believed you could make  a rock garden almost anywhere--even if you didn't have rocks.  The key is  to plant things that will grow in your area.  Most of her writing in this  book is useful for the middle South -- Zones 6-8 -- but if you look at a  garden book showing the USDA growing zones you'll see they extend clear  across the country.<br />The book contains a great deal of information about  plants and their likes and dislikes.  There are no photographs, this is  solid text, however, if I want to know what something looks like I find a  catalog from Wayside Gardens and poke around. Some of the more esoteric  items may not be pictured in any garden catalog with photos, but sometimes  it's worth the gamble to just try something on faith.<br />Several pages  showing plant requirements (will it work in dry shade?), as well as sources  for seed exchanges and nurseries are located in the back of the book.	2000-07-18

How long has it been  since you stopped to smell the roses?<br />The most striking passage for me  was Ms McGreevy's thoughts on perfectus negativis. This occurs when you  cannot see the beauty in your own garden.  Others pick out and admire  something, but all you can see is the bare patch or the weed at twenty  paces.  Ms. McGreevy says you should see the bare patch as the bit of  unworked canvas in your painting, and instead of noticing the clover in the  petunias, notice the petunias.<br />I have a beautiful garden.

Just above her grave in Wincester Cathedral is written, &quot;In the beginning was the word...&quot;  I am convinced that no one has ever written English prose narrative as well as Jane Austen. In her book, 'Jane  Austen, Obstinate Heart' Valerie Grosvenor Myer takes the reader behind the  scenes into the private life of this remarkable author.  Using  correspondence, diaries, and the memoirs of Jane Austen and her family and  friends, Ms. Myer constructs a biography that helps the reader understand  Austen's day-to-day existence 200 years ago--the environment that formed  her and inspired her creative process.<br />She lived a life of genteel  poverty--barely made genteel by the kindness of her brothers and friends.  She worked hard--in an age when the mangle was just invented, irons were  heated on the fireplace, and woman's work was never done, she and her  mother and sister could not always get the help they needed. She worried  about money, reworked old clothes to make them last, lacked good food at  times, was cold at times, and wanted for many material comforts. And yet,  she managed without the aid of a computer or even a typewriter, to produce  six of the world's greatest novels.<br />This book will appeal to women more  so than men because it concerns issues that have affected women more. Most  women have faced some form of discrimination or deprivation, or know of the  deprivation of other women--lack of food, lack of clothing, fear,  depression, an inability to control one's reproductive life, and poverty.  Austen was aware of women's struggles--her own and those of family and  friends. She watched five sisters-in-law succomb to early deaths owing to  childbearing.<br />Austen's books center on the struggles of heroines to make  lives for themselves in what is essentially a man's world. Although this  book doesn't discuss Austen's books in any depth, it certainly illuminates  the links between the life of the author and her characters.  It's an  excellent book.  It made me cry.llent book.  It made me cry.	2000-07-17

She was born in 1775, the year of the American Revolution, lived through the French Revolution, the Jacobin 'Terror' and the Age of Napoleon, and died just after Waterloo.  The quiet English countryside she knew and loved became imperiled by many factors during her lifetime.<br />Tanner, a reader at Cambridge, has written an insightful literary criticism about the seven novels Austen wrote (Sandition was incomplete at the time of her death). His book is written for the 'close' reader of Austen's work. I was introduced to his text in one of my courses on Austen.<br />For example, in his chapter on 'Mansfield Park' Tanner lays out the underpinnings of the story as one of conflict between the order of the rural countryside (Mansfield Park) versus the disorder of Portsmouth and the corrupting influence of London. Various characters stand for these places as well as the moral failings of society.  The three sisters Mrs. Price (lust) represents Portsmouth, Mrs Norris (envy) and Mrs. Bertram (sloth) represent Mansfield Park on the verge of breakdown. The Crawfords (avarice) interlopers from London, reprent the alluring but treacherous ways of urban life. Fanny, Edmund, and Mr. Bertram represent the ordered rural life.<br />When asked what &quot;Mansfield Park' was about, Ms. Austen replied it was about &quot;ordination.&quot; The word ordination comes from the Latin word--ordo. Tanner says Ms. Austen, concerned &quot;with the problem of how a true social order could be maintained, particularly in a troubled period, clearly considered the role of the clergyman as being of special importance.&quot;<br />Tanner says Mansfield Park is loaded with symbolism. For example, on a group walk Fanny stays on the straight and narrow path by remaining stationary on a bench, while Edmund and Mary Crawford walk the Serpintine path. Maria and Julia stray from the cultivated garden into the &quot;wilderness&quot; behind the iron gate with Henry Crawford.<br />Fanny Price wears an amber cross, a gift from her beloved brother William. She hangs it on a gold chain given her by Edmund. Wearing these two gifts over her heart gives her &quot;inner peace.&quot;<br />Fanny is the center of the story.  Although many readers may perceive her as a prig, she is a very complex character. She is Austen's source of Good Orderly Direction. At the end, Mr. Bertram the &quot;lord&quot; of Mansfield Park recognizes her as his &quot;true&quot; daughter.nny Price wears an amber cross, a gift from her beloved brother William.

I read 'The Prince of Pleasure' by Saul David because I am fascinated with the Regency Period in England, the French Revolution, and Jane Austin's writing. Partly biography and mostly very good historical research  (letters, journals, diaries), the book provides excellent background  information on architecture (the Pavillion at Brighton, townhouses in  London); clothing (Empire waistlines, Beau Brummel); Luddite rebellions and  starving workers in Glasgow; the Duke of Wellington and Waterloo; and  Nelson, the British Navy, and Trafalgar. Mostly, I read the book because I  love Jane Austen and want to know all I can about her times.<br />Saul David  says that next to Walter Scott, Jane Austen was the Duke of Wales' (Prince  Regent and eventually George IV) favorite novelist.  Ms Austen did not  reciprocate his feelings. In one of her letters, Austen said of Princess  Caroline, the wife the Duke was attempting to divorce and/or put away,  &quot;I shall support her as long as I can because she is a Woman, and  because I hate her husband...[If] I must give up the Princess, I am  resolved at least always to think that she would have been respectable, if  the Prince had behaved tolerably by her at first.&quot;<br />When she visited  Carlton House (one of the Royal residences) in November 1815, the librarian  informed Austen of the Regent's admiration for her work. By this knowledge  she was coerced into dedicating her next novel 'Emma' to the Prince Regent.<br />But she had earlier expressed her poor opinion of the Prince indirectly  in 'Mansefield Park.'  In what David describes as a &quot;thinly veiled  criticism&quot; she set a scene where a crises is precipated by the absence  of the 'Lord' of the Manor, Sir Thomas Bertram (like George III) and the  reckless follies of his oldest son Tom, &quot;who takes over the 'regency'  from his brother Edmund...[and like the Regent Prince] &quot;loves to  gamble, live well and run up debts.&quot;  When Tom becomes the 'Regent' of  Mansfield Park, he &quot;prefers the ceremonial to the practical aspects of  government.&quot;  The subversive conclusion of 'Mansefield Park' &quot;is  that the younger son is a more suitable regent that the legal heir, while  the poor female relation (Fanny Price) is preferable to them  both.&quot;<br />My goodness, it's a wonder they didn't try Ms. Austen for  Sedition.

I started reading &quot;The Daughters of Simon Lamoreaux&quot; and  couldn't put it down. I finished the book in one sitting--well I did get up  to stretch once in a while and eat, but that was it. If you like  beautifully written stories with fine characterization, a great plot, and a  strong sense of place, you will enjoy this book.<br />Miles Fanning and Julia  Lamoreaux are the only survivors of a tragedy that occurred 24 years  earlier when they were teenagers. Both of them  suffered psychological  damage following the mysterious disappearance of Julia's sister Carolyn  (Carly) who was Miles 17 year-old girl friend.<br />Carly was supposed to get  together with Miles during a lunch break the day she disappeared, but she  never arrived at the meeting place. Was she a runaway, was she abducted?  The mystery remains unsolved and Carly's disappearance profoundly affects  the lives of those who love her--her parents, her sister, and Miles.<br />After Carly's disappearance, Miles appears to go on with his life. He  graduates from high school, attends the University of Michigan where he  majors in journalism, and ends up directing a Windom House type music  recording business in Seattle. He marries the beautiful Kyra who bears a  physical resemblance to Carly. But Miles is an insomniac workaholic who has  never addressed the terrible emotional consequences of Carly's  disappearance<br />Carly's younger sister Julia suffers a similar fate.  24  years later these two damaged souls connect and begin the difficult process  of unraveling the past, facing old ghosts, and experiencing the healing of  old wounds.<br />Davin Long's story is an extremely well written  psychological tale with a Hitchcock twist, fantastic dialogue, and  beautiful imagery that provides a lyrical beat. I will read other works by  this author.	2000-07-10

I read the book and found it interesting but depressing. &quot;Diaries&quot; was a tale told through an older dead woman's diaries.<br />&quot;A Recipe for Bees&quot; follows a similiar approach, but it's a  very different book. It left me feeling reflective, but it also left me  with a sense of serenity. God's in his heaven and all's right with the  world, when love, forgiveness and acceptance make it so.<br />&quot;A Recipe  for Bees&quot; opens one afternoon as Augusta Olsen, a woman in her 70's,  arrives home after a difficult rail trip. Augusta's daughter Joy has  dispatched her from the hospital where Joy's husband is undergoing brain  surgery. The book ends 5-6 hours later, sometime after dinner when the fate  of Joy's beekeeper husband is known. During that period Augusta reflects  over her life.<br />&quot;A Recipe for Bees&quot; is as skillfully woven as  the rugs Augusta's mother Helen once made--pulling strands of colored wool  through pieces of burlap backing. One of Helen's rugs had a large pink rose  woven into the center. This beautiful book is like that rug, a work of art.<br />The book is a love story--of a long marriage. At each turn of events,  the marriage is different. In the beginning, you wonder how Augusta can  stand her life with Karl on the cold comfort farm that killed his own  mother. But Augusta finds ways to cope. She fishes with the pastor of her  church. She finds work in town to earn a little pin money. She takes a  lover, she has a baby, she takes up bee-keeping. The bees are always  hovering in the background.<br />Augusta learned bee-keeping by observing her  mother Helen. When Helen dies, Augusta's father Manny turns out the hives,  a European custom to aid the ascent of the beekeeper's soul. All the swarms  of bees disburse except for one that stays until sunset, clustered in a  ball against the kitchen window. Then &quot;catching the last of the light  [the bees flew] off in a glittering golden-red globe that moved through the  sky as if guided by a single mind.&quot;<br />Helen's bees take up residence  in the abandoned honey shed where she bottled her honey. Decades later,  after experiencing a vision of her mother in the honey shed, Augusta uses  their descendents and her mother's bee-keeping equipment to become a  bee-keeper. Honey, bees, pollen, nectar, and flowers are the metaphors of  Augusta's life.<br />The author has placed a beautiful collection of  photos  of her own Canadian family in this book. Gail Anderson-Dargatz writing is  reminiscent of the tales by Alice Munro.he last of the light  [the bees flew] off in a glittering golden-red globe that moved through the  sky as if guided by a single mind.&quot; <br />Helen's bees take up residence  in the abandoned honey shed where she bottled her honey.

While reading Brooks new book &quot;Bobos in Paradise&quot; I looked up several passages in &quot;Democracy in America&quot; by Alexis de Tocqueville. Sure enough, old Alex had already pointed out some of the  observations Brooks makes, and even cites near the end of his book  --&quot;is the danger that, amid all the constant trivial preoccupations of  private life, ambition may lose both its force and its greatness, that  human passions may grow gentler and at the same time baser, with the result  that the progress of the body social may become daily quieter and less  aspiring.&quot; Brooks may live in DC but it is obvious he doesn't have my  commute with some very ambitious and non-gentle drivers.<br />&quot;Democracy&quot; contains another passage--Brooks does not  cite--having to do with the constant striving of Americans for the almighty  dollar. This image is picked up by Fitzgerald in &quot;The Great  Gatsby&quot; where the green light at the end of Daisy's dock glows and  recedes just out of Gatsby's reach.<br />I suppose I might fall into Brook's  definition of BOBO, except that I am a bit older than his elite group, who  seem to be first wave baby boomers. (Maybe he should have called them  BABOs.) And, I don't drink latte anymore, just tea (really good tea of  course), and I drive a 12-year old Toyota that gets really good gas mileage  (my husband's car is older). Although my husband (now a counselor and  retired from a large corporation) and I fall into the BOBO income group, we  live in what the Claritas corporation calls a &quot;Bohemian&quot;  neighborhood (42 ethnic groups in the local school and very Democratic).  I'm a &quot;sort of&quot; SID (one of my publications is cited on the front  page of the WP this date) but I gave up the rubber-chicken circuit some  years ago and I left a Fortune 500 company to work for a more  &quot;worthy&quot; organization.<br />We compost EVERYTHING organic (great  earthworms), don't grow grass--only herbs and local flora plus a rose bush  or two--have a NWF backyard bird approved yard. We shop at Land's End for  jeans and chinos which we wear to work, and read lots of books. We don't  ski, don't own a boat, and don't eat very much meat(chicken &amp; fish)  thus forgoing gourmet cooking and the need for an &quot;over-the-top&quot;  kitchen). BOBOS live in 1.5 million houses and drive SUVs!  Give me a  break, these guys are NOT bohemian, they are wannabees.<br />Brooks has  written a &quot;pop&quot; sociology book--&quot;The Status Seekers&quot;  come to mind. It's exactly the sort of book that attracts the marketing  class as this book will. One of my professors (I am a French-Marxist  sociologist--trained at a state university--but of course) pointed out 20  years ago that we live in the &quot;Age of McDonaldization.&quot;  U.S.A.  Today is &quot;newsMcnuggets&quot;, Starbucks is  &quot;coffeeMcNuggets&quot;, and Smith and Hawkins is  &quot;EcoMcnuggets.&quot; As soon as any new idea arises it is quickly  scoffed up by the marketing types and developed into a market-worthy items  sold in shops from sea to shining sea (institutionalized), and the result  is a flawed abstraction of the original.<br />What amazes me is how rapidly  the market devolves an idea into various products to meet various market  niches. In the 1960s we burned sandlewood incense for the heck of it. I  don't even know why I did it except my friends were doing it and other Zen  things, and it seemed radical at the time (I wasn't too daring). Today, you  can find sandlewood scent in everything from candles at the boutique,  deodorant for the bathroom, and air freshners in taxis.<br />Brooks fails to  take on a really big issue--one that would give his &quot;fluffy&quot; book  some weight. Who the heck is buying all that cocaine and heroin.  Well, I  have an idea, and I know for a fact that any number of those SUV drivers I  encounter on the road are either on the stuff or something equally  intoxicating.<br/>I don't believe one can be both bohemian and bourgeois.  This is the myth those who have abandoned their &quot;values&quot; tell  themselves to salve their own conscience. You cannot drive an SUV and call  yourself an environmentalist.g. <br />I don't believe one can be both bohemian and bourgeois.

After a year of false starts, I finally read &quot;Death du Jour.&quot;  I found myself a bit disappointed. Kathy Reichs has been compared to Patricia Cornwell, but Kathy Reichs is no Patricia Cornwall. For one thing, Ms  Cornwall  writes exceedingly well. She was a journalist covering the police  beat in Richmond before she began writing crime novels. Her books in some  sense are extensions of these stories.  Cornwall's writing is exceedingly  original and based on real events according to our local papers.<br />Although I liked Ms. Reich's first book &quot;Deja Death&quot; -- mainly  because it took place in Montreal and had an exotic setting -- certain  aspects of it bothered me. I found myself very irritated with Ms. Reich's  second book. Ms Reichs books seem to consist of warmed over material from  other books. While Reichs books may be based on real events, and I am sure  she is a good nonfiction writer, she does not write fiction very well.  For one thing, &quot;Death du Jour&quot; is far too busy. There are too  many characters and not enough character development, too many plot twists  and subplots and not enough development of the central plot.<br />For me, one  of the great attactions of Poirot, Morse, or Kay Scarpetta is the mental  game. 'Du jour' is loaded with action but don't expect much of a mental  game. Sure, I know police work is different from detection, but Cornwall  does both--that's what makes her stories so strong.<br />Also, I like a lead  character I can identify with on some level. One appealing characteristic  of Kay Scarpetta is her ability to reflect. All through her novels Ms.  Cornwall has Scarpetta pull back and reflect. Often she does it over a meal  she has prepared for her sidekick detective.<br />Ms. Reichs character Tempe  Brennan attempts to do this but even when she sits in front of her fire  place she's nervous and twitchy and something is always happening, from  break-ins to fires. Tempe Brennan is very nearly perfect, and she is far to  active and she needs to cut back on the diet coke.<br />Oh somewhere, someone  might try to do everything Tempe does, but I seriously doubt they could do  any of it very well. My willing suspension of disbelief gets pretty  stretched with Tempe. How many times is she going to be beaten, mugged,  burgled, and held prisoner. This is only book two and she's been pretty  battered already. And, she's a fool at times.  She deals with the worst  sort of killer, and refuses to carry a weapon--give me a break.<br />In  &quot;Death du Jour&quot;, over a three week period, Tempe Brennan becomes  involved in some facet or other of investigations into at least ten  suspicious deaths.  These bodies scattered from Canada to Beaufort SC. And  Brennan is teaching a graduate course at UNC, writing papers for a  professional conferences, investigating the bones of a supposed RC saint,  and taking time out for a weekend getogether with her college age daughter.

Some gardening books are about particular gardens, others about favorite plants. Some writers look back over lives of gardening and living and write reflective passages.  Others travel to beautiful gardens that have stood  the test of time and share what they find. This little book does a bit of  all these things.<br />Gardeners will appreciate &quot;People With Dirty  Hands.&quot; While it does not describe the elementary aspects of  gardening, it does take a new angle -- describing some of the action behind  the scene at the local plant nursery.<br />In the past few years, Rosarians  have noticed an explosion in the quality, kind, and appearance of roses. In  a day when hybridizers are splicing genes and bringing all kinds of mutants  into the commercial world, a number of naturalists, gardeners, and  botanists are saying, &quot;Look what we're leaving behind!&quot; Once  lost, the past can never be recovered.<br />&quot;People With Dirty  Hands&quot; follows the adventures of those concerned with saving the past.  The 'Rose Rustlers&quot; are my favorites.  These plant collectors drive  all over the old rural areas, particularly in the plains states (Texsas)  looking for old, abandoned but still thriving roses. The roses can be found  in cemetaries, on fences along the road, and covering the collapsed timbers  of old houses, barns, or pig stys. The 'Rose Rustlers' take grafts from the  old plants and start new plants and pass them along to caring gardeners.  The idea is to propagate the old roses and keep them going.  Some  biologists do this for scientific reasons, but many ordinary gardeners are  joining hands across the nation to keep the old plants alive. They are  saving the past for the future generations.	2000-07-01

Dorothy Sucher is a therapist by trade, and a gardener by avocation.  As I read her book, &quot;The Invisible Garden&quot; I had a sense that she would make a good friend.  She seems to have an appreciation of human  limitations and frailties, and probably lives up to the old axiom &quot;A  friend is someone who forgets your shortcomings.&quot; Well, maybe not  where her husband is concerned, but what can a gardener do with a guy whose  allergic to the great out-of-doors and can't tell a Dandelion from a lily.<br />Ms. Sucher's book is not so much about gardening as it's about coming to  terms with a yourself.  Sure, she cultivates the garden, But she also  understands it's existence is as ephemeral as the life of it's author.<br />Each of us carries our own memories of past gardens. I will always be  reminded of my parents garden in North Carolina when I see daffodils  blooming in the spring. My folks grew thousands of daffodils. I don't think  my father ever met a daffodil he didn't try to grow. And everytime I see a  Brunnera I think of my mother, standing over the little blue flowers and  saying, &quot;What are these things? I can never remember their name!&quot;  We all laughed because it's colloquial name is  &quot;forget-me-not.&quot;<br />The invisible garden consists of the  cumulative memories of gardens past that you carry in your heart.	2000-06-28

Before I read this biography of George III, I knew very little about him. I knew he liked Handel because we were told when we stood up for the Alleluia chorus of the Messiah that we did it because George III set the  precendent way back when. Some of us still stand.<br />I knew that George III  had been depicted as a tyrant by the framers of the Declaration of  Independance.<br />I knew that George III had suffered from an hereditary  disease that caused his urine to run purple, hence it's name<br />I wanted to  know more about George III because I am fascinated with the history of the  French Revolution and the defeat of Napoleon. I wanted to know why George  wasn't rousted from his throne like the French King and the monarchy done  away with.<br />What I discovered about George III was that he was a good  man, a loving father, and a beloved king. I learned he was religious, loved  Handel to excess, and was opposed to slavery. I learned that he had all  kinds of charities, cared about the poor and the sick, and lived relatively  frugally all his life.  He admired the Methodists because of their  &quot;simple&quot; ways, even though he was High Church Anglican. He lived  until he was in his 80's and his madness did not finally put him under  until he was 72.  He had many children, most of whom disappointed him.  He  and his wife spoke German behind closed doors, and he owned lands in  Hanover in Germany.<br />I learned a lot more, and I enjoyed reading this  book even though I wasn't sure I would.  Hibbert writes well, his text is  interesting and his research thorough. The story is about the private life  of George III, so not a lot of political or economic history is discussed  although it is always in the background.

Once upon a time I worked as a docent at Guston Hall (home of the Revolutionary George Mason who who wrote the Fairfax Resolves which became the Virginia and then the U.S. Bill of Rights).<br />Located in Fairfax  Country Virginia, Gunston Hall is a lovely place with extensive grounds  whose plants reside in a climate a shade cooler (Zone 7) than Williamsburg  Virginia (Zone 8), and hotter than Monticello (Zone 6). Mr. Mason and Mr.  Jefferson were friends who exchanged information on gardening in  Virgina.<br />Unfortunately, most of what the maintenance staff grew in these  historical gardens 30 years ago wasn't very historical, but things have  changed. Archeologists have excavated the garden beds and identified seeds  discovered in the old earth, and from them been able to deduce what grew  200-300 years ago. Also, the correspondance, business papers, and gardening  diaries of the gardeners have been used to determine the layout and design  as well as daily events in the annual growth cycle.

Her book is well illustrated  with beautiful photographs. Ms. Heffner's selection of gardens includes  parlor gardens of the 19th century, Mission gardens of the West, and the  Medieval Herb Garden of Europe -- a replica of which can be found in The  Cloisters of the Metropolitan Musem of Art in New York. Williamsburg,  Monticello and other famous gardens are not featured.<br />Ms. Heffner's  selection criteria has more to do with pluralism than anything else  (corn-bean-maize from the Ameican Indians, okra and greens from the  Africans, and Mission gardens planted by Spanish Indians). On the one hand,  if you're looking for a way to restore a colonial bed based on the  &quot;Dutch&quot; gardens at Williamsburg you may be disappointed. On the  other hand, the book could be used in a classroom setting and most children  would not feel excluded.<br />While her selection of garden layouts and plant  designs is adequate for the beginner, the plants themselves require an  intermediate knowledge of gardening. The photographs show the plants  co-existing in perfect harmony. They don't. Some are thugs--take Gooseneck  Loosestrife for example. Goodness it's pretty in the middle of summer as it  holds it's own against heat and drought. However, if you give it an inch,  it will take a mile.

Did you ever wonder what would have happened if Romeo and Juliette had been able to work it out? Although not many 15-year olds who've known each other for three days have had successful relationships, let alone  marriages, what if Romeo and Juiette were older--a lot older.<br />This is  love story about an older Julie(tte) and Romeo, rival florist-shop owners  whose parents were Hatfields and McCoys, Guelphs and Ghibbilines--feuding  parties named Roseman and Cacciamania. From poisoning rose bushes and  snapping the heads off unoffending daffodils, to placing dead fish or  buckets of fleas on enemy premises in the dead of night, these warring  parties have done it all.<br />One day, Julie Roseman and Romeo Cacciamania  meet at a business conference. Sparks fly, one thing leads to another and  before you can say &quot;here's pansies that's for thoughts&quot; they are  discovered naked in the Cacciamania florist shop in the middle of the night  by Romeo's son. All hell breaks loose as the rest of the family members  discover what these two love birds have been up to.<br />Will the lovers  overcome the divisions and distractions that have occupied their clans for  generations. Will they be able to fend off outraged children and  ex-spouses?  Will their chance of happiness be ruined by a 90-year old rose  assassain called Mama?<br />To find out, take this book on your next flight,  or to the beach. I read it in 6 hours, and found it absolutely  delightful--rather like a Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan movie when both of them  are 60 years old.<br />There are chick flicks, and this is probably a chick  book.  Since I am near the age of the protagonists I could identify. I  don't know if younger folks would enjoy it or not. It really depends on  whether you think old folks can still &quot;do it&quot;.	2000-06-24

In the early part of the 20th Century, Virginia Wolfe wrote in &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; that women needed to kill the Angel in the house. She was referring to a woman's propensity to care for family members at the  expense of herself--and in Wolfe's case--sacrifice her writing.<br />Although  middle class women don't have a lock on being the &quot;Angel&quot; in the  house, they are the audience Wolfe was speaking to -- educated women who  might want to do something with their lives other than be the chief cook  and bottle washer in charge of maintenance and repair.<br />Daisy Lewis  eventually learns how to take care of herself, but she certainly takes her  time getting there. When Daisy isn't handling complaints at the supermarket  where she works as ombudsman (&quot;Why not ombudswoman?&quot; asks her  friend), she's organizing food banks, washing her college son's dirty  laundry, cleaning up her husband's vomit and other excrescences, or hosting  foreign students for Harvard.<br />On one level, the book title refers the  family that hosts foreign students, but on another level, it refers to the  &quot;hosts&quot; that attract parasites and viruses--organic and manmade.  Daisy's ex-husband Henri (nee Henry) is a computer virus expert and a bit  of a parasite himself. Daisy's new beau is a parasitologist who isn't a  parasite but he brings them home.<br />I found the book entertaining, and  read it in two sittings. I laughed out loud once, but the text is amusing  and others may laugh more. I love wordsmithing, and was most entertained by  Medwed's command of English (English majors should love this book). Her  wordplay is as graceful as a trapeze act. A familiarity with literature,  world affairs, and internatinal cuisine will probably make many of the  book's wry comments and asides more understandable.	2000-06-23

In spite of the depressing content the book is well written. Although many persist in seeing external events as the cause of  drinking to excess, the reality that alcoholism is a disease, and drinking  to excess often causes external eventsto happen (loss of spouse, loss of  job, loss of life). And, external events become an excuse for the drinker  to go on drinking.<br />I know something about alcoholics having lived with a  few of them. Alcoholics I know &quot;in recovery&quot; tell me they use any  excuse to drink.  This I think is the story of &quot;Charming  Billy.&quot;<br />When I read the book, I was especially sensitive to the  writer's &quot;take&quot; on alcoholism.  I do not think she uses Billy's  rejection by the Irish nanny as an excuse for Billy's drinking. I think  Billy already had a problem with alcohol when he met Eva. In fact, it's  possible Eva may have recognized the symptoms and made her decision based  on what she observed. Alcoholism is a scourge of the Irish (Angela's  Ashes).<br />The book faithfully depicts the decline of an alcoholic who never  finds recovery. His family members are left with the puzzle of what went  wrong, how did he reach such a bad end. Blaming the ex-fiance is the easy  way to deal with their own feelings of inadequacy, as well as feelings of  guilt for an illness over which they have no control.<br />The author writes  well and deserved her reward. The content of the book is difficult and not  for those seeking a &quot;good read&quot; on a rainy Sunday afternoon.	2000-06-21

Because &quot;When Christ and His Saints Slept&quot; is a work of fiction, some history lovers interested in Henry II might find it unacceptable. I like historical fiction as well as the &quot;real&quot; stuff, and I wanted  to know more about Queen Maude--Henry II's mother so I read this book.  Penman is a good historian, and what makes her book fiction is not that she  alters fact, but that she literally puts words in people's mouths that they  may or may not have said.<br />If you like historical fiction because of a  love story angle, this book may prove a bit disappointing. On the other  hand, the verismilitude of the life of the times (cold castles, dirt, poor  food) is more real than any history could make it. One can say, &quot;they  ate poorly&quot; or one can describe in detail the quality and kind of the  food eaten as well as the dining actors. Also, we really don't know what  peole said in private moments and thought when riding on horseback alone.  Penman speculates and builds her speculation on the information at hand.<br />This book provides excellent background for Ellis Peters' fans. Here,  you can actually obtain an idea of what's going on between Maude and  Stephen through the course of Peters' 20 Brother Cadfael mysteries, as  first one then another of the royal sides sweeps through Shrewsbury. You  can also understand why Cadfael (Peters aka Pargeter-her real name) remains  neutral. I found it rather amusing that at one point in Penman's book a  character traveling in the vicinity and seeking medical aid for a wounded  comrade mentions a certain 'brother' in the Shrewsbury abby of Saints Peter  and Paul who is known for his healing skills.<br />The book switches back and  forth between Maude and Stephen, and one can develop sympathies for both  but I have and continue to side with Maude. Maude was rightfully the heir  to the throne, and it was taken from her by men who did not want to be  ruled by a woman. Fortunately, by the time of Queen Elizabeth I this  attitude had ameliorated somewhat. Apparently Stephen did not really want  to be king, but he let himself be goaded into it which says much about his  dissimulation or his weak nature or both. One can sympathize with Stephen  not because he is in the right, but because he is portrayed as one who step  by step slides down a slippery slope and becomes something alien to  himself. If he had understood where he would end up, perhaps he would not  have taken the first step.<br />Maude never regains her throne, but in the end  the throne of England is won by her son, Henry II who apparently became a  first-class ruler.  The book ends as Henry II triumps over Stephen's  forces.en Elizabeth I this  attitude had ameliorated somewhat.

As I read the first 50 pages of this book, I kept dozing off, and then around page 90 was shocked by a very big secret that kept me reading until another secret was revealed, and then another, and then I was caught like a  lobster in a pot and read the whole book in two sittings. The plot line of  this book is very unpredictable--an original drama to say the  least.<br />&quot;Stern Men&quot; will be compared to &quot;The Shipping  News&quot; but I didn't laugh as hard, though Gilbert's writing is clever  and her observations wry. The protagonist is a female who pretty much stays  where she was born, not a male who leaves home. Also, the disappearing  culture of lobster men and their families is different from the tourist  town culture depicted in &quot;News.&quot; Where Annie Proulx introduced  each chapter of her book with a little epigram on knot tying, Gilbert  introduces each chapter in her book with a relevant blurb on lobsters that  seems somehow to mirror Ruth's life.<br />The book will also be compared to  &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot; because the characters live in an island  community where everyone knows everyone and there are ethnic overtones  (Swedes on Courne Haven Island and Italians and Scots Irish on Ft. Niles).  All the locals rely on fishing for a living, and like the seamen in  &quot;Snow&quot; there are petty rivalries that result in  death.<br />&quot;When I was a child I spoke as a child.&quot;  In the  beginning of the book, Ruth sees the world as a child would, and tries to  make sense of it from a child's perspective. The text and dialogue reflect  her childish thoughts in short direct sentences. She learns to hide under  the kitchen table and become invisible. As Ruth matures, her thoughts and  the book become more complex.  On occasion Ruth still hides.<br />Stern Men  are the men who go out to sea with the lobster fishermen. They are the  second fiddles who supply the physical strength to haul the lobster pots up  and down. They are essential, they do the grunt work, but they are not the  masters of their own fates. Many of the stern men eventually become the  masters of their own ships. Stern men is an analagy for Ruth's maternal  lineage. In the beginning they are pretty much taking orders and doing the  grunt work. By the end, Ruth is the master of her own destiny.are essential, they do the grunt work, but they are not the  masters of their own fates.

Charleston South Carolina is a beautiful place, but the thing I like the best about that little city is the gardens. Every garden has containers, and every house seemed to have window boxes or containers on porches. The  British also seem to have a penchant for growing plants in containers. The  alleys that lie behind the houses in Royal Tunbridge Wells are loaded with  potted plants.<br />It you are a potted plant fancier like me, this is the  book for you.  This is a fine book, a beautiful book, a heavy book.  Physically, it probably belongs on the coffee table -- it's too pretty to  take out back and smear with manure and sand as you try to replicate the  various contained gardens. On the other hand, this book is destined to be  outside, it's extremely useful in the garden.<br />Containers are not just for  apartment dwellers with balconies. As my yard fills up with this and that,  and I look for new ways to hold plants, I have looked up.  Contained  gardens can be plopped on the patio or into the middle of a patch, but they  can also be hung or mounted on walls, porch or balcony railings, and under  windows.<br />Containers can be the familiar red clay pot or the familiar red  clay pot with a paint job. This book tells you how to paint your pots,  shape your boxes, or mold your 'stone-like' containers. Almost anything can  be a container with the right preparation.<br />And what to plant? This book  indicates the only constraint is your imagination. To get your imagination  going, the book contains multiple diagrams that show you which plants to  use, how to plant them and other necessary instructions. The back of the  book contains a long list of plants suitable for container growing. Each  item in the list is described in several paragraphs.<br />The book gives you  information for growing things all year round. I have been exchanging my  pansies for summer plants every year, but next spring, I intend to grow  bulbs in containers.	2000-06-17

I stumbled onto this book because it was featured in the Washington Post in a column written by Adrian Higgins (Henry Mitchell's sucessor). A photograph of the Austrian Copper rose accompanied the article (the cover),  and I'm a sucker for burnt-orange, so I followed up on the book. I am very  pleased with it.<br />Although the cover is paper, it's a plasticized paper  and a sturdy book. I mention this first, because I will refer to the book  often, it feels pleasant to hold in the hand, it's easy to carry, and it  can get a little moisture on the outside and not crumble.<br />I'm tired of  having my roses eaten alive every spring, so I decided to pull out all the  hybrids and fall back and regroup. This book takes me back to the old roses  that are a little more hardy and can put up with Washington DC weather  patterns.<br />The book is nicely laid out. A front section entitled,  &quot;What Makes an Old Rose&quot; describes how old roses came to be. The  next section is a &quot;field guide&quot; to help you distinguish roses at  the nursery. This is followed by 168 pages of roses and text from 'Alba  Semi-Plena' to 'Zephrine Drouhin.'<br />What makes this book unique as well as  useful is the layout. Each rose is covered in a two-page section. A text  description is on the right-hand page, and a closeup photograph of a  specimin of the rose showing the bloom, buds, and leaf and branch structure  is on the left-hand side. Because it's an actual photo, one can identify  the rose in question more easily.<br />The text is useful. Not only are you  provided a nice historical write-up on the rose, you are given the  'demographics' including the uses, fragrance, and suseptibility to  diseases. Many of the roses appear to be relatively disease free and  fragrant--and I found all of them except the &quot;green&quot; rose  beautiful.<br />The back of the book contains a list of mail-order houses and  gardens where the specimins can be viewed. Since I live in the DC area, I  have acces to the U.S. National Arboretum and Woodlawn Plantation, but  locations for viewing old roses are located in most states.I  have acces to the U.S. National Arboretum and Woodlawn Plantation, but  locations for viewing old roses are located in most states.	2000-06-17

Maybe I'm suffering from selective perception, but is seems there has been an upsurge in books on Holland, Tulips, Dutch artists, and other Dutch lore.<br />Having had four great-grandparents born in the Netherlands  (Groningen and Sint Maartansdyke in Zeeland), who immigrated to the United  States to settle in Holland Michigan in the 19th Century, I'm a big fan of  all things Dutch.<br />I'm also a big fan of Dutch art.  I've visited many of  the major musuems in the the U.S. and Europe, and seen much Dutch art.  I've also had the wonderful experience of seeing a Vermeer retrospective  and many of Vermeer's 35 paintings, some of them many times. I've also  studied art history. So, I was primed to like this book.<br />However, I  didn't. It's not a bad book, it just doesn't live up to the hype on the  jacket and in the reviews posted here and elsewhere. Maybe I should be glad  it was so short and not terribly expensive, but Susan Vreeland writes well,  and I wanted more--more plot OR more character developement OR more art  history.<br />I'm a very big fan of short stories. Either this book is a  collection of short stories strung together with the artful device of a  painting passed from owner to owner. Or, the book is a novel.  If it is a  collection of short stories, the plots are lacking. If it is a novel,  character development is an issue.<br />Maybe the book would have worked  better if there had been fewer stories, or the plots were less predictable.  Perhaps it would have been better if there had been more of an overlap in  the various plots so that what is a subplot in one story becomes the main  plot in another.<br />Since the book is short, it can be read in one sitting  but it may leave you wishing you had devoted your afternoon reading another  book.	2000-06-16

Having spent most of my life traveling hither and thither, I learned that even inside the U.S. you often need a translator--even if you're both speaking English. My yankee cousins drank pop or soda, but in the South, we  drank coke.<br />Bryson says the most common vowel sound in English is the  &quot;schwa&quot; sound shown in dictionaries as the inverted e -- the 'i'  in animal; the 'e' in enough' etc. But how can this be when 'enough' is  pronounced &quot;n'uff&quot; and &quot;E'nuff&quot; as well as  &quot;eh'nuff&quot; -- (just a few of the accentuations in Virginia).<br />Early on I developed a sensitivity to my spoken accent because Yankees  and other Americans have always looked down on southern speech. Then, I  read that the English spoken in the South was almost identical to the  English spoken in 16th Century England -- because the U.S. South was a  backwater for hundreds of years, and the language was relatively  unadulterated by more recent forms of English.<br />But a professor at West  Virginia University wrote that he had uncovered over 100 English dialects  in Virginia alone, and could tell exactly which  village in England was the  source of the dialect. Just how do you pronounce 'Norfolk' -- the English  way of course --Norfuck. Visited the Duke of Gloucester Street in  Williamsburg lately?<br />Bryson's book discusses the rules of English  grammar--which it seems are really the rules and terminology of Latin. Oh  we've had many an argument about split infinitives in our office (we  develop publications).  Did you ever wonder why you can't split an  infinitive?  Well it's because the infinitive form in Latin (as well as the  romance languages) is one word--and it can't be split. The Spanish say  &quot;leer&quot; and the English say &quot;to read&quot; -- Now, why can't  you split that sucker?<br />Not only is English being exported around the  world, English absorbs everything it touches. But for Spanish terms, there  would be no dialog in &quot;Western&quot; movies. Cowboys can't function  without lassos, broncos, chaps, rodeos, canyons, or pumas. And even the  venerable &quot;buckaroo&quot; is just the cowboy way of saying  &quot;vaccaro&quot; -- the Spanish for cowboy.<br />If you ask for a  &quot;chocolate cookie&quot; did you know you are using Aztec and Dutch  words?

Wilder wrote a number of books that made her America's answer to England's Miss Jekyll. Where Miss Jekyll informed the landed gentry, Mrs.  Wilder informed the less landed Yankees.<br />This book covers a year in the  life of her garden Balderbrae--a summer home she and her husband owned and  developed in New York state. Although a book written in 1918 might strike  one as non-relevant to modern homeowners with smaller grounds, it is not.  &quot;Color in My Garden&quot; still resonates with wonderful ideas.<br />Mrs.  Wilder was an artist who created three-dimensional art with live plants of  varying colors, textures, heights, and scents. She not only had an esthetic  sensibility, she was a horticulturalist who understood the nature of her  medium. Her descriptions of plants and her garden designs are still  relevant. Many of her ideas have been copied--over and over--but most of  the copies are not as striking as the original.<br />Mrs. Wilder believed  lighting was a critical element of garden beauty. She was one of the first  persons to develop a white garden and a scented garden for moonlight  nights. She also developed gardens that looked best at high noon in summer.  She understood that light changes all year as well as all day, and that  even moonlight varies with the seasons.<br />Some of her plant combinations  included Lillies and Irises, Hollyhocks and Delphinium, and Red Poppies and  White Valarian. Since her grounds consisted of many plots, one could  replicate a particular beds in a small yard. I have planted Red Poppies  with White Yarrow in a small urban garden.<br />Lately, I've read many  articles and pieces describing garden thugs--a term I first saw in Allen  Lacey's &quot;Garden in Autumn.&quot;  Mrs. Wilder called them outlaws many  years ago. I would have given this book 5 stars, but the illustrations are  not terrific--they're pretty, but are watercolors that may disappoint the  snapshot-camera-loving reader.hat may disappoint the  snapshot-camera-loving reader.	2000-06-14

If you've reached the stage in your garden education where you're a Master Gardener or the self-taught equivalent, you will be ready for &quot;A Garden of One's Own&quot; by Elizabeth Lawrence (1904-85). Ms Lawrence was  a landscape architect, botanist, horticulturist, and garden writer who  lived and worked in North Carolina. The editors, Scott and Ward have  compliled and distilled her writings from many sources (magazines, letters,  plant society bulletins) into a useful resource.<br />Although &quot;A  Garden of One's Own&quot; contains a section dedicated to gardeners in the  Middle South as well as a nice essay on William Lanier Hunt, it is not just  for those living in the Piedmont area of North Carolina. The book is filled  with information Ms Lawrence exchanged with plant collectors and gardeners  as far away as the northwest coast of the U.S. Many plants that grow well  in the Piedmont area of North Carolina can also be viable futher north, in  the upper South, and in various higher altitude areas on the Pacific coast.  As Ms Lawrence says, the growing zones extend across the country.<br />I have  always found Ms Lawrence's exchanges with folks in Ohio (colder), Missippi  (hotter), and other parts of the country quite informative. I do believe  she must have been one of the first writers to educate the lay public about  the effects of climate and growing conditions on  garden plants. As every  frustrated rosarian knows, one simply cannot grow everything everywhere. Ms  Lawrence informed her readers by sharing the thoughts, concerns, and  experinces of her correspondants about some plant, say ground phlox, and  well as her own thoughts and experiences concerning the same plant.<br />Because Ms Lawrence was a botanist, she preferred the Latin names of  plants, and always used them in her writing. She included the local  coloquial names too -- and on hearing them you understand why the Latin  terminology is indespensible. I have find her approach extremely helpful  because plants often have dozens of local names, but the Latin  identification allows me to know exactly what she's discussing and find it  in Hortus. Also, the editors have added footnotes where necessary to update  the Latin terminology.<br />Ms Lawrence loved 'Rock Gardening' and I found the  sections addressing this topic most illiminating. She contrasts the  mountainous origins of plants growing on rocks, with the efforts of  gardeners in the flatlands to build &quot;mountain-like&quot; gardens. You  can build a rock garden anywhere, you just have to think about what you're  doing, use flora that will survive in your microcosm, and select plants  that will not overtake a bed or dwarf other plants with outsized  proportions.<br />On a business trip a few years ago, I visited the Denver  Botanical Garden--with the goal of viewing the Alpine Rock Gardens. It was  April, the sky was blue and the weather unseasonably warm (70 degrees).  Lilacs were in bloom along with hundreds of bulbs, but the thing I will  remember the longest are the wonderful Alpine rock gardens. I spent the  whole day wandering from plot to plot, and don't recall ever having felt  any happier. There are little bits of heaven on earth and the Denver  Botanical Garden is one of them.ely helpful  because plants often have dozens of local names, but the Latin  identification allows me to know exactly what she's discussing and find it  in Hortus.

And--not in just one place but over and over from the beginning to the last page. If this book doesn't win the Booker and every other award in  England...well let's give it a Pulitzer in the U.S.  And Oprah..I sure hope  you can endorse books written by citizens of the U.K.<br />It's too easy to  call this book zany. And, having read Simone de Beauvoir's writing, I can  understand how a 24-year old can be brilliant. &quot;White Teeth&quot; is a  masterpiece: complex, confounding, existential, and hilarious. Smith takes  a wry look at social relationships, including friendships, marriages,  parent-child connections, young lovers, gangs, cultural groups, religious  cults, intellectual circles, and guys who hang aroung greasy pubs. She  meticulously attends to what she observes and deftly records all the  nuances of character and behaviour. She is the Jane Austin of the Age of  Aquarius. She is the Coraghassan Boyle of Britain.<br />Smith accurately  reflects and humorously depicts the times we live in--a world where  individuals are struggling to define the meaning of existence via  psychiatry, religion, science, and personal relationships. A world where  cultural imperatives are not nearly as critical as &quot;who made me&quot;  and &quot;why do I exist.&quot;<br />This is a story of generations and  generatonal warfare. Of children who don't understand parents, of parents  who don't understand children or each other. Of children who think someone  else's parents are superior. Of grandparents who are Jehovah's witnesses  and ride motorbikes with former boyfriends who have &quot;seen the  light&quot; and great-grandparents who start mutinies but fail to pull the  trigger.<br />Every thread of the narrative is woven into a seamless  tale--there are NO loose ends. &quot;What goes around comes around&quot;  until the end of time. What is set in motion affects the life that set it  in motion. Is this fate? Is it the result of rational thought and action?  Is it the will of Allah, God, Jehovah?<br />How is the Nazi Herr Ferret, with  the bleeding tear ducts, Archie Jones and Samid Iqbal encounter in WWII  Romania tied to the creation of the SuperMouse by Marcus Chalfen (alias  Chalpinski a Jewish emigree from Poland via Germany).<br />How do the genes  of Englishman Captain Charlie Durham (&quot;damn fool bwoy&quot;) who  sacrificed a thousand Jamaican people for a woman he never knew come to  reside in Hortense, Clara and Irie of Jamaican descent. How does Clara  loose her teeth, loose Ryan, and manage to fall for another Englishman of  dubious intelligence?<br />How does the identical DNA in Magid and Millat  Iqbal coincide with such different personalities. Samid sends Magid to  Bangladesh to be raised in the Muslim culture--but he becomes more English  than the English and, in spite of his father's protests, returns to England  become patent lawyer involved in Marcus Chalfin's SuperMouse  project.<br />Millat, the twin who Samid cannot afford to send to Bangladesh  grows up in North London, smokes and sells Marijuana, has a zillion  girfriends and loves gangster movies. His heroes are de Niro, Liotta,  Pacino. He attempts to renounce these devilish pursuits when he encounters  the green-bowtie wearing militant Muslin gang known as KEVIN (yes,they know  they have an acronym problem).  KEVIN seeks the destruction of all ungodly  behavior, including Marcus Chalfin's ungodly experiments with mice.  Millat's affinity with gangsters seems convenient (&quot;As far back as I  can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster&quot; becomes &quot;As far  back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a Muslim.&quot;)<br />Marcus's  son Joshua grows a Jewfro and joins FATE, an animal rights group living in  a Victorian mansion trashed by Australian illegal immigrants. FATE is the  violent arm of Greenpeace that targets the inhumane treatment of  animals--including mice raised for nefarious purposes.<br />Suddenly, it's  New Year's Eve and all the characters are headed for Trafalgar Square. FATE  travels in it's liberation bus borrowed from a social worker. KEVIN and Sam  and Archie and their wives, and Meena the lesbian &quot;niece of  shame&quot; travel via subway.

I believe this book was nominated for an award or two, and it is well written and easy to read in a sitting or two.  The story line is familiar--life in a small town in a rural setting. Most of us live in urban  areas these days, but many have parents or grandparents who lived in small  towns, or can imagine life in a place where everyone knows everyone.<br />Any  number of books including murder mysteries are set in towns or villages.  This is a refreshing book because the characters are real but not  psychotic. They all have too much going on in their own lives to meddle  with others or murder a neighbor. Haruf depicts the day to day struggle--to  get out of bed, to get to work, to do your job, to find love. You come to  care about his characters, particularly Maggie Jones the school teacher who  brings people together.  It is Maggie who understands the needs of the  McPheron brothers, Vitoria Roubideaux, and Tom Guthrie. She isn't a do-good  Mrs. Fix-it either, just a kindly person who cares enough to make a useful  suggestion, lend a helping hand, or offer a word of encouragement. In the  end, all the characters whose lives have been touched by Maggie's simple  grace have formed a better life for themselves.<br />My only criticism of  the book is that it lacks a sense of connectedness with the setting. The  characterization is strong and the plot is straightforward, but I did not  feel &quot;present&quot; in the story.  I had the sense I was moving  underwater and only vaguely comprehended my surroundings.  It's the feeling  I've had when coming out from under general anesthesia. I could not latch  onto the story the same way I did with Jane Smiley's &quot;Thousand  Acres&quot; where I could almost see and touch and smell the land.<br />I sent  my 85-year old Aunt (retired school teacher and high school counselor who  lives in rural Wisconsin) the audio version of the book and she thoroughly  enjoyed it. She said it sounded &quot;real&quot; to her and Victoria  reminded her of any number of girls she had known while she was teaching.ia  reminded her of any number of girls she had known while she was teaching.	2000-06-09

One has to have some prior knowledge to follow his 'plot' which seems to be a send-up  of deconstructionism.<br />Olga Kominski, a supposedly brilliant feminist  writer joins the faculty of an unnamed university. She is of vague origin,  perhaps Eastern European given her Polish last name. Her origin would not  be an issue but for her proclivity to speak with multiple accents.<br />Olga  has been hired as a member of the English faculty, and she is working on a  book in her spare time. A professor of English writing a book is not  unusual, but what is unusual is that as Olga writes, the characters in  L'Heureux's book act in accordance with the characters in Olga's text. Is  Olga merely recording the events she witnesses in the lives around her?  Is  she manipulating people so that they behave in ways she desires? Or, is she  writing a script and through mysterious powers gaining the willing  participation of the characters?<br />One experiences a sensation akin to  that felt when viewing the famous Escher print where the hand is drawing  the hand is drawing the hand.  Surely, the author is spoofing the  reader.<br />Most of the characters in Olga's book and L'Heureux's book are  faculty peers or their spouses.  All have secrets. All have problems.  Unfortunately, the characters in both books are one-dimensional  caricatures. I found it difficult to care about them. Unlike the characters  in Jane Smiley's &quot;Moo&quot; some of whom still live in my mind,  L'Heureux's characters are totally forgetable.  The possible exception is  Daryl the taxicab driver who seems to be &quot;real.&quot;	2000-06-07

Her book is useful in those areas where the topics differ from the standard  Blue Book or Michelin Guide, but in areas where annual updates are provided  the guides are better. Everything including the telephone numbers changes  so rapidly these days one can hardly keep up. For example, Ms. Toth  recommends using Consumer Reports, but I have found working with AAA more  effective. This doesn't mean I leave everything to them, I don't, I just  rely on them for information about flights, car rentals, and other areas of  their expertise.<br />Ms. Toth likes gardens, and so do I so I enjoy her  feedback about her experieces. There are many gardens in England, and some  of them are more like national forests in the U.S.  I like the more  intimate gardens, although I make it to Kew every time I travel.  Kew  Garens has an online site now, so you can check it out. Talk about big  changes...<br />Although we've mastered the automobile on British roads, given  current traffic problems in England, we always think twice about driving.  The last two times I traveled to England I stuck to trains most of the  time. We drove from London to Maidstone in 1993 and it took three hours. We  were driving in the middle of the day, and there was no accident. You might  want to rent a car only when you need it, and don't pick it up near a large  urban area. It's easy enough to get one at the airports, or in middle sized  places. We tried that a few years ago and it worked well.<br />I found Ms.  Toth's Thumbprint Theory of Travel was the best feature of this book. She's  onto something.  No more trying to see England in a week for me.  The last  time I visited England I stayed at the same hotel for a week. I made day  trips by train and bus and was very relaxed. I think I learned much more  than I would have by tearing all over and hitting the &quot;high&quot;  spots--whatever those are.<br />We've also learned how to eat in in the  evenings. We eat at the fancy restaurants or pubs at midday, then buy  fruit, cheese, crackers, water, etc. and eat in at night. Besides, I'm too  busy on the laptop writing emails back home to share my day with everyone  to be bothered with eating out. Feels good to get my feet elevated too, and  they frown on that in restaurants, though I've been known to do it. My  husband will massage my feet under the table, but the food servers look  askance at his behaviour. Ah, we Americans just can't behave in public.&quot;high&quot;  spots--whatever those are.<br />We've also learned how to eat in in the  evenings.

Park Honan (professor of English and American Literature at the Universiy of Leeds in England) wrote &quot;Jane Austen: Her Life&quot; in the late  1980's. At the time he wrote his book, he had access to much new material  including a treasure trove of letters written by various folks who knew Ms.  Austen. Mr. Honan has included an impressive bibliography in his book which  should keep one reading for years to come.<br />Honan says Ms. Austen  understood the current affairs of her time and he provides ample  documentation to substantiate this assertion. He also suggests her  knowledge of current events is reflected in her writing, albeit thinly  disguised.<br />Although Austen lead a somewhat sheltered life as the  daughter of an English vicar, she lived in exciting times.  Napolean was at  his height, the Revolution in France and subsequent 'Reign of Terror' kept  English on pins and needles, thirteen of England's 23 American colonies had  revolted and created a new nation that had sided with the French, and the  aristocracy was in turmoil over scandels surrounding the monarcy.<br />Austen  was kept abreast of these activities in a variety of ways including letters  from her naval  brother Frank. Historians have uncovered over 500 letters  Frank wrote to family members, and he kept meticulous journals of his time  in the navy. Although he probably did not tell Jane everything, he did  share many newsworthy events such as the difficulties on his ship the  'London' when six men were hanged and some others &quot;lashed for  insolence, mutiny and an 'unnatural crime of Sodomy.&quot;  Honan says  Austen refers to this incident in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; when she has  the character Mary Crawford who is living next door with her adulterous  admiral uncle say, &quot;Of Rears and Vices, I saw enough.&quot;<br />Honan  says Austen was influenced by the writings of Mme. de Sevigne, whom Ms.  Austen's father considered too much of a feminist. Jane Austen was very  concerned about the plight of women and considered adultry and divorce a  scourge on women. She was aware of the Regent Prince's attempt to put aside  his wife Queen Charlotte on &quot;trumped up&quot; charges of adultry. She  sympathized with the Queen, unaware that the Queen was a fan of her books.<br />Influenced by works such as the third Earl of Shaftesbury's  &quot;Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times&quot; she enjoined  her readers to have the 'sense' &quot;to control one's emotions through  observation, reason and moral understanding&quot; and the sensibility  to  have an &quot;accurate perception of other people and their  feelings.&quot;<br />There are plenty of examples throughout Honan's book of  the effect of external events on Ms. Austen's writing and thinking, not  only her books, but in the letters that did survive and journals kept by  Ms. Austen and others.<br />This is an informative an excellent book for  anyone who wants to know more about Ms. Austen's life and works.rned about the plight of women and considered adultry and divorce a  scourge on women.

Allen Lacy says the &quot;gardener's eye&quot; is comparable to a &quot;gift of what Christians call grace--a gift that comes from outside, that is apart from one's own intentions.&quot; The gardener's eye is an  artistic vision, an aesthetic experience, a recognition of  beauty.<br />Sometimes art is created by humans, mostly it comes from nature.  He begins his book in winter, writing at the desk in his study.  Looking  out the window he notes &quot;even in winter there is always something to  see.&quot;  Birds are about and the paulawnia bark is grey and stained  green from the algae growing on the trunk. He can see the color and texture  of the blackish bark on the White pine.<br />In the next chapter, he remarks  on the beauty of thistles, the bane of farmers and the emblem of Scotland.  He says the Scottish thistle is impossible to ignore with it's outsized  stem and leaves and it's ability to inflict pain. &quot;My love affair with  thistles has been going on for years. So have the visits from stangers who  stop in the driveway and ask fo a closer look at these giants of the summer  garden.&quot;<br />A few miles away from Lacy's home is a garden filled with  tall bearded Irises (German Irises). Named for the Greek Goddess of the  rainbow, the irises are many hued. The hybridzers have done their job and  created a palette of every color. At the appropriate moment every year he  drives to the neighbor's garden to see the Irises in bloom.<br />Page after  page Lacy moves futher afield, past a cotton patch near Durham NC, to  Middleton Place in South Carolina where the garden established in 1741 has  become a point of horticultural pilgrimage for Americans and visitors  overseas alike. Vita Sackville-West, she who built Sissinghurst, once  traveled to this spot. &quot;Stand I indeed in England? Do I dream?&quot;  she is reputed to have said.<br />Lacy notes the Arends nursery in Germany,  now run by his granddaughter Ursula Maubach is the source of the wonderful  Astilbes found in many American gardens. There's A. taquettii 'Superba'  with it's &quot;tight, dense spikes&quot; as well as pink 'Cattleya' and  plumey 'Ostrich Feather.'

Ms Lawrence gardened in Charlotte and Raleigh  North Carolina, and was a trained horticulturist. Lacy himself has edited  some of her material.

When I read Toth's book, I had not yet read M.F.K. Fisher. Fisher's endorsement of this book is on the cover, and that makes sense to me as there are similarities in their writing styles. Toth has written many  articles on her travels in England. She has compiled this information into  a number of books.  Some the books concentrate on a particular location in  Englan -- as she puts it one that fits under your thumbnail when you hold  it to a map.  This book is a distillation of her various trips to England  between 1963 and the early 1990's.<br />Ms. Toth writes autobiographically,  sharing her ups and downs. I've learned to listen to what she suggests.  Probably the most important chapter in the book, &quot;1984-1992, On the  Sunny (If Wrong) Side of the Street--travels with James&quot; tells about  life in the fast lane, or wrong lane from the American perspective. A  couple of decades ago my husband and I made our first trip to England  together (I hadn't read Toth then) and we rented a car. I will never forget  our arrival in Bath where my husband jumped out of the car and handed the  attendent a 10 pound note to drive it 20 feet and park it. This followed a  day of his learning how to negotiate roundabouts and driving on the wrong  side of the road while I navigated, the hedgerow slapped the mirror an my  side, and I screamed in fear. It was 10 years before we could laugh about  our first driving trip in England and we took trains, cabs and buses for a  long while, but finally mastered the road only to discover the enormous  increase in traffic has made much of southern Engand like LA at rush hour.  On my last trip, I went back to subways and trains. If you are a very  nervous person or this is your first trip don't rent a car.<br />I enjoyed  all the chapters, but I liked the &quot;Among the Alchemillas&quot; best  because I've learned Ms Toth knows where to go to find the best gardens.  It's not enough to buy a book that lists all 10,000 gardens. I want someone  to tell me what they found. As Ms. Toth points out, the English have a  different idea of what constitutes a garden.

Toth returned to her forte in this book, describing her own adventures which she does best. I enjoy her newsy writing, what you would expect from a friend or close relative.  Although I've made many trips to England, she  always manages to find something I haven't visited, and sure enough she did  it in this book too. I found her &quot;Meandering Through Museums&quot;  most helpful.  It's too easy to stay with the same old favorites, and I  always hit a few of them, but London is diverse and it pays to get off the  beaten track. On my last trip a year and a half ago, I went out of my way  to try some of her recommendations. I won't list them all here of course,  but there seems to be a museum for anything and everthing in Great Britain.  Like thimbles? There's a museum in Biggar Scotland filled with them.  &quot;On walls lined with row after row of very narrow shelves, only inches  apart.&quot; Of course, if you're into almost anything, the Vicoria and  Albert Museum in London will fill the bill. After several trips, I still  haven't exhausted the place.<br />Toth not only finds odd little museums as  well as old favorites, she finds odd little places. How about Groombridge  Place near Tunbridge Wells. I stayed in Tunbridge once and I don't think I  even heard of it. How does she do it?	2000-06-06

I read &quot;Provence&quot; by Lawrence Durrell before I stumbled onto more recent works by other authors. For my money, this is the book for arm chair and real travelers, and history buffs who are interested in Provence.  Durrell lived there for over 30 years and his writing depicts a place he  found filled with the spirits of past civilizations. His chapters cover a  number of them, including the Greeks, Romans, and Medieval times.<br />The  chapter I have remembered the longest is &quot;The Story of Marius.&quot;  Gaius Marius was one of the greatest generals Rome ever produced. He was  married to Julius Caesar's aunt, and was responsible for &quot;saving&quot;  Rome from northern invaders driven from their own homes by flood and  famine. Marius' successor Sulla, tried to destroy his reputation by erasing  many of his monuments, but Julius Caesar restored them when he came to  power. Durrell takes you to visit a site in ancient Les Baux marked for an  unknown event in Marius' life. Durrell says, &quot;There is much else we  might like to know about Marius which would bring him more fully to life in  these pages, but history is never eloquent enough about her  children..&quot; (Coleen McCullogh writes great fiction about these times,  see &quot;The First Man in Rome.&quot;)<br />In spite of it's Roman past,  Durrell finds Provence more Medieval than anything else. He says  &quot;Provence is a strange place..with withdrawn Protestant communities  who live out a life of secret repudiation.&quot;  He suggests a certain  melancholy, a &quot;deep introspective undertow&quot; permeates the land.<br />Narbonne, Avignon, and Nimes are rich with Roman relics.  Here one can  see the Roman tombs with &quot;funery stone of freedman's caps.&quot; When  the noble Roman died, he freed some of his slaves to make himself eligible  for the Afterworld. The cap symbolizing this freedom has come down through  history in many forms including Robin Hood's peaked hat and in the various  artistic renderings of Miss Liberty's head gear.

I had previously read many of the books, articles, news columns etc. excerpted in Jane Garmey's book &quot;The Writer in the Garden&quot; but I  read them again because most are very well written. Now, I'll hand the book  over to my daughter who has recently taken an interest in gardening. She's  approaching 40 and one of the writers in this book suggests 40 is the  fateful age when gardening takes on new meaning.<br />If you haven't read  many &quot;garden&quot; books and are looking for a place to begin, try  this book. There are about 10,000 garden books on the market, many of them  not worth a dime, but Garmey has included excerpts from some of the  masters: Henry Mitchell, Anne Raver, Beverly Nichols, Vita Sackville West,  Elizabeth Lawrence, Allen Lacy, Katherine White, Joe Eck and Wayne  Winterrowd. All these excellent gardeners have years of hands-on  experience, as well as a talent for distilling years of experience into  some fine &quot;yarns.&quot;<br />I discovered a new writer whose book of  poetry I intend to read--W. S. Merwin. He describes his gardening efforts  in Hawaii.  I lived there once, and recall taking a dead stick and using it  as a stake to prop a plant. The &quot;dead&quot; stick came to life. An  idiot could garden in Hawaii. However, Mr. Merwin is trying to do something  different.  He's planting native flora in his hillside garden where fools  once tried to grow sugar. His writing is so lucid and beautiful I felt  transported to a garden I left over 30 years ago. His essay, &quot;The  Shape of Water&quot; is worth the price of the book.<br />Ms Garmey has  included other writers I don't think of as garden writers. Mary Francis  Kennedy Fisher, whose autobiographical writings focus more on food than  where it came from writes about roses in a childhood garden. Since she grew  up in Whittier California, you can bet those roses were superb.<br />Several  of the writers were boring or fretful and I am put off by both traits. I  don't care for articles that give me so much detail I fall asleep, but not  enough detail to help me. I also am tired of writers who complain. Anyone  who gardens knows it's hard work. On the other hand, sometimes the  complaints were hilarious. Eleanor Perenyi does seem to have had a run of  bad luck with her gardeners.<br />Before you invest in other gardening books,  you might review the material in this little book. You will discover first  hand why not all &quot;garden&quot; writers are created equal--or even if  they are, may not appeal to you. This is a book of essays with little  immediate practical information for beginners.

The &quot;Age of Rembrandt and Vermeer&quot; covers Dutch artists who worked in approximately the first two thirds of the 17th Century in the Netherlands. Although much of the text focuses on Rembrandt and Vermeer,  the book briefly covers the Mannerists, Frans Hals, early landscape and  genre painters, Rusidael, and Hobbema.<br />The book begins with works of  Hendrick Avercamp (&quot;A Winter Scene with Skater near a Castle&quot;  painted about 1609) and ends with Samuel Van Hoogstraten (&quot;Les  Pantoufles&quot;). Pages 1-63 provide an overview and pages 241-275 provide  short biographies, bibliographies and an index.<br />Pages 65-240 are printed  on glossy paper and contain photographs of a representative sample of the  Dutch artists working during the period. The paintings are mostly in black  and white, however, colored photos are shown thoroughout the text.  Rembrandt's &quot;Jan Six&quot; and &quot;The Polish Rider&quot; are in  color, and reasonably captured. On the other hand, one of my favorites,  &quot;A View of Deventer&quot; by Salomon Van Ruysdael from the National  Gallery in London is shown in black and white. Sometimes a painting is in  black and white, while a detail is shown in color. It's difficult to see  much of the brushwork, but one can obtain an idea of the content,  composition, lighting and shading, and other elements from these prints.  Nothing beats the original, but the photographs do a reasonable job.<br />I  refer to this book from time to time, and on occasion have used it  extensively. For example,  while reading Schama's &quot;Rembrandt's  Eyes&quot; I used the book to gain additional information about some of the  paintings he covers. For example, Schama covers Rembrandt's &quot;The Feast  of Belshazzar: The Writing in the Wall&quot; for several pages. The photo  in Schama's book is adequate for following his discussion, but Nash's book  shows larger and more detailed photos (in color), as well as an enlarged  detail of the two women at the king's right hand.two women at the king's right hand.	2000-06-04

I found &quot;Within Tuscany&quot; in the travel section of a bookstore and bought it because it was about Italy. I actually ended up enjoying it mostly because of the quirky life of the author-artist -- or perhaps more  correctly, the reflections of an artist about his past several years of  living in a particularly attractive place.<br />He apparently has or had  female companions along the way. There's a wife, maybe, and some daughters  (pictured in the book in a mid-seventies photo wearing clothes their mother  made), and a friend Vittoria with whom he spends a great deal of time. He  describes his life style as &quot;alternative&quot; which I take to mean  not exactly traditional Italian.<br />Mathew Spender is English, and like  fellow travlers in Tuscany, he relates amusing cultural incidents. He  describes several notable friendships with individuals from various classes  and backgrounds, one of whom dies two-thirds through the book. I believe he  is a sculpter. His descriptions are physical and three dimensional, but he  also plays his clarinet in the village band. Throughout the book he recalls  his visits to a few notable places in Tuscany and shares his experiences at  those places, but you would have to know the places to follow his writing  completely.<br />Spender's writing reminds me a bit of John Mortimer's in  &quot;Summer Lease&quot; as it's both sweet and sad. His observations about  folks in various stages of life's sorrows and joys are touching. Spender  also has an artists comprehension,  absorbing and conveying what is going  on around him.	2000-06-04

John Mortimer is an extremely literate and witty writer of books, screen plays, and other material, including the Rumpole series. This book is a bit different from his other books, including Dunster. &quot;Summer Lease&quot;  is his best book as far as I am concerned. The protagonist is a woman named  Molly Pargeter. One might not beleive the creater of Mrs. Rumpole (She Who  Must Be Obeyed)could manage an authentic female protagonist, but he does.<br />Molly is an English woman married to a successful English man,  successful enough to afford a villa in Tuscany for the summer--a summer's  lease. Molly's semi-absent husband may or may not be faithful but they  share an &quot;unfriendly matrimonial bed.&quot; Her mostly grown children  have their own lives, and her father living down the road has his own  interests which don't include Molly.<br />Left with time on her hands, Molly  begins to wonder about her absent landlord. What is he up to? By doing a  bit of 'detecting' she discovers the answer. At the end of the summer's  lease, she has also acquired personal insight into her own life and issues.  I especially enjoyed the varous scenarios Mortimer depicts as Molly moves  around Tuscany, tracking the landlord, or attending to her own business --  viewing paintings in museums, attending the horse races, walking along the  dusty roads, etc. This book is a good &quot;read.&quot;	2000-06-04

As a student of history with a keen interest in England, the Netherlands and France, I found reference after reference to the Habsburgs. Philip II kept popping up. First he would be invading the Netherlands, then he would  be married to Queen Mary, then he would be pursuing Elizabeth I, then he  launched an armada.<br />Phillip II and the Tudor girls, Mary and Elizabeth  were descendents of John of Gaunt, son of Edward III, brother of the Black  Prince, and grandfather of Henry V, who died in 1399 at the beginning of  the Wars of the Roses. John's progeny descended through 1) Blanche of  Lancaster (Henry V), 2) Isabel a Portuguese princess (Charles V, Phillip  II, Mary Tudor) and 3) his mistress and third wife Katherine Swynford  (Tudors).<br />The book begins with Charles V, known for sacking Rome in  1525. The German Habsburgs have intermarried with the royal family of  Spain. Charles the V is the first Habsburg and Holy Roman Emperor to be  raised in Spain, even though he was born in Ghent in the Netherlands--the  birthplace of John of Gaunt his ancestor. From this time forward, Spain has  a claim on the Netherlands.<br />Under Philip II, Charle V's son, some of the  provinces of the Netherlands rebel, and gain a freedom of sorts though they  are threatened by the Spanish occupiers of Catholic Flanders. In the  background Philip marries four times, and Mary Tudor is one of his wives.<br />The book is informative, covers a dynamic period in the history of  Europe and fills in many blanks for those interested in the history of the  Netherlands and England. To it's credit, the Inquisition is treated without  sensationalism. It is a synopsis covering an almost hundred year period.  Iwould have liked less about the Spanish colonies overseas and a better  index, but the bibliography is comprehensive.	2000-06-02

Several prominent historians recommended this book so I decided to read it.  I found it extrememly well informed, heavily documented and clearly written. The book covers a number of years in a period once called the  &quot;Dark Ages&quot; and now referred to as the Middle Ages. I read this  book to further my knowledge of the Middle Ages. Also, although I am  interested in the history of England, the Netherlands, France and Italy,  and not a devotee of German History per se, my interests led me to  Frederick II, the Emperor of Germany, because he once ruled parts of Italy  including Sicily.<br />Abulafia, had access to the Vatican archives to  research his book, and thus has been able to recast these years of the  Middle Ages, as well as the character of Frederick II.  Some call this kind  of writing revisionist history, if so, it is revisionism at it's best as  Abulafia does not appear to have an &quot;axe to grind&quot; or a  preconceived notion of what transpired. He reports the facts as he finds  them. For example, many have long admired Frederick as a secular leader who  &quot;stood up to the Pope.&quot; However, it appears Frederick was a bit  more fickle in his relationships with Popes than had been thought. He may  have been able to get around Pope Honorius, he met his match in Gregory.<br />Frederick had promised to go on a crusade to expiate his sins, but he  failed to do so.  Gregory told Frederick &quot;Do not put yourself in a  position where I have to take action against you; go on a crusade as  promised or else.&quot;  Frederick failed to keep his word and Gregory  excommunicated him. Abulafia's depiction of the struggle between these two  powerful individuals reads like a novel.<br />An interesting note--the basis  of Shakespeare's dueling families in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is  revealed--they were antagonists because one sided with the Pope and his  faction, and the other with Frederick.  The Waibles and the Welfs of  Germany became the Guelfs and Ghibllines of Italy--and precursors to the  Protestant and Catholic struggles centuries later.s and Ghibllines of Italy--and precursors to the  Protestant and Catholic struggles centuries later.	2000-06-02

Miranda Vickers does an excellent job of distilling the available primary and secondary historical and geographical material on the former Yugoslavia into a lucid and compelling book. Unlike some writers, she footnotes her  sources so the reader can form his or her own opinions based on further  reading.<br />Ms. Vickers does not provide in-depth detail because the  objective of this book is to provide a synopsis. Her work supports the  contention that rivalries of the various ethnic groups have waxed and waned  but long been a source of bloodshed. The worst scenarios in this book  involved the spilling of blood as the Serbs attempted to overthrow assorted  conquerers including the Ottoman Turks, Austrians, Hungarians, Nazis and  others.<br />Vickers says the Albanian question is extremely thorny and very  old.  On the one hand, the Albaninans in Kosovo seemed not to have much  interest in being part of Albania proper (probably owing to the radically  different and worse standards of living in Albania).  On the other hand the  Albanians seem not to want to be part of Serbia either, though many of them  moved to Serbia.<br />In 1918, during the Great War, when the Albanians had  sided with the enemy &quot;Hun&quot; and the Serbs were allies, the U.S.  recognized the anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo (a battle fought and  lost to the Ottoman Turk invaders hundreds of years before). This  recognition followed the deaths of 100,000 Serbs as they retreated before  the Austro-Hungarian army through Kosovo. &quot;The majority lay unburied,  covered by either snow or mud, until only their bones were found the  following spring.&quot;<br />By the late 1990's many U.S. leaders--for  whatever reason--failed to fully appreciate the ancient hatreds. One has to  wonder how history might have been different if the diplomatic approach  used in the Middle East with the Palestinians and Jews had been attempted  in the Balkans.	2000-06-02

I wanted to read it because I heard a review of the book on National Public Radio, and thought it would give me a little insight into writers and writing.  Some of the essays are better  than others. I still don't know what Margaret Fuller did, though apparently  many who knew her were impressed.<br />Ms. Hardwick divides the American  writers she reviews into several categories. Mrs. Wharton is in her  &quot;Old New York&quot; section. She reviews her books, and the reviews  written at the time her books were published. I loved the &quot;Age of  Innocence&quot; but it was all down hill from there as far as I am  concerned, though Ms. Hardwick defends a few of her other pieces.<br />Ms.  Hardwick coves, Cheever, Didion and Roth in &quot;Fictions of  America.&quot; Since I was never jaded enough to fully appreciate these  writers, I was happy to read Ms. Hardwick's views and discover the reasons  why I found them off-putting. It's not that they couldn't write, but that I  just didn't like what they wrote. On the other hand, I was jaded enough to  read a couple of books by John Updike (not Rabbit) and Richard Ford  (Independece Day) and though I find them both overgrown adolescents thought  her coverage of them was fair.  They write well, I'm just tired of men in  mid-life crises.<br />She ends with Mary McCarthy and Nadine Gordimer. Gosh  the 20th Century was sure awful.	2000-05-29

I like to read something calming just before bed, and Ms. Osler's book struck me as suitable for that purpose. Like a bedtime story, it put me to sleep night after night for several weeks. Her observations left me feeling  &quot;God's in his heaven, All's right with the world.&quot;<br />Ms. Osler  lives and gardens in England, so her observations are not particularly  applicable for most gardeners in the states.  However, her book is not  meant to be a &quot;how to&quot; book. It is filled with general  observations gardeners everywhere can relate to.<br />Ms. Osler wrote  &quot;A Gentle Plea for Chaos&quot;  about a garden she built with her  husband, who apparently died before that book was published as she  dedicated it to him.  &quot;Breath&quot; is about her life after his death.  In this book, Ms. Osler describes how she settled into a new house and  garden and a new life. Although it's ostensibly a gardening book, it could  be viewed as a book about getting on with your life when you're on your  own.<br />Ms Osler's books are autobiographical, gentle, and kindly.	2000-05-29

I've read some of Ms Kincaid's short stories and enjoyed them, and I love gardening books, especially essays. I bought this book thinking &quot;How can I miss!&quot;  Unfortunately, in spite of the pretty cover, I did not  find the book particularly interesting or appealing. Ms. Kincaid simply  does not know enough about the subject to write about it. She is no Allen  Lacy, Henry Mitchell, Adrianne Higgins, Diane Raver, or Elizabeth Lawrence.  Don't fall into the trap I did of assuming because she can write well, she  can write about gardening. If I had seen the book in the book store, I  would have known it was &quot;fluff&quot; by flipping through a few  pages.<br />I've read other books that were equally useless and dull, and I  suppose I held Ms. Kincaid to a higher standard since she writes so well.  My advice to her would be to follow the rule of good writing, stick to what  you know.	2000-05-29

Allen Lacy has been writing about gardening for a number of years in books, newspaper columns and letters to friends. I've purchased mostly paperback copies, but bought this one in hardcover because I kept the  others and wish now I had bought hardcover versions. I reread them from  time to time, and lend them to really good friends who will return them.  Lacy gardens in New Jersey in Zone 7 so I find his writing helpful since I  live in the same climate. He was a philosophy professor for a number of  years, and his writing is reflective. This book is filled with practical  wisdom.  Think of your old uncle Horace who can get anything to grow  sharing some of advice. Lacy's books fall some where between an essay on  &quot;How gardening changed my life&quot; and &quot;Why your Bee Balm got  Mildew.&quot;<br />&quot;In a Green Shade&quot; is a collection of  articles covering the seasons of the year. In spring he writes about bulbs  and other familiar plants, including Fritillaries which are not so well  known or grown because some find them frustrating. Lacy implies there is  hope for those who fancy these lovely flowers, though I refuse to waste any  more money on 'Imperialis.' He says if one can figure out how to treat them  properly, the fritillery are faithful flowers that return year after year.  I love Meleagris (Snake's Head lily, and have had some luck here).  Lacy  digresses on Thomas Jefferson's love of the Imperialis and it's origins in  Turkey.<br />In other sections, he covers lillies, roses, Bee Balm, tobacco  plants, gourds, dahlias, begonias, mums, trees (Hazel)and other plants he  has grown in his New Jersey garden. He discusses their nature as well as  nurture, and their history, geography and interesting anecdotes.  I  particularly found his bits on creating a garden on a deck interesting. His  pots, and trellises and other deck paraphanalia must be beautiful, and I  wish a photo or two had been included. I have mirrored his approach to  gardening--completely fill the yard with plants, shrubs and trees, and  removed the grass--so if you like grass, don't look here.<br />If you've  read many gardening books, some of the anecdotal material may seem  recycled. For example, seasoned readers know Nasturtiums are nose-twisters.  If you're starting out, the book will seem fresh, and funny in places. If  you need lots of basic &quot;how-to&quot; information, the book will prove  less useful.  There are no photos of how to prepare the soil or long  discussions of which tools to buy. From time to time, Mr.Lacy interjects  technical details, but this is not the strength of this book, although  there is a short list of extant nurseries in the back of the book.ng--completely fill the yard with plants, shrubs and trees, and  removed the grass--so if you like grass, don't look here.  <br />If you've  read many gardening books, some of the anecdotal material may seem  recycled.

I love his work, and I love the  paintings. <br />I bought this book thinking I would have a fine art book and  was disappointed. The book is apparently a replica of the original issued  many years ago. Unfortunately it appears to be an exact replica. Because of  this, the copies of the paintings are not well executed. The colors are  altered and a great deal of detail is lost. I like art books with  first-class photography. Even photo facsimiles fall short of the original  paintings. If you want the book for historical reasons it's fine. If you  want a really good art book with Chase's works, look elsewhere.	2000-05-29

I heard Ms. Martin speak at the National Wildlife Federation in Virginia just after she wrote this book.  At the time, I had no idea who Tasha Tudor was. I loved the talk and the slides Ms. Martin showed us during her  lecture. I bought the book because I wanted to remember these pictures for  a long, long time. They are beautiful.  <br />I showed the book to my  granddaughters Hannah and Amelia who immediately recognized Tasha Tudor,    since she illustrates children's books. The children and I enjoyed looking  at the photos of Tasha's daily life. We see her working in her garden at  different times of the year, feeding her goats, or walking with her Corgis  (The Corgis are everywhere--probably why I love the book. You can garden  and have dogs!)<br />In one photo, Tasha sits in the midst of a clump of pink  lillies sketching a pretty model dressed in an 19th century antebellum gown  of light grey silk. Another photo shows a closeup of a pretty blue bowl  filled with fresh red raspberries resting on green mint leaves. In another  photo, Tasha sits with a cup of tea in a delicate blue and white china cup  and saucer. <br />The book contains examples of Tasha's artwork  created for  the children's books. There's not a lot of text. Think of this the photo  album of your favorite Aunt. I own hundreds of art books and gardening  books, and this is one of the prettiest.	2000-05-29

Prose has appanently modeled her book on a book  by Stendal? and the film &quot;Blue Angel&quot; with Marlene Dietrich.  Dietrich play an actress named Lola. Lola sings &quot;Falling in Love  Again&quot; and then proceeds to destroy a professor who loves her. Since I  had not read the book? or seen the film, some of Prose's analogies probably  escaped me.<br />Swenson has alienated his daughter, is about to alienate his  wife of twenty years, and is obsessed with a young woman student about the  age of his own daughter.  The student, Angela Argo, is a pretentious,  manipulating, pierced, tatooed, and studded little &quot;actress.&quot;  According to Swenson, she's a great writer. Although Prose provides the  reader with excerpts from Angela's novel &quot;Eggs&quot; ..excuse me I  thought it was chicken ----. The girl would do better to travel to NYC and  try out for an off-off broadway revivial of &quot;Hair.&quot;<br />Prose's  &quot;Blue Angel&quot; does not have the Gothic element present in Joyce  Carol Oates &quot;American Appetites&quot;, nor does it handle the  deconstructionist angle as well as Jane Smiley's &quot;Moo&quot;. And  Allison Lurie's &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot; has better character  development.<br />Prose excells in amusing dialogue and unspoken  thoughts--the only reason I finished the book.

I read Dr. John Fine's two-volume &quot;History of the Balkans&quot; and then became engrossed with Colleen McCollough's fictional works on the Roman Republic/Empire. Recognizing my interests, my friend Russell the  reference librarian recommended J.J. Norwich.<br />The Roman Empire lasted a  good deal longer than most people think. It continued another 1,000 years  after the Emperor relocated from Rome to Constantinople. The western part  of Europe was &quot;at odds&quot; with this Eastern entity for a number of  centuries. (Christian theological differences are old). These ancient  &quot;attitudes&quot; have been reflected in the various stances nations  have taken recently toward Serbia (Orthodox Christian).<br />This book is a  distillation of the long, prosperous, and at times harrowing history of the  Orthodox Christians of the Roman Empire. These people did not call  themselves &quot;Byzantines&quot; or &quot;Byzantium&quot; but rather  thought of themselves as Romans, albeit very Greek Romans (spoke and wrote  in Greek).<br />The Roman Empire did not end until the 1400's when the  (Turks-Ottomans-Muslims) captured Constantinople. To their credit, the  Muslim invaders did not destroy all the books and historical documents left  behind --why we know something today of the entire history of the Roman  Empire.<br />Norwich writes extremely well, and although this history is not  easy to follow, if you're interested in the topic, this is a good place to  begin.	2000-05-26

Make no mistake, JJ Norwich wields a wicked pen. He is a first class writer and historian, and if anyone can make history readable for a general audience he can.<br />History is complex, however.  Nothing is ever as it  seems and following the thread as it weaves through the lives of the  English royalty from Edward II through Henry VII, is difficult at best and  confounding at worst. This is largely owing to five major factors--1) The  royal families are large, interrelated, and keep marrying their cousins  from abroad; 2) People change sides faster than you can swear an oath of  fealty; 3) Titles are gained, lost, and assumed with every death.  Just who  the heck is York anyway; 4) Most of the kings are lazy, crazy, or have  exceedingly ambitious wives; 5) Most of the nobles and clergy are crazy,  lazy, or have ambitious wives. In the end, the only folks you really care  about are the villeins and thank goodness, they eventually prevail. (Anyone  who thinks Africans were the only people ever enslaved needs to read a  little European history.)  I am sure I have been able to read and  understand most of this book because of my prior exposure to Allison  Weir--whom Norwich cites in his bibliography, particularly the &quot;Wars  of the Roses&quot; and &quot;The Children in the Tower.&quot;  I also read  an entertaining work of fiction entitled &quot;Katherine&quot; by Anya  Seton which covers the years 1340-1399. The book is about Katherine  Swynford, mistress and then wife of John of Gaunt, mother of all those  little Beaufords, and ancestor of Elizabeth I.<br />Norwich skillfully weaves  factual history with excerpts of Shakespeare's dialogue from the history  plays Edward III to Richard II.

Many reviewers have focused on the medical aspects of this biography, and while these digressins are interesting, I think it trivializes Karen Blixon's life and this book to say her medical history is the focal point.<br />The facet of this biography that most interested me, and is fully  explored by Donelson, was Baroness Blixon's genuine love of the African  natives. As a social scientist, with major interests in international  migration, the foreign born, and various ethnic and tribal groups in the  United States, I am fascinated by the depiction of the various tribes in  Karen Blixon's writing. Having read a number of books by and about  Africans, including ethnographies, I find the descriptions of the Kikuyu,  Masai, and Somali people extroardinary. Persons of African descent might  enjoy this book (inspite of the English colonizers)simply because Karen  Blixon was an ethnographer of sorts and Donelson distills a great deal of  information from her written observations.<br />Baroness Blixon acted as  employer, physician, friend, and mediator for the people who lived on her  farm.  She developed medicinal skills to deal with the ailments and  injuries likely to occur in daily living. While some of the European  practices were bizarre, it is also true that some of the native remedies  were equally bizarre.<br />Baroness Blixon was Scandanavian, and seen as  sympathetic to the Germans in WWI, a view that caused her enormous hardship  in this English colony.  As a result, to some extent she remained an  outsider to the English community, which probably facilitated her  acceptance of and by the native community.<br />The second major aspect of  this book that I actually found quite troubling was the wanton destruction  in the years the book covers.  Baroness Blixon took part in more than one  hunting safari (Finch-Hatton was a safari guide). Although she had more  regard for animals and peole than many of the other European settelers, I  still find the carnage of this era disgusting. It is haunting and sad to  imagine what East Africa must have been like before it was first  &quot;invaded.&quot;<br />Baron Blixon was grief stricken when she finally  left her farm in the Ngong hills, but she loved Denmark, and made a good  life for herself after she returned home.  She was nominated for the Nobel  prize for literature, and lost to Ernest Hemingway.  For my money, she  should have won on her correspondence alone. (She used the name Isak to  hide her sex from readers who preferred male writers in that day and age.)<br />Beryl Markham (Purvis) shows up in several places in the book, and  appears very different from her portrayal of herself in &quot;West With the  Night.&quot;  She is also a bit different from the character Susannah  Harker plays in the film &quot;Heat of the Sun&quot; loosely based on her  life as an avatrix.ge of this era disgusting.

I was talking about Africa one day, and one of my younger friends who had just completed college, recommended this book. I looked for the book because my friend is not given to reading, and the fact that she was  impressed told me it might be an interesting book.  I liked the book so  much, I bought a &quot;talking&quot; version for my older aunt who has lost  much of her vision and cannot read. She loved the book too.  From this  sample of three women, I can tell you this book will appeal to all ages.<br />Beryl Markham neglects many aspects of her colorful life, the story  briefly covers her child hood in Africa and then mostly focuses on her  wonderful flight, actually harder than Lindbergh's flight since she flew  East to West, Europe to North America, against the jet stream. The  description of the flight is thrilling up til the last when she crash  lands--in North America.<br />If you want to know more about Beryl and her  escapades, read &quot;Out of Isak Dinesen, Karn Blixon's Untold Story&quot;  by Linda Donelson. Beryl knew Blixon (17 years her senior, and a mentor at  some points) and Denis Finch Hatton. Also, the wonderful BBC film  &quot;Heat of the Sun&quot; contains a character played by Susannah Harker  (an avatrix) loosely based on Beryl Markham.	2000-05-23

I read &quot;Out on a Limb&quot; when I was much younger and was enthralled with Ms. Maclaine's frankness aoubt her past incarnations. In those days, I was frightened of my own shadow, and her openess made me feel  many things were possible. Since she is just a bit older than me and  experiencing the same need to reflect on the meaning of the live she has  been living, the &quot;The Camino&quot; -- her continuing autobiography --  is very relevant.<br />I have made a few pilgrimages to high holy places in  recent years, and have thought about the Camino for some time. I have been  to Spain--my son lives there-- and mostly travled on my own as he and I  never want to do the same things. When I first tried this, I was amazed  solo traveling did not kill me, and in fact I found my self improved,  better, stronger. Sometimes it's difficult for a woman to travel on her  own, but it can be done. Perhaps now I will work up the courage to try the  Camino.<br />The trip Ms. Macline made was long and difficult, and she did it  the right way, unburdening her self by letting go of all but the essential  material things and reflecting as she went along.  The book is about her  trip on the Camino, and her reflections along the way.<br />Ms. Maclaine  believes she has lived past lives. I don't know if I have any past lives,  but I think the possiblity exists. I have visited places in Europe where my  ancestors lived for thousands of years, where I had never been in this  life, but knew I had been there before. When I was a child, I recalled  events that could not have happened in my current life. I used to startle  my mother with these revelations. My mother and I both had incredible  &quot;ESP&quot; and I don't know what that is except a heightened  sensitiviry of some kind. When I went into labor with my first child at one  o'clock in the morning, my mother woke up from a sound sleep because she  heard me yelling 300 miles away. I wasn't on the phone (and I can't scream  that loudly! ).<br />In &quot;The Camino&quot; Ms. MacClaine says she slept  with a General in a past life. General George Patten also believed in  reincarnation, and that he had been a soldier in a battle fought over a  thousand years ago. But Maclaine says the reincarnation of her general took  the form of the Swedish Prime Minister whom she slept with in this life.<br />Fortunately, the influx of Asian Indians into the U.S. is beginning to  change the prejudice some of us have about 'past lives.'

We continue to read stories of the Jews who were rounded up and taken to the concentraion camps, and although most of us have thought &quot;How awful&quot; we have also probably thought &quot;I'm glad it wasn't  me.&quot;  But, what if you awakened one morning to find the Gestapo at the  front door and were told you were under arrest because you were a Jew. Your  first thought would be &quot;surely this is a case of mistaken  identity! &quot;<br />&quot;Embattled Selves&quot; by Kenneth Jacobson  documents the lives of 15 people who during World War II discovered they  were &quot;Jewish&quot; because the Nazis said so.  Some of them had Jewish  ancestors several generations removed they never knew existed. Some knew  they had Jewish ancestors, but they or their parents had converted to  Christianity.  Some were born into religious Jewish families, but no longer  practiced the religion.<br />Many of the more introspective of us spend our  lives thinking about who we are, how we became who we are, or how we can  become who we want to be. I have been working on my family geneology for  some time. Since my mother was Dutch, after I read this book by a man named  Jacobson who was Jewish, I took a closer look at the family tree. There are  some interesting characters in the branches--with last names like Jacobson.	2000-05-21

Mockingbirds are notorious for their propensity to mimic almost any sound. I believe Ms. Gordon uses the mockingbird as metaphor for the patient who becomes dependent on therapy and interacts with the therapist by saying and  doing imitative things she &quot;learns&quot; through therapy. Ms. Gordon  sees modern times as the age of therapy, when &quot;healing&quot; and  &quot;conseling&quot; are seen as ways to cure anything and everything. She  suggests classical therapy robs the patient of creative individuality, of  the ability to be imaginative<br />Emily Fox Gordon writes beautifully. Of her  early life with her mother she remembers... &quot;When she bathed my  brother and me, she floated candles anchored in halved walnut shells in the  bathtub. She turned off the lights, lit the candles, and stood smoking a  cigarette in a shadowy corner of the bathroom as we sat in the midst of a  small shining armada.&quot;<br />But things did not remain idyllic. As she  grew up, her parents abandoned her emotionally--Gordon's mother became  addicted to pills and alcohol, and her father involved in a high-level  career.  She became depressed, attempted suicide, and thus ensued many  years of classical therapy.<br />Fortunately, Ms. Gordon finally worked with  Dr. Leslie Faber, a psychiatrist who helped wean her from her dependence on  classical therapy via his &quot;talking&quot; method.  Later, Dr. B. helped  her end her dependance on Dr. Faber. She says of Dr. B., &quot;like the  Cheshire cat, he began to vaporize, leaving nothing behind but a glow of  unconditional positive regard....In resisting his impulse to lure me back  into the charted territory of psychoanalytic explanation, he granted me my  wish to be realeased into the wilds of narrative.&quot;<br />Ms. Gordon's  wonderful book is the result.	2000-05-21

This little book is a handy introduction for gardeners who are interested in adding bulbs to their flower beds.  The book has a heavy-duty plastic cover so you can take it outside and use it as a guide when you actually  plant the bulbs.<br />The sections are laid out by type, color, and size, and  filled with lots of photos that give you an idea of what the plant will  look like in flower. Each entry has symbols that indicate soil, light, and  water conditions for best growth, as well as space requirements. This is  handy because bulbs come from all over the world from dry hot places to  cold wet places.<br />This is a plant book, don't look for design ideas here.  Also, the number of entries is limited to what appear to be the most  popular bulbs--the ones you are likely to find in the nursery store and  general plant catalogues.  This book is not an encyclopedia.	2000-05-20

This is a beautiful book and more of a history book than a garden book. I found it in the history section of a local bookstore. &quot;The Tulip&quot; is filled with color reproductions of paintings and prints executed in the  Netherlands in the 16th-18th centuries, so one could argue it is an art  book.<br />Although the author tells the story of the introduction of the  tulip into the west, the real contribution of the book as far as I am  concerned is the author's discourse on the origins of the various kinds of  tulips.<br />Reading, &quot;The Tulip&quot; has relieved me of the feelings of  intimidation I have experienced as I browsed through the various  professional bulb catalogs from growers.  These catalogs have quite  reasonable prices, and many more bulb offerings than can be found in local  garden center stores, however, they never contain photos and provide only  sparse information about the growing requirements and behaviour of specific  bulbs. Knowing more about the geographic origins, history, and growing  preferences of various tulip types has made me bolder, and I am  experimenting with many new bulbs this year.<br />If you're new to gardening,  you may not find this book very useful. Try the Eyewitness Garden Handbook  &quot;Bulbs&quot; to get started growing bulbs, including tulips.	2000-05-20

Simon Winchester says the journalist writes the first draft of history.  This book is a fine bit of journalism as well as a quick read. The writing is personally reflective, and loosely associated with events in Kosovo in  1999.  It reads more like a travelog than a heavy duty investigative report  like &quot;The Haunted Land&quot; by Tina Rosenberg.<br />Wincester is  sensitive to history. He recommends &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot;  about the sad history of the Serbs by the Croat Ivo Andric who won the  Nobel Prize. He also  intersperses bits of history about many geographic  points he travels through between Vienna and that city that some still  think of as Constantinople.<br />Books by journalists who served as  correspondents during the military action contain less censored and  probably better written material than what appeared in original on-the-spot  news articles they might have written. The writer has had time to reflect  on what transpired, obtain additional historical and contextual  information, correct misinterpretations and generlly improve his or her  writing.<br />As part of my job and because of a personal interest I have in  the Balkans, I have been reading material about this part of the world for  some years, including the Andric book and books by the University of  Michigan historian John Fine. I read this book as part of my continuing  education and I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the Balkans.	2000-05-19

So often the tale of war is told from the standpoint of the brave soldiers or the cowardly soldiers or the stupid soldiers.  Here is a book about war told from the woman's point of view. Women are so vulnerable, and so often  the innocent victims along with their children of the cruelties of the  soldiers.<br />This was the first history I read about war from the  perspective of a woman.  I think the thing I fould most shocking about Ms.  Nesuale's story is that she survived the Nazi occupation relatively entact,  only to suffer dreadfully at the hands of the liberating Russian army.<br />The book has it's harrowing moments, but it is extremely uplifting.  Ms.  Nesaule survived the war and it's aftermath, moving to the U.S. as a  refugee immigrant.  She went on to become an educated woman, and today is  happily married and a college professor at the University of Wisconsin. Her  story is worth reading.	2000-05-19

John Fine Professor of History at the University of Michigan and probably the leading expert in the world on the Balkans, author of the two-volume and extremely detailed &quot;History of the Balkans&quot; and his former  student and expert in his own right, Robert Donia have written a nice  synopsis of the situation in Bosnia and Hercegovinia.<br />This is a useful  book, and a merciful read for those who don't want to wade through the  thousands of pages they have written on this subject.  I have  &quot;waded&quot; and actually completed one volume of the history by Fine  (cover-to-cover) and part of the second volume. Believe me it gets painful  in places.

Opting for a fair amount of character development and a solid plot, the author has created a thoroughly enjoyable book that I completed in one sitting.  Avid mystery readers will probably ID the killer about half way  through the book.<br />The supposed similarity of this book with those  written by Minette Walters must be owing to plot elements such as: three  suspects and a body found in water (the Breaker); or, a long dead body that  brings a formerly frustrated cop back to harass the main suspects (The Ice  House).  However, the depth of character development found in Walters'  better books is missing. And, the reader probably won't learn much from  this book, unlike those by Deborah Crombie (last two), Minette Walters, or  P.D. James -- or even Elizabeth George for that matter.<br />The book reads  like a screenplay -- which should be appreciated by TV buffs. Each chapter  is an act, containing a 'scene or two. The set descriptions are good,  although are a bit misplaced, i.e. the setting sun as mango hanging in the  sky dripping juice at the soon-to-be death scene might have worked better  in the scene where Cora was thinking about her long-dead RAF lover.<br />The  writing in &quot;Likeness in Stone&quot; is not as rich as text by P.D.  James, however, the plot moves along at a reasonable clip to a solid  ending. In some of her books, James lingers over detail at the expense of a  tangled ending, although she seems to have overcome that in her last two  books.	2000-05-15

I'm also  concerned about the 'problems'in Northern Ireland.<br />This book is a hard  slog but a fairly good read. I read 10-15 pages at lunch every day and  finally got through it.  It's a very informative book, and quite  illuminating.<br />The British undoubtedly caused many of the problems the  Irish experienced in the past and continue to experience today.  However,  the Irish have had a hard time letting go of the past. What is to be done?  One cannot make the past different, only the present. Although one might  sympathize with the Catholic Irish, and even the IRA, the future must be  different. Protestants are not going back to England or Scotland. In fact,  they can no more return than those of British or Scotish descent living in  North Carolina can go back to the U.K.<br />Read this book to better  understand the dilemmna in Northern Ireland, and the possible ways peace  may be found.	2000-05-13

A few years ago, I visited the Museum of Gardening History on the south embankment of the Thames in London.  The Museum is housed in a former church, and plant specimens from the New World as well as the remains of  Tradescants, the botanists who discovered and classified many of them, are  located on the grounds.<br />The crisp October day I visited the museum,  Tradescantia (blue-flowered Virgina Spiderwort) were in bloom and the  leaves of the Virginia Creeper were turning a bright red. I lingered in  this beautiful spot, reading the inscriptions on the tombstones, and in so  doing discovered the grave of Captain William Bligh.<br />Until that moment,  I had had no idea Bligh was anything other than the dreadful character  portrayed by Charles Laughton in the film &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty.&quot;  That day, I learned he was an educated man who transported a number of  botanists overseas, including the Tradescants, and thereby played an  important role in the collection and classification of plant life.<br />Since  then, I have made it a point to learn all I can about this amazing and much  maligned man. For example, I once lived in Hawaii, and knew Captain Cook  had died at Kealakekua Bay, but I did not know Bligh was on that ill-fated  expedition until I saw the 1980's film &quot;The Bounty&quot; starring Sir  Anthony Hopkins as Bligh. (A far more accurate film than the older  version.)<br />I enjoyed Toohey's book. It is an excellent history: factual,  interesting, balanced. I did not know until I read Toohey's book that Bligh  had distinguished himself during the Napoleonic Wars. This man was truly a  hero, and deserves to be re-discovered and honored for his accomplishments.	2000-05-13

This book addresses one of the oldest mysteries in the world, the &quot;flood&quot; story from the Bible. Some people view the Bible quite literally, while others see the writings as metaphore or allegory. As a  social scientist and former church school teacher, I have come to believe  Bible stories have a mythical quality (in the sociological sense --  designed to instill a code of behavior  and promote the cohesion of a  people), but also have a basis in fact, however altered by time.<br />Archeologists have discovered evidence that many events depicted in the  Bible do indeed have a basis in reality.  Historians and linguists have  shown written text reflects the writers' beliefs and interpretation of  events, as well as the constraints of language. For example, it seems the  city walls fell as a result of the 'Battle of Jerico' but they may have  been demolished when the city was sacked.  Those who told the story (likely  scribes and priests, not soldiers) saw the hand of God at work and  reflected this in their depiction of the events.<br />Many have searched for  the remains of Noah's Ark, but the flood story has always seemed one of the  most tenuous and least likely of Bible events to have left a material  record.  Evidence of past floods and shifting land masses, that might have  formed a basis for the Bible story, reflect events that happened before  humans were around to act as witnesses.<br />William Ryan and Walter Pitman  tell the story of how they inductively arrived at their hypothesis, and  then assembled a great deal of evidence to support it -- that a very big  flood occurred in the area of the Black Sea about 7,5000 years ago (within  the memory of humankind) and this flood may be the basis for the Noah  story.<br />This book reads like a  mystery novel. The main characters are the  scientists themselves, first rate detectives taking note of odd  coincidences, and then actively searching for answers.<br />I have stood on  the southern coast of Spain near Tarifa and looked across at the mountains  of Northern Africa -- so close you feel you could touch them. I can see how  the pounding waves of the Atlantic eventually eroded the rock formations,  and the cold waters rushed through into the Mediterranean Basin.  It  doesn't take much imagination to see the same thing could have happened  where the Bosporus connects the Black Sea to the Mediterranean --  especially if the ice caps had melted and raised the sea level.<br />A great  deal of information not presented in this book supports the theory these  scientists put forth.

I was not surprised when this book won the Pulitzer. I read it a while back but I have returned to it from time to time for clarification about one point or another.<br />As I am about one-eighth Polish, I found the  section on Poland interesting. My great grandparents fled from the Russians  in the middle of the 19th Century, so I am aware of the bad behaviour of  the Russians, the Germans, and then the Russians again.  How the boundaries  of this poor country have been altered over and over.  What a dreary, sad,  but hopeful people. The saying, &quot;Poland isn't a country, it's an  underground conspiracy&quot; is so true. I am happy to read in the papers  that things are finally improving slowly.<br />Ms. Rosenberg contrasts  Czechoslovakia on the verge of becoming Slovakia and the Czech Republic,  with East Germany now reunited with the West. Her descriptions of the  events that led to the very different decisions of these people was lucid  and well written and will be a good resource in years to come.<br />Because  she is a journalist, the book is written to reflect the situation extant in  the early 1990's. Since she wrote the book, some of the political leaders  have changed and various scandals she describes such as the spy incident in  Poland have been more or less resolved or disappeared. The book will retain  value for those who wish to go back and reflect on what happened.	2000-05-13

In her  book, Raver writes reflectively about her return to the family farm in  Maryland and gardening in her 'single' flat in NYC after her divorce.<br />Ms.  Raver reveals she has discovered gardening can provide a theraputic outlet,  that it is a healing actitivy that helps one maintain balance through  life's trials. She shares a tidbits of her inner life as she struggles to  maintian equilibrium and deal with being single, aging parents, and a farm  that can be a challenge most of the time. Some passages read like letters  from a sister or a good friend.<br />The New York Times boasts several garden  writers, and a circulation that encompasses much of the Northeast. I enjoy  Anne's column, though I haven't seen it as much as I used to, which leads  me to hope she may be working on another book.	2000-05-12

General Sherman was right. He said, &quot;War is hell&quot; after his &quot;Christian Soldiers&quot; carried out his scorched earth policy on women, children, livestock, and crops in the Great  Valley of Virginia.<br />The problem with this book is that it starts in the  middle and ends in the middle. The author appears to be recasting the  Crusades from a twentieth century polically correct view. This is not  history, it's propaganda.<br />Just as Abraham Lincolm believed he had a moral  right to wage his war, the Pope believed he had a moral responsibility to  reclaim the Holy Land from conquering invaders of a different religious  persuasion. Until Muslim raiders seized the Holy Land, it had been a  relatively peaceful backwater place in the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine  capital, Constantinople, was threatened by these invaders so the Patriarch  of the Orthodox Christian Church, and the Byzantine Emperor, asked the Pope  for help. The Crusades (lterally taking up the cross for Christ) failed to  stop the Muslim invasions largely because they fell apart before they ever  reached the Holy Land. As a result, Constantinople is now Istanbul, the  once beautiful cathedral of San Sophia is a mosque, and the Greeks and  Turks still don't care very much for each other (or Serbs and Muslims for  that matter).<br />If you want an objective understanding of the  Crusades  and their shortcomings, as well as an understanding of the underlying  reasons for the conflicts that sadly still dominate the countries from  Croatia to Somalia and Ethiopia, read John Julius Norwich's books on  Byzantium.	2000-05-11

I used to cook a lot, but got away from it for many years -- eating out in restaurants while I pursued a career. I read an article about Anne Willan in our local paper, and had to try one of her books.  I'm not ready to make  the fancy French dishes (although I would like to eat them) so I decided to  buy a simple book and practice the basics again.<br />Ms. Willan explains many  basic recipes in this volume. This is a nice cook book to give a new cook,  or it might be a housewarming or bridal gift. I gave it to myself.  I  especially like the photos that show how things should look. There are  photos of how things shouldn't look too, with explanations about why you  got the results you did. I recommend this book if you're beginning for the  first time, or beginning again.	2000-05-11

This book is the culmination of a series of books Weir wrote on the English Kings and Queens from Edward the III to QEI -- approximately the collection of royalty Shakespeare covers in his plays.  If you want to  understand the plays a little better and don't want to become to immersed  in historical detail, Weir's books suit the purpose.<br />Although Weir writes  'popular' history, she does her homework. She does not compile evidence  selectively to support a preconceived theory, or exclude information that  does not suit her purpose. She mentions the conflicting material and  provides her reasons why she reaches the conclusions she does. She uses  primary sources and makes her own inquiries.  She does not  rely solely on  secondary material already subjected to interpretation by a third party.<br />Weir's book on Elizabeth is especially useful if you want to know more  about the relationship between Elizabeth I and Leicester.  It's also useful  if you're planning a trip to England and want to be more informed about the  sites you're sure to visit.	2000-05-10

Goddard's writing evokes a sense of place almost as strong as those created by P.D. James. I don't think all of Goddard's characters are as well drawn  as they might have been, but he does a good job with the Great Uncle,  Christian, and Nicky. &quot;Simone&quot; is over the top at times, and her  character stretched my suspension of disbelief pretty taut.<br />The plot  reminded me of LeCarre's &quot;Perfect Spy&quot; or Deborah Crombie's  &quot;Kissed a Sad Goodbye&quot; with it's the twists and turns and links  between the present action and the events of the past. I found it a  challenge to keep things straight at times, but I anticipated almost every  plot twist before it happened with a few exceptions, so either I'm pretty  good at deciphering mysteries, or the plot isn't as confusing as some  critics have suggested.  I also think it helped to read the book in a 24  hour period.<br />I recommend this book.  It's head and shoulders above many  other mysteries I've read lately by &quot;famous&quot; authors.	2000-05-10

I guess I'm lucky because this was my first Deborah Crombie novel, so I couldn't compare it to earlier &quot;better&quot; works as I read it. I enjoyed it so much, however, I checked out all the other Crombie novels from the library and read them.  I can see a definite progession in her  writing (not the story line between the two detectives but actual  improvement in her ability to develop  her characters.)  She seems to write  more and more satisfying novels as she goes along.<br />While I read  &quot;Kissed a Sad Goodbye&quot; I pulled out one of my maps of London, and  followed the trail.  This may have helped me enjoy it.  I like to follow  maps while I read if the author is naming and describing places. I also may  have enjoyed the book more because I was in the Docklands in last fall, and  walked the tunnel under the Thames to Greenwich and through the little  village itself. I had wanted to see the tunnel since I read P.D. James  novel &quot;Original Sin&quot;.  Mudchute was also featured in  &quot;Playing for the Ashes&quot; written by Elizabeth George, and I think  the area was captured in the film &quot;Career Girls&quot; too.<br />Also, I  am an inveterate tea drinker and fan, so I loved the description of the tea  business.	2000-05-10

When I was a teenager, I saw Lawrence Olivier play Richard III in the film of the same name, and was bowled over. I was so impressed with Richard as he stood on Bosworth field and shouted, &quot;A Horse, A Horse, My Kingdom  for a Horse&quot; that I named my oldest son Richard (I've always told him  he was named for the Lion-Heart whom I admired equally).<br />I was in that  minority of folks who believe Richard really didn't do it..murder his  nephews that is.  After reading Weir's book, I am no longer so certain.  Weir assembles a great deal of compelling evidence to support the  indictment of Richard III for murder. She describes how Richard was very  badly treated by his brother the King and sister-in-law. She implies that  after the King's death, it is quite possible Richard would have been put to  death himself had he not snatched his two nephews (the heir apparent and  his brother) and imprisoned them. Did he have to kill them to  survive?<br />Weir says within the last few decades two little bodies were  found buried deep under a stair well in 'tower' where the boys were last  seen. Maybe someday DNA testing will finally determine if these little  corpses were the ill-fated young princelings.	2000-05-10

In the fifties, when I was growing up in North Carolina, Miss Lawrence was known in garden circles all over the state as she had been an active gardener and writer for a number of years. I am pleased to see &quot;A  Southern Garden&quot; which she wrote in 1942 back in print. RE-reading her  words is like listening to an old friend.<br />She lived and gardened first  in Raleigh, then in Charlotte (both Zone 8). The winters in Zone 7 were a  bit colder, but many of the plants she recommended for Zone 8, survived in  Zone 7 where my family lived and gardened. Given global warming, I think  much of Zone 7, which extends right up the East Coast--almost to New  England (?)--is now verging on becoming Zone 8 -- at least the part that  lies east of the &quot;fall line&quot; on the coastal plain.<br />I have lived  in Arlington, Virginia for a number of years, and have seen a decided shift  in the climate in my area. Crepe Myrtles that used to live no futher north  than Fredericksburg and die back to the ground in Arlington don't.  And  Catbirds, a real southerner are nesting in my yard. Both of these are Zone  8 transplants.<br />Even though I am technicaly in the lower edge of Zone 7, I  can grow almost anything Miss Lawrence discusses in her book &quot;A  Southern Garden&quot; in my garden. My house is on the &quot;fall  line&quot; however, and just west of me the winters are a tad too cold for  some things. But if you live in Zone 7, and like a plant try it. If it  lives great, if not you've gained some wonderful experience.<br />Most  importantly, pay attention to Miss Lawrence when she describes the 'old  timey gardens' -- some say there is nothing new under the sun, and though  that might not be entirely correct, many of the old plant forms she  discusses are still extant.	2000-05-09

The films 'Room With a View' and 'Wings of the Dove' make one wonder about the Italy reflected in classical paintings executed before the destruction of WWII. My curiousity was heightened in an art history class when the instructor showed a photo slide of the Ponte Vecchio and told the amazing  story of the Nazi pilot who disobeyed orders to destroy the last bridge the  allies could cross on their advance north.<br />This beautiful book brings  to mind the saying, &quot;The Past is a Foreign Country.&quot; Italy of the  19th Century is a place none of us can know except through records left by  one who witnessed it. The book consists of essays James wrote on his  travels to various places in Italy including Venice, Rome, and Florence. He  visited some places several times and the text reflects the changes he  observed on revisits.<br />He records an Italy whose poverty for a time  prevented the intrusion of developers, who later made many changes perhaps  for the worse.  James was not a worshipper of old buildings, he appreciated  them, but he was also aware of the suffering of the Italians, many of whom  existed in dire poverty. His reflections on various cathedrals, churches  and other objects of artistic interest are humanized by his comments about  the individuals he encounters. He muses on the morality of travel,  &quot;whether it has been worthwhile to leave his home  [and] encounter new  forms of human suffering.&quot;  His awareness of the Italians themselves  makes his writing a bit like that of Paul Theroux, a travler and writer in  our times.  James differs from Theroux however. My sense is that James is a  little less likely to criticize and a little more willing to overlook  unpleasantness. Perhaps that makes him less of a realist, or perhaps Italy  was a more pleasant place in the 19th Century.	2000-05-09

I have used this book for years as my gardening bible. I have an edition with a foreward signed by James Bush-Brown and Louise Bush-Brown in Ambler Pennsylvania, September 1957.  I'm glad to see the book has been updated,  but what amazes me is that the older version is still so useful. Just this  morning I looked up 'Hyssop' because I planted one in the back of my herb  bed. The entry read, &quot;P; 18-24&quot; Seed: medicine, perfume, food --  Sunny; ordinary garden soil, not too rich. Prefers lime.&quot;  This entry  (in Chapter IX, The Herb Garden) told me the plant was a pernnial, would  not overshadow my other plants, and would grow well in my herb garden which  is laced with lime.<br />This book is succinct, useful, and too heavy to  carry to bed for nighttime reading.	2000-05-09

The seeds can be sown in fall or early spring. The seedlings must be thinned, and Mrs. Clarkson says she saves every scrap that is pulled up.  She uses them in potato salad,  and sprinkles them over broiled lamb.&quot;<br />Miss Lawrence has distilled  much of her gardening and some of her cooking knowledge into this lovely  little book (about 250 pages). Ideas abound from sources such as old wives  tales, myths, stories, poetry, and the miscellaneous information passed  along to Miss Lawrence from her correspondents, friends, and readers.  Reading this text is like sitting at a wise woman's knee and listening to  her tell about  past times.<br />Will it rain on Saint Swithin's Day (July  15th) as it did in 971 A.D when his body was transferred from a forgotten  grave to the Cathedral for a proper burial? Were the Chinese, who  considered the frog the lord of waters onto something, &quot;Send soon O  frog the jewel of water.&quot;<br />But my favorite writing is the poetry she  intersperses into the text -- &quot;A bank where the wild thyme blows,  Where Oxlips and the nodding Violet grows, Quite over canopied with lucious  woodbine, with sweet musk-roses and with eglantine.&quot;  Planted any  eglantine lately..?	2000-05-09

I've read 'The Hidden Book in the Bible', 'Who Wrote the Bible' and 'The Disappearance of God' -- on my own, not as part of a course or study group. As a social scientist, I have an  understanding of religious and belief systems that was formulated though  years of academic training. However, I also believe in a Higher Power and I  taught Church School for a number of years, though currently I am not  involved with any formal religious group.<br />Because I have had and  continue to acquire a  secular education (many courses in anthropology,  archeology, sociology, psychology), I am familiar with the serious doubts  many folks have about the existence of God.  This book does not prove or  disprove the existence of God. No book can do that.<br />The 'Hidden Book in  the Bible' is a very scholarly work on the origins and content of the  &quot;J&quot; narrative thought to be buried in the first books of the  Bible. Scholars disagree on the exact content of the &quot;J&quot;  narrative (even for them a leap of faith is required) but Elliott has  presented a solid and learned argument and his writing is clear and  understandable.<br />Whether you are studying the &quot;world's  religions&quot; for a sociology or anthropology class, interested in  literature, teaching Bible School, or just want a good read, you will enjoy  this book.	2000-05-08

When I find an author I like, I read as many books as I can by that author. MY favorite Atwood books are 'Lady Oracle' and 'Life Before Man.'  When I read these books, I had the experience of playing  &quot;catch-up&quot; with an old friend I hadn't seen in a while. You  know...you care about them,  they've been away, and you have to hear all  their news.<br />Usually, a friend has little endearing quirks you  recognize--a favorite use of phrase or an overused word which you see or  hear and say to yourself -- &quot;Yup, that's her all over.&quot;  With  Atwood, I sometime feel my friend has multiple personalities.<br />The  protagonist in this book is hard to &quot;get next to&quot; although you  care about her. She's the friend who hasn't always been very good to  herself, sometimes you want to shake her and say fight back, and sometimes  you want to protect her but you know she's got to stand up for herself.  Then one day she begins to change and you breathe a sigh of relief because  you were getting tired of the beating she was taking.<br />I hand off many of  my books to others, but I kept this one (it's a paperback).  I couldn't  tell you why as I don't think I'll read it again.  It affected me on some  level, and I'm glad I read it.  I still like 'Lady Oracle' better though.	2000-05-08

I've been gardening for many years -- everything from a two-acre spread to a small urban garden but I never had to  &quot;think small&quot; until I moved to the big city. This book has proved  very helpful for resizing thoughts.<br />In &quot;The Little Bulbs,&quot;  Miss Lawrence covers everything from miniature daffodils to sqill, from  crocuses to irises. Did you know there were miniature irises? Most if not  all of the bulbs she describes are still around, and many more varieties  exist besides, but this book will get you started and keep you going  awhile. I haven't found anything newer with better practical  knowledge.<br />Even if you own an estate, this book can help you. Miss  Lawrence has a nice section on container planting which the British have  done for years, and we are just beginning to do really well.  Remember,  bulbs exist for every climate.  You can grow the tropical kind in-doors in  colder areas (amaryllids), and grow those that require cold outside if you  have freezing weather in winter. I like this book so much, I am ordered the  hardcover to replace my old paperback which I'm giving to my daughter who  is just beginning to garden.	2000-05-07

(I bought apaper-back version in 1985 ........, and have used ever since.) A big Walnut Tree shades my  back yard and I alternately curse and bless it.  I want a cool patio on a  hot summer afternoon, but the Walnut tree makes gardening a challenge.  Using Schenk's book, I have learned how to grow pleasing and pretty plants  in the dry shade under it.<br />Probably the best part of Schenk's book is his  discussion of trees and shrubs.  Many gardeners, even experienced ones, pay  the least amount of attention to the trees affecting the ground they are  trying to cultivate.  Trees do matter.  Some trees create more problems  than others. Most of us discover too late that Maple trees are not the  gardeners' best friend. (Those cute little maple trees from the Japanese  hybridists are a possible exception.) Mr. Schenk shares many good thoughts  on making a beautiful, not just passable garden under your shade tree(s).	2000-05-07

The author works for the wonderful Brooklyn Botanic Garden in NYC and if you haven't been--go. Ms Marinelli writes well, and I find her style pleasing. She is not preachy, but she does raise some hard  questions. Unlike most writers warning us of our bad behaviour and it's  affect on the future, she does not attempt to scare the reader, but rather  she puts forth a reasonable discussion of the alternatives.<br />Each of us  must make some sacrifice for the greater good. And although that word has a  negative connotation, until one gets the hang of delayed gratification one  cannot realize the payoff is usually 5 times better than the result of  immediate gratification.<br />Think of the grassy lawn. Grassy lawns are not  native to the U.S. They are bad, bad things. And although giving them up is  hard to do, the alternative can be very pleasing. I have entirely replaced  my grass lawn with ground covers and they look better most of the year than  the grass ever did. Did you know there is a Creeping Thyme that looks like  grass, grows in the hot hot sun, and needs no additional watering during  the long hot summer. It looks fabulous next to a walk (especially white  marble chips).<br />The message of Ms. Marinelli's book is that there are  alternaives ways of attaining gratification, and we will all be better off  if we seek them.	2000-05-07

I don't live in NC anymore, but when I did, Miss Lawrence wrote a garden column and was known all over the state by garden club members like my mom who met her at least once. We lived in Guilford County which is part of the  Greensboro-High Point MSA these days and she lived in Raleigh to the east,  and then Charlotte to the south. Anyway, she understood what would and  wouldn't work in the Zone 7 garden. (I still live in Zone 7 -- in  Virginia).<br />Miss Lawrence was the first writer to educate gardeners in our  circles about the differences in growing regions.  She corresponded with  folks in other places and shared information about what was happening in  their gardens with her column readers. She also informed readers about  information she gleaned from the Market Bulletins.  These bulletins were  posted by folks who had something to offer or wanted something  --gardenwise. The only expense involved much of the time was postage.<br />This book is a fascinating compilation of articles Miss Lawrence wrote  about the Market Bulletins.  The sections are filled with newsy notes and  humor, and makes one feel as if she is hanging over the garden gate getting  the latest news from a neighbor up the road. Great bed time reading.	2000-05-07

I was one of the 'blessed' because I actually read Mr. Mitchell's columns (both of them) for years. I live in the Washington DC area, and subscribed to the  Post. Those of us who gardened locally were twice blessed because he was  not only one of the best garden writers ever, he struggled with the heat,  humidity, and high winds that attack us from all sides.  Whenever I am in  my garden I think of him. When I look at my Japanese Anemones I remember he  said &quot;Once you have them you'll always have them.&quot; There have  been times when I thought for sure they were goners, but they always  survived. When I see a little plant struggling under a bush, I remember him  saying, &quot;One of these days I'll have to crawl under there and pull it  out.&quot;  When I see a fish tank, I think of him and his horse trough. I  miss him.	2000-05-07

I can visualize Mrs. White working away in one of her gardens, E.B. reclining on a lawn chair.  He dozes off, and when he wakes finds a lovely garden spider has spun it's  web exactly over his head. &quot;Charlotte&quot; he exclaims!<br />Mrs.  White's articles were written several decades ago, and they reflect an era  many cannot recall. (The median age of the U.S. population is about 30 so  most residents were born after she wrote many of these articles.)<br />This  was an era of elegance, white gloves, hats, and ladies luncheons--though  Mrs White also worked fulltime for the New Yorker Magazine. Mr. White muses  in the forward to this book that when they lived at their Maine home, every  day before noon Mrs. White would arrive from the cutting garden with  mud-ringed Ferragamos and arrange flowers for the dining room table.  Well,  I would never abuse my Ferragamos, but it's lovely to bring fresh flowers  from the garden into the house.<br />Mrs. White had many uses for flowers.  &quot;Goldenrod...can be made into a crown of gold for a Harvest Queen or a  necklace for a child.&quot;  Her words evoke the more carfree days of a  childhood when there were many fields about, and most children rich or poor  could fashion a necklace of golden flowers. Riches indeed.<br />In an age when  many gardeners are overly concerned with design, Katherine White reminds us  Nature creates much more visually beautiful spaces than mere mortals can,  and perhaps we better work to save the remaining space.

I am a big fan of the &quot;Best American Short Stories&quot; series, an annual collection compiled and published by the Houghton Mifflin Company because I can't get around to reading all those great stories in all those  great magazines flooding the market.  I've been behind for so long, I was  glad when I recently discovered a collection entitled &quot;Best American  Short Stories of the Century&quot; edited by John Updike -- a sort of best  of the best.<br />Some years, I have found the annual anthology more  appealing, and some years less so. &quot;The Best American Short Stories,  1999&quot; edited by Amy Tan is very entertaining and more memorable than  the collections of the past few years.  My acid test is this -- can I  remember today the gist of a story I read last month? In other words, did  it leave a lasting impression?  Tan's selections are holding up pretty  well. I won't soon forget 'The Hermit's Story', the first entry in her  book. I discovered something very remarkable when I read it, but I can't  share it because I don't want to ruin the story for you.<br />These  anthologies reflect the taste of the guest editor, as well as the skill of  the chosen writers, but why not?  Katrina Kenison, the Series Editor, says  there's a surfeit of great material, so why shouldn't the guest editor  reflect her outlook with her selection.<br />I think Tan's stories show she  is very interested in the 'minority' viewpoint.  You might imagine this  occurs because Amy Tan is a Chinese descent American, and maybe it does.  However, when I use the term minority I mean interestingly idiosyncratic.<br />Odd and unusual people populate these stories, and odd things happen to  them.  Of course, if they didn't have unusual experiences we might not find  the energy to finish the page. But oddity alone is not enought to sustain  the reader.  One has to experience a connection with the character.  I came  to care what happened to most of these oddballs.<br />Visualize Pam Houston's  character, a young woman who says, &quot; When I was four years old and  with my parents in Palm Beach, Florida, I pulled a seven-hundred-pound  cement urn off its pedestal and onto my legs crushing both femurs.&quot;  Or, consider this excerpt from Melissa Hardy's tale, &quot;'Once,' Mrs  Flowers told George, 'she ate a whole pile of socks I was fixing to darn.  Another time she ate a Bible'.&quot; I feel frustration, sorrow, and/or  amusement when I read these words. The stories grip, they entertain, they  amuse.

2497022:US	51379338	R3ONTAZLJHWVWW	067940256X	566124428	Rembrandt's Eyes	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Artistic insight	One of my favorite paintings is &quot;The Polish Rider&quot; purportedly by Rembrandt.  A few years ago , I read a disheartening article in The New Yorker Magazine about a panel of international Rembrandt experts who had  decided Rembrandt did not paint &quot;The Polish Rider.&quot;  Later that  same year, I was in Amsterdam and had an opportunity to visit the Six House  and the painting of Jan Six by Rembrandt.  I had a long conversation with  the young art critic who was the curator/guide at the house. He assured me  the Rembrant panel was correct in their assumption that &quot;The Polish  Rider&quot; had not been painted by Rembrandt. I suggested whether or not  Rembrandt painted it, it is a fabulous painting, and I asked this young man  if he had ever seen the painting--he had not.<br />After visiting the Six  House, I sat outside on a bench with one of the gardeners and he told me  how he felt the day he saw U.S. paratroopers dropping from the sky to save  the Netherlands from the Nazis.  He said his faith had been restored that  day but he would not have belived it if he hadn't seen it with his own  eyes.<br />I hope it doesn't sound too trite to say that reading Schma's  book restored my faith in my own opinion. Schama says he believes Rembrandt  did indeed paint &quot;The Polish Rider&quot; and thereby places himself at  odds with a formidable group of experts.  Schama also presents empirical  evidence why he beieves these experts are wrong.<br />But you be the judge.  Form your own opinion.  Go to New York, visit the painting, and look into  the soldier's eyes. I think you will agree who painted this masterpiece.  But first, take the time to read Schama's book.	2000-05-04

I've read the Nichols' trilogy ('Merry Hall', 'Sunlight on the Lawn', 'Laughter on the Stairs') and recommmend them all, but I enjoyed this one the most.  Maybe that's because I live in an urban area, have a small  odd-shaped yard,  a cat and two dogs, and nutty neighbors. I'm always  looking for ways to make my garden more private, overcome awkward features,  and squeeze in more and more plants.  This little book is a 'history' of  how Nichols accomplished just that.  He took an odd shaped city lot and  turned it into a pretty little garden overcoming all sorts of obstacles  including a very nosy neighbor. As I read this book, I kept thinking why  leave--even if the move was to Merry Hall.  I suppose a gardener can only  arrange and dig up the yard so many times before the need to seek new  ground arises.  If you want some ideas about how to deal with your little  urban plot until you move to your country estate, read this book.  It's  filled with cats, friends, flowers and laughter, and a great read before  bedtime.	2000-05-04

This isn't &quot;The Ice House&quot; but Minnette Walters writes extremely well, and on a bad day is better than most other writers in her genre.  Every story I've read--and I've read them all--is self contained, so we never know who is bad, who is good or who is guilty--it could even be the  policeman investigating the crime.  Walters used to write romances, which  may be why there's always a little love interest in her books--not  unwelcome by this reader.  She doesn't write soap operas with  self-absorbed, shallow characters however. Her characters are  less-than-perfect as most of us are, but attempting to live relatively  happy lives.  Some you remember long afterward. Who could forget &quot;The  Sculptress&quot;. Walter's plots are good to excellent--this one is  excellent--and she ties the loose ends together.<br />&quot;The Breaker is a  sad book, but some of the characters see a glimmer of hope at the end. The  victim was not above reproach, but she was loved, and she left a small  child behind. The killer is a misogynist not surprisingly, but a huge  misunderstanding has caused him to become a murderer.  The main character  in this book is the southcoast of England.  Anglophiles like me will love  Walter's description of the coastal area just southwest of Southhampton  (her maps helped, but drag out your own just for fun). Her discription of  the role of the tides and currents in the crime scene is fascinating.  Oh,  that's another thing Walters does, her homework.	2000-05-02

If you want an easy to read and mildly entertaining book for a long flight somewhere-this is the book for you. The characters are sterotypical--including a career policeman with a failed marriage, his professional but meddlesome girl-friend, a troubled child, her caring  teacher, an embittered husband (of the corpse-natch), and gypsies not much  different from Auntie Mabel and Uncle Herbert who bought a camper for  traveling around the U.K.  Heck, this book isn't even scary.  Granger will  make a mistake if she marries the two main characters at some point--then  there'll be no tension.  Well, I read it anyway, but hey, I'm home sick  today with a head cold.	2000-05-02

God forbid anything should happen to him as he's the best thing in the book. Maybe I am cynical  after years of reading P.D. James, Colin Dexter, and others, but I am  getting a bit tired of Geoffrey Mappestone's goody-two shoes behaviour. I  don't want him to be bad, just a little more human.<br />Geoffrey is the  product of a mega-dysfunctional family and he's spent years surving in the  Holy Lands as a Crusader. He's in his thirties and as as far as I know  (after two books) he doesn't even know what sex is. Even Cadfael had an  affair. Also, Beaufort's 21st Century ruminations about the morality of the  Crusades are getting a bit old. The author is an historian, but as nearly  as I can tell from my reading, hisorians disagree about the Crusades. At  least one school  says the West would be a very different place if the  Jihad had succeeded. Call me sentimental, but I much prefer Ellis Peters  views of the Crusades via Cadfael. I am aware the Crusades mostly failed,  but I think the one Cadfael and Mappestone participated in was at least  motivated by good intentions. I know Constantinople was sacked by Crusaders  later on--probably why it eventually fell and that the Albigensians were  destroyed. However, the infidels who wreaked havoc on the Byzantine  Empire--including the Levant were not &quot;good&quot; guys. And, the  eye-for-an-eye, slavery, and enshrouded women still exist in the Middle  East.<br />My biggest objection to this book, however, is it's failure to be  a good mystery. Writers like Penman, Peters, and Candice Robb write  historical mysteries that sometimes 'modifiy' the truth--whatever that  is--but they never subvert their tale by constantly dropping in value laden  judgments concerning the times which tend to get the reader &quot;off  story.&quot;  Peters novels contain  comments about the futility of war,  especially civil war, but she doesn't take sides with Stephen or Maude and  she doesn't beat the reader over the head.  Why shouldn't Mappestone take a  similar objective stance about the Crusades. He can certainly have a moral  center and engage in acts of kindness without constantly harping about  pillaging knights.<br />Second, Beaufort's plot itself is a bit thick.  There are so many false starts (not red herrings) one cannot reconstruct  what happened--even after Mappestone explains it. A good mystery writer  lays a trail the reader can follow, so that step by step you think you're  getting somewhere. Sometimes you even work out the story a step before the  detective. Each new plot twist Beaufort introduces seems to force  Geoffrey--and the reader--to backtrack and start over again. A certain  amount of that is expected or the story is dull and boring, but I was  exhausted by the end of this book.<br />I think a mystery must start with a  central question for which an elementary answer is provided. Veteran  readers know the initial answer is always (well usually) wrong. Bits of  information are added as the investigator goes about his business and  determines what is relevant (or seems to be, but mostly is) and what is  not. A good tale often has several subplots, but they must come together in  a logical way when the investigator finally unravels the mystery. The best  authors work in subtle red herrings that may or may not be explained. Some  plot elements are so obvious both the investigator and the reader fall over  them together but they should never be so obtuse that the reader cannot say  at the end with a slap on the forehead, &quot;Why didn't I get that! &quot;  or &quot;Wow, am I smart, I figured that out!&quot;<br />Thirdly, a reader is  willing to accept a certain amount of 'suspension of disbelief' but this is  a mystery after all, not science fiction. One of the reasons some mysteries  are better is because you learn something while you have fun. I don't want  to learn blatent lies.  Did anyone really understand lead was poisonous  until modern times--if so, why not put that in the historical footnote.  Did Geoffrey learn about chemicals in the Holy Land the way Cadfael came to  understand the properties of herbs from Miriam?<br />On my scale of  historical mystery writers, Beaufort is a 4, Robb is a 6, Penman and Peters  are 8's and Colin Dexter a 10 (an historical novel set in the 19th century  that Morse solves--from his hospital bed).poisonous  until modern times--if so, why not put that in the historical footnote.

I'm a fairly successful gardener. People stop on my street and admire my flowers. Many friends and acquaintances ask for advice. I wish I  had written this book, it says what I want to say.  Learning to garden is a  process of bringing forth what already exists inside you. One learns to  garden through trial and error, and what works in one garden may not work  in another. Cookie cutter directions simply don't work, and when one  follows them and fails, one feels like a failure. Nollman writes about  gardening in his part of the world, which is not like your part of the  world or my part of the world, but the thoughts he shares transcend these  differences. There are two major approaches to gardening: one  organic--spiritual and esthetic; the other nonorganic and ugly. To be  content, Nollman says, all you need is love and an organic garden. Nothing  works if you work against nature (probably the reason our forebears were  thrown out of Eden). WHY WE GARDEN helped me maintain the link between the  inner gardener I was born to be and Gaia.	2000-03-24

The storyline builds on Shakespeare's  &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; so the play's the thing to read initially.  According to the dust jacket, this is the author's first book-length  mystery (he is a lawyer by day), and while his ingenuity is apparent, this  is as polished a piece as any of the grenre.  Familiarity with the 13th  Century is probably not necessary, but some of the &quot;jests&quot; must  be better appreciated by one with a sensitivity to the conflicts of the  period--betwen Guelph and Ghibelline, Saracen and Crusader, Rome and  Constantinople, and Albigensian and Orthodox.  The only complaint I have is  the books brevity--must come from writing briefs.	2000-01-23

I read anything I can about the Benelux countries because I am a descendent of Dutch settlers who emigrated from Groningen and Zeeland to Grand Rapids Michigan in the 1860s.  One branch of our family lived in Sint  Maartensdyke for at least 500 years.  Why leave after all that time? One of  the most important approaches to understanding the lives of our own  ancestors is reading history. Having discovered real human beings who lived  through the periods depicted by Israel, Schma, and other historians has  helped me to better appreciate what my ancestors might have experienced and  why they made the decisions they did.  Why do the Mennonites suddenly  disappear from our family tree?  I learned from Israel and Schma  Mennonites were persecuted (we must have switched rather than fight).  I  learned from Schma that the Dutch farmers turned out in droves to fight  Napolean at Waterloo. It gave me goosebumps because I never imagined before  I might have had an ancestor at Waterloo.  I have learned about the  shipping business and various battles for control of the sea.  I had an  ancestor who was the skipper of a ship, now I have some insight into his  life. The ancient relationship between the Dutch and the English is  fascinating.  I have an ancestor named Inglesman--which means Englishman in  Dutch.	1999-09-19
