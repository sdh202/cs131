PI Tess Monahan is amonst the onlookers at this annual pilgrimage, when two caped visitors approach the gravesite... a shot rings out and one figure falls to the ground while the other escapes. When Tess recieves a visit from a strange, round ,little man who wants her to locate some mysterious missing goods connected with Poe, she and her boyfriend Crow become involved in a case of murder, theft, stalking and obbsessive collecting, all of which revolves around the life of Poe. I didn't really care all that much for this book, as I found it to be very muddled and rather difficult to follow. I've loved the previous books featuring Tess and Co., so hope that the next one is more appealing.	2005-10-12

Police Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer is officially off duty and having dinner and a few drinks with her close girlfriends when an emergency call comes in from her old friend and former partner, Inspector Warren Jacobi. The pair had tried to follow a black Mercedes recently, following an horrific murder, but had lost it in the ensuing chase. Now Jacobi has been called to an identical murder and is following a black Mercedes which, he suspects, holds the killers. When Lindsay joins Jacobi in his car, she warns him that she's had a couple of drinks but is no way impaired and won't be driving. A high speed chase takes place and the Mercedes crashes, causing Lindsay and Jacobi to holster their guns and go to the rescue of what turns out to be a pair of very young teenagers. The pair allows themselves to be rescued but then change from a pair of frightened children into cold blooded killers as they gun down both of the police officers. Lindsay has to fight for her career and reputation in the civil trial which follows, and retreats to her sister's house on the coast for a bit of R and R. Unbelievably, almost as soon as she arrives, a series of gruesome murders takes place, with the victims being slashed, gutted and whipped. Lindsay and the local Police Chief finally catch the killers, but not before the reader is taken on a breathless race against some very scary people.	2005-10-11

Widowed Zoe and her mother in law Winifred, have always been at loggerheads, with Winifred insisting that her late son married beneath him, and, because of her stubborness and pride, has cut off contact with Zoe and her daughter, Katie. Saying that she would need to see the property before investing her money and, not mentioning the fact that she has a serious illness looming, she comes for a visit and immediately puts everyone's back up with her domineering ways and arrogance. Katy has also moved in with her mother after the death of her severely handicapped daughter, but without knowing any of the details of Winifred's hurtful attitude to Zoe and her refusal to help in the years following the death of Zoe's husband, cuts through the barrier of years to become very attached to her grandmother. This is the story of three generations of women of the same family, trying to bond, trying to forgive and trying to make sense of their lives at this point. I don't know that I'd be quite as forgiving to such a hurtful person, even if I did know her background and some of the reasons for her behaviour, but then, perhaps I'm not of such a generous spirit as these women!	2005-10-09

Sam Flood is an Australian mathematician who has decided to search out her roots, after discovering that her paternal grandmother came to Australia as a result of the now infamous relocation scheme for children from orphanages and those who had been abandoned by their parents. Sam locates a local woman who had been a fellow traveler on the ship and who tells a horrified Sam about the barbaric treatment given by church authorities and social service organisations, to those helpless children... a time of great shame in Australian history! Miguel Madero, known as Mig, is the son of a noble Spanish house and is recovering from a bad fall, taken when he was rock climbing, during a break from his studies at a seminary. Unsure whether or not to return to the seminary as he is reconsidering his vocation to the priesthood, Mig also travels to Illthwaite to do some research for his doctorate in the history of religious persecution in 16th century England, with particular interest in an ancestor with the same name. The locals close ranks when Sam and Mig, separately and together, question them about several deaths and a suicide which could affect their research, and Reginald Hill takes this opportunity to introduce lots of fascinating characters, all worthy of a place in an English murder/mystery novel. I found this to be a great read with overtones of murder,historical themes and complex characters crowding the pages, and just enough sex to keep it interesting.	2005-10-09

When the sales of her books begin to dry up, her publisher suggests that she gets out into the real world to gain some life experience, instead of slavishly copying the writing styles of writers of previous generations like Mickey Spillane. Jannie and her friend Dick Fleming plan a jewellery theft and getaway plan, exactly as if it were actually going to happen, even to the point of contacting a group of men of dubious character, to be their gang. Needless to say, it all gets out of hand and the adventurous, amateur crooks find themselves involved in real crime and the marks for mob heavies. It was all quite exciting, with Jannie dressing and acting like a floosie and sleeping with two men at the same time, but so highly improbable that it suspends belief.	2005-10-05

The pilot loses control of the plane under these conditions and, when the plane goes down, Perry is marooned on a tiny island in the Caribbean from which all the inhabitants have been evacuated. Being stranded on this mile long island for four days gives our intrepid hero the chance to wander around at leisure and, with the help of a handy Geiger counter which was left in a safe, which of course he was able to crack, finds unaccepably high levels of radiation in the area, formerly used for growing fancy mushrooms. Perry is rescued from the island, where he kept himself alive by drinking milk from a herd of cows, by a team of people dressed in anti- radiation suits, and who return him, blindfolded, to Miami. The plot is thickened by a consortium of would be crooks, intent on dealing with the ingredients of bomb making, encounters with shadowy figures from MI6 and an assortment of race course habituees who wander in and out of the plot. Of course our hero, whom I neglected to mention, is not only a handsome and charming TV weatherman, but has also a PH.D in physics, sorts everything out, separates the goodies from the baddies, and gets the girl.	2005-10-03

It's also the story of the first time that DNA was used in solving a crime. The girls were killed four years apart, both being young and both virgins. The killer  raped and sodomised the girls before strangling them, merely pulling their bodies off the beaten village pathway. It's not a pretty story but the true account of the extraordinary effort by the police to find the killer, eventually using the new method of DNA testing from blood and semen samples given by thousands of local men and boys, and called by the police \\"blooding\\". The staggering thing is that the killer was, and is, a sociopath who has absolutely no conscience or feeling that what he did was in any way wrong, and that while he wasn't labeled as criminally insane, even with these horrific crimes, he is simply a vile man whose mind is wired in this way. He received a double life sentence but without any specific time put on his detention. I hope that he is still in jail.	2005-10-02

Twenty something years previously, a small girl was kidnapped and presumed murdered, from a henge of standing stones in Avebury. Her sister was killed when she ran on to the road in an attempt to stop the car, leaving the children's nanny to take the blame for the whole affair. Years later, the nanny was thought to have suicided but her former husband, historian David Umber recieves a call from the now retired police Chief Inspector, George Sharpe, who was in charge of the kidnapping case, to ask his help in reopening the inveatigation. It's a story with many characters and many threads, which are so interwoven that, at times, it seemed to bog down under such a wealth of detail, and then, just when I found the going becoming a bit tedious, the author zooms you back with an exciting lead. It's clever writing, bound together with genuine historical facts about an 18th century political polemicist, Junius, whose writings are documented. It's a good read but not for those with a short attention span.	2005-10-01

This summer he has elected to spend his holiday weeks at the seaside town of Brighton. The year is 1882, and the town is alive with the fashionable and the would be fashionable, who spend their days either promenading or taking part in the newly fashionable sea bathing, descending from bathing machines pulled right on to the edge of the water, and delicately immersing themselves for the good of their health. Moscrop becomes entranced by an attractive young woman, mother of a small child and step mother to an aggressive, thoroughly objectionable teenaged boy, and does everything he can to engineer an introduction to her. Her elderly husband, Doctor Prothero, is a flirtatious man who largely ignores his wife, and who makes sure that he is free in the evenings to pursue his amorous attentions to a local beauty, by insisting that his wife takes a dose of Chloral to make her sleep soundly. When the dismembered body of a young woman is discovered, buried in the sand of the seashore, the local police call on the services of Scotland Yard veterans, Sergeant Cribb and Constable Thackeray, and not only are the members of the Prothero family involved, but Albert Moscrop's voyeuristic tendencies come under the attention of the police.	2005-09-30

The story continues through their study years, marriages, love affairs and business successes. Of course, there is lots of drama and breast beating as the story progresses through several wars, straying husbands and recalcitrant children, but it's all a bit too much like a soapie for me to really enjoy...an ok read !	2005-09-27

A precociously aware, yet innocent little girl has been left with the owner of a struggling restuarant and his wife, to raise, by her mother, a woman on the fringes of show business, who cares for no one but herself. The child, Lovejoy, becomes obsessed with the idea of creating a garden in the ruins of a bombed out church, and enlists the aid of a local boy, Tip Malone. When they remove earth from a nearby enclosed garden, they are prosecuted by Miss Angela Chesney, an opinionated, domineering woman who can see no other path in life except her own, and who rules even her elder, more compassionate sister with the iron fist of mockery. It's a short story but one which made me laugh and cry because I could feel the sheer frustration, as well as the determination of Lovejoy as she battles the inexorable might of the adult world, a world which can not, or will not, see things from a child's perspective. I'm sorry that I've missed this beautiful book until now, but am grateful to have found it in an op-shop.	2005-09-25

Daniel is the only son of one of the most highly regarded Rabbis in the US, a direct descendant of a line of Orthodox Jews, and the expected next leader of this congregation. Timothy is a typical New York street urchin, bastard son of a mentally ill woman and is being raised by his aunt and uncle. Timothy is employed by the Rabbi to perform the Sabbath eve tasks of switching off the lights etc. which cannot be performed by the Jewish faithful, and so meets Daniel and his sister Deborah, a devout and pious girl who is destined to become the young wife of a Rabbi. The children grow up with their lives intermittently intertwining, to form the nucleus of a somewhat predictable, but nonetheless enjoyable, story of conflicting religions, love and much soul searching in young people who are torn between various religious traditions and the very human aspects of love and family.	2005-09-24

Ambitious young politician, Oliver Russell marries the daughter of a US Senator, to become the Governor of a small Southern state. His father-in-law has plans for him to move all the way to the White House, thinking that he had control of a puppet who could be manipulated at his whim. Leslie Stewart was engaged to be married to Oliver before he jilted her to marry the Senator's daughter, and has vowed to seek revenge on him ever since. She marries a wealthy older man from whom she inherits a vast fortune which she uses to buy newspapers and tv stations, from which to launch a campaign of hatred and vengeance on Oliver, who is now President. Other players in this story include a beautiful on-camera war correspondent, an eager journalist who sees a possible Pulitzer prize in sight and the usual gofers and hangers-on of powerful men. It's really what could be described as an airport read with short, staccato sentences and paragraphs which can be picked up again without any trouble.	2005-09-21

The body of her informant is found dead upstairs, having been shot so as to kill both her and her soon to be born child. Vicki sets out to solve both murders with the help of a beautiful black woman, Reheema, who has just been released from jail where she was held for a year for refusing to testify as to where she obtained two guns. Vicki knows that Reheema is somehow connected to the drug scene through her mother, a known user. The quest takes them back to that same neighbourhood where the murders took place and where they stake out suspect crack houses, and see open drug dealing in a formerly decent, if poor, area, which is now a place of fear for the inhabitants. It's a very pacy, exciting book, peopled by characters who are only too real in this day and age.	2005-09-21

Fran reluctantly accepts the commission, only because Mickey is holding her dog as hostage until the job is done, and travels to Oxford, where it's thought that Lisa may be staying with her parents. Mickey has booked Fran into a B and B, owned by Beryl, one of his former employees, where she joins a curiously disparate group of residents which includes a Croatian woman who is working for Beryl as a chambermaid, in order to improve her English. Fran locates Lisa who agrees to meet her by the river, but as Fran waits for her arrival, the body of another Croatian, Ivo, the doorman at Mickeys' club, floats to the bank of the river. Understandably alarmed, Fran conceals her knowledge of his identity from the police, much to the alarm of her buddy, Ganesh, with whom she has kept in touch by means of his mobile phone which she has borrowed. As Frans' investigation progresses, Lisa proves to be very far from the innocent victim she has portayed herself to be to both her parents and to Mickey, and lots of action occurs before the satisfactory conclusion of Frans' case. Fran is a very likeable and believable heroine and I'd like to read more about her adventures.	2005-09-18

A three year old boy is taken from his garden and found shortly after, strangled and sexually mutilated. The polce soon charge two 10/11 year old boys with the crime, but, as one of the boys is the cousin of copy girl Patricia ( Paddy) Meehans' fiance, she takes a personal interest in the case and is convinced that an adult had a large hand in the crime. Paddy is a product of her generation and her social surroundings, struggling against the frightening probability that she'll succumb to pressure and conform to the local norm of marriage and motherhood at an early age, when the general attitude is that any girl who wants to pursue a career, is \\" fast\\" and \\" no better than she ought to be\\". Adding to the ordinary pressure to which a girl of her background, in Glasgow, is subjected, the added burden of a strict Catholic family, with rigid rules of behaviour, serves to increase her sense of non worth...the typical reaction of an overweight girl who has never felt pretty or treated as desirable. The crime occupies only a small part of the story which concentrates on the sexism and patronising attitudes of a newspaper to its junior, female staff. Paddy enlists the support of a cynical, dying, former top newspaper man, who helps her to ferret out the real villain, and who saves her life when her brush with evil becomes terrifyingly close. I am looking forward to continuing the story of Paddy as she matures and blooms.	2005-09-17

Brenna and Colm Caffrey arrive from Ireland with just the clothes on their backs, in 1920, following a call from Colm's brother, to whom they had entrusted their only money, ten pounds, won on a bet. When the brother fails to appear, they begin to walk from the dock with their two small sons and with Brenna heavily pregnant. When the baby starts to come, she is forced to sit in the basement doorway of a large house, until the housekeeper takes her inside for the birth. At the same time, the mistress of the house is upstairs, also in labour and the two women have their baby daughters in the same hour. The story continues with the fate of the Caffrey's entwined with the family in the big house, with deaths, marriages, births and every possible drama happening that actually does happen in real life. I suppose it's easy to label this as chick lit or, even more damning, a nice \\"Ladies\\" book, but if you're in the mood for a non taxing read, like the comfort of an old dressing gown, this is the book for you.	2005-09-15

Precious Ramotswe is the survivor of an abusive marriage and was the mother of a baby who lived for only five days after marrying against her fathers' advice. She devoted herself to caring for Daddy, as she called him, for the rest of his life, agreeing with his plans for her to start her own business. Daddy had visions of her running a butcher shop or some other lucrative business, but, instead, Precious decides to follow in the shadow of one of her heroines, Agatha Christie, and sets up the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency, complete with an office, a secretary and a tiny white van for following and surveillance work. Clients begin to trickle in slowly with Precios being asked mainly to follow errant husbands, but, as her reputation for common sense and reliable work grows, she is soon asked to consult on crimes of theft, suspected witchcraft and unlicensed medical practices. As a size 22, generously built African lady, Precious is an unlikely PI, but this quirky book has such charm that I hope to find the sequel soon.	2005-09-13

As a new bride and an inexperienced wife of a garrison Commander, she feels the loneliness and the uncertainties very deeply, and is sustained only by the deep love she feels for her taciturn and undemonstrative husband. Many centuries later, a former top model and acknowledged beauty, Miranda, becomes the third wife of Lord Freddie Stratton, a man who is many years her senior but who loves her deeply. Their magnificent house, Ladycross, is centuries old and is built on the exact position of the Ladycross which was built by Publius and Claudia, and is the venue of an annual, world famous Rock concert. A close neighbour,Bobbie Govan, is a former schoolmate of Miranda and moves into a small cottage on the Ladycross estate.There are three separate love stories happening simultaneously...Claudia in the 2nd century, Miranda in the present day and Bobbie, also in the present day but whose love story is more with her newly found daughter and grandson.

She is virtually told to keep her imagination in check and to just attend to her own job. At the same time, Laurie is trying to convince her less than enthusiastic lover that it's time for marriage and children, but Jack is still fearful of making a commitment, with the memory of the hurt he suffered when his family was destroyed, holding him back. The really alarming premise made in this story is that the huge health insurance company which has taken over two of the city's major hospitals, has found a way to use the most up to date DNA information to weed out insurees who have the DNA marker for illnesses which would be costly to correct and treat, so consequently, they are being disposed of before the illnesses actually surface. It's a long bow to draw but one which is enough to put shivers up the spines of anyone about to be hospitalised. It's an exciting but ultimately chilling read.	2005-09-06

It starts as a fairly simple tale, the story of how two families with young daughters of the same age, come together and become firm friends. When one set of parents is killed by a V2 rocket at the end of WW2, the orphaned girl is immediately absorbed into the other family. The years which follow as the girls grow into womanhood, are filled by tragedy after tragedy, with death, betrayal, cruelty and a couple of bad marriages thrown in. There are so many characters introduced that I felt that this could have been the script for a long running soap on TV, and the story becomes bitsy and leaves the reader exhausted with trying to keep up. Even years later, things are still unresolved and, although real life doesn't always work out neatly, I'd still rather that my stories did, preferably with a happy ending.	2005-08-31

A constant irritant to Tess is an abrasive, ambitious reporter on the paper, Rosita Ruiz, a Latina who doesn't hesitate to use chequebook journalism or to invent stories to suit her own agenda. When Rosita also commits suicide after being fired, Tess is convinced that both Wink and Rosita have been murdered and sets out to prove just that. The story is just a little too bitsy for me, but there are some great characters being established who will, presumably, continue into further books.	2005-08-30

Books	4	4	4	N	N	Thought provoking	When I first realised that this book was centered on a group of women connected to a cancer clinic, in a hospital in a small town, my first reaction was one of dismay, thinking that it was going to be a totally depressing read, and wondering whether or not to continue. I'm so glad that I did as it's nothing like that at all. The women concerned are recovering patients, a doctor, a \\"Friend\\", one of the volunteers who help patients in a hospital, and their families. They are fairly normal, ordinary people who, on the surface, appear to be leading ordinary lives, but, beneath the surface of their facade, are seething, roiling hotbeds of fear, anger and frustration, just just awaiting release. It's a well written, thought provoking book which deserves to be read by anyone with a friend or relative who has been touched by serious illness, even if it appears that they are coping well, and isn't a bit depressing or maudlin.	2005-08-28

Graham Marshall is a plodder who has worked his way up the ladder in the place where he works, to be assistant head of his department. Life with his shallow wife, who is becoming more like her ex-celebrity, whining mother, and his two teenaged children with whom he has never bonded, seems to be all that he may expect for the future until that horrifying day that he finds himself passed over at work, in a shake-up of employees. He has overpent on a large, old house in the expectation of a better salary as department head, so that when the job fails to materialise, his pleas that his wife curbs her spending, are totally ignored and drives Graham to a state of pure hatred for her. He now realises that he would be in a much better position financially if he could think of a believable way to kill her and to collect her large insurance policy. He works out an ingenious plan and likes the feeling of power so much that he goes on to plot another murder. It's a fascinating look into the mind of a serial killer and, as the photo on the front cover of the book shows, it was made into a movie starring Michael Caine in the leading role. I can picture, exactly, that cold, dead-pan look he portrays so well and look forward to finding a copy of the movie.	2005-08-27

She had always intended to follow in Mac's footsteps by following him into politics, but was strenuously dissuaded by her husband, Adam Cauliffe, an up and coming architect. Adam had called a conference meeting of several of his business associates on his boat, but when it was blown to pieces, shortly after setting out, the subsequent investigations open a whole can of worms, involving all of the people on board in questionable building practices and extortion. Nell's aunt, an old lady who has a deep interest in the psychic world, urges her to visit her pet medium, in an attempt to contact Adam. Nell reluctantly agrees, only because she and Adam had argued on the previous night and she felt guilty that he had died before their harsh words could be taken back. It's an interesting read with touches of other-worldliness about it and a frightening look into the world of huge building projects, with possibly shonky, cost cutting elements which could prove disastrous.	2005-08-25

Elvis is engaged by a wealthy businessman to recover a valuable, old Japanese book which was stolen from his house. Elvis and his muscular side kick, Joe Pike, both Vietnam vets, become embroiled in a series of violent events which are centered in Little Tokyo, the Japanese section of LA.When the businessman's daughter is kidnapped, Elvis is summarily fired but continues to look for the girl as he had promised to look after her and feels a sense of guilt about this lonely, strange girl. He locates her in a commune for homeless teenagers, led by a formerly famous martial arts hero who wants the world to live by the standards of the Japanese code of honour, Bushido. Things go from bad to worse for Elvis and Joe, resulting in a shootout and a very violent martial arts fight to the death. I liked the story, especially the sassy way Elvis deals with danger, but was saddened by the plight of the children of the rich and famous who seem to be lost souls, for all their affluence.	2005-08-22

She sub lets her London flat and settles into a tiny cottage in the country town where her distant cousin, Charles Stanza is presently running the antiques auction house with the aid of his horsey, dominating fiancee, Annabella. They, naturally, resent her being there, and do everything to convince her to sell her shares to them and move back to London. Flora takes to the trade at once and is determined to put up with any inconvenience to prove herself. There are lots of references to the TV shows, Antiques Roadshow and Bargain Hunt and to the real grinding slog of house clearing, including the disgusting filth of some of the premises that auctioneering firms have to endure. It's a chick lit book, light and amusing...lovely for an in-between read and I knew that I loved the author when I read her bio at the beginning of the book....\\"The authors' hobbies are housework and ironing, but, unfortunately, she doesn't have much time for either as she feels it her duty to keep a close eye on the afternoon chat shows!\\"	2005-08-21

Aristocratic Kit Dysart is loved by two women, one being the upper class but penniless Daisy..beautiful but self willed and dangerously feckless, and the other, her cousin Mattie, rather plain, sickly and orphaned, but enormously wealthy. Kits' family fortunes have been badly eroded, shockingly mishandled by his stubborn, irascible father who returned from the battle fields of France after WW1, a broken and bitter man. Lack of money forces Kit to ignore his passion for Daisy and to accept Mattys' proposal of marriage, so even though the marriage is one of convenience, the fortune she brings with her restores the family home and standing. The story isn't as plebian as perhaps I've painted it as it is peopled by diverse charcters, broken ex-soldiers with broken spirits, and a new class emerging in this restless time between the wars. Elizabeth Buchan writes beautifully with an underlying tinge of melancholy which fits the feeling of the moment...a feeling of impermanence and shadows.	2005-08-20

Tess Monahan is an ex-reporter who was dumped from her job when the newspaper she was working for went under and she was made redundant. For two years she has struggled to make ends meet by working part time at her aunts' book shop, scratching at the irritation of her boredom by rowing, her exercise of choice. Her rowing buddy, Rock, asks her to follow his girl friend Ava, who is behaving strangely, and to find out whether or not she is seeing someone else. Ava has several meetings with notorious lawyer, Michael Abramowich and when the lawyer is murdered, the blame falls immediately on Rock. Tess now begins to raelise her true vocation and future livelihood is that of being an investigator for a legal firm, and embarks on an involved course of action to clear Rocks' name. There's plenty of action and many twists and turns in this novel and, of course, I can't wait to get the next in the series.	2005-08-17

It's an interconnecting story of three debutantes, young ladies who are being presented to polite society at the turn of the 19th century. It's a fascinating observance of the mores and morals of English society at that time, with its strict obsrvances of the codes of etiquette, without which, anyone not quite up to scratch, could be easily weeded out. The author has gone into great detail about the clothing worn by the three girls and their chaperones, and I must say that I found it incredible that ladies of that time, were dressed from head to toe by their maids, including their most intimate apparel, and were virtually incapable of dressing themselves. It's a good story with revenge, deceit and plain old lust rearing their heads, and would certainly recommend this book to any lover of historical or Edith Wharton type historical tales.	2005-08-15

Set in Palm Beach, Florida, Archie is employed by his fathers' law firm to investigate the troubles suffered by the firms' clients in a completely discreet fashion, and to find a way around those troubles without scandal or the need to call in the police. Mrs. Edythe Westmore is a wealthy but rather stupid client of the McNally law firm who is being gulled into the purchase of a Faberge Imperial egg, at the cost of half a million dollars, by a couple of smooth crooks. Her son and daughter are furious at what they consider to be the wasting of their inheritances and beg Archie to help them to expose the financial advisors who are urging their mother to invest with them. For all his foppish ways, Archie isn't quite as wet as everyone believes, and does a creditable job in foiling con men and thugs alike. To me, he seems like a cross between the Scarlet Pimpernel and Dashiell Hammetts' \\"Thin Man\\". It's light, amusing fluff with mouth watering descriptions of food, expensive cars and Archies' eclectic taste in dashing clothes...a good, light, fun read.	2005-08-10

Angel, aka Fitzroy Maclean Angel, university graduate, cheerful boozer and avid womaniser, is flat sitting for his landlord when the body of an old university friend falls through the bathroom skylight and into the bathtub with a large section of window glass fatally imbedded in his neck. The police deduce that he was trying to escape from a group of violent animal activists with whom he had previously been involved. Angel is persuaded by the police to join the group as an unofficial undercover agent to discover the source of their weapons and to be able to warn the police about the extent of their escalating use of explosives.The scene is set in the countryside with a radical vicar, the hunting set, a vodka swilling teenager and exciting chases in Angels' old London taxicab. He's such a likeable villain that he keeps you smiling all through the book with his amusing dialogue and general good humour.	2005-08-09

The first comment that I must make on this book is that one of the lines on the back cover by \\"Booklist\\" review, is the most spot on that I've ever seen. It says \\" Like reading Thackeray edited by Elmore Leonard\\" and that statement is exactly right...wish I'd thought of it! In Victorian London, former Superintendent Thomas Pitt has now been seconded to the Special Branch, to deal with the growing threat of anarchy. It's a sideways move for him as he has run foul of the corrupt Inspector Wetron of Bow Street. For the most part, the anarchists are well meaning but misguided young men who are convinced that all authority is corrupt, especially that of the police. They are encouraged in these beliefs by unscrupulous officials who are seeking to feather their own nests and to follow their own agendas by urging these poor, deluded young men to acts of violence and public terror. Pitt and his old adversary, Sir Charles Voisey, call a temporary truce to get to the centre of the ring of corrupt police, who are financing their terrorist attacks. The story bears a frightening similarity to todays' state of alarm (not with any polce connection), and is a grippeing and absorbing read.	2005-08-07

When Sarah Merritts' father dies, she travels to Deadwood, Dakota for two reasons, firstly to locate her sister Addie,who, she believes, is working as a domestic in a boarding house, and secondly, to set up a newspaper with her fathers' old printing press. She soon finds Addie who is working as a prostitute, a\\"soiled dove\\" as the local townspeople call them, and also falls foul of the local Marshall, Noah Campbell, who throws her in jail. The chemistry between Sarah and Noah is immediate but manifests itself as animosity for a few months until they sort out their feelings. Addies' old beau is summoned to town by Sarah, to whisk her away from her sordid occupation and, eventually, after a lot of misunderstandings and soul searching, harmony develops, along with the raw town which begins to become domesticated. It's not my usual genre of reading but was an enjoyable, light change and great fun, as I could visualise each scene with the appropriate actors from the 50's in the roles, and even hear Doris Days' voice singing \\"The Deadwood Stage\\".	2005-08-05

The local police chief, Ruben Martinez, is expected to find the culprit without too much difficulty, but when the investigation is under way for 3 months without a result, he and Detective Ginger Earley come under severe criticism from the council and townspeople. The two have recently formed a romantic relationship and are working slowly but steadily through possible clues when Ginger is made aware that Taras' history teacher at the local high school, Jerry Frankel, was released from his prior teaching position after being accused, but not prosecuted, of a relationship with a teenaged girl. When the town learns that Frankel is being questioned, a wave of anti semitism sweeps through the community, with so called devout churchgoers writing hateful letters to the newspaper, and avowed, upright Christians letting their fears blind them to their own bigotry. I found this to be a frightening read as it shows just how quickly the veneer of normalcy can be stripped away, exposing human prejudices to be so near the surface, and how hatreds born out of fear and ignorance can take over a seemingly civilized community.	2005-08-02

DS Duncan Kincaid is called in to represent Scotland Yard in a murder/arson investigation of the burning of a warehouse owned by a prominent MP. It's an investigation that he could well do without at this minute as he is concerned about a hearing affecting the custody of his son. His partner and lover, DI. Gemma James, is not prepared to commit to marriage, even though the even tenor of their lives with their joined families is in jeopardy. After the charred body of a female is discovered in the aftermath of the warehouse fire, patient and detailed police work unravels the identity of the victim who is linked to the murder and disappearance of several women from the same district. Dr. Tony Kovak arranges for a casual friend to help kidnap his 10 year old daughter so as to prevent her mother from stopping custody arrangements, but doesn't bargain for his daughters' total disappearance. Yet another woman can't be located and is found murdered. It's a gripping, methodical plot and one which I would recommend to every reader who enjoys this style of mystery.	2005-07-30

Frank Elder is a retired Detective Inspector, living a lonely, solitary life in Cornwall. His wife has divorced him  and remarried, and his teenaged daughter is still bitterly resentful that, through his work connections, she was abducted and raped. When forty something Detective Sergeant Maddy Birch is raped and murdered, Frank is drawn back to the force on a temporary basis as he and Maddy had once worked together and shared a tiny moment. The author draws a very skilful plot with two suspects vying for the role of Maddys' murderer at the same time and more than a hint of some very nasty police corruption.

Jess Koster is a very troubled and flawed woman, rather unlikeable most of the time, with her arrogant views and prickly nature, but a very competent lawyer and States' attorney. Against her parents' wishes, she married her law tutor,Don, eleven years her senior, while still in law school and, even after the marriage had finished, stayed under his influence and protection. She meets an attractive shoe salesman who seems to be working at a job which is way below his mental and social capacities,and, for the first time in years, thinks that a romance might be possible. A client of Jess has been raped and terrorised by a sadistic monster, Rick Ferguson, but is convinced by Jess to testify against him in spite of repeated threats to her life. When her client is found, beaten and nearly decapitated, Jess faces her ex-husband across the courtroom where he is defending Ferguson, and so begins an horrific time for Jess, with Ferguson stalking her and horrible incidents becoming a daily part of her life.

When a tall, handsome Irish stranger rides into town, she is swept off her feet romantically and begins a red hot affair with him. The main body of the story consists of murder, threats, espionage and all the usual everyday stuff, but what soured it for me was the sheer stupidity of Sky, a supposedly intelligent and beautiful girl in her thirties, who blurts out whatever comes into her mind without thinking of the consequences, and who just made me want to shake her and tell her to grow up!	2005-07-19

It consists of very short chapters, each on a different subject, but most of which are concerned with bodily functions. If you are fascinated by reading chapters on urinating (and why men have wet spots on the front of their trousers), pooing, farting, masturbating and all the other usually private functions, then this is your kind of book. On the other hand, if, like me, you prefer to read something a bit more entertaining, don't bother with this book. Ok, perhaps I'm old fashioned, but there are some things that I'd rather keep private and don't find any humour in the kind of wee and poo jokes that traditionally have 5 year old boys rolling in the aisles.	2005-07-12

Apart from the sheer magnificence of the stones and the settings, the provenance of the pieces and just how they happened to be in the possession of the various members of the royal family, is completely fascinating. It's also a very interesting look at the social mores of the various eras. In Queen Victoria's time, she tended to wear more modest jewellery, much of which had a sentimental value to her, and so the ladies of the day tended to follow her example. In the following reign, that of Edward V11, the upper classes of the day followed the example of Queen Alexandra, who was a beauty and who dressed lavishly in her own particular style, which was followed by ladies of the court and which featured high necklines, decorated heavily with diamonds and precious stones. In the following reign of a very rigid George V and Queen Mary, the court seemed to be bolstering the idea of an unapproachable royalty, above the touch of scandal and to foster this idea by literally covering the Queen in jewels from head to toe. Today's monarch jewels up only on the most formal of occasions, but it's thanks to her and to the Queens of the past that this amazing collection has been built up over the years to amaze and bedazzle lovers of beautiful jewellery everywhere.	2005-06-29

When Joanne Hunters husband tells her that he wants a break from marriage after 20 years, this almost perfect Stepford Wife stereotype, falls to pieces in disbelief...perfect housekeeping, perfect meals, caring only for him and the two girls..what could possibly be wrong? To add to her worries, her elder daughter develops a rebellious streak, her next dood neighbour and oldest friend Eve, is continoually complaining of illness which cannot be diagnosed, and her beloved grandfather who is in a nursing home, is descending into total senility. At about this time, she starts to recieve threatening phone calls, telling her that she's to be a murder victim, but recieves only token attention from police and friends. Joy Fielding has the ability to build up great tension without going over the top and I's recommend this book to any readers who love a bit of psycho drama.	2005-06-29

Moonspenders is the name given by the antiques trade to unscrupulous dealers who go on to other peoples properties by night, to locate buried metal antiquities with a metal detector, so when a friend of Lovejoy is found murdered in a field, supposedly gored by a bull, the picture just doesn't make sense to Lovejoy who starts to piece together his own scenario. Throw in a coven of witches, a very rich batty collector, a greedy land developer AND local thugs with murderous intent, and you have another typical Lovejoy adventure, light, amusing and with enough bits about the antique trade to make it more palatable. It's not the best in the series but a good, quick read.	2005-06-27

He'd respected her virtue before marriage, saying that he wanted to keep her until they were legally wed, but on the wedding night, and on all the nights that followed, he showed himself to be a warped man who could only perform sexually if the woman was humiliated in front of him by being stripped naked and bedecked with his famous Diamond Waterfall necklace and dozens of other pieces of jewellery. He then proceeded to rape, using the metal and stones of the settings to cut and bruise the flesh. Their marriage was regarded publicly as successful but, as with other women of this era, Lily had no option but to keep up a good front and to pretend that nothing was wrong. This story spans three generations of the Firth family from late in the 19th century and through two world wars, ending in 1947. It's a fascinating glimpse into the morals and mores of these eras, with the odd illegitimate child, brutal husbands,  less than perfect wives and travels from England to Rumania, France and Italy. The horrors of war and its aftermaths are well covered and make for graphic if not pleasant reading. It's a meaty read, not brain taxing but full of good, gossipy bits.	2005-06-26

Children as young as eight years of age are supposed to be strong enough by that age to toss the shuttles from one side of the loom to the other, for their parents, and have v irtually no childhood, except that which is associated with poverty, disease, near starvation and perpetual tiredness.The Himley family struggles to keep alive with the father drowning his sorrows in drink, with money which should be spent on food. The eldest daughter Bessie is raped by one of the weavers at the factory and runs away with her elder brother, to escape the fate which she knows awaits her if she remains at home. Like many another girl in her village, she knows that with the rapes becoming part of life, it is only a matter of time before she becomes pregnant and loses all chance of a better life. When the innocent and ignorant pair arrive in London, they almost immediately fall victims to con artists, lose their small cache of money and have to begin a new life with Bessie becoming a reluctant prostitute. Happy endings do ultimately occur, but I can't imagine why anyone would really enjoy reading this depressing kind of book, even with a happy ending.	2005-06-23

At times, some passages seem to be too wordy and a bit contrived, but over all, the writing is as smooth as silk, as once the reader has accepted the flow, the eyes just skim over the pages. Aldred Leith is attached to the Army of Occupation in Japan and has been commissioned to write a detailed account on the effects of this war on the occupants of China and Japan. In the mountains of Kure, he is billeted with a military group, headed by a blustering, obnoxious, Australian Colonel and his wife who are the unlikely parents of a talented but dying son and his equally charming sibling, a seventeen year old girl with whom Leith falls instantly in love. Realising the unsuitability of a man of 31 having anything to do with such a young girl, he waits for a year to approach her with anything other than an avuncular friendliness, to find that his feelings have been returned for all of that time. There is a mystical quality to this book, and, without wishing to appear snobbish or biased, I feel that this is a book for Readers.	2005-06-22

She has no idea who this woman is or why her father was so insistent and so, ignoring her husbands petulant demands that she devote herself to his needs only, she visits her in the nursing home. Sarah Tolley is in the early stages of Alzheimers and, while being unable to cope with everyday things, has total recall of all the horrific events which happened to her in the Fifties. She was a pyschiatric nurse, working in a hospital where new methods of dealing with mentally ill patients were being tried, and where patients were subjected to the most horrific drugs and brain washing techniques. Laura has a five year old daughter Emma who was the result of a one night affair with a man whom she hasn't seen since then, so when a much older male friend offers to marry her, she accepts to give her child a father. Lauras husband Ray is a chronically depressed individual who suicides in view of Emma who becomes mute as a result of the shock and when a therapist suggests that Laura contacts Emmas birth father to try to help the situation, their love story begins. Lauras and Sarahs stories intertwine so much that we are watching two stories simultaneously. The love stories are well done but I must admit to finding the treatment of the mental patients distressing in the extreme and while not doubting that these practices took place, some of them even government sponsored, I found them to be unpleasant reading which left me shaken.	2005-06-18

A wealthy but reclusive family, parents, three sons and a daughter, has been brutally slaughtered in their summer home in northern Michigan, with curtains closed and doors locked, so that their bodies are not discovered for several weeks. The scene is one of unbelievable carnage, with the mother and little girl raped as well as murdered. Sheriff Hugh deWitt is the towns' second generation police chief, a conscientious but depressed man who has never fully recovered from the SIDS death of his son and who is not mentally prepared to confront the horror of this situation. M/s Guest's writing style is fluid but not flowery and her use of short, sharp chapters helps the flow of the story, making it a smooth, quick read. She uses a number of red herrings in the form of locals with agendas which tie them into the crime scene and throws in a few local characters for slight comic relief, admitting that she based this book on a true story which happened two decades previously and is unsolved to this day. I'd unhesitatingly recommend the work of Judith Guest to any reader of this genre.	2005-06-17

Kelly is a soap opera star who plays the role of a malicious and bitchy advice columnist on a popular day time TV show. After a series of near fatal accidents happen to her, the backers of the show decide that she should be given a leave of absence, just in case something happens to her which would be to the detriment of the show. Her agent books her to appear in a rock video where she is to play the part of a tango dancer, and hires a dance teacher/bodyguard to stay close to her at all times while teaching her the rudiments of the dance. Several more incidents occur during rehearsals and, instead of being grateful to her guardian who is repeatedly warning her to take commonsense measures to ensure her safety, this stupid airhead takes offence at his warnings and flouces off in a pet. I found this character to be not only incredibly stupid, but irritating in the extreme and in dire need of a good slap around the legs!	2005-06-16

Her dearest friend and old college mate Sarah, is dying and wishes to see Maxie once again to give her some final instructions as her executor. Maxie arrives just too late however, to find that Sarah has been murdered in the local hospital without making it clear why she so urgently wanted to speak to Maxie. Sarah's house has been torn apart by someone searching for documentation and Maxie is confronted rudely by Alan, Sarah's adopted son, who is bitter and resentful that his mother would choose to have an old friend as executor, rather than him. While driving through the mountains with Ed, another old college friend of Maxie and Sarah, they are almost run off the road by someone intent on doing them harm, and later, Maxie is threatened by an intruder who leaves frightening notes, threatening her life. It's very refreshing to have as the heroine of this book, a feisty 60 something widow who doesn't hesitate to bring out the shotgun in her defence and who proves that not all senior citizens are either senile or too timid to live alone, travel and lead interesting lives. I look forward to further adventures with Maxie and Stretch.	2005-06-15

Jim Bennett is a young Wall St. wiz kid who has been chosen by the President of the US to be a major part of his peace making deal between the Israeli and Arab worlds. Jim, who is bent on becoming a multi millionaire as fast as possible, reluctantly agrees to be part of the team following an attempt to assassinate the President and after undergoing a test of his loyalty in a way that is almost sadistic. He and an attractive female secret agant are sent to Israel where they tie up with Mossad, the Israeli secret service. The forces of Saddam Hussein are on the brink of starting a nuclear war and have the intention of wiping out any city which is anti Saddam, beginning with the Queen of England, the US president and the Joranian royal family. The counter attacks by the Israelis and the forces of the US are swift and terrible and the really frightening thing is that this is not just a novelist's dream but a quite possible scenario given the state of the world of today.	2005-06-12

This book is about one man's love and respect for Diana, beautiful, capricious and loving as she undoubtedly was, and flawed, as we all are. Reading between the lines of this entertaining and informative book, I cannot but feel that this man was set up by some members of the royal family and abetted by members of her own family, to paint him in the worst light possible, as a thief and a traitor to her memory. I was fascinated by details at life at the VERY top, and by just how fleeting love and loyalty can be when one has to take sides. OK, so she was a bit ratty but with the treatment she got, who can blame her! If you read only one book about her personal life, this would be the one.	2005-06-08

When she meets another successful businessman, Chance Stuart at a social function, bells start to ring for both of them and they begin a torrid love affair. Chance is the presumed heir to a large ranch in Oklahoma, owned and run by his Aunt Hattie, an embittered old maid who hates the thought that, because of the wording of the family will, the ranch must pass to a blood relative. Chance is the son of her sister who married a man way beneath her socially, and because of this, Chance has always been the despised heir, even though he has become one of the top businessmen in the state. Chance has been secretly making plans for the day when he inherits the ranch, when he plans to flood the valley and house, turning it into a vast holiday complex. Flame and Chance marry after knowing each other for only a few weeks and it is only then that Chance realises that Flame has more claim to the ranch than he has. When Hattie discovers Flame's whereabouts, she poisons her mind with doubts and suspicions about Chance's true motive in marrying her. The plot thickens with many more dramas as befits a story with the principals named Flame and Chance, but it was a good, if guilty read!	2005-06-07

The extreme heat and humidity saps his strength so badly that he doesn't even make it out of the terminal of the airport, but collapses in a heap for a quick nap on the floor of the terminal. Big mistake...when he awakens to find his money and passport missing, he makes the long walk into the city and throws himself on the mercy of a man who had given him his card on the plane. The man rejects his plea for charity and walks away, only to be stabbed to death a few minutes later. After finding himself temporary shelter with a friendly expat, Lovejoy hawks his talents as an expert in antiques and antique reproductions, and is contacted by the Triads and forced into working for them. His room mate works as a gigolo, servicing travelling ladies with dinner, dancing and anything else they might require, and recruits Lovejoy into the profession. He is fascinated by Jade Woman, a beautiful and highly educated young woman, trained since childhood to be the face of the Triads. Lovejoy makes a deal with the gangs to forge pieces of art for them and soon finds himself in big trouble as usual.

The book describes magnificent scenery in France and in Paris itself, but is mainly concerned with steamy sex scenes on floors, couches, beds and almost antwhere else convenient.

Poor foolish Helen had never grown out of loving the man who deserted her years before and was still so in thrall to him that she left her husband and children with barely a qualm. The main body of the story is the rites of passage of her children through their childhood and teenaged years, and that of Helen and her life with the charming but feckless Louis who dominated her world for the rest of her life.

In the first book, State Attorney CJ Townsend sends a totally vile mass murderer and torturer, William Bantling, to prison to await his proscribed death sentence. Unfortunately for her, Bantling's arrest was dependent on a not completely lawful car search, and even though there is no doubt that he is guilty, the unlawful stopping of his car could wreck the prosecutions defence. In this follow up book, CJ is having trouble reconciling her conscience with the knowledge that the search was illegal, and with not being able to confide her fears to her lover. The only other people who had first hand knowledge of the unlawful capture of this dangerous murderer are the police involved and when, over a short period, each of them is killed in a sickening fashion, she realises that she is probably next on the list, even though Bantling is still safely behind bars. It's a book that you CANNOT put down, so be prepared to read into the small hours.	2005-05-29

When the body of the baby is found, four days later, the trail eventually leads to the two girls. Alice always vehemently denies even being at the scene when the baby died, while Ronnie admits killing the infant. As they are both only 11 years old at the time, they aren't tried as adults but are sent to separate juvenile prisons until they are 18. Shortly  after their release, two tiny children are abducted, only to be released, unharmed, a short while later. A third child disappears but this time, she is found to bear a striking resemblance to the child who was murdered seven years previously. As the police question Alice and Ronnie who have lead separate lives since being back home with their families, secrets slowly begin to unravel and a whole new scenario unfolds.

Sarah Harrison is a superb writer who weaves her story with touches of mysticism interlaced with hard, cold truths. Apollonia Durrance, known as Api, is the youngest child of singularly unconcerned parents who go their own way, not through cruelty but from sheer apathy and indifference to the fate of their offspring. Api survives a horrifying episode with a control freak when she is just a teenager, only to fall hopelessly in love with a man whom she meets just once for a few seconds. Bryn Mancini is a hugely successful architect, married to a beautiful and talented wife and their life together is storybook perfect. The catalyst which brings Bryn and Api into the same sphere is a large, sinister painting of Api's great grandfather, a man whose past is shrouded in mystery but whose shaded face haunts Api's dreams. It's an absolute cracker of a book which I would recommend to anyone.	2005-05-22

The body of a beautiful young man is discovered, lying in filth, in a secret apartment concealed within a normal house in Istanbul. Neighbours claim to have seen a well dressed Armenian man entering and leaving the house at intervals, but none has any knowledge of the dead youth. Inspector Ikmen of the Turkish police and his close friend, Armenian forensic pathologist,Arto Sarkissian, join forces to try to identify the body and to investigate the case. Barbara Nadel's books featuring these two men cover a lot of territory involving both Turkish and Armenian culture and history and perhaps would be better appreciated by a reader with more knowledge of the two cultures. As the plot evolves, we are drawn into a murky world of male prostitution and drug usage which made me feel rather grimy and even the hard drinking, chain smoking Inspector has personal issues which go back into the old culture of the Ottoman upper classes.

Eve's subsequent suicide preys on Dolly's conscience,causing her to devote much of her life to the care of Eve's two daughters, Annie and Laurel. The major part of the book belongs to the lives and careers of the two girls, with Annie intent on becoming one of the great chocolatiers of the time and Laurel pursuing a career in art. It's an involved story with some pretty steamy love scenes and characters falling in and out of love. It actually would make a great soapie with villains and heroes, breaking hearts and heroines and the most mouth watering descriptions of fine chocolate making that can be imagined.

Bethany's boyfriend, Ridge Standingdeer, a young Cherokee who is a member of a mystical section of the tribe called Ani Zaguhi, has hidden tapes made by Bethany as she was being molested, and when Bethany is brutally murdered,Deke encourages the police to arrest Ridge, calling him a witch and inciting the locals to villify him, using racial prejudice to urge them on. Mary agrees to act as defence lawyer for Ridge and with the unsought help of Kayla and Avis who is about to become Deke's next victim, works to unmask him and to reveal him as an unspeakable criminal. Although pedophilia and racial abuse are not pleasant subjects, Sallie Bissell writes a very readable story and I feel that more to come, featuring Mary Crowe in her new role as a defence attorney.	2005-05-07

The McNallys use their own branch of investigation, a service called Discreet Enquiries, which is run by the junior McNally, to ferret out information without anyone being aware that such sordid goings on are taking place. At the same time, Palm Beach society is rocked to hear that one of the town's leading lights, Melva Williams, had admitted to killing her husband, claiming that she found him in a most compromising situation with a young woman, causing her to snap and shoot him dead. Tne urbane and witty Archy McNally, head of Discreet Enquiries, agrees to take Melva's daughter under the protection of his family when Melva is charged and taken into custody. There are many twists and turns during this story which is really rather light in tone and full of references to fine clothes, wines and food and the good things in life which the very wealthy can afford.It reminded me of the old Thin Man movies, with the hero portrayed as a witty man of the world with a Scarlet Pimpernel approach, letting himself be seen as a bit of a fop who is only interested in his stylish clothes and racy cars. Other reviewers have criticised this work as not being up to the standard of earlier books in the series but, as this is the first I have read, I thoroughly enjoyed it as a respite from the more graphic and dark murder mysteries that I've read recently.	2005-05-01

Nora had previously been married to Tom, a cardiologist who died unexpectedly, leaving her comfortably off. FBI agent John O'Hara goes undercover as an insurance salesman to meet Nora and to gain her trust, but finds himself becoming sexually attracted to her, causing him to doubt his initial feelings of mistrust. In another state, Nora has yet another husband, a hugely successful writer of historical fiction whom she is plotting to bump off after having cleared out his bank accounts. Nora is a very busy little poisoner, with lovers dropping like flies and with her Swiss bank accounts filling nicely. To add yet more spice to the plot, Nora's mother is incarcerated in a psychiatric institution, having been committed for the murder of her husband. It's a quick read with a good pace...not brilliant but entertaining.	2005-05-01

An angst ridden detective, Dennis Murchison is given the case to investigate and becomes involved in a world of drug dealers, arsonists and psychos. I couldn't really empathise with anyone in this book which probably explains why I just didn't like it !	2005-04-27

When Catherine was a child, she was abducted, held in the dark in an underground prison and sexually molested for a month. After she escaped from her tormentor, who was jailed for 25 years, she appeared to have made a good recovery but secretly continued in her role as an abused victim. She married the son of a prominent and very powerful judge who didn't approve of the marriage and who encouraged his son to beat and torment his wife and young son. State Trooper Bobby Dodge is a member of the local SWAT team, trained to evaluate hostage situations and react accordingly, so when he is called upon to shoot dead Catherine's abusive husband who was holding her at gunpoint, he is astonished to find that the judge  is bringing a civil case of murder against him. Meanwhile, the judge has also used his authority to obtain the release of Catherine's kidnapper, the psycopathic killer and torturer, and uses him to try to gain custody of his grandson. It's a pacy and exciting book which moves so quickly that you've finished it sooner than you'd wish...a great read!	2005-04-25

Josh is given a cover story by an elderly female friend of Beth and, with his son accompanying him, moves in with the old lady as her supposed grandson. Young disguises himself and stalks Beth, plotting to hurt her as much as possible by destroying her friends before killing her. It's a real nail biter and a story that I couldn't put down.	2005-04-20

She is tentatively accepted as a gang member, allowed to take part in the scams but closely watched at all times.

He risks life and limb to get out to the fort which is several miles out to sea, and discovers the hiding place to be a repository for stolen antiques.

The gilt wears off the gingerbread after 8 months and poor stupid Edith does everything she can to win back the trust of her husband. The story of a certain type of hangers-on who live in the shadow of the truly uppercrust is bitingly spot-on and the efforts that they go to in an effort to be included with that set is really pathetically accurate.

She lives modestly in an apartment block peopled by diverse Village characters, and numbers among her friends, people as varied as a president of a major corporation to a forger of well known paintings. Several plots unfold, improbable as they seem in such an innocuous setting--a young girl who is trying to hide a large amount of cash, the proceeds of a robbery, a man who confides in Nellie that he committed murder some years ago and Nellie herself, trying to spark a romance between a beautiful ex-model and her nephew. Her brutal murder stuns everybody as such a crime seems pointless. Her nephew, a well known photographer, begins to investigate her death and slowly a picture starts to form, incriminating friends who have no apparent reason to do her harm.

Her attitude to Jack and the children becomes strangely out of character and when he is invited to join her firm in a laboratory in the Nevada desert, she is involved in a car crash and put out of action temporarily. The firm is involved with creating a state of artificial life in the form of nanoparticles, micro robots which are self reproducing through the consumption of the decaying flesh of humans and animals. The creatures swarm like bees, are intelligent, virtually alive and cannot be destroyed. While Jack is there at the laboratory, Ricky, the head of the project, directs the swarm to destroy some of the working scientists, who are killed and absorbed into the swarm. Julia reappears, totally in cahoots with Ricky and trying to kill her husband. This kind of futuristic sci-fi isn't my usual reading and frankly I find much of it terribly hard to understand.

Lord Curzon had married an American heiress who died young, leaving him with the care of their three daughters and access to their huge fortunes. The eldest Irene, never married and in her earlier years, devoted her time to fox hunting and charity works. After the death of her sister Cimmie, she took on the responsibility of raising her children. Cimmie married Tom Mosley, an ardent Fascist leader who was a fervent follower of Hitler, and shared her husbands passion for Fascism. The youngest, Baba, was a typical spoilt and supremely selfish heiress, with all the morals of a female dog on heat, even to the extent of sleeping with (among others)her brother in law. Baba was an intimate of the new King Edward 8th and Mrs. Simpson and was present at their wedding and at most of the goings on of the Cliveden set who represented the \\"in\\" crowd in London society at that time. It's a fascinating look at the social history of the 20's and 30's, warts and all, and a thoroughly enjoyable gossipy read.	2005-04-03

Michael Brock is a young lawyer with a prestigious firm in Washington, one of their top billers and well on his way to a highly lucrative partnership. Although the law firm pays well, it's at the expense of any personal life, as the younger lawyers are expected to put in 60 hour weeks, including weekends and to hell with the cost to their marriages. Michaels' wife is a surgeon who  is battling her own way up to the top, so, needless to say, their fairly new marriage is suffering very badly and is coming inexorably to a halt. A dirty, smelly homeless man locks a meeting of some of the main lawyers in the firm, into a conference room and threatens them with the dynamite which he has strapped to his body. He claims that he and a group of others were wrongfully evicted from their home in an old building and were literally thrown out into the street.A standoff is concluded with him being shot by a police sniper. Michael is  deeply moved by the homeless mans story and realises that his life is motivated by greed and ambition and determines to do everything he can to help the street people. He joins a small firm headed by a large black activist and begins his quest to uncover the loopholes which have allowed the big corporations to ruthlessly brush aside the real needs of the street people.

Evelyn was briefly married to Dougie, Miss Clarvoes' brother, before their marriage was annulled after a few days. The caller is someone who enjoys preying on peoples' weaknesses and who gets a thrill by terrifying them with vile, sexually oriented scenarios. Miss Clarvoes' mother asks an old family friend to investigate the calls and, in doing so, he stumbles on a set of circumstances that are so out of character with the people who are receiving the calls, that he is really alarmed.

Rumer and Zeb have been friends since early childhood, choosing to spend their time together almost exclusively, up to the time when their close friendship begins to blossom into love, innocent and untarnished. They live in a tiny community on the Connecticut shoreline, where their families have lived for generations, next door to each other. Rumers' older sister Elizabeth, a beautiful but always dissatisfied girl, grows jealous of the affection shown to each other by the teenagers, and seduces Zeb, trapping him into a loveless marriage where the only saving grace is the birth of their son Michael. Zeb becomes an astronaut and Elizabeth an acclaimed actress, whose career could have gone further but for her drinking problem. Rumer becomes a vet and remains in her home town, tending to the local animals but never recovering from the heartache caused by Zebs' defection. On the eve of Michaels' 18th birthday, father and son return to the small town in an attempt at bonding as the ties between them have wavered since Zeb and Elizabeths' divorce.

When several members of a group of young \\"Goths\\" are  murdered in what appears to be  ritualistic rapes and murders. Police Inspectors Cetin Ikmen and Mehmet Suleyman are attached to the case with orders from on high to clean up the city as soon as possible. An English friend of both the men, Maximillian, seems to be deeply involved and, as he not only has connections to the murdered teenagers but is also a magician, steeped in the traditions of Kabbalah, an ancient Hebrew practice, he is immediately suspected of involvement with the killings. Obscene drawings have been plastered over the walls of local churches, mosques and temples, adding to the general fear that Satanism is being practiced and that the local young people are being drawn into a cult that is more dangerous than romantic. It's an unusual story from another culture and one which I found to be most interesting.	2005-03-19

A formerly well known sports star who is making a come back, is found, apparently murdered, with clues found leading to the arrest of Myrons' partner. Add some scenes with murderous transvestites creating havoc for Myron and his friends and the plot gets even more confusing. I'm sure that if you knew who the author was writing about, it would have been much more interesting so consequently can't give this book more than 3 stars.	2005-03-16

She joins forces with a former colleagus Emily Barlow, who has been recently promoted to the rank of Detective Chief Inspector, and whom Barbara admires greatly for her superior police work. <br />The body of a recent Pakhistani immigrant has been discovered on the beach and has been identified as the man brought to England as the prospective husband of the daughter of the towns' wealthiest businessman. The son of the businessman is intent on raising racial conflict in the town, leaving the police to wonder at his motives. <br />It's a good murder/mystery story with plenty of twists and turns and, although rather wordy, is nevertheless a good, long read.	2005-02-13

When a movie company decides to use the town as the setting for a movie and a musician named Big Bill moves into town, Lee and Fenny find themselves at odds for the first time as they both fall for the handsome and personable man, not realising that they both fancy him. <br />It's a pleasant read, full of amusing characters, a book to read when nothing too demanding is needed.	2005-02-09

As a female who is the same age as the heroine and who knew exactly what Gloria was talking about when she was describing clothes, customs and expectations of that era, I can empathise completely. Young women of today would probably find a lot of this story to be far fetched and totally unbelievable, but it really was like this. <br />The daughter of a wealthy upper middle class family, Gloria spent her junior and high school days in fear of \\"not fitting in\\", and trying to disguise her above average intelligence and academic aspirations, so as not to draw unwelcome attention from her peers. Having finished college with an excellent degree, she now intends to take her Masters at Columbia with a view to teaching poetry at college level.Her socialite mother is urging her to marry and to lead the \\"normal\\" life of the young American woman of the 50's, but although Gloria tries to conform, she finds her interim summer to be plagued with doubts about her whole life style.I would like to be able to read further into her future life to see what happens next.	2005-02-03

James Lee Burke has captured the heart and spirit of this area of New Iberia and New Orleans, perfectly...I was being driven, as a tourist, through these areas, these same streets, yesterday and am able to get the feeling of the locations as the author intended. <br />Detective Dave Robicheaux is assigned to act as bodyguard to the Governor elect Buford LaRose, and his attractive and sexy wife Karyn, with whom Dave had a brief fling before his marriage.  <br />Aaron Crown is a virtual Neanderthal of a man who has escaped from prison with a heart full of hatred for anyone in authority and a determination to hunt down and kill certain people who he feels are responsible for his imprisonment. The book is interspaced with all kinds of very dubious characters and crooked politicians, which initially slowed my reading down to a crawl in an effort to absorb just who these people were, but all became clear very soon after. Robicheaux fans will love this tale and perhaps Mr.Burke will gain some new fans with this fast moving story.	2005-02-03

Ellen finds a teaching job at the local school while also cleaning and cooking for her in-laws, a thoroughly nasty pair who find fault with everything she and her children do and who go out of their way to make them feel unwanted. <br />Margartet-Mary, her mother-in-law, is delighted to have her son back under her thumb and, under her influence, and that of her equally revolting husband, makes Ellens' and the childrens' lives a total misery, under the guise of their strict version of Catholic religion, a rigid faith full of subtle cruelties. In the beginning of the book, Ellens' husband seems to be a normal although weak man, but under the influence of his parents, he does the weak mans' trick of buckling under to make life easier for himself. Towards the end of the story, the reason for some of Margaret-Marys' bitterness is revealed but it still doesn't make her any more pleasant and it makes one wonder if her nastier traits (and those of her husband) were always present in James' character or are they only  b eing developed as his depression and his dependency on them grows?

She is commissioned to paint a family portrait by the towns' wealthiest woman, a recluse who fought her way to the top by selling vegetables from a push cart. <br />The whole story consists of snippets from both Lilys' family and that of her client, but it just doesn't jell properly and left me feeling dissatisfied and vaguely depressed.	2004-12-29

A mother and daughter are temporarily trapped by bad weather on a remote island off the Scottish coast and, to fill in the time, decide to tell stories of their lives. At this stage I thought that they were recounting real happenings about real people but, as time went on, I was no longer sure. Some of the characters are just too flaky to be convincing and on face value appear to be the grubbiest people on earth and with such bad diets that it's a wonder that they're not all suffering from scurvy! I also do like to feel an empathy with some of the characters in any book and in this, the only one I liked was a slightly batty old professor at the university where the daughter was half heartedly studying for a degree.

As the towns' economy depends on this factory, Abby's enquiries meet with downright resentment.Josh and a few other townspeople become dangerously violent and are showing signs of seizures which cause blinding headaches and even more violent behaviour.It all becomes rather exciting when Abby, with the help of the town renegade, visits the factory illicitly, making her way through secret underground passages and finding secret labotatories where scientists are working on antidotes for induced diseases, all in the name of research and supposedly with government approval.Abby manages to escape, up and down cliffs, over impossible terrains and fending off bullets, proving herelf to be the equal of any Wonderwoman(with a stray bullet in her leg AND being almost torn to pieces by falls from the cliff face) It's all a pretty good yarn but it's served as another reminder to me to stay away from hospitals at all cost!	2004-12-15

Elizabeth, a girl from Vermont, falls in love with Gerald, son of a Scottish college professor and his Chinese wife. Gerald never seems to be at all comfortable in his skin and seems to be constantly battling his two cultures. Elizabeth really forces marriage upon him, trying to overcome his initial reluctance with the strength of her love, and against the advice of her family, moves with him to Peking where they live happily and where their son Rennie is born. <br />When Communist forces begin the take over of China, Gerald sees no future for his wife and son under this regime and sends them back to America. It's really a sad book with Elizabeth never ceasing to miss Gerald and raising her son alone. M/s Bucks' prose is stilted in the extreme in this book and while this style reads well for conversation between Chinese people, I can't believe that any American woman would talk like this, even after spending 10 years in China.	2004-12-07

Johanna and her mother devise a plan which will be her only legal escape from the marriage..to convince a man to swear that he had married her, before her forced marriage to her sadistic husband. <br />By chance, a young man stumbles on to Johannas' parents land, supposedly a scholar but actually a soldier fighting on the opposite side to the current regime. In reurn for help for him and his wounded comrade, Gervase de Laval agrees to the scheme and goes through an examination by a church court which agrees to annul the marriage. Following this, Johanna returns to her parents' home while Gervase follows his feudal lord into battle against the Scots. Four years later, he returns and, after many arguments and much wrangling, the happy pair are reunited. <br />Personally, I would have loved to have given this shrewish girl a good slap around the legs to put an end to her incessant screeching and bad mouthing of everyone in sight.Yes, she WAS treated shamefully and most cruelly, but as she never ceased her persistant goading of Gervase and was always ready with sarcastic remarks that could be heard all over the castle, I just wonder that he didn't rise off into the sunset forever !	2004-12-05

She has been the protege of a former great actress, Constance Cameron, who had nurtured her talent and who had tried for years to foster a relationship with her equally talented grandson, Luke, a top Broadway producer. <br />After the accident, Jessica becomes a recluse on a small island off the US coast, ignoring all overtures from friends and show biz people to pick up the threads of her former life. Following the death of Constance, Luke discovers among her posssessions, a small chest, filled with years of letters from Jessica, and after reading them all, is drawn to the actress and determined to meet her. He tracks her down and, after an initially rocky start, they are so mutually attracted that they enjoy a week of sizzling romance which Luke is determined to continue. Jessica is still undecided about any future for them and, with a complete lack of confidence in her new, unglamorous appearance, bolts, literally hiding out in Sydney, Australia.She tentatively begins a career as a play director after meeting and befriending a dynamic woman who guides her to a new beginning in theatre. Of course, as in any good love story, she is pursued by letters and faxes from Luke and it's these communications between them, in wonderful prose, that form the basis of the ever growing understanding of each others deep seated fear of commitment but very real love and need. This will probably be classed as a \\"womans\\" book but I found it to be a great read and enjoyed every page.	2004-12-01

After a long and trying voyage, she is befriended by a sophisticated older Frenchwoman, who introduces her to a Japanese soldier, Count Kurihama.  <br />Her marriage is not successful and after giving birth to a daughter, she horrifies the community by having an affair with the Count. Her husband literally throws her out with no means of support and denies her any access to her daughter. When she becomes pregnant with the Counts' child, he sets her up in a modest house but only until the birth of her son. Very soon afterwards, the child is removed by his father and put out for adoption by a prestigious Japanese family who make him their heir. Poor, stupid Mary...dumped by her lover and discarded by her husband, begins to make a life for herself, realising that her future lies in Japan as she would be ostracised in the European world... talks her way into running a European dress salon within a large Japanese department store. She eventually forms her own retail company, designing clothes for the wives of wealthy men, but always mourning the loss of her son..her daughter doesn't seem to figure as a major loss! Apparently a tv series was made of this book by the BBC which could possibly portray her as a more sympathetic character than I've painted her. The 4 stars I've awarded the book was for the way it was written, in the form of letters to her friends and entries in her journal and also for the insightful look into life in Japan from early in the 20th century until WW2.	2004-11-30

It's America, in the near future where right wing Christian fundamentalists have taken complete control of all women, decreeing that women may no longer read, write, have jobs or have any opinions of their own. They are divided into classes..wives, owned by men of the ruling class, Martha's, household domestics, Unwomen, those who have proved to be infertile and Handmaids, women who have proved their fertility by giving birth to at least one child.If these fertile women had been married to a  divorced man, they were classed as being promiscuous and therfore enslaved. <br />Infertility is rife among the ruling classes as the result of some kind of ecological disaster, so the idea of using the words of the bible where Ruth uses her handmaiden to act as a surrogate wife to Jacob, so as to have a child, is taken as truth, and all childless officials are allotted a handmaiden with whom he has a ritualised form of sex, once a month, with the wife lying with the handmaiden between her legs. <br />I found this book to be terrifying in the thought that this kind of madness is not beyond the realms of possibility if any kind of fundamentalism is given a foothold in society. It's the stuff of which nightmares are made !!	2004-11-27

Mix is obsessed with the way Christie killed the women and then buried them, either in graves in his garden or in the wall cavities in his home. <br />Mixs' other main obsession is a beautiful, black model who is the subject of his fantasies and whom he stalks on every possible occasion. <br />Mix occupies the attic flat in the huge, mouldering house owned by Gwendolen Chawser, an old, eccentric spinster who lives among dirt and decay, and whose escape from reality is in her collection of fine books which she reads incessantly. Mix meets and brings home with him, a young girl whom he kills after a minor argument. He then thinks of how  Christie would dispose of the body and emulates his methods, his mind and imagination fuelling a fast track to a nervous breakdown. He decides to get rid of Gwendolen in the same way after she becomes suspicious of his connection with the young girl who is now listed as a missing person. It is his plan to kill Gwendolen which proves to be his downfall. <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this latest Ruth Rendell novel and would recommend it to all of her fans.	2004-11-24

The youth was coerced by police into confessing to the murder, even though the evidence was purely circumstantial and because he was simple minded enough to be browbeaten into saying whatever was easiest. Tragically, Howard suicided in prison after 3 years of being bullied and beaten by other inmates. Being convinced of his innocence, Georgina is determined to clear his name and seeks the help of anthropologist and author, Jonathan Hughes, himself suffering from unresolved issues regarding his parentage and his reluctance to acknowledge his racial origins. At first, there is outright hostility between them but, after working together for a short time, an uneasy truce is struck and they find that they work well together as a team. Delving back into the horrific pasts of the children and teenagers who were invoved with the murder case is like opening a door into hell, full of rage, violence, incest, brutality and everything that is warped and hiseous in the lives of these children and their parents. It's not what you'd call a \\"nice\\" read but one which, unfortunately, is not uncommon and gives a big jolt to those of us who still see childhood through rose coloured glasses.	2004-11-21

As a small child, she accidently caused the death of her beautiful,world famous, actress mother and has consquently been ignored by her father.Rebelling against her fathers' indifference, she embarks on a love affair with a local young peasant and is married off to a cold, perverted woman hater who takes her to Paris where she becomes the darling of the modelling world, selfish and spoiled beyond recognition. Her father and sister are assassinated by the warlords of drug cartels which are crippling her country and, in desperation, the few remaining members of her fathers' cabinet, turn to her to educate and train herself to one day use her family name and take over the leadership of her country. All of this takes place and eventually, a major love affair and a child later, she emerges as the saviour of her country. <br />The story, for me, smacks too much of the Grace Kelly story and later, shades of Eva Peron appear, making it just too improbable but, to each his own, and perhaps some will find this a big, romantic read.	2004-11-19

For most of the book, I had only the barest comprehension of the computer speak and what it was supposed to be doing. If you're not well into the computer business, give this book a miss.	2004-11-01

She knows that he is normally too frightened of heights to venture up so high so begins to look more deeply into the circumstamces of his death. <br />It's both a murder mystery and a thriller, set in Denmark and travelling to the Arctic Cap in Greenland, with its characters both theatrical and rather unreal.It's undoubtedly a beautifully written book but, as with all the Scandinavian writers that I've encountered, angst ridden and somehow depressing.	2004-11-01

His love affair with alliteration is fine for a few phrases, but whole chapters..just too tiring.This was probably the wrong book to read as an introduction to his work, so I'll try another where the style is a little more flowing so that one can concentrate on the story without being irritated by hte jerky sentences.	2004-10-23

Schumann travels to Berlin with the US Olympics team under the guise of being a sportswriter and makes contact with the US governments' mole, a resident businessman, Reg Morgan. Through Morgan, he meets various shady underworld figures whom he bribes to obtain information about Ernsts' whereabouts and usual travel routes. Hitlers' vile plans are just fully coming into play with people disappearing and whole groups  of people of different ethnic origins suddenly becoming the victims of wholesale slaughter, supposedly by communist gangs. One of the top criminal detectives in the German police force, Willi Kohl, learns of Schumanns appearance on the local scene and relentlessly tracks his every movement. <br />The whole book is a terrifying concept with the reader knowing the results of Hitlers' being made Chancellor and the foreknowledge of the fates of the German people being swept inexorably along on the tide of thuggery and btutality. I could easily see this book being made into a heart stopping movie.	2004-10-22

To their horror and that of the locals, they witness a terrible accident when a tourist boat, down below them in the harbour, catches fire with the loss of many lives, both local and tourists. As they are too far away to be of any help on the beach, they bond together and begin telling their personal stories as to why they are there at this moment. The group consists of Elsa, a beuutiful, German tv presenter, running away from a suffocating relationship with a demanding lover/boss, David, a quiet Englishman rebelling against his overbearing parents, Thomas, an American adademic on sabbatical, and Fiona, a young Irish nurse who is accompanied by her violent boyfriend. The tavern owner befriends them all and introduces them to a local Irishwoman Vonni, who has lived in the village for many years. <br />M/s Binchy weaves their stories together in an easy and interesting manner, just right for a charming and non-demanding read.	2004-10-19

It reads like a cross between \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" and \\"Howards End, with all the nuances between employers and employees..them and us, and the fascinating details about domestic life in grand houses in the early days of the century. Three quarters of the way through, the bombshell came with the hero displaying pedophiliac behaviour to an 11 year old boy whom he loved desperately. This conduct continued until the boy left the house when 16 years old. I'm not expressing any views about homosexuality but cannot countenance pedophilia in any form. I felt that it was such a pity that what promised to be a wonderful read, made me feel so let down and unsympathetic to a sad, lonely man.	2004-10-13

Many of the topics would probably not be fully understood by non- Australians, as his reminisences centre around very specific suburban memories. As an example, I had conpletely forgotten about the bottles of coloured soft drinks which lined an upper shelf above the fruit and vegetable bins in greengrocers shops in the 40's, never sold and never dusted. His descriptions of well known people can sound cutting and somewhat cruel but the widow of one of his subjects, comedian Jackie Clancy, assures me that his observations are spot on and that she doesn't feel at all upset by his unflattering, albeit admiring remarks. <br />Mr.Adams is quite clearly a very clever, very sharp-witted man and, although some of his stories made me wince a bit, he is nevertheless an extremely readable author.	2004-10-13

Terry had been the recipient of a heart transplant which had apparently been working efficiently until it ceased to beat while he was conducting a fishing cruise for a paying customer. <br />Disgraced FBI agent Rachel Walling has been allowed to return from limbo in a backwater posting, to assist the FBI with their enquiries regarding her old boss and mentor, Robert Backus, a proven serial killer who was supposedly killed by Rachel years previously. Harry and Rachel join forces to track down Backus, known as The Poet, and the story switched from Harrys' home base of Los Angeles and Las Vegas and the Nevada desert, where the bodies of some of Backus' victims are uncovered in shallow graves. <br />Mr Connelley seems to have scant respect for the politics of the FBI, focusing mainly on the arrogance of its' principals and the bitter infighting in the ranks. He writes in an interesting style, presenting Harry Bosch narrating in the first person with Rachel Wallings' story being told in the third person, making for an easy and flowing read.	2004-10-07

Her observations are heard by many of the hospital staff and when, shortly after her surgery, she again raises the subject of dead bodies being trundled around the corridors, her worries are passed off as the ramblings of an old lady suffering post operational delusions, brought on by the effects of anesthesia and shock. When two more murders occurr in the hospital, Julia and Sarah resort to their hobby of amatuer sleuthing, even though both of them become uncomfortably close to the events.

Alexander has also left a beautiful, large country house with twenty thousand pounds a year for its upkeep, to his former wife Marion, with the understanding that it will be kept as a home for the children. <br />The will appoints two trustees to manage the inheritance, old friend Oliver Pocock, a charming gay, and solicitor Geoffrey Montacute, a pompous, boring yet terribly honest man who could be trusted to manage and invest the money for the benefit of Helena and Paul. <br />Marion is a greedy, grasping woman for whom almost any amount of money is never enough so plots ways to get control of the childrens money. She embarks on a plan of seduction to ensnare the dull Geoffrey, virginal in his forties and still living with his bitter, semi-invalided mother. He makes it almost too easy for her, never having enjoyed the attentions of any women, and now to have this glamorous, exotic creature seem to desire his company above all, makes him an easy target to manipulate.  <br />Helena is finding that having more money than her fellow students is proving to be difficult as some are using her for what she can provide rather than for herself. <br />Marion takes Geoffreys advice about transferring Paul to a better school where he soon becomes confused about his sexuality and becomes a very unhappy young man. <br />It's a light, quick read with an interesting twist to the comeuppance of several of the characters.	2004-09-29

Strangely enough, you find yourself empathising with this man as the story proceeds, which it does at a cracking pace. Michael Weston is hired by an unknown client to shoot a TV news journalist. He successsfully carries out his assignment but things start to go awry and he realises that he is being pursued by an old adversary, Leo Hohher, a former NY cop,  now a private investigator. Michael visits Max Harrison, an old friend living deep in the country, to buy guns and ammunition and meets his daughter Bel- gorgeous and a crack shot.

The serpent necklace is found to be missing and Herbert blames Joshua for its absence. He insists that Joshua solves the murder and the theft and threatens to ruin his reputation as a painter and to destroy him artistically as well as financially.

Before she died, she named Danny Padgitt, a member of a notorious local family as her attacker. At the end of his trial, Padgitt threatened revenge on any of the jurors who found him guilty and, when two of those jurors die as the result of foul play, feelings run high in the town. Willie befriends one of the jurors, Callie Ruffin, an articulate and religious black lady, mother os seven college professors, and one who would find difficulty in casting a \\"guilty\\" vote where it would involve the death sentence. Danny Padgitt IS found guilty but, because of the voting of the jurors, is sentenced to a life term which, in Tennessee in those days, meant that he would be released in about 10 years. Wilie settles down comfortably into the life of a small town dweller and dramatically increases the circulation of the newspaper, merging easily into the towns' collection of diverse and colourful characters.

While installing a new library in the country home of Lord Montford, Nathaniel is present when the body of his patron is found shot dead. As Lord Montford was heavily in debt after gambling away a large part of his estate, everyone present at the dinner party which was taking place at the time, is convinced that he has committed suicide..all except Nathaniel! Taking into account bloody footprints in the room and more footprints in the snow outside the window, Nathaniel teams up with one of the dinner guests, neighbour, Lord Foley, to whom Lord Montford was indebted, to do some detective work. The next day, the mutilated body of Nathaniels' friend and workmate is found, frozen in a pond near the house. The box referred to in the books' title, is found near the hand of Lord Montford and proves to be a puzzle box made of many exotic woods..a diversion much sought after by the gentry of that time. It's a deliciously descriptive account of life among the merchant and upper classes of the 18th century, rathy wordy in the style of writers of that period, but a joy to readers of historical fiction.	2004-09-08

M/s Hill has introduced her characters well and focused just briefly on DCI Serrailler to show him to be an intriguing character, distant and rather mysterious but with enough warmth to make the reader want to know more about him. <br />DS Freya Graffham, recently divorced and having transferred from the Met.to Bevham CID, begins a new life in the small town of Lafferton. She joins the cathedral choir and befriends Mereil Serrailler, mother of her DCI and also Dr.Cat Deerbon, local GP and sister to Simon. Several people are reported missing..people highly unlikely to just leave their homes, so the local police are reluctantly forced to consider that a serial killer might be in their quiet neighbourhood. We are informed early in the piece of the fate of these victims, but the events leading up to the crimes being solved are well told and the pace is maintained to the end. I'm looking forward to the next in the series.	2004-08-30

This lady writes in such a lyrical fashion (without being artsy, fartsy)that she conjures up, for me, not only the pictures of the house and land, but the colours and smell of the jasmin and roses, the luscious aromas of cooking the local dishes and the wonderful tastes of the local wines. A word of warning, don't read this book in bed at night or the urge to rush down to the kitchen for a snack at midnight will be almost irresistable! Even if I never visit Tuscany, she has made me feel that, in reading her book, I've stepped into a brilliant, colourful 3D picture, where all of these things have happened in virtual reality.

Eighteen people were killed in the crush and Grace herself was badly injured, leaving her with a permanent limp.Whilw she was recovering, she was befriended by the families of the victims, including a gangster whose son was killed and who assures Grace that he would be there for her if she ever needed help.She contacts him and the plot continues to thicken, with several sinister characters appearing, and this is where the story began to muddle for me, as the situation grew more and more involved and unlikely. The finale takes ages to explain as the threads of the story were sooo involved. It was all too hard!	2004-08-03

Dennis' old friend, Benny Fayle lives nearby with Mallory and Kate Lawson, the new owners of a large house, left to them by Bennys' late employer, and is happy to be about to introduce them to Dennis at a dinner party. When Dennis doesn't arrive, his body is subsequently discovered in his studio with his head crushed by a ball from one of his war machines. Another dimension to the plot is added by the Lawsons' daughter Polly, badly spoiled from childhood by her father and overly cocky about her abilities as an investment advisor. Add yet another fascinating character in the person of Ava Garrett, a theatrical psychic fake who capitalises on her small daughters' abilities, to con gullible people out of money, and you have a totally absorbing read and one which I can really recommend, especially to lovers of crime and mayhem in small English villages.	2004-08-01

When an anonymous tip leads to the arrest of the man she recognises as her rapist, Chloe, now known as CJ, is appointed to prosecute him, even though she has secret doubts about his being the serial killer in the chain of horrific murders that he accused of, and is worried by the almost too fortuitiveness of the tip-off.

Barney studies psychiatry and becomes a top man in his field while Laura specialises in early childhood ailments, especially in new babies. This story follows them and their immediate circle of friends through the trials and tribulations of their training years, into their internships and then into the years that they either enter private practice ot take up hospital positions. I found this story to be a real eye-opener as I hadn't thought about the intense mental and physical stresses imposed upon medical students and how they have to be of a particularly strong character to be able to withstand these pressures without cracking.	2004-07-24

Middlesex is the story of three generations of an American-Greek family, from their escape from a tiny, war-torn village in Turkey to their arrival in America in the 20's. Lefty and Desdemona are the original couple who share a guilty secret from their past, but who struggle to succeed in business and to raise and educate a family. Two generations later, a daughter, Calliope, is born and, despite being almost abnormally tall for a young girl, lives the same life as her school friends. As her mother is excessively modest about bodily functions, Callie pretends that she is developing normally and manages to fool her until circumstances force her to acknowledge that she is an hermaphrodite with the reproductive organs of both male and female. I found it to be a totally engrossing book, written with such a wry sense of humour that nobody could possibly take offence at its' content which is handled delicately and with such compassion.	2004-07-21

I awarded this book 4 stars because I was unable to stop reading it, even though it was gruesome enough to curl the hairs on the back of your neck. Police Chief Charlie Grover finds three mutilated bodies in a house in the aftermath of a tornado. An initial look seems to show the victims of the storm but closer inspection reveals not only deliberate stab wounds made by someone in an attempt to make it appear as storm damage, but also reveals that from each victim, a tooth has been roughly pulled out and replaced with an animals' tooth. This in itself was nearly enough to cause me to abandon the book, but as the author had by then introduced some fascinating characters, I was compelled to continue. Charlie is drawn into the strange world of the storm chasers, dare-devils who take incredible risks to travel to the very edges of huge storms. It's an exciting, pacy book, albeit one laced with really nasty details of the crimes of a pyschopathic killer.	2004-07-13

He reviews old cases and is drawn to one which he worked on for a brief time, 4 years previously. A temperamental and autocratic movie producer had insisted on using real money for close ups on a movie and the studio provided 2 million dollars. An armed robbery took place in which one of the police was shot and made a paraplegic, but the case was never solved. One of the studio workers, Angella Benton, was murdered in the lobby of her own apartment building and as this case was never solved, Harry begins to try to connect the two. It's an involved solution which takes a lot of concentration to follow and perhaps readers of the Harry Bosch series who are familiar with his friends and workmates will find it a more interesting read than someone who comes to this book cold.	2004-07-07

Monks'wife Hester runs a shelter and hospital for sick and injured prostitutes with her friend Margaret, stocking it on a shoe string budget, so that when Louvain brings a sick woman to her, claiming that she is the cast-off mistress of a friend and paying Hester a handsome fee for her care, she doesn't hesitate to accept the woman as a patient. Meanwhile Monk manages to find the trail of the stolen ivory with the help of a street urchin, Scuff, and to return it to Louvain. Hester is horrified to find the unmistakeable signs of bubonic plague on the sick woman and realises that she must isolate herself and all the other occupants of the hospital, as much to keep them from infecting the general population as to keep the threat of mass hysteria at bay. She is aided in this task by the rat-catcher, Sutton who directs his friends to stand guard with pit bulls, trained to kill on command. Hester gets word to Monk of their predicament and in turn informs Durban the chief of the river police of the need to track down the source of the plague. Feeling sure that the plague was brought into the country by Louvain on his ship, Monk and Durban contrive to isolate the ship until their case is proven.  The author brilliantly conveys the cutting winds and biting cold of the London docks in winter, so much so that I guarantee that you'll not feel warm till the end of the story.	2004-07-05

During WW2, Elizabeth White, only daughter of a middle class family from London, was evacuated to Ireland, to the home of Eileen O'Connor, a schooldays friend of Violet, Elizabeths' mother. She spends 5 happy years with them, bonding as a sister with Aisling, the O'Connor of her own age, growing up as one of their large, noisy family and attending their local catholic school. When the war is over, she reluctantly returns to her own constantly unhappy parents, acting as a buffer between them until the day when her mother decides that she can bear it no longer and leaves to set up house with her long time lover. The story covers the lives of Elizabeth in England and Aisling in Ireland through their teenage years and into womanhood, and I can truly say that I enjoyed the read even more, the second time around.	2004-07-02

Marty teams with Harry Madigan, her law partner and lover to produce a credible defence in the face of overwhelming evidence and at the same time, defend a battered woman whose live-in attacker was murdered. M/s Connors own courtroom experience comes into play here with her expert knowledge of procedures and some almost unbelievable courtroom characters who, one only prays, we will never have to face in person.

Tyrell and his off sider, Sgt. Clarke investigate the matter without getting too much help from the Foresters, as the local inhabitants are known. Tyrell is continually hampered in his investigations by the jealous rantings of his nemesis, DCI Whitaker, a man close to the edge of total breakdown.

She recovered after extensive therapy from Julia who eventually married Francine's father making her Francine's full time carer, an occupation which turned into an obsessively protective cocoon. Teddy Grez was the product of a completely non-nuturing childhood with his parents and uncle totally ignoring him, with the reult that this handsome young man became excessively slf absorbed and unable to relate to others. When the beautiful Francine met the handsome Teddy, the attraction was instantaneous and, on Teddy's part, all encompassing, with tragic and frightening results. This has been my favourite Ruth Rendell to date with all of her psycopathic characters and their bizarre compulsions terrifying to say the least!	2004-04-18

I realise that this probably happens even now but at least these days, females have grown up knowing themselves to be the equal of males and without having to apologise for sometimes being smarter.Jill was fortunate to have a very good education but was also responsible for earning Australian government scholarships which are awarded solely on the good marks earned in exams( not by good luck as one reviewer implied).Even so, she was, not so subtley reminded that a woman's primary function was as a wife and mother and as a mere adjunct to her husband and even brothers. This state of affairs probably existed in all cultures at that time, and not just i Australia, but even as I read, that old feeling of suffocation was present...the feeling that you wanted more but of what, you couldn't say and your parents certainly didn't understand either.	2004-04-18

The trail winds its way through the drawing rooms of the nobility and into the bawdy houses of Londons night world, touching pockets of treachery and corruption at all levels. This book has no connection to the wonderful Outlander series except that it uses Lord John Grey as its main character, but it really does provide the clearest,and probably closest to the truth, insight to the world on London in 1757.	2004-04-04

He plans a spectacular introduction of her first hit song accompanied by a controversial video of her being mock raped by a black dancer, dressed as a mythical beast, on a luxury motor launch on the river. Three masked figures appear and drag Tamar away to a waiting speed boat in front of a stunned audience. A phone call demanding $250,000 in ransom is made to Loomis's office and so the local police from the 87th precinct and the FBI are called in. The pace is cracking and the dialogue is authentic sounding as plots are laid by the baddies and plans are made for Tamar's rescue by the cops.

At a shooting party at the estate of Sir Randolph Nettleby, rooms are allocated so that lovers rooms are discreetly close, and the rituals of what is the thing to do and what one wears for the occasion, are rigidly adhered to. The book is really a social commentary on the morals and mores of the English upper classes at that particular time in history, just a few short months before the beginning of WW1, and just prior to the events which will change their way of life forever. A counterpoint to the rustic idyll of a shooting party is an eccentric animal rights protestor who gate crashes the shoot and a local poacher who ends up being the unwitting victim of the macho exhibitionism of one of the shooters. It's a fascinating glimpse into the privileged world of the aristocracy before their world changed completely.	2004-03-17

James had supposedly drowned himself upon discovering that he had inherited syphillis from his father. After the disappearance, his father refused to believe him dead and, even after the obligatory 7 years absence, would not have him declared legally dead. After the father dies, James's younger brother Hugo becomes baronet in his place and is therefore horrified to learn of the challenge to his new found wealth and position. Richard Davenall, sousin to James and Hugo and also the family solicitor, is put in the invidious position of having to deny the claims of the recently reappearing James or of helping him to prove his rightful place in the family.

The hero, Sergeant Matt Payne, the university educated scion of a wealthy Philadelphia family, is promoted to the Homicide division where, despite his youth and relative inexperience, he proves to be a first class cop and is obviously on his way to becoming a public hero. The ending is a bit of a cliff-hanger as our hero and his friend, Pulitzer prize winning journalist Mickey O'Hara, see to the extradition of a well known and long sought crook from Paris, back to Philadelphia. I hope that it isn't too long before the new book appears.	2004-01-15

Lizzie Bartholomew is a trained social worker who has been involved in a terrifying experience with a mentally disturbed patient with homicidal tendencies and is still suffering from the after shock. She becomes involved with a married man while on holiday and so, indirectly, with a violent murder and a web of deceit and cover-ups. It's very well written but the atmosphere of gloom an mind games was too much for my taste which runs more to straight detective type thrillers.	2004-01-11

When an animal rights group swarms over a scientific complex, human bones are found in a swampy area, giving the police an extra reason to probe deeply into the goings on of the pharmaceutical company who run the place. Mr.Hill is an extremely erudite writer with a splendid command of the English language..it will also help my vocabulary as I have to keep the Oxford at hand to keep up with him. This story returns frequently to the French battlefields of WW1 via the diaries of Pascoe's grandfather who was shot for desertion after a ruling by a kangaroo court, so this connection injects a very personal touch, linking Pascoe with the present case through past generations.	2004-01-07

What incredibly strong women these were, to survive and even thrive under the hideous regime of slavery. This is a story of four generations of women, some born into slavery and others after the freeing of the slaves, but all of them still bearing the so-called stigma of coloured skin. I was (naively) amazed to find out that the degree of colour of skin could determine a persons place in black society, and also seriously influence the way in which the families of former slaves could rise in the business and social stratum of society. I enjoyed this story as a fascinating historical document and also as a touching family saga about powerful women who refused to buckle under life's adversities.	2003-12-30

An elderly resident of a nursing home, Stella, is befriended by Genevieve,her special carer. Gradually Stella unfolds her story which in parts is sad, ordinary, suspenseful and terrible. At the same time as Genevieve is hearing Stella's story, she is, in part, re-enacting the same story with her secret lover, Ned.<BR>Stella's lover, Alan, is married to a b-grade movie actress from the 40's whose role playing and drama queen dramatics alienate both her husband and her friends.

In 1905, a young Danish couple arrive in England with their two small sons. The husband, Rasmus, becomes a total Anglophile while his wife Asta, struggles with language problems,loneliness and depression as she is left alone with the children for long periods of time while Rasmus travels on business.To while away the hours, Asta starts a diary which she continues for the majority of her life. Years later, her descendants discover and publish the diaries which become an international success and which bring to life a number of unanswered questions about a sensational murder trial and the dubious birth of one of Asta's daughters. At first I struggled with the various characters, finding it difficult to place them in the right generations but all became clear eventually. The plot is involved, with red herrings strewn all over the place--an intriguing read and worth perservering with as all the solutions come right at the end of the book.	2003-09-17

Rumpole has no aspirations to &quot;take silk&quot;-becoming a Queens Counsel, and is perfectly happy as a defence lawyer, mostly representing criminals of the non-violent variety.We also meet his wife Hilda, &quot;She Who Must Be Obeyed&quot;, who, after all these years, still envisions herself as the wife of Head of Chambers. All of the other characters who occupy the Rumpole stories emerge in these short tales--sneaky, slightly effeminate Erskine-Brown, the bumbling Guthrie Featherstone and the other lawyers and clerks whose lives weave in and out of these stories. You'll love them all and particularly cigar smoking,claret swilling Rumpole himself.	2003-09-10

Two events occur which start a cycle of unstoppable violence.A young girl goes missing and a blabbermouth social worker lets it be known that a convicted paedophile is housed on the same working class estate, which is so badly designed that it forms a bottle neck, limiting entrance and entrance.An attractive young female doctor is called to the house of the paedophile to treat his ailing father and is held captive by them.When a group of women on the estate hold a march to protest about the presence of the paedophile, yobs take over and start to fire bomb the house where he is living. In the ensueing violence, several people are killed and a number of them injured in the panic to escape the streets. It's gripping reading but certainly not pretty and I find it difficult to work up much sympathy for these misfits of society who exist on public hand-outs.	2003-08-30

What annoyed me was his whining attitude towards his father for dying and leaving him (as if he could help this !) and towards his mother, for her love and loyalty to her husband. This was a much loved and cherished child who blamed all of his failings in life on the fact that he was left fatherless as a child, but enjoyed a loving home and what would have been a fine education if he had applied himself and stopped drowning in self pity.	2003-08-18

Can't go into detail as it would give away the plot but suffice to say that there is suspense, tension and the expectation of iminent violence. M/s Murphy describes her scenes in the police Special Operation room in as much detail as if she were writing a script for a tv cop show which is a very effective way of writing in this genre. I gave it 5 stars (unusual for me) for good plotting, tight writing and her ability to hold the readers attention to the end without missing a beat.	2003-05-03

Retired school teacher, Julia Garnet, is lonely and at a loss with what to do with her life after the death of her flat mate of many years, and decides to spend 6 months in Venice. A confirmed communist, she is amazed at the ease with which she is falling under the spell of the magnificent architecture, especially the churches, which at first she finds decadent, in view of her strict anti-church attitude. She befriends a young couple who are restoring an old chapel and becomes very involved in their lives, as well as meeting- and being totally charmed by a very dashing art dealer- who wines and dines her.Julia falls in love for the first time in her life and is shattered when things don't turn out as well as she'd hoped. I found this book to have an other-worldly feel to it as though Venice itself was responsible for normally prosiac people acting differently, just as if they were somehow charmed and under the influence of old paintings and statues, particularly those of the angel Raphael, whose biblical story interweaves with that of Julia. It's a gem of a book with such a luminous feel to it that I'm sure I'll read it again fairly soon.	2003-03-06

His writing style reveals his newspaper background and the story flows brilliantly and succinctly. A wealthy,gay antiques dealer, Jim Williams,  had made his mark in Savannah society by his famous Xmas parties where no expense was spared.All society flocked to these gatherings even though Williams was never admitted to the top echelons of Georgia society and didn't quite make the VERY best clubs. In May,1981, a bisexual young man, Danny Hansford, was shot dead by Jim Williams in what Williams swore was self defence. Danny had worked sporadically for Jim who admitted that sex had been a major part of their relationship.Danny was known to be a violent,destructive drug user who was always in trouble with the law.

After a break of some years,I read Envoy Extraordinary and was swept right back into 13th century Scotland. While accepting the fact that probably only devotees of actual history (as opposed to historical fiction) will read this book, it's the absolute magic of Nigel Tranters writing that transports you back to those difficult and rather savage times. He can take a relatively minor figure of that era and cause the reader to view history in the making. Patrick, Earl of Dunbar and March, becomes one of the panel of regents to the child king,Alexander the 3rd and later, his special envoy to other kingdoms.This takes place at the very end of an era where,hereafter, rebellions and movements against the aggressions of Edward Plantagenet,king of England, and the covetous eyes of the Vikings and Norsemen who laid claim to Scotland, came into being.It's a great read for the history buff and for anyone with Scottish blood in their veins.	2002-12-27

Another interesting facet of life at that time is the difference between the outward display of decency and morality and the total decadence of life in the brothels and drug dens which were frequented by the so-called gentlemen of that era.	2002-12-11

I found Shadow Dance to be an unusual kind of murder-thriller in that it involves just as much sex and romance as murder and mystery. A crazed killer is mutilating and murdering show girls at casinos around Reno.<BR>Scot-American detective, Tristan MacLaughlin, is sent from Seattle to help the local police with their investigations and meets, and clashes head-on with Amanda Charles, a tall, beautiful dancer with a definite touch of class, and the sparks between them start to fly at once.<BR>When Amanda's life is threatened, Tristan moves in with her as her bodyguard and the inevitable love affair begins. The mystery aspect of the book is negligible as the murderer is easily spotted and the book really revolves around the sexual tension between them.

Julia Pallister lives with her feisty grandmother, a former lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth I, and her mother Anne, a gentle mild mannered woman who lives only for the day when her husband returns home from exile with Prince Charles. Their home has been saved from sequestration by the Parliamentarians by the old love affair between Julia's grandmother and the neighbouring landowner, a Cromwell supporter, but, upon his death, the order is revoked and their home is taken over by a tyrannical Parliamentarian, Makepeace Walker who was one of the signators of the death warrant of CharlesI. After Julia's father is shot and killed by the Roundheads, Makepeace forces Anne into marriage by threatening to put the entire household out on the street. The story continues and takes in the Great Plague of 1665 and the Great Fire of London in 1666, Julia's youthful adoration of childhood friend, Christopher Wren and her eventual happy marriage to the grandson of her grandmother's old lover.

She lifts you up and floats you along on such an ethereal cloud-filmy but magically intense-so that you can literally forget where you are. I don't normally rabbit on about prose but this is very special. The story is simple and I don't want to give anything away as it would ruin the reading of the book.

It's a hand to mouth existence with only the hope of enough food to sustain them on a daily basis and enough money from the crops that they can spare to be sold, to pay the rent of their fields. When her husband runs off in search of a more exciting life, the mother is left with the care of the family and is forced to work like a beast of burden in order to exist.

When Mattie became pregnant to Jake,as a teenager, he reluctantly married her, always making her aware of this lack of love.Even now, their 15 year old daughter Kim, is aware of the friction between her parents and is reacting badly.Jake leaves the family home to move in with his latest mistress and it takes a real tragedy in the shape of Lou Gehrigs disease to reunite them, even though it's only a surface reunion.

This second book in the Miss Julia series is an amusing,quick read.Miss Julia is a fairly recent widow,who is quietly glorying in the freedoms that widowhood has brought. In defiance of her stuffy neighbours in a small Southern town, she has refused to be bullied into handing over the control of her quite substantial fortune to the elders of her church and also horrifed them by taking in her late husbands mistress,Hazel Marie and her son, Little Lloyd.Under her care, they have both blossomed and the three of them have formed a close family unit. When Hazel Marie's scheming uncle plots to have Little Lloyd given into his care,the better to gain control of the childs inheritance, Hazel Marie is kidnapped,forcing Miss Julia to hire a private detective to find her.It does tend to become a touch farcical at this point with plots littered with crooked racing car drivers,shonky church fund raisers and Miss Julia driving around a Nascar circuit and out- driving the professionals.I didn't think that this book was as good as the first,but hopefully, M/S Ross will be back to form with book 3.	2002-06-15

Before writing this review, I read all of the reviews previously written, and was horrified by the arrant snobbery of SOME of the reviewers. These, in particular, were Southern readers whose opinions left me flabbergasted by their narrowness of mind in condemming the factory workers who were left jobless by the closure of the factory in which they worked. One reviewer even suggested that these women, uneducated as they were, would never be capable of belonging to a quilting bee. Happily I know that this attitude is completely false having spent time recently as a guest of a number of Southern ladies who would be totally horrified to learn of attitudes like this.The female workers of a recently closed lingerie factory band together with the help of a recently divorced counsellor who is suffering from the shock and disillusionment of finding out that she now has to make her own way in the world--in her late 40's--as her husband became bankrupt and took off with a younger woman.Over the course of a year, these women learn not only how to support themselves, but also how how to gain strength and courage from mutual encouragement. I truly believe that this is a wonderfully inspiring book and I enjoyed it thoroughly.	2002-06-01

The heroine, Darla, is trapped in an almost empty town with a sluttish mother who is the town prostitute and a pathetic weed of a sister who is married to a drunken,wife beating husband and despite her dreams of becoming a top fashion designer, is perpetually held back by a moral sense of responsibility to her family.

Very shortly following W.W.2 Claire Randall,a young Englishwoman and former battlefield nurse,is second honeymooning in the Scottish highlands with her husband Frank. While on a solitary walk,she enters a time-travel portal in a group of rocks and finds herself in 1743 Scotland,just prior to the Jacobite uprising and the Battle of Culloden.She meets a young (and gorgeous) Highland warrior she she instantly recognises as her soulmate.This is a &quot;rippingly good yarn&quot; as it encompasses adventure,passion and rather graphically detailed sex. I'd defy any red blooded woman NOT to fall madly in love with Jamie Fraser...as Claire did,and to find it difficult to put this book down before the end!	2002-01-17

This tale of court life in Japan in the 11th century is not to be rushed.The prose is poetry,the tiny lines of poetry which occur frequently are like music-tinkly sounds like mini waterfalls .It's a collection of beautiful word pictures mainly describing scenes in nature and the colours of beautiful fabrics which also reflect the hues of trees,flowers and mosses.

I've just finished reading &quot;Miss Julia speaks her mind&quot; at a time when I needed something light to read to keep my mind off other things.Not only did this story succeed in keeping my mind occupied but I was entertained and charmed by this delightful little book.Miss Julia,a recent widow,is just starting to come to grips with her new life when her husbands mistress arrives on her doorstep with a boy that she claims is his illegitimate son.Her husband,like some I've known in real life (not me!) kept her emotionally and financially in thrall to him so that,only now is she able to have her own opinions for the first time in her life and not have to be totally dedicated to doing things his way. For a woman of her generation who has been &quot;guided&quot; byher husband and his church's view on the subjugation of wives and women in general,this is very heady stuff !! The story is pacy,almost rollicking,and told in a Southern style of speech that I found charming,and I will now wait eagerly fot the sequel to come out in paperback. If Southern ladies are anything at all like Miss Julia,I can't wait to meet them !	2001-11-08

This is a tale of people overcoming grief and lonlieness and coming together to share Xmas and a healing time together. It's not a mawkish story but warm and cosy with a feeling of belonging .Ms.Pilcher is so very good at recreating country scenes with an absolutely right touch and I'm sure that her readers will not be disappointed by this delightful book.	2001-08-08

The lowest social layer of all are, strangely enough, most like the topmost layer in that they are totally confident in their milieu and don't give a damn about anyone else!!

The story of The Forest begins shortly after the closure of these acres by William the Conqueror ,to create a natural hunting reserve for the benefit of himself and the nobles of his court. The saga continues through the major periods of English history and involves both the more aristocratic of the forests inhabitants as well as the local peasantry.The family lines of both of these classes of the forests inhabitants,weave their ways down through the years, occasionally intertwining and always maintaining the forest as an entity in it's own right. This is a fascinating glimpse of history through the ages and an equally fascinating look at the lives and customs of the forest dwellers over the centuries.

John Le Carre made me think,and caused me to feel so ashamed that more&quot;civilised&quot;countries could be responsible for the sickness and hideous deaths of these poor,innocent victims,simply to get a drug on the market before anyone else beat them to it. I think that a proof of the integrity of his writing in causing me to forget that I was reading a novel,speaks for itself. I am so impressed with his passion and style that his characters are really irrelevant as I found that the actual story was overshadowed by the cause that he espouses--that of bringing world attention to the power of these huge conglomerates.Thank you,Mr.LeCarre for opening my eyes.	2001-05-31

The author,Stella Tilyard has meticulously recounted not only the letters,but also the social customs,fashions in clothing and house decorating and the whole way of life amongst the aristocrats of London and Dublin of that era which spans the years of the reigns of George 2nd,George 3rd and the Prince Regent. Each of these sisters lived an extraordinary life,having been educated far above the usual standard required of upper class young women of their day.There is quite a bit of English political history included in the book(which is why I deducted one star),but although this can get a bit ponderous at times,doesn't distract from the overall story.I thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to seeing the t.v.series.	2001-05-31

I enjoyed the third book in the Camulod series slightly less than the previous two.I felt that the author got bogged down with detail in both the battle scenes and the theological discussions.Merlyn comes through as very human rather than the complete mystic that he's been portrayed in other stories,being brought out of his rather pompous attitude towards right and wrong by his cousin,Uther. If you are planning to read the entire series,this is an important bridge between the earlier times of the Roman occupation and the first emergence of Arthur,as a baby.Now for number four-The Saxon Shore.	2001-05-08

Calling all lovers of historical novels,and in particular,Arthurian lovers---This is a wonderful book!It begins in Britain as the Roman legions are leaving,and we meet the 2 great grandfathers of King Arthur. The pace is incredible,the story plausible and the characters totally believable--real people with human foibles but of a very high standard of human expectations,and sets the scene for what is to follow.I can't wait to read all the other 4 books in this,The &quot;Camulod&quot; series.I promise that you won't be disappointed!	2001-04-26

I enjoyed &quot;The Pilot's Wife&quot; only moderately as I found it a bit hard to cope with the almost saintly attitude of Kathryn. If I found myself in the same position as she,I'm sure that I'd become an Othello-like female,full of bitterness and thoughts of revenge(even though it would be too late to wreak revenge on my lying,cheating husband!)She appears to be a rather wooden person,who allowed herself to be patronised by her older husband,as does often happen.The first thing that annoyed me was that her husband conspired with her mother to buy their house without even consulting her--what woman would like that?And-couldn't she,or rather would any normal woman,realise that something was drastically wrong with their marriage when the sex stops for no apparent reason?We wouldn't buy that tiredness bit either! As for Mattie the teenage daughter-if she's mature enough to be having sex,she's mature enough to help support her mother through a really traumatic time,and if I had a daughter of that age who sulked,shrugged her shoulders at me and was generally a pain,it could only be concluded that she was very badly brought up ,spoiled rotten and should have had the benefit of the occasional slap around the back of the legs!!! I'm sick to death of teenagers being taught that they are the centre of the universe and that everything revolves around their demands!O.K. of course she's devastated by the death of her father with whom she had a very close relationship,but at 15,she's old enough to understand what the loss of her husband means to her mother. The rest of the plot was pretty far-fetched with a most unsatisfactory ending.	2001-04-16

The previous reviewer,judithb,has written a perfect precis of the story so I won't bother repeating the story.It's the old(unfortunately) story of a lonely,vulnerable woman of sixty,still attractive and with a good,solid writing career,meeting an attractive,sexy(even at 65) man who knows a good thing when he sees it and promptly decides to make the moves on her.A con man with considerable charm,he lulls and woos her into a state of submission,and if it were not for her canny friends and daughter,would have undoubtedly destroyed her life. I became uneasy with him right from the word go and this spoiled my reading of the book as I was just waiting  for the inevitable to happen.One hopes that all women will have good friends to give them a good shake if they're unfortunate enough to succumb to late life&quot;love affairs&quot; and rescue them before too much damage is done.	2001-04-10

It's not a book to strain anyones concentration as it flows along so pleasantly and is just what one could call&quot;a nice little read&quot;.I don't mean that to sound patronising but it's a feel good read which I hope that others will enjoy.	2001-03-29

This is a review of the book rather than the taped version.I grew up in a suburb of Melbourne,Australia and so am fully cognisant of that era in Australia and,being convent educated,of the morals and mores of that time.I laughed till I nearly made myself sick and then laughed some more! I don't know whether or not growing up in the U.S. in a country town in that era would be very different  but I can only hope that it rings a bell with other readers. If you would just like a great big belly laugh and to enjoy a simple,uncomplicated story,you'll love this account of a larrikin of a boy(I don't know the American word to use for a naughty scamp  who's always in trouble).	2001-03-28

I found the story of PeeJoe and his crazy Aunt Lucille to be a wickedly funny book with dark undertones.In the time of serious civil unrest in Alabama,the parallel stories both have moments of hilarious comedy and frightening truths about the way people see each other in their different worlds.Lucille decides that she's had quite enough of her appalling husband who,she's convinced,has been the sole reason for her not being a famous movie star.She therefore slips rat poison into his coffee and after cutting off his head(with great difficulty)pops it into a Tupperware lettuce keeper-I'll never be able to look at mine in the same light again!She then sets out for Hollywood,complete with the head and starts the great adventure.Meanwhile,PeeJoe is caught up in the civil rights confrontations and quickly learns that he will never again see life in the same way.I can't imagine anyone NOT liking this book and intend looking up the other things that Mark Childress has written.	2000-10-21

To add to his dreadful,poor little life,Francis  had the added burden of an alcoholic father who would rather drink his  wages than feed his starving,malnourished children and a well-meaning but  ineffectual mother who produced babies regularly,only to see them die.

The greed and larceny of  the bishops and senior churchmen doesn't do much to enhance ones view of  the early Christian church and the terrible horror of war and destruction  and wholesale slaughter by both christians and non-christians alike is  shocking in its savagery. In spite of all this,it's a fascinating window  into the lifestyles and minds of all classes of people of that era. I'm  looking forward to volume two.	2000-05-17

I feel quite cheated having paid for a paperback(yes,we have to pay very highly for the privilege of buying a book)-expecting an entertaining novel as the front and back covers suggested,and instead found I'd spent my money on a poorly written text book!	2000-01-30

Recently widowed Kate contacts former high school friends on the advice of her grief therapist and meets Eric,her first love,now married to a dedicated career woman who refuses to  consider starting a family,although why this wasn't discussed before  marriage,one can't imagine!  She sells the family home and returns to her  hometown to open a B and B,much to the horror of her teenaged  daughter,newly at college. After many trials and tribulations(including an  unexpected pregnancy) everyone lives happily ever after. This was,I  thought,a fairly typical soap,until the last pages of the book,when I found  that I couldn't swallow the huge lump in my throat as I read the wedding  scene,and found tears of happiness trickling down my cheeks. I'm not a book  crier and haven't felt totally choked up by a book since the attic scene  between Jo and Beth in &quot;little Women&quot; which I read when I was 12.  So what was it about the wedding scene that was SO moving? Just Ms.Spencers  wonderful ability to get right into the emotion of the moment and make you  feel that you were there in person. I'll NEVER sneer at romantic stories  again-promise!	2000-01-26

The story of a pretty,young prostitute who hires a glamourous blue ball gown from a pimp,to attract customers.She is the mother of a baby who was born with his heart outside his chest cavity,and attracts the attention of  a young doctor who was involved in the infamous Burke and Hare scandal of  body snatching and the murder of indigents to supply cadavers for medical  schools.  The prose is wonderful and the stench of filth,poverty and death  remains in ones nostrils.This is life at its most degrading and the thought  that people really lived like this is unbelievable!You'll need a hot bath a  a good hair scrub after reading this!	1999-12-20
