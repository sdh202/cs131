7981:US	50287514	R186696IJ7WM3S	1590524268	214937332	When the Day of Evil Comes (Dylan Foster Series #1)	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Makes My Top Ten List	In \\"When the Day of Evil Comes,\\" Dylan Foster, a psych professor, finds her career, her beliefs, and her safety on the line in this creepy thriller.  The title and cover caught my attention, but the first chapter proved that Melanie Wells could deliver.  Dylan comes face to face with a strange, pale, scarred man; her mother's engagement ring reappears from the grave; and the story takes off from there.<br /><br />Throughout this chilling tale, Wells lightens the mood through her character's wry humor.  I'd love to meet Dylan Thomas again in a sequel.  She's strong and independent, yet susceptible to a bit of romance and spiritual wrestling.  She's not religious, but she believes in a personal God.  The biblical ideas presented here are clear and sound, without being too preachy.  Some reviewers seemed to want more direct answers at the conclusion, while I appreciated the author's decision to leave some things for interpretation.  Life isn't always black and white, easily defined, nicely wrapped in a box.<br /><br />If you like Dean Koontz or Frank Peretti, you'll find a lot to like here.  Yet this book stands on its own two feet, original, with a female perspective, and perfectly paced.  I hope Melanie Wells is working on the next one, because \\"When the Day of Evil Comes\\" ranks as one of my favorite thrillers this year--and one of the best Christian thrillers ever.<br /><br />***With some of the shady things I've seen in reviews recently, I must add: I've never met, communicated with, or received any compensation from this author.	2005-10-09
8468:US	50287514	R1PNG9PHAOSN9H	094267927X	648587365	Purple Sun: An epic tale of war and redemption	Books	4	4	6	N	N	3 1/2 Stars...A Worthy Effort	My hat is off to any author who finishes a book, produces it for the masses, then goes to the trouble of marketing it on his own time and money.  What an incredible accomplishment.  McAuliffe should find deep satisfaction in what he has done, for it's a worthy effort.<br /><br />\\"Purple Sun\\" takes some of the author's knowledge of the Vietnam War and assimilates it into a fictional tale of a guilt-ridden soldier who disappears after being sent back into action.  Has Billy Kern finally met his end?  Has he gone AWOL?  Or, as later accounts suggest, has he sought a spiritual atonement for the things he has seen and done?<br /><br />The book tackles the questions of war and loyalty, heroism and bravery.  The cover calls it an epic.  In all honesty, I would not qualify this as epic literature, either in scale or language.  The dialogue is well done, the characters are memorable, and the narrative has moments of beauty and grace.  But there are a number of problems.  The author jumps around from one person's thoughts to the next--a violation of point-of-view, which is addressed in nearly every book on the craft of writing fiction.  Also, the scenes are broken into past and present in a convoluted manner which detracts from the story's power.  With a few changes, or with the prudent eye of an editor, I believe \\"Purple Sun\\" could've accomplished as much, if not more, by shifting some sequences and by deleting some of the redundant dialogues midway through.  We know that Isaiah wants to put ghosts to rest and that Gallo wants to pursue them.<br /><br />McAuliffe shows a true understanding of human nature, and I appreciated his dealing with serious issues that surely impacted him profoundly in his own experience.  In the end, a worthy goal for any novelist is to wrestle with his own questions and present them in an honest fashion while presenting readers with a satisfying story.  In this, the author succeeds.  I thank him for the opportunity to read his work.	2005-10-09

I've always longed for such an escapade myself, so this was a vicarious experience of sorts.<br /><br />\\"The Sand House\\" is a joyous and often times humorous telling of the author's days in a small cottage near the Atlantic shoreline. The book focuses on the beauty of her surroundings--the plants, the wildlife, the birds--and on the realities of life in a constricted space with a loved one. The book's title is evocative, tangy and alive, romantic yet earthy. It suits Cynthia's writing perfectly. She is a poet of prose. Her words linger and dance, like cool breezes over the surf. She conjures wonderful images and ideas. She is abstract in her thinking, yet she grabs intangible concepts and wraps them in the sweaty language which humans understand.<br /><br />If you're looking for quick reading and plot-driven stories, look elsewhere. If, however, you long for tales of lazy summer days told in lyrical language, \\"The Salt House\\" is not to be missed.	2005-09-19

The church has become a tame, domesticated version of what Jesus seemed to introduce.  Nearly every page of this book highlights invaluable concepts for the Christian life as it was meant to be lived.  I can relate to the author; I was born and raised to walk the barbarian way--living my faith in a way that demands obedience at any cost.<br /><br />While others have tackled similar subjects, they often times seem to be full of bitterness and rebellion toward the church at large.  McManus never gives off that sense of a grudge; instead, he wants to raise the church from its slumber.  His \\"barbarian\\" way is a way of sacrifice and servitude.  This is no mamby-pamby gospel that he's talking about.  This is a commitment to a life lived for Jesus, no matter the cost.<br /><br />I loved everything this book had to say.  My only complaint is what it didn't say.  It didn't give us any practical ways to walk the barbarian way while dealing with the existing church.  How do we make these concepts real without seeming divisive?  Or, if we are to be divisive for a purpose, how do we go about it with Godly accountability?  These are issues I've wrestled with for years.  This book encouraged me to keep wrestling, but it failed to answer some of my deepest questions.<br /><br />For those who are still \\"civilized,\\" this book might change your world.  For those still trying to reconcile McManus' concepts with everyday church life, you will be inspired.  The question remains, though...Where do we go from here?	2005-09-13

Others create great pacing, while never developing the characters.  \\"The Double Eagle\\" tries to do both, with mixed results.<br /><br />From the start, I could see that Twining would go against the grain of his English roots, choosing to focus on a fast-paced, Hollywood worthy plot.  In most ways, he succeeds.  He gives us short chapters, suspenseful scenes, and lots of twists and questions, ala Dan Brown.  Along the way, the characters show signs of depth, but not much--also like Mr. Brown.  For an Englishman, Twining captures American dialogue decently, with a few glaring exceptions that a U.S. editor should've caught.<br /><br />The plot makes up for some of this, but does so by using just about every cliche in the suspense genre.  As the book reached the last 100 pages, I was groaning.  It seemed to take on a movie/comic book feel.  Too many coincidences, near misses, and bungling criminals.  For me, what started out with promise turned into another dashed hope.	2005-09-12

I would almost lament the time it's taken me to get to this fantastic novel, except that I believe it was for a reason.  Indeed, Aidan's journey of faith through the course of the story mirrors my own in many ways.  It was a tale I needed to experience at this very point in my life.<br /><br />Without getting into matters of historical veracity (since they can be explored ad nauseum on the author's site and other places), let me say that the details of the era rang true as I devoured the narrative.  Not only do the sights, colors, sounds, and smells take on a life of their own, but even the sentence structure and vocabulary polish and heighten the richness of the text.<br /><br />Starting with a straightforward task, a group of monks leave Ireland with the Book of Kells, to be given as a gift to the ruler of Christendom in Constantinople.  Their travels lead them through dangers and triumphs, friendships and betrayals, faith and overwhelming doubt.  There is beauty and love to be discovered, as well as violence and slavery.  Told through the eyes of Aidan, the plot is paced to perfection, in regards to both the physical and spiritual toils encountered.<br /><br />Lawhead writes this story with the bittersweet understanding of a man who has faced inner struggles similar to his protagonist.  His ability to put these feelings to paper, through the thoughts of a monk living in an era removed from ours by over a thousand years, is the mark of a gifted novelist.  And, truly, \\"Byzantium\\" is a gift of a novel.	2005-08-31

(Or was I the only one who nodded off in Social Studies classes?)  In \\"King's Ransom,\\" the authors bring to life a little known section of WWII history.  Bulgaria seems distant and exotic, even inaccessible, but this book clears all these hurdles and makes the country seem rich in character and color.<br /><br />The book opens and closes with thoughts of an old man, a former guard for WWII's King Boris of Bulgaria.  The story itself unfolds through the years of Hitler's occupation.  We get to see the internal struggles of the king as he tried to placate Hitler, while keeping his own people alive.  Bulgaria, caught on all sides by extreme pressure, faced violence and death.  Somehow, with political acumen, King Boris managed to walk a tightrope that, ultimately, protected thousands of Jews from extermination.<br /><br />The authors do a wonderful job of portraying the king's struggles, as well as the travails of the common people.  You'll find suspense, romance, intrigue, and spiritual strength here.  Although it starts off with a lot of information to assimilate, it quickly settles into a nicely paced tale of this oft-neglected country.<br /><br />I read the story while on a trip to Romania, and had the privilege of passing on the book to an actual Bulgarian woman.  She was so impressed that her history was covered in this fashion.  The joy on her face even surpassed the enjoyment I found between the pages.	2005-08-27

The women have chick-lit, but until recently the men had sparse options.  \\"Billy Goat Hill\\" follows in the steps of Michael Morris' \\"A Place Called Wiregrass,\\" Brad Whittington's \\"Welcome to Fred,\\" and Dale Cramer's \\"Bad Ground.\\"  This is literature, full of carefully rendered characters, memorable settings, and moral lessons that are powerful in their brevity.<br /><br />\\"Billy Goat Hill\\" follows the lives of two brothers growing up in the suburbs of greater Los Angeles.  They are typical boys, mischievous and adventure-seeking.  But they are without a father, and their mother is very withdrawn after the death of their baby brother.  A local policeman becomes a surrogate father of sorts, yet when one of the boys believes himself responsible for an accidental murder, all of their lives will be changed--for good and for bad.<br /><br />Ultimately, Morris' story is one of redemption.  Along the way, he shows the struggles of childhood, and the manner in which these struggles continue into adulthood.  While keeping the story palpable for a Christian audience, Morris also portrays real issues in the lives of boys and men.<br /><br />Although the story drags in a few places and the last third of the book switches quickly, somewhat abruptly into the future, I found the story engrossing.  The endouement paints a clear picture of God's hand and forgiveness in our lives, even through the deceptions of sin and humanity.  Thank God for quality men's literature in this market.  It's about time.	2005-08-26

Even during their ironic and self-mocking gestures of ZooTV and PopMart, I found reasons to remain loyal.  I still maintain that \\"Please\\" and \\"Wake Up, Dead Man\\" (both on the \\"Pop\\" album) are some of the best songs in their impressive catalog.<br /><br />Although Bono has been thrust into the spotlight for over two decades--often by his own choosing--he remains somewhat elusive.  Celebrities and rock stars, for reasons of survival, must maintain a distance of sorts.  This I understand.  But I've wanted more insight, more understanding of the things that motivate U2, and Bono in particular.<br /><br />Michka Assayas has an advantage over other would-be chroniclers of Bono's mindset; Assayas has known the band and followed them from early on.  For this reason, Bono's dialogue throughout the book seems more open, less guarded.  Not only is Bono more candid, but Assayas refuses to be blinded by Bono's star status.  He confronts Bono at times, challenging his thought processes.  Bono, for the most part, comes clean.  Once or twice he holds back.  For all his gestures of honesty, he is still supremely aware of the impact of his words.<br /><br />Despite this, the book is a detailed look into Bono's evolution as a rock star, an activist, and a human being.  His thoughts on faith, old age, and other stars were particularly interesting, and his ideas for helping the poor are examples of his faith in action.  This book may not go deeply into Bono's personal life, but it does delve with great insight into his political, spiritual, and public perceptions.  When it's all said and done, I feel as though I could join him at a local pub and drink pints together while shooting the breeze.<br /><br />Megalomaniac?  Maybe.  Self-proclaimed messiah?  Not quite.  Ambassador of forgiveness and equality?  Absolutely.	2005-08-15

A scary thought.  But, according to Mathieu, a liberating one.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by this small book.  It's a pack of dynamite.  While most of us learn life lessons over a lifetime, Patrick Mathieu was forced to learn quickly the true value of his time, his dreams, and his fears.  Faced with his own impending date with death, he went through anger and frustration.  Then...he discovered lessons that changed everything.<br /><br />\\"What's Your Expiry Date?\\" is a wonderfully written book.  It reads quickly, mixing humor and honesty in potent doses.  We all must face the question of our own mortality.  Mathieu offers his readers a chance to do so--without fear, without regrets, and with a smile as we face our futures.	2005-08-13

He takes the legal thriller and ratchets it into a pure suspense novel, full of believable characters and nail-biting situations.<br /><br />The setting is modern-day Nashville.  Arvin reveals this southern city in a realistic light, never condescending, never kissing up.  Music City has become a true melting pot of nationalities, and we see this clearly through the story of a Sudanese man accused of murder.  Racial tensions build, deceits grow numerous, and pressing legal questions rise to the surface.  Soon the characters are enmeshed in a deadly game that will push them to their limits.<br /><br />The magic of the book is the protagonist.  Tom Dennehy is intelligent, successful, and admired.  But he's also wounded.  His divorce still wears on him, and his anger tends to boil to the surface at inappropriate moments.  As his career and loved ones face threats, he lets himself get involved with a female minister.  Even as the story closes, his soul and his integrity are sitting in the scales.<br /><br />Arvin is a wonderful writer.  His themes are serious and hardhitting, his dialogue is coarse while his prose is picturesque, and the plot is a thing of beauty.  \\"Blood of Angels\\" proves we have a master novelist rising through the ranks.	2005-08-11

This is fantastic fiction from one of the best series going.  Many series start out well, introducing intriguing characters in evocative surroundings, throwing in a mix of crime and mystery to keep us reading.  Inevitably, though, they begin to grow stale--or even worse, formulaic.<br /><br />In his latest mystery, James Lee Burke avoids these pitfalls.  David Robicheaux is still mourning the passing of his wife; he's once again battling his alcoholic tendencies with slipping resolve; and he's dealing with a ghost from his past--this time, a freckle-faced woman from a bygone era in Galveston, TX.  The loose threads of the woman's past cinch tighter as the story progresses, until Robicheaux finds himself facing internal and external threats as dangerous as ever.<br /><br />In my opinion, \\"Jolie Blon's Bounce\\" and \\"Purple Cane Road\\" were stellar installments in the series, whereas \\"Last Car to Elysian Fields\\" didn't hold the same sway.  \\"Crusader's Cross\\" starts off in a whole new setting and goes into previously unexplored corners of Robicheaux's psyche.  I love this series because it's so familiar, and I love it even more because it continues to be fresh.  Burke is flat-out amazing.	2005-08-10

What writer would tackle such an idea?  You have to admire anyone with the courage to make the attempt, but it seems like a disaster waiting to happen.  The religious groups are likely to be offended, while the non-religious are sure to turn an apathetic shoulder.  Of course, the potential for historical and biblical blunders rises like Mt. Ararat in the mind of any novelist.<br /><br />But Maine is not any novelist; he's a talented wordsmith.  \\"The Preservationist\\" walks a tightrope of accuracy and creativity.  No, it dances along that tightrope with irreverent--and sometimes poignantly reverent--abandon.  Maine breathes color into his settings and life into his characters.  He paints Noe's family in realistic hues that leave us catching our breath.  We can relate to these people.  Their struggles are not unlike our own.  They are gritty and real.  Through the jaded and flawed character of Noe, God brings about judgment and redemption.<br /><br />Which brings me to the most astounding accomplishment of \\"The Preservationist\\": It never preaches; it never condescends; it surprises and startles; yet somehow it manages to make God's Word seem viable for the questions and struggles of our present age.<br /><br />On top of that, it's one very entertaining read!	2005-07-21

Then, to remind us of the human element, his words become a microscope, looking deep into our minds and souls.  \\"The Illustrated Man\\" combines these tools with chilling effectiveness.<br /><br />Although Bradbury penned these tales over fifty years ago, they still ring with cautionary truth.  The prologue and epilogue work as bookends, holding in eighteen stories of apocalyptic and visionary wisdom.  Through the moving and shifting tattoos on the illustrated man's back, we see glimpses of the future, full of technology, greed, strife, and the human propensity for selfishness.  Collectively, these tales remind us that our relationships will always supercede our computers and rockets.  When these elements lose perspective, danger lurks in every corner.<br /><br />Although some of the stories seem dated, \\"The Illustrated Man\\" educates while it entertains.  Bradbury is a master of his craft, and this is a masterpiece of science fiction.	2005-07-11

He introduces us to sympathetic characters, then leads us through their dark valleys to reach the glow of redemption.  With his last novel, \\"Bad Ground,\\" he gained respect and high praise from such notable publications as Publishers Weekly--and rightly so.  I counted it as one of my favorite novels of the year.<br /><br />\\"Levi's Will\\" is equally engaging.  I was caught up in the story of young Will Mullet, an Amish kid, who runs away from home to avoid the wrath of his father.  This decision leads him on a path of deception which will cause a decades-long divide between Will and his Amish kin.  Along the way, he sees the evil of WWII and discovers love.  His lies catch up with him, though, resulting in a masterful--and humorous--scene between Will and his wife, a southern woman with a backbone to match his own.<br /><br />The last half of the book feels somewhat inevitable, yet Cramer draws us deeper into the nuances of his characters and the Amish lifestyle, and to his credit he still manages to generate emotional response.  Lessons of love and forgiveness are learned, bridging the hurt of three generations; the hearts of fathers and sons are moved toward eachother; and the hypocrisy of religion is revealed, while the possibility of knowing a personal God is presented as an honor.<br /><br />Once again, Cramer shows us how the lessons of the past still apply today.  His ability to do so through works of fiction is nothing short of miraculous.	2005-06-28

Imagine this novel as a lush, intoxicating sip from the stemware of life.  Then, if you will, imagine him slamming the glass down upon the counter of human vice and evil.<br /><br />Set in Napa Valley, \\"Velocity\\" follows the harrowing story of Billy Wiles.  Billy is a loner.  He has allowed solitude to become his shield against horrors of the past and fears of his future.  Koontz's sparing use of dialogue underlines this sense of loneliness.  Billy's world becomes one of deadly choices when he begins receiving notes from a calculating killer.  As he faces his fears, he also confronts his own secrets and sins--as well as those of others around him.<br /><br />\\"Velocity\\" can be compared to a wine from the same Napa region.  In the first chapter, we get a hint of things to come, a whiff.  Soon, the acids and tannins of the story assault us, overwhelm us--and drag us deeper into a head-swirling story.  We feel the buzz, the rush.  We drink deeper.  Yet, in the hurried last swallow, we realize the finish is not as full as the story first led us to believe.  Koontz races through his final points, seeming to pour down the drain some of the richer textures we thought might reveal themselves.<br /><br />I couldn't put \\"Velocity\\" down.  It was entertaining in every sense of the word.  Only in conclusion did it seem to lose some of its kick.	2005-06-27

With high hopes, I picked up \\"North of Tomorrow.\\"<br /><br />Martinusen crafts a stand-alone story, but for those who've read the previous novels, there is much to find that is familiar and intriguing.  This time around, we view WWII history through the eyes of Amanda, on assignment with a television show.  She is not only fighting for her job, she's fighting to discover the truth of her family's heritage.  What she finds will rock her world and challenge her beliefs.<br /><br />Spliced between Amanda's story, we find scenes with a Mrs. Delsig, an elderly woman with secrets of her own, including information about the long-lost, valuable Empress Brooch.  This is where \\"North of Tomorrow\\" ties in with the previous books, and it makes for some suspenseful moments.  In general, this book has less suspense and less romance than the others, but it creates a moving story of family and generations.  Martinusen handles the different age groups with masterful ease.<br /><br />If you've read Martinusen's \\"Winter Passing\\" and \\"Blue Night,\\" you MUST cap it off with this satisfying wrap-up.  If you haven't, I challenge you to spend some time in the mystery-wrapped stories of this wonderful writer.	2005-06-24

In the hands of Consistent Coben, we find a whole new implication: family relationships, surprise endings and plot twists, suburban settings hiding men's dark deeds.<br /><br />\\"The Innocent\\" follows Matt Hunter, a man bearing the guilt of murder, but trying to start over.  Just as things seem to be settling into normalcy--a new home, a beautiful wife, and a baby on the way--ghosts from his past begin to reimerge.  And, most pressing, he must face questions of his wife's fidelity.<br /><br />Coben's last effort, \\"Just One Look,\\" seemed a bit forced.  He'd thrown us two fantastic speedballs (\\"Tell No One\\" and \\"Gone for Good\\"), and another decent change-up (\\"No Second Chance\\"), but I had to wonder if he was feeling the pressure.  Or, even worse, running out of ideas.  No need to fear.  \\"The Innocent\\" proves that Coben's consistency can be counted on.  Even expecting the twists, I found myself surprised.  Even knowing of his penchant for touching family moments, I was moved by some of the final scenes.  One in particular, between Loren Muse and her mother, was beautifully nuanced.<br /><br />Put Coben on the pitcher's mound and you can count on a winning pitch.  He hasn't lost his touch.  If anything, he's polished up some old tricks and added a few new ones to his repertoire.<br /><br />***Don't bypass the short story at the end of the book.

With promised TV exposure, the portrait could bring long-awaited justice.  Although the story races along, pitting Annie against this desperate man, it is fueled by Annie's internal conflicts--with her son, with God, with her quest for peace.  She is real, likeable, and honest.  We need more of these types of characters in Christian fiction.<br /><br />The story is fast-paced.  One scenario, involving a locked-down house, was particularly effective, using positive and negative sources to ratchet the tension.  One or two reviewers have noted a following coincidence that stretches belief, but I found it realistic in light of similar stories from the actual news.  Maybe a better lead-up or explanation would've satisfied those readers.<br /><br />With Annie Kingston's love life and family situation up for grabs, I'll be looking forward to the next in the series.	2005-06-14

Michael Schiftmann's charismatic, good in bed, and he's formed his real-life violence into the riveting plots of his bestselling mystery series. After years of struggle and poverty, he's signing a huge contract and proposing to the woman who's believed in him from the start.<br /><br />Now he has a problem. After a particularly brutal double murder in Nashville, the FBI has a link the the Alphabet Man. Michael Schiftmann's success will soon face the ultimate test.  After the not-for-the-squeamish first couple of chapters, this turns into a well-paced mystery.  When and how will Schiftmann be caught?  Will they be able to put him away for good?<br /><br />Steven Womack may not tread entirely new ground here, but he does twist and turn the story in unexpected ways. He mixes Thomas Harris and John Grisham, creating psychological and legal twists. Although he fails to answer some of the questions of Schiftmann's childhood, Womack gives us a memorable character to hate. Schiftmann's fiancee, on the other hand, is a woman we can relate to. She loves this talented man. Could the accusations be true?<br /><br />If you're like me, you'll race through this story. Steven Womack, like his fictional character, has written a number of well-received, award-winning mysteries. And yet, he's never had the financial success to match the critical acclaim. This may in fact be the largest mystery here: Why isn't this guy on the bestseller lists? Let's hope this novel solves the mystery by drawing in the large group of fans he deserves.	2005-06-08

In his own words from the book, \\"we still sit here...victims, hoping to be discovered while we suffer.\\"<br /><br />\\"Haunted\\" is all about suffering artists/writers hoping to be discovered.  They will go to any lengths to make their stories known.  They will become the victims or villians to draw the necessary attention.  The media buzz, the spotlights...All they need is enough material for the headlines, and they'll be set for life.  So cut off a toe if it gains some sympathy from the horrified audience.  Tell a story about the parents who tortured you.<br /><br />This book is not for everyone.  Chuck's writing is an acquired taste (some might question the use of that word), and this book is not the best introduction to his work.  I'd suggest \\"Fight Club,\\" \\"Lullaby,\\" or \\"Survivor.\\"  Expect to be horrified and disgusted.  It comes with the territory in Palahniuk land.<br /><br />In his latest, Chuck breaks the book into sections of poems, short stories, and a running commentary of this bedraggled group of writers on retreat.  While I agree with other readers that the short stories provide the best glimpses of Chuck's ability, I am impressed with his cohesive vision for this book.  He juggles the pieces, the characters, the horror, and puts on an entertaining show.  And, as always, he forces us to gasp, to cringe, to laugh...to think.  After the opening chapters, with their form of twisted nausea, I wasn't sure where this book was going or if I wanted to follow.  But I continued.  And I particularly loved the chapters: \\"Slumming,\\" \\"Ambition,\\" \\"Swan Song,\\" \\"Ritual,\\" and \\"Post Production.\\"<br /><br />Palahniuk takes aim at those within his own field of creative genuis, questioning what drives us, what inspires us.  And, with no lost sense of irony, he serves up the very pain and suffering that have made him a household name.  Then, to flip things back on their head, he suggests that forgiveness may be the only way we can rescue the world.<br /><br />So what exactly is he trying to say?  Has he grown soft?  Has he grown more jaded?  Chuck Palahniuk keeps us coming back for more because he never fully reveals the man behind the curtain.  He's more interested in forcing us to face our own faces in the mirror.rescue the world. <br /> <br />So what exactly is he trying to say?  Has he grown soft?  Has he grown more jaded?

Rawles' story takes us much deeper into the same areas.<br /><br />\\"My Jim\\" is sparse, yet powerful.  The writing is raw, yet beautiful.  Nancy Rawles pens a story that sounds as convincing as any I've encountered.  When I read \\"The Bondwoman's Narrative\\" a few years back, I expected a tale with this sort of impact.  Rawles uses subtle symbolism, brevity of words, and universal themes to remind us of the horrors of slavery--whether it be mental, physical, or emotional.  She weaves in the elements of Jim's story without waying down Sadie's.  Love and hope are given moments to sparkle amidst the abuse and suffering of Sadie's life.  Sadie, serving as narrator throughout most of the book, proves that she has stayed strong and true, passing on this hope to a fearful granddaughter.<br /><br />With this short but masterful novel, Rawles does her part to continue the circle of learning.	2005-06-02

Full of honesty and conversational writing, both books renewed my faith in...well, faith.<br /><br />Miller's newest is written in the same deceptionally breezy style.  It is rich with wisdom and insight.  For me, though, it leaned much heavier on theology and apologetics, causing it to lose some of the appeal of \\"Jazz.\\"  Other reviewers have seen this as a strength, crediting the book with deeper ideas and formulated thoughts.  I appreciated these aspects, although they detracted the book's ability to draw me in.  I wanted more of the anecdotes, more of the I-can-relate-to-the-everyday-struggles-of-other-believers moments.<br /><br />Again, Miller shows his incredible ability to communicate on the page.  Again, he reminds us that Christianity is all about a relationship with Jesus, versus a system or set of bullet points.  With less soul than his previous effort, this book still has the ability to revolutionize one's spiritual life.	2005-05-30

Each Sachs story has tackled a historical and spiritual mystery, always something hidden geographically beneath the surface--whether ice fields, lakes, or dirt.  This time, Sachs is not only trying to unravel a mystery, he's trying to save his father's life, which seems inexplicably linked to the strange happenings at an uncharted lake on military property.<br /><br />Gansky is a creative genius, churning out plots worthy of Michael Crichton.  He never delves as deeply into the scientific aspects, but he provides enough details to frame his story, and he brings in the characters to get the job done.  Using elements similar to his own novel \\"Vanished\\" and Crichton's \\"Prey,\\" Gansky explores cutting edge theories that collide with biblical questions.  Due to a large cast of characters, I had a hard time identifying with any one person's conflicts.  Very little character development seemed to occur, and each character seemed equally ready to throw out witty repartee at a moment's notice--to leaven the suspense with some humor.  For me, it became a distraction.<br /><br />Overall, the Perry Sachs novels are my favorite series of Gansky's.  He refuses to submit to dry, rehashed plots.  Instead, he gives us X-File excitement built on Christian principles.  From what I understand, Gansky's now writing full-time, which means more adventures for his many fans.  That's a good thing!	2005-05-12

Even more intriguing, the story is set around the concentration camp in Mauthausen, Austria--a place I've actually visited.<br /><br />Goyer splices together the lives of four individuals.  Jakub is a boy facing life as a prisoner away from his family; Evie is a woman torn from the love of her life and thrust back into the betrayals of Nazism; Nick is the man she loves, a man working as a medic in the war; and Otto is a Nazi with devious plans of his own.  The story weaves back and forth, in and out, bringing these lives together in a suspenseful manner.  Of course, there is a bit of romance thrown in, but not overdone.  The details of the concentration camp are brilliantly conceived, without being too gruesome.<br /><br />All in all, Goyer shows that she is wonderfully talented at telling historical suspense tales with a hint of romance at the heart of them.  I can't wait to read her next one, \\"Dawn of a Thousand Nights.\\"	2005-05-06

After one of his best books, \\"Life Support,\\" I was thrilled to see a sequel.  To be honest, though, I wasn't sure what material he had to work with.  Others may disagree, but I loved the open-ended conclusion of \\"Life Support.\\"<br /><br />Once again, we are pulled into the psychotic world of Rena, a woman living with guilts and secrets.  She begins seeing mysterious visions, and unwinds before our eyes.  Whitlow portrays her with perfection.  Along the way, Alex, her lawyer, begins to look for ways to disengage herself from this nightmarish client, while also looking for ways to build a deeper relationship with Ted Morgan, a Christian music minister.  Their relationship goes through ups and downs, but they are drawn closer as the troubles of Rena's past loom larger.<br /><br />The ending provides some satisfying emotional moments, even if a few of the mystery aspects are wrapped up a bit quickly.  Although the book didn't hold the same sway over me as the first in the Santee Series, it's definitely a must for Whitlow fans.	2005-04-28

The cover and write-up increased my expectations.  Although it sounded a bit like \\"The Oath\\" (probably my favorite Peretti book), I knew it would explore new territory.  I was sure of it.<br /><br />I was right, and I was wrong.<br /><br />The story starts with an eerie attack at night.  The main characters, Beck and Reed, are on a hike that is supposed to challenge them physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  It does all three, but not in the ways they expect.  When Beck is carried off into the darkness by an unknown creature, her husband's emotions are put to the test.  Peretti creates a wonderful opportunity to explore issues of faith in the face of heartache.  Instead, he churns out a fast-paced story that rarely flags, but gives little character development.  In fact, the deepest development goes to his cast of forest-dwelling monsters.  In this aspect, he does a marvelous job.<br /><br />Yes, Peretti tackles the issue of evolution in a creative way.  No, he doesn't give us much to chew on.  Creationist readers will find only one or two arguments on which to hang their hats; evolutionist readers will endure only a stab or two at their foundational thinking.  In other words: You'll see what you want to see.  And maybe that's all Peretti intended.<br /><br />\\"Monster\\" is a very quick read, with lots of entertainment and plenty of scenes for a movie.  Maybe it's only me, but I was still hoping for something more.	2005-04-28

From the start, \\"Company Man\\" had a number of things against it: My time is limited.  500 pages seemed impossible.  The title lacked any hook.  And, having just finished Daniel Silva's superlative \\"Prince of Fire,\\" I feared that anything else would pale in comparison.<br /><br />Seventeen pages into Finder's novel, I'd forgotten about my concerns.  I was hooked, and my interest never flagged.<br /><br />Nick Conover, a beleagured yet successful CEO, finds himself facing turmoil with his adolescent kids; he senses trouble on the business horizon; and, most pressing, he must decide how to deal with a crazed trespasser on his property.  These issues dovetail with beautiful pacing.  All the usual tricks of suspense are at work, but Finder excels with his cast of believable characters.  The dialogue is pitch-perfect.  He manages to go against typecasting and create a warm and intelligent Christian character.  And the interchange between father and children is not only humorous, but heartwrenching and very human.<br /><br />Despite the mundane title, this novel is a page-turner of the first order.  Mixing heartfelt family issues with corporate dirty-dealings, then tossing in some psychotic and criminal behavior, Finder has carved out his own sub-genre in the category of suspense fiction.  Grounded in the business world, he is now the master of the suit-and-die thriller.	2005-04-20

How does an author create memorable characters and unforgettable settings?<br /><br />For answers, we have only to turn to Daniel Silva.  After reading his last two books, both beautifully crafted, I was expecting somewhat of a letdown.  Surely, he couldn't raise the bar yet again.  But I was wrong.  \\"Prince of Fire\\" starts with a bombing in Italy that eventually pulls Gabriel Allon back into action.  Despite his intelligence and abilities, he finds himself little more than a pawn in the hands of his employees--and in the hands of his enemies as well.  He faces issues of loyalty and fidelty with his handicapped wife; he struggles with his own life of violence and revenge; and he tries to understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The results are both moving and nail-biting.<br /><br />With each book in his series following Gabriel Allon (\\"Allon\\" being Hebrew for \\"oak tree,\\" Silva tells us), we find deeper layers to Silva's characters and their conflicts--emotionally, spiritually, and politically.  Perhaps the most impressive thing, however, is the author's economy of words.  He conveys so much with so little.  Like his protagonist, he is an artist, painting in hues full of richness and subtlety.  And in conclusion, Gabriel, like his newest project, \\"Daniel in the Lion's Den,\\" finds himself seeking mental peace while surrounded by strife on all sides.<br /><br />Once again, I'm afraid to read Silva's next book.  How can the man maintain this level of excellence?  I don't know, but I'll be on pins and needles waiting to find out!	2005-04-12

In previous outings, she has reduced me to laughter, tears, and audible gasps.  Here again, she tries to work her charm--and mostly succeeds.<br /><br />It's a joy to read of her parenting travails.  Boy, can I relate.  It's always challenging to read Anne's spirituality-strapped-to-shoe-leather.  She actually thinks that what she believes should change her life--how revolutionary!<br /><br />Somewhere in the mix, though, it starts to sound a bit...well, preachy.  In the nicest sense, of course.  Many reviewers have pointed out her political remarks as part of the loss of charm.  While I don't agree with Anne on every item, I do appreciate her willingness to be honest about her feelings.  She even tries to extend forgiveness to her nemesis, Mr. Bush; but, in light of her later rantings, it's obvious she is still working on it.<br /><br />\\"Plan B...\\" is not a bad one.  It's just not as good as Plan A, otherwise known as \\"Traveling Mercies.\\"  The humor and raw emotion are here, though in lesser quantities.  The writing, as always, lifts it above the level of mediocrity that threatens bookshelves everywhere.	2005-04-06

He can take a big concept, a spiritual truth, a mindboggling reality, and break it down for the reader.  Like some of Dean Koontz's latest thrillers, \\"Obsessed\\" takes an intriguing idea, then adds a heavy dose of mystery and suspense.  By the end, I was left with swirling thoughts and emotions; I was moved outside of my narrow thinking into a world of endless possibility.<br /><br />In \\"Obsessed,\\" Ted follows the story of a young Jewish man as he discovers the falsehoods and the truths that surround his childhood.  He becomes obsessed when he realizes he may hold the key to a boundless fortune, a fortune that has very sentimental links for him.  Splicing WWII scenes into the story, Ted took me on a wild ride.  He captures the terror of the concentration camps, while breathing life and hope into the situation.  Although a few little things tripped me up here and there, I couldn't stop following this amazing tale.  As the two time periods dovetailed, I was thrust into an inevitable, yet still surprising conclusion.<br /><br />And, as he did in \\"When Heaven Weeps,\\" Ted slams down a spiritual concept with his velvet hammer.	2005-04-06

My eyes are always open for the next \\"Into Thin Air\\" or \\"In the Heart of the Sea.\\"  This book, though, does not follow one specific cast of characters through one detailed disaster.  Rather, it outlines numerous such stories, gleaning common tidbits of survival psychology.<br /><br />Why do some live and some die?  What makes a full grown man babble incoherently and slip over the edge of a lifeboat into a group of sharks?  What keeps a young child alive for two nights lost in a snowstorm?  Gonzales deals with everything from survival tips to the power of prayer to emotional strength.  His story is put into gear by an anecdote of his own father's survival in WWII, and grinds to a final halt centered around his coming to terms with his father.  In between, we find numerous case studies of survival.  Most are modern scenarios, pulled from mountaineering, sailing, and climbing.  Some of these you'll be familiar with, while others will be fresh.<br /><br />Gonzales puts his own spin on things, mixing scientific research with evolutionary theory and spirituality.  He delves into the brain's responses to disaster.  He expounds on common elements of most survivors' stories, keys that can be applied to life.  Whether one's facing divorce, financial disaster, or literal life-and-death circumstances, this book offers hope and a call to resilience.<br /><br />\\"Deep Survival\\" never matches the sheer narrative power of \\"The Perfect Storm,\\" but it does break down complex ideas into very manageable bites.  It does provide page-turning suspense.  Ultimately, it shows the author's attempts to understand himself--and that is the key ingredient in each of the survival stories he shares.	2005-03-30

They are headed for a life of slavery to King Zarboff.  What they do not know is that a trunk full of mysterious magic is also being loaded aboard.  This trunk and its contents lead to swashbuckling fights, hints at romance, and the unfolding of the \\"Peter Pan\\" story.  As the ship sets sail, it is eyed by the fearsome Black Stache--whom we all know as Hook.  Soon, Stache and others are pursuing the ship and the magical trunk, with only Peter and a young girl named Molly to stand in their way.<br /><br />My kids and I were wary of starting a 450 page book after having trudged our way through less than 300 pages of \\"Shadowmancer.\\"  Soon, though, we'd forgotten about page count.  We were enthralled by the thrills, chills, and laugh-out-loud moments of \\"Peter and the Starcatchers.\\"<br /><br />We did have one humorous moment that was surely unintentional.  The book, sad to say, is loaded with editorial errors, and one in particular had us chuckling.  On page 318, I read this sentence: \\"Then his arm dropped, limp, staring in astonishment.\\"  I'd sure like to see a limp arm staring at me!<br /><br />Thanks Barry and Pearson for a whimsical prequel to J.M.

The killer, Solomon Long, is rocked by the man's reaction.<br /><br />\\"Forgiving Solomon Long\\" is a story of redemption, couched in the organized crime scene of Kansas City.  At times, it reads with the vivid focus of a comic book; at others, it delves deeply into the wounds that many violent men carry.  We meet Det. Tom Griggs, a man numbed by his job and impotent to change his own marriage.  We journey with \\"Solo\\" through his ugly childhood, his contract-killer career, and his guilt-driven attempts to come clean.  We bump into criminal low-lifes, attractive female cops, and greasy crime lords.<br /><br />In the story's conclusion, most of the pieces come together in  a moving, yet understated manner.  Although the plot thread concerning Solo's mother seems to unravel, the action never flags, and Chris Well stays true to his characters and their inner struggles.  Like a classic comic book (think \\"Spiderman\\" and \\"Batman\\"), this novel is so cleanly drawn that a non-reader could enjoy it, yet so deeply developed that a voracious biblophile can find numerous things to appreciate.<br /><br />In the growing world of Christian fiction, \\"Forgiving Solomon Long\\" proves there is room for new styles, gritty characters, and stories that can move us without sermonizing.

I loved \\"The Secret Life of Bees,\\" but that's the closest I get to anything along these lines.  Mention romance, and I'm instantly suspicious.  I see enough soap operas in my work environment.  Despite these sentiments, I was drawn to this book.  The cover implied something less sappy, and so I dove in--with no regrets.<br /><br />After a meandering beginning, I found myself knowing and caring about the main characters.  In alternating chapters, I watched as Jack and Grace's lives converged.  Jack is a Hollywood hunk.  Grace is a small-town girl, now living near L.A.  Jack deals with substance abuse and relational improprieties.  Grace works through her unfamiliarity around a new set of church friends, as well as her new position as a school teacher.  A believable set of circumstances bring this man and woman together, and the sparks cannot be denied.  Yes, there is romance.  But it was served with dollops of humor.  I was laughing out loud at certain parts.  I loved the dialogue between the characters.  I even felt misty-eyed at one or two points.  (I'll deny I ever wrote this!)<br /><br />Although, as one reviewer has noted, this is indeed Christian fiction, it's Christian fiction which is willing to face life head-on.  It does not shrink away from the temptations and tragedies we all face.  This makes it vastly different from run-of-the-mill religious fare.  \\"Worlds Collide\\" will help you see the stars in a new way, and it will leave you with a sense of Godly destiny even in the midst of heartache.	2005-03-15

When a fateful fire leads to tragedy for Paul's parents, he is sent halfway around the world in an effort to restore his family.  A mystically empowered antique, a chair once owned and used by Leonardo Da Vinci, promises riches and glory--as well as omens of death.  Paul finds himself wrestling with temptations within and without, finally facing the truth of Jesus' teaching via Leonardo's masterpiece, The Last Supper.<br /><br />DeSimone draws interesting characters and visually sumptuous settings.  I enjoyed the journeys of Paul and his mother, in particular.  Paul's father, Vincent, (mysteriously referred to as \\"Victor\\" on the back cover) was less well defined.  My only real complaint, though, was the lack of surprise in the climactic scenes.  Nevertheless, DeSimone leaves plenty of room for a great sequel.  This is a series worth latching onto.	2005-03-07

When he does give the story a twist here or there, he does so with fair warning: \\"What looks tragic might be comic on second consideration, and what is comic might bring tears in time.\\"<br /><br />The story follows Jimmy Tock, a biggish man with a humble disposition and prophetic warnings hanging over his head.  Five specific dates in his life will be terrible, so his grandfather claimed.  And Jimmy's life builds toward each date with an impending sense of doom.  Along the way, he discovers the meaning of love and family, of revenge and forgiveness.  He realizes that one's life expectancy is about much more than how long they breathe air on this earth.<br /><br />After a slow start, this book gained speed quickly.  I raced through the five prophetic dates in Jimmy's life, coming to care about his predicament.  Koontz builds his characters deftly, using humor and quirky dialogue along the way.  When the story's final surprises came to light, I was surprised, but without feeling cheated.  Once again, the Koontz-meister had worked his magic in this unique and memorable tale.	2005-02-24

It's like falling in love.<br /><br />\\"Blue Like Jazz\\" was similar to an entire album of great tunes.  Each scene, each chapter, made me want to go back and reread.  I wanted to savor every bit of grace and wisdom.  But then, I wanted also to rush to the next scene.  Miller is self-deprecating without sounding whiny.  He's witty and intelligent without sounding smug or aloof.  And, most importantly, he gets to the real heart of Christianity.  He peels back the noise of life and temptation and religion so that we can hear the purest notes of Jesus' love.<br /><br />I've grown up in church.  I've seen it all--the good and bad, the hypocrisy and grace, the religion and the reality.  Donald Miller touches on all these things, bringing encouragement for those of us who are sick of \\"churchiness,\\" bringing hope and fresh air to those who've wanted to know Jesus without all the trappings of religion.  Sure, there are a few moments that seem simplistic.  Haven't we had enough confusion, though?<br /><br />\\"Blue Like Jazz\\" is a tune I'd like to spin again through my reading repertoire.	2005-02-22

He did so in \\"Yucatan Deep\\" and in \\"Turn Four.\\"  He's the Clive Cussler of the Christian market, churning out testosterone-driven adventures with strong spiritual themes.<br /><br />This time, we meet a new hero in Beck Easton.  Nosy young Jennifer Cassidy, a university graduate, drags Beck from his Florida diving business, to the Bahamas, then up the Great Lakes.  The goal: to track a lost fortune in gold.  But not all is as it seems.  Soon history and mystery collide, with Beck and Jennifer risking their lives to uncoer the truth.<br /><br />\\"Deep Blue\\" has some good twists, some memorable locations, and great \\"what ifs.\\"  I raced from beginning to end, curious as to the fortune's true nature.  I appreciated Jennifer's spiritual struggles.  Although Beck is likeable enough, he's harder to relate to because of his \\"Incredible Hulk\\" physique, his fortitude in the face of any temptation, and his seemingly endless repertoire of knowledge.  No matter what situation he's in, he knows just what to do because he's done it before...flying, diving, espionage, etc.<br /><br />Morrisey combines the adventure of \\"Yucatan Deep\\" with the spirituality of \\"Turn Four\\", throws in his most flawed character yet in Jennifer Cassidy, and offers up his best thriller yet.	2005-02-20

The book's central character, Mark Cloud, is a northern kid, stuck in eastern Texas, carrying the burden of being a pastor's son.  He's disdained by Deacon Fry, he's shunned by the local hooligans, and he's buddies with a suspected murderer.  That's not enough?  He's also smart, funny, spiritual, and someone we can all relate to in some way.  He wants to fit in.  He wants to know God's will.  He doesn't always get the girl--but then again...<br /><br />\\"Living with Fred\\" teased smiles and tears from my face, but, mostly, it got me laughing.  It's a book to savor, a book to speed through.  Underline your favorite parts, memorize your favorite lines, but don't pass it by.  Brad Whittington has more stories to tell, and Mark Cloud will be back in book three.<br /><br />That's good news ya'll.	2005-02-14

What you do not know is that ancient evils--and an ancient hero--are about to clash in a cataclysmic way within the abbey's storm-battered walls.<br /><br />Huggins knows how to tell a fast-paced tale.  He's proven that in books such as \\"Cain\\" and \\"Leviathan.\\"  In his best book, \\"Rora,\\" he mixed history, spirituality, and suspense seamlessly.  Along the way, though, his increasingly gritty style has alienated some of his readers of faith.<br /><br />\\"Nightbringer\\" is a return to Huggins' earlier, cleaner style, while bringing with it all the great storytelling he has honed.  Although the childrens' personalities are never explored, and the mother's career is conveniently apropos and unexplained, the book is a wonderful thriller based on a spiritual battle.  Huggins throws in his military tactics and knowledge.  But he also leads up to a satisfying exploration of faith in the face of overwhelming odds.<br /><br />If you like atmospheric stories and bone-crunching verbs, you'll love \\"Nightbringer.\\"  It's Huggins at his best.	2005-01-24

Does modern science intentionally mislead the masses and/or does the media play things up to keep us tuning in?  These are themes at the heart of Crichton's newest novel.  Some accuse him of pedantic posturing.  Some say he should write a tract instead of a novel.  But since when has fiction been given only to entertainment?  Those who credit it for nothing more have missed the point of some of the world's greatest novels.<br /><br />And honestly, has Crichton ever written a novel without an underlying warning or theme?  No.  He's a man bent on entertaining us while slipping in cautionary messages about our technology and culture.<br /><br />\\"State of Fear\\" is a fast-paced story that leans heavily on its themes, while still keeping our attention.  Sure, some things are overdone.  Other scenes stretch credulity.  But I closed the last page with lots to mull over.  Yes, we are a society run, in so many ways, by fear.  Thanks, Michael, for reminding us to never rely blindly on others who throw out theories as well established facts.	2005-01-15

He sermonizes and prattles on, but he has a lot to say.  With a premise as ingenious and outlandish as this--WWII America under the control of anti-Semitic Charles Lindbergh--I couldn't resist diving into this story.<br /><br />From the beginning, Roth tells his tale like an autobiographical coming-of-age story.  He uses his own name for the central character.  He provides details with laborious thoroughness, yet it adds to the richness of his conceived fascist America.  As the plot moves along, this Jewish family's division is rendered with marvelous nuances.  I loved the scenes in Washington D.C.  I thought the introduction of Just Folks and the Homestead act were brilliant.  This could happen.  This is how it could happen.  The book had me hooked.<br /><br />And then, the unthinkable...a plot twist that seemed so preposterous that I felt cheated by a would-be classic.  I would've bought into it had it been foreshadowed better.  Or, if a better explanation were later given.  Instead, we are offered only theories which seem ridiculous by any measure.  Yes, truth can be stranger than fiction.  In this case, however, it seemed like a cheap way to resolve the building drama of a far-ranging conflict.  If the story had ended with a country in crisis, it may have left me contemplating the what-ifs: what if we refuse to accept others?  what if we turn a blind eye to ignorance and intolerance?  Instead, I was left longing for some tolerance on the author's part.  Why couldn't he portray at least one \\"Christian\\" character as having some understanding, for example?  With a powerful message against racism and prejudice, Roth remains myopic, never mentioning the violence that would be perpetrated against other minority groups, such as blacks and gays.  Sure, his tale is told through the eyes of a child, but his child becomes a wise narrator at numerous intersections, providing social and political commentary.<br /><br />To thus ignore the plight of others seemed unjust.  To pull a final trick on the reader seemed unfair in the extreme.. <br /> <br />To thus ignore the plight of others seemed unjust.

Now, having given the book a chance, I can assure you...this is no Dan Brown thriller.  One reviewer also called it a coming-of-age story, but, compared to classic literature, it falls short on that count as well.<br /><br />It does succeed, however--on a number of levels.  \\"The Rule of Four\\" reminded me more of \\"The Emperor of Ocean Park.\\"  It is full of mystery, family secrets, friendships, and betrayal.  The build-up is slow and satisfying.  In this case, a centuries-old secret has pried at the seams of many minds and relationships.  A group of Princeton staff and students have become enmeshed in the secret's snare, and the results will be deadly for some.  As the story builds to its conclusion, it satisfies and teases simultaneously.  We don't feel cheated.  But we're left with somewhat empty hands.<br /><br />Caldwell's prose isn't snappy like Brown's; it's much more contemplative and full of beauty.  It contains wisdom and insights.  Sometimes it tries too hard.  But at least it tries.  Set aside lofty literary expectations and hopes of heart-pounding suspense, and read \\"The Rule of Four\\" for what it is--a fairly competent mix of the two.	2004-12-27

Much closer, but still inadequate.  So where does \\"Shadowmancer\\" go wrong?  Why all the bad reviews?<br /><br />Drawn in by the marketing, I read this book with my daughters.  We did find it to be in line with Biblical teachings, but we found little else to become attached to.  We dragged through it.  My girls had to be convinced to sit down for \\"reading time.\\"  (Already they're begging for more of \\"Peter and the Starcatchers.\\")  I was struck by the use of repetitive phrases--\\"over and over,\\" \\"faster and faster,\\" \\"round and round.\\"  I was annoyed by the switches between point of view.  Mostly, I just wanted some good reasons to care about the characters and believe the story was building toward something worthwhile.  Instead, it meandered around toward a conclusion that had nothing to do with the characters' development and everything to do with angelic beings showing up at the necessary moments.<br /><br />If you want an alternative to Harry Potter, this qualifies.  But it doesn't qualify as great writing, gifted plotting, or entertaining storytelling.  We'll be skipping book two.	2004-12-27

Accuracy, intrigue, interesting characters...These are a few of the components necessary to make such an endeavor soar.  Jack Higgins, Daniel Silva, and Len Deighton are authors who have made this work.<br /><br />Does Berry's novel succeed at the same level?  Frankly, no.  While he comes up with an interesting premise--an heir to the Tsars brought forward as a new Russian leader, based upon Rasputin prophecies--he doesn't always keep the action as interesting.  Some reviewers have criticized the credibility of the Tsar idea, but, having traveled in Russia, I think it has much more substance than one might suppose.  What makes it seem less so are the numerous scenes in which we, the readers, must stretch our incredulity to the limits.  I was willing to go along with the creative scenario at a zoo in San Francisco--I even admired Berry's daring.  Unfortunately, the saving efforts of a borzoi hound (three times, no less!), and the misplaced and unsubstantiated trust between our guileless hero and his traitorous boss, made it hard for me to buy into the story.<br /><br />If you're looking for escapist fiction with some tidbits of historical interest, \\"The Romanov Prophecy\\" might satisfy you.  I did enjoy the story overall.  But don't come expecting the authenticity of Len Deighton's \\"SS-GB\\" or the hard-edged action of Jack Higgins \\"The Eagle Has Landed.\\"	2004-12-17

I'd heard great things about Brandilyn Collins and liked this book's title, but the cover threw me off.  (Don't ask, just a personal thing, I guess.)  Overcoming my doubts, I picked up \\"Brink of Death\\" and realized I'd been missing out on quite a treat.<br /><br />The story follows a single mother thrown into a threatening situation.  Not only must she deal with her doubts as a mother and ex-wife, she must also deal with her father's legacy and the secrets he protected.  The secrets refuse to lie dormant, so that soon she is forced to confront a deadly foe.<br /><br />Collins tells of believable characters in mysterious and threatening situations.  She doesn't shy from violence, but it's never gratuitous.  She gives spiritual truth without hitting us over the head with it.  I was on the edge of my seat more than once.<br /><br />My friends were right about Collins' books.  I've already added her next in the series to my wish list.	2004-12-09

Stanton Mystery Series #3)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Questions Raised	Gansky is consistent, providing us fast-paced, imaginative stories with engaging characters.  Sometimes, I stumble over a point of implausibility, but I'm still happy to have taken the journey.<br /><br />In \\"Out of Time,\\" I was caught up quickly.  J.D. Stanton is on a catamaran in the Atlantic, helping out five disenchanted navy kids by giving them some fresh air and a change of view.  Problems arise with a freak storm and the appearance of a British warship--a dreadnought from the early 1900s!<br /><br />Although the encounter with the HMS Archer doesn't happen until half way through the story, I raced through the book.  The pacing is handled well, and the questions are raised to create suspense.  A few of these questions, unfortunately, are left unanswered.  What event actually caused the connection between past and present, for example?  We are left to fill in the pieces ourselves.<br /><br />Like \\"Beneath the Ice,\\" this book is satisfactory on many levels.  Gansky likes to think outside the box.  I'll look forward to his next thriller.	2004-12-01

Nicholas Sparks made a million dollars off his first novel, \\"The Notebook.\\"  His books have been made into movies.  Some might say he lives the charmed life.  So why should we care that he got to travel around the world with his brother?  Who wants to read about spoiled rich people and their international trots?<br /><br />This book will convince you to look at others through a new set of glasses.  Not only does \\"Nicky\\" reveal the wonders and shortfalls of cultures from Cambodia to Easter Island to Norway, he also shows us the heartbreak of his own family.  Without revealing all, let me say that he tells a readable tale of his own childhood, spliced in with scenes of his three week journey with his brother.  At times, the story is laugh-out loud funny; at others, it is sobering and poignant.<br /><br />Yes, I may have harbored a bit of envy for Mr. Sparks' \\"charmed life.\\"  Now I harbor feelings of admiration, compassion, and brotherhood.  Thank you, Nick, for opening your heart and your life to encourage those of us traveling the same path.	2004-11-26

They tend to become trite, maudlin, contrived.  Mackel's novel tries very hard to avoid these mistakes--and succeeds for the most part.<br /><br />When told that \\"The Surrogate\\" contained some supernatural suspense, I grew interested and decided to give it a shot.  Within twenty pages, I was hooked.  The first half of the book kept me intrigued as I waited for the showdown between the shady, but sympathetic surrogate, and the downtrodden Christian parents.  Once some of these questions were dealt with, I had a harder time maintaining interest.  I also struggled with the plausibility of one or two items--particularly one regarding a baby's cries.<br /><br />But in the last 75 pages or so, the story kicked into gear again and raced to a conclusion which drew together the themes of motherhood, song, and God's sovereignty in our lives.  I enjoyed Mackel's writing, and I look forward to her next thriller.	2004-11-26

Alafair could be accused of sneaking into the industry with her father's credentials, or of trying to emulate her father's style.<br /><br />The accusations would be off by a long shot.<br /><br />With \\"Missing Justice,\\" Alafair establishes herself as a worthy mystery writer.  A one-of-a-kind.  Her protagonist, Samantha Kincaid, gets caught up in her second mystery; this one revolves around a missing judge and the web of politics, money, and personal motives behind the judge's disappearance.<br /><br />Alafair's first Kincaid novel, \\"Judgement Calls,\\" was good, but had its bumpy spots.  Here and there, it felt a bit forced.  \\"Missing Justice\\" is a marked step above, bringing Samantha Kincaid into the forefront of female protagonists.  This character is smart, charming, flawed, and tough-as-nails.  If I became infatuated with fictional characters, I might do so with Sam.<br /><br />Way to go, Alafair.  The plot moves, the twists keep coming, and Samantha refuses to let us stop reading.  I can't wait for book three!	2004-11-20

The scholars who are so adept at the required research are often forgettable storytellers.<br /><br />Kurson joins the ranks of the classic adventure accounts.  His writing sparkles with facts and emotion, as he takes us from the initial discovery of a lost WWII U-boat to its eventual, history-making identification.  At times I laughed out loud, got tears in my eyes, or held my breath.  He brings to life the divers who searched out this mystery, as well as the sea and the ships that lie deep in its cold belly.<br /><br />\\"Shadow Divers\\" could have been a dry distillation of information.  In Kurson's sure narrative, it becomes a living, breathing story of men pushed to their limits, of history rewritten, of folly and courage and the fine line that distinguishes them.  I highly recommend this book.	2004-11-06

He's also had a few misses, by my reckoning.  But I can't stop reading his elegant prose and unique blend of dialogue.  He never fails to transport me into a world far from my daily routine.<br /><br />\\"In the Moon of Red Ponies\\" succeeds on many levels.  Burke takes us deeper into Billy Bob Holland's head, as well as taking us deeper into the thinking of \\"reformed\\" criminals, such as Wyatt Dixon.  He makes us care about a wayward Indian and his white girlfriend.  He brings the startling beauty of Montana into focus.<br /><br />He also turns political on us.  He never brings us to believe fully in Holland's legal career.  And, as he did in his last Robicheaux book, he transitions into a new situation for his protaganist without letting us experience the transition.  For me, this is always a bit jarring.<br /><br />Once again, Burke is at the top of his narrative form.  And I, personally, don't begrudge him the desire to actually stand for something he believes in through the course of his tale.  I don't have to agree, but I do love his moral ponderings.  I'm a Burke fan for life--which means I'll love him for his strengths and his idiosyncracies!	2004-10-19

I couldn't wait to read more about the quirky town of Skary, Indiana.<br /><br />Once again, Gutteridge throws us into a quaint and strange little place, full of quaint and strange little people.  Ainsley Parker and Wolfe Boone are looking forward to their upcoming nuptials; a mysterious doctor has arrived in town; owls and cats and clone-like figures are prowling the darkness; and overweight Melb is trying to prepare herself for life with Oliver.  The characters are memorable, sympathetic, and humorous.  It's as though the Munsters moved into Mayberry.  At times, the story will have you laughing; other times, it'll glue you to your seat.<br /><br />The true triumph of \\"Boo Who\\" is that it doesn't feel like a forced sequel, produced for sales quotes.  It has an engaging plot that leads naturally from the first book, while still standing on its own two legs.  It deals with the identity crises of a town and it's inhabitants.  And it leaves room for another in the series--with a rumored title of \\"Boo Hiss.\\"<br /><br />I'll be adding it to my wish list.	2004-10-15

Look at \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" and \\"Fight Club.\\"  A point can be made without pounding it into the ground.<br /><br />Max Barry's concept is straightforward.  Capitalizm has become the new form of social structure, even dictating a person's last name (ie. John Nike).  And, in the pursuit of money, some corporations are willing to kill even children to further their goals.  Barry's first 100 pages fly by, introducing a world turned upside down, yet filled with relatable people.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the concept stumbles under its own weight.  What seems fresh at first becomes tired by the end.  My hat is off to Barry for tackling globalization with such verve, and for still painting believable characters.  He fails, however, to paint any \\"place\\" or \\"setting.\\"  It all feels the same, except for a scene or two with NRA trainees in the woods.  This lack of environment and atmosphere left me apathetic about the world these characters were fighting for.  After the dust clears, I hope we have more than stainless steel and concete.<br /><br />Although \\"Jennifer Government\\" reads quickly, it is unable to maintain the manic or creative elements of a Palahnuik novel.  Still, Barry does employ some nice irony and poetic justice near the end, and I have to recommend the book overall.	2004-10-02

When his company is gobbled up by a huge industry leader, he fears his corporate days are numbered.  To his surprise, he ends up on a highly personal search for the industry leader's daughter.  Is he being used as a pawn in a much larger game?  He has his suspicions, but with money forced into his hands and killers on his tail, he chases after his former love.<br /><br />The back cover seems to imply a more medically minded thriller, but this book is set in much grittier places--the wild surf of France and Scotland, the highlands of the Basque country, and the belly of an old fortress.  It is really a story of one man's healing.  Toward the end, it seems rushed.  It also tacks on a somewhat unbelievable faith element in the middle of a Wall Street Journal article.<br /><br />Overall, though, \\"Elixir\\" proves that Bunn is one of our reigning novelists when it comes to evocative description and character development.  Some of these scenes won't be easily forgotten, and Taylor Knox and associates will stay with you after you close the last page.	2004-09-14

In \\"Turn Four,\\" he takes us into the exciting sport of auto racing.  Although I've never been a NASCAR fan, he drew me in with his heart-pumping narrative and fact-filled descriptions.  He made me care about his racecar drivers.<br /><br />The story follows Chance Reynolds, a highly successful driver, who finds himself cut off from the career he's long pursued.  He must deal with spiritual, financial, and relational questions.  Along the way, he helps other beleagured families in the world of racing.<br /><br />The story leans heavily on sermonizing dialogue.  Although I believe the things Morrisey expresses, I had a difficult time feeling much sympathy for his main character.  The guy has talent, money, a wife who loses every extra pound soon after giving birth, a supportive family, an adoring racing world, and very few personal weaknesses.  While I know people like this must exist, they tend to come across picture perfect, even too good to be true, in the world of fiction.<br /><br />That said, Morrisey does a great job with his exploration of the Christian male mindset. We need more of this type of storytelling, but, maybe, a little less of the preaching.  Will his next book center around climbing, sky-diving, skiing, or...?  I can't wait to find out.	2004-09-02

In this, my first taste of his prose, I discovered bitter sorrow, sweet redemption, and tidbits of wisdom with dashes of humor.<br /><br />\\"Bad Ground\\" begins with an orphaned teenager named Jeremy.  He has his share of scars, but he holds onto an innocent faith in God.  This faith is tried and tested when he ends up living and working with his uncle Aiden.  Aiden, otherwise known as Snake, leads a crew of miners outside of Atlanta.  He's a morose man laboring under guilt and physical deformities.<br /><br />Cramer fills his story with memorable characters, believable dialogue, and situations that defy description in this review.  I was laughing out loud at points, wiping a tear from my eye at others.<br /><br />Like \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" or \\"Gap Creek,\\" this story contains many riches wrapped around spiritual themes.  Written with grace, \\"Bad Ground\\" demands to be read by the masses.	2004-08-30

The reviews here are numerous, conflicting, and passionate.  In fact, I hesitated to invest the time to read the book, based on the thoughts expressed on this site.  I'm glad I overcame my doubts.  Some of the best lines and paragraphs of Koontz's career make appearances here...And I'll tell you up front: I'm a sucker for literary art.<br /><br />Is Koontz stealing ideas, though?  Is he running dry on imagination, as some seem to imply?  I think not.  Yes, he takes alien themes--even calling his creatures ETs at points--but he wishes to turn the Hollywood stereotypes on their heads.  He tried to do a similar thing in \\"Odd Thomas.\\"  In both of these latest thrillers, he tries to tap our pop culture's common denominators and open our eyes to new interpretations.<br /><br />Is he becoming preachy, with a timeworn agenda?  The answer here is obvious.  Yes, Koontz wants to say something.  (What writer doesn't?)  He appeals to the human heart; he addresses the ills of our modern times; he attempts to provide a spiritual resolution of sorts, without offending or pleasing any particular faith.<br /><br />Back to the first questions posed...Yes, I think this is one of Koontz's best.  A simple, but bewildering tale told with luminescent prose and heart-pumping suspense.  And it may be one of his worst.  He gives very little character development beyond a major attribute for each of his protagonists to guard, and he sums up the ending like a quickly penned tract against cultural evil.<br /><br />In the end, though, I am thankful for a writer who still loves our language, still loves the idea of goodness and light, still tells a story aimed for our heads and our hearts--not just our pocketbooks.	2004-08-22

They loved Kale and her quest.  We laughed at some of the characters' antics, wished for cute little dragons as pets, and raced through the confrontations with natural and unnatural foes.<br /><br />The story starts with Kale as a young slave girl.  Slowly she discovers she is more than a slave girl; she is a woman destined for great things.  As she searches for the fabled meech egg, she accepts the role that is hers and she makes many new friends along the way.  \\"Dragonspell\\" implies more contact with dragons, and indeed dragons are an important part of the background, as well as a driving factor in Kale's quest.  But my daughters and I all hoped for a little more of the dragon scenes.  We especially had a soft spot for Celisse.  I'm sure dragons will be explored more in the sequel.<br /><br />Paul's writing is full of imagery and world-building.  The allegorical aspects are clear, but never heavyhanded.  Christian themes ring true.  Most of this fantasy land will seem somewhat familiar to avid readers, yet it still pulses with a life and imagination all its own.  The names are fun and evocative.  The characters are many, but memorable.<br /><br />This is one family who will be waiting anxiously for the next in Donita Paul's series.	2004-08-21

In the past, she's woven thoughtful suspense stories around WWII secrets; she's crafted characters we care for and can't forget.  Here, in \\"The Salt Garden,\\" she tries a different angle--with remarkable results.<br /><br />Less overtly suspenseful, yet full of mystery and secrets, this book takes us into the hearts and minds of three women--a modern, frustrated reporter; a reclusive, elderly novelist; and a deceased journal writer.  The threads of these women's stories intertwine, then pull tighter and tighter as more facts come to light.  The pages are filled with beautiful imagery and thought-provoking introspection.  Martinusen shows her skill, letting each character have a voice distinctly her own.<br /><br />I believe Cindy Martinusen has many more tales to tell.  Her heart for God, her struggle with the issues of life, and her honesty in the midst of it all lend weight to her words and emotion to each of her stories.  More readers should take notice!	2004-08-15

I am drawn, however, to WWII stories. I lived in Austria for a time, and I've visited Matthausen concentration camp with my wife. With that in mind, I couldn't resist checking out &quot;From Ashes and Dust.&quot;<br /><br /> The story brings together an assortment of characters caught in the aftermath of Hitler's terror. Peter is an American, disturbed by the conditions within the concentration camps. Michaela is a survivor from Poland. Helene is a woman torn by her husband's brutal actions as an SS officer. And Arno is her husband's fellow conspirator, a conniving man with a treasure to uncover. The pace never flags as these lives come together and pull apart. Although God's redemption is central, the story doesn't come across as melodramatic or simplistic. It honors those who lived through the horror of those days.<br /><br /> Once again, I'm glad I overcame my silly prejudices. Tricia Goyer writes a wonderful story of pain and evil coming face to face with forgiveness and hope. The WWII veterans' endorsement of this tale encouraged me to read on--rightfully so. The historical and geographical details are rendered with care. Yes, there is some romance, but it is woven into the tragedies of the day and never seems forced.<br /><br /> From the ashes of war, Goyer crafts a wise and entertaining story. I look forward to her next effort.	2004-08-06

Nick studies bugs. He loves insects. And, with his unusual knowledge, he's able to extract valuable clues from corpses and cow-patties.<br /><br /> Yes, this is some strange stuff. How can you not enjoy such well-done, quirky fiction? The Bug Man, once again, leads us into an urban mystery. This time, a growing corporation gets its hand stuck in the criminal cookie jar. Their altruistic goals become justifications for very naughty organ-harvesting. Although the subject is gruesome, Downs keep a light touch. His characters keep us laughing. Meanwhile, we are faced with serious issues of our modern age.<br /><br /> &quot;Chop Shop&quot; is more than a tale of murder and mayhem, more than a treatise on medical ethics; it is a study in human motivation. Nick's budding romance with Riley clashes with his mother's good intentions and his own disturbed childhood. When the final surprises are brought to light, we're convinced they could happen--even if we wish they didn't.<br /><br /> For those looking for preachy fiction, you've come to the wrong place. The Bug Man gives very faint references to Christianity. On the other hand, the ethics and values here are straight forward and to be admired. This is one of the best mystery series going, bar none. The only problem: we have to wait another year for a third book...and, like one of Polchak's mosquito friends, this sucks!	2004-08-03

I appreciate the message, but I don't always like the tactics, the style, the flash, and the glossing over of life's difficulties. If someone expects me to get excited, I tend to do the opposite.<br /><br /> Along comes Larry Hehn. He sends me an email and asks if I'd be interested in the book. I warn him that I'll be honest. I tell him I'm not a fan of this sort of thing. Nevertheless, I agree to give it a shot.<br /><br /> Hehn is more than a motivational writer. He's a storyteller, an encourager, a realist and an optimist. I sped through the book, uncovering gems of wisdom, pearls of truth, and lodes of laughter. I didn't want to appreciate the book as much as I did. Hehn convinced me, though, he has something worth saying and he's more than capable of presenting it in an easygoing style.<br /><br /> If you're in search of a mentor, if you're ready to get off your duff and pursue your goals and dreams, then pick up this book and &quot;Get the Prize.&quot;	2004-07-30

What if you could not be killed?  What if death had no hold on you?<br />Mark Andrew Olsen approaches this idea in a fresh way, and, in the process, gives us a suspenseful story with theological implications.  The book opens with a group of old priests, a secretive Catholic order, who have been digging ceaselessly in their search for their immortal ward.  The man they seek is one who has walked the earth for two millenia, living countless lives, and working as the one of who will restrain the spirit of the anti-Christ in godless times.<br />The story breaks open when this man is found, at last--buried alive in a Nazi tomb near Auchwitz.  The havoc that ensues could've turned Hollywood-ish.  At times, it does rely on gunfights and nick-of-time escapes.  But the real accomplishment here, the beating heart of the story, is Olsen's ability to take us into the mind of his immortal character.  We care about this man.  We believe in his struggle.  We feel at times that his struggle is the same one we face, daily trying to follow God despite our sense of hopelessness and uselessness in this fallen world.<br />Publishers Weekly accused the book of tiresome and confusing viewpoints, but I found the plot easy to follow.  Even more importantly, I thought the characters were easy to sympathize with.  Although the ingredients of the story seemed to promise more suspense in the finale, \\"The Assignment\\" is worth the effort.  Without being preachy, Olsen reminds us that life is worth living--and that dying is nothing to fear when we are part of God's family.	2004-07-16

Pleasing, but not entirely satisfying, it lacked a certain richness.  Meant to whet our appetites, it was preparing us for something greater.<br />&quot;Red&quot; is the meal.  Ted Dekker expands upon his concepts and worlds, entertaining us, spinning a great story, and serving up substance with style.  The dream-like world of Thomas Hunter takes on weight--it becomes more real.  In the &quot;real&quot; world, the spreading virus and its global threat become parallels for the actual battle playing out on another plane.  A spiritual plane.  A plane with very real consequences.<br />As in the first book, we don't get much inner character conflict or change.  For me, this can lead to disappointment.  But Dekker aims for a larger, symbolic conflict--the struggle of the human soul between darkness and light, between death and life.  In this, he succeeds wildly.<br />I've had my appetizer and my entree...Now I'm waiting for dessert!	2004-06-26

Mixing elements of Thomas Harris, Jonathan Kellerman, and Harlan Coben, he shows that even tried and true formulas can be given new life.<br />&quot;The Hundredth Man&quot; follows two detectives, Carson and Harry--both memorable and likeable--as they try to unravel the clues behind a spree of murders.  Each of the victims, found headless, provides further info that will eventually lead the detectives to the killer's twisted and horrific motives.  Along the way, human beings are seen in all their warmth and in all their bitter coldness.  A woman wrestles with her own alcohol demons, and a child-abused inmate toys with the minds of the detectives.  Amidst the plot's dark elements, Kerley sprinkles insights without coming across heavy-handed.<br />&quot;The Hundredth Man&quot; has not only a gripping story, but engaging characters and snappy dialogue to counter the gruesome aspects of autopsies, beheading, and psychological/physical abuse.  Is it a sobering read?  Yes.  Does Kerley manage to lend it a fresh breath of humanity?  Absolutely.  We can only hope that more stories are on their way.	2004-06-22

The story, though, is told with imagination and insight.<br />Jonas Swazool is the engaging protagonist.  He draws caricatures on the boardwalk of a California beach town, fancying himself as a Bohemian loner.  Jonas provides necessary touches of humor for this dark morality tale.  When he agrees to a suspicious money-making scheme, he finds himself involved in an alien invasion by an ancient evil.  What seems to be a local and minor problem soon escalates into a society-threatening force led by greed.<br />&quot;Touched by Choi&quot; is a difficult story to define.  Imagine a twisted rendition of &quot;The Midas Touch,&quot; and a contemporary retelling of &quot;Animal Farm,&quot; then add elements of suspense, sci-fi, and mystery, and you will come close to capturing its essence.  The author throws in a final surprise or two, but never lets us forget that greed and human avarice will lead to ultimate downfall.<br />With an original idea and a memorable protagonist, this book deserves to be read and discussed.	2004-06-21

I've refused to give up on this fictional relationship, and the rewards are beginning to become apparent.<br />No, I don't claim that &quot;Bitterroot&quot; is the best Burke book out there.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of &quot;Jolie Blon's Bounce,&quot; &quot;Purple Cane Road,&quot; and &quot;In the Electric Mist With Confederate Dead.&quot;  I must admit, however, that the setting of Montana is beginning to etch itself into my mind.  Or rather, Burke is beginning to etch it there.<br />With careful descriptions and poetic phrases, James Lee Burke has spun his tale and added depth to his recurring characters.  Although evil and violence abound, he provides a moral anchor in his narrative.  He portrays racism, elitism, ignorance, and sadism, yet assures us that the world will not go to the dogs without a good fight from his heros and heroines--no matter how flawed they might be.  With this in mind, I plunked down my money today for the latest Billy Bob saga, &quot;In the Moon of Red Ponies.&quot;	2004-06-20

I welcomed the fresh touch and witty insights of the story.<br />Just in time for summer, Blackston serves up a second helping of relational gumbo.  The novel may appear to be Christian dating ala mode, but it aims to be much more.  This time, Jay remains in the jungles of Ecuador, while his friend and teacher, Neil, accepts a challenge to spend his own furlough in the tangled web of S. Carolina's singles scene.  Along the way, he meets new friends, potential flames, and fresh insight into God's working in every aspect of his life.<br />Fans of the first book will enjoy visiting again with Darcy and Alexis.  They'll enjoy the brief moments on a fishing boat, and the more stretching experiences of jungle work.  Although the narrative seems to try too hard in some places, it's always fun and warm.  Don't be surprised if you laugh out loud in spots.  Don't be shocked if it lifts your spirits along the way.	2004-06-20

Certain authors are weak in the writing department, yet they do a wonderful job of telling stories and communicating truth.  Others are masters in the art of literature, but they fail to touch us on a heart level.  Buchanan mixes sparkling words with piercing insight, and delivers a book that should be read by all.<br />&quot;The Holy Wild&quot; is a book for anyone who has struggled with the questions of life.  It doesn't turn its eyes from the ugliness of disease or disaster; it doesn't candy-coat the realities of abuse and addiction.  It does, however, nudge us into the presence of the living God, reminding us to view life through his majesty, his justice, and his grace.<br />With the theological depth of CS Lewis and the storytelling ease of John Eldredge, Mark Buchanan is a voice that demands to be heard.	2004-06-05

The title, the cover, and the premise hooked us.  Jen Abbas's wise words soothed us.<br />\\"Generation Ex\\" is more than a book for adult children of divorce.  It's a book for life's wounded.  It deals with God's redemption in the midst of heartache and loss.  Chapter after chapter provide tidbits for forgiveness and moving on.  Abbas's own restraint is commendable; she never lashes out or picks sides in her own family's upheaval.  This is exemplary, but it also made it difficult for me to connect with the book at times.  Perhaps dealing with these matters in a straightforward manner is best, yet if felt occasionally a bit clinical.  Toward the end, the book seems weighted heavily for those who are considering marrriage in the light of their own parents' struggles.  This makes the book particularly important for single adults.<br />Jen, thanks for sharing your own life and pain with us, and for doing so without bitterness.  Thanks for bringing a sense of hope to those who have known despair.	2004-05-29

If you've read Gansky before, you know he has a great imagination and the ability to tell a gripping story.  This, however, is Gansky at a whole new level.<br />When Perry Sachs, engineer/archaelogist, takes a team to Antartica, he discovers secrets beyond his initial expectations.  Although he is aware of something lurking beneath the ice, he is unaware of its full impact or of the forces intent upon reaching it.  Soon, Sachs and his team are hostages in a deadly game--hostage to the elements, to the evil of a secretive society, and to the truth of a artifact hidden for  thousands of years.<br />&quot;Beneath the Ice&quot; conveys the same realistic atmosphere of classic thrillers such as Alistair MacLean's &quot;Ice Station Zebra,&quot; while mixing in the bizarre twists of Dan Brown's &quot;The DaVinci Code,&quot; and Jeff Long's &quot;Year Zero.&quot;  Gansky employs minimal, but believable, character development.  His climax fails to serve justice in any fashion to the antagonists, but the book still ranks easily as one of the best Christian thrillers out there.	2004-05-28

It parallels Vincent's initially shallow view of religion with his shallow accessment of women.  As he goes through the crucible of his own sin and redemption, he gains a deeper understanding of life, relationships, and God's unfailing love.<br />Having traveled in mainland China myself, I worried that the book would waver in its attention to realism, but Dalton parcels out his details with a steady hand.  Although he writes with utmost respect for the Chinese culture, he never whitewashes its imperfections.  He expects us to view his characters and cultures with the same grace and forgiveness that he expects young Vincent to learn.  Along the way, we meet unforgettable souls, such as Alec and Jai-Ling.  We experience beauty.  We learn lessons for our hearts.<br />For years, John Le Carre has told stories of espionage which are often studies of the lonely soul and the things that motivate it.  Dalton does much the same thing in &quot;Heaven Lake.&quot;  He peels back the facades to reveal the intrigues of the heart.  In so doing, he has created a masterpiece.	2004-05-27

This time, his story revolves around a strict religious couple who lose their child due to a \\"faith\\" decision to avoid doctors and hospitals.  When they do take their child to the hospital, it's too late.  This sounds like a simple premise, but it allows room for issues of faith to be explored, and of course Singer brings in a number of other threads--prison scenes, money schemes, and themes of family and love.  Using the legal backdrop, he puts the pieces of the puzzle into place at the appropriate moments.  And a few of the pieces will surprise you!<br />Yes, I'll admit that I've become friends with Randy after reading his second novel.  No, that doesn't change my objectivity toward his writing.

The air is full of questions, and, as you lay eyes on that first page, you may find yourself only mildly intrigued or full-tilt attracted.<br />My first blind date with a Coben novel left me head over heels.  I loved the pacing, the intricate plot, and most of all the attention to family and relationship.  &quot;Gone for Good&quot; and &quot;Tell No One&quot; were masterpieces of suspense.  &quot;No Second Chance&quot; felt a bit more contrived, but I still enjoyed it throughout.<br />&quot;Just One Look&quot; is full of suspense, no doubt about it.  The plot unfolds in all the right places.  The characters react as might be expected.  Yet, I felt as though I was taking apart a music box that had been robbed of its melody.  Coben's family rhythms and song seemed muted.  The plausibility of the scenario was strained.  Sure, I was entranced by Grace's search to discover the truth behind her husband's disappearance and a decades-old photo, but I was not emotionally invested.<br />That said, Coben is a master of the serpentine mystery.  My love for his writing is steadfast.  Next time around though, I hope his characters have a little more time to look me in the eye and draw me into their world.  In this book-dating scenario, for me, it's all about relationship.	2004-05-18

Jefferson Scott makes his own paths through the forest of Christian fiction.  Rather than rely on tried--and tired--formulas, he creates series with freshness, warmth, and realism.<br />In the Firebrand series, he introduces us to a makeshift team of military experts who visit the world's trouble spots, offering physical and spiritual might to deal with problems.  The first book revealed the members of the team and transported them to a Russian satellite country.  The second book made us love the characters and their snappy dialogue, then whisked them into the the troubles of an African territory.<br />In this third book, Jefferson Scott tackles the dark and difficult times that Christians face in North Korea.  The story is a sobering and educational call for prayer and aid to our brothers and sisters in this closed country.  Despite gritty details of suffering, Scott uses the warm personalities of his Firebrand team and the faithful demeanors of the Koreans to keep the story from falling under its own weight.  When the team is called to rescue a group of North Koreans headed back to prison and torture, they respond with courage.  Although a few scenes seem to be missing important details about border crossings and derring-do, the plot races through China and Korea.  With chilling moments, warmth and romance, and a final understanding of God's miraculous involvement in our lives, this is a book to savor.<br />If you haven't read the previous books, go back and start at the beginning.  If you're already a fan, &quot;Deliverance&quot; is required reading.  It is the pinnacle of the series.	2004-04-30

My brother rarely reads, and if he says a book grips him, my ears perk up.<br />&quot;Beyond Fear&quot; was beyond my expectations.  I'm a fan of true-life adventures, such as &quot;The Perfect Storm,&quot; &quot;Into Thin Air,&quot; and &quot;In the Heart of the Sea.&quot;  This book may not live up to the sheer narrative power of those classics, but the writing sparkles, and the sheer staggering feat of the journey is unforgettable.  I laughed out loud in parts, shuddered in others, and felt inspired overall.  Not only is this a testament to human endurance, it's a great example of God's faithfulness in mankind's physical, spiritual, and emotional struggles.<br />For a book full of taut narrative, honest dialogue and interaction, and hair-raising accounts, &quot;Beyond Fear&quot; is beyond most of the books available.	2004-04-28

In &quot;The Summons&quot; and &quot;The Brethren&quot;, he seemed to have grown bored of his own writing, whereas &quot;A Painted House&quot; and &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; were attempts at new and great things.<br />&quot;The Last Juror&quot; starts off with a long character sketch, as though Grisham didn't have a better way to kick things off, but then he speeds us into a gripping story.  He introduces us to some memorable characters, and, as always, his dialogue and insights into human nature are superlative.  We witness a murder and the resulting trial through the eyes of a green newspaper editor.  We come to love and despise some of the townspeople.<br />And we wait for the dreaded moment when the murderer gets paroled, vowing revenge on his trial jurors.<br />If Grisham had skipped the whole second part of the book, he would have done nothing to disturb the plot.  The book would qualify as a breakneck thriller.  Instead, he spends a number of chapters providing a look at small town life in the early 70s.  War, racism, and capitalism are tackled--with commendable wisdom, yes--but the story drags.  Once we wade through to the third part, the story takes off again.  And Grisham adds a believable twist at the end.<br />I put this one down feeling that it was one of his best ever, save the social exposition in the middle section.  &quot;The Last Juror&quot; will not be Grisham's last word. Thank heavens!	2004-04-19

I loved a similar looking novel, \\"The Secret Life of Bees,\\" and I must say that I was expecting this book to live up to my enjoyment of \\"...Bees.\\"  An unfair expectation, I know.<br />Morris is a formidable writer.  He conveys the tale of young Brandon, a child pulled between a wandering mother and a loyal set of grandparents.  Morris' characters and dialogue, his descriptions and numerous similes, work effectively.  The book is everything one would hope for in a Southern novel.  It has humor, racial issues, spiritual moments, family dysfunction, and family honor.  Many scenes are worth savoring.<br />And yet, I had a difficult time with it.  Unlike \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" or \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" this novel has no mystery or secrets to drive it forward.  For me, it was a beautiful and classic vehicle lacking the gas to propel me along.<br />Yes, the jacket blurb gets it right: this novel will be remembered for the voice of its lead character.  That alone is high praise.  Although, with a backdrop of mystery, I could've been hooked beyond description.  Without a doubt, I'll go back and read Morris' first novel.  His writing is sublime.	2004-04-16

He's proven that humor can be funny and clean simultaneously.  His facial gestures, his voices, his rolled eyes, all add to the comedic experience.<br />In &quot;I Am What I Ate...&quot; Cosby tackles the issues of health and dying in the grand tradition of irreverence.  Speaking from a platform of retirement age, he can get away with this--particularly when he's throwing barbs at himself.  The sections on food and smoking had me laughing out loud.  Interspersed, Cosby adds some wry insight to the indulgent American mindset.  The writing is conversational and breezy.  I could almost imagine that Bill Cosby was reading it aloud.<br />And that's my only complaint.  He wasn't reading it.  He wasn't even in the room.  Much of his humor works wonderfully in a live setting, but here it brought mostly smiles, few actual laughs.<br />For a lightweight look at a heavyweight subject, this book is fun.  I'd still rather see the man live.  Please, Cosby, hold off on any funerals...we love having you around!	2004-04-09

With that question still lurking, &quot;The Jericho Sanction&quot; is a pertinent thriller.  Through the eyes of Peter Newman, Marine, we see once again the subterfuge and lies of Middle East politics--not to mention the politics of western capitalism and moral relativity.<br />Although the book stands alone, it will be particularly gratifying for those who have read the first novel, &quot;Mission Compromised.&quot;  We witness the events of the Newman family's survival, and the subsequent troubles they face when Mrs. Newman is kidnapped from a street in Jerusalem.  The attack is more than a personal vendetta; it is a ploy to sell nuclear weapons and track down embedded double agents.  Once again, a renegade Russian diplomat is at the helm, steering the story toward a conclusion that is realistic, but without any real surprises.<br />For readable, yet credible military thrillers, North and Musser form a team that's hard to beat.  North's background lends eye-opening insights into the political and military process, while Musser's prose brings the story to life.  With the loose ends left at the end of this book, I have no doubt that we'll be seeing a third book soon.  I can't wait.	2004-04-03

Some oversimplify, throwing out shallow solutions, while others weigh heavy with theological concepts that have little apparent connection to normal life.<br />In &quot;Balm in Gilead,&quot; Delffs strikes a balance between sound biblical instruction and applicable daily lessons.  He never claims to have easy answers.  His words, both poetic and true, reach to the core of what it means to follow Jesus through the maze of life.  As the title suggests, healing can come only through a heart softened by repentance.<br />Structurally, the book is easy to follow and even easier to apply to a small or large group settings.  Each chapter offers suggestions for movies, music, and literature that could be used in conjuction with the teaching.  The final chapter provides a guideline for a retreat, so that the reader can find time to soak in the lessons of heart-level healing.<br />Whether used individually or corporately, this is a book full of richness and warmth.  As a personal friend of the author, I can vouch for his sincerity in sharing these words of wisdom from his own spiritual walk.  Indeed, these words are a &quot;Balm in Gilead.&quot;	2004-03-27

These are words Amazon reviewers have used to describe this book.  Thus warned, I gave it a shot.<br />Weighing in under 200 very light pages, this novella is a work of wonder.  Albom uses minimalist prose to gain the greatest effect.  I've never read his work before, but I was impressed with his ability to capture character and settings in few words.  His people are working class, average joes--people we can relate with.  I thought the opening scenes and the war narratives were exceptional.<br />Sure, the themes here have been explored before.  No, Albom doesn't offer any particularly new revelations.  He doesn't even try to appeal to any one religious faith.  But he does succeed in reminding us of the value of life and the interconnectedness of fate and relationships and God's plan.  As the title suggests, the book will require a leap of faith and credibility.  If you're willing to make that jump, if you're willing to open your heart to this simple, yet profound tale, you'll be won over by the magical quality of &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven.&quot;	2004-03-25

The question is sure to be asked, whether Lynds compares to the master.  Let's put it this way: In the early 80s, Robert Ludlum swayed me singlehandedly to the genre of suspense fiction.  With books such as &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; and &quot;The Gemini Contenders,&quot; he established a new level of international intrigue.  I'll forever miss him--and his powers of storytelling, particularly while in his prime.  No one will surpass those masterpieces, in my opinion.<br />So here comes Gayle Lynds.  Not only did she join with Ludlum in writing the Covert-One novels, taking on all the pressure of having her name alongside his, she also writes her own bestsellers.  A woman...writing muscular thrillers...and doing it darn well, I might add!<br />&quot;The Coil&quot; could be another clone from Ludlum's conspiracy blueprint, but it raises the bar by giving us characters we care about.  Okay, many of them are props to propel the script, yet Lynds gives us enough time with a handful of primary players to find a connection.  Not only does this keep us turning the pages, it adds impetus to the final surprises.  (Don't let anyone spoil it for you!)<br />The story revolves around Liz Sansbourough, a former CIA operative, and daughter of the infamous assassin, the Carnivore.  Liz is dragged back into the violence she opposes when a dangerous opponent claims to have her deceased father's files.  Using the files' sordid detail, the unknown blackmailer is now twisting events and circumstances for his own dark purpose.  Even as this plot coils tighter, the truth behind the Coil comes into focus.  Liz must come out of seclusion to deal with this threat--for her own safety; for the safety of her relatives.<br />Lynds sticks closer to Ludlum's suspense than LeCarre's politicizing, but she does throw in a few tidbits for thought...&quot;they'll be crushed, or they'll get the right 'religion' and turn capitalist.&quot;  At times, the narrative becomes bumpy while jumping from one point of view to another mid-paragraph, but the story keeps speeding along.  Racing from one continent to the other, from one chase scene to the next, Lynds succeeds in matching all the best qualities of books such as &quot;The Matarese Circle.&quot;  Now it's Lynds' turn to sway readers to the genre of good old-fashioned, sprawling, international thrillers.point of view to another mid-paragraph, but the story keeps speeding along.

Silva represents all that I love about the old-school suspense masters, while threading in the wonderful aspects of the new.  Once again, in this installment of his Gabriel Allon novels, Silva uses the terse prose and historic settings of Jack Higgins, the conspiracy theory plotting of Robert Ludlum, and--in a nod to the new regime--a dose of emotion and pathos that make his characters memorable.<br />Although deeper and more convoluted than one might think initially, Silva's plot is delivered with clarity and nice pacing.  The characters and settings are drawn with credible detail.  The themes of Nazi war criminals, family honor, revenge, and the quest for truth are brought to bear as Allon once again finds himself pitted against a formidable foe.<br />Racing from Vienna, to Jerusalem, to Argentina, and Poland, this story is a masterpiece of character and conflict.  The roots of Allon's own family tree are dug up, and he must choose between burying his enemies or burying his desire for vengeance.  Although the issue of a rogue bodyguard is left dangling at the end, the climax is breathless and satisfying.<br />This is what great suspense tales are all about.  Silva deals with national strife and injustice, making his point within the story, while staying away from the pulpit-pounding that LeCarre resorts to in his own latest novel.  (I'm a LeCarre fan, but \\"Absolute Friends\\" left me absolutely worn out.)  Silva may have detailed \\"A Death in Vienna,\\" but he proves that there is plenty of life left in the Gabriel Allon series.	2004-03-15

With self-publishing so accessible, writers have opportunities like never before.  Unfortunately, I have read very few self-published novels that were well-done, and, as with this book, the covers always turn me off.<br />Ignore those concerns.  Set aside your prejudices.  This is everything a good suspense story should be: exciting, unpredictable, with interesting characters, and a thought-provoking concept.  Mixing ideas from &quot;Back to the Future,&quot; &quot;Timeline,&quot; and such recent novels as &quot;Time Lottery&quot; by Nancy Moser, Reaves adds his own creativity to keep the story fresh.<br />Brian Reaves writes with confidence.  Although a professional editor may have weeded out some minor point-of-view discrepancies and a penchant for adverbs (everything in this story happens &quot;slowly&quot; or &quot;quickly&quot; or &quot;suddenly&quot;), the sentences flow and the pace never flags.  Rather than aim too high, Reaves pulls us into the world of his characters through a simple device: a lost love from high school.  He whips this simple idea into a heart-spinning tale.  Then, as the story comes to a satisfying conclusion, he sneaks in a final twist that hooks us for the sequel.<br />It's about time a self-published writer made his mark.  One or two moments stretched my credulity, particularly when the main character forgets a vital piece of evidence--twice!--but my hat is off to this up and coming writer.  I have no doubt he'll be picked up by an established publisher soon.  His time has come.	2004-03-06

Books	5	25	25	N	N	Believe the Rumors	In a world full of lust and greed, in a culture fed by media ideals, life seems to be more hurried and confusing.  Shouldn't it be the other way around?  Shouldn't technology relieve our load?  Shouldn't tolerance eradicate war and conflict?<br />Yancey refuses to back away from life's tough issues.  Tackling them from an intellectual perspective, he doesn't offer easy answers.  Yancey writes clearly and with well-managed words.  He pulls back the curtain to reveal his own weaknesses and struggles.  Along the way, he tunes our ears to the hints and rumors of a world to come.  He puts thing in perspective.  Pointing to the very restlessness of man's soul, Yancey offers hope in the belief of a second reality, a spiritual reality.  He suggests that we are caught in a tension between two worlds--the temporal and eternal.<br />I'm impressed by Yancey's usage of historical snippets and recent research to turn up the volume of these spiritual rumors.  Like C.S. Lewis before him, Yancey helps us face the evidence of a God who has created us with a purpose and a destination.  Mere Christianity is all about learning to see how this life coincides with the one to come.  After reading Yancey, I'm inclined to believe the rumors.	2004-03-05

Reed Arvin is a talented writer, depicting believable characters and realistic settings amidst important themes.<br />The story follows a down-and-out lawyer who becomes part of a personal investigation into the death of a friend.  In the past, Jack has sacrificed his career on the altar of passion and personal need, and once again he succumbs to the allure of a beautiful woman.  Michele is a big star with a lowly past.  When the past and the present collide in  her life, murder and betrayal become the inevitable results.  Shady characters abound, and Jack must fight his own demons to ride to the rescue.  But is Michele a part of the subterfuge?  The answer will have life-threatening consequences.<br />Unlike Grisham's legal thrillers, Arvin's story is much heavier on character and philosophizing.  In the vein of James Lee Burke and John D. MacDonald, Arvin gives us something to sink our teeth into.  Every chapter contains scenes or snippets worth mulling over.  You'll laugh, cringe, and respond emotionally to these characters and their struggles.<br />Arvin has a history in the world of religious publishing.  Justifiably so, he has shifted his formidable skills to a much larger realm.  My one caveat: Somewhere along the way, he seems to have abandoned the redemptive value of story.  Most will disagree with me, I'm sure.  Don't get me wrong--I loved this book and the beauty of the narrative.  But with Jack's romanticized angle on adultery and his bitter ventings against God, I couldn't help believing the story would end with some glimmer of a lesson learned, a hope rekindled.  James Lee Burke is a master at this sort of thing: portraying life's grittiness while still holding to a reverent faith.  Without a doubt, Reed Arvin has the same skills and insights, the same pathos and melancholy.  In the darkness of the savage world he depicts, I hope he hasn't said his last goodbye to the very light which brought him to this point.<br />That said, I will be anticipating his next novel.  Great writing is a rare commodity, and Arvin proves he is one of the best around.to this point.<br />That said, I will be anticipating his next novel.

With &quot;Black,&quot; he takes a decided gamble, bending every genre to his will--fantasy, suspense, romance, End Times thriller, and historical novel.  For that alone, he deserves applause.  Rather than stick to his proven formula, he goes for broke.<br />For me, comparisons to &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;  were misleading.  Once I set aside those ideas, I realized the book was more closely related to &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia.&quot;  Yes, it explores parallel worlds and fantasy elements, but it leans more heavily on Narnia's deceptively simple, almost child-like view of great spiritual truths.  A young audience could read and enjoy this book, while adults could spend hours discussing its theological implications.<br />From the moment Thomas Hunter starts bouncing between two worlds, we know that Dekker is going to take us on a wild ride.  The ride could've been jarring and disjointed; instead, Dekker shows his skill at storytelling, weaving seemingly unrelated stories into a cohesive and symbolic whole.  Although we rarely fear for Hunter's safety--he has miraculous recourses to protect him--we can't help but pull for him every step of the way.  He is out to save himself, his sister, his budding romantic interest, and the world at large.<br />&quot;Black&quot; demonstrates the wide possibilities of Christian fiction, and Dekker shows that he is unafraid of exploring those boundaries.	2004-02-28

Fantasy and allegory are compatible shelf-mates in the world of fiction.  Yet, for some reason, the Christian market has generally ignored them since the days of Tolkien and Lewis.  Karen Hancock, Randall Ingermanson, and Michael Warden are leading the way to see that this changes.<br />Hancock's first novel, \\"Arena,\\" was a wonderfully rendered allegory, full of interesting characters, landscapes, and inner struggles.  \\"The Light of Eidon\\" is more fantasy than allegory, but spiritual truths abound.  Again, Hancock introduces us to characters with deep doubts and allows us to witness their transformations.  In this case, a religious student by the name of Abramm comes face to face with betrayal, loss of faith, and rebirth in the flames of violent struggle.  He finds himself a slave, a gladiator, a pretender...But ultimately, Abramm must discover his true purpose.<br />Although the book has some fantastic sections and ends with a heart-pounding climax, I found myself plodding through a number of scenes.  At times, I yearned for more of the colorful landscape and less of the political dealings.  I'm glad I pressed on, though, because the overall result is worth it.  Spiritual light is brought to bear on the ugliness of religious pretense, and Abramm's final decisions are moving and believable.<br />It's great to see fantasy writers rising up in the Christian market.  Without Hancock's books, we would be deprived of some of the best new stuff available.	2004-01-21

Although &quot;Paranoia&quot; is in many ways a throwback to good old fashioned suspense, the praise is warranted.  The story reads like a mix of Harlan Coben and John Grisham.  The writing is lean, the plotting tight, and--despite the fast pace--Finder allows time for the characters to live and breathe.  My heart was racing because I cared about these characters.<br />The conflict revolves around Adam Cassidy.  He's an under-achiever at Wyatt Telecom, a likeable guy, an occasional risk-taker.  He's also a man hiding from his own estranged feelings toward his dying father.  Adam's character traits and flaws are put to the test when he finds himself blackmailed into corporate espionage after throwing an unauthorized party on company funds.<br />Within the first few pages, the rollercoaster ride begins.  To avoid legal procedures, Adam succumbs to the pressure of his dictatorial boss and agrees to steal hi-tech secrets from Wyatt's rival, Trion Systems.  Before he knows it, he is caught in a web of lies and deception.  His actions threaten his budding romance with a coworker, his own safety, and his chance of coming to any reconciliation with his feelings toward his father.<br />The short chapters and snappy dialogue of &quot;Paranoia&quot; kept me turning the pages, but it was my concern for Adam and his somewhat self-imposed troubles that kept me hooked.  Finder gives time for matters of the heart, while advancing his story on every page.<br />Paranoia is the key that starts the whole scheme, and, ultimately, Adam Cassidy discovers that his paranoia is justified.  As the ending drew close, I hoped for the best, yet feared the worst.  Instead, Finder pulls out a few surprises that bring his tale to a bittersweet, somehow inevitable, conclusion.  This masterpiece mixes components of such classics as &quot;The Firm&quot; and &quot;The Sting&quot; into a modern thriller for the hi-tech generation.	2004-01-14

I particularly enjoyed &quot;Girl Interrupted&quot; and &quot;A Beautiful Mind.&quot;  I was blown away, however, by the fresh and tender perspective of Melody Carlson in &quot;Finding Alice.&quot;<br />Alice is a borderline genius, a college-aged girl who begins protracted dialogue with imaginary friends (and enemies).  Connecting herself to images from &quot;Alice in Wonderland,&quot; Alice's own lines of reality become blurred, and in the process she finds herself facing cold, clinical treatment.  Carlson's story doesn't linger here.  Instead, she takes us on a journey of hope.  We follow Alice, hearing her thoughts, her fears, her confusion, as she begins to take her own life and sanity under control.  Shrugging the religious pretensions that have only muddied the waters, Alice turns to a kind woman and a caring young man who bring true Godly light into the situation.<br />Carlson handles Alice's transformation brilliantly.  The emotional, physical, mental, and spiritual issues are addressed, and never sugarcoated.  We care about Alice.  We want her to come around.  We long for her to sift through the turmoil in her own mind. I found myself gaining deeper understanding and empathy for those with similar struggles.  I closed the book with tears in my eyes--tears of hope, faith, and thankfulness.<br />I thank God for Christian writers who are tackling these difficult subjects.  Mental illness is rarely addressed in church circles, and, as suggested in this novel, it's often passed off as a demonic problem.  Yes, I believe we are in a spiritual struggle that can affect body, soul, and mind; through this story, however, Carlson tenderly points out our need to broaden our views and open our arms to those in mental anguish.	2004-01-12

First, sketch a superhero with no flaws, make a serpentine and startling plot, and add a bunch of bloodshed and explosions for good measure.  Yessiree, Hollywood will come knocking!&quot;<br />No, this can't be the way it happens.  In &quot;Odd Thomas,&quot; Koontz shows again his penchant for likeable but flawed people--quirky characters on the fringe of society.  With all odds against his bestseller formula, he keeps these tales coming.  Once again, he tells a story draped in dark deeds and horror, yet continues to bring light and hope and love into the mix.<br />Odd Thomas is our hero.  He's a short-order cook in a medium-sized town, and he sees dead people.  While making serious and at times humorous comments on society and spirituality, Thomas keeps his eyes on the task at hand: A new evil has entered the town and Thomas knows that many lives are threatened.  Even as he attempts to avert the coming disaster, he falls more in love with his long-time love interest.<br />The final scenes are blood-pumping, life-affirming, and emotion-wracked.  &quot;Odd Thomas&quot; shows Koontz to be an author in love with words and characters and life.  Although I don't always agree with his spiritual take on things, I'm always impressed and entertained by a man willing to write us to the edge.  This is a great book.	2004-01-07

It's true: If you're a fan of the modern, hard-hitting, and action-packed mysteries that now abound, this may not be the series for you.<br />Whereas many of the newer writers resort to Hollywood-style scenes and cardboard characters, Sally Wright turns her eye to the struggles of the human soul.  She writes about believable characters, taking us into their thoughts and motivations with skill.  The dialogue is sharp and attuned to its setting and era; the atmosphere is palpable; the faith issues are real, yet never preachy.<br />Okay, I'll admit that the book did not &quot;grab&quot; me.  It didn't take off like a rocket, with this reader hanging on for dear life.  It did draw me in, however.  I found myself looking forward to these treasured forays into the world of academia.

He writes with clarity and beauty, shedding light on the lessons of life that pulse beneath the surface of numerous fairy tales.  Not only does he give us deeper understanding of literary device and the original versions of many stories (for example, I was surprised by the real ending of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;), he helps us find spiritual meaning.<br />&quot;God of the Fairy Tale&quot; is a book that even a kid could appreciate, but it resonates with richness and insight.  With short, palatable chapters, Ware divvies out his ideas and leaves us enriched and enlivened in the process.	2003-12-22

Grisham's \\"Skipping Christmas\\" was a humorous escape last year, but this book looked a bit more serious.<br />\\"The Winter Seeking\\" is a concise and wonderfully rendered tale of a woman dealing with many of the emotions we confront during the Christmas season.  She struggles with her parents' divorce and her mother's illness.  She also wrestles with her own issues of faith.  When, at the suggestion of another young lady, she decides to read the Christmas account and put herself into the story, her perceptions begin to change.<br />In some emotionally-charged, yet understated, final scenes, Vinita Hampton Wright wraps up a story that adds depth to the season.  It never sugarcoats, but it does bring comfort.  It never preaches, yet it offers hope.  Sometimes laughter is a great medicine; in this case, a few tears clean the soul.	2003-12-19

The answer is two-fold.<br />Yes, in \\"Angels and Demons\\" Brown shows that he has the chops to write consistently fast-paced thrillers, with intriguing historical tie-ins.  Instead of dealing with the Knights Templar and the Holy Grail, this time he tackles the Illuminati and their anti-religious zeal.  When a scientist is murdered and branded with an ancient anagram, our old friend Robert Langdon is dragged into a serpentine scheme to undermine the foundations of Catholicism.<br />As always, Brown divvies out his facts and plot twists with perfect timing.  He gives little time to breathe, but offers tidbits of character development that keep us caring about Langdon--even if only on a peripheral level.<br />Ultimately, though, this book stumbles under its own weight.  It could've ended a hundred pages earlier and been a tighter, more believable novel.  Instead, Brown goes for broke...and leaves us feeling a little over/under-whelmed.  He makes some fascinating arguments for the value of spiritual and moral existence, while also diluting these ideas with pantheistic mumbo-jumbo.<br />According to the author himself, the next Langdon book will delve into the secrets of the Masons.  I'll be quick to pick up a copy.  I won't be reading it to find out universal truths, but I will love every minute of Brown's superb storytelling fervor.	2003-12-08

He jumps from fantasy and sci-fi to historical fiction with ease.  As in his previous novel &quot;Ice,&quot; his storytelling is fast-paced and always full of memorable detail.<br />&quot;Chayatocha&quot; (pronounced &quot;kie-ah-toe-ka&quot;) follows the tale of a wagon train headed for the Oregon Territory in the mid 1800s.  Already struggling with the hardships of the trail, the group of pioneer families make a fateful decision when they turn away from an alleged Indian massacre and head for an uncharted pass through the mountains.  There, they discover something far more deadly than renegade Indians...They run headlong into &quot;Chayatocha.&quot;<br />The story moves quickly, leading from historical fiction to near horror-type details.  Soon, team members and oxen are missing; others are dead; and only a few are bound to survive.  The heart of the story beats with Daniel Paladine.  He's a bookworm, a school teacher, nothing like your typical frontiersman.  Through his horrifying experience, he comes to understand the love and sacrifice of his Savior.  Only then is Daniel able to confront the evil that has overtaken them.<br />Although explanations of the horror came too quickly for me, thus muting some of the suspense, I couldn't stop reading to discover the truths and lies behind Johnson's fascinating story.  And, of course, the question remains: Will his wife and son survive?  You'll have to read the story to find out.	2003-12-08

If you've read Ingermanson's previous works, you know that he dabbles in sci-fi, suspense, and futuristic thrillers.  Knowing that this book was a sequel of sorts to &quot;Transgression,&quot; I was surprised to discover Ingermanson's skill with historical fiction.<br />The story follows Rivka and Ari, two modern day adults thrust into a first century world via a wormhole.  (This part of their tale was told in the first book, so a new reader might want to go back and read the first book as well.)  The daily life and work of Jerusalem, AD 57, is brought into vivid focus.  The struggles and cultural barriers are drawn clearly.<br />The heart of this novel is Rivka's place as a seer woman.  Due to her knowledge of history, she is able to forewarn the citizens of Jerusalem about upcoming events.  When, however, some of her &quot;predictions&quot; miss the mark, she is accused of being a false prophet, and her husband Ari loses his place of honor.  As the story delves deeper into the turmoil and corruption of the day, Rivka and Ari must face the consequences, good and bad, of their premonitions.<br />Although the story is slower paced than his other works, &quot;Premonition&quot; keeps us turning the pages by showing us realistic characters facing very contemporary struggles of faith.  The last fifty pages are beautiful and heart-wrenching.  If you have an interest in messianic Judaism, this book is a must.  If not, &quot;Premonition&quot; will stir your soul.	2003-11-30

Sometimes it tackles relevant topics while forgetting to tell a gripping story; other times it captivates us with fast-paced tales while leaving truly important issues in the dust.<br />Feldhahn surprised me.  She faces the issues of Internet porn and sexual addiction with honesty and grace.  She manages to show the human side of the story and put it into a spiritual perspective, and--here's the catch--she puts it all in the framework of a thriller.<br />The story follows Doug Turner, a Christian man with an addictive personality; Ronnie Hanover, a young woman with a dark past and a seedy career; and a number of criminally minded characters who aim to bring down America with a terrorist plot.  These principals are thrown together in a well-crafted novel.  Although a bit long, Feldhahn keeps us caring about her characters.  Yes, she may seem a bit churchy at times, but she throws in dialogue to lighten the mood.<br />As a man, I enjoyed this book for its story, but I also felt challenged by its call to purity and its unflinching ability to tell the truth about this issue without making it gratuitous.<br />I've been won over; now I have to go and read Feldhahn's first book.	2003-11-21

This time, Jon Bennett and Erin McCoy are under intense fire in Palestine.  The casualties mount as they try to escape a brewing civil war.  Even as violence escalates, the opportunity for a widesweeping peace agreeement arrives from an unexpected source.  As the title suggests, &quot;The Last Days&quot; provides a story that many Christians could enjoy, while also showing some understanding toward the Palestinian situation.  With a plot that could fit nicely into an apocalyptic thriller, Rosenberg takes us on a rollercoaster through the Middle East and its conflicts.<br />He also cheats us at a few points.  He leads us through an extended dream sequence, convincing us that it's reality until another chapter.  Then, he adds a minor plot thread that is useless to the story and nothing more than an improbable wild goose chase.  He does not need this to keep the tension ratcheted.  I should've suspected such tactics when I noted that every single chapter starts with a one-line paragraph; this smacks of a writer who doesn't trust his own pacing.<br />These issues aside, I enjoyed the book.  Unfortunately, they left me feeling ambivalent by the end.  Perhaps in a third novel, Rosenberg will trust his own storytelling and leave the tricks aside.	2003-11-13

Should we be using &quot;The Matrix&quot; to learn lessons of the Christian life?  Are our hearts &quot;good,&quot; as Eldredge asserts, or has he bought into a humanistic spirituality?<br />The answers, for those who choose to read to the end of this short work, are within.  Yes, this book is biblical.  Although it's no masterpiece of homiletics or exegesis, it does hold to the heart and spirit of Christianity.  Yes, it uses lessons from popular movies and novels to convey spritual truths--and quite effectively, I might add!  Eldredge makes it clear &quot;The Matrix&quot; will not save us.  He does, however, use it to highlight ideas.<br />In regards to the goodness of the human heart, it's true that I started to wonder how far he would take the concept.  Was he suggesting that sin is no longer a struggle for us?  Was he trying to say that the human condition is not seditious and in need of redemption?<br />Quite the opposite.  Eldredge makes it clear further on that we must be in relationships of accountability, that we must be confessing our sin and dealing with it on an ongoing basis.  What he does want to communicate is that Jesus came to purchase our freedom, yet we still live with slave mentalities.  God reached out to cleanse that which he made pure in the beginning, yet we walk around with self-deprecating words and expressions instead of moving forward in God's kingdom.<br />By the end of this book, I was convinced that the ideas were true to the heart of Scripture and that we could all benefit by the honesty and openness of living with hearts that are good, while never hiding from the impurities and assaults of life that try to drag us back into darkness.<br />Easier said than done.  But we have to start somewhere. Why not start by &quot;Waking the Dead.&quot;	2003-11-10

As a writer, though, I was interested to read his insights on the writing life.  The book looked readable.  Helpful.  Witty.<br />I wasn't disappointed.  In fact, I read the entire thing in one evening.  From peeks into the labor of the editing process to the debacle of writing the novelization of a movie, Brooks is honest and informative.  He gives glimpses into his own beginnings and inspiration without seeming self-absorbed.  He points future writers in the direction of hard work and quality craft.  He offers a wonderful look into the joys of fiction.<br />Stephen King and Anne Lamott have written sublime books on the world of an author, and now Terry Brooks adds to the list a book worthy of his predecessors.  If I had any doubts about his writing, I've now put those aside.<br />Time for me to grab one of his novels!	2003-11-10

They hit all the right notes in some places; in other places, they become saccharine and sticky-sweet.  &quot;The Guardian&quot; tried to be grittier, but failed to generate long-term suspense.<br />&quot;The Wedding&quot; is a sweet and satisfying sequel to &quot;The Notebook.&quot;  Again, we see Noah.  He is a wise and lonely man, who passes on his romantic notions to his son-in-law, Wilson.  Soon, the hasty wedding plans for Wilson and Jane's daughter take over the family's life.  Along the way, Wilson makes plans of his own to rekindle the romance he and Jane once shared.<br />As usual, the story has a few surprises (most of them not that hard to figure out, but cute), and there is never any doubt of the ultimate outcome.  My wife loved the book, whereas I found it a bit slow and predictable.  Overall, though, much closer to what Sparks does best...reminding us all to share our romance and keep it alive.  Not a bad message--especially for us guys.	2003-11-06
926493:US	50287514	R24O19RRVW2E09	1586607251	776741464	Gideon's Dawn	Books	4	5	7	N	N	4 1/2 Stars...A Future and a Hope	Christian fantasy...To some this is an oxymoron.  Although Tolkien and Lewis were forerunners in the genre, the church world has often thumbed its nose at the power of myth and fantasy to paint christological themes.  Conversely, some Christian fantasists have gone too far with the insertion of biblical ideas and weakened the power of their stories in the process.<br />&quot;Gideon's Dawn&quot; is a welcome addition to the short list.  It's greatest strength lies in the main character's weakness.  Gideon Dawning is a flawed and cynical man.  As he struggles in our own world with questions of family and the past, he proves sympathetic, yet hard to reach.  When a mysterious earthquake plunges him from the Colorado mountains into another world, he remains aloof to the hopes foisted upon him.  Only as his dark secrets come to light do we fully understand his reluctance to be anything other than a man without a purpose.  Gideon is a survivor, plain and simple.<br />Warden succeeds in creating a world both creative and familiar.  The depth of his world-making grows as the story moves on, and the glossary in the back of the book is helpful in keeping matters straight.  The author's work and the publisher's risk on this novel are well worth it.  Although the story has slow patches in the first half, it picks up the pace and leaves us wanting more.  With tighter editing, the book could've been 50 pages shorter, but the author refuses to settle for stale narrative and tries to give us more, rather than less.<br />Warden sets a new tone.  Along with Stephen Lawhead, Kathy Tyers, Randall Ingermanson, and Karen Hancock, the Christian fantasy market continues to expand, and, with the upcoming sequel &quot;Waymaker,&quot; we fantasy readers once again have a future and a hope.  Much like Gideon Dawning himself.	2003-10-25

He juxtaposes violence and poetic narrative with sublime skill.<br />Once again, he takes us into the world of Dave Robicheaux and Clete Percel.  A number of seemingly unrelated mysteries dovetail into an indictment of one family and their evil hold in the environs of New Orleans.  From the alcohol-related death of a teenage girl, to the mythic struggle between priest and sinner, we are thrust into a world belonging entirely to James Lee Burke.  We meet new characters and old, and discover the answers to mysteries old and new.<br />For these reasons, I can't help but recommend this novel.<br />On the other hand...Some major changes happen in this installment of the Dave Robicheaux mysteries, and I felt cheated out of the essential grieving process.  Although Burke shows some of these changes with grace and sensitivity, he shows them after the fact.  I would've preferred that he deal with them directly.<br />James Lee Burke is a master, and, compared to many others' works, this book still stands above.  By the standards he has set, though, I found myself disappointed.	2003-10-20

His writing is full of the real-life struggle many of us face in our faith.  With these attributes in mind, I looked forward to this new series.<br />The idea is straightforward.  The gospel story is dropped into a near-future setting, with New York City as the primary background.  Alex Hunter, an agent for an international group called ICON, is hot on the tail of religious extremists.  When one of the extremist leaders is murdered, Hunter is drawn deeper into this violent web.<br />Sounds promising, but it devolves quickly into a transparent tale.  The danger of retelling the gospel story is that we already know what's going to happen.  New ideas and subtleties are necessary to keep us involved and to give us fresh perspective.  Unfortunately, for me, this was predictable and stale.  I wanted to like it, but I found myself skimming pages, waiting for something unexpected, for a new twist.  When I ran into the NY governor, named, you guessed it, Pilate...I groaned aloud.<br />For a quicker read, I'd suggest the graphic comic book version.	2003-10-20

From me, this is a huge compliment.  Van Gogh had an almost simple way with color and form; he attacked his subjects with raw energy; a child's exaggerated grace leapt from his canvas.  In much the same manner, Morgan's words are lean and raw, yet full of life and color and grace.<br />\\"Brave Enemies\\" follows young Josie Summers as she escapes a horrible situation at home, disguises herself as a man--in part, to avoid punishment for a crime committed--and finds herself walking through the Carolinas as the Revolutionary War takes its toll on everyone around her.  She marries, becomes pregnant, and goes to war at the famed battle of Cowpens.  Surprises lurk, and lessons are learned, and a vivid history lesson courses through the narrative.<br />With \\"Gap Creek,\\" Morgan made his way into the public eye.  He followed that book with \\"This Rock,\\" a powerful book, but one lacking sympathetic or central female characters.  For this reason, he seemed to lose some of his Oprah-generated audience.  Well, \\"Brave Enemies\\" races ahead with all the elements that made \\"Gap Creek\\" a success.  Strong female lead.  Obstacles overcome.  Tragedy endured.  Be warned, some scenes are horrifying in their depictions of war and abuse of women.  Yet Morgan imbues even these with his usual grace and his views that try to balance a world gone astray.<br />If you, like me, find Morgan's writing elementary at first, keep reading and discover the economic poetry that runs through every word he pens.  Morgan, like Van Gogh, creates masterpieces.	2003-10-14

Into the halls of power and might?  No.  Into the corridors of a passionate reader's mind, yes.  In fact, her ode to literature might be titled \\"Finding Mr. Write.\\"  She points out, quite fittingly, the relationship between readers and their chosen printed companions.  If you, like Ms. Nelson and this reviewer, have ever fawned over an intriguing title on the shelf like a teenager harboring a crush, then you'll adore the insights and shared intimacies of \\"So Many Books, So Little Time.\\"<br />Nelson attacks her subject with, uh, uninhibited desire.  Examining a year of her own reading habits, she unveils the tendencies and quibbles and sparks of heated excitement found between the covers.  (Of printed matter, of course--don't let her infatuations confuse you.)  The metaphor is appropriate, if you share her love for books.  There's the starry-eyed introduction, the clumsy yet heady getting-to-know-you stage, the culminating union of heart and soul.  Our mothers tried to warn us, though: \\"Be careful, I tell ya.  Most boys are up to no good.\\"  Yeah, and not all books are as wonderful as they appear; not all classics live up to our expectations.<br />Nelson's unafraid of pointing fingers here.  She tells us which ones left her uninvolved and clammy.  While dispensing insights into her own roles as wife and mother, she also reveals truths she's discovered through the joys (and travails) of reading.  Not all books are for everyone.  Not everyone finds a match the first time around.  Nelson never loses faith, however, in the idea that reader and book will find each other eventually.<br />In this search for Mr. Write, Nelson keeps us laughing at her, at ourselves, and the wacky world around us.  For the jaded among us, beware...You might find yourself falling in love all over again.	2003-10-14

With a quirky title and an edgy cover, this book snagged my eye.  Twenty pages into it, you know that this mystery is far different than anything else in the Christian fiction market...maggots in a cadaver's eyesockets, bugs crawling everywhere, and lead characters that make you squirm and laugh in the same paragraph.  Yeah, this book is its own new species.<br />I loved every minute.  I looked forward to each new chapter.  The mystery itself is handled well, particularly in its inclusion of entomology (study of bugs...oooh).  The main surprises don't come from the mystery, so much as from the characters themselves.  These people think and do things that don't always make sense--kind of like real people!  You can't help but love (or despise) the people herein.  The Bug Man, in particular, is one of the more colorful leads I've come across in a while.<br />Read this book if you love a twisting, and twisted, tale.  Read it if you like imperfect yet likeable characters, with hints of romance on the side.  Don't come expecting a spiritual hammer to hit you over the head--there's no preaching here.  But if you believe that God works in subtle ways to change people from within, you'll get the point.<br />Oh.  And watch out for the end, it's got quite a bite.  Or should I say, sting?	2003-10-08

His own past has been put to rest--not many personal struggles in this book--but the past of Charleston and its secret societies has reared its ugly head.  When bodies are discovered beneath an old Freemason lodge, questions are asked.  Soon, Nick is chasing after the story of one man in particular--a man who lost his life in a hazing incident at the Citadel.  The chase leads him to Nevada and Illinois, but the primary story revolves around Charleston itself.<br />I've heard some complain that these books start too slow, but this installment provides a great hook in the prologue to help get us going.  Whereas some authors promise the world, then fail to deliver in the end, Brouwer winds his stories tighter and tighter so that the ending surpasses your expectations of early on.<br />If you love well told mysteries (Christian or otherwise), then this is one series that should be required.	2003-10-03

I love quality fiction, and I love the church...But I've also seen tame, watered-down versions of both.  As a former PK (preacher's kid), I've seen just about everything that happens in this book.  I wasn't sure, though, if Francine Rivers would get honest and get to the heart of the issues plaguing ministers and the modern church.<br />Wow!  She nails issue after issue on the head.  And she does so in the midst of a captivating story with believable characters.  We follow the tale of a small church that, in its dying hours, brings in a new pastor and his family.  Soon, the congregation is growing and things are looking great--from the outside.  From the inside, however, from the eyes of the pastor's wife and son and his elders, the problems are growing in proportion to the church's &quot;success.&quot;  The tale, spanning 15+ years, shows many of sacrifices and deceits expounded in the name of &quot;serving God.&quot;  None of the characters go unscathed.<br />A previous reviewer asked who this book was written for.  First, it is a challenge to those who cater to such shallow faith.  Second, it is an encouragement to those who have struggled through this and thought they were alone.  Third, it is for those who enjoy a well-told tale.  Yes, it is full of christian lingo and platitudes, but Rivers draws a line between the genuine and the counterfeit.  Believe me, most non-churchgoers can tell the difference quickly.<br />While heartbreaking at times, this is stuff that needs to be brought to light.  Rivers has won my respect with a story full of wisdom, grace, and God's honest truth.	2003-09-30

This novel's cover and title nabbed my attention, but the first chapter hooked me for good.  I was laughing out loud within the first few pages, and then--horror of horrors--forced my wife to listen to some of these scenes.  She bore with me.  Even giggled.  Laughed out loud, as well.<br />I sped on, enjoying the tale of Wolfe Boone, &quot;Boo,&quot; a newly converted horror writer, who throws his town of Skary, Indiana into an uproar when his faith threatens to derail his writing career.  This town has built its tourism upon his career.  What ever will they do?  Even more engaging: what will Ainsley Parker do?  She is the one waitress at the local Haunted Mansion restaurant who resents Boone's presence and refuses to serve him.<br />Until she has no other choice.  And discovers he's not all she's made him out to be.  In fact, he's somewhat...handsome!<br />The story is quaint, romantic, and often hilarious.  The lengths gone to by these townfolk to backslide their pet writer and revive the community are amusing.  Along the way, you discover the mystery of the town's many black cats, the taste of Mad Cow Meatloaf, the vision to see past other's reputations, and the sound of your own laughter.  Have fun!	2003-09-27

I've always approached Grisham's writing with an open mind, and, although I've trashed one or two of his books at this site--think, &quot;The Brethren&quot;--I've applauded when he tries something different and pulls it off.<br />&quot;Bleachers&quot; is a basic story of forgiveness and regrets.  As football players from a small town's past gather to honor their dying coach, they swap tales and a few secrets.  They reconnect.  Forgive and forget.  Remember and relive.  The ideas are straightforward, yet told with wit and wisdom.  Sure, some of characters may seem like stereotypes, but these are stereotypes we all know personally--if you grew up in a small town, at least.<br />My wife and I read this together in three short sittings, laughing, and reminiscing ourselves after closing the covers.  I am glad to see Grisham's pattern of stretching the mold he created.  Rather than remaining trapped by expectations, he continues to broaden and expand them.  If you want &quot;War and Peace,&quot; don't pick up a 163 page novella.  If you want an entertaining and heart-warming tale that you can digest quickly, this is the story for you.	2003-09-26

O'Connor writes with such wit and wisdom that I found myself overwhelmed.  I began to mark pages, then realized I was marking each and every one.<br />Tucked between two short pieces, the meat of the book deals with the craft of writing, the motivation and method, and the spiritual heart of fiction.  Never have I read so direct an approach to the mix of religion and art.  O'Connor's words can be applied to creative efforts in all fields and in all branches of Christendom.  Why then, with such poignant insights penned over forty years ago, does the Church at large still look down on artistic endeavor?  Must everything preach a literal sermon for the concrete Western mindset?  As O'Connor makes clear, art speaks truth only when it embraces life in all its shades of good and evil.<br />This book could be titled aptly, &quot;Freedom and Frustrations.&quot;  Any writer diving into this work will discover O'Connor's pearls of wisdom beneath the waves of public narrowmindedness.  Don't pass this by if you wish to make art that matters.  You'll be encouraged.  You'll also be freed to have fun in the process.	2003-09-21

Although the book stands alone, the tie-ins to the previous novel are well handled.<br />The story starts with a heart-rending hook: Kate Porter's husband disappears during their trip to Venice.  The only evidence of any wrongdoing is a broken blue tile.  Three years later, she has no answers and is going on with her life.  Soon, Kate is dragged into a plot that involves family secrets and national sins.  The search for the truth will lead her back to Europe and the heart of the Nazi evil.<br />I had two complaints while reading.  First, on the trivial side, the city of Corvalis (Kate's hometown) is actually spelled \\"Corvallis.\\"  I lived near there, so this inaccuracy tripped me up throughout.  Second, the meaning of the blue tiles was anticlimactic and felt forced.  Still, this is a story that is so much stronger than those issues and deserves to be read for entertainment and enlightenment both.<br />\\"Blue Night\\" has its dark side, but it won't leave you feeling blue.  I can't wait to read the third book, \\"North of Tomorrow.\\"	2003-09-20

Although his plot and pace kept the pages turning, Thoene took a little longer to show me which characters to put my heart behind.  Once the story's players were established, it was hard not to enjoy this novel.<br />Set in San Francisco and southern California, the story revolves around the threat of terrorist attacks.  After a bombing on a subway, a unit called Chapter 16 steps in to track down the culprits.  Despite the conflicts with his estranged wife, Steve Alstead helps his unit hone in on the suspects.  He has tried to keep his work separate from his home life, but that is about to change--and not on his own terms.  For the culprits are zeroing  in as well.  They have plans that will bring destruction on personal and public levels.<br />Thoene's story reads smoothly, bringing chuckles, thrills, and spiritual encouragement.  Even with an abundance of needless adverbs, he makes the dialogue crisp and down-to-earth.<br />If you liked Oliver North's &quot;Mission Accomplished,&quot; or Joel Rosenberg's &quot;The Last Jihad,&quot; you'll find this book to be a treat.  In fact, I set down Clancy's latest to speed through the pages of &quot;Shaiton's Fire.&quot;  And I don't regret it.	2003-09-06

I had no idea what I was missing!  This book deserves the status of a classic, all right.  It has memorable characters, vivid sentences and scenes, and holds a mirror to the errors of society.  Though fifty years old, the book is surprisingly modern in its perceptions.<br />The story follows Guy Montag, a fireman.  His job is to start fires, rather than put them out.  When the station receives calls about homes that harbor books, the Salamander fire engine races out with kerosene hoses to douse the residence and destroy the threatening pages.<br />What is really under attack in Montag's world is thought, intellectualism, connection between people.  The effects of TV and useless trivia, the conflict between art and entertainment, are highlighted here in the flames of Montag's burning.  When Montag turns the corner, deciding to combat this world gone mad, he faces deep and long-lasting consequences.  And the world will never be the same.<br />Bradbury succeeds in writing a very personal, yet very global tale.  The heat of this novel still emanates today.  Pick up this book--at the risk of feeling the heat!	2003-08-30

Conversely, if you wish for something thoughtful, lucid and tangible, \\"A Guide to the Craft of Fiction\\" is just that.<br />For me, the book seemed pretentious at first.  As I delved deeper, I discovered a refreshing wit and honesty hidden among wonderful quotes and pearls of wisdom.  Koch does not feign to understand everything about writing, and he does not try to fit everything into tidy little sayings for the wannabe bestselling writer.  No, he plows through the aches and pains and occasional joys of the fiction-writing process.<br />This book may benefit those early in the learning curve, though I suspect it offers even more tangible truths to those who have already persevered through the writing of at least one substantial work.  Either way, Koch provides tools for wordsmiths at any level.	2003-08-24

In a style all his own, he has tweaked the lines of fiction to create stories that resonate with our generation.  \\"Survivor,\\" \\"Fight Club,\\" and \\"Lullaby\\" are some of my all-time favorite novels.<br />That said, I got \\"Diary\\" with high expectations.  As some have noted, Palahnuik's unique voice has started to become an echo in each novel, and I hoped he would break his own mold.<br />He does.  For good and for bad.  Although \\"Diary\\" has themes that seem tamer and more polished in delivery, they are aimed more precisely than in some of his other works.  The style is more subtle, more subdued.  I read entire chapters waiting for one Palahnuikism to jot down in my memory banks, but few showed up.<br />In \\"Diary,\\" Chuck steers away from clever sentences and goes for a clever overall picture.  Just as his characters discover that art is birthed through pain and suffering, we the readers discover the beauty here by overcoming more obstacles than in his other novels.<br />Overall, I loved the theme of art inspired by pain, but never felt deep connection with any particular character or setting.  I respect an artist/author willing to shift gears mid-career--U2 did so in the early 90s and fumbled back to greatness--and I believe Palahnuik will do the same.  Here, he reinvents himself.  \\"Diary\\" is his turning point.  Though he might not connect with everyone, I believe he's taken a step toward bigger and better things.	2003-08-23

This is one fun and fast-paced mystery.<br />Lucky, our likeable and flawed hero, is a taxi-cab driver/evening bartender, who stumbles into a conspiracy that will soon threaten his life.  When he picks up a beautiful call girl in his cab one day, he has no idea that her secrets will turn his world upside down.<br />And he fights back.  For her sake.  For justice's sake.  For his own selfish reasons, which only make him seem more human.<br />Compton writes with an easy conversational style, and, although the book has its expected share of typos and grammatical errors, it's hard to ignore the sheer energy of the story.  He creates som believable and unforgettable characters (\\"Tiny,\\" \\"Chili,\\" and \\"Sgt. Zale\\" come to mind).  Some scenes will make you laugh out loud, others will cause you to shake your head in amazement, while occasional pages will suprise you with their warmth and irony.<br />If you want to see Nashville in a modern fictional setting, if you like humor and pathos to temper scenes of violence and dirty dealings, than \\"Lucky in Nashville\\" fits the bill.	2003-08-22

The marketers try to convince us that every writer of legal thrillers is &quot;the next John Grisham.&quot;  Within the Christian market, the twist goes like this: &quot;he's the Christian John Grisham.&quot;  (As if Grisham's books aren't often Christian in content!)<br />Well, I'm here to say that two writers live up to the pretentious billing.  Randy Singer, who recently won a Christy Award for &quot;Directed Verdict,&quot; is one of them.  Robert Whitlow, also a Christy Award winner, is the other.  Both authors tell gripping tales with Christian themes and believable characters.  Both are capable of matching the best legal thrillers out there.<br />In &quot;Life Support,&quot; Robert Whitlow tells a story both simple and serpentine, both vicious and full of grace.  I picked up the book and found myself hooked by the attempted murder at the beginning (which the back cover should not have given away...shame, shame!).  The guilty wife is soon trapped by circumstances and connives to protect herself, dragging an unwitting and honorable attorney, Alexia Lindale, into her scheme.  Lindale is a likeable character, and I enjoyed following her spiritual, romantic, and legal journey.  Within three sittings, I had devoured the novel.  Although Whitlow steps away from the story once or twice to deliver mini-sermons, he always speaks truth.  And, in the book's conclusion, he was careful to play his hand lightly, thus adding to the impact.<br />I highly recommend this book, and believe it is Whitlow's finest to date.  With these authors presenting such compelling evidence, who can honestly discount the legal thriller's ability to make a strong case for God's working in everyday humanity?<br />I rest my case.	2003-08-18

The settings, characters, dialogue, are recognizable to any small-town Oregonians.  Of course, Jim Brown used to anchor the news in the area where I lived, so he should be capable of painting an accurate picture.<br />Oh, and what a picture he paints!<br />\\"Black Valley\\" is the epitome of suspense fiction.  Full of bizarre scenarios, walking dead men, and gruesome deaths, this book will take you by the throat and shake that slumber from your eyes.  I tried to go to sleep a few times, but, no, \\"Black Valley\\" insisted that I press on to the wild finale.<br />As with Brown's \\"24/7,\\" the story is tightly plotted, and he juggles his characters without dropping the reader in the process.  Also, as in his debut novel, he allows only brief moments for us to care about these characters.  Intermittently, I was touched by their inner dilemmas, but Brown relies on the plot to chase us through each chapter.  In the end, despite the flurried page turning, I had little concern or connection with those thrust into this horrendous maelstrom of suspense.<br />If you want intelligent storytelling that takes your breath away, Brown is a master.  Both his novels will satisfy.  He comes up with terrific premises, and, just when you think the ideas are too farfetched to believe, he comes up with ways of making them palatable--even frightening.  No time for deep characterization here, but no time for sleeping either.  These books will grab you by the throat.	2003-08-15

The subject matter, and the witty writing, had me by the throat.  I grew up as a PK (preacher's kid), so naturally I was curious to sneak a peek into another man's perspective on that awkward coming of age.  With wry humor and intelligence, Brad Whittington peels back the curtain into a young man's mind, revealing friendship and female frustrations, loneliness, geekiness, and spiritual wrestlings.<br />Young Mark Cloud is a likeable and comedic conduit for lessons of mercy and grace.  The story never preaches; it lets us see life and learn lessons through Mark's observant gaze.  Sure, certain points become wordy, and yes, there are serendipitous moments that might stretch some readers credulity, but I couldn't stop reading.  Some true gems of writing and life pop up through the pages of &quot;Welcome to Fred.&quot;<br />With this book and &quot;Flabbergasted,&quot; we are watching Christian fiction mature, particularly in regards to male perspective.  What fresh and fun stories.  What wonderful truths.  Keep these books coming...They are more than welcome.	2003-08-15

Their previous release, a book about U2, showed willingness to approach controversial issues with a loving and Christ-like attitude.  Here, the collaborative authors explore the lives and beliefs of a dozen current music icons.<br />The range is broad--Moby, to Al Green, to Beyonce--and the writing is smooth, for the most part.  Although some of the chapters delve into personal stances of the authors, most stick to the facts, offering clear and unflinching portraits of names familiar to all.  Like evidence in a courtroom of moral relevance, this book presents little known facts and rumor-busting explanations so that readers can judge for themselves these musicians' motives and methods.  You may be shocked by some bits of evidence, assuaged by others, angered or swayed as well.  But you will be challenged.<br />In a world of tepidness, Relevant Books continues to turn up the heat.  I am a writer.  My wife is a musician.  For other artistic souls, this book will stimulate ideas on how to merge vital Christian faith with the issues we face in this culture.  Don't miss this &quot;Spiritual Journey.&quot;	2003-08-12

I've read only two Koontz novels--yes, I'm an newbie--and they've had opposite effects on me.  The first was great, until a comic-book ending; this book drags and drags until a wonderful finale.<br />&quot;The Face&quot; follows widower Ethan Truman as he unravels the strange events happening around the Bel Air mansion he protects.  In the mansion, young Fric, son of a world famous movie-star, lives a solitary life that until now has seen little adventure.  Together, Ethan and Fric will face the horrible schemes of an &quot;agent of chaos,&quot; a professor with macabre hobbies--hobbies that include slow and torturous murder.<br />The story could be tightened into a 400 page ripsnorter, but instead we are treated to the flowery phrasing of Mr. Koontz.  Sometimes beautiful and eerie, sometimes just plain ole boring and overwrought, the sentences never fail to head in the right direction.  Eventually, the patient reader discovers the rewards of the final pages, where Koontz not only wraps his story in fable/allegory type images, he also proffers hope as though he truly believes...<br />It's this undergirding of destiny amidst chaos, of love amidst hate, that keeps Koontz's characters and plotting afloat.  It's this sense of humanity and divine that will keep this reader coming back for more.  (Even if I have to skim a paragraph here and there.)	2003-08-12

(I highly recommend \\"Virtually Eliminated,\\" if you've never read it.) Here, in the Operation: Firebrand series, Scott breaks fresh ground again, exploring military options from a Christian perspective. This time, his team is headed for Sudan to rescue enslaved southern Sudanese from cruel taskmasters.<br />The Firebrand team, a conglomerate of men and women from different backgrounds and with different skills, goes to world hotspots to rescue those in need. Financed by a wealthy Christian woman, the team is never without work--thankfully for us readers. While the first book was a bit ponderous in setting up the ideas for the series, this second gets going quickly. Scott writes gritty battle scenes--particularly in a heartwrenching prologue--but never for gratituous thrills. He has something to say about the needs of the world around us and the means in which we meet those needs. Operation: Firebrand is a great concept.<br />Scott creates some laugh-out-loud moments to lighten the mood at appropriate intervals. The dialogue is snappy.  Despite a large cast of characters, he keeps us sympathetic toward the team as a whole. The story is clear, the messages straightforward, and the plot fast-paced.  For me, the movie references and word pictures became too much a few times, but the story never flags.<br />If you enjoy adrenaline-packed stories, quirky and humorous characters, and morals to ponder as you turn the last page, then grab the first two books in this series and get ready for the third.<br />According to Scott's website, the Firebrand team is headed for North Korea next. That should be a timely and interesting read!	2003-07-22

She faces tragedy and triumph, and Kirkpatrick's graceful writing underscores Marie's emotions with a  no-nonsense approach.  Every detail is researched, every nuance believable.<br />In &quot;Every Fixed Star,&quot; once again we find Marie struggling with tragedy.  Her sons are increasingly withdrawn, and, when she finds new love, it too leads to sorrow.  Marie's guilt and questions in the face of her sons' anger is heartwrenching and true to character.  Marie is a woman searching for her life's calling, her &quot;metier&quot; (in French).  She finds herself taking blame for things, then questioning God's hand in certain events.  Her wrestling is something with which we can all relate.<br />Kirkpatrick's storytelling separates the tender ties of life and weaves them together into a colorful tapestry.  She allows the dark and the bright cords to twine together, her words contrasting heaviness and joy.  Although the decades worth of Marie's life made it more difficult for me to connect than in the first book, I pulled with her all the way, and am left wondering what will happen in the finale.  Some questions simple must be answered.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm talking about.  This is one tapestry you'll want to wrap yourself in.	2003-07-17

Romance and suspense?  I harbored a vague belief that it could work.  Like an old Helen MacInnes novel.  Or even a Mary Stewart.  Being a male hopeless romantic, I've hung on stubbornly as a Sparks fan, waiting for the same magic that I experienced in &quot;The Notebook.&quot;  Maybe this book would provide it.<br />&quot;The Guardian&quot; has promising flashes.  The characters are more believable and down-to-earth, the plot meatier than in most of his novels.  In essence, though, it is two books: a romance and a suspense story.  Unfortunately, the relational interests are wrapped up half way through, and the second half devolves into a predictable stalker story with more than a few elements that stretch credibility.  As a romance novel, it climaxes far too soon; as a suspense novel, it gathers speed at a snail's pace.<br />If two halves make a whole, then Sparks' effort to expand his capabilities can be seen as a success.  I give him credit for the attempt.  For this reader, though, two halves made a hole.  Once again, I'm left feeling empty.	2003-07-13

I knew it would be different from her father's, but I found myself comparing for the first twenty pages or so.<br />While the prose is lean and gritty--a family writing trait--the inner turmoils are less pronounced and the settings less colorful.  Soon, though, I found myself intrigued by this story of an underage prostitute discovered almost dead in the woods outside of Portland, Oregon.  I began to care for the female deputy DA as she unraveled the case, as she struggled with her own relational hangups.  I turned the pages...and forgot about comparisons.<br />&quot;Judgment Calls&quot; starts a little rough, reading more like a manual on legal procedures at times, but Alafair Burke knows her stuff and begins to smooth out the ride as the novel progresses.  She tells a good mystery, and I look forward to the sequel. Why live in her father's shadow when she can stand admirably on her own!  And I'm sure Mr. Burke would agree.	2003-07-03

Having discovered Silva's writing through \\"The Dead Artist\\" and \\"The English Assassin,\\" I've come to expect subtlety and nuance, with sympathetic characters.  Silva is one of my new favorite authors.<br />Going back to read \\"The Mark of the Assassin,\\" for me, was a disappointment.  While Silva's concepts and characters match those of his later books, he seems less focused here.  We watch political maneuverings, clandestine meetings, brutal attacks, yet never really doubt what's going on.  We see little of the main characters within the first hundred pages, and when Michael Osbourne and his wife do take center stage, they are puppets in a less than credible play.<br />The writing is fine.  Dialogue moves along.  But the improbabilities and coincidences begin to mount quickly.  Even as the pace picks up in the last quarter of the book, I found myself doubting the scenes.  One example: the KGB trained, world-renowned assassin moves in for the kill by taking the disguise of a bicycle courier(even getting multiple piercings to look the part), but as soon as our erstwhile hero sees him from a distance, the cover is blown.  Ah, too bad--all that effort for nothing.<br />For a fast-paced story and streamlined writing, \\"The Mark of the Assassin\\" surpasses many second-rate novels.  Clearly, though, with only his second book, Silva was fine-tuning his storytelling, and I had a difficult time getting lost in this tale.  Having been spoiled by his newer, richer work, I finished this one with barely a mark.	2003-06-24

Men don't read sagas of Indian women struggling for survival.  Men don't understand the emotions of a mother fighting for her children, of a wife absorbing a drunken husband's abuse.<br />Ah, but Jane Kirkpatrick is a writer capable of changing all that.  Her words have the power to change, the ability to open blind eyes and stubborn hearts.  Even this man can be touched by her story.<br />On the surface, the story is simple.  In the early 1800s, Marie Dorion, her children, and her abusive mixed-breed husband Pierre, trek across the plains and the mountains, aiding a party of adventurers intent on establishing new territory for rich men on the east coast.  They encounter snow, icy rapids, Indians, and starvation along the way.  They inch closer and closer to ultimate defeat.<br />But the story is so much deeper, really.  This is a nuanced account of a marriage.  It is a rich tribute to the strength and humility and determination of women in a man's world.  It's heartbreaking at times, life-affirming at others, and never anything but honest in delivery.<br />Jane Kirkpatrick, a master at her craft, continues Marie's trek with another book in &quot;The Tender Ties Historical Series.&quot;  I am compelled to follow.<br />Oh, what a trek this is!	2003-06-20

This guy paid his dues, starting off with self-publication after numerous large publishers rejected his manuscript.  He pounded the pavement.  He now regularly hits the bestseller lists.<br />\\"Transfer of Power\\" is my first foray into the world of Mitch Rapp, Flynn's perennial hero.  Mitch is a no-nonsense military man with a soft heart for the ladies.  Here, he goes head to head with his nemesis, a notorious terrorist.  The terrorist and his team have managed to infiltrate the White House and take hostages.  Fortunately, the president has escaped to an underground bunker.  Rapp's job is to penetrate the White House and take out the terrorists.<br />Yes, the story is that simple.  Nevertheless, Flynn manages to keep our interest all along.  The story harbors few surprises, but Flynn's narrative reads smoothly, taking only slight diversions to give us research info or character development.  Flynn splices his scenes smoothly, balancing the bits of action so that it never becomes confusing.<br />If you want a condensed Clancy thriller (with not as much detailed research) or a lite Daniel Silva novel (with not as much character development), Vince Flynn can scratch that itch.  He provides quick-hitting and entertaining tales.  The itch may go away for a short time only, but then, of course, you can always scratch with another Mitch Rapp adventure.	2003-06-14

How can you fault a writer or publisher who decides to give up time, comfort, and potentional profit for the sake of a charitable organization?<br />In his vintage manner, Bryson had me laughing in the opening chapter.  He pulled me into his excursion to the Dark Continent with promises of adventure.  This, I thought, is pure Bill-iance--using warmth and disarming revelation to ambush me with cold, hard facts.<br />Quickly, the thought faded.  This African diary is mild on adventure, lightly flavored with humor, and boasts only a few chunks of worthy information.  It's truly the sparsest of diaries.<br />I applaud this book and its goals.  If, however, you are looking for thirty minutes of Brysonian entertainment, this hardcover carries a hefty price for its content.  Buy it, instead, as a relatively small donation to good work being done halfway around the globe.	2003-06-10

Stine books.  She desires to know more about the spiritual realm, and she wants to face her fears.  Healthy desires, yes.  Open to deception, absolutely.<br />Bill Myers \\"Forbidden Doors\\" books have been just what the Physician ordered.  I've enjoyed Myers' adult novels, but I think his books for the younger set are even more entertaining.  And, above all, they shed light on the biblical definitions of good and evil.<br />\\"The Deceived\\" is the second book we've read together.  We liked the first book, but this one was even more riveting.  This time, Myers lets one of his main characters, Rebecca, face the deception that's all around.  She begins to succumb to the \\"logic\\" of reincarnation and hypnotism, mesmerized by the beguiling Maxwell Hunter.  Her struggle is believable.  Scary stuff.  And, with the end of each chapter, my daughter was begging for more.  In fact, she let her library book of R.L. Stine's sit abandoned on the table as we cruised through the pages of \\"The Deceived\\" to discover Rebecca's final outcome.<br />We've already obtained a copy of the third book, \\"The Spell.\\"  We can't wait to get started!  Hello, Bill Myers.  Goodbye, R.L. Stine!	2003-06-09

Okay, I've just gotta know...Who came up with this breezy cover and its light-hearted title hinting at all things zany?  Give that person a raise!<br />I was captivated before even reading the premise.  Then, thankfully, the premise looked promising as well.  I mean, how can you resist a tongue-in-cheek, fictitious look at singles and dating and church and life and the serendipitous ways in which they all come together?  Ray Blackston's irreverent ideas and the publisher's presentation had me thoroughly hooked.<br />But--and here's the crunch--could Mr. Blackston's writing live up to the hype?<br />Ha, I laugh at your doubt.  This book had me chuckling, shaking my head, wiping a tear from my eye, and jotting down quotable quotes all within 327 pages.  Let me tell you, these pages fly by, blown by the summer air that permeates the story, and by Blackston's lighthearted style.  In the midst of sharing Jay Jarvis' struggles to meet women and know God, Blackston communicates marvelous insights while never banging us over the head.  This is a book I'd give to my male friends.  And to my wife.  And to our single friends.  And...well, hey, why not send a copy to my mother-in-law.  She'll love me for it--and brownie points with the in-laws are always welcome.<br />Bottom line: &quot;Flabbergasted&quot; is a comic and wise peek into the ways that God works in our lives, leaning heavily on the romance side of things.  Never sappy, though.  Remember, this is from a guy's point of view.<br />If Bridget Jones ever met Jay Jarvis, there'd be all kinds of havoc.  Thankfully, Jay's in love with someone else.  Read the book and you'll know what being &quot;Flabbergasted&quot; is all about. Then, if you're like me, you'll be waiting for the promised sequel.	2003-06-03
1105772:US	50287514	R1M00FGGCZJCGU	0066212855	817493742	Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Glowing, Factual Lava	Sure, most of us have heard of Krakatoa.  The details may be sketchy in our minds, but we know that some volcano, at some point in modern history, put on one incredible display of nature's power.  If that's as far as your knowledge goes, this book provides a heavily researched examination of the cataclysmic event.  To read this book is to see the planet and mankind through different eyes.<br />Although Winchester spends over 150 pages leading up to the eruption itself, the information he brings to light adds so much to our understanding--geographically, socially, and politically--of this volcano's earth-rocking destruction.  He builds his book layer by layer, giving us insights into Dutch colonialism, subduction zones and plate tectonics, Islamic fundamentalism and tsunamis.  Not only does Winchester build up to that fateful day in 1883, he gives us details of the aftermath, details that still tantalize and disturb to this day.  Somehow, he also works in dry bits of humor.  Subtle, but intentional, these will leave you smiling if not laughing out loud.<br />My one complaint: Occasionally, Winchester provides footnotes and insights that merely tantalize.  For example, I wanted to know more about the ballooning spiders that arrived on the shores of southern California, and more about the even greater devastation of Tambora's eruption in the early 1800s that Winchester passes over quickly.<br />If you're looking for a book with pulse-pounding narrative, you may be disappointed.  To pass over the deaths of 36,000 people in true Hollywood-ish, page-turner style would have been a grave disservice--one that Winchester wisely sidesteps.  If, however, you settle into the book with a curious mind, you may find yourself thoroughly engrossed.  Between these hardbound covers, the sheer magnitude of the volcano's power explodes to the surface and flows down the slopes of each page with glowing, factual lava.  In the end, the account is worth every minute of reading time invested.	2003-05-30

Caley's book is a beautiful memoir with an arresting title and a melancholic cover.  Within five pages, I was entranced by her lean, effective prose.  I can relate to her church scars, and I anguished with her telling of the tale.  To see her young mother and cancer-weary father ousted by well-meaning Christians...it's a sad and not uncommon story.  Along life's path, Caley shows us that she has found some sense of peace regarding those years.  She never sugarcoats the pain or misdeeds, but she chooses wisely to hold back the bitter words of revenge.<br />\\"The House Where the Hardest Things Happened\\" starts with such clarity of vision, proceeds smoothly through defining moments in Caley's life, then closes with a scene or two that bring redemption full circle via her own daughters and her new church home.  Somehow, though, in conclusion, the book loses the steam that it builds.  This may be a reflection of Caley's own slow release of anger.  Or a symbol of her forgiveness at work.  For me, having come through similar frustrations in a religious upbringing, it seems that she holds back on facing those final, deepest anguishes.  She only brushes up against the subject of her gay brother.  She sheds little light on her siblings' reactions to the same mistreatment.  She shows so much grace--and for that I can only commend her--but she helps expose wounds many of us have faced, then leaves us only partially soothed.<br />Hey, Caley's writing can serve unapologetically as a balm.  You will appreciate every word.  If, however, you're hoping for soul-surgery, you'll still seek the aid of a Physician.<br />And maybe, just maybe, that's Caley's intent.	2003-05-27

Of course, I had to go back and read \\"Tell No One.\\"  Having quickly added this author to my must-read list, I was thrilled to see a new one.<br /><br />Let's start with the cover.  While it tries to be slick with a ransom note hidden beneath the dust-cover, it manages somehow to look more like a nonfiction title.  Hmmm.  Okay.  But if you open to the first page, if you read the first chapter, if you have any heart for a father in a terrible situation, you cannot fail to be hooked.  (Yeah, yeah, I know some reviewers here hated it.  Go back to Tolstoy and let us enjoy a great thriller, thank you very much!)<br /><br />Coben serves up another twisting conundrum of a modern mystery.  A man wakes up in the hospital twelve days after being shot only to discover that his wife has been murdered and his six-month old daughter is missing.  Soon, a ransom note appears and sets the stage for a rollercoaster of suspense and emotion.  Set in Coben's favorite location, the frontyards of suburban America, \\"No Second Chance\\" reads like a sordid tale from tomorrow's headlines.  Sure, Coben pushes the credibility on a few points, but the scariest thing is--and I think you'll have to agree--that so much of this could really happen.<br /><br />I'll admit this much: Coben's settings and basic themes are quite similar through his three big bestsellers.  But you'll have to admit this much in return: he does it better than ninety-nine percent of the other mystery writers out there.<br /><br />Just to prove my point, I'll send you my copy for free.  No wait, sorry, I changed my mind...and there will be \\"No Second Chance.\\"  Go buy a copy for yourself.	2003-05-23

Having just finished Grisham's latest, I asked myself how Randy Singer's new legal thriller would stack up.  Singer's first book, \\"Directed Verdict,\\" gave warning that he was a fresh and exciting voice in this genre.  Could he back it up with a second hit?<br />Yes, and again, yes!  Singer introduces us to Mitchell Taylor, fresh out of law school and applying for that coveted legal position.  But Taylor quickly finds himself frustrated, working for a glorified ambulance chaser.  What Taylor doesn't know is that he's about to represent a critical case in which cloning and woman's rights will be challenged from every angle.<br />Maryna is the beautiful and emotionally scarred illegal immigrant facing \\"irreparable harm.\\"  Her story, along with journal entries, is the beating heart of this novel.  Maryna not only faces a violent past, she faces an unknown future as she carries a surrogate child.  The child's mother discovers that this baby could have Down's syndrome and wants Maryna to \\"terminate\\" the pregnancy so that she can pursue a healthy child with cloned cells.  The legal battles that ensue are only part of the conflict involved.<br />Singer handles the legal aspects with aplomb, and he does a fine job of educating us about cloning procedures.  He particularly shines, though, when he dashes the dialogue with humor, and when his characters succumb to the dangers of romance and emotion.  Without getting sappy, Singer makes us care for Taylor and Maryna.  He threads many plot ideas together, creating a complex story--even if one or two threads remained a bit frayed in conclusion.  For example, what ever happened to Maryna's would-be abductors?<br />By the story's end, Singer throws us some wonderful curveballs and change-ups.  His narrative rarely lets up, and he rewards us with emotional payoffs.  He gives us characters we don't want to leave--and reintrodues a few from his first book.  On the last page, he drops some strong hints that we'll be learning more about some of these characters in his next book.  I can't wait!<br />Singer, like Grisham, gives us serious issues to consider, while never forgeting to focus on human stories amidst the legal finagling.  He serves up a hefty feast, but by the end leaves us wanting more.  Hmm...I see no harm in that!some of these characters in his next book.  I can't wait!<br />Singer, like Grisham, gives us serious issues to consider, while never forgeting to focus on human stories amidst the legal finagling.

That was my question as I bought \\"The King of Torts.\\"  Reviews of this book range from one extreme to the other, and, after laboring through \\"The Summons\\" (thin plot) and \\"The Brethren\\" (no protagonist), I feared this latest would be a disappointment too.<br />What a pleasant surprise.  Grisham opens with a random killing, drags in an unwilling public defendant, then mixes it up with a global corporate coverup and millions of dollars at stake...I was hooked.<br />Clay Carter is our sympathetic hero, a man wrestling for recognition and love.  He rises meteorically to the status of multi-millionaire when he uses insider information to file a class-action lawsuit against a pharmaceutical giant.  Despite the sudden riches, he despises the greed in the mass tort law industry, and he also bemoans the loss of his girlfriend.  Soon, however, the temptations drag him down into the very quagmire he despises, and Clay finds himself to the be one of the villains he swore never to be.<br />\\"The King of Torts\\" takes on the form of a modern morality play, a bit preachy but effective.  At times, it reads more like a nonfiction account...very believable, but clinical in its presentation of facts.  Other times, Grisham reconnects with the passion and emotion of his earlier classics.  Although he leaves a few plot threads hanging--whatever happens to Max Pace, for example?--he swings mightily and accurately in this latest novel.  Maybe he hasn't lost the legal touch after all!	2003-05-18

The story follows Kevin, a seminary student, who wrestles with the concepts of good and evil.  Before he can face his inner self, he finds himself taunted by a ruthless killer who gives him three minutes to confess his sin.  What sin?  Kevin soon realizes that this game is deadly and very real.  He must face his own dark secrets if he is to have a hope of surviving.<br />2) What author will rock your reading world this summer?<br />Easy.  Ted Dekker is the obvious answer.  In this latest of his, he surpasses his other books for sheer narrative force.  With a seemingly simple idea, he takes you on a rollercoaster that will leave your head spinning by the end.  This high-speed thrill-ride left me smiling in begrudging amusement at his clever plot twists.  Each time I thought I knew where the story was headed, it took another turn.  If you think the ride begins to slow down, then hold on...It's about to whip you through another loop.  Along the way, Dekker paints a grim and realistic portrayal of a disturbed young man and his repressive past.<br />3) What storyline gains philosophical power with each twist of the plot?<br />This novel is one of those rarities, a book that thrills while also causing you to examine deeply your views of good and evil, right and wrong, and the effects of morality on us all.  For a book that delivers everything a good thriller should, and more, you have to pick up this book.  I read it in two sittings, and I'm buying copies for my friends.	2003-05-14

Set in 17th century Amsterdam, \\"The Coffee Trader\\" is a delicious historical novel.  Liss takes us on a romp through the alleyways and taverns of the renowned city, divvying out details without becoming burdensome.  Having lived in Amsterdam myself, I loved every nuance of the city and its history.  What a heady brew!<br />The story follows Miguel Lienzo, a Portuguese Jew, who has aspirations of making his fortune in the exciting new business of stocks and futures.  With recent setbacks still weighing on his mind, he knows he must come up with something financially worthwhile.  Soon, he is enticed into a risky scheme by a Dutch woman named Geertruide.  She introduces him to the seductive taste and aroma of coffee.  Together, they plan to monopolize this commodity and make a fortune.<br />All is not as it seems, however, and betrayal lurks around every corner.  As Miguel finds himself increasingly entwined with the fortunes and misfortunes of others, he realizes that one false move could bring his schemes down upon his own head.<br />Two other narrators add depth to this seemingly simple storyline.  First, Miguel's sister-in-law stumbles upon his new commodity, providing some humorous insights into the effects of coffee.  She also shows us the oppression of the time-period, and a believable uprising against her husband and his culture.  Troubles increase when she finds herself attracted to Miguel.  Second, a shady character named Alferonda offers us journal excerpts to expose the full scope of the schemers at work.  This plot device works, but seems disjointed at times.<br />By the novel's end, Miguel reaps his just rewards and punishments, and the author keeps a few surprises up his sleeve.  Although a former era is depicted, I kept thinking how relevant the story is to the greed and manipulation of today's business world.  Not to mention the corruptions of the human heart.  I applaud Liss in his ability to dovetail these themes under the guise of entertaining fiction.  Well done!on.  Well done!	2003-05-13

I'm a big fan of Lawhead's &quot;The Iron Lance&quot; and his &quot;Song of Albion&quot; series.  With high hopes, I purchased this historical novel.  My knowledge of St. Patrick is limited, and I looked forward to discovering more of his life and his spiritual influence in Ireland.<br />&quot;Patrick: Son of Ireland&quot; does many things well.  The settings are believable and well-researched, the language fluid, and the dry details turned into fascinating tidbits.  I particularly enjoyed the Roman battle scenes and descriptions of the Plague.  Sobering stuff.  Succat, later known as Patrick, is a character with flaws and foibles, a man who grows slowly into the understanding of his calling.  And when Succat comes to a final point of humility and turning, Lawhead paints a succint and touching scene.  He employs Pelagius, who plays a minimal part in only the final thirty pages of the book, to address Succat: &quot;You have learned what a man can do in his own strength...Perhaps now it is time to learn what God can do with a man who knows the limits of his strength.&quot;<br />Unfortunately, the book never allows us to see the result of this turning.  We witness years of futility in Succat's life, and, in fact, we ourselves grow weary of his attempts to escape slavery and of the deceits he thrusts upon even those he claims to love.  I appreciate that all this brings Succat to a medieval mid-life crisis, but I would've enjoyed seeing the working out of his newfound knowledge.  I even started to suspect that Lawhead would be throwing a sequel our way.  Instead, he throws us a bone--a prologue and epilogue that tidily skim over Patrick's years of hard spiritual work.<br />I trod my way along the arduous trails of Succat's life, found some wisdom to be gained and some eventual rewards, but felt cheated by the blithe conclusion.  Am I missing a sequel, or is this all we get?	2003-05-11

I have testosterone flowing through my frame as surely as estrogen flows through this book's intended audience.  Is it wrong, then, for me to love this story?<br />After numerous people told me to try it, I succumbed to the sweet temptation.  I was drawn in quickly by young Lily's struggles in a single-parent home, and by her guilt pertaining to her mother's death.  Then, when Lily and proud, black Rosaleen find themselves as fugitives to the law--and lawless, violent men--I knew I was hooked.  Their subsequent steps on a journey of discovery lead them to a beekeeping farm, where a trio of eccentric women will challenge and change their lives forever.<br />Although the writing is rich and smooth, it is also honest and hard-hitting.  I never doubted the characters' motivations or actions.  Scene by scene, Kidd builds a powerful story of secrets and family, love and redemption.  Along the way, she flirts with elements of a mystery book.  I was smitten.<br />I found myself marking page after page to share with my wife: \\"You've gotta hear this description.\\"  \\"Listen to this...this is life-wisdom.\\"  Sometimes, I just leaned back and shook my head.  \\"This is gooood stuff,\\" I'd say quietly, before returning to the story.<br />A story written by a woman, about women, marketed to women...<br />This man happened to love every page of it, even if I was left wanting more in the concluding scene.  But honey has that sort of effect.	2003-05-06

Even worse, I've read only one other Alex Delaware novel, \\"The Web\\"--I'm told it's one of the weakest--so I can't provide deep insight into the series.  This new entry does stand alone, though, and I recommend it to other newbies such as me.<br />Despite my lukewarm response to the previous Delaware book, I decided to give \\"The Murder Book\\" a try.  Even in \\"The Web\\" I liked Kellerman's prose and characterization, but nothing hooked me.  Here, Kellerman ensnared me quickly with his murder book concept.  Although I'm not terribly familiar with the relationships between Alex and Milo and Robin, I did find myself emotionally involved in the outcome of their personal struggles.  Alex and Robin are estranged by distance and emotionally barriers--a briefly, but believably handled struggle; Alex and Milo are taunted by the unexpected arrival of the murder book, reopening a twenty-year old homicide case; and Milo is forced to face his past failures and insecurities as a gay police officer in West LA...a portrayal that is not only nuanced and without cliche, but somehow remains PG rated for the easily offended.<br />I sped through this mystery.  Having once lived in that sprawling metropolis of Los Angeles, I found myself back on the streets as I read through the book.  I believed the story Kellerman told.  He slowly unfolds the magnitude of the murder coverup, then begins to cinch the strings together until all are caught up in the same net of intrigue.  The finale was satisfying and just, and I found myself wanting more of the Alex Delaware series.<br />For now, I'm just the guy in the backseat yelling out my thoughts.  Give me a chance behind the wheel, though, and I have a feeling I could speed through this series in a heartbeat.	2003-04-30

In fact, having received this book as a gift, I took my time getting around to it.<br />Too bad.  Buchanan's writing is smooth and beautiful.  He weaves words with rare skill, communicating deep thoughts with sparkling threads of sentences.  Quickly, we are wrapping ourselves in these thoughts.  He reminds us that heaven is our goal, that we are not intended for ultimate fulfilment on this earth but for a celestial culmination in God's presence.<br />Ah, the warmth of it all.  Except...<br />Except that Buchanan does not only encourage us for the hereafter, he challenges us in the here and now.  His threads, so warm and comforting, become earthy and gritty clothing by which we march on into each day with a purpose.  This is what makes &quot;Things Unseen&quot; so moving.  The book demands that we realign our perspective.  Buchanan tears down our facades and tells us to be so earthly minded that we are of some heavenly good.<br />I was inspired and convicted by the truths in these pages.  Heaven is real...What a beautiful sight!  And what a source of motivation for our lives here on earth.	2003-04-16

Nope, me neither.  Although most of these books are odes to dedication and good intentions, they are not always well done.<br />\\"Conquest of Paradise\\" comes close to bucking the trend.<br />Britt Gillette proves that he can complete a story and with writing flare that improves as the book progress.  Occasionally clumsy, and not without grammatical errors, the narrative still moves along nicely.<br />The basic plot: nanotechnology is on the verge of a breakthrough, thus making all other weapon-systems obsolete.  Raphael Vicente, leader of a successful revolution and surprise nominee for the guidance of United Europe, finds himself at the helm of the planet.  With good intentions, he sets out to disarm terrorism and bring global peace.  Of course, things never work out that easily; a lone terrorist is on the loose ready to pull the nano-trigger himself.  To further complicate issues, Britt Gillette sets out to follow loosely the end-time prophecies of the Bible.<br />The first 100 pages are the biggest problem here.  In a word: boooring!  I almost gave up, but other reviews here encouraged me to persevere.  I'm glad I did so because Gillette does pull off some nice prophetic twists, and he opens our eyes to some frightening realities on the technological horizon.  While never breaking down nanotechnology with the ease of Michael Crichton's \\"Prey,\\" Gillette does communicate effectively the inherent dangers.  He forms this idea into a workable \\"end-times nano-thriller,\\" as the front cover boldly proclaims.<br />I'm impressed by Gillette's concept and realization.  However, in \\"Conquest of Paradise\\" he tries to do too much back-story up front, then leaves us without much characterization as his nano-plot takes over.  If he continues to write, I'll give another book a shot.  I believe that with back-story and character woven throughout the plot instead of before it, he could have himself a winner.  And a publishing deal, as well!e it, he could have himself a winner.  And a publishing deal, as well!	2003-04-07

Dan Brown sinks the hooks in and drags us through the night hours with a plot that won't let go.<br />\\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" like Ludlum's classic \\"The Gemini Contenders,\\" deals with secrets within secrets of the Catholic Church.  In this case, the Church has tried to suppress certain relics that would cause embarrassment and doubt for many of its billion believers.  The relics, discovered by the Knights Templar during the Crusades, have been entrusted to a line of guardians to this present age.  The problem: the guardians are being murdered, threatening the knowledge of this ancient secret.  When a renowned symbologist and a female cryptologist find themselves joined at a murder scene in the Louvre, they are about to go on a twenty-four hour dash for their lives and for the survival of the secret, as hinted at by the Da Vinci Code.<br />Brown not only keeps the pace at a gallop for the full 454 pages, he deals out clues and deceptions and word games like a Vegas dealer flipping cards.  (In fact, the origin of the four suits of cards is even broached in this fascinating book!)  Somehow, with mesmerizing skill, Brown draws us deeper into the mystery without setting our heads spinning.  But you might find yourself nodding, smiling, and gasping in reaction.<br />Ultimately, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" swings the pendulum from run-of-the-mill thriller to a discourse on religious roots.  Yes, I believe the Church has put forth a male-dominant view of God that is inconsistent with the Bible.  The Bibles states in Genesis that both man and woman were created in God's image.  Where Brown, or his Knights Templar, might swing too far the other way is in asserting God as the sacred goddess instead.  Biblically, yes, God is spirit, encapsulating all the traits of man and woman in the divine.  However, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" dips into pagan practices and gnosticism, calling into question the veracity of Scripture.<br />As a thriller, this book can hardly be beat.  As a treatise on spirituality, it comes up suspect on factual and theological levels.into question the veracity of Scripture.<br />As a thriller, this book can hardly be beat.

The cloning of Christ was explored with great creativity in BeauSeigneur's \\"The Christ Clone Trilogy,\\" but it lacked masterful prose.  The more recent \\"Cloning Christ\\" shoots for the stars and misses just about everything.<br />\\"The Jesus Thief\\" restores freshness to this cloning concept.  Instead of resorting to Armageddon scenarios or international conspiracies, Lankford focuses on real people and real details of cloning.  In doing so, she hooked me on an earthy and vital story.<br />The story revolves around Felix Rossi, a microbiologist who happens to steal blood-stained threads from the Shroud of Turin in hopes of cloning Christ.  His difficulties come from his girlfriend, his sister, his landlord, his doorman...and his black maid.  In other words, this story deals with actual life situations and emotions.<br />Soon, Rossi acquires the hostess for his cloning project, but has trouble keeping the secret from a nosy reporter and religious do-gooders.  The pages turn quickly, leading to a bloody, yet miraculous conclusion that raises hope while never becoming \\"too heavenly minded for any earthly good.\\"<br />Lankford is a wonderful tale-spinner and weaver of words.  Her prose is smooth and rich, the dialogue believable, the medical details credible.  Characters such as Maggie, the maid, and Sam, the doorman, seem like people you'd meet on any given day.<br />I loved this book.  Although I admire the author's inclusive and non-judgmental approach to all religions, I think she might step on a few toes by putting Christ and Buddha on the same plane.  I respect her heart, while not necessarily agreeing with her views.  Some might also be put off by occasional foul language and maturely portrayed sexual situations, but most will appreciate the honest and no-punches-pulled account of \\"The Jesus Thief.\\"<br /><br />I say, buy this one.  It's a steal!<br />...	2003-04-02

Well, this novel has little to do with its title. While it has chances to explore theological and ethical issues, it bypasses those and dishes up a B-version of a cheap bombs-and-bullets thrill ride. It quickly becomes one overextended chase scene.<br />I tried to enjoy this, I really did, but it nosedived after the first chapter.  Max Train, a geneticist who happens to also do archeaological work, discovers what he believes to be the True Cross, and within hours he has assassins on his tail--even though he's told no one of the artifact's existence. The authors do attempt to give Train some motivation and character, but it falls flat after he becomes an international fugitive. (Luckily for poor Max, he knows how to bounce over borders like a wind-up toy, smoothly carrying the True Cross under his arm.)<br />Still, I might have enjoyed the improbable chase if it had led to true innovations on the cloning theme. The ideas here are latent with theological depth and power. Unfortunately, we never see any of it. We do see a bloodthirsty bad guy, The Scorpion, who is able to easily kill everyone around Max Train, but fails to ever get Max. (It's similar to those \\"A-Team\\" shows where helicoptor fire follows the running man on the ground but never quite catches up. Yawn!)<br />Aside from the grammatical errors, the overuse of adverbs and adjectives, the point-of-view mistakes, and the thin plot, I had to groan at the ridiculous scenarios that pop up throughout. For example, early on Max pulls into an Israeli gas station and hides in the restroom to deal with a bullet lodged in his leg. Fortunately--how very fortunate!--he sees a pair of needle-nose pliers on the ground and uses them to remove the bullet. After scenes like this, I never truly doubted that the writers would let Max off the hook. In fact, I stopped caring soon after that.<br />For a much more involved and believable thriller, try \\"The Christ Clone Trilogy\\" by James BeauSeigneur. The writing is so-so, but the story is great. For a literary approach to the same subject, try \\"The Jesus Thief\\" by JR Lankford. The characters are three-dimensional, and the cloning aspect is explored with medical detail.<br />As for \\"Cloning Christ,\\" I tip my hat to any writer who actually sits down and completes a novel.  If the authors had taken the time to let a good editor mop this up, the story would've been greatly enhanced.  For me, too much of too little became far too long.

Margolin, knowing his audience, slices his novels into manageable snacks for those on the go. Each book is fluid and credible, with characters we care just enough to follow and plots we try desperately to unravel.<br />\\"Ties That Bind\\" is vintage Margolin. From the opening scenes which undergird a far-reaching conspiracy, to the concluding surprises, Margolin lets us revisit Amanda Jaffe (from \\"Wild Justice\\") as she finds herself embroiled in trouble. When she agrees to defend a man, owner of an escort service, against murder charges, she finds cover-ups and misdirection on every side. Amanda must face her own fears and grow through her experiences.<br />Amanda, though, is almost secondary to the stronger characterization of Tim Kerrigan. Tim is a man with a football-hero past, a temptation-paved present, and little hope for the future. He finds himself a pawn in a deadly game. His own poor choices place his family in danger, and he must find a way to extricate himself before his guilt crushes him once and for all.<br />While \\"Ties That Bind\\" addresses family, moral, and political issues in short snippets, it's really all about telling an adrenaline-charged story. Though there's little time to get emotionally involved, Margolin manages to draw us onward and throw us for a few loops. The style is gritty, sometimes twisted...and one heck of a ride.	2003-03-27

I cracked open this British-style courtroom mystery leaving lots of room for grace.<br />Indeed, \\"Final Witness\\" drew me into its mystery aspects quickly.  I was intrigued by the murder of Lady Anne and the subsequent accusations by her son that Sir Peter's assistant/future lover was responsible.  On the surface, things seemed straightforward, but the jacket cover and reviewers assured me that unexpected twists lie ahead.  I plugged along, waiting for two things to happen: 1) for the characters to make me care about their individual fates, 2) for the plot to take me on divergent paths.<br />Unfortunately, neither happened.<br />Despite well-drawn characters, efficient prose, and a passable plot, I failed to be moved or surprised.  I also had a hard time hurdling the issue of a man proposing to his lover on the day of his murdered wife's funeral.<br />I seem to be in the minority, but \\"Final Witness\\" left me feeling strangely apathetic.  Due to Simon Tolkien's writing ability, I'd try a second novel, but hope for more of the human touch.  Or less of that dry British one.	2003-03-19

Drawing on the work of old masters, such as Ludlum's \\"The Gemini Contenders\\" and Morris West's \\"The Shoes of the Fisherman,\\" Silva gives us a tale of intrigue that uses the secrets of the Vatican as a backdrop.<br />Silva is unflinching in his approach to the abuses of religious power, yet he maintains an air of respect for the Church through the eyes of his characters.  The story revolves around the death of an old man in Munich, a writer who had been researching a secretive project.  Gabriel Allon, assassin for the Israeli secret service, returns in his third novel, and finds himself caught in the crosshairs as he tries to unravel the deceptions surrounding the man's death.  What he discovers will lead him into the heart of the Vatican, both as a hunted man and a protector of the hunted.  Ultimately, he will be the confessor to the leader of Catholicism.<br />The story is nicely plotted and paced, and Silva deftly balances his revelations with respect.  He touches on powerful issues without ever seeming to be a man with an ax to grind.<br />Unfortunately for me, however, the book did not captivate me the way other Silva novels have.  Perhaps it's the lack of a genuine love interest; perhaps it's the lower stakes for Allon's character...Most likely, it was the somewhat protracted and stilted showdown between villain and protagonist.  Despite great moments along the way, this novel does not rate as my favorite Silva thriller.<br />Still, even a rung down from his best, this is better and more thought-provoking than most other espionage fiction out there.	2003-03-10
1212903:US	50287514	RKEWQVY5H6T2T	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Exquisitely Grounded	In \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" Alice Sebold captures heartache and tragedy with all the fervor of one who's been there.  As the title suggests, this book is beautiful, full of the exquisite writing found in great literature...and, more impressively, it is gritty, with the earthiness of a classic mystery.  Being a male reader, I feared a melodramatic approach; I found instead a meditative directness.<br />The story starts with an unusual form of narration: a first person omniscient viewpoint.  Susie Salmon, a fourteen year old girl brutally murdered by a neighbor, tells us the story from a personal point of view that, nevertheless, allows us to see into the minds and motives of the other characters as Susie observes them from heaven.  Although the story starts dispassionately, I found this method effective.  As readers, we are able to digest the facts without becoming overwhelmed.  Sebold slowly unveils the emotion and heart in the story, using her unique narrator's perceptions to delve into the details surrounding both sides of the murder.<br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" surprised me in a number of aspects.  It refrained from sappiness, while squeezing emotion from numerous scenes.  It kept me in suspense, while avoiding the obvious solutions.  It confronted me with insights into family and life and the passage of time.  Although I'm not sure that the view of heaven--a somewhat reserved and mundane portrayal--parallels my own views and those I find in the Bible, it does address issues of forgiveness and redemption, of healing and honesty.<br />Finally, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" takes chances.  Sebold uses a bold approach and a tricky act toward the end to keep us riveted in our seats.  Some readers may want a more tangible conclusion, but I applaud the writer's ability to stretch our thinking beyond our finite world.  Only one such as Sebold, one who has confronted horror and pain, could be so exquisitely grounded.  The title says it all.	2003-02-27

After reading \\"Gone for Good,\\" I was certain Coben knew how to tell a riveting, tightly-twisting tale.  Now, having gone backwards chronologically to read \\"Tell No One,\\" I'm convinced...This guy's good!<br />\\"Tell No One\\" cranks up the adrenaline levels, but never forgets that it's dealing with real people.  We follow Dr. David Beck's attempts to uncover the truth of his wife's murder eight years previous.  Out of the blue, Beck is receiving emails that imply Elizabeth is actually alive.  The more he tries to figure things out, the more deadly the game becomes, the more shady each character's actions seem.  Coben's secret is that he makes us care about these characters.  The resulting suspense is more than cheap Hollywood thrills; it's unabashed concern--gulp, even emotion--for this story of love and terror and redemption.<br />As usual, Coben doesn't let us relax too much.  He not only keeps the humor and social insights coming, he twists us around with one plot twist after another.  He may use larger than life villians to add a sense of danger, but he uses very real, normal protagonists to drive the story--and these very real, normal people do very real, not so normal things.  Almost everyone has a secret to hide, and the reader has the pleasure of watching the story unfold.<br />Once again, Harlan Coben shows his stuff.  In the end, we are left with a deeply satisfying tale that ticks with the precision of a Swiss timepiece, yet continues to beat with the heart of its characters.	2003-02-19

I was soon sucked into the story, riveted by the attack on the president and the ensuing global consequences.  The plot zips along, the characters play their expected--somewhat predictable--roles, and the climax promised to be memorable.  I was impressed with the author's ability to weave in Christian themes without sounding preachy.  In many ways, this book equalled \\"Mission Compromised\\" by Oliver North.<br />Unfortunately, the last fifty pages were a letdown.  Yes, the pace kept racing, but inconsistencies detracted from my enjoyment.  For example, throughout the book Rosenberg teases us with scenes of \\"the four horsemen,\\" some of the world's most feared terrorists, as they maneuver toward a deadly goal.  Here's the thing: their target is not even scheduled to be in any specific location until well after the \\"horsemen\\" begin heading that direction.  The sudden and abrupt conclusion left room for a sequel, yet it left me feeling rushed, as though the author built up all the questions and possibilities surrounding nuclear war, then closed the story before having to respond to the aftermath.<br />These frustrations aside, \\"The Last Jihad\\" was a quick and easy read, with pertinent political and spiritual points.  If you don't have time to dig deep into a Clancy classic, this book will more than ease your appetite.	2003-02-12

Those who enjoy a sense of place and a well-woven plot will appreciate the time spent in the world of Father Griffin Reed.<br />Father Grif is a likeable and sympathetic protagonist, a widower, a minister, thrown into a macabre scene of murder.  A famous writer is dead, and the list of suspects grows along with the story.  Soon, despite Grif's brooding and melancholic nature, he finds himself putting together the pieces of the victim's life--and putting his own life back together as well.<br />If you're looking for fast-paced action and violence, you've come to the wrong place.  If you're ready for something a little slower, a little deeper, with even a hint or two of romance, this is a book you'll enjoy.  It ends nicely, but with plenty of hooks to drag you to the sequel \\"The Judas Tree.\\"	2003-02-05

Two years ago, I stumbled upon the self-published versions of \\"The Christ Clone Trilogy\\" and loved the premise.  When live dermal cells are discovered on the Shroud of Turin, an agnostic scientist clones them, leading to the arrival of a Christ clone.  Is this child an offspring of God?  A replica of an advanced and ancient race?  Or something more sinister?<br />The plot blew away shallow attempts at End Times fiction--I won't get too specific, but BeauSeigneur \\"left behind\\" the competition!--and the themes explored were far-reaching in their implications.<br />Alas, the writing and editing were weak, the presentation inferior, and the marketing limited.<br />The news of a major publisher getting behind this trilogy thrilled me.  I hoped that a good editor and a bigger advertising budget might bring this series the wide attention it deserves.  With some hesitation, I passed along my cheaper paperbacks and plunked down the money for the hardcover.<br />Yes!  This book is worth every penny.  The cover and layout look great.  The text is much smoother.  Although the professional editing could've been more extensive, it does make this book that much better; also, so as not to alienate some of the intended audience, the publishers sliced away minor profanity.<br />I hope this new look leads to big things, because \\"In His Image\\" and the remainder of the trilogy represent some of the most gripping and memorable fiction I've ever come across.  If you've never read this, you're in for some mindblowing entertainment.  If you've already discovered the series, you'll love the sleeker packaging and tighter storytelling.	2003-01-27

It has the cumbersome start of &quot;Heaven's Wager,&quot; the chase across the desert of &quot;A Man Called Blessed,&quot; and the slam-bang finale of &quot;Thunder of Heaven.&quot;  What lifts it above his previous work is the melding of a spiritual message as potent as &quot;When Heaven Weeps&quot; (my personal favorite).<br />The story belongs to a man and a woman, who, predictably, will fall in love.  What makes their tale interesting is the manner in which Dekker weaves their opposing worlds and spiritual struggles as they rely on one another for survival.  The woman is Miriam, a Saudi Arabian woman on the run from her would-be husband and Islamic fundamentalists.  The man is Seth Borders, a genius with an unexplained ability to see potential futures.  When Seth's &quot;gift&quot; emerges at a dinner party, he finds himself a guardian for Miriam.<br />The inerrancy of Seth's foresight saps any true suspense in spots, and the manner in which the pair are finally ambushed in Las Vegas is suspect on the logical level (more detail would give things away).  The interaction between the characters is enjoyable, however, and their joint struggle to understand faith in God is worth following.  Seth starts off believing in an intricate--therefore deistic--design of the universe, but when the future becomes open to him, he questions the existence of a God who does not know the future exactly.  In truth, Seth's &quot;gift&quot; is only another example, albeit an extreme one, of free will, but Dekker uses this plot device effectively to examine deeper truths of faith...ie, believing in the unseen.<br />&quot;Blink&quot; races toward a twisting, sweaty-palm finale.  Although the conclusion is never in real doubt, the route Dekker takes us along keeps us whipping through the pages.  If you've enjoyed his other books, this book is a culmination of his best.  If you need to strap on your seat belt for his upcoming &quot;Three&quot; (May 2003), then you better do it with &quot;Blink,&quot; because &quot;Three&quot; takes it to an entire new level.ing &quot;Three&quot; (May 2003), then you better do it with &quot;Blink,&quot; because &quot;Three&quot; takes it to an entire new level.	2003-01-26

These guys are NY Times bestsellers.  After reading Brouwer's Nick Barrett mysteries, I believe he has reached the same level of writing.  He deserves a wide audience for this masterful tale.<br />The story quickly introduces us to two damsels in distress--except neither woman is weak or cowardly.  In fact, Angel and Retha are two memorable and likeable characters.  Both are trying to protect children in their care; both are threatened by violent, outside forces.<br /><br />Enter Nick Barrett.  Barrett is a three-dimensional man, born of questionable parentage and raised in an atmosphere of subtle bigotry and pride.  He is trying to stay afloat emotionally.  As he finds himself involved in the lives of Angel and Retha, he must face his fears, his doubts, and his faith.<br />Voodoo doctors, cult members, and bitter high society players all join in the action as the mysteries unfold.  The city of Charleston is a character in the tale.  As the climax nears, the plot twists turn tighter, the surprises mount, and--for this reader--the emotional impact swelled.<br />Like the two aforementioned bestselling writers, Brouwer mixes his gritty story with heart and warmth.  Not even the half-dozen punctuation and spelling errors could keep me from sinking myself into Brouwer's fictional world.  When I turned the final page, I closed my eyes and said aloud, \\"That is one darrrrn good book!\\"  And I meant it.	2003-01-21

Davis Bunn creates believable characters, explores levels of motivation and emotion, and tries to tie it all together with a legal mystery.<br />The prime players: Erin Brandt, an opera diva, with a determination that overrides even family bonds; Dale Steadman, a CEO under fire, both personally and professionally; Marcus Glenwood, our trusty lawyer friend; and Kirsten Stansted, his fiancee, who struggles with secrets from the past.  When Steadman's child is kidnapped by his ex-wife, Erin, Marcus and Kirsten become entangled in a mystery with far-reaching implications.<br />Bunn struggles to maintain the same level of depth that he accomplished in &quot;The Great Divide.&quot;  New characters--mostly unlikeable ones--weigh the story down, and certain stretches in plausibility (a mother with not one ounce of concern for her infant child was a hard sell for me) became distractions.  As the story progressed, my attentions shifted to Marcus' fiancee, Kirsten Stansted, and I wished the story had been centered from the beginning around her personal struggles.<br />As in &quot;The Great Divide&quot; and &quot;Drummer in the Dark&quot; (my personal favorite), Bunn has a way of drawing us into worlds unfamiliar and making them interesting.  &quot;Winner Take All&quot; actually gave me more interest in the world of opera.  Bunn spices his well-crafted narratives with scenes of suspense and true drama, but the two previously mentioned books might be better introductions to his work.  In &quot;Winner Take All,&quot; he hits the high, and the low, notes.  If you're a fan, though, this book is a welcome addition.	2003-01-21

Perry Sachs, a wealthy engineer, stumbles upon a mugging in a Seattle alleyway, and finds himself the recipient of a historical secret.  Soon, he is in California's Tehachapi mountains excavating for the truth.  He finds resistance from the locals, in particular a feisty female mayor, and from unknown killers and kidnappers.  Despite some plot contrivances, the pace gains steam as it chugs toward the end of the line.<br />I like many of the things Gansky attempts: humor, suspense, faith issues, and light romance.  Occasionally, he distracts with contrived similes and sentences: &quot;his neck hurt like a bad tooth&quot; (?!), and &quot;There was a curse, a bang, a pop, a crash,and a scream.&quot; (What? This is all I get in a climactic scene?)  Some of his ideas would work better on the screen, where props and details are visible; in his books, I often find a lack of certain details that would add versimilitude to his grand concepts.<br />With these objections aside, I recommend &quot;A Treasure Deep&quot; for those seeking a quick, fun read that still has something worth saying about the the things in which we place our faith and love.  The genetic and artifact ideas have been often used, but Gansky gives them his own unique touch.	2003-01-18

Although Clark has never been exceptionally deep or thought-provoking in her novels, she never fails to entertain.  Her writing is concise and quick-moving, her plots full of intrigue and suspense.<br />I picked up &quot;Kitchen Privileges&quot; hoping for insight into Clark's background and the foundations of her writing career.  In typical fashion, she skims through the decades of her long and rich life with entertaining anecdotes and brief glimpses of grief.  She never fails to keep the pages moving, but she left me feeling like I'd waited for a five-course meal and discovered some tasty appetizers instead.<br />If you are a diehard Clark fan, you'll enjoy this opportunity to understand her a bit more.

From the onset, we find ourselves in new territory.<br />The story centers around Mike, a world-class cave-diver, and his love interest, Bridget Marceau--who happens to be deaf.  The pair have a longstanding relationship that begins to falter when Mike decides to return to the site of a past disaster in a 1000 foot deep cenote (a sinkhole leading into a cave system).  The tension builds as Mike finds his efforts hindered by Indian rituals, personal guilt, and a former acquaintance with a secret motive for guarding Cenote X.<br />The deep-diving scenes are well-written, full of awe and breathless moments.  The people in the story are believable.  Morrisey's writing is evocative, although an editor might have pared down some overwrought passages.  Here's one sentence as an example: &quot;Slowly, tenuously, its green skin folding and unfolding in the golden morning sunlight with wary hesitance, the iguana crept toward the ripe mango on the garden wall.&quot;  Five separate words communicate the same idea...but full credit for descriptive ability and mood-setting.<br />&quot;Yucatan Deep&quot; builds suspense, communicates spiritual truths, and introduces us to likeable characters.  Morrisey even throws in a few surprises at the end.  Although the story falters in the middle, it is one worth reading.  I look forward to Morrisey's future efforts.	2003-01-07

Despite my father's encouragement, I've taken this long to read a Koontz novel.  It was worth the wait.<br />&quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot; leaps forward from the first few pages.  Clearly, Koontz is one of those writers who knows how to start the story at the right spot--in the middle of the action.  Within twenty pages, he thrusts us into an otherworldly and suspenseful setting, where three young people will be altered forever.<br />The story begins when Jilly, Dylan, and Shep's lives collide in a motel where a mad-scientist type character injects them with &quot;stuff&quot; and promises that &quot;it does something different to everyone.&quot;  Indeed, Dylan begins to feel psychic spoors on objects he touches, Jilly sees visions/mirages, and Shep learns how to &quot;fold&quot; the world around him (read the book to find out more).  As they focus their abilities, the characters are bound together in a race to save lives and divert heartache and pain.<br />Koontz masterfully draws his characters, causing us to care for them and their predicament.  Shep is an autistic boy, Dylan is the brother committed to caring for him, and Jilly is the stand-up comedian who stumbles into their path.  Koontz lets his characters be themselves.  He lets us see into their pasts and into their hearts with effective timing and skill.  He keeps surprises up his sleeve, and divvies them out at appropriate moments.  Although he spices his writing with rich similes and metaphors that add to the mood and direction of the story, I did find the sheer volume of them distracting at times.<br />The climax of the book was my only disappointment.  The story moved from fringe characters in a predicament to &quot;The Matrix&quot; meets &quot;X-Men.&quot;  The scenes are handled deftly, and the bigger issues of fate and free-will are intriguing to contemplate, but Koontz's comic book ending undermined my enjoyment of the themes he explored.	2003-01-07

He gets his chance to prove himself, and to travel in his ancestors' footsteps, when he rounds up a ragtag team to accompany him on a search for a lost island.  When the team become castaways, they are forced to deal with moral and societal laws.  They face danger, fear, love, and hate.  On an adult scale, they deal with the issues of \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"  And Thorkild is Robinson Crusoe, struggling with his own soul amidst it all.<br />Morris West is a virtuouso of words.  Here, he shows all his strengths and weaknesses.  He reveals moral dilemmas and well-drawn characters, then occasionally burdens them with maudlin soap-opera type scenes.  His dialogue is dead-on most of the time, then turns melodramatic and Wagnerian.<br />I still love it.  West may reflect old-school sentiments, but he does so with zest.<br />I will dearly miss the man--the writer, the moralist, the entertainer.	2002-12-31

With those least common denominators addressed, I must emphasize the one trait I share with Winner. (Besides the love of books!) I, too, desire strongly for honesty and depth in my relationship with God. As a disenfranchised evangelical, I also hope to remove the trappings of religion and meet God.<br />Lauren Winner accomplishes many things in \\"Girl Meets God.\\" She opens the Jewish world to us. She paves the way to a liturgical Christianity. She displays faults and grace and respect all on the same pallet. Through the course of a year and her thoughts and experiences in regards to her faith, Winner sheds light into darkness. Her greatest accomplishment is giving us all hope that we can meet God as well, that he is not so far from any one of us. At times, her words move us to tears, other times to laughter and a wry smile. But underneath the humor and pathos lies a beating heart that reaches for the depths of Jesus and his desire for relationship.<br />Indeed, if \\"Girl Meets God,\\" then Boy can meet God. That's good news. And this is a wonderful book.	2002-12-24

Imagine the secret delight, the sense of discovery, the feeling of regaining something you'd totally forgotten about.<br />\\"Hornet Flight\\" is that sort of delight.  I was an early Follett fan, devouring \\"The Eye of the Needle,\\" \\"The Key to Rebecca,\\" and \\"The Man from St. Petersburg.\\"  His strengths--his characters, his detailed research, his pacing--kept me coming back for more.  Then, as Follett branched into other areas of fiction, my interest wavered.<br />The WWII theme of this latest book brought me back, and I discovered that forgotten \\"five dollar bill.\\"  The story revolves around young Harald Olafsun, a Danish man faced with the occupation of the Nazis and the bland apathy of many of his countrymen.  When he realizes that the Nazis have a new technology that gives them the edge in air-battles, when he finds himself entangled in a budding resistance movement, he uncovers his own courage and the surprising resilence of his fellow people...and the treachery of some of her trusted authorities.  Soon, Harald and an attractive Danish upperclass girl come to the realization that they alone have the ability to get invaluable info to the British by way of a dangerous flight in a dilapidated Hornet Moth.<br />\\"Hornet Flight\\" is not the most valuable thriller I've ever found, not the slickest or most modern, but it's a nice surprise all the same.  Follett's old skills are evident--characters we can believe, well-balanced pacing, and the details to make wartime Denmark seem touchable.  I'm sure glad I dug into these old pockets.  You just never know what you might find.	2002-12-21

He spins his tales, weaves his lies, and draws us in with the skill of a magician.  Dividing fact from fiction is not always easy in a work such as this.  \\"Roughing It\\" has moments of obvious hyperbole, grounded by stories of true difficulty.  Yet throughout, Twain finds a way to make us smile, even laugh out loud.  We are amused by the eccentric characters and turns of events which he describe, and find that we are not so far different as we might like to think.<br />The story follows Twain's journey as he travels west by stagecoach, train, wagon, horse, and ship.  He meets surly frontiersmen, murderers, thieves, fortune-hunters, and men of ill-repute.  Even here, he finds the good beneath the dirt.  I especially enjoyed his anecdote of Scotty Briggs, a man trying to hire a minister to attend over his friend's funeral.  Hilarious stuff!  And so true to human nature.<br />Throughout his account, Twain makes a habit of degrading his own work ethic, nudging us in the ribs as he highlights his aversion to labor.  With this in mind, the title seems to be a tongue-in-cheek affair.  In fact, I found his accounts much less rustic and more modern than expected.  Sure, we can travel across the U.S. quicker these days, but the politics and economics of Twain's age parallel our own.  Will we never learn?  Isn't this the point of history, to avoid repeating our errors?<br />Although criticized in his day for using coarse language and a working-class, Twain held to his guns and gave us some magnificent humor with which to swallow his pointed barbs.  He was a master satirist, and even in a travelogue such as this, his views shine through.  And thank goodness!  A century and a half later, I'm thankful for his insights.	2002-12-10

Having read almost all his fiction works, I found this story as engaging as ever.<br />We start off with Jack and Julia, a modern couple facing problems of family life. Jack is at home with the kids, while Julia deals with mounting work pressures and the possibilities for infidelity. Although both Jack and Julia have experience in groundbreaking technology, their story begins in a setting familiar to all, thus adding weight to the coming suspense.<br />Don't be mistaken, though; the suspense will come, and the usual technological ideas will reign. A highly-evolved swarm of nanoparticles has escaped from a secretive lab, and they are responding to predator-prey programming that Jack helped develop and Julia helped perfect. Along the way, Jack will be called in to help coordinate the counterattack against the swarm--if he and his team don't first become the prey.<br />This book starts off with more heart than usual for a Crichton book. I was fully involved by the time the true troubles came. The applications to society and technology are worthwhile to consider, and Crichton pulls out a few surprises by the end.<br />What he fails to do--to my chagrin--is sustain the sense of family and familiarity with which he starts the story. The concern we have for his kids soon falls away into a plot contrivance, and we find ourselves squarely in the middle of a regular Crichton story. A fun and fast-paced story it is, but it could've been even better if he continued with the human angle. Eventually, when the worst of the death toll hits, we find ourselves caring only on a superficial level. In fact, even Jack shows little emotional response.<br />Was I breathless at the climax? Yes. Did I actually care? Nah, not much. After all was said and done, it was a one-night stand of a book.  I felt like rolling over, lighting a cigarette, and trying not to consider the horrible consequences of Crichton's technology run-amok.tte, and trying not to consider the horrible consequences of Crichton's technology run-amok.	2002-12-03

He's a master of language, one of my favorite authors.  When I saw this newest outing, a departure from his other series, I was thrilled.<br />Early on, I wrapped myself in Burke's beautiful sentences, allowing myself to slip into the easygoing rhythm of his words.  I noticed immediately the familial connections to his other works, names that echo from the Robicheaux books all the way back to the Civil War.  I kept reading, waiting for these characters to draw me in.  They were evocative, yes, but I didn't find myself breathlessly waiting to see what befell them.<br />For me, this book was a disappointment.  This is the first time that I've felt I was reading about the same male characters in every Burke novel, just different names and costumes.  It was the first time I found myself skimming over many of his lengthy descriptions.  The one shining note was his brave and nuanced depiction of female characters.  This alone redeemed the book.  I believe he wrote this with the same passion he always does, I simply felt that the editors gave him free reign and allowed him to fall in love with his own writing.<br />Burke expects us to dig deep--for that I admire and respect him.  In &quot;White Doves at Morning&quot; he forgets that we can fill in some of the gaps ourselves--for that I feel jilted.  The fantastic writer that Burke is, I'm sure he'll serve up more great literature.  Here, I think he was consciously trying to do what he usually does so naturally.	2002-12-01

Whereas I felt \\"Blessed Child,\\" the prequel, dragged a bit, this book takes off and rarely slows down.<br />The story starts with two assassins on a collision course, with Caleb in the crosshairs.  One assassin is a Muslim intent on stopping the second, a female Israeli intent on uncovering the lost Ark of the Covenant.  As hinted at in \\"Blessed Child,\\" Caleb has information regarding the ark's whereabouts.  Soon, the Muslim and the Israeli descend upon his abode in a rebuilt Ethiopian monastery, and the tension mounts.<br />In the prequel, Caleb was a child so heavenly it was hard to relate to him.  For me, it was hard to even believe he was human.  In this book, Dekker lets us see a grown Caleb now struggling wiht his doubts.  This is a Caleb we can touch and relate to.  It's also a Caleb very desirable to a certain Jewish assassin woman.<br />Suspense, romance, faith, and extremism all play their parts in this well-spun novel.  The only complaint on my part: the fast paced scenes led to a mediocre crescendo.  The overall message of this book is a powerful one, though, and demands that we look beyond icons and relics (such as the recent \\"Jesus Box\\") and discover the Truth behind the religious facades.<br />Here's a quick peek at the future...<br />I've had a chance to read some of Dekker's up-and-coming work.  Watch out!  Everything up to this point has just been a teaser.  Don't miss his early stuff, but race to the store for his newest novels, \\"Blink\\" and \\"3\\".  You'll be blown away!	2002-11-26

Randy Singer offers a bright future for those of us who feel Grisham's latest legal thrillers have lost their sparkle.<br />&quot;Directed Verdict&quot; weighs in at 485 pages, but these pages turn quicker than most.  A brash young trial lawyer finds himself defending Sarah Reed, a woman who lost her husband while they were working as missionaries in Saudia Arabia.  Sarah's husband, already weakened by heart trouble, died due to interrogation by the Saudia Arabian secret police, and now she calls those responsible to account in the American courts.  (This idea is timely, in light of recent suits by Americans affected by Sept. 11.)<br />The premise seems straightforward, but Singer introduces numerous complications, keeping our interest and keeping things racing along.  Mixing the fast-paced, intricate plotting of original Grisham, the intriguing characters of Turow, and the humorous sprinkles of Meltzer, Singer creates a wonderful story.  The courtroom maneuvers are masterful.  The in-fighting and conniving are genuinely shrewd and nasty.  The plot twists are believable.  And, ultimately, the spiritual applications to our modern day world are noteworthy.<br />I hope Singer has more books coming, because I had a blast reading this one.	2002-11-21

I've heard him speak in person, and he communicates verbally with the same thoughtfulness that he does on the page.<br />Although &quot;Abraham&quot; is a quick and easy read, it offers deep wisdom and insight into the troubles of our religious struggles.  Don't read this book expecting to justify your position or bolster your particular brand of faith.  Feiler exposes too much dirt to give you that option.  Instead, he bolsters faith as a universal concept.<br />For those willing to join in constructive dialogue, Feiler sets the table with little-known facts as appetizers, then leads us to the main course of three religions.  Showing little favoritism, he sheds light on the errors of the Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike.  He outlines the need that these three religions have for Abraham.  He also outlines our need for this historical connection.  With words as drink, he washes down the bad taste of extremism and offers hope for something better.<br />I came away from this literary meal having discovered more about all three faiths, good and bad, and having found empathy and care for those that are different from me.  In light of recent terrorism, I think Feiler handles the truth wisely...never shrinking from the pain, never extinguishing grace.  He takes us into the thoughts of radicals and moderates on all sides.  We share in his hopelessness and anger; we follow along as he offers paths to peace.<br />No, &quot;Abraham&quot; doesn't throw out false hope for total reconciliation, but he does challenge us to seek for it individually.  One by one, we can make a difference.  I believe it's possible.  Bruce Feiler, for one, is beginning to do just that.	2002-11-19

I loved it.  I also enjoyed Ingermanson's &quot;Transgression.&quot;<br />&quot;The First Man&quot; has the most gripping premise yet.  I dove in with bated breath, awaiting the inevitable encounters with the fabled Martian life-form that the catalogues and cover and write-ups hinted at.  I plunked down hard cash for a peek at something new, even frightening.  Recently, I had fun reading Shane Johnson's &quot;Ice&quot; (which also has a sequel on the way), and I had full confidence that this book would deliver the same level of creativity.<br />From the start, the authors hook us with their familiar characters: Bob, Valkerie, Lex, and Kennedy.  The story begins, naturally, where the last left off--with the intrepid team of four on Mars.  Quickly, we begin to suspect that a fifth being, &quot;the fifth man,&quot; is lurking about on the mysterious red planet.  Suspicions and questions arise, romance fights for a foothold, tensions mount, and we move to the edges of our seats for the extraterrestrial showdown.  Two hundred pages into it...still waiting.  Three hundred...still waiting.  Faith wavering.<br />Ingermanson and Olson write with active verbage and tight storytelling.  The scientific issues are handled deftly, without pretense.  Though the authors occasionally sprinkle the mix with tired cliches and silly similes (&quot;his heart quivering like a bowlful of Santa's belly&quot;?!), the writing is above par for the Christian market.  These small errors I can overlook.<br />What I cannot overlook is the misleading title, cover, and premise.  Yes, the book offers satisfactory, supposedly even startling, explanations for all the goings-on, but it fails to live up to the promised thrills.

Shhh, don't tell anyone.<br />Ever since discovering &quot;Traveling Mercies,&quot; I've been an ardent Anne-Fan.  That said, I admit that her fiction has often read like thinly disguised nonfiction.  She recycles so many of her own experiences through her stories that it's hard not to imagine Anne as the protagonist of every novel she writes.  Sure, I enjoy her honesty, but I also want to escape into something new.<br />&quot;Blue Shoe&quot; is something new.  No doubt, we Anne-Fans see her shiny little face beaming/scowling/smirking/lusting through the pages of this book; however, Mattie, our recently divorced hero, is very much her own person.  The story follows her attempts to reconcile life with God, her ex, her kids, her mom...oh, and the Evergreen man.  Daniel doesn't want to be an Evergreen man.  Mattie wants him to be her man.  Daniel is married.  And Mattie's still sleeping with her ex when he calls.<br />These elements, linked with the startling similes and heartbreaking candor of Anne's prose, add up to her best fiction yet.  She deals with so many elements of betrayal and loss, love and hurt.  Anne's been there, and she knows how to take us there with her.  She meanders, she lets her characters stumble through life, she expects us to follow along.  If you have the ability to empathize with others, it's hard not to care about someone in this story.  Anyone.  Choose a character.  They all have their faults; they all have redeeming qualities.<br />I like truthfulness.  I like a pimple on a beautiful face.  I like to know that we are not all slaves to the picture perfect world our media tries to sell.<br />Thanks, Anne, for smiling and writing through the pain.  I'm still in love.  With this great new book, others are lining up behind me.	2002-11-14

Not only does \\"Interview with the Devil\\" keep us interested, it also educates us about the differences between the Muslim world and the Western mindset.<br />The story is straightforward.  Mark Taylor, a journalist, is given an assignment that no one else can fill.  At the request of one of the world's most ruthless Muslim extremists, Taylor has the opportunity to interview the man responsible for thousands of deaths.  With fear, he accepts.  Then the complications begin...his wife's new pregnancy, the CIA's request that he aid in an assassination attempt, etc.  Although there are only a few surprises along the way, the story moves smoothly and rapidly.  Blood is shed, lessons are learned, lives are saved, and...well, I can't tell you everything!<br />Despite a few editorial discrepancies (failing to capitalize the branches of the armed forces, for example), I'm impressed at the great work coming out from Promise Press Fiction.  Like Jefferson Scott's \\"Operation: Firebrand,\\" this novel tackles military issues in a mature and entertaining fashion.  Sure, I think a higher death toll at the end would've been more believable, but Jacobsen does let us see some true casualties of this ideological war.  With sensitivity, he also makes sure not to pigeonhole every Muslim.  His characters represent both sides of the Islamic and Western coin, and he deserves high praise for that feat alone.<br />If you're looking for a loose, easy, and fun read (that somehow manages to provide insight along the way), pick up \\"Interview with the Devil.\\"	2002-11-09

This was my first Coben book, so I can't compare it to \\"Tell No One.\\"  I cannot tell you if it's a rerun of his previous plots.  I can tell you that this is a superb thriller.<br />Part thriller, fully a mystery, \\"Gone for Good\\" starts with Will Klein's discovery that his older brother is perhaps still alive.  The questions mount:  How did his brother die?  Was he really guilty of murdering a teenage girl?  And the answers come only quick enough to lead to other questions.<br />When you think there are no more questions, you're wrong.<br />When you think you have all the answers, you're wrong.<br />Coben writes with a deceptively easy style.  He writes with a quick pace, yet never forgets to give his characters heart.  I found myself caring for these people, even feeling emotions in my throat once or twice.  He paints with a broad brush, showing rage, love, pain, sorrow, twisted violence, and family concern.<br />If you haven't read Coben, I'm sure you'll enjoy this book as much as I did.  If you're already a fan, then why'd you keep this guy secret for so long?	2002-11-05

Yes, as a Christian, I find many offensive things within, but I also find honesty. This guy's a genius. He's insane. A heathen. A real thinker. A neo-moralist of my generation.<br />Palahniuk's words do have power.<br />\\"Lullaby\\" starts in a more linear fashion than his previous novels. We soon discover, along with his protagonist, Mr. Streator, that a children's poem is actually an old Zulu culling song, a means of killing people in a genteel manner (?!). Welcome to Palahniuk's wild and wacky world. I love it.<br />As Streator strikes out on a mission to end the curse, we meet his disenfranchised \\"family.\\" We see the insanity of the quiet-ophobics. We question whether there are worse things than killing someone--such as the slow death of our culture. Or the dancing hypnotism of Big Brother (identified with the media throughout the book).<br />The typical Palahniuk anarchist insanity doesn't ensue until about halfway through--about the time the witches and vegans join the crowd. That's not to say they are responsible. Not solely. No, in Palahniuk's writing, the usual suspects include the entire planet. He harpoons just about everyone. If this book doesn't offend you at some point, I'm certain Palahniuk would feel palpable disappointment.<br />But offending us isn't his sole goal. (Although some of my fellow believers might think so...we Christians have a tendency, paradoxically, to believe in blind faith while living with anemic imaginations.) His novels force us to think outside the box, to challenge our assumptions, to assume the challenges. Life is a mess. Chuck deals with that.

A thriller, a commentary on race and culture, a literary behemoth...\\"The Emperor of Ocean Park\\" sets out to be much more than a run-of-the-mill mystery.  Carter takes on a massive cast of characters and social issues and clearly communicates his points.  I applaud his courage to aim, without apology, at many of our country's sacred cows.  Whether or not I always agree with his targets, I admire his insights and powers of persuasion.<br />The book starts with the death of a revered judge.  It ends with his son trying to reconstruct the events leading to his father's demise.  Everything in between is in the form of a mystery: threatening notes, ransacked rooms, late-night attacks, graveyard shootings, and spies around every corner.  Played out on the chessboard of life, the novel succeeds on many levels.<br />My complaints are pedestrian, yet worth noting for those deciding to undertake a journey through a book of this length.  Carter's main character, while short on revealing emotion, is more than willing to pontificate on issues of our age.  This is enjoyable--until about half way through the book.  By this time, we're interested in the story and impatient with the diversions.  As the denouement nears, we realize that the plot is a well-crafted and labyrinthine thing, but it also cheats us to some extent.  Like an Agatha Christie story, \\"Emperor\\" withholds certain names and occupations, etc, until the precise moment when we, along with our hero, can say \\"Ah, now I see.\\"  This style, in my opinion, is unfair to the modern reader.  We want the chance to put the pieces together.  Yes, we're impressed at the tale-weaving, but give us a real chance to solve the puzzle along the way, or to realize at least that we missed that cleverly hidden clue.<br />I loved the book for the first 300 pages, liked it very much for the next 250, and liked it so-so in the last 100.  Overall, I recommend Carter's fantastic writing skills.  I'll jump to read his next book.  I hope, however, that he can marry his literary skills and story ideas with a mystery style more attainable to his contemporary readers.s.  I'll jump to read his next book.

Do I want to read for escape or read to be preached at in a roundabout manner?<br />Thankfully, Karen Hancock's writing turns a well-conceived allegory into a very entertaining tale.  Yes, she has some lessons about life tucked into the pages, but she rarely forgets that she's telling us a story.  And a good one, at that.  Her dialogue and characters are believable, and the landscape she paints vibrates with life and color...and danger.<br />\\"Arena\\" follows Callie as she enlists for an experiment to earn a couple extra bucks.  She thinks she'll be doing some sort of obstacle course.  She has unsettling notions that it's much more than that, but by the time she wants to turn back, it's too late.  She discovers herself thrust into a world similar to our own, but with disturbing differences.  Creatures stalk and attack; nasty mites invade and bite; mutants torture and kill.  The arena, she eventually realizes, is a test-tube of sorts of our own world, mirroring our spiritual and physical struggles.<br />The story moves quickly and comes to life especially when Callie and her companion Pierce are thrust together.  Both have weaknesses to wrestle, and both need each other to make it through the vast subworld.  Along the way, they face friendship, fear, love, and temptation.  Some reviewers have complained of graphic sex or violence, but they miss the spiritual reality of these depictions.  Hancock never shrinks from telling it like it is, allowing her characters and circumstances to rise above simple allegory into real-life truths.<br />My only complaints about the book rise from the points when allegory overpowers the story.  Midway through, Hancock throws in a few pages of misplaced history for her arena.  Her characters throughout the book do a masterful job of clarifying these ideas for us, and the interruption was just that: interrupting.  Although I appreciated her savior motifs, I felt they grew cumbersome at times as well.<br />Overall, \\"Arena\\" is an adventure and a love story, set in a world of sci-fi and fantasy.  To top it off, it spices the mix with spiritual concepts that are nicely handled and only occasionally heavy-handed.  This is a book well worth reading and an author definitely worth watching.s an adventure and a love story, set in a world of sci-fi and fantasy.

I've read all of Myers' adult fiction, and this book outshines his others in a number of ways.  The editing and writing are tighter than most of his previous efforts, and the subject of terrorism and religious extremists (both Christian and Muslim!) is particularly timely.<br />This is a novel of suspense.  The story follows retired Pastor Daniel Lawson and his questioning college-age son, Tyler, as they traverse the Middle East and Africa in search of religious artifacts.  One such artifact leads to Mrs. Lawson's death early on, providing strong motivation for her men to carry out their mission.  If, indeed, they can locate the remaining artifacts, they will have a complete high priest's breastplate from the era of Moses.  With it, they believe they will be able to hear God's voice in audible form.<br />The problem is, Islamic terrorists are on the brink of unleashing a worldwide plague, and they too want the breastplate to better understand Allah's plan for their attack.  Myers is careful to paint his Middle Easterners as real people with real motivations and sincere faith.  He contrasts many of their beliefs with the teachings of the Bible in thought-provoking ways.  This is one of the book's greatest achievements.<br />But it's a thriller, don't forget.  To help the terrorist efforts, their leader enlists two women who will follow the Lawson men on their quest.  Inevitably, the women develop feelings for Daniel and Tyler Lawson.  Betrayals and love, murder and kidnapping all come into the equation.  With occasional scenes of violence, and edge-of-your-seat suspense, Myers brings it all together in a satisfying and spiritually enlightening climax.<br />The only factor that kept me from giving this a 5 star rating is that I had a hard time believing the terrorists would revere a Jewish artifact as highly as the Lawson family.  Perhaps, the high priest's ephod holds great value in the Qu'ran, but this seeming glitch made it difficult for me to buy thoroughly into the premise.  Also, \\"The Face of God\\" is a fitting title, but the cover is rather generic and fails to specify even if this is fiction or not.<br />Nonetheless, I trust many will find this great novel and be challenged by Myers' call to Christians to return to our first love with God.

Although I'd never read an Athol Dickson novel before, the fantastic reviews and blurbs from other authors convinced me to give it a shot.  Boy am I thankful!  Otherwise I might've missed out on a great story.  The title, though appropiate enough, is ambiguous and rather bland for a mystery thriller.  The cover is equally so.<br />The writing, on the other hand, sparkles.  Dickson tells a fascinating tale that incorporates murder, mystery, love, fanatical obsession, Jewish and Christian dialogue, and the depths of relationships.  He opens with the release from prison of a man convicted of murder.  The two girls who witnessed him over the body, Ruth and Kate, are now grown-up and emotionally disconnected from each other.  Their religious differences and the pain of their past have pushed them apart.  Ruth, single after the sudden death of her fiance, is a reform Rabbi.  Kate, a widow with two kids, is an antique store owner.  Neither of them are aware of the threats that have been unleashed with the prisoner's release, but the violence and suspense that soon surround them force them together in a fight for survival.<br />Dickson masterfully portrays his characters.  His villians are wrought with real pain and motivations; his protagonists are fallible, likeable, and sometimes unpredictable.  The dialogue rings true throughout.  His setting of New Orleans, while never as palpable as in a James Lee Burke mystery, is believable.  The only flaw, if it can be deemed so, is the multiple viewpoints that might be distracting to some.  Though each character's thoughts are viable, not all of the minor ones are necessary to the overall story.  I still enjoyed them for the added nuances they gave.<br />Without revealing the plot twists and surprises, I'll leave it to others to discover the lingering and powerful effects of this novel.  Meet Ruth, Kate, Sol, Gabby, Jake, and Orvis--characters you won't soon forget.  Don't let the title and cover fool you...it'll have you tightly in its grip until the final pages.in its grip until the final pages.	2002-09-26

The story sounded promising, bolstered by its reviews and the claim to international bestsellerdom.  Only upon closer perusal did I discover the book was a bilingual edition (the publishers make little effort to communicate this to potential buyers...shame on them).  In addition, the 80 pages that comprise the story are the equivalent to 40-50 pages in an average novel.  Bottom line: Over 12 bucks for a short story?  This better be good, right?<br />It is good.  In the 45 minutes it took to read, I discovered charming and thoughtful life lessons about forgiveness and acceptance.  \\"In Our Strange Gardens\\" makes every attempt to fill its short space with character and setting and pace.  Without retelling the plot--which would be akin to telling the story, minus one or two surprises--let me say simply that Quint examines war and the peoples' lives who survive it through the eyes of a child.<br />What the boook fails to do is justify its price and attention.  I know I'm the odd man out here, based on other reviewers' raves, but I didn't find this tale to be rapturous.  In fact, if you enjoy a good short story, try Frederick Forsyth's \\"No Comebacks\\" and \\"The Veteran,\\" Dick Francis' \\"Field of Thirteen,\\" or Jeffrey Archer's \\"To Cut a Long Story Short\\" and \\"Twelve Red Herrings.\\"  Those three veteran writers (popular fictionalists, yes--but great storytellers!) produce some gems, surprising, quirky, and heartwarming.  For more literary short stories, read Ursula Hegi's \\"Hotel of the Saints,\\" or even Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"Collected Short Stories.\\"  The ability to communicate huge ideas in short spaces is nothing new, and Quint's tale, though admirably composed, failed to live up to my expectations.	2002-09-26
1405924:US	50287514	R3FC54D9XIQ346	0375413596	709795035	The White	Books	4	19	22	N	N	A "Simple" Tale	\\"The White\\" is sparse, yet rich with imagery and color.  The story opens with a young girl's plight as her family is captured and destroyed by Indians in the mid 1700's.  She alone lives to share the tale.  Mary's story, based on fact, is told with a simple style befitting her mindset.  She is emotionally dead and even language, in the aftermath of her sorrow, is a useless appendage to her.<br />As the story moves along, we see Mary open slowly to the warmth of her adopted Seneca family.  Particularly, the sincere and sensitive advances of her future Indian husband crack her shell of grief.  At times, Larsen's words have haunting power.  At other times, they simply fill the book in its headlong rush to a conclusion.  So much is skipped over that it was hard not to feel cheated.  Unlike other reviewers, I appreciated the first-person accounts, almost wishing Larsen had pursued this approach throughout.  If Larsen truly wanted to fictionalize and expand upon this true story, why not do it with depth?  Why, for example, should we feel any true sorrow over the deaths of Mary's sons when we see so little of the relationship between them all?<br />The aspects of Seneca life and thought are tantalizingly interspersed through the story, and the dark images of injustice done to and by the Indians give this novella historical worth.  As a story, it is interesting, as well as briefly and intermittently moving.  Although fully worth the brief amount of time required to read, \\"The White\\" left me wondering why I wasn't given more to chew on.  As small reward, Larsen does end with Mary's first childhood memory, one that not only carries symbolic and emotional meaning, but also calls into question our very understanding of the book's simple title.<br />Perhaps, on a second reading, this book is not so simple after all.	2002-09-17

Is this a worthwhile read?  A good story?  A diverting three hours of reading time?<br />Simply stated, the answer is yes.  \\"The Bondwoman's Narrative\\" isn't the most complex story.  The ideas are not all that original, and do, in fact, come close to overplaying their gothic and romanticized hands.  But the attention to detail, the believable characters, and the view into the mindset of a slave set hooks quickly and draw you along.  The language, although flawed at times (thank you, Mr. Gates, for allowing us to see the manuscript as you saw it), is effective and occasionally beautiful.  The story of young Hannah Crafts and her slow escape from servanthood to freedom in New Jersey is worth studying.  It underlines the psychological effects that slavery inflicted, effects that still resonate into this present age.  Despite the unflinching narrative, Crafts is fairly objective in her judgment of whites and blacks, finding good and evil on both sides of the line...thereby making the lines invisible.  \\"The Bondwoman's Narrative,\\" for these reasons and more, could become a valuable addition to a school's curriculum.  For me, it was a valuable personal exposure to wounds of our country's past.<br />In footnote, yes, I found that Gates and his associates used accurate and detailed research to establish the authenticity of this manuscript.  The notes and printed results are nearly as fascinating as the story itself.  The investment by those involved is to be commended; they have done the literary and historical worlds a great service by their labor of love.	2002-09-17

Although it never reaches the heights of the brilliant \\"The Lord of the Flies,\\" it does paint vivid and fragmented pictures of man come undone.<br />William Golding, after seeing the horrors of war firsthand, rejected the foundational thought of humanism that \\"man is basically good.\\"  In \\"The Lord of the Flies,\\" he used concise language and haunting symbolism to validate his thoughts.  And, by creating sympathetic characters, he drew us into his viewpoint.  Few of his other novels create such sympathy.  It is as though he bought into his own philosophy so deeply that he no longer found value in his fellow man.  \\"Pincher Martin\\" and \\"Free Fall\\" left me impressed with his skills, but intellectually unmoved.<br />In \\"The Spire,\\" he moves me again.  At first, his protagonist--an anti-hero in every sense--is hard to sympathize with in any fashion.  The man, Dean Jocelin, is driven to the point of obsession and insanity by his need to serve God, or, ultimately his need to feel worthy in God's sight.  He demands obedience and servitude from those around him, driving them to complete his vision of a 400 ft spire above his cathedral.  In the process, some will die, others will lose faith, hope, and love.  Only as Jocelin comes to terms with his fallibility do we begin to care about the doomed outcome of his dream.  Only as he admits his own pride and stubborness do we hope for his absolution, deserved or not.<br />This book is an ode to all those who become obsessed by religion and love, who strive for something to the point of sacrificing everything of true value along the way.  Here, finally, Golding once again finds a way to show the madness of humanity while still proferring a glimmer of hope.	2002-09-17

Like \\"Watership Down\\" or \\"The Plague Dogs,\\" Clement-Davies' first novel told a captivating story that managed to communicate deeper lessons about life and humanity.  His omnipotent view makes his writing disjointed at times, makes it more difficult to sympathize with the main characters, yet I couldn't ignore the power of his narrative.  With enthusiasm, I went to the local library and requested that they purchase \\"The Sight\\" for their catalogue...which they did!<br />Unfortunately, this book was a big disappointment.  Here, instead of telling a story with a message worked in, Clement-Davies tells a message with a story worked in--an ill-advised idea in fiction.  Subtle storytelling is much more powerful.  Richard Adams' books succeed due to the strength of the characters and plot.  So did \\"Fire-Bringer.\\"<br />In \\"The Sight,\\" I felt deceived.  Here I was again, following the troubled youth of a destined child--this time a wolf instead of a deer.  Again, I was dreading a villain animal that'd been corrupted by exposure to those dreadful humans.  Maybe though, just maybe, the book would lead down a different path.  Maybe I'd find something new.<br />Wrong!  After a promising first half of the book, I saw the characters and plot begin to waver.  The focus was lost.  As the end drew near, I plodded forward, already sure of the 'surprises' and afraid that the preaching would begin...which it did, with gusto.  A pulpit built out of stacked books would not have made it any more obvious.  \\"The Sight\\" forgets that humans, too, can see truth.  Instead, it bangs us over the head with the visions of the wolves.  It becomes a transparent skeleton of plot ideas--most of which the author used in the first book--and an overwrought treatise on the demise of mankind.  To make everyone happy, Clement-Davies throws in mythology, Christianity, New Age mumbo-jumbo, and a disappointing sprinkle of true history, perhaps thinking he would appeal to a wider audience.  I, for one, would've rather read a great story with ideas different than my own, than read a lukewarm story that pandered to my sympathies.<br />In the end, the book's desire to teach lessons made me resent the time wasted.  I was even willing to overlook such literary miscues as the redundant usage of \\"But\\" to start sentences (more than eight on a page on more than one occasion!), but by the end, my patience had run dry.  Clement-Davies' has the ability to make a story come alive, I still believe that.

After reading the Publishers Weekly review I was uncertain about diving into a book of over 600 pages.  Nevertheless, the sharp-looking cover and intriguing liner notes sucked me into the story...and, boy, am I glad!<br />Despite a few minor speed bumps, \\"Mission Compromised\\" is a fast-paced military thriller.  We follow the mission of a Marine, Peter Newman, as he coordinates secretive, UN-appointed teams for quick response in global hotspots.  He is particularly motivated to see one team become successful in its assignment to assassinate Aidid, the man responsible for the Mogadishu disaster as documented in \\"Black Hawk Down.\\"  Newman's brother was a victim of the massacre, and Newman wants revenge.  He also wants to repair his failing marriage, but has few tools to do so.  As the story progresses, other factors--Russian, Iraqi, and American--come into focus and threaten Newman's teams, not to mention his very existence.<br />\\"Mission Compromised\\" is a solid thriller.  The scope of the characters and plot never equals the scope of a Tom Clancy novel, but the global ramifications of the story do.  To call the plot 'convoluted' is to claim amateur status as a reader of espionage novels.  With Joe Musser's co-writing, North communicates clearly and effectively, though never oversimplifying the entanglements of any government operation.  North's intimate knowledge of his subject matter adds to the breathlessness of the book, particularly in the last third.  Sure, the ponderous military parlance might seem overwhelming, but it also underlines the veracity of the story as a whole.<br />As for speed bumps?  Sections of the story do become evangelistic, but they are tame and far from overwhelming.  Characters are believable, but never deeply studied.  In fact, the book reads most often with the dispassionate delivery of a nonfiction account; when it does dip into emotionalism, it does so subtly--and managed to catch me off-guard on two separate occasions.<br />My main question upon completing the last page:  Where does fiction end and reality begin?  Scary stuff.  Maybe I'd be safer not knowing.tion upon completing the last page:  Where does fiction end and reality begin?  Scary stuff.  Maybe I'd be safer not knowing.	2002-09-10

His dialogue crackles with realism and intensity; his characters breathe down your back, they're so alive; and the emotions he conveys are rich without being melodramatic.  Atticus Kodiak, his protaganist, moves in a circle of foul-mouthed, partying friends, yet maintains a style all his own in the midst of the muck about him.<br />Here, again, Atticus Kodiak is at work as a bodyguard, this time watching over the daughter of his former lover.  Erika's all grown up now--or thinks she is--and isn't always hip to the idea of his guardianship.  What's truly eating young Erika, though, is the power struggle between her despicable parents.  She takes out her frustrations on those sent to protect her, but finds a friend in Kodiak's off-and-on romantic interest, Bridgett.  With trained assassins opposing Kodiak's team, the odds seem stacked against him, but he manages to come through...not without some physical and emotional scars along the way.<br />If you're a fan of G-rated mysteries (in the Mrs. Pollifax vein), steer clear of Kodiak.  If you like your mysteries tough and gritty, with a bit of heart (think Dashiell Hammett after the sexual revolution), then give this series a shot.	2002-09-07

Hmm, was this worth my time?<br />Although I believe in the sanctity of life, the subject matter of this book almost kept me from reading it.  I feared a thinly veiled anti-abortion discourse--and one thing I don't handle well is agenda-heavy fiction.  If you want to make a point, make sure to entertain and tell a good story at the same time.  That's why Grisham's legal thrillers continue to sell even while taking on the tobacco industry, the homeless crisis, etc.<br />Cutrer and Glahn dispelled my fears quickly.  The medical details, the unflinching looks at difficult subjects, and the likeable characters drew me in.  ...<br />Although \\"False Positive\\" doesn't have the immediate hook of a Grisham-type thriller, it does have the very human motivations, readable dialogue, and ethical dilemmas that Grisham has used to such marvelous effect.  The authors handle this medical mystery with maturity, surprises, and grace.  As the story draws a growing number of characters together, the action accelerates and the emotional impact rises.  While never veering from their spiritual beliefs, the authors (and publisher) demonstrate open minds and open hearts.  Beware: stanch advocates of either side of the abortion debate will cry foul, but this book rises above the mudslinging.  Cutrer and Glahn raise questions not easily answered by either side.  They write about real people who don't always agree.  And I liked that.<br />In fact, I liked this book.  A lot!  Although \\"False Positive\\" was my first read by these authors, it will not be my last.	2002-08-31

It's a slower-paced historical whodunit, an unraveling of time and place, a trek through facts and figures to discover life and meaning.<br />Short on dialogue, heavy on historical sketches and vignettes, this is not a fast-paced read.  However, it is a fascinating story, full of rewards for the patient ones.  Long asks that you set aside other distractions and focus on the story of Eve Lawson as she tries to save the threatened property of Quinlin's Estate.  Set in Lowerton, Pennsylvania, the novel follows Eve and her handful of helpers as they tackle this seemingly impossible task.  We see the pieces of the town's and estate's history fall piece by piece into Long's protracted puzzle.  Like a puzzle with no apparent focus, this book might be difficult for those with short attention spans--fair warning!--but, as Long deftly places the darker pieces of his characters' lives into place, the intrigue builds undeniably.  Halfway through, I was hooked, no question.<br />The final third of the book is full of rewards.  Long brings the story to a satisfactory ending that is short on romanticism and heavy on metaphor and mystery.  The transformation of Eve Lawson is masterfully portrayed.  \\"Quinlin's Estate,\\" like Long's first novel, is rich in spiritual depth without preaching.  Long lets us see through Lawson's eyes the power of finding a purpose and a place to fit in.  Through the enduring picture of the tower at Quinlin's Estate, we find that there's no such thing as a lost cause.	2002-08-27

We discover a young boy named Alazrian, grandchild of Tassis Gayle--a boy with remarkable gifts.  We encounter zealous priests and clan leaders.  Lastly, we reunite with a lethargic Richius Vantran.  The ultimate reluctant anti-hero, Richius plays a lesser role here, allowing Alazrian, Biago, and sea-lord Kasrin to become larger than life figures.<br />One of John Marco's weaknesses is also a strength.  At times, while reading this novel, I felt I was reading historical fiction rather than fantasy.  The series, as a whole, rides on thin wings of magic and fantastical creatures.  Primarily, it comes across as a view into a forgotten segment of human history.<br />And, paradoxically, that is what makes it so impressive.<br />Marco manages to breathe life and depth into his characters and settings.  They seem so real that it's hard to believe they haven't existed at some point in time.  In fact, his characters are driven by very real emotions and desires.  They change.  They elevate.  Degrade.  Fall in love.  Hate.  Some fester with insanity while others wear insecurity for all to see.<br />I particularly enjoyed the sea battles and Lissen environs.  I'd love to see Marco do a series based on oceanic struggles.  This book has some memorable moments, though not as many as his previous two.  He handles the magical elements credibly and shows he can move further that direction.  While bringing things to a satisfactory close, he also leaves plenty of room for a continuation of the series.<br />Which wouldn't be a bad thing.  This is one of the better series around.	2002-08-21

Long's style is clipped and fast-paced; his characters are plot-driven, but full of real motivations; and the premise was throat-grabbing.  Unfortunately, I kept waiting for the payoff that never seemed to come.  By building layer upon layer to increase the tension--which he did admirably--Long was left holding too many loose ends to tie off realistically at the end.<br />But the story's worth telling.<br />When a collection of bones and \\"year zero\\" artifacts leads to the unleashing of an unprecedented plague, Nathan Lee is a man caught on the crest of the destruction.  His arduous road back to civilization lands him with a group of the world's top scientists as they race to find a cure before total extinction occurs.  Part of their plan is to clone \\"year zero\\" humans who might have built immunities to the same virus.  In so doing, they raise ethical, moral, and spiritual questions.  They also discover a man who claims to be Jesus Christ--cloned from DNA on a wood splinter.  (This tantalizing idea, like a number of other subplots, is more an afterthought than fleshed-out idea.)<br />Nathan Lee, a likeable and sympathetic character, is driven to find his young daughter.  Along the way, he deals with Ochs, his old nemesis, Miranda, a potential flame, and Eesho, the man claiming to be Jesus Christ.  Through Nathan Lee's eyes, in particular, we glimpse the frightening fallout of a world on the brink of destruction.  The details, small and large, are credible and thought-provoking.  Long makes it all seem somehow possible.  For that reason alone, this novel's worth reading.  It strips away the superficial aspects of culture and questions where our loyalties and beliefs truly lie.  Unfortunately, the cloning and Christ-clone ideas proved to be only fluff in the book's overall resolution.  (Try James Beauseignur's \\"Christ Clone Trilogy\\" to see that idea explored with great zeal!)<br />Although enjoyable, for me \\"Year Zero\\" was like a Chinese buffet: it looked so good, went down so easy, yet left me hungry for more soon after closing the last page.ea explored with great zeal!)<br />Although enjoyable, for me \\"Year Zero\\" was like a Chinese buffet: it looked so good, went down so easy, yet left me hungry for more soon after closing the last page.	2002-08-15

And Arthur Phillips is far too stylistic an author to pontificate--although he comes close at times.<br />\\"Prague\\" is a book full of Gen-X angst, yet it maintains a vision of hope and a future--even if that hope is misplaced.  Despite the dark moods, the writer's words crackle with wit and humor.  The irony of the title is not lost on us readers, though, apparently, the book's characters never do quite realize the transience of their dreams.<br />Phillips' debut novel follows a group of young Westerners afloat in the sea of Hungary's early 90s ambiguity.  I, myself, was in both cities during that time period and believe he admirably captures the raised expectations and shortsighted youthfulness of my generation.  Does he capture the pulse and ambience of Budapest itself?  No.  Even having lived there shortly, I was hardpressed to conjure memories of that wonderful city from Phillips' narrative.  He cheats us of the magnificent views from the castled ramparts, of the out-of-this-world concoctions in authentic subterranean restaurants, of the brooding violence and discontent of the young nationals.  But, in all fairness, the physical setting is not Phillips' tableau.  He chooses, rather, to delve deep into the psyche of his characters, particularly that of John Price, a budding journalist and bastion of virgin ideals.  Through John's eyes, we see hopes chased, stolen, dashed, and recreated.  Through John's abandonment of his own ideals, we see a generation that flounders on a sea of neo-modern (ie. tediously ancient) amoralism and thinks they'll yet find goodness in a world of gray.<br />Throughout the book, I was reminded of the caustic and biting works of Chuck Palahniuk (Fight Club, Choke).  Where Palahniuk decides to chuck the culture, Phillips chooses to buck the system while still believing in reform.  Where Palahniuk dives into savage and sexual mayhem as a form of shock therapy, Phillips splashes in the same waters with some restraint, with fingers clutching for possible survivors.  Although I couldn't always admire or even like his characters, I could understand them.  Relate to them.  Alternately, hate and fall in love with them.  I could fully believe their parts in the larger whole.  True, the story dragged at times, begging for greater doses of Phillips' well-nuanced dialogue, but it refused to let go.  Some questions never do receive answers...was Kriztina one of Imre's illegitimate daughter's? for example--we are simply left to wonder...but this is not a story about answers.  Or is it?<br />Phillips is a truly gifted writer.  \\"Prague\\" is a book full of ideas and melancholy and dysfunction.  For me, the hopeful ending was the saddest bit of all.  To close the pages was to turn my back on friends needing direction.<br />If you're looking for easy solutions, go elsewhere; if you're looking for anarchist chaos mixed with brilliant satire, go to Palahniuk...but if you're looking for something in between, join with Phillips and go to \\"Prague.\\"with some restraint, with fingers clutching for possible survivors.

What not to say?<br />Shane Johnson's newest novel is part sci-fi, part fantasy, part horror, and totally cool.  It has moving moments, scenes of wonder and grace, descriptions of violence and otherworldly doings.  From its seemingly innocuous beginnings to its startling center, \\"Ice\\" brings imagination up a level.  Like Randall Ingermanson's \\"Oxygen,\\" this novel attempts to be much more than run-of-the-mill sci-fi...and yet, my fascination with \\"Ice\\" cooled by the end.<br />The book follows two astronauts in particular, men stranded on the moon after a failed ascent back into the moon's orbit.  With mere hours of oxygen to spare, they decide to die doing what they've always dreamed of: exploring the ice fields on the dark side of the moon.  (Trust me, with Johnson's expertise and knowledge in this are, he makes this seem entirely believable; without overwhelming us, he brings NASA speak down to the average reader's level.  Very well done.)  As the astronauts began their exploration, I was unsure of what to expect.  I was hooked.  And the anticipation paid off.  Can't tell you much more than that without ruining some of the fun, but you'll want to read it to see what I'm talking about.<br />My only disappointment was that the ensuing circumstances don't lead to any true conflict--other than the immediate issues of survival.  And the final explanations, though intriguing, left me only wanting more.  Johnson opens a theological and historical wormhole that deserves a lot more exploration.  Based on the first 340 pages, I believe he's fully capable of leading that exploration.  Based on the letdown of the last 50 pages, I can only hope he has plans for a sequel.<br />This is one cool book, well worth reading, but I hope the next one heats it up.	2002-07-27

Lewis' \\"Perelandra,\\" add another part \\"This Present Darkness,\\" and soak it in a batter of DC comic books...you'll have Beale's \\"The War in Heaven.\\"  This book tries to do so much, yet it maintains a simplicity that can be both attractive and aggravating.<br />Beale takes us into a celestial battle between demons and angels, showing us the struggle through the eyes of three teens.  One of them, Christopher, is drawn away by the Fallen angels and sides quickly with them, discovering power and success that eluded him as a mere mortal.  His transformation is believable.  His later conflict to choose good over evil is less fleshed out.  The realms of battle, the weapons, and strategies were imaginative and interesting.  The entire feel of the novel is one of a hip video game (which I believe is/was in existence, designed by Beale himself).  Although this aspect of the story adds color and melodrama, it also undermines the characters and true drama.  I was fascinated.  Yet I was never truly worried, for example, about the livelihood of any particular character.<br />For a book that'll rock your concepts of heaven and hell, for a fast-paced and imaginative read, this book will satisfy you.  Take it for what it's worth and be challenged.  I was.  I'm looking forward to what unfolds in the sequel \\"A World in Shadow.\\"	2002-07-23

Particularly \\"The Time Quartet.\\"  Each book, while exploring time and space and spiritual battles between good and evil, has also been creative throughout.  Yes, \\"Many Waters\\" starts off with a fresh idea and setting.  I loved getting to know Meg's brothers, the twins.  I enjoyed the descriptions of the seraphim and nephilim, and the clear connections to angels and fallen angels.  I also thought L'Engle handled the adolescent struggles of the boys in a mature way.<br />The problem for me was that the story became tedious.  The conflict was minimal, compared to previous books, and the main thing I looked forward to was the coming of the many waters, the description of the great flood as told of in biblical accounts.<br />But it never came.  L'Engle wimped out on her one trump card.  She refused to play the card and truly open a past world to us.  In this, I was sorely disappointed.  She has the ability and the imagination to do amazing things.  Yet, here she left me high and dry.  I recommend the book as a part of the series, but alone it is far from my favorite.	2002-07-18

I've read enough tired and trite books aimed at men, books that attempt to encapsulate a theology that'll empower men to follow God.  What they are missing, and what this book catches, is the true heart of a man and how it coincides with God's design for us.  Along the way, Eldredge gives us insights into the motivations of the Christian woman and wife as well.  I found myself laughing out loud, then coming close to tears at the vital truths exposed here.  I read aloud portions to my wife.  We discussed issues, and I was able to share frustrations I've had for years.  With church.  With our society.  With the Christian view of the Really Nice Guy...who also happens to have no backbone, spiritually or socially, to deal with issues.  Thank you, Mr Eldredge, for writing such a powerful and honest book.  Thank you for giving us a ticket to freedom as Christian men.	2002-07-18

Sorry.  Not the same thing.  These characters are alive and fresh and memorable.  The settings resonate with sights and sounds and smells.  The beauty of Louisiana juxtapositioned with the evil of the criminal world is a heady mix.  As always, I'm impressed by Burke's ability.  I feel like I'm repeating myself: James Lee Burke is a master of imagery, be it violent and dark, or moving and poetic.  I can't help myself.  To read his work is to fall in love with the language.  With this in mind, it's true that I tend to overlook his meandering plots and psychological side-trips.  For me, they make his books much more real and down to earth than the general formulaic mysteries.<br />In this particular story, we see Dave Robicheaux dealing with his inner demons, as always--this time in the form of pills.  But it's the same white worm eating at him and driving anger to the surface.  As usual, his emotions boil over into his job and cause trouble.  The difference this time is that Robicheaux is dealing with other demons than his own.  He's dealing with Legion, an old man, hard as nails and full of darkness.  The supernatural aspects that come into play, particularly at the conclusion were, for me, very satisfying and remarkably well handled.  Other reviewers have derided these elements; I found them to be the original touch this series needed.  Others complained of sexual situations that were unnecessary; I was moved to tears by Bootsie's tenderness to her man in need of assurance.  Robicheaux, behind his tough exterior, is a man of flesh and blood and emotion.  Thankfully, James Lee Burke is too.  It's the reason I keep reading his stuff.  After \\"Purple Cane Road,\\" I'd rate this near the top of the series.	2002-07-11

Not Entirely...Factual?  Absolutely!	The idea of paralleling Lewis' and Freud's thoughts and writings is intriguing, to say the least.  I've long been a fan of C.S. Lewis' fiction, as well as his cerebral takes on the Christian message.  I'm not as familiar with Freud, but his basic ideas and verbage are so much a part of our culture that his influence cannot be denied.  (In fact, I did get to visit his home and office in Vienna.  A visit well worth taking, if you ever have the chance.)<br />Nicholi's knowledge of his subjects is considerable.  He puts forth the arguments of both men in a readable and concise manner, never failing to deepen our own knowledge.  His writing is bright and well conceived.  If, however, you expect pure objectivism here (is such a thing possible?), you might be disappointed.  Nicholi's own views come to the front, although he makes a game attempt to keep all material within the writings of his two debaters.  Personally, I agree with Nicholi's convictions and, in this age of political correctness, admired his courage to make them apparent.  He highlights good and bad in both men's lives, and contradictions in their own beliefs.  Yes, he seems to lean toward Lewis' views on God and faith, but he never does so by berating or undermining Freud's teachings.  If you, like myself, are looking for deeper understanding of either man's thoughts, you will find it here.  Just be warned that Nicholi, after his many years of studying and teaching this subject, has come to his own convictions and makes them clear.  I suppose we, even by reading this book, seek to strengthen or challenge or own convictions as well.<br />I found the sections on love and sex particularly insightful, with deep insights from both Freud and Lewis.  It's actually amazing how often their ideas overlap, with the difference being their belief in a moral or materialistic universe.  I was prone to underline entire paragraphs at a time.<br />Lewis vs. Freud.  This is the match of the century.  The tantalizing thought that these two giants may well have met before Freud's death is material for a worthy novelist.  Meanwhile, we are left with Nicholi's non-fiction work...and it's a work worthy of its cover price.hat these two giants may well have met before Freud's death is material for a worthy novelist.

The figure was pretentious, intriguing, and alluring in some romantic fashion.  Michael Frayn's \\"Spies\\" is much the same.<br />Frayn's narrator is Stephen Wheatley, a boy living in England during WWII.  He and his friend Keith begin keeping tabs on Keith's mother, believing she is a German spy.  What starts out as an innocent game leads to discoveries about life, love, and betrayal.  The tragedies of war are funneled through this story into the damaging affects of family secrets.  Stephen and Keith, our young spies, will never be the same.  With finesse, Frayn leads us through the foggy tunnels of a British neighborhood and the foggier tunnels of his narrator's mind.  Stephen is a complex and well-drawn creation.  Symbolism plays a pleasing and unifying part.<br />\\"Spies\\" does so many things efficiently that it's easy to overlook its faults.  Perhaps my greatest hindrance in plodding through the first 150 pages was the conspicious brevity of dialogue.  Too bad.  When the characters spoke, I found myself actually involved in their story.  We spend so much time in Stephen's head that I found it hard to know or care deeply for any of the periphery characters.  Stephen is so self-absorbed with his own insecurities and logic that he gives us little time to know others around him.  Sure, that may be his personality, but I found it distracting.  Who, reading this book, wouldn't like to know more about Keith or Barbara or Keith's mother or...?  Well, I don't want to give anything away.<br />Having scanned reviews before reading the book, I expected to dislike the ending much more than I did.  Actually, I felt the slow unveiling of the truth was well-paced and surprising without being forced.  The final chapter was, indeed, a flightly sketch of Stephen's entire life.  Although I wanted to know more, by that time I was so tired of being in his head that I was simply ready to turn the final page.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the elements of story, plot, and setting.  If you're ready for a jump back into childhood days of imagination, then take the time to know young Stephen Wheatley.  You'll be spending a lot of time with him.e final page.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the elements of story, plot, and setting.

Any aspiring Christian writers will find encouragement &quot;Behind the Stories&quot; of these authors.<br />The good: I appreciated the variety and sheer number of Christian authors represented in this volume.  Each had a tale of struggle and triumph on the road to publication.  I found worthy lessons in each chapter.  Randy Alcorn's financial sacrifices, Dee Henderson's steady planning, Bodie Thoene's physical limitations...all of these, and more, were uplifiting and challenging to any would-be authors such as myself.<br />The bad: The editor decided to underline the evident lessons with spiritual platitudes and trite endings.  The stories--as should be, from any fiction writers--spoke for themselves.  Unfortunately, the mini-sermons wore on my patience.  In addition, I got the feeling at a number of points that the authors' true struggles had been tidied up a bit for the Christian audience.<br />Thankfully, the authors who do attempt full disclosure manage to breathe fresh air into this book, even if we can't fully appreciate it.  Still, any fresh air is worth it in the lonely world of a writer.	2002-06-18

I related to the same sense of awe and dread, of wonder and inspiration.  Surely, Tolkien has inspired many.<br />Unfortunately, the praise gets to be redundant and--may I say it?--almost hollow, without the balance of some thoughtful criticism.  Personally, I wouldn't have much negative to say regarding Tolkien's work, but I found very little that was genuinely fresh or enlightening in this collection of &quot;meditations.&quot;  I did discover an interest in some of the authors included (not a bad reason for their involvement in the project) and in earlier 20th century writers that I have never familiarized myself with.  Lord Dunsany, E.R. Eddison, Fritz Leiber, and Mervyn Peake are only a few of the old standbys mentioned repeatedly.<br />Although interesting, a quick read, and well-written, this collection might best serve those curious in unearthing the inspiration beneath some of their favorite authors.

Book such as this and Leon Uris' &quot;Topaz&quot; surely set the stage for the modern legal thrillers we're all familiar with.  Here, while probing matters of the law and of morals, West draws characters full of pathos and love and honor.  This book never builds to the excitement of &quot;The Tower of Babel&quot; or &quot;Salamander,&quot; nor to the spiritual intrigue of &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; or &quot;The Clowns of God,&quot; but it poignantly captures the drama and schisms in a Tuscan family.<br />The story opens with a beautiful young lady's arrival in a small Italian town.  She promptly goes to the door of the mayor and shoots him in cold blood.  From there, her guilt and her defense serve as the fulcrum upon which the major characters balance.  The defense attorney and his wife have their own private battles to deal with.  The psychiatrist called upon by the defense is in a struggle for his own sense of purpose and for love with a mature young woman.  And, overshadowing them all, the attorney's father-in-law wields control in his own twisted quest for connection.  The ceaseless dysfunction plays its final hand in the closing pages.<br />Sure, West's characters tend to be verbose and wise beyond credibility, yet they are painted against such vivid backgrounds and given such concrete motivations that I can't help but lose myself in their stories.  West, as always, has probing questions--and occasional answers--regarding ethics and spirituality in a modern age.  Though I might not always agree with his suppositions, I always admire the courage and imagination he draws upon to highlight our troubled times.<br />I will sorely miss the fiction offerings of Morris L. West.	2002-06-08

Le Carre follows his title with strict adherence, refusing to let his characters--or even his readers--understand the goal of this &quot;game.&quot;<br />What purports to be an espionage thriller is much more a whodunit set against the drab backdrop of post-Cold War England and the haunted memories of one of Her Majesty's secret servants, Tim Cranmer.  Cranmer's girlfriend and top agent have disappeared and the authorities are demanding answers from him.  Even Cranmer begins to doubt his innocence--although this interesting sidestep was quickly righted.  As is to be expected, le Carre develops Cranmer's personality with depth and sincerity, but this numbing dive into the depths of one man's self-absorption left me gasping for air.  Even compared to the typically dreary atmosphere of le Carre's other books, this novel seems dark and pointless.  Aside from his protagonist, he never truly allows us to become familiar with the other people involved.  Through the use of first person, le Carre cheats us from experiencing much of the story.  If this was intentional, to set us up for future surprises, for example, I would understand.  Instead, I knew the basic ending long before our hero seemed to, and I found myself waiting impatiently for him to catch up.  I held out hope for a worthwhile revelation...but it never came.<br />I'm a dedicated le Carre fan, but this novel was much simpler and less satisfying than I've come to expect from him.  Even his shorter works had more actually story to them.  Le Carre will always be the master of the Cold War angst and zeitgeist, but this expose of a tired former agent left me mostly tired.  For better post-Cold War works, try the same author's &quot;The Night Manager&quot; or &quot;The Constant Gardner.&quot;	2002-06-04

Moore shines when writing of tough men living off a tough land.  Here, by thrusting his ideas into an apocalyptic future, Moore once again tells of rugged people coming to grips with God's place in the hardships of life.<br />His main character, Daniel, is an AWOL lieutenant on the run through the wastelands of an America devasted by plague.  Chased by Robert, another Army-trained assassin, Daniel comes upon groups of religious zealots, cannibals, and babbling fools.  With little emotion, Daniel faces these challenges.  The real test comes when a beautiful woman named Deborah enters the picture.  Soon Daniel is serving as Deborah's guide, unaware that she will become much more the guide than he.  Along the way, they will face love, death, horror, and redemption.<br />Moore's writing, as always, is lean and sparkling, with sentences full of wisdom and spiritual themes.  His dialogue between Daniel and Deborah brings the story to dazzling life.  The repartee is dry and witty and full of character.  Although I appreciated some of the allegorical elements further along, I felt they were a distraction from the totally absorbing relationship between the two main characters.  As the allegorical section faded, once again Daniel and Deborah are thrust together (although in very different roles) and surprises are revealed that lead to a life and death confrontation.  Moore foreshadows his major surprise quite well (so well, I guess, that I had it figured out half way through the book), but the message is still effective and I highly recommend the book.	2002-06-01

What starts out as a basic trip to Mars (could that really be basic?) turns into a nightmare of suspicion, sabotage, and stretches of faith.  Through witty and believable dialogue, with detailed research and thorough but never cumbersome facts, the authors sweep us along into a captivating scenario.  Along the way, we come to know Bob and Valkerie and the others that surround their work and relationship.  The web of suspicion draws tighter and tighter until the last fifty pages when even further surprises are revealed.  What seems to be a fairly straightforward survival-in-space story contains much more.  I read the last paragraph with a smile, a short laugh, and my heart in my throat.  This is smooth and effortless storytelling.  Well worth it.	2002-05-28

L'Engle explores many time-travel ideas in this 70's novel, showing that she owns at least part of that market.  Throughout \\"A Swiftly Tilting Planet,\\" we see how the actions of even one person can have effect on the future.  The \\"back to the future\\" idea is well paced and thought out.  The implications of one's actions become painfully--and gloriously--clear.<br />In this case, a madman has threatened to set off a nuclear weapon.  The Murray family once again gets entangled in fantastic adventure as Charles Wallace and Meg unite to offset the coming evil.  Charles, with the support of his older sister and the help of a unicorn, travels to different time periods to avert disaster.  Along the way, he must deal with the demonic Echthroi, crazed leaders, and jealous family members.  The book picks up speed towards its satisfying climax.  I particularly enjoyed the unicorn nesting ground.  L'Engle's imagination is in full flight here.<br />To be honest though, I had a difficult time getting started on this story, primarily because of Meg's sudden jump in age and her less prominent role in the story.  Overall, though, I was fascinated by the fight for survival and the powerful spiritual messages.  Some have scorned L'Engle's broad-minded metaphysical ideas; I personally think she explores other realms in a way that always makes it clear humans are subordinate to their maker.  Kudos to her creative abilities.  I can't wait for the last book in The Time Quartet.	2002-05-23

Bill Bryson invites us to join him &quot;In a Sunburned Country.&quot;  He takes us into the Australian outback, to the Boomerang Coast, to the famed Uluru (Ayers Rock), and never misses a chance to tickle our funny bones or fill our heads with wonderfully useless facts about Australian history, politics, geography, etc.  Along the way he meets eccentric characters and fiesty animals and awe-inspiring sights.  This book, although funny (hilarious in spots), never matches the outloud laugh factor of &quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself.&quot;  Instead, Bryson fills the chapters with salient facts and anecdotes, capturing our attention in a fully satisfying way.  I finished the last page feeling that I knew quite a bit more about Down Under.  Through his unique and vivid wordage, Bryson captures the sheer immensity and wonder of this incredible place.  Not only does he make us want to go visit, he makes it seem as though we've already been.  Now that is the mark of a wonderful writer!	2002-05-22

In no-nonsense language, Moore creates memorable characters, men clawed from the hard earth they work for a living.  In this book, the McColleys face mystery, pain, and death.  Two of their own have died or disappeared, and a treasure of gold remains up for grabs.  Along the way, we discover the deep scars and broken dreams that reside in each of the character's hearts.  These men, when contrasted with their women and their faith, live to tell stories that should not be missed.  If you haven't read Moore's novels, now's the time to check them out.

Many of my favorite suspense novelists are gone and/or out-of-print...Alistair MacLean, Helen MacInnes, Robert Ludlum, and Morris West, to name a few.  I was beginning to bemoan my age when I came upon two encouraging books.  First, I saw Robert Littell's newest \\"The Company\\" and thought fondly back to \\"The Amateur\\" and \\"The Defection of A.J. LeWinter.\\"  Second, I ran across the newest Daniel Silva novel.<br />\\"The English Assassin\\" walks the tightrope between thrilling action-suspense and thoughtful storytelling.  Silva keeps things moving with murder, suicide, betrayal, suspicion, and hints of romance.  He also creates believable characters against this espionage backdrop.  Gabriel Allon, the art restorer/Israeli agent, is a classic hero in the John le Carre sense.  Gabriel wrestles with morals and inner demons, yet never comes across maudlin or overly sentimental.  Even his female lead, an emotionally and physically damaged violinist, seems strong enough in the midst of struggle to walk hand in hand with a man like Gabriel.<br />Although the setup at the beginning of the novel seemed very much like Ludlum's recent \\"The Sigma Protocol,\\" Silva takes a different route in unveiling the secrets and truth around the Swiss banking world and the stolen paintings.  Ludlum entertained, yes, but Silva entertains while making us think.  In fact, even as the novel comes to its conclusion, I wondered if I'd been duped by a shallow ending, only to discover another layer of justice.  (Will Gabriel and the English Assassin join forces in some future novel?)<br />Back to my original question...No, I'm not getting old, I'm just finding more great authors.  And Daniel Silva's now proven to be one of them.	2002-05-12

Darby Evan's grandmother gives her a challenge from her deathbed that sends Darby across the globe on a search for the truth.  While in Austria, she runs into Brant Collins, a man with a jaundiced eye and a tired heart.  Together, they must overcome suspicions, circumstances, shadowy villians, and their own insecurities.  Romance seeps in, but not in a sappy way.  Overall, the book moves from historical searching to romantic inklings to mystery delving.  Even the last pages contain a secret or two.<br />My wife and I read this book together, often aloud, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  Having travelled together through Austria, we were reminded of many delicious foods, beautiful sights, and memorable people.  We savored the story and the characters.  We ended it satisfied, but looking forward to the next Martinusen book, &quot;Blue Night,&quot; which we've already purchased.  Based on this first book, we figure we have another enjoyable set of evenings ahead of us.	2002-05-09

I know you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but it was the cover of &quot;Out of the Shadows&quot; that first got my attention.  Dark and mysterious, it hints of intrigue in the South, of mystery and secrets and drama.  And it accurately points to the success of Brouwer's writing.<br />This is great fiction.  With a strong hook in the prologue, Brouwer draws us into this modern-day mystery.  Through a series of flashbacks, we follow Nick Barrett's search for his mother, his ex-wife, his blackmailers...and for secrets he isn't even aware of.  Although the tension flags slightly through the middle of the tale, and the dialogue remains clipped, these characters come to life through solid storytelling.  As the plot turns tighter, the author parcels out more and more secrets so that the last fifty pages fly by.  What I thought would be a solid 4-star book became an enthusiastic 5-star recommendation after reaching the climax of this Southern mystery.<br />If you've read &quot;Double Helix&quot; and had a lukewarm reaction, let Brouwer prove to you that he's grown as a writer.  &quot;Out of the Shadows&quot; is a gripping story, with spiritual and emotional impact.  Having only recently moved to Nashville, I've decided that Sigmund Brouwer is one of this areas best-kept Southern secrets.	2002-04-26

Four college graduates head out on a worldwide journey to find purpose and meaning in relationship to God.  The writing is capable of communicating effectively and, having travelled myself in many of the countries mentioned, I found it to be accurate in describing the struggles of other peoples and nations.  Passion is present, as evidenced in the journal excerpts from each of the four sojourners.  What's missing is pain.  Sacrifice.  Temptation.  All the things each of us deal with--but which this book speaks rarely of.<br />I understand the demands of the Christian publishing world, yet I believe deeper insight into these men's lives would've been much more challenging to the readers they aim to influence.  We see so little of the financial struggles they go through to take this trip; we get only little hints of the temptations they face in the middle of other cultures; we find examples of sacrifice, but most of these are tamed by the short periods in each place and by the knowledge that their stories will be digested by others.  (Isn't it always easier to put up with troubles when you know others will know your response?)<br />Overall, I recommend this book.  It's an educational and challenging account.  It will push you to reevaluate your priorities.  If, in reading it, you feel you don't measure up to these four gentlemen, don't let it keep you from moving ahead.  Let their willingness to respond to God's call challenge you to do the same.  &quot;Four Souls&quot; were able to travel the world and live to tell about it.  This might be only the beginning.	2002-04-18

Unlike others here, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Skipping Christmas\\" for the light-hearted little fable it was, and I was impressed by the more serious effort of \\"A Painted House.\\"  But this?  Has he forgotten how to write an intricate, emotionally involving legal thriller?  The first few chapters read more like plot outlines and character sketches.  The dialogue is tired and sparse.  Even the basics of the plot sound strikingly similar to another present bestseller, \\"The Millionares,\\" by Brad Meltzer (a book with hipper characters, snappier dialogue, and more twists in the first 100 pages than in the entire length of \\"The Summons\\").<br />In \\"The Summons,\\" Professor Ray Atlee becomes the heir to over three million dollars.  Where did the money come from?  His honorable father, a long-standing judge, had no apparent connections to such wealth.  With only his drug-addicted brother to stand in the way, Ray spends most of the book trying to convince himself the money's not marked or counterfeit.  Oh, and trying to find out how his father acquired it.  In fact, we must witness three, yes three, separate trips to casinos for just these purposes--a sure sign that Grisham was low on plot ideas.  Along the way, we witness Atlee's interest in planes and in a gorgeous floozy who also happens to be his student, but these sidetrips have little to do with anything and only add to the final frustration.  I read over 300 pages for...what?<br />\\"The Summons,\\" like \\"The Brethren,\\" lacks any truly sympathetic or likeable characters (maybe because we never really get to know them).  At least Grisham hasn't resorted to farfetched plot twists, but I wish he'd give us at least something to hold onto, something to anticipate.  I kept waiting for something, anything to happen.  Instead, I reached the barely surprising elements of the last chapter only to wonder why I'd taken the time.<br />I'm still a fan of Grisham's older legal thrillers.  Until he proves otherwise, however, I'll stick to his non-legal books--they seem to be the ones with the brightest sparkle and life.older legal thrillers.

I purchased \\"Hangman's Curse\\" and asked if they'd like to read it together.  By the end of the first chapter, they started getting interested; by the end of the second, they were hooked, begging me to go on after every chapter.<br />Peretti makes the story accessible to kids (mine are not yet 10 yrs old), but also intelligent enough for the older crowd.  He follows the exploits of a young family involved in the investigation of mysterious happenings.  Going undercover, the entire family--even the dog, Mr. Maxwell--take part in unmasking the dark happenings at a troubled high school.  Students are falling under a debilitating spell and all signs point to evil curses as the cause.  The family, trusting in God and in their individual talents, works to prove that Godly truth reigns supreme over spiritual delusion.  In the midst of the suspense, Peretti also makes some points regarding troubled kids and how they respond in our culture.  He states valuable arguments regarding morality and relativism in a manner that kids can understand.  He also throws in humor to lighten the darker and more mysterious moods.<br />Bottom line: My kids were hooked and they can't wait for the next book in \\"The Veritas Project\\" (they're even begging for a movie version), and I had just as much fun reading it with them.  The next in the series will be first on our list.	2002-04-17

His short stories, by their very nature, move from conflict to climax without much ado.  They are preachy, pedantic, and allegorical--and I love them.  \\"...Seven Gables\\" moves along at a much slower pace, developing symbolism and characters with greater subtlety and depth.  The plot itself is not much deeper than one of his short stories.  We watch humbled, yet strong Hepzibah struggle for a living from a one room shop in the house.  Along the way, she meets a variety of characters and becomes host and confidant to a long-lost relative, gentle Phoebe.  Phoebe is sunlight, poking into the shadows of the gabled house, bringing vivacity to its occupants, Hepzibah, Clifford, and Holgrave.  Yes, Hawthorne hints at sinister things in the past and present of the old house, but only with the arrival of Judge Pyncheon do we begin to suspect trouble brewing.<br />The conclusion of the book involves death and hidden riches and suspicions and redemption.  The symbols throughout--the house, the chimney, the elm tree, the chickens, etc.--manage to reveal their purposes in due time.  In a satisfactory manner, Hawthorne contrasts the insidious nature of religious hypocrisy with the virtues of honesty and gentle love.  The horrors of the Pyncheons' past fade away in the light of Phoebe's commitment and care.  Her time in the house brings life to all within...all except one.<br />Hawthorne could've encapsulated this tale in one of his short stories.  He could've sliced away words with meticulous demand.  Instead, he allows us to know and care for the people in his story.  Some readers, granted, will find it difficult to care and will call it a waste of their time; sure, it takes a little effort.  But, just as Phoebe and Hepzibah display sacrificial love, a reader who's willing to give the time might find worthwhile rewards by the book's end.<br />If you're already a fan, you'll enjoy it.  I certainly did.  If it seems too long, try some of his short works and work up your appetite for these heartier courses.  This is rich stuff.joy it.  I certainly did.

This trilogy now ranks as one of my favorite series ever.  I was awed by the premise of the first book \\"In His Image,\\" blown away by the pace of the second \\"Birth of an Age,\\" and absolutely floored by the payoff of the third \\"Acts of God.\\"<br />James BeauSeigneur starts this book in the middle of the Anti-christ's deceptive maneuvers.  Once again, we follow the false messiah's aide (and father-figure), Decker Hawthorne, as he works for the United Nations, helping bring promised peace and prosperity to the planet under the guise of the New Age.<br />BeauSeigneur dives straight into the action in this final book of \\"The Christ Clone Trilogy.\\"  He unravels the truth behind some of the characters' backgrounds, gives a rousing defense of Yeshua as Messiah, and then leads us straight into the terror of the plagues of Revelation.  The biblical accuracy in this fictional setting is superlative.  With passion and no-holds-barred writing, BeauSeigneur exposes us to horrors beyond what we might've imagined while thumbing clinically through the prophecies.  He brings these ideas and truths home, slamming them into our heads after having tickled our ears.  When we reach the climax, the moment of Decker Hawthorne's confrontation with his own son, the author tells the story with unsettling and stunning clarity. Even the cover photo will send chills down your spine after concluding this novel.<br />This series, while entertaining me, renewed my interest in the end-time prophecies and my commitment to 'stand firm.' To bypass \\"The Christ Clone Trilogy\\" is to miss out on a treat.  To skip this final book is to miss the whole point.  Simply put, you can't afford to avoid the \\"Acts of God.\\"	2002-03-31
1602095:US	50287514	R3LGG30Y17TQKQ	0849943183	942699962	The Sacrifice	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	3 and 1/2 Stars...More Romance Than Legal Thriller	After reading Whitlow's first two books, I was apt to label him the Christian market's John Grisham.  \\"The List\\" had a terrific premise that spurred it along with elements of the supernatural.  \\"The Trial\\" had an intriguing legal case that involved lawyers and courtrooms and clues and misdirection.  \\"The Sacrifice\\" starts with similar aspects, then veers away from the legal twists, using them mainly as props for a deftly handled love story.<br />The story initially revolves around a high-school kid indicted in a racial shooting, then begins to lean more heavily on the budding relationship between lawyer Scott Ellis and school teacher Kay Wilson, and finally reaches its climax with the growing menace of another of Kay's students.  Whitlow throws in some comic dialogue and touching moments.  He tackles the issue of divorce and Christian dating in a straightforward and sympathetic manner.  I appreciated the relationship between Scott and Kay.  It is sincere and thoughtful.  Unfortunately, it rarely reaches too deep into her marital troubles or too far into his physical/moral struggles in the blossoming friendship.  I also appreciated the irony that Scott, a Vietnam vet, receives an act of love from a Southeast Asian janitor.<br />While the story moves along with a number of loosely connected subplots, the romantic relationship is the catalyst to read on.  Or, more accurately, it should be the catalyst...Some of the story's other building conflicts lead to predictable results, despite the apparent efforts to occasionally mislead.    Whitlow's words of wisdom are worthwhile, well worded, and connected to the events of the story, but they often come through his omniscient narrative rather than through his characters.  For me, this was somewhat distracting.<br />Although the cover of \\"The Sacrifice\\" might lead you to believe it's more closely related to the suspense of Whitlow's first two books, this novel should be read on its own merits.  Technically, I would not classify it as a legal thriller.  Overall, I'd recommend this book for those seeking believable romance with hints of legal dealings and touches of Christian homiletics.	2002-03-28

Ludlum hooked me with \\"The Gemini Contenders\\" and \\"The Bourne Identity.\\"  Then, for quite a while, it seemed he ran out of ideas.  Based on the reviews here, I decided to give this one a shot.  (A few months ago, I tried \\"The Matarese Countdown\\" and gave up.)<br />Yes, this is everything you expect from Ludlum, good and bad: the bold, beyond belief plot; the nonstop action; the twists and turns and surprises...the predictable super-conspiracy story; the events that stretch belief; the heroes that can fly helicopters when in trouble because of some obscure training years and years ago.<br />\\"The Sigma Protocol\\" is vintage Ludlum.  We follow the story of wealthy Ben Hartman as he attempts to unravel the mysteries of his brother's death, his father's identity, and the attacks on his own life.  We also watch Anna Navarro, a government agent, as she studies the string of deaths of old men related to the Sigma Corporation and tries to connect them.  That's only the surface of all that appears here and, as usual, Ludlum plays a few cards to his chest, but for the most part, pulls out all the stops and goes for the money.  If you aim to be educated or enlightened by your fiction, this isn't the book for you.  If you're ready for a satisfying escape that also pokes at the globalization issues we now face, then jump right in.<br />Ludlum ends his incredible and lively tale with a benediction from Ben Hartman's lips to his father.  I couldn't help but wonder if these were words Ludlum hoped to hear as he approached his own mortality.  \\"I judge him mortal.  I judge him imperfect...And I judge him a hero...And because he was hard to love, I loved him all the harder...\\"<br />Yes, it's melodramatic, over-the-top...just as our dear Robert Ludlum. I'll miss his books.  And I'll always \\"judge him a hero.\\"	2002-03-24

With great clarity and shocking delivery, James BeauSeigneur continues his trilogy in \\"Birth of an Age,\\" revealing the destruction of prophesied plagues and the deception of the anti-Christ.  What makes this series stand out is that BeauSeigneur plays the devil's advocate, spouting New Age rhetoric through the mouths of his characters and leaving us to wonder just how this will all play out.  Sure, we've heard the sermons and conjecture, but the Christ Clone Trilogy speaks louder than most other vehicles by taking us into the middle of the action, the horror, and the twisted logic of the anti-Christ's plans.  The author manages to approach age-old prophecies with fresh insight and imaginative depictions, some of which will leave you terrified.  I've been burned out since childhood on the end-times theories, but this series makes it all so real, alive, and ceaselessly entertaining.  Buttressed by massive research, \\"Birth of an Age\\" takes us to the brink of a brighter future...or does it?<br />I was going to hold off on the third book, but I've changed my mind.

In the first book, chess was the vehicle for exploring genius; in &quot;Canone Inverso,&quot; music is the mode.<br />This short, yet complex book, follows the story of a violin and its series of owners.  Through the eyes of a modern day music enthusiast, we meet young musicians of Austria who were subjected to prison-like training regimes, and old men who bear the scars of their abilities.<br />Maurensig, himself, displays the two sides of genius in his work.  At times, I find myself enthralled with his characters and descriptions; at other times, I'm perplexed and disturbed by the places they take us.  This author seems intimately familiar with the seduction of art and its ability to eventually take us captive.  Rather than enjoy the art (music, chess, or what have you) for its own sake, we are susceptible to the desire for perfection, for greatness, for immortality.  And this struggle is precisely what Maurensig explores in the convoluted tale of Kuno Blau and Jeno Varga.  The twisted thinking of genius is in full display here and only in the final pages do we get a clear picture of the truth.<br />But don't expect the author to put all the puzzle pieces together for you.  He's too smart for that, and he expects you to be as well.  To read his stories is to be taken captive by the same artistic allure of his characters.  To reach the end is to resist the temptation and master the beast.  &quot;Canone Inverso&quot; refers to a countdown or descent in music.  This book, indeed, is a descent into the tortured mind of one who strives for acclaim, fame, family, and self-discovery.<br />What Arturo Perez-Reverte attempts to do in his literary mysteries, such as &quot;The Flanders Panel,&quot; Maurensig manages to do in half the space.  Although the interaction between his characters is limited and the depiction of mental decay tedious, you will find the themes explored to be strangely unique, yet universal.mited and the depiction of mental decay tedious, you will find the themes explored to be strangely unique, yet universal.	2002-03-08

Forget for a moment this is the fourth book in a series.  Forget you've been following characters whose lives are enmeshed in the drama of mid-1948 and the struggle for Israeli independence.  For 250 pages, imagine you are discovering the incredible back-story to this modern conflict in Jerusalem.<br />The Thoenes break new ground here, jumping back two millenia to unravel the story of Mary (Miryam) Magdalene and her connections to the life of Jesus (Yeshua).  I've admired the Thoenes ability to recreate the era of the 1930's and 40's, but to see them jump to 30 A.D...Wow!  The transition is seamless.  I was quickly transported to the troubled times and life of young Miryam and her centurion lover.  I found myself caught up in the story and surprised at the ease with which the authors slipped fiction into the historical framework.  In these pages, the Thoenes do wonders, making the lives and relationships of those represented in the Gospels come alive.  They breathe fresh perspective into this oft-told tale and make it wholly believable and accessible for a modern reader.<br />From what I understand, the next book or two in The Jerusalem Legacy will continue the biblical back-story.  (This book ends at the point of Jesus meeting with the woman caught in adultery.)  Although I wish the Thoenes had finished their present series and made the story of these scrolls into its own entity, I'll certainly look forward to the continuation...of both.  While remaining true to the known facts and to the spirit of the Bible, the Thoenes delve into the hearts and minds of those who later became known in the Scriptures.  I'll never see Mary or the centurion or Caiaphas the same.  Through &quot;The Jerusalem Scrolls&quot; they've become living, breathing people.  With style and great sensitivity, this book shows once again why the Thoenes are one of the best writing teams going.	2002-03-06

Since my childhood days seated on hard floors in darkened church gymnasiums where end-time movies played with seventies schmaltz, where the only thing left behind was any feeling in my buns, I've wondered why so many get fixated on this subject of the apocalypse.  Out of curiousity, I caved in and read the first few \\"Left Behind\\" books.  I soon found myself frustrated by the lack of depth.<br />Then, on a friend's recommendation, I gambled on \\"The Christ Clone Trilogy.\\"  Man alive!  This first book convinced me there is hope for this sub-genre.  James BeauSeigneur paints a broad and sprawling canvas that, nonetheless, remains focused.  He mixes in biblical prophecy, Jewish tradition, scientific study, and political intrigue.  He startles with his twists and turns.  He creates a believable and entertaining scenario for the earth's last days, as spoken of in the Bible, yet leaves us guessing as to where he's taking us.  Judging by his research and the conversations of his Messianic Jew characters, I'm willing to believe that all will be revealed in its time.<br />The author does, I must warn you, use a few naughty words--you know, the ones that you could find in old western books. (Not the hangup for me that it seems to be with a few other reviewers.)  BeauSeigneur doesn't get caught up in much character development; he lets the framework of the plot reveal these people to us.  Considering the scope of this story, he still manages to maintain our interest in the individual characters, and I guess that's all we need.  Sure, they lack some of the emotional intrigue of the \\"Left Behind\\" books, but at least I didn't feel I was being duped by corny twists and off-the-wall late-morning-TV drama.<br />Most amazing of all, to me, is that BeauSeigneur has put so much of his own time and self into the publication of the book.  I'd love to see his stuff in the hands of a big-time publisher who could do some minor editing and give this book the attention it deserves.

What I expected to be an in-depth look at &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; turns out to be more like a daily devotional, with short chapters that sum up Biblical ideas as seen in Tolkien's work.  The idea is laudable; the execution only scratches the surface.<br />First, let's make it clear that Tolkien never intended his works to be allegorical--most fans know this already.  On the other hand, he said that &quot;In 'The Lord of the Rings' the conflict is not basically about 'freedom', though that is naturally involved.  It is about God, and His sole right to divine honour.&quot; (The Letters of JRR Tolkien, pg. 243)  It is impossible to read Tolkien without taking into account the context of his faith.  For that reason, &quot;Finding God in the Lord of the Rings&quot; is a book that many have waited for.  While it may satisfy the thirst of some, it will only whet the appetite for others.  Overall, I recommend what the authors have done here.  They write clearly and with great affection for Tolkien's writing; they speak plainly of Godly characteristics throughout this fantasy epic; they do not, however, plunge headlong into the deeper waters that I hoped to explore.<br />I'll enjoy this book as a coffee-table piece, one to be thumbed through for daily thoughts and encouragements.  For more insight to Tolkien's meanings, I'll turn back to his own letters.	2002-02-16

He consistently (four novels now) tells a captivating story rich with spiritual truth.  His characters are credible, sometimes even complex, and the pace is often breakneck.<br /><br />\\"Thunder of Heaven\\" continues The Martyr's Song Series, but it also stands alone.  For those who've followed the series, it's fun to see how Dekker incorporates Helen and Father Teuwen and even mentions a link to Kent Anthony.  For those just discovering Dekker's writing, you'll have no problem following the story.<br /><br />Dekker deals with current issues: terrorism, God's love, and our human desire for revenge.  He tackles these topics without flinching, yet shows grace and integrity throughout.  His two main characters are Shannon and Tanya, a man and a woman who first met in the jungles of Venezuela.  Their lives take violent and separate paths and eight years later they find each other again, back in the jungles...This time, they are there to stop a terrorist plot aimed at striking a nuclear blow to America.<br /><br />Dekker handles certain scenes with great depth and accuracy.  (His depiction of the inner workings of a nuclear weapon were fascinating, for example.)  At other points, he breaks the mood for me when his characters are constantly swallowing nervously or feeling pain flashing along their spines.  He mentions, too, the man who killed Hitler.  Huh?  Hitler, according to the most recognized reports, committed suicide.<br /><br />Aside from these complaints and, for me, the over-romanticized scenes of the first chapter, I would rank this as one of the best page-turners ever from the Christian market.  Dekker, in short time, has outclassed most other writers in this genre of Christian fiction.  Not only does he entertain with a bang, he aims to hit you between the eyes with Godly truth as well.  Don't miss out!	2002-02-14

With time and forgiveness under my belt, I cracked open \\"Heartwood\\" and found myself swept away.  The story has an actual plot, the characters have true struggles, and the narrative flows with sympathy and violence in incongruous dance.<br />Let's face it, few people can write with the descriptive and allegorical power of Burke.  If anything, it can be overwhelming at times, although I prefer to think of it as intoxicating.  Then, to keep things in check, Burke pens some of the most forceful dialogue that you'll ever run across this side of the Elmore Leonard and Dashiell Hammett.  His characters are electric with their moral conflicts and emotional hangups.<br />\\"Heartwood,\\" for me, encapsulated all the things Burke does well: the dialogue, narrative, Greek tragedy themes, and eventual redemption at a price.  Yes, it harkens to the Robicheaux books, but I'm warming up to Billy Bob Holland and beginning to see him as his own fictional entity.  Although this series lacks the humorous sidekick of a Clete Purcell, it hits home with powerful story and truth.<br />Mr. Burke, you're starting to convince me...spending time with Billy Bob and Temple Carrol has its payoffs.  Do I sense a hint of romance even?  I can't wait to read \\"Bitterroot,\\" the next in the series.	2002-02-13

From the humorous segments of &quot;The Police Log&quot; to the gripping drama of the 1200 mile Iditarod race, Peter Jenkins helps us find Alaska.  In his easygoing style, he takes us behind the doors of everyday Alaskans, as well as some very influential ones, and lets us taste, smell, and feel the adventure of northern life.  He also reveals the tedium, the loneliness, and the dangers.<br />At moments, I found myself awed by the grandeur and scope of this great state; at other times, I laughed out loud--in public, I might add--at Peter's candid storytelling.  Who, after reading this, could forget the bachelor auction?  Or the toe-numbing descriptions of the winter trail?  Or the sorrowful Tina, as she struggles with her heritage and her future?<br />This is what Peter does so well: he tells great stories.  I can almost imagine, as I read his books (all of which I've enjoyed), that he's telling me the accounts over a campfire.  He comes across in an honest and unaffected manner.  He wears his heart and his spirituality on his sleeve.  He lets us see behind the facades of capitalistic life in America.<br />On the other hand, his writing is downright clunky at times.  I have to force myself to &quot;hear&quot; him tell the story, as opposed to editing the numerous odd sentences and wasted words.  In fact, I wish a thoughtful editor had waded through here sentence by sentence.  At certain points, Peter jumps from past to past perfect tense to present perfect all in one paragraph.  It's the way people talk, yes; however, for me, it was a constant distraction.<br />Don't let my comments turn you away.  &quot;Looking for Alaska&quot; is everything I expected and more.  If people and places fascinate you, Peter will not disappoint you.  Cuddle up with this book and discover new things with a man who writes from his heart.

The amount of research and detail that Brock's research brings to Bodie's talented writing is amazing.  The combination is enthralling for history and fiction buffs.  This book, like the others in the series, races from start to finish with tight plotting and razor-thin scenes.  If anything, it can be overwhelming at times.  Don't try to stretch this book out over a few weeks; you'll have difficulty keeping things straight.  This story is meant to be swallowed and digested quickly.<br />Which is not to say that it's a fast-food diet.  Bodie Thoene delivers rich metaphors here.  From the Khamseen winds at the opening, to the Hurva at the heart of Jerusalem, this story strikes deep into the struggle for Israeli independence and the personal struggle for salvation through the Messiah.  Without preaching, the Thoenes tell of powerful grace and love in the midst of horrific bloodshed.  The message of valor and courage rings true in light of the terrors the Jews endured.<br />If you're a fan of the series, this book is a must.  It'll go down quick and easy, and still leave you satisfied with the sustenance of good writing.  (As a side-note, don't turn to the maps for help in deciphering the story...some of the major settings aren't even listed, such as Latrun.)  With the secrets still waiting to be revealed at the end of this story, I'm anxious to plunge into the next, &quot;The Jerusalem Scrolls.&quot;	2002-02-04

Here, six months later, I still see those scenes in my mind, still feel the emotions of those characters.  The first book in \\"Tyrants and Kings\\" stuck with me much longer than I expected.  I should've given it 5 stars.<br />\\"The Grand Design\\" is no less impressive.  John Marco, in a deceptively easy style, draws characters both likeable and despicable, sympathetic and pathetic.  He takes these characters with all their flaws and foibles and knits them into a plot that remains intricate without ever being confusing.  This alone is quite a feat.  To find myself caring about so many people, even minor players and evil ones, is further proof of Marco's fictional powers.  I will not soon forget Vorto's attack at the beginning, the 'army of the air' at Dragon's Beak, the enigmatic Simon Darquis, or the toymaker and his young accomplice, Lorla.  I was happy to reunite with the anti-hero Richius Vartran and his wife Dyana.  I was moved and disturbed by the fates of Eris and Prakna and even young Shii.<br />John Marco concludes this book rather quickly.  I actually hoped (after reading 785 pages!) that he would flesh out the final scenes a bit more.  But can I blame him for running out of steam?  Giving him the benefit of the doubt, I believe he wraps this up suddenly only so that he might lead us into the final book \\"The Saints of the Sword.\\"  My interest piqued and my emotions not yet satiated, I plan to jump straight into the finale.  I'm a firm Marco fan.<br />Final note: I ran across Marco's new book, \\"The Eyes of God,\\" yesterday at the bookstore.  It looks equally captivating.  Lorris and Pris!  Too many good books, too little time.	2002-01-20

Mindless commentary on Tolkien's writings?  Or, ideally, something special?<br />Something special!  Indeed.  If I could go back in time and sit with Tolkien and friends while they smoked pipes and discussed their writings, this is what I'd overhear.  If I could pick Tolkien's brain on many subjects considering the Ring and Middle Earth, these are the sorts of things he'd say.  These letters cover a wide range of topics over a number of years and point directly to the source of Tolkien's inspirations.  Questions that have long lay dormant in my mind sprung to life and found reprieve here within these stunning letters.<br />Do you wonder about the spiritual implications of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;?  Do you wish for insight into Tolkien's relationship with C.S. Lewis?  Do you pine for the day you could've had Tolkien respond to your own questions?  This side of eternity, &quot;The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien&quot; may be the closest you'll come to satisfying these itchings.  If you're a fan, this is indispensable.

Perhaps Brown, a former TV anchorman, could give this overworked idea a good kick in the pants.<br />Brown comes through with flying colors.<br />The premise: Twelve contestants, on an island, are involved in a &quot;Survivor&quot;-like TV series that turns ugly when an unknown entity informs them they have all been infected with a deadly designer virus.  Based on the TV audience's votes, one contestant will be refused the daily antidote and will die a horrible death.  It's a modern and macabre twist on the old lifeboat analogy.<br />Okay, so as a reader I found myself appalled and entranced by the horrors of Brown's tale.  He quickly thrust me into the action and the next thing you know...I was hooked.  I primarily read during my lunch-breaks in our employee cafeteria.  With fork in hand, shovelling food into my mouth (successfully, in most cases), I raced through the pages to discover the story's ending.  24/7 jumps all over the place and follows a parade of characters, yet maintains an amazing congruity.  Brown juggles a dozen subplots without dropping a single one.  By the end, I was exhausted by the energy and intricate structure that brought the story to its conclusion.<br />Despite these plaudits, I must say that the story stretches credibility on more than one occasion.  As with reality TV, I got the feeling more than once that this whole thing was rigged, that it wasn't as believable as it wanted me to think it was.  The characters are brief, but memorable sketches, and the plot threads tie off nicely, if not too conveniently.  Overall, 24/7 became a guilty pleasure.  I couldn't put it down, though it seemed so shallow at its core.<br />Or maybe that was the very point.  The irony of it all.<br />By ensnaring me in his thriller's web, Jim Brown showed me that I, like so many, am willing to &quot;tune in&quot; to see what'll happen, even if it means sacrificing my time, ethics, and integrity.  Like his fictional TV audience, I was mentally voting death for the characters I disliked...and in so doing, I underlined the story's basic moral: In a society fueled by entertainment and false reality, we quickly sink to our lowest common denominator.  Brown uses the very methods that'll attract his targets to slap them in the face with this harsh truth.<br />Okay, Jim, I learned my lesson...Are you ready to teach me another?ing my time, ethics, and integrity.

I liked 'A Walk in the Woods,' so let's see if this is any good.&quot;<br />That was my line of thinking as I checked out this book from my local library.  On the way home, I opened the cover (akin to opening a bag of my favorite chips) and sampled a bite.  And another.  Soon, I was eight chapters into the thing, wiping tears from my eyes to the amusement of my wife and children.  Then, the ultimate test: I read a page out loud to my wife.  Now I'm not intimating that she has any laughter inhibitions--she'll laugh up a storm within the first minutes of a good comedy flick--but to subject her to oral readings is to watch her mood take a serious downswing.  Must be the expectation levels I project.  (&quot;Come on, honey, don't you get it?  Are you listening?&quot;)<br />Test results: A+<br />Next thing I knew, I was fighting my wife for moments to gobble down another chapter or two.  No kidding.  Bill Bryson, in his inimitable manner, adds punch and humor to subjects normally as tastless as...well, as week-old chips.  He pinpoints the lunacies in our daily routine, the frustrations of red-tape, and the nostalgia of yesteryear.  He makes me wonder why we Americans behave in such ways, then leaves me shaking my head at the idea of living anywhere else.<br />We're all strangers, in one way or another, in this diverse land of ours.  And that's just it...it's our crazy kaleidoscope of ideas and customs that make us the colorful nation we are.  I wouldn't trade it for the world.  Thanks, Bill, for helping me let off some steam so that I can fall in love with this place all over again.	2002-01-09

Ted Dekker, teamed here with Bill Bright, has the ability (as evidenced in his last two novels) to create suspenseful stories with spiritual themes.  He mixes flawed characters and romantic notions with Godly truth and memorable climaxes.<br />&quot;Blessed Child,&quot; like Alton Gansky's &quot;The Prodigal,&quot; follows the story of a gifted young boy and the ordeals he faces.  With the assistance of a Peace Corps worker and a nurse, young Caleb must stand against the political, religious, and demonic forces that oppose him.  The religious nuts and the opportunistic moneymongers come out of the woodwork, and, to make things more interesting, a presidential candidate with secrets to hide decides that Caleb is a threat to his campaign.<br />The story drags in places, and the bad guys (Crandal, Father Nikolous, Martha) are more cardboard props than actual characters with motivations, but Dekker makes sure to tease us to the end with bits of information.  I was intrigued by Crandal's secrets in Ethiopia, but, upon reaching the end, felt slighted that we never see any evidence of that which he was looking for.  This fact alone made it hard for me to swallow his aspect of the story.<br />Nevertheless, &quot;Blessed Child&quot; will keep you reading to the end.  The romantic gestures and the spiritual insights are worth every page.  Dekker and Bright bring the kingdom of heaven to light in a beautiful and awe-inspiring manner.<br />If this is your first Dekker book, you must go back and read his &quot;Martyr's Song Series.&quot;  The first two books are great, and the third (&quot;Thunder of Heaven&quot;) is coming out in late February, I believe.  If your appetite for supernaturally gifted children is still there, try Gansky's &quot;The Prodigal.&quot;  If your looking for the Christian fiction trendsetters, keep Ted Dekker in mind.	2002-01-07

With honed words and dispassionate facts, he takes us into the drama and horror of situations around the globe.  His skill is apparent through each chapter of this book. In the beginning, he tells us that he started his previous book &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; intending to write of dangerous professions around the world, not just that of commercial fishermen.  In &quot;Fire&quot; he gives us insight into more than one dangerous occupation; thus, the book might be more aptly titled &quot;Danger Zones.&quot;<br />&quot;Fire,&quot; however, falls short of its billing.  The title and cover lend one to believe Junger will follow the lives of a fire crew battling a blaze, as he did with commercial fishermen facing &quot;The Perfect Storm.&quot;  But this book is actually old news.  The chapters are reprinted articles (some outdated in information and some redundant in their research).  The scenes are vivid and full of engrossing detail, yet lose some of their power in the retelling and in the disjointed stitching of mismatched pieces.  I felt that his chapter &quot;Colter's Way&quot; would've made a nice lead up to the more current stories, and his chapter about his own boyhood brush with danger could've set the book's pace with a personal touch.  Instead, &quot;Fire&quot; broke out in too many places and I lost my zeal to keep reading.  Halfway through, I had to consciously choose to continue.  I hope Junger brings us some fresh stuff next time around.  Until then, I'm feeling only lukewarm.	2002-01-04

In the fortress-like heights of Rora, the Waldenses manage to stage miraculous victories over the far superior numbers of Marquis Pianessa's armies.  Over and over, Gianavel holds off the marauders with strategic wisdom, heroic feats, and--never to be forgotten--Godly faith.  In the light of the religion's gross errors, Gianavel's faith alone provides hope in the midst of brutal battle scenes and violent depictions.  This book is not for the queasy.  This is history brought to horrible and astonishing life.  This is hate and bigotry displayed in all its ugliness.  This is Godly light seen as a flared match in the darkness of the blackest times.<br />I've read most of James Byron Huggins other works and found them thrilling but often overwrought with pretensions of grandeur.  Here, Huggins matches all that he's ever strived for.  This style of historical fiction finds Huggins at the top of his abilities.  &quot;Rora&quot; not only brings to life the actual characters that were given animal form in his earlier book &quot;A Wolf's Story,&quot; it also shows the gamut of human emotions in the midst of a siege...honor, betrayal, love, hate, and genuine faith in God.  I was moved by the human face of heroism and brutality.  I was challenged by the steadfastness of a man who stood at his moment in time and refused to back down against overwhelming odds.  &quot;Rora&quot; is a book to cherish--for its historical veracity and for its spiritual truths.	2001-12-25

After the wonderful first 150 pages, the setting changed so drastically that I wondered if I was reading the same book.  Perhaps a broader title would've better prepared me.  Hey, how can I knock a book that brought me to tears on two occasions?  On the other hand, how can I highly recommend a book that makes you plod through the final hundred pages to reach an inevitable conclusion?<br />Nicholas Evans evokes scenery and natural beauty like few other fiction writers.  On top of that, he does a decent job of creating character and dialogue, of capturing the nuances of relationships.  With &quot;The Smoke Jumper,&quot; Evans takes us into the lives of four interesting people--not all of whom will survive to the end of the tale--and asks us to follow along obediently.  For the first third of the story, I was willing to follow.  The plot moved quickly, and I actually cared about these characters as they faced personal trauma, forest fires, rock climbing, and outdoor survival.  The twists were subtle, yet effective.  I was intrigued and would've rated it five stars up to that point.<br />The next portion was a bit rockier.  I, like one of the characters, felt as though I was following blindly.  Exhibiting trust in the author's skill?  No doubt.  Hoping that this journey would lead to unpredictable places?  You bet.  Although Evans maneuvers through the emotions and difficulties of this section gracefully, I still felt as though I was being set up for the...drum-roll, please...obvious anti-climax.<br />And I was right.  The story moves so far from its original setting and course that I felt I was reading an entirely different novel.  &quot;The Smoke Jumper&quot; comes around at the end and delivers, as expected.  On the last page, Evans even manages to pull together the horse, wolf, and fire themes of his three books.  And that may be the problem: perhaps Evans felt driven to make this book broader, bigger, grander.  In my opinion, he should have stuck to one theme.  What started out hot, by the end...was not.uld have stuck to one theme.  What started out hot, by the end...was not.	2001-12-19

The opening pages alone had me convinced I was plunging into something special, something beyond the usual bounds of predictable fiction.<br />&quot;Peace Like a River&quot; is a classic in the grand tradition, which means it's beautiful, ageless, and...yes, a bit slow-moving.  Enger's narrator, young Jeremiah Land, tells his story with remarkable verbosity, initially inspiring awe, later doubt, finally belief.  Enger risks all by shooting for the heavens, and, for the most part, he succeeds.<br />The story, set in the Midwest in the early 60s, follows the motherless Land family.  The youngest son, Jeremiah, communicates the story of the struggles they face when the oldest son goes to trial for murder.  His fate, and the family's along with him, take turns that are unpredictable while strangely inevitable.  Peopled with memorable characters, &quot;Peace Like a River&quot; reminded me more than once of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; and the more recent &quot;This Rock,&quot; both coming-of-age type tales set in rural America.  Enger's characters, however, while imminently touchable, seem also larger than life...The father speaks face-to-face with God; the daughter is a poet beyond her years (almost to the point of stretching belief); the youngest son views life through asthmatic afflictions and the self-centeredness of a child.  Somehow, these people draw the reader into events both moving and miraculous.  But, along the way, the story does begin to meander, to lose some of its luster.  Some might even want to head for shore and stop reading altogether.<br />Don't do it. By the end, &quot;Peace Like a River&quot; chooses its course and sets sail for distant lands.  There are sentences here that'll make you laugh, that'll take your breath away, that'll open your eyes anew.  In particular, the second to last chapter is an awe-inspiring vision of those first steps toward eternity.<br />Enough said.

In &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;, Grisham brings us a tale that is very believable in its motivations.  Who among us hasn't bellyached about the madness of the holiday season?<br />Something different from Grisham's other books, this is a short gift of a tale, a one-sitting fable that reminds us to keep our priorities right in the midst of holiday chaos.  Luther and Nora Krank are wonderful protagonists, entwined in their own plot to skip Christmas.  The ending, if a bit predictable, is still likely to bring laughs and tears.  Grisham touches us in a simple and effective manner.  My wife and I, joined on the couch, had to put the book down a couple of times to regain control after particularly comedic scenes.  (Did I mention wiping my eyes on my sleeves?) Through it's simplicity, the story works, the message sinks in, and--if I'm one to predict the future--the TV movie will be out by next Yuletide.  (Yes, my wife and I will watch.)	2001-12-02

Dorchester	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Good Writing...Faulty Marketing	I'm an avid fiction reader.  &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; and &quot;HMS Ulysess&quot; are some of the best novels I've read regarding the sea.  Occasionally I'll delve into adventurous nonfiction; I found &quot;The Perfect Storm,&quot; &quot;Into Thin Air,&quot; and &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; to be modern classics.<br />&quot;Sea of Glory&quot; is a story worth telling and I can't help but recommend it, however...I think the publisher makes a big mistake.  &quot;Sea of Glory&quot; is a nonfiction account marketed as a novel.  This is misleading to big fiction readers like myself.  This is not well-constructed fiction: it spends four separate chapters introducing the main characters in a nonfictional format, then spends the rest of the book trying to be a novel.  &quot;Sea of Glory,&quot; like &quot;In the Heart of the Sea,&quot; could have been told in a reconstructive nonfiction manner that allows some liberty on the author's part while maintaining the intregrity and suspense of events that actually happened.<br />Yes, this story is well-paced and well-written.  I'd recommend it for its content alone.  It does, however, fail to live up the best in either fiction or nonfiction genres.  This book is full of inconsistencies...The cover art is top-notch, but the words along the bottom have typos (should be &quot;WWII&quot;, not &quot;WW II&quot;...&quot;the story of four chaplains&quot;, not &quot;the story of the four chaplains&quot;).  With better planning on the publisher's end, I think this book could have been elevated to a higher level.  As it stands, &quot;Sea of Glory&quot; is a moving account of Godly men in the midst of combat.  In light of our present struggles as a nation, this book should be an encouragement and a challenge to believers everywhere.	2001-11-18

Mrs. Pollifax first sucked me into her slightly off-kilter espionage adventures back in the early 80s.  As a teenage boy, I was proud to relate to such a spunky spy--who cared what the other kids thought!<br />I picked up &quot;...Unveiled&quot; with fond memories and found myself quickly drawn into Mrs. Pollifax's simplified, but fun, world of spies and intrigue.  Sure, the story is somewhat predictable, but the fun level is perfect for those looking for a light weekend (or single evening) read.

Are you intrigued by their spiritual leanings?  This book sets out to demystify one of the most successful rock bands in history.  Where others have crashed and burned, U2 has sped steadily onward.  Where others have flamed out in a one-hit blaze of glory, U2 continues to reinvent themselves without ever betraying their own personality.<br />&quot;Walk On&quot; takes on quite a challenge by attempting to draw some lines about U2's spiritual (ie. Christian) purposes.  I've loved U2 since first hearing &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; in a friend's living room back in the early 80's and, like many others, I've always wondered where they stood in regards to God, the church, religious hypocrisy, etc.  Steve Stockman manages to amass and present a heady mix of information, culled from interviews, concerts, etc.  He defines U2's apparent mission from an artistic and spiritual standpoint, but refrains from boxing them in.  He brings to light info that I've long looked for and never found.  He makes U2 into a living, breathing, touchable band while further elevating them to the pinnacles of rock history.<br />If I had one complaint here, it's that Stockman resorts to personal diatribes here and there.  He not only interprets U2's motivations, he takes a personal stand on issues that U2 doesn't directly address.  That's okay, of course, but it moves this book away from a purely journalistic foundation and turns it into a great look at U2 coupled with a few mini-sermons.<br />I applaud anyone willing to peel back the layers of a much loved band.  Not only do we see the genius of U2's music, we see the gut-wrenching decisions and soul-searching they go through.  This book is worth the money if you want to know the heart of U2.  Just be warned: you might also know more than you wanted of the heart of Steve Stockman.	2001-11-16

To be more accurate, this a novella that requires no more than 75 minutes to read.  75 minutes that could bring hope and reconciliation.  Turn off that sitcom and enjoy a worthy story.<br />Peretti, with ease and grace, relates the story of Dan and Kathy.  This couple has teenage kids, years of marriage, but something dark has come between them.  Kathy confines herself to her bed, burdened by secrets that threaten her soul and her family.  As the story unfolds, we discover the truth about the graveyard pictured on the front cover--and Kathy discovers the truth of God's love and forgiveness, despite her shortcomings.<br />Other reviews have attacked Peretti's theological approach to abortion here, but this is not a theological book about abortion.  It's a book about grace.  About the light of Jesus in the midst of dark sin.  According to the Bible, it's &quot;His kindness that leads us to repentance.&quot;<br />This short tale should be read by young teens (as a warning) and adults (as a ray of hope).  Although its brevity avoids some of the deeper issues involved here, &quot;Tilly&quot; gives us a much needed reminder of &quot;the peace that surpasses all understanding.&quot;	2001-11-05

As in Junger's &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; and Shackleton's &quot;Endurance,&quot; I knew the ending of this story before reading the first page.  I wondered, Should I should spend time learning the details of the disaster or go on to another book?<br />Twenty pages into the story, Philbrick's easy, yet authoritative narrative convinced me to continue.  Well-researched and never ponderous, &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; tells the tale of the whaleship Essex and the crew's struggle for survival after a sperm whale rams and sinks their vessel.  The build up to the sinking is fascinating.  With early nineteenth century details of life in Nantucket and the motivations of individual sailors, Philbrick caused me to care that much deeper as the crew set off over open ocean in hopes of survival.  The sheer immensity of the Pacific looms over the account; the crew's joint effort to prevail is incredible under the circumstances.<br />Although the dilemma of cannibalization waits till the last quarter of the book to rear its head, the emotions and lead up to that fateful--and lifesaving (for some)--decision are done with masterful care.  Philbrick justifies the crew's actions with the history of seafaring survivors.  The details are horrific, but the humanity of these men manages to shine through, in part, through Philbrick's attention to the survivors' following years and destinies.<br />With a wealth of information in the notes at the back of the book, &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; stands as a modern masterpiece, reminding us of the anguish that has helped shaped our nation, while also warning us of the dangers of abusing our natural resources.  If history is an ocean, Philbrick takes us to the heart of it.	2001-11-04

The comparison to &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; convinced me to give it a shot.  The fact that Guy Burt wrote this when he was merely eighteen adds a bit of morbid fascination to this sinister and twisting tale.<br />Now let's get this straight...this book never reaches the status of &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot;  Where the classic book of human depravity painted a broad picture, &quot;The Hole&quot; paints a focused and limited picture.  I don't believe the author attempts to make huge social statements, but I do believe he sets out to unsettle us.  And he succeeds.<br />The story revolves around five friends who agree to be locked for three days in a forgotten hole, a sunken room of a British school.  The sixth friend is supposed to come and release them after this &quot;experiment with real life.&quot;  What they don't realize is that the sixth friend has no such intention.  In fact, he intends for them to face the brutal horror of survival.  As the reader, we don't understand all the reasonings at first, but we do sense a creeping, claustrophobic doom.  We wait for something horrible to happen.  Here's the clincher, though...<br />The book's premise appears to promise more than it can deliver.  Even in the last chapter, I wondered if I'd missed something.  After following first and third person accounts and tape-recorded accounts, I wondered if the mental gymnastics were worth the final payoff.  Then, with my interest still firmly intact, I read the epilogue.  Ahh, yes...it was worth it.  There's more here than meets the eye.  The author, in his focused and limited picture, paints vividly.  Only as we step away from &quot;The Hole&quot; do we realize how truly awful the painting is.  The author only hints at most of the dark doings, thus succeeding in releasing the horrors of our own thoughts.<br />As I filled in the details from my own imagination, I realized that &quot;The Hole&quot; does succeed in showing the dark side of humanity.  It does so, in part, by allowing us to dredge it up ourselves.<br />Now that's some good writing.e dark side of humanity.

The voice of the characters came vividly to life.  The story's background, complete with historical tidbits and Morgan's family folklore mixed in, make &quot;This Rock&quot; a tale of pathos and wisdom.<br />Is &quot;This Rock&quot; a sequel to &quot;Gap Creek&quot;?  Yes and no.  &quot;Gap Creek&quot; is one of those books that stuck with me.  I cared about the characters of Hank and Julie and their plight.  Yes, &quot;This Rock&quot; does interweave bits and pieces of Hank and Julie's lives with the story of new characters.  What a pleasant surprise to run across these treasured fictional friends, to see where life has taken them.  But, no, this book does not serve strictly as a sequel.  For the most part, it's not as dramatically depressing either--though it does have a few painful moments.<br />&quot;This Rock&quot; stands solidly alone, an ode to the people who have built this great country--and some of those who have corrupted it, whether bootleggers or religious bigots.  Using the dual viewpoints of young Muir and his mother Ginny, the story recounts the troubles of a family in the first half of the twentieth century.  Ginny is a widow, raising three kids.  Her view sheds light on the emotional struggle of a mother hoping for the best for her children.  Muir's view is self-centered and driven, although it begins to taper as life humbles him.<br />Young Muir's dream is to be a preacher.  His brother Moody has no real aspirations, save to sneak out and bootleg with the local ruffians.  Both brothers make choices that will have negative consequences, but, in the author's soulful and honest manner, the book manages to bring the light of redemption through the darkness.  &quot;This Rock&quot; moves slowly on the surface, while underneath the struggles of the human heart churn and race. I found myself pulled downstream, caught up in the story, hoping that Muir would achieve his dream and that Moody would find rest for his soul.<br />Robert Morgan caps off his story with events that are both predictable and surprising.  As in &quot;Gap Creek,&quot; he offers hope at the end of the day--a hope that is formed from the fires of hard work and deep pain.  While other writers tend to throw out shallow promises, Morgan's writing and his characters deliver something richer and much more rewarding.<br />&quot;This Rock&quot; is worth holding onto.that Muir would achieve his dream and that Moody would find rest for his soul.<br />Robert Morgan caps off his story with events that are both predictable and surprising.

She nevers dumbs down her language or ideas for a younger audience.  She treats readers with respect and intelligence, so much so that I, as an adult, find her books incredibly fascinating and thought-provoking.<br />&quot;The Wind in the Door&quot; is as good as its predecessor &quot;A Wrinkle in Time.&quot;  Although connected, this book can be read alone.  The people and creatures are both loveable and loathsome.  Meg's character is great, and her family is just quirky enough that we fall in love with them.  This time, it's her brother Charles Wallace who is in grave danger.  Only as Meg and others enter his body as miniscule entities can they fight the enemies that threaten to kill him.  We discover that Echthroi are fallen angels/demons, intent on destroying the universe, and we also find a cherubim named Proginoskes who is there to help Meg and her friend Calvin in the spiritual battle.<br />Mixing elements of &quot;The Fantastic Voyage&quot; and &quot;Innerspace&quot; with elements of &quot;This Present Darkness,&quot; L'Engle gives us a story that somehow has application in myriad ways.  It's a story of spiritual deliverance, of math and time debates, of character maturity, even of a young girl learning to love her unloveable school principle.  All this in 203 pages.<br />This is one of the best bargains going.  No wonder these books are still around after thirty years; &quot;The Time Quartet&quot; stands the test of time.	2001-10-19

In &quot;Ava's Man,&quot; we get to meet Charlie Bundrum, Rick Bragg's grandfather.  Charlie died a year before Bragg was born, so Bragg retells the story through the accounts of relatives and friends.  The result is worth every page.<br />Bragg, in his gritty and poignant manner, depicts life during the Depression with power and grace--and an armload of humor.  I found myself laughing out loud at times, then wiping tears from my eyes a moment later.  That's the sort of writer Rick Bragg is.  While lending his characters dignity and respect, Bragg manages to show them with warts and all.  You'll meet unforgettable characters, such as Hootie (the lonely man Charlie took into his home for over two decades), and Bob (the horse that gingerly deposited drunken Charlie at his doorstep).  You'll discover murder and moonshine, family loyalty and love, and even glimpses of something divine.<br />Bragg manages to give us a story equally as engaging as his incredible &quot;All Over but the Shoutin'.&quot;  I'm not much of a drinker.  But I am a big reader.  If &quot;Ava's Man&quot; was moonshine, I'd be arrested for bootleggin' cause this is irresistible stuff.	2001-10-18

With attention to detail (sometimes to the extreme), Lawhead makes us smell and taste and hear the tangibles of worlds far removed from us.  And, usually, he makes us aware of the intangibles.  Though his characters can seem stiff at times, they reflect eras gone by, and sometimes suprise us with their poignant insights and honor.<br />I am a huge fan of &quot;The Iron Lance.&quot;  In the first book of this series, Lawhead gave us a character in Murdo that we could relate to--he struggled with his faith, with his quest, and with his own weaknesses.  In &quot;The Black Rood&quot; and &quot;The Mystic Rose,&quot; we find characters who never struggle in the way Murdo did.  For this reason, they never drew me into the story the same way.<br />Don't get me wrong, Cait's character in &quot;The Mystic Rose&quot; is worthy of her forbears.  She is strong and ready for the task ahead.  After witnessing her father's murder, she decides to seek revenge against the Templar commander responsible.  Inadvertently, she ends up with a letter that is key to the location of the Holy Grail, the Mystic Rose.  As she sets out to find this treasure, in hopes of luring her father's killer, we are exposed to places rich in color and scenery.  Unfortunately, some of this seems staged.  Lawhead leads us to believe that a certain Arab prince is up to no good, but later we find ourselves slightly deceived by this.  We also see the Templar commander begin to track Cait, but this subplot tapers off until his sudden appearance at the end.  We suspect that this will happen, so it's no big surprise; the only surprise is that we're given no explanation of how he found the Mystic Rose's location.<br />One subplot that other reviewers have been quick to rail against, the early 1900's connection, I personally enjoyed throughout the series.  It brought the historic existence of these holy relics into this century, whetting my appetite for the real treasure of the Swift Sure Hand that Lawhead writes of.  In &quot;The Mystic Rose,&quot; more than the first two books of The Celtic Crusades, Lawhead points us in a spiritual direction full of hope and grace.  In so doing, he adds value for those who believe--and possibly undermines the effort for those who do not.<br />I believe.  I enjoyed the series.

Within the first twenty pages I was caught in Silva's deceptively easygoing rhythm of writing.  With thinly sliced scenes and sparsely evocative description, I soon felt I knew the people and places of which he writes.<br />&quot;The Kill Artist&quot; refers to Gabriel Allon, a former Israeli agent who has retreated to his world of art restoration.  He is drawn back into service to track down a Palestinian terrorist named Tariq.  With the help of a French/Jewish model and a handful of others, Gabriel must not only outwit his opponent, he must also battle his own guilt and demons of the past.  With memorable characters such as Shamron, the Israeli secret service head, and Isherwood, the beleagured art collector, Silva draws us into a world of suspense and emotion.  The motivations of Gabriel, &quot;The Kill Artist,&quot; are believable.  As are those of Tariq, the terrorist.  The showdown between the two is worth every page.<br />I've long been a Ludlum and Le Carre fan.  Where Ludlum seems melodramatic and over-the-top, where Le Carre seems cryptic and obtuse, Silva manages to mix tight plotting and action with thoughtful insights and characterisations.  I couldn't have found a better new author.  I've already purchased two of his other books.	2001-10-10

These aren't cerebral facts, these are life-altering, heart-changing ideas.  These are words to fuel a revolution.<br />Essentially, in his simple and loving manner, Nouwen tells us that we've got it all wrong and that we need to get back to the basics.  &quot;Much Christian leadership is exercised by people who do not know how to develop healthy, intimate relationships and have opted for power and control instead.&quot;  This quote by Nouwen not only hits the nail on the head, it pinpoints the problem of serving God in an official capacity.  Many have insulated themselves from relationships, often under the impression that they must show only their good side as a minister of the gospel; thus they wrestle alone with the sins of the flesh.<br />This short book attempts to refocus leaders' eyes on the basics...and the basics, as viewed here in poignant and startling clarity, take a lifetime to learn.  Nouwen manages to make this all seem not only possible, but desirable.  Not only helpful, but necessary.  Each time my mind began to get in the way, his words brought me back to the responses of the heart.<br />To start and finish this book, Nouwen tells us about his mentally-handicapped friend Bill.  By tucking his message between the very real love and efforts of his own life, Nouwen punctuates his words and shows us that they can, indeed, impact our own lives.<br />Even if it takes me 81 years to get it all figured out.	2001-10-10

Within two hours of opening the cover, I'd finished reading.  I've read other Bill Myers' books and, although I've appreciated his creativity, I've sometimes questioning his ability to write with more heart and richer narrative.  Here, Mr. Myers proves me wrong.<br />This book is well-written, without being overwritten.  The story follows Paul Newcombe, a pastor, who discovers that his teenage daughter has cancer.  Ally begins to pull away from her parents and from God.  Only her grandfather seems to be able to reach her--but he has troubles of his own.  The story follows the ups and downs of this family in crisis and refuses to throw out quick and easy answers.  With simple poignancy, Bill Myers brings his characters back to reality every time I thought it might get sappy.<br />For everyone who has struggled with death and illness, this book hits a nerve.  For those who wrestle with God over heartfelt issues, this novella strikes a bittersweet chord.  Bill Myers shows what it is to truly come to terms with God despite the questions and heartache around us.  While staying safely within the boundaries of Christian fiction etiquette, he manages to show the true frustration and pain that resides in the human heart.<br />Borrowing from the mold of Nicholas Sparks, Myers focuses instead on the love relationship between man and God.  Can our faith survive until death?  Myers gives a thoughtful and satisfying answer.  These are questions worth asking...and &quot;When the Last Leaf Falls&quot; provides answers worth responding to.	2001-10-01

The characters dealt with real emotions in real ways, and the Christian elements didn't seem forced.<br />In &quot;The Nephilim Seed,&quot; although Bell takes a while to unveil the intents of the villian, he creates passable suspense, particularly through the eyes of a young kidnapped girl.  Her simple faith is, for the most part, believable.  Her mother's casual reliance on prayer is less credible.  As a father of two girls, it was difficult for me to believe her response.  In particular, she puts little pressure on the authorities to find her daughter; in fact, the police are almost entirely missing from that element of the story.  Every time the mother thinks about her missing daughter (not as often as you might suppose), a quick prayer seems to ease her fears.<br />Unfortunately, Bell's books are becoming increasingly pedantic even as they continue to explore broader ideas.  As always, he comes up with an intriguing enough plot.  Here, he deals with the issue of the &quot;God Spot&quot; in the brain, and whether it's a true desire for God, or an evolutionary result of our need for comfort.  His characters and dialogue are fairly believable.  This time, though, he makes sure to let us know his Christian viewpoints within the first few pages.<br />James Scott Bell can write well.  He has the ability to put me on the edge of my seat.  He's capable of making spiritual points.  Since he deals with sometimes violent situations in his fiction, perhaps his publishers and/or readers have asked him to infuse his books with more straightforward spiritual statements.  This might please the general audience of Christian fiction, but there really are many of us out here who want a story that deals with tough issues head-on while refusing to whitewash the difficulties.  Bell gives a decent story here, but fails to deal with the true problems he presents.  Instead, he trusts cliches and knee-jerk Christian sayings to settle the characters' struggles.<br />I'll still look for his books, but I hope he goes back to the nitty-gritty.  John Grisham displayed that element in &quot;The Testament.&quot;  T. Davis Bunn did so in &quot;The Great Divide.&quot;  I believe James Scott Bell can do the same again--as long as he doesn't worry about the rumblings of dissent from the choir.

Time-travel and wormholes, Jerusalem and an attempt to assassinate the Apostle Paul? Great concepts, but could this new author pull it off?<br />Ingermanson not only pulls it off, he tells a story worth re-reading. I was impressed. &quot;Transgression&quot; works as a historical/futuristic suspense novel--and, on top of that, offers theological insights. This story of Rivka, an archeaology student, and Avi, a physicist, is suspenseful and taut. The dialogue is crisp, with subtle depth and honesty. As his characters took form early on, I was intrigued by their religious differences and wondered how they would interact once they time-traveled back to A.D. 57. Not only are they challenged by one another, they are confronted with a world of varying customs and traditions. In their quest to save the Apostle Paul from a modern scientist with a madcap scheme, they encounter various minor characters, all of whom are depicted with depth and grace.  With numerous little details, Ingermanson builds a credible view of first century Jerusalem and I found myself wanting to visit, wanting to check some of the incidents described against the history of the New Testament.<br />To round off an entertaining and thought-provoking novel, Ingermanson also throws in a few doses of romance. Some of it worked for me, some of it seemed sudden and/or stilted. But give him credit for mixing in a little spice to this already flavorful book. Better quality publishing might've helped this book out (I personally found the graphics and cover a bit substandard), but the author managed to override my qualms with solid storytelling. I'm looking forward to reading his newest, titled &quot;Oxygen.&quot;	2001-09-24

Buckley, Jr.  I've particularly enjoyed his Blackford Oakes espionage novels.  He writes with dry wit, subtle satire, and entertaining characters.  I was intrigued to discover he'd penned an &quot;Autobiography of Faith.&quot;  Although I was born Catholic, I was not raised Catholic.  Nonetheless, I've appreciated many of the Catholic tenets and approached our differences with an open heart and mind.<br />With this in mind, I cracked the pages of &quot;Nearer, My God.&quot;  Buckley starts off with his early years and paves the way to understanding his background.  I have no question of his deep belief and honest relationship with God.  Unfortunately, he deviates from the autobiographical approach and turns the spotlight on theological and moral arguments regarding Catholicism.  In a further departure form the autobiography indicated on the cover, Buckley leans heavily on the opinions and debates of others.  I did enjoy the perspectives brought to the table.  Some were eye-opening, others enlightening, a few disturbing.<br />What about Buckley's own journey of faith, though?  He seems to have grown up with a set of views that he rarely stepped away from.  I admire that.  But instead of seeing a heartfelt struggle with God, I found within these pages a striving to validate that which he's always believed.  For his benefit?  For ours?  Either way, the book did not live up to its promise.  I can recommend it for the interesting viewpoints and debates expressed by Buckley's peers and forebears.  I cannot recommend it as an &quot;Autobiography of Faith.&quot;  For satisfaction along those lines, I'd turn to Anne Lamott, Kathleen Norris, even the Pope's lucid books.  I wanted to know the heart behind Buckley's mind.  I didn't find it here.	2001-09-10

I was swept away by her emotional and physical struggles on a prehistoric tableau that resembled our own in so many ways. The conflicts of the first Earth's Children book were real and heart-wrenching.<br />With the announcement of Jean M. Auel's upcoming fifth book, I decided it was time to catch up on this bestselling series. &quot;The Valley of Horses&quot; quickly took me back to Ayla's struggles. Jean Auel does a great job of integrating the facts of the first book without seeming forced. Although her writing becomes overwrought at times, I'm still amazed at the manner in which her narrative sweeps me into a different time and place. I'm also amazed at her ability to capture human emotions in a realistic manner, while introducing cultural and time-oriented contrasts that always seem credible. She creates another world with utter believability. <br />She also relies on romance to keep this book going. Okay, I appreciate the historic significance of Ayla's and Jondalar's meeting and consummation. I wanted it to happen as much as the next guy--or should I say girl? I'm a romantic at heart, but these two seem just a little too physically perfect at times. Ayla and Jondalar are likeable and memorable. I don't need to know every physical detail of their anatomies and couplings to like them more than I do.<br />With that complaint aside, I enjoyed the relationships Ayla builds with the animals, and I admired Auel's ability to make the Mamutoi and Sharamudoi Caves come alive with their own history and civilization. I'm looking forward to &quot;The Mammoth Hunters,&quot; hoping to discover a little more adventure than romance.	2001-09-10

In fact, before seeing the cover, I thought perhaps Randy was delving into the Christian romance market.<br />That all changed when I saw the Chinese writing on the dust jacket. Having travelled in China, smuggling Bibles and sharing my faith, I was intrigued. Then, I peeled back the jacket to discover the amazing picture of a Chinese believer held in Jesus' arms. Standing there in the bookstore, I was hit with emotion, with moisture in my eyes. Suddenly, the title &quot;Safely Home&quot; made sense.  The persecution of the Chinese church is real, and Alcorn shows clearly the difference between the state church and the underground church.  I've met some of these underground believers.  Alcorn captures their heart for God in ways that I've never seen in fiction before.  He captures much of the Chinese believers' humility and struggle in this heartfelt novel.<br />The contrast between two former college friends, one a Chinese doctor, the other an American businessman, is credible and lends itself perfectly to the contrast in their levels of faith. Through the looking glass of this story, Alcorn forces us to weigh our own faith. Do we know what it means to stand for our beliefs? Do we know what it means to pay a price for our integrity?<br />Although Alcorn can come across as preachy at times, he always has something worth saying. By mixing a fascinating cultural and spiritual struggle in a fictional form, he opens our hearts to hear the truth...The response is up to us.	2001-09-10

Finally I nailed it down and started to read.  Within minutes I was laughing at the sharp dialogue and shaking my head at the author's powerful abilities.  As an admirer of James Lee Burke's writing, I saw similarities in characterization and dialogue.  Is Burke a Dashiell Hammett fan?  I don't know.  Yes, Hammett's characters are written with wit, style, and depth.  But his plotting surpasses Burke's lumbering, let's-see-where-the-day-leads-us style.  This story begins to twist and backtrack every time you think you know where it's headed.  The ultimate prize, the Maltese Falcon, has secrets of its own.<br />Although a bit surprised at certain vulgarities and immoral situations within the story (surprising due to the period in which it was written), I couldn't help but admire Hammett's inimitable style.  This is tight and well-paced writing.  This is a story that carries all the charm of an old-fashioned movie while seeming absolutely modern in its sensibilities and understanding of human nature.  The ending is satisfactory, with a surprise or two, but also leaves a few issues unresolved so that the reader must fill in the gaps from the information given.<br />I found myself smiling.  I'd been in the hands of a master storyteller.  And, in keeping with Hammett's sometimes rough manner, I wondered just where did the term &quot;Give 'em the bird&quot; come from?  Could it have come from this nifty little mystery.  It would certainly fit.  Read it and you'll know what I mean.	2001-09-06

I thought he'd found his niche with &quot;The Great Divide&quot; (his legal thriller), but this book of political and financial intrigue raises the standard even higher.  I'm not a big stocks and funds enthusiast, but Bunn manages to create a suspenseful and well-researched plot that hooked me early on.  He works in a credible idea of dealing with Third World debt that I particularly found interesting. Beyond his obvious knowledge of the subject, Bunn creates believable characters and writes with a narrative flair that I personally love.  His story is complex and maybe too intertwined for some to delve into, but I couldn't get enough.<br />As the title of this review suggests, I did lose sleep finishing this book.  But the title is stolen from Bunn's own writing.  &quot;Jackie's eyelids felt coated with shards from the hourglass of lost sleep.&quot;  It's writing such as this, passionate and imaginative, that make the political and financial arena come alive.  Jackie and Wynn, the two protaganists, are complex characters whom I came to care for.  Although the spiritual lessons are muted and few, Bunn works in heartfelt and very real spiritual thoughts without seeming preachy.<br />With a recent batch of superlative novels by Christian authors(&quot;When Heaven Weeps&quot; by Ted Dekker and &quot;The List&quot; by Robert Whitlow, to name a few), I must include &quot;Drummer in the Dark&quot; as one of my favorites.	2001-08-21

The upcoming publication of Auel's fifth book has renewed my interest in the EarthChildren series. I'm now re-reading the books and reviewing the first, which I originally read almost 18 years ago. Am I allowed to reminisce like this? Am I out of bounds? Well, don't try to stop me. This book is still clear in my mind after nearly two decades. In the early 80's, I thumbed through it at an Albertson's checkout line, finished the first chapter, and told my parents about it. I received it a week later for my birthday...and loved every minute of the story. Jean Auel's narrative powers swept me into a past rich and alive with people, creatures, smells, and sights that are immediately familiar, yet breathtakingly foreign. That's what first caught my attention. Then I began to care about Ayla, the skinny, pale child caught in an earthquake. I followed her story with keen interest and ached over her insecurities and alienation. This is a story about people with all the feelings and emotions of you and me. And though some tried to ban the book for one particular scene of forced sex, I found it in no way glorifying the act. In fact, as a teenager, it made me more aware of a female's struggle in a male-dominated society. I'll never forget the experience--indeed, that's what it was!--of reading this novel. To go back and relive the story of Ayla all over again is a treat. I can't wait for &quot;The Shelters of Stone.&quot; Only rarely does an author create a world so rich and believable that we could almost call it home.	2001-08-21

I'd rate it 3 1/2 stars if I could.  Bell's use of first person never reaches the level of Lawrence Block, whom he admits to emulating to some extent.  Block's humor is sharp and dry, whereas Bell's seems semi-sharp and semi-dry--at least in this story.  The lawyer, Mr. Denney, is the stereotypical hard-drinking lawyer, fighting his inner demons.  I've read enough legal thrillers to have tired of this character.  Nonetheless, by the end of the story, Bell gives Denney depth and creates sympathy and...I found myself caring.<br />The story revolves around Howie Patino, a simple-minded man and former schoolmate of Denney's.  Howie is charged with the brutal murder of his wife and Denney comes to his aid.  Along the way, Denney struggles with his belief, or lack of belief, in God, and his burgeoning feelings for Howie's sister.  Many potential conflicts are presented.  Not all of them are carried out, but at least the book doesn't present all easy answers.  Denney's struggle of faith is credible and I found myself warming to the story even as it ended.<br />Bell has a great ear for dialogue, and manages to make me laugh on occasion.  I'll keep reading his work, and hope that this is not a departure from the finer qualities I enjoyed in &quot;Final Witness.&quot;  Just my opinion, but there it is.	2001-08-15

I enjoyed the music in the background and the expressive voices.  Gollum's representation was particularly outstanding, capturing the emotion and struggle of his character.  Overall, this CD set was worth the purchase: great packaging and liner notes, nice production.  The only complaint is that it does not fill in many of the gaps for those who've not yet read the series.  I intended to introduce my kids to Tolkien via this CD set, but I fear they would miss much of the flavor of his Middle Earth narrative, not to mention the details of a number of climactic scenes.  I loved reading the books, and listening to them was like reminiscing around the campfire about shared experiences...but if you haven't read the books, these campfire tales might leave you feeling a bit left out.	2001-08-10

(with a few glitches)	I enjoyed Dekker's first book, but felt he was pushing a little, still stretching his wings.  Boy, this book takes flight and never comes down.  Dekker tells a gripping story and peoples it with characters we love or hate.  On top of the captivating tale, he manages to weave in a powerful symbol of God's love and sacrifice for His Bride, the Church.  Usually, this type of symbolism becomes heavy-handed and overpowers the use of a real plot and believable dialogue.  Here, Dekker pulls it all off with masterful ease and entertains us just long enough for us to let our guard down...then he slams his point home.  I've read few novels this well-written.<br />Some minor glitches: one character pulls on Nikes years before they were developed (I grew up in Eugene, OR...I should know).  Big deal, right?  But it did remind me it was all a story right in the middle of getting hooked.  Dekker also loves to say &quot;spiked.&quot;  As in &quot;his heart spiked.&quot;  This started to jump out at me after a while.  Last complaint...my copy was missing pages 313-344!  A printing error, I guess.  And right in the middle of the last quarter of the book...aggh.  Once I found a complete book, I was greatly relieved.<br />Don't miss this book.  Don't miss this author's writing.  And don't miss the point.  &quot;When Heaven Weeps&quot; it's because God loves His people and will do whatever it takes to prove that love.  Ted Dekker does his best to weave a beautiful and suspenseful tale.  I'll have to read this one again.	2001-08-10

The theme of this book caught my attention and, in many ways, lived up to its promise.  The chess and real life dramas are woven smoothly, and the chess strategy and reasoning made sense (with one or two moments of artistic license).  The opening intrigued me, the middle game complicated matters, and the endgame brought things to a tidy conclusion.<br />I couldn't help but wonder if I was missing some of the writer's heart in the translation.  The characters are expertly crafted, but lacked heart and connection with me.  Although I enjoyed the moves of the deadly game, I had little feeling for those that give their lives in the course of the chess maneuvering.  The language, while tight and European-sounding, seemed to be a bit generic at points.<br />Overall, the threads of the mystery draw tighter and tighter and the author leaves a few surprises for the reader.  Some may find intrigue in the chess aspects or the art aspects...I found myself primarly drawn into the strategizing of the villain and those trying to unmask the villain's identity.  The suspense was based on the unfolding strategy, such as in a game of chess.  And I was captured.  Check and mate.	2001-07-30

If you want fiction that presents clear-cut sides, black and white, then avoid John Marco's books.  This writer refuses to box his characters in--good or bad--and for that I applaud him.  Following the story of young Prince Richius is a rambling, sometimes frustrating affair.  He doesn't follow the tidy rules of fantasy fiction.  Neither do his enemies.  If you think you know who's who and what sides everyone stands on, just wait till you reach the end.<br />Despite the mixed reviews here, I ventured forth into the first hundred pages of this book.  I kept my expectations low and found myself on page 184 before I knew it.  No, it doesn't blow your socks off, but the writing moves smoothly and the plot drew me in.  Nearly 600 hundred pages later, having completed the book, I can't say I'm disappointed.  Sure, some aspects of the characters may grind at you (some of their idiosyncracies and idiocies), but isn't that life?<br />The military scenes are believable, sometimes riveting and/or teeth-shattering; and the romantic aspects of the story are only as clumsy as Richius' personality.  Personally, I loved the book and look forward to reading the next.  The lands of Nar and Lucel-Lor are distinctly reminiscent of our own environs, though with occasional surprises.  The fact that the landscape seemed so simply believable to me is a testament to Marco's easygoing style and subtle complexity.  I feel like I know his land and his characters, and yet I could read plenty more without growing bored.<br />I'm glad I scratched the surface...I see gold beneath the clay.  (And, for those who've read it, do you think the Lorris and Pris statue will come into play in the next book?)  I'm intrigued.  I'm hooked.	2001-06-24

After walking part of the Pacific Crest Trail two weeks ago, I decided to read through Bryson's Appalachian Trail experiences.  A number of things jumped out at me: 1) the relatively low elevation of the AT, 2) the considerably whining on his and particularly his partner's parts, 3) Bryson's tendency to pontificate on environmental issues, and 4) his fantastic sense of humor and readability.<br />To expound, I must say that the low elevation is somewhat relative, considering the steep grade of some of the AT's trails.  I'd love to try the hike someday.<br />The whining makes Bryson and Katz (his partner) seem like the middle-aged men that they are and, though sometimes highlighting their inexperience, makes them seem like entertaining trailmates.  It also makes Bryson seem very down-to-earth and approachable--like we could join him for lunch and have a great chat.  Sure, he might go into great detail about the Forest Service's mismanagement of funds and nature--and I would heartily agree--but he would be equally willing to discuss other issues (for example, those annoying hikers who must flash their namebrands like climbing qualifications).<br />I certainly agreed with most of Bryson's environmental gripes, and he informed me of certain facts I was previously unaware of, but I didn't really pick up this book for 3 and 4 page ramblings on such issues, and this was a minor irritation to me.  A personal gripe, nothing more.  Hey, at least somebody's trying to open our country's capitalistic eyes!<br />Finally, this book is just flat-out hilarious at points.  I drove my wife crazy demanding that she listen to 'just this one more part.'  She did laugh, quite hard a number of times, but I could see that look in her eye when I'd asked just one too many times.  Bryson's a witty and intelligent writer, and I'm already searching for his next book.	2001-06-22

Switching from historically based stories (&quot;The Gray Champion&quot; and &quot;Endicott and the Red Cross&quot;) to spiritual allegories (&quot;The Bosom Serpent&quot; and &quot;The Celestial Railroad&quot;), Hawthorne continually chips away at the danger of isolation.  Although he clearly believed in the fallibility and evil of the human heart--particularly pointing out the religious hypocrites--he also believed that one must continue to risk and be a part of the community.  In stories such as &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot; and &quot;Wakefield&quot;, we see the gloom that comes over certain men who pull away.<br />Hawthorne, like Poe, uses graphic and surreal imagery, sometimes repetitively, to set a mood and draw a picture.  His characters and scenes are alive and psychological consistent with his tales, and he manages to wring a moral out of nearly every page.<br />Heavy-handed?  Yes, but he aims to state a message, and he states it clearly: The moral nature must never be sacrificed for intellectual pursuits (Ethan Brand).  In a world of cheap commercialism and mindless brain fodder, at least Hawthorne has something to say.	2001-06-09

That got my attention.  I hoped to relive the intimate conversations with believers behind the Iron Curtain; I hoped to taste and smell and visualize the rugged and beautiful countryside.  I was mildly disappointed.<br />Bambola's novel is a tale of two brothers separated by time and geography, brought together again as adults in Romania--one an American ambassador, one a Romanian colonel.  The cover and description of &quot;Refiner's Fire&quot; led me to believe this would be more male-oriented fiction.  It's not.  That's not to say that it's a waste of time for  male readers; in fact, I appreciated the story and the lessons to be learned.  The writing is easy and flowing.  The dialogue is generally snappy.  I felt that the plot and characters, although fitting, were geared toward a female reader.  A number of times, I found the ambassador's reactions to his wife a bit syrupy and/or emotional for a man of his position.<br />The book reads quickly, and the wake-up call to a lazy American society is needed (particularly within the churches).  Bambola does give us some heart-rending facts regarding the persecution others face.  Unfortunately for me, though, I never felt like I was taken back to the places or peoples I visited.  For those who have never been there, this might be a great introduction.	2001-06-08

Now, as a father of two daughters, I decided to preview this novel for them.  Wow!  L'Engle uses wild flights of imagination and early stabs at quantum physics to deliver an entertaining and wonderful story. I've heard some complain of New Age thinking in this story, but no, this is Christian theory with an ability to think outside the box (are Christians allowed to do that? L'Engle says yes!).<br />&quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; follows a girl struggling with low self-worth and family issues and watches her mature as she discovers the truth and power required to resist evil.  The evil, aptly titled IT, tries to make everyone alike, robbing them of creativity and individuality.  Meg, the young girl, realizes that the very things that make her stand out in a crowd are also the things that make her special.  By risking her own self for her younger brother, she becomes a young woman and watches her family reunite as a result.<br />This story has memorable characters (Aunt Beast, Mrs. Whatsit, the Man with the Red Eyes) and fanciful settings, but it tells a dark and sombre tale.  Through occasional splices of humor, warmth, and scripture recitation, all's well that ends well...and I'm ready to find another wrinkle in time.	2001-06-01

Four stars is somewhat lenient, but...I still enjoyed it.<br />After receiving a promotional e-mail, I bought the book to support a fellow writer (although he's a stranger to me), and was struck first by the numerous editorial flaws.  This left me with a sour taste regarding ...  Also, a good editor could've tightened the narrative and turned it into a riveting tale.  Instead, I was distracted by overwrought adjective usage and occasional sidetracks.<br />Now, let me tell you why I still give this four stars.  \\"St. Jude's Secret\\" has heart and soul.  This book, while not as seamless as a Grisham tale, has feeling.  Jones shows true care and concern for his characters--something Grisham's \\"The Brethren\\" absolutely lacked.  And, despite the sometimes ponderous description, Jones cooks up some true gems amid the coal.  Some of his sentences and scenes positively gleam with magical appeal.<br />I'd love to see Jones hook up with the right editor who could polish his abilities and create a book that sparkles throughout.  This book does not do so, but it entertains and occasionally enthralls--and it never fails to have heart and soul.  If you can look past all the typos, you'll be glad you took the chance on this.  I certainly was.	2001-05-27

Gansky's books provide a variety of flavors--action, mystery, supernatural elements, even attempts at hinted romance--and are sure to have something for just about everyone.<br />In this, the fourth of Gansky's novels I've read (&quot;A Ship Possessed&quot; is still my favorite), the story centers around a young boy with supernatural abilities to see people's pain, emotional and physical, and to bring healing.  Young Toby is a prodigy of sorts, sought after by the money-hungry and the disease-stricken.  His mother is a simple, but honest woman, caught up in the flurry of activity around her son.  Thomas York, a seminary student searching for truth in his relationship with God, meets up with Toby, awed by the supernatural power.<br />These characters have elements worth caring about, but Toby's basic invincibility and the criminals' basic stupidity (you know, the ones that always talk instead of shooting the hero) made it difficult for me to feel genuine concern for their well-being.  Also, the radio-talk-show-host-turned-cult-leader was a bit of a stretch for me.  That said, I think Gansky deftly handles some scenes, particularly a harrowing battle for survival in the ocean. He serves up a buffet and I closed the final pages feeling as though I'd been fed and generally satisfied.  The message of seeking after a relationship with God over miracles was well-made without discounting God's power.<br />I read many books, particularly thrillers.  Only on occasion do I get to enjoy the delectable home-made feasts of a Frank Peretti, John LeCarre, or James Lee Burke.  Though this doesn't reach that level, it does make an entertaining and thought-provoking read.  As long as Gansky keeps serving them up, I'll keep going through the line.	2001-05-26

Not only does it come from those who have been there, it comes with true affection and respect for those who are on their way.	2001-05-22

Randy Alcorn writes fiction with more lessons than a month of Sunday sermons.  Although bordering on preachiness at times, he manages to work the lessons in around a detailed and believable plot, thus allowing us to swallow the medicine he delivers. Through the eyes of a black reporter in Portland, OR, Alcorn tells a mystery revolving around the murder of one of the reporter's relatives.  The story, though heavy and thought-provoking, gives glimpses of hope and the rewards of the hereafter.<br />In &quot;Dominion,&quot; Alcorn tackles racism head on.  I, like the characters in the book, live in Oregon, but Alcorn really opened my eyes to the reality of this issue still present in our society.  He doesn't retreat from the tough questions, he faces them with wisdom and courage.  He refuses to whitewash the skin issue; instead, he shows us that love does see color, and learns to appreciate others for their differences.  By acting color blind, we only reveal our deep-seeded prejudice and miss out on the beauty of God's colorful creation.<br />Alcorn's writing is tight and well-characterized.  In particular, his ghetto and gang scenes are effective without resorting to profanity.  The book is long, but worth the effort.  The rewards are there in every way, and the story will linger in your mind for a long time.<br />A mystery?  Yes.  A treatise on respect for all races?  Yes.  A great read?  Yes.  Alcorn, again, delivers with tough and timely storytelling.	2001-05-22

L'Engle does something here that few devotional authors dare.  She not only supplies answers and inspirations, she poses questions.  Questions without easy answers.  Questions that penetrate to the heart of true faith in God.<br />Does she qualify as a mystic?  Yes, in that she moves outside the world of pure rationalism.<br />Is she a Christian?  Yes, in the sense that she believes upon Jesus Christ as the savior and as the only begotten Son of God.<br />Is she an agnostic?  Yes, by her own definition.  She says that by confessing agnosticism, she is only confessing that she doesn't know everything.  She refuses to lie or pretend otherwise.  Yet, in the midst of not knowing, she still believes in the God that created the universe.<br />This devotional breathes life into a sometimes stale genre.  L'Engle's openness might challenge, even offend, some.  But for those on the limits of faith, those hanging in amidst life's tragedies and unexpected miracles, &quot;Glimpses of Grace&quot; gives a little more grace to move on.  This is classic and poignant writing. One closes the pages filled with a greater awe and greater mystery regarding the love of God.	2001-05-10

Phillips has stirred my heart for this great land. His storytelling and research are superb, particularly when he lets them walk stride for stride.<br />In his first Caledonia book, Phillips swept me away...in this sequel, the research gets ahead of the story and I felt brushed along.  In &quot;Legend of the Celtic Stone,&quot; Phillips drew strong and memorable characters from Scotland's past and invited me to be a part of that history.  In &quot;An Ancient Strife,&quot; he took me to fascinating places, but the facts overwhelmed the fiction at times.<br />I enjoyed this sequel.  And I'll look for the follow up. I'm sure that Phillips has exhaustively delved into Scottish history, with laudable results--but it seems he felt bound to communicate more history than I bargained for.  Some of you historical fiction fans might desire this very thing, but I still hoped for a story to get lost in.  Instead, I felt that the book was driving itself forward on a rigid timeline, omitting scenes that the story had been building to, breaking into characters' interaction with chapters that were, more accurately, long footnotes.<br />In the notes at the back of the book, Phillips hints at scenes that the editor had him omit, and they were scenes I would've infinitely enjoyed.  Whether editor or author continued to cut out anticipated elements, I don't know, but I did feel cheated a few times.<br />If you're looking for well-researched and fascinating storytelling, Phillips still has that ability.  If you felt his first book raised the bar for the genre (as I did), don't let this one disappoint you.  I'm sure that the third will continue this great series, only this time I hope Phillips lets his fiction have room to run--it's in this capacity that he rises above the pack.	2001-05-01

He brings his world to the written page in a credible manner, fueling the plot with the intricacies of a murder trial.  The twists and turns are minor, but satisfying, and the Georgia/Tennessee settings serve as a colorful backdrops. Although the spiritual lessons come on strong and a bit pedantic, the characters (and Whitlow) breathe reality into what might usually pass as stale religious lines.  I closed the last page feeling challenged and edified by the story's morals.<br />The emotional details are the ones that occasional trip me up in his writing.  The conflicts are real, the characters believable and likeable, but the resolutions seem to come a bit too easily and/or quickly.  I do recognize the aspect of the miraculous in some of this, but, for example, I would've liked to see Mac McLain's suicidal struggles progress more consistently.  I prefer to see a bit more of what's going on in the characters' heads.  That said, Whitlow's minimalist approach does avoid becoming melodramatic or sappy.<br />Some might prefer the numerous courtroom scenes in &quot;The Trial&quot;; personally, I enjoyed the variety of &quot;The List.&quot;  The good thing is that Whitlow, like Grisham, doesn't seem satisfied with a formula.  He continues to raise the bar for Christian legal fiction, continues to try new things in the process.  I anticipate his next book, knowing I won't be disappointed.	2001-04-18

We've both read it.  We've both gone through a similar experience as Jay (though not on the same scale), having had a father who was a pastor and made some huge mistakes that cost him his ministry.  To this day, fifteen years later, his mistakes affect us and our families.<br />Does it sound like I'm whining?  I'm not.  But, then again, maybe I just needed to get that off my chest--which is exactly what Jay Bakker does in this book.<br />I was fascinated by an insider's view of what happened to the Bakkers and, though I never appreciated PTL ministries myself, it gave me some respect for what they originally started out doing.  It seems the family was unnecessarily ravaged, especially by fellow churchgoers, but my one complaint is that Jay doesn't come totally clean and admit the long-term damage some of his father's choices had.  Oh, he does to some extent, but he still seems to have a bit of that &quot;Isn't my dad the best?&quot; attitude of a child.  I love my own father, I've forgiven him, but I can't gloss over the wrongs he committed.  I never will.<br />Jay is open about his own mistakes, though.  He paints an accurate picture of the pressures and internal motivations of a child in the limelight.  I could relate to many of his frustrations with organized religion.<br />Overall, this book reads quickly, and I thought Jay's message of God's grace was powerful.  I was moved by his encounter with Jerry Falwell, the man he lays most of the blame upon.  While honestly airing his feelings, Jay shows the need for--and the freeing power of--forgiveness.  A lesson he learned from his father.<br />Jim Bakker's book is entitled, &quot;I Was Wrong.&quot;  I'd like to read it and see if he doesn't unveil more of his own faults in what went on.  But, to have raised a son through all that who still loves and follows God...that's impressive.<br />I, too, was the son of a preacher man.  I know what it takes to move on.  And, through this book, I'd say Jay does too.ugh this book, I'd say Jay does too.	2001-04-05

Strap yourself in and wait for the Final Witness to appear.<br />James Scott Bell does many of the things that Grisham does so well: tight plotting, believable motivations, crackling dialogue.  Like &quot;The Great Divide,&quot; by T. Davis Bunn, Bell reaches for the top rungs of legal thrillerdom and succeeds.  The narrative is leaner and less colorful than Bunn's, but this only allows it to race faster.<br />While working in some valid Christian themes, often based on legal examples, &quot;Final Witness&quot; tells the compelling story of Rachel Ybarra, a young paralegal working on a case against the Russian mob.  The details of the courtroom seem well-researched, and the struggles that Rachel goes through--with her alcoholic father, her boss, her FBI friends, and particularly her nemesis &quot;The Man&quot;--move credibly to a very satisfying end with a few surprises along the way.<br />Bell's other books are going to the top of my wish list.	2001-04-04

In his last thriller, however, it seemed he'd forgotten how to have fun in the process.  In this, his most daring book--in light of his previous methods of success--he shows he can have fun while subtly seasoning a story so that it lingers in your thoughts.<br />As I read, I couldn't stop comparing the book to &quot;Gap Creek&quot; and &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; two of my favorite novels.  Both deal with young characters, with hardships and bygone eras; both make strong moral and emotional statements. Paradoxically, this is where &quot;A Painted House&quot; falls somewhat short.<br />In most of Grisham's novels, you can pinpoint a theme in one sentence.  Though fast-paced and entertaining, his legal thrillers have consistently (somewhat) managed to deliver a message, a lesson, or theme.  In this book, he slows the pace a bit and gives us a strong sense of place and character, but somewhere along the way, he forgets to funnel us to a specific theme or purpose.  This isn't necessarily a flaw.  It may even point to more nuanced messages worthy of book group discussions and friendly debate.  It does, ultimately, however, keep the novel from becoming a classic.<br />So, with that weighty expectation set aside, I'll admit that I loved the story and the characters.  Though it starts slowly, it picks up speed, thrusting you into the layers of secrets that burden a seven-year old's mind.  Young Luke Chandler is likeable, a bit lazy, a dreamer and honest--when circumstances permit.  The story of one cotton-picking season introduces you to a host of people, good and bad.  Through Luke's innocent perceptions, you come to see and smell the Arkansas land.  And, most surprisingly, John Grisham makes you laugh.  I found myself chuckling, even laughing out loud a number of times.<br />This is fun reading.  Yep, it is.  And here I thought Grisham had gone and become a serious writer.  If so, he's not taking himself too seriously--and that's a good thing. My faith has been restored.sly--and that's a good thing. My faith has been restored.	2001-03-20

If you're looking for Christian fiction that delivers a message without preaching, you'll love &quot;Ezekiel's Shadow.&quot;<br />David Ryan Long subtly builds the suspense, while bringing us deeper into the tortured world of horror novelist, Ian Merchant.  Merchant, though, has had a change of heart: he wants to follow God.  This presents a problem as he begins working on his newest novel, with a deadline hanging over his head.  And that's not all that's hanging over his head! Merchant begins receiving disturbing messages that indicate his past is coming back to haunt him.  He ends up keeping an eye out vigilantly for this mysterious intruder.<br />David Ryan Long draws us into his character's world, and we relate to his struggle for something deeper in his walk with God.  Despite Merchant's decision to turn to a new life, it doesn't all come easy for him--and that makes it seem real.  Though Merchant's marriage might come across exceptionally peaceful to many readers, and his lack of courage to face his stalker head-on might seem a bit pansy-ish (at least it did to me, once or twice), I related to him and related to the steps he took to find answers.  The ending seemed a bit rushed to me and didn't totally pay out on the suspense that seemed to be building, but the pieces all fit satisfactorily.<br />I will rush to store when Long's next book comes out.  This is one author I'll be keeping an eye out for.	2001-03-18

Boy, does Anne let it all hang out here!  I love the way Anne draws us into the insanity of child-rearing, spotlighting the ugliness that rises within us, then dousing us with armloads of humor and grace.  Just enough to make it through another day.<br />My wife and I love our kids dearly, but this book made us laugh to the point of tears, thinking of some of the frustrations that we've gone through, and some of the weird things that our single friends must think we make up.  This book refuses to back from any subject, no matter how emotionally, physically, or spiritually messy.<br />If you like life in nice, palatable little doses that never make a mess, and if you like your reading the same way, you've come to the wrong place.  Anne will leave you laughing, sniffling, jerking back in shock, then leaning in for a literary hug.  This lady's good!  So is the book!  But it sure gets messy!

The Thoenes blend the two seamlessly and left me wondering where the two separated.  The characters are believable, the setting authentic, and the descriptions vivid.  But...<br />Don't even try to pick this book up if you haven't read &quot;Jerusalem Vigil.&quot; In fact, even that book is greatly enhanced by a prior reading of the Zion Covenant and Zion Chronicles, not to mention &quot;The Twilight of Courage.&quot; The number of characters can be overwhelming, if not disorienting if you're not already familiar with them.  The story jumps right in where the previous book left off, and I even considering waiting to read them all together when the series is completed, as though they were a massive Michener novel.<br />I couldn't wait, though.  I admit it.  I just had to know what happens with Rachel and Moshe, David, Lori, Daniel, etc.  By delivering the scenes of a couple days in short segments, the story flew by, and I couldn't set it down.  Once again, I'm left waiting for the follow-up, &quot;Jerusalem's Heart,&quot; this time.  I've come to love these characters and their struggle for freedom.	2001-03-18

The scenes are short, the pace is fast, and the characters breathe just enough life into the story for you to care.  I didn't care deeply about the personal aspects of the story--they, too, were somewhat fast and airy--but the theme is ably handled and vitally important.<br />Jacobsen poses heavy questions: Can the media be trusted?  Can the media be manipulated?  Can a Christian or moral person have an influence working for the media?  The answers are found, or at least explored, within this provocative novel.  With just enough facts and figures to back his premise, Clay Jacobsen uses his years of experience in the media to hammer home a strong lesson about looking through the lies.  His characters--never dumbed-down, but at times cliched--also find truth in relationships with Jesus Christ.  The author avoids religious overtones and pulpit-pounding, while still making his point clear.  I also appreciated that his villian was three-dimensional, that he was wicked without being predictable, he was delusional without having to rub his hands together and chuckle evilly.<br />For a fast-paced read that drives home some deeper points, this book is well worth it.	2001-03-08

She alone, with her understanding of his writing style, has a chance to find the semi-autobiographical clues in his latest manuscript and unveil the true killer. Set in Oregon, the story moves quietly but quickly.  Wilhelm layers the plot with surprising depth for a relatively short novel (278 pages).<br />Imagine a pleasing scene from a mountain road; imagine darkness coming over the valley; imagine shadows growing and becoming more threatening...This is Wilhelm's style here.  She draws you quickly into the scenes, then begins hinting at the troubles ahead. The plot moves smoothly, the characters interact and brood accordingly, and the conclusion draws the loose ends together in a satisfying and sleek manner.<br />This was my first Wilhelm read.  I'm tempted to pursue her other books, particularly since she is a local author.  She captures the mood and personality of Oregon well. I enjoyed her readable style.	2001-03-02

Loved it, even.<br />So why her frustration?  This novel starts slowly, falling behind the pack of suspense thoroughbreds, appearing to be out of the race before it even begins.  Dekker's writing is far from amateurish (except for the repetitive use of certain tags, such as: Stupid Street, pineapple-smiling face, and pinhead, to name those most annoying to me).  He overdescribes near the beginning, then settles into a nice pace that I hope continues into his next two contracted books in the series.<br />Around page 100 of &quot;Heaven's Wager,&quot; I thought the story was worth it, and the pace was improving.  Around page 150, this little racehorse makes a break for it.  The story of Kent Anthony's criminal activities is captivating and suspenseful, rivalling at times some of Grisham's best.  The plot was intelligent, and the spiritual aspects, though somewhat heavy-handed at the onset, blended nicely into the story as it picked up speed.<br />As the book neared the finish line, the spiritual and criminal pieces came together--with one or two minor surprises. Although it didn't quite catch the leaders in the genre of thrillers and suspense, it passed a good portion of the field for a nice showing.<br />Next time around, I might just place my bets on Ted Dekker.	2001-02-21

Clement-Davies takes us into a world of deer in conflict and manages to make us care.  I was taken by the grandeur and honor represented in the opening scenes.  The writing, though suitable for most older children, is rich in detail and character.<br />In particular, I liked the author's choice of names.  They fit characters well.  I enjoyed the blending of spiritual and more universal themes with the Prophecy regarding Rannoch.  Rannoch is the reluctant prophet/healer, and his soul-searching seemed genuine.<br />Clement-Davies does withhold a few surprises through the story.  Sgorr's secret was particularly jarring, but fitted perfectly.  A number of scenes still linger in my thoughts--Rannoch's confrontation with the wolf; Rannoch's vision in the valley mist; the meetings with the sea otter, Nurl.  This is a fun, but thoughtful story.<br />Despite my enjoyment of this book, I ran across sections that seemed forced, maybe in need of more foreshadowing.  I also found the viewpoints annoying at times.  On the same page, I was taken from the thoughts of Rannoch (the good deer) to the thoughts of Sgorr (the bad deer) to the musings of others in the herd.  This style used to be more popular, but it definitely distracts from feeling closer to any particular character.  Overall, I wanted to like the book even more than I did.<br />Clement-Davies is working on a second novel, from what I hear.  I look forward to reading it.  Perhaps it'll read a bit smoother, perhaps not.  Regardless, I know he'll hold my interest and provide a memorable reading escape.  I loved the story, flaws and all.	2001-02-12

Mehta's writing sparkles.  With a minimalist style, she manages to capture the atmosphere of the India I loved as a child.  Her verbs and adjectives are aptly picked to evoke mystery and texture.<br />While I don't agree with all the spiritual themes in the book, I thought Mehta explored ideas without pontificating.  Yes, I believe certain truths are universal (this sort of admission makes many Bible-thumpers nervous).  I believe that forgiveness, faithfulness, mercy, etc. are Godly principles that work whether you believe in Him or not.  The very fact that they still work shows a measure of His love.  Mehta brings out some of these truths eloquently.<br />The only complaint I had was that the format--short stories strung together by one narrator--made it difficult for me to deeply sympathize or relate to any one particular character.  By trying to say too many things, Mehta divided my interests and left me with a somewhat unsatisfied feeling at the conclusion.  Overall, though, her beautiful way with words made me glad I'd spent the time and effort.	2001-02-10

I approached this first fictional experience wondering if her personality and style would show through.  The answer: Yes.<br />I couldn't help but feel I was reading one of Lamott's nonfiction pieces, actually recognizing characters, quotes, and anecdotes from her own life.  This is inevitable in any fiction, I suppose, but Anne's style is so unique and strong that it was somewhat distracting to me.<br />I do intend to try another of her fictional works--I'll read anything of hers I can get my hands on.  She is poignant without being melodramatic, funny without being insulting.  I love Lamott's writing; in general, though, I think I prefer to read her real life experiences.	2001-02-08

Myers has a great way of dropping Biblical truths and themes into modern day settings.  Where other Christian fiction plows old ground with occasionally better writing, Myers throws caution to the wind and writes from his heart and his imagination.<br />In this book, Brandon and Sarah, Katherine and Eric--all characters from his previous books in the trilogy--are brought together to deal with physical and spiritual enemies.  Ranging from Turkey, to the Himalayas, to Jerusalem, the story moves along quickly.  The spiritual allegory of Christ and His bride is powerfully portrayed through Brandon and Sarah's marital difficulties, while also showing the miracle of forgiveness in real-life relationships.<br />Myers warns us at the beginning of the book that this one is essentially for preaching at the choir.  He even encourages the reader to return it to the shelf if they seek only fast-paced escapism.  With this warning in mind, I was able to speed through the story (after a ponderous first thirty pages), and reach the conclusion with many spiritual themes to contemplate.<br />Creativity and Biblical challenge seize the day; Myers continues to explore new ideas in new ways.	2001-02-08

But this?<br />&quot;Killing Time&quot; is aptly titled.  I felt I was killing time every attempt I made to read it.  Half way through, I returned it to the library.  Although I appreciated, even endorsed, Carr's concept of knowledge versus facts, I felt I was swallowing a pedantic sermonette from a bloated short story.  The writing rarely moved me with the evocative narrative of his first books; in fact, I found certain details--or lack thereof--distracting.<br />Carr is a gifted writer, particularly when he allows his characters to drive the story.  In his previous books, I walked away with strong ideas that he had communicated through a genuine story. Here, his characters are props for a concept.  An interesting concept, yes.  The framework for cardboard characters, no.	2001-02-08

Are most of these blows aimed accurately?  You betcha!  Does Kleier's fictional Messiah speak a message that lines up with the Bible?  No!<br />I was fascinated by Kleier's mammoth undertaking. He handles it with skill. His research spans numerous subjects to add credibility to this story and his religious insights are drawn from a knowledge of biblical passages. He takes on the bastions of organized religion, landing a great many punches.  (Three cheers for any author able to do this within the confines of a suspense story!)<br />Don't be fooled, though.  If you think that Jeza, Kleier's Messiah, is the fulfillment of actual biblical prophecy, you're off target.  Her message leads its believers to become independent from God--the very mistake Lucifer made and suffered for.  While crouched within many noble and courageous ideas, the foundations of this message are humanistic, proclaiming man's own goodness as the ultimate goal and savior.  The rejection of religious forms is laudable; the rejection of a relationship with God as the final goal deviates from the truths of the New Testament.<br />With that in mind, you will find that the plot and characters function effectively, and the story moves along nicely.  The short chapters help the hefty page count melt quickly away.  Although the dialogue shifts from realistic to stilted--as do some of the characters--Kleier manages to juggle a huge cast and assortment of settings without losing us along the way.<br />My hat goes off to Kleier for broaching so many taboo subjects unflinchingly, and to all those who are offended by his anti-religious tone...Grow up!  It's about time someone shook the hallowed pillars and demanded something more than pretense and pious greed.  Not every radical arrives at the proper conclusion, but we still need them to wake us from our complacent slumber.<br />At this task, Kleier and Jeza succeed.	2000-12-29

This is not a New Age manual for freeing your creativity in ethereal ways.  This is Anne Lamott, for heaven's sake...and that means it's funny! As in, laugh- till-you-can't-read-the-words-through-the-tears-in-your-eyes funny. (Some call this therapy, and I'm inclined to agree.)<br />Though aimed at writers, this book is full of sage advice and razor-edged honesty for the average joe.  If you're a writer--and I claim to be one--it's more than a few anecdotes and good advice; it's a lifeline in the thrashing seas of rough-draftdom, a foothold on the sands of jealousy and vain ambition.  Anne makes it clear that writing must be pursued for something other than mere publication. (Though, to be honest, I know she's just trying to let the majority of us down easy.)  Writing is about letting go, growing, facing truths, and holding on.<br />I'm hooked on Lamott.  She slaps me in the face with her startling revelations, nudges me in the ribs with her unpredictable humor, and prods my frozen little writer's hands back into action with warm compassion.  This book won't solve the mechanical aspects of my writing, or lead me on the path of structural excellence, but it will spark my creativity, free my characters to be true to themselves, and, ultimately, shake me from my doldrums back into the writing mode.<br />In a society addicted to mindless facts and information, &quot;Bird by Bird&quot; reminds us--writers or otherwise--that it's all about heart.  Heart and mind and soul dancing together, even if they step all over each other's feet.	2000-12-28

This has been one of my most anticipated reads in a while; I loved &quot;The Iron Lance.&quot;<br />Once again, Lawhead creates a vivid setting for his characters, replete with mouth-watering food, colorful garb, and back-breaking responsibilities.  Once again, he transports us from Scotland to the lands of the Crusades.  This time, it's Murdo's son, Duncan, who sets off on his own quest.  This time, Duncan is the first-person narrator, telling the story of his travels to his daughter Caitriona.  (My guess is that she will be the protagonist of his next book in the series, to be titled &quot;The Mystic Rose.&quot;)<br />Though I read the book quickly--after the initial twenty pages, which seemed a bit muddied--I missed Murdo's cynicism and spiritual encounters from the first book.  Here, Duncan has no real cross to bear; basically, he just wants a part of the adventure his father had.  Even his personal tragedy early in the book has no real influence on his decision-making later.  His motivations seem not as strong, and--in fact--I found it a bit difficult to swallow that he leaves behind his daughter after what they had experienced.  (I can't go into detail without giving things away.)  If Lawhead had described even a brief farewell scene, I might've made this jump easier.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the book.  Not as much as &quot;The Iron Lance,&quot; but still a vivid and memorable experience.  The search of the Caliph's treasure house and the ensuing escape were heart-pounding adventure at its finest.  While I don't always understand the motivations of some Lawhead characters, Lawhead always manages to bring a grace and dignity and honor to his people which I appreciate.<br />&quot;The Mystic Rose,&quot;  when it comes out, will sit high on my list.	2000-12-22

His subtlety is well-established, and I'm sure he feels the pressure to push the envelope, to better his last attempts.  Usually, he succeeds, or at least satisfies.<br />Here, le Carre's subtlety is exchanged for a sock-it-to-'em opening.  Gripping, captivating...all that jazz.  From there, however, he slips deeper into his renowned subtlety than I've ever seen him do.  In &quot;The Night Manager,&quot; the innuendos and atmospheric textures were initially bewildering and finally mesmerizing.  In &quot;Single &amp; Single,&quot; these attempts fall flat.<br />The threads of the first few chapters weave together, revealing the tapestry of Tiger Single's high-finace world--a world of shady dealings and shadier characters.  Oliver, Tiger's son, becomes our eyes into this world.  His sometimes childlike innocence is contrasted with his legal knowledge, and his conscience soon becomes weighted by the workings of Single &amp; Single.  This culminates in his betrayal of his own father.<br />The rest of the book pursues the redemption of father and son relations, the justice due a murderer, and the maturation of a boy grown up in his father's shadow.<br />Yes, le Carre carries out his task competently.  No scene or character rings untrue.  On the other hand, few of them are able to breathe life into this tired horse of a thriller.  Aside from Oliver, it's the minor characters--his mother, his father's janitorial guardian, etc--that stick in the memory.  Oliver's relationships with women seem two dimensional and lacking in depth or motivation, on the womens' parts anyway.<br />When we first meet Oliver Single, we meet him in his role of magician.  As he steps out of his shell, as he pulls his own identity out of the hat, everything else in the book seems to pale.  This novel, measured by le Carre's own standards, is a one-trick pony.  A well-groomed creature, but short on magic.	2000-12-15

This book is like a quality photograph of an acre of dirt-clods.<br />Grisham, as usual, masterfully unveils his plot, but he fails to make us care about any one character in particular.  The majority of the characters are the dirt-clods (with all manner of selfish motives), and the one or two we do find sympathy for are given only enough time to move the story another step forward.<br />The story follows three law-breaking federal judges who now serve out their sentences in Trumble, a low-security prison.  These judges, though well-depicted in their motivations, are somewhat despicable as they extort money via a gay personal ad scam.  Things hit the fan when they find that they've snared a presidential candidate, Aaron Lake.  Not only is Lake a &quot;squeaky clean&quot; candidate with a lot to lose personally, he's also being catapulted toward the presidency by shady CIA maneuverings.<br />The bottom line: The three scam-artist judges, AKA: the Brethren, now stand in the way of the CIA's plans for the next president.<br />Sure, the plot is intriguing, particularly with our recent presidential debates and election disasters.  Ultimately, though, I felt hooked by an empty story.  I sped through the pages to see what would happen, but came away thinking, Who cares?<br />Grisham's best work, in my opinion, centers around one or two flawed but likeable characters.  &quot;The Brethren&quot; centers around ten or twelve flawed and generally unlikeable ones.  For that reason, I cannot recommend this book. Let's hope his next book is full of feeling and heart--everything this story lacked.	2000-11-16

His writing, though simple, is fast-paced and effective.  So long as I set aside my &quot;Elements of Grammar&quot; book, I'm able to enjoy his creative premises and engaging plots.<br />In this, his fourth adult novel and my favorite to date, Myers explores the idea of a parallel universe very like our own society where Jesus/Eli has just arrived on the scene. A media man, Conrad Ellis, is thrust into this parallel universe by a life-threatening car accident.  As his family gathers in one universe and weighs important issues, Conrad lives life in the parallel universe as a follower of Eli.<br />Eli is a noncompromising person who shows love and grace and a leaning toward humor. He leads a group of followers across the America, preaching and teaching his gospel message. Of course, he is not without detractors, particularly the religious leaders of the day. Eli is a threat to their status quo.<br />Myers cleverly works in Biblical parables and miracles.  Eli's dialogue directly parallels Jesus's words at times without sounding outdated.  I was mildly disappointed by the depiction of Jake/Peter's denial, and I would've liked more of Eli's personal interaction after his resurrection, but overall Myer's captures the gist of the Gospels in a powerful way.<br />&quot;Eli&quot; works on most levels and definitely made me consider what our collective reaction would've been if Jesus had arrived in our present culture.  Although some reviewers have noted the discrepancies with A.D. (anno domino) dating, Myers never actually dates anything in the parallel universe; at only one time does Conrad assign a date in his own mind to the clothing and styles of the hippie generation.<br />Yes, Conrad is slow to recognize certain parallels, but for the story's sake he advances slowly. In this manner, Myers is able to take the reader through a similar heart change--and therein lies this novel's power..	2000-11-09

It slow in catching fire, but once it does...oh, boy--watch this story burn!<br />Similar to the third installment of Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; Lawhead's third Albion book starts somewhat slow and atmospheric, but succeeds in setting the stage for greater things to come.  We follow Llew's journey as a king and husand, watching as he falls in love with his land and his lady.  When both are threatened, &quot;The Endless Knot&quot; comes alive, following Llew, Cynan, Scytha, and the Ravens as they journey to the Foul Land in search of the kidnapped brides.<br />The depictions of evil and malice are imaginative and memorable, and even more awe-inspiring are the victories of the Swift Sure Hand toward the end of the trilogy.  For the first time in this series, I felt my breath taken away as it has been at times in reading Tolkien's masterpiece. This book contains imagery beyond anything I've read by Lawhead before, and he tidely--if not a bit quickly--ties it all together at the end with a clear connection between Llew's sacrifice for his bride and the sacrifice of Christ for his church (his bride, as well).<br />Though the biblical allegory is minimal, it's effective. We reach the end of the story exhilarated and exhausted, only to find we are back at the story's beginning.  In this clever manner, Lawhead demonstrates the circle of life and &quot;The Endless Knot.&quot; Instead of feeling knotted up, I felt freed...by the story, by the prose, by the clear and purifying Song of Albion.	2000-11-04

Add to that a number of supernatural incidents and &quot;coincidences,&quot; and these four strangers are on their way, willing or not.  Of course, a number of unexpected invitees show up as well.<br />Yes, the premise intrigued me.  The characters drew me in.  And the mysteries of the plot kept me hanging on.  Each time I thought things would turn horribly, predictably sappy, they turned a different direction.  Yes, by the end, the spiritual lessons came on strong and fast, but the groundwork had been layed and I was willing to swallow the medicine. Somehow, Nancy Moser's writing won me over, despite my vague concerns.<br />This type of writing isn't my main reading diet, but Moser's obvious identification with these spiritual truths made them come alive in a way a nonfiction book would not have. Though this story may not appeal to some, I found myself speeding through and curious to see where the characters God-given talents will take them in the sequel.<br />Is &quot;The Quest&quot; as intriguing?  If so, I'll be picking that one up soon.	2000-11-04

Why?  Because it's dark, maybe.  Because it doesn't paint a gleeful, daisy-filled meadow scene for us, possibly.<br />And these are the reasons I consider this his best.<br />Without forgetting to grab our attention and build his characters, Peretti sets the stage for a powerful spiritual metaphor that hits the reader between the eyes.  The seductive oath of this town comes back to haunt them, and by the end, no one will be left unchanged--for better of for worse.  The consequences of flirting with sin are starkly portrayed here.  Don't give up too soon; read on to the finish and you'll understand Peretti's point.<br />Of all Peretti's books, this one alone have I been able to pass out freely to my nonbelieving friends.  The story is genuinely intriguing--not just a hastly sketched backdrop for a sermon--and it grabs your attention, demanding that you heed its warning.<br />This may not be for all readers, particularly those who like syrupy romance or immediate feel-goods, but it's worth the effort.  If you like no-holds-barred Christian fiction, &quot;The Oath&quot; is for you.	2000-11-03

Am I surprised that a radical writer of Palahniuk's stature should arise from the creative quagmire of Oregon's artistic backwaters?  Not at all.  I, too, am an Oregon resident, and I encounter semblances of Palahniuk's philosophy in daily conversation.<br />But to encounter such a passionate and cohesive worldview within the scope of a single book--and a relatively short one, at that--is mind-boggling!<br />Following the near-emotionless life of Tender Branson, we move from reluctant respect or revulsion to a downright sympathetic view as we realize his past.  Tender is a survivor--eventually, one of the last--of a religious death cult.  He failed to follow through on his own suicide, and now ekes out a robotic existence as a cook/housekeeper of sorts for a pathetically materialistic couple.  As the story moves along, we discover Tender's past and watch him become a media darling, a &quot;messiah&quot; thrown to the starving masses like a piece of meat.  Only in facing his own fears and inadequacies does Tender Branson take flight towards freedom...an open-ended freedom that leaves us wondering whether he escaped his past or his future as well.<br />Some will be offended and use the semi-blasphemous nature of this story to discount its underlying truth and anguish.  Others will relish the shock-value and overlook the bitter heartache and despair that breed such feelings of impotence and aloneness. For those who are willing to use &quot;Survivor&quot; as a magnifying glass, this story brings into stark detail the horrors of religion breeding with commercialism and the travesty of community that loses sight of its individual members.<br />&quot;Survivor&quot; will certainly shock and offend--and maybe that's the point.  Palahniuk seems driven by the need to jolt back to life a generation that's grown devoid of direction and meaning.  In a world innoculated by entertainment violence and extremes, he puts those very weapons in our hands--in the form of a novel--and challenges us to count the cost...Do we believe in something more?  Something greater than ourselves?  Something worth living for?  Or should we cave in to society's sheep-mentality and allow ourselves to be herded through the 40 hour work-chutes week after week until the day of sacrifice?<br />To be honest, I don't come away with any more answers than I arrived with...but I come away from Palahniuk's novels convinced not to settle for status quo, convinced to rise above the cesspool of commercialism and search for deeper meaning than the air-brushed advertisement babes want to sell me.<br />&quot;Survivor&quot;?

I was intrigued by Pat Conroy's comments on the jacket and decided to dive in.  Shoot, I could always close 'er up and turn 'er back in to the late night book return slot, right?<br />No need for that!<br />Bragg's poignant writing drew me in to the story, wrenching laughs and smiles and grimaces and tears from me like a carpenter pulling nails.  His account of growing up as poor white trash, raised by a mom who endured the usually brief and alcohol-scented visits of her husband had sad elements to it, but the dignity of his mom and uncles lifts this from tragedy.  By the end, I'd almost come undone.  And I don't say that lightly.  The emotional impact caught me somewhat off-guard.  With tight, yet unpretentious writing, Bragg snuck up on me and I barely maintained control as I worked through the last few pages.<br />A tear-jerker?  For some, yes.  But they weren't all sad tears--some very happy ones, as well.  The bittersweet aspects of life run throughout Bragg's story, and I found myself savoring the good things, pondering the bad.<br />Don't pass this one by.  It's worth the time and the energy. The fascinating jumps from Haiti to Miami to the hallowed halls of Harvard all serve as a backdrop to the struggles of self-discovery, forgiveness, and family strength.<br />When I was done, I felt like following Pat Conroy's lead by sending Bragg's mother a bouquet of flowers.  Who knows, I might do just that.  I just might.	2000-10-26

Oh me, of little faith...I still figured she must've had a collaborator on this project.<br />A few days ago, my wife and I saw Carolyn perform some of her music and read portions from this new book.  She was poignant and humble, funny and quick-witted, and she answered questions from the audience with the same honesty and vocabulary of the book.<br />This book's for real.  And that's the point...<br />Carolyn lets her questions and struggles rise to the surface, lets us see her fears and failures and the way she's dealt with God in regards to such things. Through humorous and heart-touching chapters, she peels back the facade so many feel pressured to live behind, and shows us that God can handle our doubts.  No, the answers may not always come easily, but the lines of communication are not disconnected by our struggles.<br />I've read Anne Lamott--who, due to her harsher upbringing, may be more than a little shockingly honest for most Christians--and have enjoyed Phillip Yancey's writing, too.  Carolyn Arends finds a happy medium by delivering road-tested wisdom in an always reverent manner.<br />&quot;Living the Questions&quot; is a rare gem in a world of syrupy feel-goods and fakey Pharisee smiles.  Here, the real Answer shines through.	2000-10-10

The experience was wonderful and, when she became pregnant with our second child while we worked in Europe, she almost demanded we return to Oregon to the same midwife that delivered the first.<br />The result?  Two beautiful daughters.<br />In a style reminiscent of &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars,&quot; Bohjalian faithfully renders the midwife experience--though I think the title alone tends to alienate many male readers--and I found myself concerned with Sybil's legal trouble, having faced similar prejudices from even close friends during our two pregnancies.  Is this book slow-paced or tedious, as some previous reviewers claim?  Only if you lack compassion for this well-meaning midwife and her family.  Yes, the story is character-driven, but a deceptively simple plot also throbs beneath the surface--like the weak pulse of a person presumed dead. This story has life!<br />The narrator, the midwife's daughter, plays a key role in the unveiling of court and household events, and I found myself racing toward the ending, despite what I thought might be a predictable outcome.<br />If you're willing to put in the labor, this book might take you late into the night, watching the birth of a heart-rending and redeeming tale.	2000-09-28

I picked this one up at the used bookstore and hoped I wasn't purchasing  someone else's junk.  The premise was intriguing--though a bit misleading  on the front jacket statement--and the layout looked good, but I'm often  disappointed by Christian fiction.  (I keep trying to like it...I really  do.)<br />Okay, this time I wasn't disappointed.  I read the first two  chapters, testing the waters like a wary swimmer, and next thing I knew,  I'd summoned the courage to dive in.  Two days later, I surfaced with this  treasure clutched firmly in hand and a smile on my face.<br />Myers built his  characters with adequate depth and added enough details regarding  paranormal research for me to suspend disbelief.  I appreciated his  balanced, yet insightful, views of demonic activity and found myself  whipping through the pages.  The ending left room for a sequel while still  wrapping up most of the loose ends, and Myers didn't shy away from showing  that spiritual battle does have casualties--on both sides.<br />Why not five  stars?<br />Though fast-paced and credible, Myers doesn't write with quite the  tightness and craft of Peretti or the Thoenes.  A number of times he  stumbled over point-of-view problems, though not to the point of confusing  the story.  It was merely a distraction.  One an editor could've easily  cleaned up.<br />Myers comes up with some great premises and manages to fill  them with practical and allegorical insight.  His writing seems to be  maturing, and I'll be hunting down his next books with unabashed  anticipation.<br />Next time, I'll dive in without hesitation.	2000-09-19

After mild disappointment with the Billy Bob Holland series, I couldn't  wait for another stretch of potholed Dave Robicheaux road.  &quot;Purple  Cane Road&quot; was the precise route to page-whipping passion and  heart-wrenching honesty that I'd been hoping for.<br />This novel races along  faster than any of his previous installments.  Burke uses unusually short  scenes to fuel this V8 engine and, though his meandering  descriptions--which I personally love--are farther and fewer between, he  manages to convey deep atmosphere and mood.<br />The story follows  Robicheaux's search for his mother's killers and his mission to save an  abused woman on death row from lethal injection.  Characters, new and old,  pace back and forth over Purple Cane Road until it's clear someone will get  run over by the secrets of the past.  Clete tries, as always, to plant  himself in the path of the plot's moving vehicle--or maybe he's the very  vehicle out of control.  Robicheaux, too, veers close to the edge of  disaster.  With tantalizing brevity, we see his troubles with his wife and  his budding teenage girl, Alafair.<br />This is the Robicheaux I missed:  though he continues to grow as a person, he's still half-sinner,  half-saint.  Even in the last sentences, we see him take steps away from  the dark voids of his childhood toward a brighter retirement.  Retirement?  Nah, I doubt it.  Not after a not-so-subtle hint from his superior near the  story's conclusion.<br />Burke can crank his characters' engines and send them  spinning over rough and twisted plotting better than most other writers.  These flawed characters are so prone to make mistakes that you come to  expect them; and then, unexpectedly, they manage to rise once again above  their own miry pasts and do something truly honorable.<br />Above all, despite  the line-up of evil and tainted characters, Burke's writing displays honor  and courage and the yearning for justice.  He refuses to protect his  characters from every ill-intention, refuses to set them on moral  soapboxes, yet he manages to set a compass by delineating the choices  between good and evil.  In this manner, his cast of colorful people stands  above the regular assortment of fictional cardboard props and demands to be  heard, whether through a whisper or a scream.<br />Keep 'em coming, Burke.

The basic story is compelling, and certain scenes  come vividly to life in the imagination.  I appreciated the good vs evil  aspects and felt he handled them well without turning them into  sermonettes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as in Leviathian, I felt he ran out of plot.  He keeps the story going with one, or two, or three more incidents of the  monster rising again from the rubble.  It's similar to a thrill-ride on a  careless action flick--it's fun while it lasts, but when it's over, you  feel vaguely empty.<br /><br />Huggins seems to have found a niche, and he has the  skill to portray his ideas.  I only wish he would flesh out the characters  more, and leave some of the imagery for us readers to flesh out on our own.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I'll wait for the intelligent thriller I know he has  brewing somewhere inside.  In my opinion, he hasn't served that one up quite yet.	2000-09-10

Edgewood and the activist's parents are looking for answers, but  a conspiracy of some sort seems to stand in their way. Edgewood's  struggles, though, are more than professional.  The issues he deals with  have been dealt with in a number of legal thrillers, but rarely so  delicately as Bunn accomplishes here.  This book is about much more than  crossing mere cultural divides.<br />Though the pace trods a bit slower than a  standard Grisham thriller, this book sweeps you along with its rich  characters and locales.  (I would've enjoyed more scenes in China, but then  I've traveled there extensively and maybe that's an appetite all my own.)  Bunn showcases his abilities here like never before. When you're done  reading, these characters will continue walking through your thoughts, the  detailed settings will stand solidly in your mind, the more than occasional  moments of literary gold will set themselves in your memory. In addition,  his brief but appropriate spiritual moments leaven the mood with thoughts  of &quot;The Great Divide&quot; we must all face at some point.<br />Despite  an abundance of secondary characters, Bunn masterfully maintains each  individual's uniqueness, including blacks and Asians with only an ounce of  stereotyping. (Aren't stereotypes based on at least some truth usually?) He  juggles the emotions, the trial, and the relationships with care and  compassion.  Though I found certain aspects of the trial to lean  inordinately in the plaintiff's direction, I'm no legal expert and I was  more than willing to let them slide in favor of the author and his  loveable--and despicable--cast.<br />If Bunn follows this one up with another  legal thriller, I'll pre-order the book.  He seems to have found his niche.  Hopefully, he'll also find the audience he deserves.slide in favor of the author and his  loveable--and despicable--cast.<br />If Bunn follows this one up with another  legal thriller, I'll pre-order the book.

This is a raw and real story, set in the recent American West, where men are  expected to be men, and dreamers are tossed to the side.<br />Ezra Riley is  an artistic kid stuck in Montana.  He loves the land and the work, but his  personality is being stifled.  Through a series of events, he returns to  his childhood home and memories, forced to face his fears and inadequecies.<br />Moore writes with depth and feeling, slowly dragging you into the  story, slowly twisting your heart into a knot.  When he finally lets go on  the last page, he doesn't do so flippantly or tritely--like many Christian  novelists--he does so with tough and tender appreciation for his reader,  his protaganist, and for the God that Ezra Riley's been fighting  throughout.<br />This book will set in your thoughts with all the warmth and  poignancy of the setting Montana sun.	2000-09-02

Where is God in the middle of it all?<br />The  lessons of this book are heartfelt: Even in our trials, even through the  detours and hardships, God's plans can bear fruit in our lives.  Our dreams  sometimes come true in unexpected ways.<br />Stokes starts the story strongly,  following the lives of four women and their dreams, as discovered through  the eyes of a disenchanted reporter.  The stories fit seamlessly together  and the characters come to life through Stokes' writing.<br />Here's my  complaint: Just as I became involved in the difficult questions facing each  character, the story-line would make a huge jump and tack on the lesson  each had learned through the years.  The lessons and the questions were  realistic; however, I would've appreciated seeing the wrestling of each  personality through those difficult years.  That wrestling process is  implied and hinted at, but the answers seem almost trite when we are robbed  of the entire story.<br />I'm looking forward to reading Stokes' next book.  She can write and she has a story to tell.  I only hope that this time she  shows me the whole story, instead of telling me the lessons.	2000-08-29

Lawhead's mythic history draws you in.  Not  only did his detailed landscape and time-period come to life in my mind,  but the characters, in their reserved manner, became breathing people that  you care and cheer for.<br />But this story isn't heavy on the cheers; it  describes many heartaches and inhumanities.  It peels back the horror of  what the Crusaders did in the name of Christ and clearly shows the misdeeds  of the Church.  Yet, through the likeable monks of the Cele De, the main  character comes to see another side of spirituality, eventually warming to  the monks and their beliefs.<br />The story, primarily, follows young Murdo as  he follows after his father and brothers toward the Holy Land.  He needs  their help to take back the land that's been stolen from them.  Along the  way, he witnesses the Crusaders' violent ways, he experiences mystical  visions, and he finds himself brushing shoulders with the Holy Lance, the  spear used to pierce Jesus's side at the scene of the Crucifixion.  Now,  the spear is a holy relic sought by many.<br />The transformations of Murdo  from nonbeliever to believer, from boy to man, are credible.  You'll find  yourself holding your breath as he searches for the Holy Lance and attempts  to escape those who wish to steal it for their own devices.<br />This story  deals with large issues--the corruption of the church, the brutality of  man, the secrecy of centuries-old societies in the British Isles--and it  still manages to touch on smaller, more personal issues such as love,  loyalty, and family.<br />Some may find the details overwhelming or laborious;  I found myself closing the final page wishing for more.	2000-08-22

Adah is, on the surface, the most complex  creation--and I enjoyed her backward insights--but Leah sneaks up on you,  becoming a woman of deep-rooted motivations and disillusionment.  Rachel,  for an older teen, was portrayed as, in her own words, &quot;a dumb  blond,&quot; yet with this in mind I still had a difficult time accepting  her misuse of language...ie. exetera (et cetera), addenda (agenda),  feminine wilds (wiles), for all the teeth in China (tea in China)...You get  the picture.  Ruth May, the youngest, conforms to character, though a bit  verbose for a five year old.  Of course, Oleanna, the mother, is richly  detailed in her steadfast commitments, her motherly yearnings, her deep  depressions, and searching for understanding from her own  offspring.<br />Which brings me to the frustratingly brilliant aspect of this  story...Nathan Price.  We only come to know him through his family's  perspective.  This man fits the stereotype of the Great White Missionary,  come to save the heathens by turning them into monogamous little Americans.  Having been an MK (Missionary Kid) for a number of years myself, I can say  this stereotype, sadly, has its basis.  But Kingsolver sorely neglects to  paint a balanced, or accurate, picture of this chosen life pursuit.  Many  missionaries I've rubbed shoulders with--from China to Brazil to the Czech  Republic--are genuinely dedicated people who love their families foremost  and adapt humbly to their second cultures rather than plundering the  natives, as it were.<br />There: Got that off my chest.  I've swallowed the  bitter poison of religion-turned-stark-raving-mad...and I still believe in  the hope it offers when based on Biblical balance not the lunatic fringe's  version of a holy calling.<br />Nathan Price successfully sabotages his own  efforts, his host village, and his precious family in the quest to save his  own soul.  Shame on the man.  Through Kingsolver's eye for detail, we see  the devastating effects of this man's metaphorical exploitation that  parallels America's similar exloitation of the Congo.<br />The crux of the  issue for Oleanna, early on, is summed up in her own words: &quot;I could  never work out whether we were to view religion as a life-insurance policy  or a life sentence.&quot;  Nathan Price clamps the chains of religion  around his family's ankles and only when he is out of the picture are we  allowed to witness their escape, their individual chain-dragging survival  methods.  Kingsolver, through emotional rawness and detailed metaphoric  description of the ravaged Congo, shows the trek of these women toward the  light of normalcy and acceptance.<br />Not all will succeed in finding that  light, but we care deeply as we watch the trek unfold.  &quot;The  Poisonwood Bible&quot; is a book of pain and beauty, of sorrow and hope.  Ultimately, like my own experience as an MK, we come to believe that one  can swallow poison and still believe in the ability to move on.version of a holy calling. <br />Nathan Price successfully sabotages his own  efforts, his host village, and his precious family in the quest to save his  own soul.

Here, the story is  intriguing, but takes few original twists or turns.<br />The idea of a person  experiencing amnesia and then becoming caught up in international espionage  has been played out many times, in many different ways.  What makes  &quot;Distant Memory&quot; different, and what ultimately redeemed the  effort for me personally, was the exploration of the idea that even if  one's mind has gone blank, their soul remains saved.<br />The premise,  though noteworthy, remains only scratched on the surface, and I finished  the book with a sense of minor disappointment.  Beside the occasional  technical problems--should all three villians have names that start with M,  for example?--Gansky competently unveils his plot with just enough intrigue  to keep you reading to the end.	2000-08-05

I've long admired West's ability to move me with words.  His papal trilogy in particular ranks as one of my favorite in literary fiction. To read this delightfully honest and heartfelt memoir is to gain even greater insight to  the wisdom and insights of his fictional work.<br />West, long a respectful  rebel of sorts, has managed to approach subjects and questions many wish to  avoid.  In doing so, rather than turning these into platforms for personal  grievances, he elevates their importance in community discussion.<br />Despite  his literary prowess, West manages to come across as an everyday man, a man  you'd like to converse with over coffee.  No, don't remind me that the most  likely place for conversation would be at his deathbed.  He may be getting  older, nearer to unknown that he says he welcomes willingly, but his words  will remain as a part of our culture.  His thoughts and ideas will remain  to challenge future generations.<br />Mr Morris West, thank you for that gift.	2000-07-29

With stark realism and deep insight, he probes one man's outer and inner struggles for survival after washing up on a rock in the mid-Atlantic.  I found the psychological portrail wholly  believable, but I had a difficult time sympathizing with this character.  He's a womanizer, a self-centered egotist. With near-animal drive, he  carves out meager existence on the rock.  I found very little emotional  connection with Martin, and read on primarily because of Golding's  narrative power.<br />Essentially, Golding seems to say that, brought to our  lowest common denominator in a fight for life, we are all self-centered,  that greed takes over.  I found the argument weak because we discover that  Martin was this way already.  I would've liked to see a selfless person's  fight for existence and the consequences of his actions.<br />Or maybe  that's Golding's point: Martin's self-centeredness eventually corrodes his  ability to survive because the motivations run shallow.  Numerous true-life  accounts show the struggle of men and women to rise above their base needs  and extend life heroically to others. Selflessness often leads to the  survival of the group, it seems, but in this book we have only one  character's survival to consider.<br />A second reading might reveal to me  more of Golding's intentions in this story, but the fact remains: Golding  knows how to build word upon word until you are trapped within the dwelling  of his character's minds.  That alone lifts this book above the volumes of  so-called literature stacked on most shelves.<br />Based on Golding's own  standards from his other books, I cannot highly recommend this as a great  story, but only as a great example of powerful wordage and  characterization.  I think Golding sells us short here on the premise of  survival.  I finished the last page with little emotional or intellectual  reaction.  I felt, like Martin, only blank disillusionment.	2000-07-25

For some reason, he switches narrators and unnecessarily forces the reader to  make a mental jump, but once that jump is made, the story breezes  along.<br />Tegid, the bard, and Llew, the reluctant king, set about carving a  new life for themselves while Meldron, the usurper, thinks they're dead.  They have time to rebuild and form a company of sorts, but when Meldron  catches on to their survival, we know the showdown will eventually  come--and to mostly satisfactory results.<br />Lawhead fills his story with  rich details and memorable scenes, but, as in the first book, he makes some  apparent blunders.  Though I was intrigued by the re-appearance of Nettles  from the first book, his character never played a true role in the events  of the story.  Lawhead seemed to set him up for significance, then let me  down.  This type of thing happens occasionally in Lawhead's writing,  whether due to poor plotting or forgetfulness, I do not know.<br />Overall,  though, I have to give this book a glowing recommendation.  Once finished  and set aside, I couldn't get it out of my mind.  The scenes were still  there, the characters still breathing, the questions still rumbling through  my thoughts.  Maybe, in this fictitous world come to life, like the real  world we inhabit, people and events don't always react or go as planned.  Maybe, there are bigger purposes, as of yet unknown to this reader.  Maybe,  I don't care...I just want to believe the Otherworld is out there, and the  Song of Albion is being sung, bringing life to all who hear it.	2000-07-11

First, let me say I originally purchased Henderson's novel for my  wife.  No, really.  Second, I must tell you, this book is more mystery than  romance.  At least from this male's point of view.  Oh, sure, Kate meets  Dave, Kate falls in love with Dave, Kate and Dave face obstacles,  and...well, I shouldn't tell you the end.  But romance is in the air, no  doubt.<br />A true mystery is also at work here.  Dee Henderson lays out the  groundwork of her story with spartan efficiency--sometimes lacking a  definitive narrative style-and tosses in enough details to make you buy  into it.  She's done her research.  The dialogue, in particular, flows  naturally and breathes life and personality into these characters.  Though  the assortment of minor characters might be confusing to some, I assume  Henderson was fleshing out the story for this and future books in the  O'Malley series.<br />My wife, not an avid reader, finished the book a day  before me.  That's a good indication of &quot;The Negotiator&quot;s  intrigue.  The mystery is resolved, the roma--I mean, relationships come to  satisfactory conclusions, and the lessons learned are Biblically sound and  relevant.<br />I've since purchased Henderson's &quot;Danger in the  Shadows&quot;--for my wife, of course.  But if you read my review here  later, don't say I didn't warn you.	2000-07-09

He succeeds  brilliantly--and, let me add, gives Lewis credit for the basic premise.<br />In each chapter, we follow the struggles of the Fletcher family.  The  scenes are snippets really, backdrops for the corresponding 'letter' in  each chapter where Lord Foulgrin strategizes this family's downfall in  diabolical ways.<br />Though I might've enjoyed more fictional fleshing out of  the Fletcher's story, I was far from disappointed by Alcorn's insights into  the spiritual world.  This book will peel back the deceit of our culture  and challenge you to put your household in order.<br />Is CS Lewis turning in  his grave over this book?  If he is, it's probably to give Alcorn a hand.  In reading the enemy's mail, you'll be equipped to better thwart his  devices to divide the homes of America...including your own.	2000-06-25

Frazier's world is full of lyrical writing, gritty characters--I'll never forget the large, black prostitute or the goat woman--and memorable landscape.  True villians exist in his world, as do those with both foibles  and human hearts.  The plot can basically be encapsulated in a paragraph,  but the nuances of these characters continue to be unveiled till the last  page.  Frazier transported me to the horror and despondency of the Civil  War and filled his story with people I cared about.  Ada's stubborn  survival instincts linked with Ruby's are an ode to the women of the day.  If you like characters that'll stick in your mind for months to come, this  is the book for you.  Only with time can you discover just how impacting  this story truly is.	2000-06-02

Trekking through Lawhead's narrative is like a journey through the Celtic landscape he describes...sometimes tedious and cold, sometimes awe-inspiring and moving.  I was hooked by the initial premise and, as the  story moved into the Otherworld, I found myself increasingly pulled into  the story.  I breathed in the Albion air and walked with painted warriors.  Unfortunately, elements of the final conflict did not live up to the  potential inherent in the earlier destruction scenes; the Coranyid,  gruesome in description, never exuded the oppressive fear that you'll face  in Tolkien's masterpieces.  Even Nudd, lord of the Nether Realms, presented  a manageable foe.  This aside, I enjoyed Llew's journey into the Heart of  the Heart to discover the cure for all that ailed Albion.  The final pages,  even the final sentence, left me yearning for another trek through  Lawhead's imaginative world.  As the story closed, we caught a glimpse of  the true hero that Lewis, the Oxford graduate student, could be.  And a  glimpse of a more personal foe in the sequel.

The first few chapters of this novel grabbed me and refused to let go.  The selfish greed portrayed by the spoiled children of the  deceased had me hoping for justice; the contrasting selflessness portrayed  by the long-lost daughter had me cheering for the ideals and ethics of her  missionary lifestyle.  Grisham juggles his subplots so efficiently that I  was never afraid something would be dropped.  If anything, he puts on such  a splendid show in the first half of the book, that he was hard-pressed to  follow his own act in the second half.  I appreciated his sensitive and  faithful rendering of the missionary's viewpoints, preaching against the  greed of our age without, uh, well...preaching at us.  That's a 'testament'  to Grisham's true talent: moralizing while entertaining.  What a juggler!	2000-05-16

I went to a Borders reading with James Lee Burke and his humble, yet confident voice added new dimension to his characters...as if that's possible.  Dave Robicheaux and his buddy Clete Purcel just about walk into  the room anytime I open the pages of these books.  Unfortunately, Burke's  antagonists are just as palpable.  The evil lurking beneath the surface of  certain scenes is dark and frighteningly real.  It's hard not to cheer for  Robicheaux as he faces his foes and, usually, reacts before he thinks.  Burke wraps this gritty realism and dialogue in some of the most beautiful  and vivid metaphors around.  Some accuse Burke's writing of shallow  plotting, and I understand their viewpoint.  I choose, though, to wander  along with Dave Robicheaux through the heat and sound and smells of his day  and see where it may lead us.  Somehow this style gives his stories an  uncharted realism that I personally appreciate. Like the cajun food Burke  writes of, his words are alive with flavor and texture and subtlety beneath  a layer of eye-popping spices.  And--as his fans well know--your sense of  smell will also be invited to the meal. Pull up a chair and savor some good  Louisiana cooking.	2000-05-13

After reading this book, I found the sound and substance of the story still playing in my mind for  days.  Junger paints these fishermen in a journalistic style that elicits  your sympathy without begging for it.  By the time the storm hits, I cared  about these people, these boats.  The historical background added dimension  to their plight.  I nearly gasped audibly at the cataclysmic power of the  sea as viewed through this author's words.  The rescue efforts of the Coast  Guard were heroic--though not all involved can take credit for that--and I  had new respect for those who make their living from the sea.  It's hard to  imagine that Hollywood's attempt to capture these same emotions will  succeed; I fear this true story will be dipped into manufactured  sentimentalism.  If, by chance, they rise above the usual cheap thrills,  I'll be first in line to see the film.  But my own mental images, as  inspired by Junger's writing, are sure to overshadow the silver screen.	2000-05-08

After feasting on Guterson's &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars,&quot; I set aside a weekend to savor every tantalizing flavor of his new literary meal.  It  smelled so good; alas, the taste couldn't match the promised delight.  Guterson can write beautifully, evocatively, with keen perception into  human relationships.  He did this in his other &quot;feast&quot; while  surrounding these basic nutrients of writing with the spices and herbs of  strongly portrayed place and setting.  Once again, he tries to season his  wordy offering, but this time the herbs detract rather than enhance, the  spices bite rather than tease.  This journey from the mountains was barely  worth the climb.  But--golly gee--if Guterson sets the table one more time,  I'm sure I'll sit down for a bite.	2000-04-26

I hope he's enjoying the creativity of the only One more imaginative than himself--the Creator of the Universe.  As for us, still strapped to this mortal bowling bowl and rolling down the lane of history (hopefully, staying out of the gutter),  Tolkien's absence is our loss. I'm sulkin' without Tolkien...wishing he'd  written more, wishing he'd never written LOTR in the first place.  Why?  Because it's spoiled me--I can scarcely enjoy the barrage of inferior  fantasy. The musty, damp, and gritty reality of Middle Earth reveals  uncanny moments of beauty, then strips back the uneasy facade to show us  seductive and frightening evil. Only an author familiar with the spiritual  reality of such a cosmic battle could use a fictional tool to etch it into  our culture with such vividness.  And only a man like Tolkien, a man in  relationship with the True King in heaven, could show the costly, but  victorious battle against the Darkness.	2000-04-20

I had no idea what to expect in this, my first encounter with Anne Lamott.  The wide assortment of reviews convinced me to purchase the book--plus, the idea of reverence paired with irreverence, since we can all use a  little humor to season the subjects that matter most...that therefore  become so stinkin' divisive!  Wow!  When I'm not laughing at Anne's great  writing and gritty insights, I'm pushing down that lump in my throat.  Anne  plants and waters the flowers of faith and grace, but pats down their seeds  beneath the coarse dirt and smelly manure of life.  I'm not trying to match  her metaphors, I'm merely responding to the fresh light she's shone on my  own recent experiences.  This woman can write and, boy, does she have  something to say.  If she steps on your toes to get to the podium, so be  it.  Hear her out.  She writes of a heartfelt belief in Jesus that I share.  But she also drags out the skeletons that we born-again Christians are so  afraid to let out.  Ironic, isn't it, that those who follow Christ--the  most amazing example of love and acceptance and forgiveness to the  &quot;unlovely&quot;--are the very ones who insecurely point their fingers  at those outside their box.  I grew up in that box.  I still love Jesus,  still consider myself &quot;born-again,&quot; but I, along with Anne  Lamott, refuse to live in that box anymore.  Jesus, speaking to the  religious leaders of his day, called them &quot;white-washed tombs full of  dead man's bones.&quot;  Anne, in her gracious, irreverent way, says the  same.  Mercy me!  What a breath of fresh air!	2000-04-16

Whitlow's novel enveloped me in its opening premise of a secretive list that offered the hero instant fortune.  Set in the South, the plot  meandered occasionally into locale descriptions that added a lazy, summer  afternoon feel to the story.  This slowed the story, but added richness and  dimension to the characters.  Whitlow's eventual unveiling of the curse  attached to the list added a sobering spiritual touch to the story, but  thankfully the curse was foiled by young Renny and Jo's faith in God.  The  spiritual aspects, though accurate, came into the story strong early on,  and I feel might alienate those not comfortable with &quot;church  talk.&quot;  But if you can press on past that barrier, the message and  story are well worth your time.  A promising debut!	2000-04-10

Stanton Mystery Series #1)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Gansky's Gift	I have this habit of buying a book for a friend or family member, then opening to the first page and getting hooked.  That was Gansky's gift to me. His writing was tight, pulling me along into the questions regarding  the mysterious submarine.  He added a Christian message without letting it  overwhelm the plot.  The characters were well-drawn, though not with much  depth.  I'll look forward to learning more about them in upcoming books.	2000-04-07

I still love Congo--probably my favorite overall.  I approached this book with high expectations.  The premise intrigued me, and  I enjoy medieval settings.  Unfortunately, after a great build-up, I found  myself in a two-dimensional 14th century, with cardboard villians and  annoying scene-breaks (used to move along the story, I suppose).  Time  seemed to grind by as I read to the end.  It came as no surprise that some  early subplots never matured.  For example, what happened to Sophie?  Why  was she even introduced in her scenes with Chris early on?  I'd pass this  book on, but with only a half-hearted recommendation.  In the old days,  Crichton would've taken the time to make this book gallop.  Instead, it  came trotting to the finish line, taking first-place by using the shortcuts  allowed only by previous success.	2000-03-28

He makes a valiant effort.  I appreciated that he avoided cliched sermons and diatribes in the middle of  the story, and, at times, I was reminded of Morris West's sensitive  handling of Catholic issues. Unfortunately, I kept tripping over Parker's  forced similes and attempts at brisk narrative.  He has the right idea, but  a good editor could've cleaned this up, pared it into a lean thriller.  Like MacAuley, the book's overweight archaelogist, the plot tries to rise  to the occasion and deliver the knockout punch; instead, it trips over  itself and its own excess baggage.  With a fistful of antagonists to deal  with, I found myself fearing none of them.  Money seemed to be the primary  motivator for all of them.  Maybe deeper motivations for all involved  would've increased my own interest in the story.  I'll try another Parker  book.  Like his protagonist, Michael del Rio, he has the muscles; he just  needs a skillful editor to show him how to land those punches.	2000-03-28

The emotions and struggles of West's characters are real, heartfelt, and dated to the beginning of mankind.  In this way, I always relate to his stories, tantalized and drawn in by his graceful style and--often  un-American--sense of dignity.  On the other hand, the dialogue tends to  flow from pre-ordained scripts, rather than from the down-on-the-street  world most of us live in.  I usually overlook this stilted quality because  of the seductive narrative.  His words nearly hum a tune of honor and the  quest for truth in a world gone mad.  West is one of my favorite authors  and I enjoyed this story of Luca and Isabel and the political jockeying  within the Vatican, but I wouldn't rate it among his best.  I hope he has  one more truly original premise to vent in his latter days.  Meanwhile, try  his nonfiction offering &quot;A View from the Ridge.&quot;  This man truly  attempts to reconcile faith with the darkness of the world around us--and  for that he sits high on my list of influential authors.	2000-03-23

I like that.  Sometimes it works better than others,  though--that's the risk he takes. (More power to him.)  Here, the risk was  seeming shaky at first.  I liked the initial premise--and no, the prologue  didn't throw me off track as it did some of my friends--but I couldn't tell  where this ride was taking me. Then, slowly, I found myself absorbed in the  Travis' past, relating to every detail of his church experiences, laughing  to the point of poignant tears at some parts.  This book tackles some of  the spiritual questions the church often avoids.  It refuses to give pat  answers, refuses to resolve everything in the usual casual manner, and left  me feeling refreshed...I'd waded through some of my own struggles with this  fictional character and realized others struggle too.  Okay, the conclusion  in the town streets got a little wacky and melodramatic, but the deeper  issues hit home.  Don't be put off by the slow-motion start--this book  wants to slam-dunk you, if you'll let it.	2000-03-20

I actually purchased this book as a gift for my grandmother, another Thoene fan.  It arrived two days before her party.  (Yes, thank you Amazon! They upgraded the shipping for  free.) But then I read the first paragraph, realized it was the same  characters I'd come to love from the Zion Chronicles and Covenant years  ago, and--well, I was hooked.  I stayed up late reading two nights in a row  to finish it before the birthday party; I laughed aloud at the last line as  we pulled into the driveway! My grandmother's thrilled, and I feel like  I've met with old friends.  The drama and heartache of the Jewish struggle  come alive through these characters, leaving us asking for the sequel--due  out in the fall, from what the publisher says.  (And by the way, Viking/  Penguin did a great job with the cover and lay-out.) The writing is crisp,  historically informative, and heartfelt.  Thanks, Bodie and Brock for a  labor of love.	2000-03-20

I found myself yearning, however, for the honest hard work and satisfaction of  living off the land.  Morgan's style was crude at times--maybe  intentionally--but I've read other novels that captured that same gritty  character with a bit more passion.  When Julie's newlywed sister comes to  visit, for example, Morgan describes their laughter in every other  paragraph.  I got the point after the first two times.  He could have  plumbed the emotion and history with more feeling and depth...or maybe just  more writing elbow-grease.  But let's face it:  this book works its way  under your skin, demanding attention, or at least a reaction.  Julie and  Hank's relationship seems devoted, but more guarded than modern  relationships.  In the end, I enjoyed the coming together of the family,  even through tragedy.  The story had a message of hope, asking us to love  others more than ourselves.  Through its simple beauty and spartan writing,  Gap Creek eventually made its way into my heart.	2000-03-09

On the one hand, Alcorn paints a more realistic view of life than Christian novels often do; on the other hand, it dives deeply into  thought-provoking--sometimes contrived--discourse.  I appreciated the  transformation of the characters through the story, and found myself  looking forward to more in the next book, &quot;Dominion.&quot; Alcorn  seeks to deliver a message through his fiction, and he succeeds.  At times,  the story takes a backseat to the message, but he manages to gather the  plot threads back together before they fray into thinly veiled sermons.  For any readers put off by this book's length, try Alcorn's &quot;Edge of  Eternity.&quot;  It's a shorter, powerful allegory of the road to Jesus, a  modern Pilgrim's Progress, except this time the Pilgrim isn't quite sure  where he's headed. Don't try to read &quot;Deadline&quot; with any  deadlines--spend time with it and absorb it.  It might seep deeper than you  think.	2000-02-23

One look at this book and I was intrigued.  Then, a moment of doubt clouded my purchasing-decision-mode--could I judge this book by its cover?  I've been wrong before.  I purchased it anyway, and no, I wasn't  disappointed.  WYSIWYG...I've come to count on Scott's novels for  cyber-action, leavened with humor, sprinkled with a pinch of Christian  lessons, and full of likeable characters.  Gillette and Hamilton's  interaction is always enjoyable, as is Hamilton's relationship with his  family. Like Tom Clancy's character, Jack Ryan, Ethan Hamilton keeps  climbing the professional ladder, finding greater demand for his skills in  each novel.  I hope their are more rungs to this ladder.  It's not everyday  I find well-written Christian fiction, but Jefferson Scott's novels are  worth it.  If you can't locate them, keep looking.  Blame me if you're  disappointed.	2000-02-22

I accepted the invitation with a slight sense of skepticism--I'm often frustrated by the  mediocre quality of Christian fiction, and this was the first Phillips'  book I'd attempted...But I was soon carried away!  Swept into a past, rich  with characters, description, and historical relevance.  The writing was  superlative, the story compelling, and the mood vibrant with color and  emotion.  I was reminded more than once of the emotions and awe I sensed  while reading &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear.&quot;  I'm overjoyed to see  a well-written novel of this grandeur published by Bethany House.  Sure,  this novel will be too long for some readers, too involved for  some  thrill-seekers, but my hats off to author and publisher for presenting  quality literature for those willing to invest their time...It was worth  it!

As usual, I was skeptical in approaching a new Christian author.  I'm an avid reader, but 75% of my reading list is composed of secular novels.  Generally, I can't look past the plot, character, and writing flaws of  Christian novels.  Quality writing is sacrificed for the sake of a good  message...Why can't we combine the two?  Well, Scott does exactly that in  Virtually Eliminated. The characters live and breathe, the plot moves along  quickly, and the message is presented clearly without tossing away the  storyline.  Great job, Mr Scott.  I didn't even have a computer when I  first found your books, but I loved them.  Yes, I've read them all.  Keep  them coming, and try to get a publisher that'll push your stuff more.  The  present publisher does a great job of printing--I like the layout and  editing--but the marketing needs a kickstart.

I approached the opening book of the Left Behind series skeptically.  I've grown up in the church world, hearing the mish-mash of prophecy and fear  shoved in the faces of the pew-dwellers, sometimes for honorable  intentions, other times not.  Pleasantly, I was surprised by the  readability of the first book.  Though it's description may or may not be  the way God closes history, at least it challenged readers to weigh their  own life and actions.  Unfortunately, as the series has progressed, the  writing has stumbled, the plot has thinned, and the message has become  redundant.  Like a bag of chips, the series got me addicted to the salt and  fat, but now I'm merely overstuffed.  Let's have some true meat, not only  in the message, but in the method. Should Christians lower their artistic  standards to rush the latest fictional sermon to the masses?  I challenge  all of you who, like me, love Jesus and His creativity, to reconsider our  view of telling the Good News.  Many of my non-believing friends refuse to  read a novel unless it rises above the level of creative mediocrity.  Should we expect them to dip down to lap at the rivers of life?  Or can we  raise the truth to them in chalices of well-crafted writing?  Yes, God can  use the simple to confound the wise.  But He's also an incredible Creator,  and we're made in His image. Jenkins and LaHaye initially hit on something  special, but the record's been played one too many times.  I'm looking for  a novel that deals with the struggles of today, challenging and encouraging  while telling a great story. We may be running out of time, but we haven't  come close to stirring all the ideas available to writers who live in the  shadow of our Almighty Creator.	2000-01-11

Both styles of writing had their place.  And so  does Scott Turow. In Personal Injuries, he elevates the legal thriller to  something more...a glance into human nature and motivations, a study of  friendship, loyalty, and honesty. He does for this genre what John LeCarre  did for the espionage thriller.  No,he didn't keep me turning the pages at  the same speed as John Grisham.  He didn't have to.  I found myself wanting  to spend time with these characters, to understand the factors pushing them  to the book's conclusion. Although, the intermittent first-person point of  view was distracting and unnecessary, Turow manages to dance through  relational and emotional minefields without a misstep.  These characters  live and breathe.  Robbie Feaver, the defense lawyer caught in the sites  of the FBI, leads the reader and the federal agents on a twisting path of  deceit.  He's been paying off judges to rule in his favor on certain cases,  and he knows the buck doesn't stop there...Someone else has his finger on  the pulse of every crooked judge, and that someone else is padding his  pockets as well. The FBI offers Feaver leniency in exchange for his help to  bring down the judges and the crafty, squeaky-clean man at the top. Along  the way, Feaver's conniving ways give way to a sympathetic side, a human  heart beating beneath his deceptive exterior.  Can Evon Miller, his female  FBI tag-a-long playing the part of a girlfriend, trust him to gather the  necessary evidence to convict the judges?  Can she trust the deep secrets  of her heart to Feaver even as she lives in deep cover?  The answers to  these questions will ultimately determine the outcome of the operation. And  not everyone will walk away a winner.  Except, of course, for the reader  who's willing to become personally involved in the lives of Robbie and  Evon. Even lawyers experience  Personal Injuries. This was my first Turow  book. Yes, I'll be one of the first to read Grisham's newest in February,  but I'll look forward to a meatier diet with Turow's next offering.n the lives of Robbie and  Evon.
