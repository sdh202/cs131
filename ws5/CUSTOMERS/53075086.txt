Sort of like Halloween without the candy.<br /><br />Here, the transfer of the Crown Colony to Red China is only a few years away. A top executive in the London HQ of the Secret Intelligence Service unilaterally reactivates Geoff Howells, a former MI6 assassin previously forced into retirement after he began enjoying his work just a little too much. Geoff's mission - to kill Simon Ng, the head of a powerful Hong Kong triad, who's understood to be threatening the Beijing mandarins with the blowing of bloody big hole in the containment dome of a nuclear reactor located six miles upwind of the colony unless Hong Kong's handover is delayed fifty years, an unacceptable scenario to the Brits, who just want to exit gracefully ASAP. To bring Simon out from behind his protective walls and bodyguards, Howells kidnaps Sophie, Ng's daughter by his beautiful English wife, Jill.<br /><br />The basic elements of HUNGRY GHOST promise a lean and mean thriller. While it proves to be gratifyingly mean, it's less of the former through the introduction of a superfluity of characters: Pat Dugan, a Senior Inspector in the Commercial Crime Unit of the Hong Kong Police Department as well as Jill's brother, Simon Ng's father and brother, two CIA operatives, one very cute female assassin working for the People's Republic, and a golden-hearted bar girl named Amy. While all these extra players add complexity and interest, I suggest the novel would have been even better had it come down to a contest between Jill and/or Sophie and Geoff without all the other distractions. Indeed, author Stephen Leather has created strong-willed heroines to excellent effect in two other of his potboilers, THE BOMBMAKER and THE STRETCH, both of which transcend this volume in suspense and clever plotting and got 5 stars from me.<br /><br />Mind you, HUNGRY GHOST's 462 paper-backed pages provided better than average entertainment on a 4-hour rail ride from Bridgeport, CT to Baltimore, and a 5-hour flight from Baltimore to Los Angeles, when I wasn't otherwise dozing. And if, like me, you've been lucky enough to visit Hong Kong, this book summons up memories of that visually stunning city.

Or maybe I've just gotten cynical. However, there is a surplus of sociopaths, violent psychopaths, and generally sick puppies.<br /><br />Kudos, and 4 stars, to author Jeff Lindsay for creating in DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER a most unlikely hero, or at least protagonist, in Dexter Morgan, a blood splatter expert for the Miami Police Department, who's also a serial killer exercising his own brand of vigilantism. His victims - 37 to date - are those that society would perhaps like to see dead anyway, e.g. pedophile priests, child rapists, and at least one \\"mercy killer\\" RN. Dexter's modus operandi is to vivisection them to death. Nice.<br /><br />Here, Dexter is faced with a serial murderer of prostitutes whose method mimics his own. Morgan is torn between helping his foster sister, a Miami PD vice officer, catch the monster to jump start her stalled career and bonding with somebody who's obviously a soulmate. Wouldn't it be nice to work on some poor unfortunate together?<br /><br />In a world bereft hero figures, I'm left to seek them in fiction. Despite Lindsay's inventiveness, I don't see why I should have to adopt one whose elimination from the human gene pool would be so desirable. So, four stars to DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER notwithstanding, I don't intend to continue with the series.	2005-10-11

It follows GETTYSBURG, in which, after the first day of that battle in July 1863, Longstreet persuades Lee to eschew a frontal attack on the Union entrenchments on the heights above the town and make a wide sweep to the south into the Army of the Potomac's rear, a maneuver that results in the overwhelming defeat of Meade's command at the Battle of Union Mills. GETTYSBURG is one of the best books on the Civil War that I've ever read, be it fiction or otherwise.<br /><br />GRANT COMES EAST begins a couple of weeks later. Grant, fresh off his capture of Vicksburg and promoted to Lieutenant General, arrives in Cairo, IL to take charge of all the Union armies, and shortly travels on to Harrisburg, PA, where he'll form the Army of the Susquehanna with three corps from his old Army of the Tennessee plus the 19th Corps from New Orleans. In the meantime, General Lee, soon to be reinforced by General Beauregard and twenty-thousand troops up from South Carolina, must make a choice. Does he assault heavily fortified Washington, D.C., or attempt the capture of relatively undefended Baltimore and take Maryland out of the Union camp?<br /><br />The wild card is U.S. Major General Dan Sickles, promoted to command the remnants of the Army of the Potomac by Secretary of War Stanton before Grant had the requisite authority from Lincoln to veto the promotion. Sickles, a Democratic politician-general from New York, is feisty, brave, vain, ambitious and spoiling to take his smaller but reorganized and replenished force on a mission of vengeance against the Army of Northern Virginia regardless of Grant's strategic wishes. Besides, there's the 1864 Democratic presidential nomination to think of.<br /><br />As with any work of \\"what if\\", the danger, as one drifts further and further from the historical record, is to ascribe to the main personae actions inconsistent with their known abilities and characters. Here, plot newcomers (Grant, U.S. Congressman Elihu Washburne, Lincoln, Sickles, Stanton, Confederate President Jefferson Davis) take center stage along with those (Lee, Longstreet, U.S. Major General Haupt) carried over from GETTYSBURG. Authors Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen continue their commendable practice of keeping the key players and events believable. I didn't doubt for a moment that the Battle of Gunpowder River could've happened as it unfolded. Maybe it did in a parallel universe.<br /><br />I have the third book of the series, NEVER CALL RETREAT, on my shelf. I fully expect it to be as gripping and excellent as the previous two, and shall be sorely disappointed when I've finished the last page and have no more installments to savor. This is marvelous series, a must-read for all those even but mildly interested in the War Between the States.wcomers (Grant, U.S. Congressman Elihu Washburne, Lincoln, Sickles, Stanton, Confederate President Jefferson Davis) take center stage along with those (Lee, Longstreet, U.S. Major General Haupt) carried over from GETTYSBURG.

We will bury you!\\" - Nikita Khrushchev, November 17, 1956<br /><br />In DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, author Michael Dobbs begins his narrative on December 26, 1979 as members of the Soviet Union's ruling Politburo gather to lay before Communist Party General Secretary Brezhnev the final plans for the invasion of Afghanistan. Dobbs ends his narrative at 7:00 PM on December 25, 1991, when General Secretary Gorbachev, in a television address broadcast worldwide, formally dissolved the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.<br /><br />It would, perhaps, be too much to expect that the author record all the facts of that 12-year period that related to the dissolution of the Soviet Empire; the resulting book would be huge. Rather, in 451 pages, Dobbs does a splendid job touching on the salient events in chronological order to yield an immensely readable and instructive work of popular history: the Soviet occupation of Kabul (12/79), Solidarity's strike in Gdansk's Lenin Shipyard (8/80), the suppression of Solidarity (12/81), Brezhnev's death (11/82), the shoot down of KAL 007 (9/83), Gorbachev's accesion as General Secretary (3/85), the Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Geneva (11/85), Chernobyl (4/86), the first use of Stinger missiles against Soviet aircraft by Afghan mujahedin (9/86), Mathias Rust's farcical penetration of Soviet airspace (5/87), the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan (2/89), the Tbilisi riots (4/89), the resurrection of Solidarity (6/89), the fall of Berlin Wall and the revolt in Prague (11/89), the downfall of Romania's Ceausescu (12/89), Yeltsin's elevation to power (5/90), the Soviet invasion of Vilnius, Lithuania (1/91), and the abortive KGB coup against Gorbachev (8/91). And, of course, thumbnail bios of the personalities who played crucial roles, including Walesa, Jaruzelski, Gorbachev, and Yeltsin. All this against the background of a Soviet society and economy, enfeebled by decades of centralized planning and consumer deprivation, which were unable to absorb the shock of Gorbachev's perestroika and vision of a revitalized socialism.<br /><br />DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER includes 18 pages of Notes, and a 5-page Bibliography; Dobbs did his homework.<br /><br />This most excellent work is likely to be most appreciated by those post-WWII Baby Boomer's like myself, who grew up under the threat of a Soviet missile strike. (Those under 20 will probably yawn.) We remember the duck-and-cover drills in elementary school, the periodic tests of the town air raid siren, Khrushchev's shoe at the U.N., the Cuban Missile Crisis, bomb shelters, \\"better dead than red\\", the Domino Theory, \\"we will bury you\\", the Red Menace, the Evil Empire, the hammer and sickle on a blood red flag. Watching on TV the collapse of the Berlin Wall was, for me, the end of an era and a catharsis. My God, we'd \\"won\\".<br /><br />Nowadays, those that would destroy skyscrapers, embassies, troop convoys, bus stops, and underground trains are anonymous and stateless.

Perhaps Stephen King wrote FROM A BUICK 8 after gagging on too many installments of the way-too-cute HERBIE THE LOVE BUG film series.<br /><br />Here, it's 1979 Pennsylvania, and a vintage 1954 Buick Roadmaster in pristine condition is left behind at a rural gas station by a sinister man dressed in black, who subsequently disappears. Troop D of the State Police is called to investigate, and, while it never finds the man in black, its officers discover that the Buick is exceedingly curious. For one, the car is self-cleaning; dirt doesn't stick. For another, it's incapable of running: there are no battery cables, generator, alternator, distributor, or distributor cap; the control knobs on the dash aren't functional; the steering wheel doesn't turn. Anyway, Troop D impounds the vehicle, locks it in a shed, and keeps it the Troop's private secret. But the Buick isn't quiescent. Periodically it drops the temperature in the shed, erupts into a fiery display of violet light, and spits otherworldy plants and creatures out of the trunk, which decompose and die in a matter of minutes. Occasionally, test animals and insects left in the shed disappear - as did Trooper Ennis Rafferty. Trooper Curtis Wilcox becomes obsessed with the nature of the Buick. After Curtis is killed in 2001 by a drunk driver, his teenage son Ned becomes the Troop's mascot, so to speak. The plot of FROM A BUICK 8 cycles back and forth from \\"then\\" to \\"now\\", as Ned is told the story of the Buick, still isolated and perfect in its shed, and his father's obsession.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this book is the length - it's a long short story or novella run amok to 351 pages. Though King throws out enough weirdness every once in awhile to perhaps keep the reader interested, I got the impression that he (or his publisher) just prolonged a mediocre storyline to justify its publication as a full length novel, with a novel's exorbitant cover price. (I bought it used on the cheap from a third party seller. Neener, neener, neeeener!) In any case, FROM A BUICK 8 lurches along to a relatively unsatisfyng ending that I began to anticipate halfway though the book, when it became difficult to summon the interest and energy to continue reading. The dodgy Buick might just as well have been a haunted PortaLoo or microwave oven for all I finally cared. After all, both have doors that creepy things can pop out of unsuspected.<br /><br />If you're a speed reader and can finish this novel at one sitting - say, on a cross-country flight - then it may be better than the over-edited in-flight movie or the dog-eared airline mag in the seat pocket. Otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it.neeeener!)

But his bad luck resulted in his capture by American troops and incarceration at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where for many months he successfully maintained the cover of being a simple taxi diver caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Finally, released as a PR gesture and returned to Afghanistan under guard, Caleb escapes before he can be handed over to the Afghani Security Service, and immediately starts the long journey to rejoin his Al Qaeda \\"family\\" now holed up in the Rub' al Khali desert of Saudi Arabia, otherwise known as the \\"Empty Quarter\\". Because Caleb is not an Arab, but rather an Outsider, he's to be given a special mission.<br /><br />There is little in the way of \\"thriller\\" in THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER, a variance from the usual Gerald Seymour novel that may put off some of his fans. Rather, this novel resembles those penned by John le Carre in that it's relatively heavy on character development (Caleb's) and the sometimes plodding nature of intelligence work, and short on sustained action. Indeed, most of the plot involves Caleb's torturous camel journey across the searing hot Empty Quarter in the company of three other Al Qaeda foot soldiers, a Bedouin guide, and the latter's young son - all dedicated to delivering their precious charge to the organization's remote HQ. The opposition is represented by Marty and Lizzy-Jo, two young CIA operatives searching the Rub' al Khali for evidence of terrorists with cameras mounted on the remotely-controlled Predator drones they fly out of a remote desert base, Juan Gonsalves, the CIA's Riyadh station chief, Juan's MI6 counterpart, Eddie Wroughton, who finds himself on the short end of the Anglo-American \\"special relationship\\", and Jed Dietrich, Caleb's Defense Intelligence Agency interrogator back in Gitmo. Jed was on vacation when the CIA and the FBI decided to cut Caleb loose, and now, after belatedly winkling out a clue as to the taxi driver's true identity, Jed is determined to rectify that mistake regardless of the peril to his career by being the bearer of bad news to his superiors.<br /><br />I'm awarding THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER four stars because I've long been an admirer of the le Carre style, which eschews sensationalism. However, in consciously or unconsciously emulating le Carre, Seymour has done something I've not seen in any of his other books, i.e., leave a glaring loose end that would seem to invite a sequel. But, since that's not been the author's style to date, I fear I'm left here with a book that has a somewhat unsatisfying ending. In all other respects, however, THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER is vintage Seymour in that it contains real-world characters engaged in a struggle that results in a Pyrrhic victory, if indeed victory is achieved at all.CIA and the FBI decided to cut Caleb loose, and now, after belatedly winkling out a clue as to the taxi driver's true identity, Jed is determined to rectify that mistake regardless of the peril to his career by being the bearer of bad news to his superiors.

Of seed of rocket, cumin, pepper, and seed of purslain, being bruised and made up with honey, let him take it morning and evening. It is incomparable.\\"<br /><br />Who needs the expense of Viagra?<br /><br />In ROBBING THE BEES, author Holley Bishop, herself an amateur bee keeper for six years, has penned an eminently readable and loving tribute to bees, honey, and beeswax. While not a thriller, nor perhaps one you can't put down, it is at the top of the genre of books that teaches us a little bit about the world we inhabit, and which focuses on a subject about which the reader likely gives little thought. I mean, honey is on the supermarket shelf in those cute, squeezable, plastic bears. What more is there to know, right?<br /><br />A relatively small portion of the text - regrettably too little - describes Bishop's own experience raising bees. Rather, she was invited by Florida bee keeper and honey merchant, Donald Smiley, to accompany him on his daily rounds over the course of a year as he moved his apiaries from place to place following the seasonal emergence of the various blossoms that provide the pollen and nectar that nourish the bees' hive and ultimately provide Mankind with one of its most historically significant food staples. Also, we learn that, over the millennia, honey has also served as drink, food preservative, money, and medicine. Thus, the quote from a 1685 Persian medical manual that heads this review.<br /><br />Bishop doesn't neglect beeswax, which has served to embalm bodies, provide light as candles, waterproof leather armor, polish furniture, floors and walls, mend cracked pottery, cement mosaic tiles, remove stains from marble, and serve as the substrate for lipstick and crayons.<br /><br />As for the bees themselves, Holly describes their life cycle and hive environment, their amazing ability for comb construction, and their accidental but vital contribution to plant pollination (without which supermarket produce sections wouldn't be the same).<br /><br />In short, because ROBBING THE BEES is a masterpiece of good press, I'll never look at that busy insect in the same way ever again.

The suspect is cat burglar extraordinaire, disgraced former CIA agent Tom Kirk. But murders and circumstance soon indicate that the real menace comes from a mysterious figure in the art underworld known only as Cassius. This fast-paced thriller takes Jennifer and Tom from London to Paris to Istanbul towards a final violent confrontation with unsuspected treachery in the shadow of Napoleon's tomb.\\"<br /><br />I immediately sensed the plot's predictability when, six paragraphs into the readers' introduction to Browne, the latter is described, when changing her blouse, as:<br /><br />\\"... strikingly beautiful in that effortless, double-take way that some women are. ... slender yet curving where it counted, rounded cheeks and curly black that just kissed her bare shoulders. ... the Tiffany's twisted heart necklace ... nestled in the smooth curve of her breasts.\\"<br /><br />Gee, doesn't the FBI employ any Plain Jane, or just downright frumpy, female agents? Should we start a readers' pool to guess the page on which Browne the Babe beds the dashing Kirk? And, in a milieu of deja vu, it wasn't long before I correctly suspected the identity of Cassius.<br /><br />Author James Twining carries the plot by inserting his two attractive protagonists into dodgy situations in exotic and esoteric locales. He tried too hard with a crucial scene involving a backgammon match in Istanbul's Ilesam Lokali tea gardens. If, like me, you know nothing about the game, a full four pages of narrative are rendered essentially incomprehensible.<br /><br />At one point, Kirk steals a Faberge egg and I flashbacked to having seen Tom Cruise employ a similar modus operandi in one of his MISSION IMPOSSIBLE movies. Why, in a screen adaptation of this novel, Cruise could play Kirk to Angelina Jolie's Jennifer.<br /><br />Mind you, THE DOUBLE EAGLE isn't a complete waste of time, especially if you're rushing to board a plane and you stop to indiscriminantly grab a B-thriller off a shelf of B-thrillers in the airport bookshop.

First, the author must have the chutzpah to put him/herself at the center of the universe and think that anyone else would care. Second, the writer rightly or wrongly must think that he/she has done or experienced anything of more than average interest, or, if not, at least make it all sound terribly engaging. Some memoirists - and I don't read many - have managed to pull it off with a charming elan: Doris Kearns Goodwin (WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR), Laura Shaine Cunningham (SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS), Susan Allen Toth (BLOOMING).<br /><br />After losing both his parents - Dad first - to cancer within several weeks of each other, author Dave Eggers, in his early twenties, moved himself and his eleven year-old brother Toph to the California Bay area from their family home in Lake Forest, IL. A sister, Beth, joined them, but lived separately. An older brother, Bill, relocated from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles. A HEARTBREAKING WORK OF STAGGERING GENIUS (AHWoSG) is Dave's narrative, told in the first person, of the 3-year period from his Mom's deathwatch to Toph's high school eligibility. In between, Dave struggles to be both parents to his younger sibling, create an idealistic new world order while on the staff of the Generation X magazine \\"Might\\", and come to terms with the loss of his mother, with whom he had a love/hate relationship, and the guilt stemming from the fact that her body wasn't given a proper burial, but rather donated for medical school dissection. The father isn't given much press at all; he seems to have just been hated.<br /><br />The rational part of me is the first to admit that this is a exceptional piece of writing. Egger's bares his inner thoughts and emotional turmoil with skill and occasional humor. Indeed, when he takes an evening for himself and leaves Toph in the care of a male babysitter, Dave's stream of visions from an over-active imagination, by which he conjures up the gruesome and diabolical atrocities that the sitter may be visiting on Toph while Big Brother is out having a good time, are almost worth the price of the book. However, as a whole, AHWoSG was, for me, only intermittently interesting, and therefore, on the flip side, also intermittently boring. I never cared about Dave or Toph as individuals, and the book's last extended paragraph made me actually wonder if the author might have serious issues with an inner rage that require therapy before he goes nuts with an automatic weapon. Dave isn't a guy I'd care to hang out with; he's too tightly wound.<br /><br />Female readers may find Dave and his extraordinary devotion to his younger brother enormously appealing, just as they might be attracted to an otherwise dysfunctional man and his Golden Lab. My advice would be to cuddle the dog and leave its master on the stoop.<br /><br />AHWoSG is a book worth reading on the chance that you, as so many apparently have, may love it. I would strongly agree, however, with the author's statement in \\"Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book\\" that the embarking reader totally skip the Preface and Acknowledgments sections.abolical atrocities that the sitter may be visiting on Toph while Big Brother is out having a good time, are almost worth the price of the book.

This single incident perhaps best reflects the insecurities of the seventy writer-contributors to this volume, which is mostly about their humiliations suffered at various book signings, book fairs, and readings.<br /><br />MORTIFICATION is essentially a collection of very personal very short stories. Like any anthology, it's difficult to generally rate because the individual chapters vary so widely in content, style, and appeal. Here, they range from 1 star to perhaps 4.5, with the majority at or above 3.<br /><br />My least favorite came from John Burnside, who categorized mortification into Mild and Persistent forms, and a Virulent Strain. His definitions for the three were perhaps based on personal experience, but they didn't have that ring, so he may have missed the point of the book.<br /><br />Personally, I most enjoyed those stories of humiliation submitted by David Harsent and Andrew Motion. The former, a poet, relates attending a bookshop reading with three other writers of the genre. Harsent attends so drunk that he falls asleep on stage, then loudly projectile vomits in the shop loo within the audience's hearing. Motion's gaffe occurred while a lecturer of English at the University of Hull. Andrew organizes a university poetry reading, and takes upon himself the task of picking up at the train station one of the invited writers, whom he hopes to recognize based solely on a photograph. In short, he picks up the wrong woman, who compounds the debacle by playing along with the error in order to get a free lunch.<br /><br />Editor Robin Robertson saves for last the profound mortification - profound certainly on anyone's list - of Niall Griffiths, who relates waking up with a raging erection brought on by partaking too freely in powdered stimulants the night before. The humiliation lies not in the tumescent condition itself, but what happens when Griffiths relieves the situation to a woman's magazine article entitled \\"You Too Can Have A Bum Like Kylie's\\", complete with photos. The \\"Kylie\\" is presumably the gorgeous Australian actress/singer Kylie Minogue. In any case, Niall definitely states that he was scarred for life.<br /><br />The lesson learned in MORTIFICATION is that writers have feelings like the rest of us mortals. Perhaps I should leave off writing book reviews for fear of offending vulnerable sensitivities. ..........

Why isn't immediately apparent. Maybe they'd encountered a snippy foreign exchange teller on their last visit to The City. To work out the details, they employ a mysterious killer-for-hire named Egan, who coerces a former IRA bombmaker, Andrea Hayes, to construct the explosive device by kidnapping her young daughter, Katie. In the bad old days, Andrea specialized in fertilizer bombs, but gave up that line of work after accidently killing four young boys and maiming a fifth. For years, she's lived with her husband, Martin, who knows nothing of her past.<br /><br />THE BOMBMAKER is such a first rate knuckle-biter that the unspecified reason for the plot, though eventually revealed, recedes into the background and the reader is left to fear for Katie in her basement prison, to empathize with Andrea confronting the repercussions of past notoriety and four-thousand pounds of smelly Bandini, and sympathize with Martin left alone, frantic, and without a clue. And it only gets better when MI5 finally gets dropped into the plot's mix.<br /><br />The high-tension ending should leave even the most jaded of thriller readers satisfied. Oddly, however, it's spunky Katie's last act that prompted me to award 5 stars, even though she's given relatively little exposure in the overall story. Because of her, I ended up liking this book enormously. Cross my heart and swear to die.	2005-08-14

In November, author Janet Evanovich apparently launched a new heroine with METRO GIRL, a book I investigated and decided I had no interest in reading. I thought perhaps Evanovich was done with Stephanie. But either I was wrong, or Janet came to her financial senses. In any case, Plum has returned in ELEVEN ON TOP. I admit it; I'm hooked for life on this trashy series.<br /><br />Thirty seconds into ELEVEN, Stephanie quits her job as a bond enforcement agent working for her cousin Vinnie in Trenton, NJ. True to form, however, brief gigs in the local button factory, Kan Klean Dry Cleaners, and Cluck-in-a-Bucket just don't work out. And it shouldn't be a surprise to any series aficionado when Cluck-in-a-Bucket goes up in flames while Stephanie is on duty.<br /><br />Everything Plum fans have come to love about Stephanie's personal and public comic misadventures are present in ELEVEN in satisfying excess: explosions, fires, accumulating corpses, tumbles into messy organic debris, and her dysfunctional relationships with Trenton cop Joe Morelli and the hottie Ranger.<br /><br />Yeah, it's incredibly sophomoric, but great fun. And Plum reveals a new side to her personality when she attempts to quit sugar intake cold turkey. Indeed, the man in Stephanie's life witness to her to voluntary abstention from cookies and donuts had better have the sexual stamina of an eighteen year old. A Plum Assignment if you ask me. Is Morelli up to the task, you think?<br /><br />I'm perhaps overreacting with five stars. But I'm just so ecstatic that Stephanie is back. I only wish that Evanovich would sign a Hollywood picture deal with Sandra Bullock in the lead role. Janet, work with me here, will ya! It would be a box office hit!	2005-08-14

The fact that Newt's GETTYSBURG is fiction makes it all the more remarkable.<br /><br />History has it that on Day 1 of the Gettysburg battle the vanguard of Bobbie Lee's Army of Northern Virginia drove lead elements of George Meade's Army of the Potomac from Gettysburg, the latter digging in on the hills and ridgeline south of the town. Lee's blood was up, and spent the next two days futilely attempting to take those heights against the advice of his chief lieutenant, General Longstreet, who advocated a flanking maneuver around the Union left. In GETTYSBURG, Lee not only bows to Longstreet's counsel, but goes one step further, sending his army on a wide right sweep into Meade's rear to capture the Union Army's supply base at Westminster and cut the Army of the Potomac off from Washington, DC. What results is the apocalyptic Battle of Union Mills on July 4.<br /><br />There are two things that make this novel so darn good. First, the characters of the commanders on both sides - Lee, Meade, Longstreet, Hancock, Sickles, Ewell, Heth, Hunt, Haupt, Sedgewick, Hood, Pickett, Armistead - and my own personal favorite, Colonel Joshua Chamberlain of the 20th Maine, seem to remain true to reality, or at least true to my perceptions of them gained as a casual student of Civil War history. Second, I suggest that you'll find no better description of battlefield conditions and the horrors of Civil War combat than that found here.<br /><br />There are two further volumes to this series, GRANT COMES EAST and NEVER CALL RETREAT. I intend to purchase both immediately and deliciously anticipate losing myself within their pages. I only regret that I'll have to put the books down occasionally to attend to life's relatively mundane daily activities.<br /><br />I'd award GETTYSBURG more than 5 stars if I could; it's off the scale.ound here.

With that image in mind, PARIS 1919 becomes all that more amazing; you couldn't make up a story of an endeavor the success of which was so likely improbable.<br /><br />Margaret MacMillan's historical narrative is a richly detailed masterpiece of popular history in which she deftly teases apart the plethora of problems facing the World War I victors - Britain, France, the U.S., Italy, and Japan - that gathered in Paris in the first half of 1919 to craft a treaty to end global war forever and, indeed, construct a new world order. The tasks facing the winners seemed, and sometimes proved to be, insurmountable: the treaties and reparations to be imposed upon the losers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Turkey), the drawing of new national borders in western, central, eastern, and southern Europe, the assignment of mandates in the Middle and Far East, the call for various national plebiscites, and the establishment of the League of Nations. One can only marvel at the chutzpah of those national leaders - principally Wilson, Lloyd George, Clemenceau, and Orlando - who truly believed they could pull it off in the face of the tribal agendas that existed even among themselves.<br /><br />MacMillan's style bears some similarity to that of Barbara Tuchman, though without the pervasive wry humor. But even Margaret has her giddy moments, as when she recounts:<br /><br />\\" ... (Canadian delegate) Biggar wrote to his wife in Canada, (that) he was having a wonderful time: ... (including) the music halls where he was struck ... by the beauty of the prostitutes. ... When his wife immediately suggested that she come from Canada to join him, Biggar had serious reservations. Of course, he wanted to see her but even now the flats in Paris were terribly expensive, and they had appalling bathrooms. And that he had been told, by a senior politician, that revolution was about to sweep across Germany and possibly into France. There would be serious shortages of food and fuel. The lights would go out, the taps would run dry. 'You must, however, make up your own mind to discomfort with, very remotely, danger.' Mrs. Biggar remained in Canada.\\"<br /><br />Seems like it was a close run thing for Mr. Biggar.<br /><br />PARIS 1919 is supplemented by very useful maps showing the multitude of regions and national boundaries under contention in Europe, Africa, and the Middle and Far East, as well as an extensive photo section, which manages to include most of those in attendance of any great significance to the overall story. There's also a two-page appendix that quotes verbatim Wilson's exercise in idealism, the Fourteen Points.<br /><br />The opinion is widespread that the rise of Hitler and the Second World War had their roots in a vengeful Treaty of Versailles, which, among other odious terms, exacted exorbitant reparation payments from Germany. MacMillan provides evidence that this is an oversimplification, or just plain untrue. Rather, the failure to keep Germany on the straight and narrow in the 20s and 30s stemmed from the indecisiveness of European leaders whose countries had not the wealth, power, or will to do so. Only the United States had the capacity to act, but it had retreated into its isolationist entrenchment.<br /><br />At roughly 500 paperbacked pages, PARIS 1919 is a book not to be completed in a short span of time. Indeed, it took me about 5 weeks, though I admit to taking occasional breathers with more frivolous fare during that period. But MacMillan's excellent volume is worth every penny and minute spent.<br /><br />The decisions made and borders drawn by the peacemakers in Paris in 1919 reverberate down to this day: genocide in the Balkans, Kurdish unrest, conflict between Greece and Turkey, disputed Palestine/Israel. The Deity continues to weep.	2005-07-22

Once in awhile, a story contains within its makeup a deeper meaning and understanding of what it means to be human. Then you have a story worth telling and hearing, one that will stay with you, in one form or another, forever.\\" - Harlan Deveraux<br /><br />PURPLE SUN rises in 1968 at the U.S. Army Supply Depot in Danang, Vietnam. Master Technical Sergeant Isaiah Ross discovers Marine Lance Corporal Billy Kern passed out in a waterlogged ditch outside the perimeter wire. Dragged to Isaiah's tent, the young soldier is cleaned up and fed by the twenty-three year veteran. From Billy, Ross learns that the former has only recently survived a usually fatal bullet wound to the chest suffered during combat in Hue. After this near-death experience, Kern is determined to seek out a holy man, a Buddhist monk, encountered during the Hue fighting. Shortly thereafter, Kern, in pursuit of his quest, is arrested and courtmartialed for unauthorized absence from his unit. At the trial, Ross serves as a character witness, and swears that the boy is fully capable of carrying out his military duties as he perceives them to be. Released, Kern rejoins his troop, only to disappear in a firefight ten days later. The Vietnam War ends with Billy officially MIA, though former Lieutenant Patric Gallo of the \\"Stars and Stripes\\", present at the courtmartial, is convinced he's still alive and wandering rural Vietnam. Ross, since retired to Charleston, SC to open up a florist shop with his wife Miriam, doesn't care. Or, at the very least, maintains Kern is surely dead. Ross also knows, from Billy's First Sergeant, that Kern fatally shot the Hue monk in the chest immediately prior to his own wounding.<br /><br />Twenty-seven pages into PURPLE SUN, the scene shifts to now. Harlan Deveraux, publisher/editor of the \\"Bigwater County Eagle\\" newspaper in rural Sevillia, WY, loans desk space to ex-Lt. Gallo, an itinerant, brooding journalist who's spent his days traveling the world since his discharge from the Army in July '68. Patric has a yarn to tell, and gives it in the form of a journal to Harlan to read. It's this manuscript that forms the core of this book written by Lawrence McAuliffe, and about which the fictional Deveraux makes the observation at the head of this review. And it's the story of the 30-year post-Vietnam relationship between Gallo and Ross that culminates in their journey back to Nam to find Lance Corporal Billy Kern.<br /><br />Author McAullife was himself a Marine lieutenant, who returned to the DMZ in 1968-69 as a military chaplain, and is a disabled veteran of that unfortunate conflict. His PURPLE SUN isn't a thriller by any stretch of the term, nor even, as a mildly compelling mystery, does it have an ending that'll make the reader sit up straight and say \\"Wow!\\" Rather, the book obviously has its wellspring in the deeply personal Vietnam experience of its creator, who, perhaps, has the only perfect understanding of the plot's meaning. The book's conclusion may be likened to that of the great science fiction film, 2001, which was capable of generating endless discussion about what it all meant.<br /><br />With the novel's general underlying themes of duty, responsibility, and redemption, the casual reader looking for entertainment and thrills will likely rate PURPLE SUN no more than 3 stars, perhaps less. The reader with his/her own Vietnam or other combat experience to draw upon, or one who's had a spiritual awakening much like Saul/Paul on the Damascus road, may perhaps award 5. It all depends. For myself, I'm granting four. My curiosity kept me going when I otherwise might have flagged. Ultimately, I recognize PURPLE SUN for being a heartfelt message from the author. Indeed, because of the nature of the ending, I perceive - or perhaps misperceive - in it a clever parable about the relationship of Christianity's God the Father (Isaiah) to God the Son (Billy), a connection unseen even infrequently in mass market paperbacks. In any case, while not ranked as one of the best books I've read in a long time, it is one of the most thought-provoking and conceptually ingenious.God the Son (Billy), a connection unseen even infrequently in mass market paperbacks.

Albany is one of the richest aristocrats in England, and also a dissolute, selfish, old fool. Along for the ride are his wife Constance, six of their fourteen spoiled children, fifteen of nineteen servants, including a cellist and a botanist, an aging parrot named Prince Talleyrand, the staghound Tintamarre, and a gaggle of American talent hired to ease their way, including Toussaint Charbonneau, the guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition many years previous.<br /><br />In FOLLY AND GLORY, it's now three books and almost 4 years later into the saga, and what remains of the Berrybender party is under house arrest by the Mexican government in Santa Fe, now having been there for more than one and a half years. It's been time enough for Tasmin to give birth to twins, Petey and Petal, Bess to deliver Elphinstone, and Vicky to give Lord Albany another son, Randall. But Mexico is expecting trouble in its Texas province, so the central government decides to transfer the troublesome Americans and English in its New Mexico territory overland to Veracruz - a long and dangerous journey, and an opportunity for author Larry McMurtry to kill off superfluous characters so there are fewer lose ends to tie up at the series conclusion. Of the four books, FOLLY AND GLORY is the bloodiest and, if you've grown to care about the central characters, perhaps the most distressing.<br /><br />I'd finally come to be absorbed in the serialized plot by the end of Book Three (BY SORROW'S RIVER), and I was hoping for at least a four-star finish. But, it wasn't to be. After a convulsion of death and killing - separating the wheat from the chafe - the final sixty pages straggle to a contrived and, for me, unsatisfying finale. Perhaps McMurtry had a publisher's deadline to meet, or maybe he just started out with too many characters. I mean, Lord Berrybender dying gloriously with Davy Crockett at the Alamo? Oh, puhleeze!<br /><br />The most interesting persona to be introduced at this late stage is Petal, Tasmin's extraordinarily willful and difficult daughter. It would be amusing to see McMurtry build a new series around her, but I doubt that Larry has that left in him at this point in his writing career, of which LONESOME DOVE is perhaps the undisputed high water mark.<br /><br />The entirety of the Berrybender series was, in retrospect, mildly engaging at best.

Another daughter, Bess, takes up with a Ute brave, High Shoulders, and a third daughter, Mary, loses her virginity to the botanist, Piet Van Wely. Berrybender himself marries the cellist, Vicky Kennet, and gets her with child. And finally, after much aimless wandering in the second book of the series, THE WANDERING HILL, the fecund group is off to Santa Fe accompanied by a ragtag group of mountain men and hangers-on.<br /><br />It's only in this book that the series really takes off for me, mostly due to the fact that its chief protagonist, Tasmin, is becoming engagingly difficult. Increasingly disenchanted with her husband, Tasmin casts lustful looks at Jean Baptiste \\"Pomp\\" Charbonneau, the son of Toussaint Charbonneau and Sacagawea born on Lewis and Clark's epic trek to the Pacific. Moreover, Tasmin has a soft spot in her heart for the young Kit Carson. Trouble is, Pomp has barely a prurient thought in his head, and Kit is too busy becoming a famous scout.<br /><br />What makes BY SORROW'S RIVER particularly interesting are the historical characters that sprinkle the narrative: Carson, the elder and younger Charbonneaus, mountain men Jim Bridger, Hugh Glass, and Tom Fitzpatrick, and traders William and Charles Bent, who established Bent's Fort in present-day Colorado. Having said that, it's because author Larry McMurtry occasionally plays fast and loose with the historical record that I found this fictional narrative unreasonably irritating at times.

At the conclusion of TILT, the more perverse reader might just think: \\"Let it fall over; I'll even help with a shove.\\" Especially if full cover price was paid for the book. Happily, I bought a used copy for a steal, so I entertain no such revisionist thought.<br /><br />TILT is all about the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Well, pretty much. Its 835-year history, including the 197 years it took to build the thing at a stutter start and stop pace, is so intertwined with Pisa itself that the reader gets an abbreviated history of the city's glory days whether one cares much or not. Luckily, TILT is commendably short.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand. Nicholas Shrady's history-Lite of one of the world's most recognizable buildings is not without charm. The author's style is chatty as he ascribes the Tower's origin to the rise of the Pisa city-state in the 11th century when its navy plundered Palermo, the capital of Muslim Sicily, the loot from which raid funded the construction of the cathedral complex into which the Tower later became incorporated commencing in 1173. Then, Pisa's fortunes went into decline in the 1200s as it started squabbling with more powerful rivals - Florence, Genoa, and Venice. Understandably, because of the all the internecine warfare and the Tower's ever increasing tilt, the edifice wasn't completed until 1370.<br /><br />Shrady spends a lot of page space on the life of Galileo, and eventually concludes that his famous experiment, wherein he dropped two different-sized cannonballs from the top of the Tower to demonstrate that objects fall at the same rate regardless of their mass, was a complete fiction created by his admiring disciple, Vincenzo Viviani, since no contemporary record of the event exists.<br /><br />Of course, the Tower's increasing deviation from the vertical is the unifying thread, and the author gleefully points out that some seventeen commissions have been created over the centuries to deal with the problem, only the last of which apparently successfully stabilized the Tower in 1999-2000 by removing dirt from underneath one side of the foundation. Indeed, the book would have interested me more had the author dwelled further on technical aspects and difficulties of that project than on what came before.<br /><br />At 161 paper-backed pages, TILT is a mildly amusing read - with the stress on \\"mildly\\" - suitable for a plane flight of relatively short duration, say Los Angeles to Albuquerque or New York to Atlanta. But, there's no need to carry the book off the aircraft; leave it in the seat pocket with the emergency instructions.he Tower in 1999-2000 by removing dirt from underneath one side of the foundation.

The hero of the film was not Saladin (Ghassan Massoud), but rather Balian (Orlando Bloom), who, as the film opens, is sweating over a hot forge as a sword maker in some dump of a rural French town in the early 1180s. Then, along comes Godfrey (Liam Neeson), a knight and minor noble back from Palestine, who reveals himself as Balian's previously unknown father. Godfrey persuades Balian to take up a sword in defense of the Holy Land. On the return trip, Godfrey dies, but not before knighting his son. Balian subsequently inherits his father's castle of Ibelin within the Kingdom of Jerusalem, becomes chummy with King Baldwin IV and his sister Sibylla (Eva Green), finds himself defending the Holy City almost single-handed against Saladin's horde after the Christian army's disastrous defeat at Hitton, and ultimately returns to France, where he ostensibly lives happily ever after with Sibylla, who now holds the title Queen of Jerusalem. Uh-huh. So, I picked up SALADIN AND THE FALL OF JERUSALEM to find out the real story.<br /><br />Penned in 1898 by Stanley Lane-Poole, this volume is a competent and informative bio of the great Muslim leader, who was respected and praised even by his Crusader foes. Admittedly, the first several chapters dealing with \\"Saladin's world\\", and which describe the Muslim politics of the region and the events of the First Crusade prior to Saladin's birth and rise to power, make for educational, but less than riveting, reading. It's only with Saladin's accession as the Sultan of Egypt in 1171 that his life really becomes interesting as he subsequently labors militarily and politically to unite the Muslim Middle East under one rule, i.e. his, drive the Unbelievers into the sea, and topple the Kingdom of Jerusalem.<br /><br />The book's 19th century roots show even in this 2002 reprint of the original. The occasional map, while certainly not indecipherable, doesn't have the clean look of one of modern construction. More telling, the author infrequently sprinkles the text with passages from original Latin or French sources, which go untranslated. Presumably, the average reader at the turn of the 19th century was more educated and literate than now and could be expected to get along as required in something other than English. This new reprint does, however, include a helpful section of black and white photographs that apparently, because of the presence of automobiles, didn't appear in the first release.<br /><br />The tone of Lane-Poole's narrative is one of detached and uncritical admiration for his hero, as justifiably it should be, since Saladin demonstrated more chivalry, magnanimity, and honor throughout his career than his chief Crusader opponent from June 8, 1191 to October 9, 1192, King Richard I of England. Indeed, the author, who's otherwise adulatory of the Lionheart's prowess in battle, doesn't shirk from recounting Richard's barbarous order to massacre 2,700 Muslims taken prisoner during his capture of Acre, an order that the author terms \\"cruel and cowardly\\", and would today be cause for a war crimes tribunal. Well, so much for the flower of English chivalry.<br /><br />SALADIN AND THE FALL OF JERUSALEM should satisfy a reader such as myself that seeks a general knowledge of Saladin and his accomplishments without getting too obsessive about it.<br /><br />And what of Balian? While he was one of only three knights left after the Battle of Hitton to defend Jerusalem, and who indeed played the key role in the defense of the city and subsequent surrender negotiations with Saladin, Balian had only a relatively small part in the rest of the story - so small that I had to resort to a Web encyclopedia to get more info about the man. What I learned therewas that his saga in THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN was rampant fiction evidently hallucinated by a Hollywood screenwriter in the throes of an illegal substance. Especially that bit about running off with Sybilla. Gee, why doesn't that surprise me?HEAVEN was rampant fiction evidently hallucinated by a Hollywood screenwriter in the throes of an illegal substance.

Luckily for it, the American health-care industry has discovered (or rather invented) just such a disease. It's called 'obesity'.\\"<br /><br />In THE OBESITY MYTH, author/law professor Paul Campos makes an erudite and scathing case against the American diet industry, which, with its paid-lackey researchers and gullible fellow travelers in the medical and government health establishments, directly and simplistically links obesity with disease and generally compromised health. Rather, Campos concludes that the evidence shows that:<br /><br />1. It's more dangerous to be underweight than overweight.<br /><br />2. Health is not improved by long-term weight reduction.<br /><br />3. Health is adversely affected by the yo-yo pattern of weight loss and subsequent regain  experienced by serial dieters.<br /><br />4. The nebulous connection between weight and health disappears when other factors are  considered, e.g. the individual's cardiovascular and metabolic fitness. An overweight fit  person is better off than a thin sedentary person.<br /><br />Rather than being a monotonous, 250-page diatribe against the Fat Police, Campos goes out on a limb in a couple of chapters to make some novel observations. For instance, regarding the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky sleazefest in the chapter \\"The Feeding of the President\\", the author postulates that the entire affair wouldn't have happened if \\"at several crucial junctures in their respective lives, either the fat boy from Hope of the zaftig princess from Beverly Hills had simply been allowed to eat what they wanted to eat.\\" Later, in \\"Anorexia Nervosa and the Spirit of Capitalism\\", Campos asserts that the true anorexic - the perfect dieter endlessly laboring to achieve perfection and salvation, but never satisfied - is the new embodiment of the Puritan work ethic.<br /><br />It would be difficult, I think, for any American that's grown up in our fat-conscious society not to relate to this most excellent volume. At 56, I've never perceived myself as slim or trim, a rather odd admission since, if I look at pictures of myself taken in late elementary and high school, that's what I indeed was; in my first year of college, I had a 29-inch waist. Perhaps my misperception stems from my days as an admittedly chubby 5-8 year old when my Mom would buy me \\"husky boy\\" jeans. Far from being an omniscient observer of something that's never personally affected him, Paul Campos remembers much the same childhood experience, when he was called \\"stocky\\". As an adult, he admits to being a slave to the same cultural imperative for thinness, going so far as to state that his periodic weight losses from \\"overweight\\" come when the women in his life have left him, or hinted they might.<br /><br />In the \\"Conclusion\\", Campos mildly castigates himself for not saying in THE OBESITY MYTH all those things which might have made it better. (For instance, surprising to me, he virtually ignores the current fad for weight loss surgery - stomach stapling and banding.). But he concludes:<br /><br />\\"Yet still, certain things that needed to be said were, in the end, said.\\" Yes, they were. And it was smartly done, too.

Two of my favorite thriller writers are the English authors Gerald Seymour and Stephen Leather. The former impels his heroes, otherwise rather average British citizens, into harm's way in ideological conflicts at the world's grotty margins, and forces them to survive while winning victories that are, at best, Pyrrhic in nature. In Seymour's world, there is no absolute right or wrong, only gray areas, and his characters, like the reader, are carried along by currents more powerful than the individual. In contrast, Leather defines characters that drive the plot and reveal both their good and bad natures in the process. In Leather's thrillers - at least the few I've read to date - the protagonist straddles the line between law-abiding and not, perhaps demonstrating what each of us is capable of if the right pressure is exerted.<br /><br />Here, TANGO ONE, i.e. the individual \\"most wanted\\" by Her majesty's Customs and Excise, is international drug dealer and London resident, Den Donovan. In the book's first 80 pages, which set up the remaining 400, Donovan comes across as a right bloody SOB - capable of orchestrating and filming the torture execution of an undercover agent, and sending the video to C&E as a warning taunt. This event causes Customs and MI6 to recruit as new deep cover agents three young applicants to London's Metropolitan Police - Jamie, Tina and Warren, all of whom have a history of minor criminality that will likely hinder their careers as uniformed officers, but will make them believable members of the underworld as they try to get close to Den and his illegal enterprise. The narrative then jumps ahead three years to when Donovan's 9-year old son, Robbie, catches his mother, Vicky, in bed with Den's accountant, Sharkey. The adulterous pair flee the country to escape Den's wrath, while Robbie moves in with Den's sister and her husband. Donovan now must return to England from overseas, where he's been busy setting up his next big drug deal with the Colombians, to sort out his family problems. On his return, Den discovers that Sharkey also absconded with $60 million of his money - some of which was to be used to pay the Colombians, who don't take kindly to being stiffed. As Den struggles to solve his personal, business, and financial difficulties, he eventually comes into contact with the trio of undercover agents, who surface about halfway through the book.<br /><br />As TANGO ONE begins, the reader might be forgiven for believing that the plot's protagonists will be Jamie, Tina, and Warren. Not so. The novel's \\"hero\\", or at least the character the reader will likely end up cheering on, is Den himself, especially as the trio's MI6 controller ultimately reveals an agenda of his own that would not amuse Her Majesty. Furthermore, as Donovan explains the Game between drug importers and drug enforcement, the former have the opportunity for riches while the latter have the opportunity to advance their careers, and the mass of citizenry in the middle only suffers no matter who wins. So, while Donovan would perhaps not be someone you'd want marrying your daughter, he reveals a human and sometimes quasi-honorable side that goes a long way to ameliorating one's first impression, at least to the point that you might be willing to have a pint with the man.<br /><br />The essence of a Stephen Leather hero is his (or her) capacity for both good and evil. And though a Leather plot invariably has a nice and tidy ending far different from the beguilingly ambiguous conclusion of a Seymour thriller, it's the chameleon-like quality of Stephen's protagonists that places all of his books on my Wish List.to sort out his family problems.

Indeed, as soon as I opened the front cover, seen the extent of the voyage as depicted on two end page maps, and then noted that this small hardcover is only 177 pages long with relatively large print. I mean, if one is sailing from Falmouth in Cornwall across the Celtic Sea to Ireland's southern tip, then back across to Cornwall, north to southwestern Wales, across the Celtic Sea again, up along Ireland's west coast, across to Scotland, up through the Inner and Outer Hebrides, east to the Orkney Islands, and finally ending far to the northwest in the Faeroes, how much description of so many places can be jammed into such a small space? Disappointingly little, if that's what you're looking for.<br /><br />Rather than a travelogue in the traditional sense, SEAMANSHIP is more a ruminative consideration of Sailing Man's relationship to the Sea and his Ship, and, in this volume specifically, Adam's success (or not) in manly bonding with the Auk's skipper, George. Nicolson's philosophical bent is well represented by the following passage:<br /><br />\\"The nature of the voyage is set before you cast off. A sea passage is shaped by the boat's time attached to the land. Every moment at sea is dependent on, and even twinned to, a moment in harbor. What a boat sails on and in is not only the ocean and the wind but the days, weeks, and months tied up alongside.\\"<br /><br />And, using a mixed metaphor:<br /><br />\\"That is why death at sea is such a casual affair. Death has no need to approach ... It doesn't come rolling on like a swell, proceeding grandly towards you with its bosom before it and its intentions clear. Death is already there, a few feet away, resting beneath the table, its head on its paws and a smile in its eyes, happy to accept the scraps that fall.\\"<br /><br />I love the landscape of the British Isles more than any other place on Earth, especially its wild, wave and wind-ravished margins. Here, the author's description of the ancient monastic island off the Irish coast, Skellig Michael, almost brought tears of longing to my eyes. I wanted to visit the place myself - now. But, for me, there wasn't enough of such descriptive power between this book's covers to satisfy a raging wanderlust.<br /><br />SEAMANSHIP is far from being a bad read. Whereas I'm only awarding 3.5 stars (translated to four by an inadequate rating system), one more in tune with Nicolson's lyrical prose will emphatically award five and excoriate me for my shallow obtuseness. This is a book you must read and decide upon for yourself.of the British Isles more than any other place on Earth, especially its wild, wave and wind-ravished margins.

And, yes Meg, then we can clamor like champions, if we have the spittle for it. But it's God's part, not our own, to bring ourselves to such a pass. Our natural business lies in escaping.\\"<br /><br />One of the most endearing qualities of author George MacDonald Fraser's anti-heroic protagonist, Harry Flashman, is his natural cowardice, which he freely admits with a certain degree of pride. Flashy is an expert at escaping; More would have been impressed.<br /><br />In that volume of his memoirs entitled FLASHMAN'S LADY, Flashy is still young in the mid-1840s. His talent for a prudent and precipitous departure has yet to mature, as evidenced by his delayed response when beset by thugs in a dodgy section of Singapore:<br /><br />\\"I'm not proud of what happened in the next moment. Of course, I was very young and thoughtless, and my great days of instant flight and evasion were still ahead of me, but even so, with ... my native cowardice to boot, my reaction was inexcusable ... in my youthful folly and ignorance, I absolutely stood there gaping ...\\"<br /><br />The larger portion of this book's plot involves the kidnapping of Flashy's beautiful but scatterbrained wife, Elspeth, by a certain Don Solomon Haslam, a moneyed and mannered member of English high society who's not what he seems. Harry's determination to stay out of harm's way is severely taxed as he pursues Elspeth's rescue into the pirate-infested interior of Borneo, and later into Madagascar, where Flashy finds himself the slave of that island's mad and despotic queen, Ranavalona.<br /><br />A chief attraction of Fraser's Flashman series is the knowledge it gives the reader about historical and factual, but arcane, events and places. In FLASHMAN'S LADY, the reader is apprised of the private war against the pirates of the East Indies by the eccentric English imperialist, James Brooke, and the reign of terror perpetuated by that female Caligula of the period, Queen Ranavalona I of Madagascar. Indeed, the author's research into the latter has prompted me to place a non-fiction history of the subject on my Wish List.<br /><br />Deep down, I think, Flashy's personal appeal is based on the realization that he's Everyman, whether one would wish to admit it or not. Our natural preference is to escape, and it's only through blundering circumstance, good luck, or an odd quirk of fate that any one of us might, like Harry himself, be perceived a hero by our fellows.MAN'S LADY, the reader is apprised of the private war against the pirates of the East Indies by the eccentric English imperialist, James Brooke, and the reign of terror perpetuated by that female Caligula of the period, Queen Ranavalona I of Madagascar.

Gary Fishgall's GREGORY PECK is an admiring and uncritical look at the actor. Perhaps the only balance is provided by Peck's own words:<br /><br />\\"I've had my ups and downs. There have been times when I wanted to quit. Times when I hit the bottle. Girls. Marital problems. I've touched most of the bases.\\"<br /><br />About those bases, Fishgall is protectively reticent.<br /><br />However, as a Gregory Peck fan all of my adult life, this bio, while not leading me to more than a superficial understanding of the man, is a comprehensive examination of his life as an actor, first in live theater and then in front of the motion picture cameras. The author's progression through the decades of Gregory's career is methodical almost to a fault. A useful section at the end is a filmography of fifty-three feature films and four television appearances, with the availability of each in either videotape and/or DVD format noted. (The list is perhaps somewhat out of date. For example, MACARTHUR's availability is listed as video only, but a DVD edition now exists.)<br /><br />Perhaps the highlights of the book were, for me, the trivia revealed. Did you know that Robert Mitchum (co-starring in CAPE FEAR) has a photographic memory and can learn his lines by reading the script just before a scene is shot? Or that while shooting GUNS OF NAVARONE on Rhodes, where, as one journalist put it, \\"The food is awful, everything shuts up early, and unlike most Greeks, the islanders tether their daughters and let the goats wander free\\", co-star Anthony Quinn kept the stars from dying of boredom with several portable chess sets brought from home? And best of all, the child star (Harvey Stephens) that played Damien in OMEN literally got the part after demonstrating to director Richard Donner a certain demonic streak - he punched Donner in the gonads.<br /><br />Fishgall obviously did a lot of research. On page 260, however, he flatly states that California's incumbent Democratic governor, Edmund Brown, won re-election in 1966. Since actor Ronald Reagan was, in fact, the winner - a victory which catapulted him into national political prominence, and eventually led to his election as President - I found the author's factual failure on this small point to be appalling, and perhaps called into question the accuracy of other material in the book. I mean, I wouldn't expect a recent Golden State high school graduate to even know who either Brown or Reagan was, the quality of general education these days being what it is. But should the author of a major, fact-based text make such a gaffe?<br /><br />Despite its shortcomings, GREGORY PECK satisfied my curiosity about the legendary actor, and then some; I don't think I need to read further. On that basis, 4 stars is appropriate.Ronald Reagan was, in fact, the winner - a victory which catapulted him into national political prominence, and eventually led to his election as President - I found the author's factual failure on this small point to be appalling, and perhaps called into question the accuracy of other material in the book.

The first book, WHERE THE HELL ARE THE GUNS?, covers the training in Canada and England of Blackburn's unit, the 4th Field Artillery Regiment, from its formation in 1939 to June 1944. The second book, THE GUNS OF NORMANDY, describes the 4th Field's actions in support of the 2nd Division in northern France from early July 1944 to its arrival at the Seine River in late August. This final installment, THE GUNS OF VICTORY, chronicles the advance from the Seine into the Third Reich via the Benelux countries to VE-Day, May 8, 1945.<br /><br />Should you read this series, you will, like me, come away with a heightened and supreme regard for the valor of the Canadian Army from D-Day to the end of the war and the value of massed artillery to the combat efficiency and survival of infantry units. Blackburn's personal account is perhaps the best description of men in modern war that I've ever read. The author's narrative is not a detached one. He brings you along into the mud, cold, rain, fatigue, terror, devastation, and apocalyptic arty barrages of the conflict's leading edge.<br /><br />There are too many excellent passages to enumerate, but I shall give two examples.<br /><br />At one point, Blackburn's observation post is in a Dutch windmill on the very border of Germany. As the Army brass plans the advance into the Reich, the author's vantage point becomes widely heralded as having the best view of the ground to be fought over, and to it, as if on pilgrimage, come the high and low, including Lt.-Gen. Guy Simonds, Commander of 2nd Canadian Corps, and Lt.-Gen. Brian Horrocks, Commander of British XXX Corps. But the interesting perception by Blackburn is the way the various officer ranks used battlefield maps.<br /><br />\\"Corps commanders ... planning the best use of 450,000 men, swept open hands across map boards ... Division commanders and brigade commanders, reviewing the role of their brigades and battalions, stroke their maps with two fingers held together. Then come battalion commanders using a single finger for similar purposes in meetings with company commanders. But when company commanders returned with platoon commanders, maps were marked with razor-sharp pencils.\\"<br /><br />Much later, at a company command post, the author comes upon a Major Stothers and the Company Sgt.-Major opening parcels from home mailed to men already killed, the contents distributed to the survivors, and enclosed letters put into a pile.<br /><br />\\"(Stothers) hands one across the table to you without comment. It is a hand-written note of only a few lines: 'Dear Son, the papers tell us that it is very wet where the Canadians are fighting now. So please, Dear, always be sure to wear your rubbers and keep your feet dry.' When you look up at Stothers, he tells you that her boy is the one lying dead outside the back door, face-up in the rain.\\"<br /><br />As the war's end approached, Blackburn had the reputation of being the longest surviving FOO in the Canadian Army, and 4th Field gunners, not without affection, had a pool going, the money to be won by the man who correctly predicted when the Baker Troop FOO (Blackburn) \\"got it\\". Lucky for us, George survived to pen his memoirs. By the end of the third book, I can even forgive him for writing in the second person, a quirk that, in WHERE THE HELL ARE THE GUNS?, almost put me off. But, in no one of the volumes, in the photo section of each, did the author include a wartime picture of himself. That's the only deficiency in an otherwise superb literary accomplishment.<br /><br />To George, who recently celebrated his 88th birthday on February 3rd, and his comrades-in-arms, living and dead, highest honor is due.<br /><br />Note: George Blackburn, through his son Mark, personally sent me all three of his books. Thank you, Sir.t me all three of his books. Thank you, Sir.	2005-05-06
273796:US	53075086	R1EKIPCVGDLQ2B	0595326005	284863340	China Diaries: A novel	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Some interesting history buried in chafe	OK, so let's say I'd an interest in both the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz space mission and the murder of millions of Cambodians by Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge in the mid-70s, and had the dubious idea of writing a novel incorporating the two topics. How would I go about stitching these two wildly disparate themes together?<br /><br />In CHINA DIARIES, author Louis Stannard's intent is to educate the reader about Pan American's trans-Pacific service to the Orient via its China Clipper flying boats in the latter half of the 1930s, as well as to lay bare the barbarisms perpetuated by the Japanese military against the Chinese of Nanking between December 1937 and March 1938.<br /><br />This book's timeline, straightened out by me for simplicity's sake, begins in Shanghai in 1936, where 18-year old Anna Boreisha lives with her parents, members of the Russian aristocracy forced to flee their country by the Bolshevik Revolution and now living in China as undocumented expatriates. Anna gets a job with the Chinese National Airline Corporation (CNAC), a Pan Am subsidiary. As the Japanese invade China in the mid-1930s, Anna witnesses first hand the invader's horrific Rape of Nanking. The young woman escapes, washing up, still employed with CNAC, in Hong Kong, where she meets Pan American Second Officer Alex Cannon. The two are married on December 8th during the initial stages of the Japanese assault on the Crown Colony, and a day after Pearl Harbor. Alex decides to take his new wife back to the States, and they flee by flying west to New York on a China Clipper marooned in Asia by the war's outbreak. Back in America, Anna soon gives birth to a son, Stephen, whom she immediately leaves behind with her in-laws to return to Southeast Asia to be near Alex, now flying military supplies over The Hump, and to try and extricate her parents from Shanghai. Anna disappears in China in 1942. Conveniently, Anna is a dedicated diarist, and she leaves journals scattered all over the world, and which serve to tie the plot together.<br /><br />Stannard's timeline is overly complex. He begins his story in 1994 with an adult Stephen Cannon, a pilot with Trans Artic Airlines. Stephen has his mother's diaries from late 1941 to just prior to her disappearance. In New York, he's contacted by a young Chinese student whose great-uncle, just escaped from Red China, once facilitated Anna's escape from Nanking, and who claims has more of her journals. As Stephen wings his way to Hong Kong to meet the old man, the author switches to late 1941 and relates the love story and freedom flight to the US of Anna and Alex. Then, switching back to 1994, Stephen collects Anna's diaries from 1936 to 1938, to which time Stannard returns with Anna's story for that period. Then, jumping forward again to 1994, Stephen discovers yet more of his mother's journals written after her \\"disappearance\\", as well as witnesses to her activities immediately prior, and the storyline ends with those events. All the while in the 1994 \\"present\\", Stephen is menaced by agents of an ultra-nationalist Japanese organization wishing to suppress evidence of the Nanking atrocities.<br /><br />CHINA DIARIES was not a book I couldn't put down. As a matter of fact, it was So Not A Book I Couldn't Put Down, that I did just that to read another trashy novel that was much more engaging.<br /><br />Though CHINA DIARIES is occasionally interesting to the extent that it describes Pan Am's Clipper operations and the Japanese Army's capture and occupation of Nanking, the book has significant problems. First, it's way too convoluted; a straightforward plot evolution focusing on Anna from 1936 to 1943, intersecting with Alex and Pan Am as a subcharacter and subplot respectively, would've better served. The 1994 \\"present\\" with Stephen was entirely unnecessary, in my opinion. Most damaging, however, was the cookie-cutter sameness of all the characters, and a plot that positively dragged between the occasional interesting bits. Letme explain the former by digressing for just a paragraph to make an analogy...<br /><br />John Wayne was one of Hollywood's greatest entertainers, but he was a lousy actor.

(Solomon) reckoned that sitting in a car with an Albanian pimp, his bodyguard and two heavily armed Croatian thugs on he way to a shoot-out in a Bosnian brothel would make anyone nervous.\\"<br /><br />Such is the approaching moment of truth for Jack Solomon, an investigator employed with the International War-dead Commission in the Balkans. Jack's job is to coordinate the identification by DNA of the bodies of civilians killed in the ethnic cleansing atrocities in Kosovo and Bosnia, and then notify surviving family members. Jack's latest case involves twenty-six Bosnian Muslims - men, women and children from the same extended family - found locked in the back of a refrigerator truck at the bottom of a lake. Death had been by suffocation some three years previous. But the chill of the lake had preserved the bodies perfectly, and Solomon takes the presence among the dead of an eighteen-month old girl, still clutching her teddy bear, hard. Further investigation indicates that one member of the clan survived, sixteen-year old Nicoletta. Jack's self-imposed mission is to track her down so she can testify before the War Crimes Tribunal. But the girl has run, apparently disappearing into the dark world of indentured prostitution. After Jack runs afoul of one of the region's most vicious and powerful criminal bosses, his boss sends him back to the safety of London, where, as chance would have it, Nicoletta is now an escort agency hooker.<br /><br />THE EYEWITNESS is a fascinating look at the callous, and sometimes appallingly vicious, business of international trafficking in prostitutes. Author Stephen Leather's description of the London sex-for-money scene, from the girls working out of the traditional Soho walk-ups to the burgeoning Web-based outcall/incall enterprises, is comprehensive. Research in depth, I'd say.<br /><br />While Solomon is undeniably the Good Guy in this thriller, and there are also Bad Guys depraved enough to make your skin crawl, perhaps some of the most interesting characters are those falling somewhere in between in the most unexpected ways. Indeed, there's a plot twist at the end that was completely unexpected.<br /><br />In the Acknowledgements, Leather thanks working girls \\"Angela, Francesca, Jessica, Kim and Sophie\\" for their insights into the flesh trade. Perhaps it's from them that one of the author's characters, Inga, leaves us the message:<br /><br />\\"I chose this life. I wasn't forced into it ...

Geeks dedicated to inanimate interests will perhaps be left behind on the ground.<br /><br />A naturalist and ecologist, Tennant appears to have a working knowledge of many things rather than being an expert in any one. Here, the author's fascination is with peregrine falcons, including one he named Amelia:<br /><br />\\"... from the first what had crystallized Amelia in my heart was her invisible drive, her all-encompassing quest for home ... It was the grail I had sought long ago, on the prairie marshes of my boyhood - a time when I'd had no real home and had longed to join the cranes, join the geese, join every hawk and skittering shorebird whose breast burned with the power of return to the distant harbors I also sought.\\"<br /><br />Published in 2004, ON THE WING is a narrative of events in the 1980s when Tennant, peripherally involved with a U.S. Army project to identify with radio beacons the migration routes of peregrine falcons, gets infected with the tracking bug big time. Teaming up with an aging, World War II combat flight instructor, George Voss, and the latter's single-engine Cessna Skyhawk, Alan bands a beacon to Amelia and follows her in the air from the Texas coast northward along the spine of the Rockies into Canada before she passes beyond existing airplane landing strips to disappear into her summer home, the Alaskan tundra. Some months later, Tennant, Voss, and the Skyhawk follow three banded falcons - Delgada, Gorda, and Anukiat - south towards their winter home in Central and South America. In between, the author describes time he spent in Alaska observing nesting falcons, coping with the ever-present mosquitos and mud, and avoiding grizzly bears. About the mosquitos, he writes:<br /><br />\\"In the mornings ... battalions coated my breakfast cereal. Scraping them off only allowed new hordes to fling themselves onto the path I'd just shaved with my spoon, and eventually I simply shoveled down their hairy ranks along with the underlying oats.\\" Hmm, perhaps the product development division of Kellogg's should take note of a promising new product line.<br /><br />The narrative achieves considerable charm and intellectual interest as the author occasionally branches out into a variety of subjects: the history of falconry, the hunting practices of polar bears, the dangers posed by the environmental pollutants DDT, paraquat - both defoliants - and polychlorinated biphenyls, the depredations of the evil petrochemical companies in Mexico and Alaska's Artic Slope, and the rise and fall of the Mayan city Xunantunich. And then there are the close calls with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Central American drug runners, and two British RAF Harrier jets.<br /><br />I'm not awarding five stars because Tennant's fixation ultimately gets tiresome. Alan's mania even takes a toll on his personal life, as he candidly admits. At forty-six years of age, the author has an on-again, off-again relationship with Jennifer, a liaison that suffers because he's not willing to give up gallivanting around the continent and spend time at home. Perhaps a bigger problem is that the author demonstrates very little in the way of a self-deprecating sense of humor; he takes himself and his new hobby way too seriously. By the time Tennat and Voss get to Guatemala, I just wanted to say, \\"Get a life!\\"<br /><br />After reading ON THE WING, or perhaps instead of reading it, I recommend seeing the extraordinary and visually stunning 2001 documentary, WINGED MIGRATION, released on DVD in 2003.he path I'd just shaved with my spoon, and eventually I simply shoveled down their hairy ranks along with the underlying oats.\\" Hmm, perhaps the product development division of Kellogg's should take note of a promising new product line. <br /> <br />The narrative achieves considerable charm and intellectual interest as the author occasionally branches out into a variety of subjects: the history of falconry, the hunting practices of polar bears, the dangers posed by the environmental pollutants DDT, paraquat - both defoliants - and polychlorinated biphenyls, the depredations of the evil petrochemical companies in Mexico and Alaska's Artic Slope, and the rise and fall of the Mayan city Xunantunich.

You know, compared to the Hollywood version, the real Rome is a dump. Maybe it's just because I didn't have Audrey Hepburn on my arm. In THE SEX LIVES OF CANNIBALS, I gather that author J. Maarten Troost's collision with the South Seas reality of \\"tropical paradise\\" was somewhat similar.<br /><br />In mid-1990's, Troost follows his girlfriend Sylvia to Tarawa, capital of the Equatorial Pacific country of Kiribati, otherwise known as the Gilbert Islands. Kiribati, comprising 33 islands roughly the area of greater Baltimore, is spread over an expanse of water the size of the United States. Sylvia had gotten a job as the new country director of the FSP (Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific), a do-gooder organization working out of Washington, DC. Maarten and Sylvia lived on Tarawa, specifically South Tarawa, for two years.<br /><br />Troost has the humorous style reminiscent of another of my favorite travel essayists, Pete McCarthy. It has bite, as when Marteen describes the shenanigans of Kiribati government officials:<br /><br />\\"As far as I could tell, the government spends a lot of time drinking and brawling. No workshop on global climate change is complete until the assistant secretary of the environment has passed out in a pool of beer barf ...\\"<br /><br />And sometimes, he's right on, as when he mulls the fate of History in the United States:<br /><br />\\" ... history is largely paved over, abandoned, and relegated to textbooks so shockingly dull that they could only have been written by politically correct creationists whose sole objective was to offend no one.\\" Hear, hear!<br /><br />Troost is also not above wry self-deprecation, as when he introduces himself to an island group according in the Kiribati tradition:<br /><br />\\"Maarten, son of Herman of Holland, had a medieval ring. True, it wasn't as evocative as say Vlad the Impaler, but still, Maarten, son of Herman of Holland, suggested trouble.\\"<br /><br />Troost learns early on that Tarawa, the site of the bloody WWII assault by the Second Marine Division on the occupying Japanese garrison, is no tropical paradise. True, there are the glorious sunsets, crystal clear lagoons, and the achingly radiant colors of ocean, sky and palms, but there are also the feces-strewn beaches, piles of garbage, a monotonous diet (mostly fish), the suffocating heat, bad water, unreliable electrical service, no availability of mainstream print media, wretched airline connections, diseases, intestinal parasites, poor health care, a disinterested government bureaucracy, and, perhaps worst of all, no place to go. Yet, despite all this, Maarten and Sylvia discover a life, or rather a quality and pace of life, more genuine than is found back in the States.  Indeed, two years after returning to Washington from Kiribati, the two return to Oceana - first to Vanuatu, then Fiji - for several years before relocating permanently to the original Land of Make Believe, California.<br /><br />THE SEX LIVES OF CANNIBALS contains no photos of Maarten, Sylvia, or Tarawa, or even a map of the atoll; this is its biggest deficiency. Otherwise, the author entertained me with tales of an exotic place that I shall never find the time to visit. I couldn't ask for more.suggested trouble.\\"     Troost learns early on that Tarawa, the site of the bloody WWII assault by the Second Marine Division on the occupying Japanese garrison, is no tropical paradise.

336751:US	53075086	R1M7Q37FR4VBZQ	0385336675	649745987	The Enemy (Jack Reacher, No. 8)	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	Reacher shelled by tanks and busted one grade	In the previous seven books of the Jack Reacher series, author Lee Child positions his hero in space and time after his release from active duty with the U.S. Army's Military Police. We've gotten to know Jack as a relatively asocial tough guy who wanders the United States attracting big trouble as he helps others cope with assorted villains. Here, in THE ENEMY, we see Reacher in his previous life as an MP officer.<br /><br />It's New Year's Eve 1989, and Major Reacher has only just been yanked off duty in Panama and hurriedly assigned to Fort Bird, North Carolina as the Executive Officer of the post's MP detachment. As the MP Commanding Officer is on leave, Jack is Fort Bird's acting top cop. At the stroke of midnight, Reacher gets a call from the local civilian police saying they've found a dead general in a cheap hotel room. He'd apparently died of a heart attack while entertaining a hooker. The deceased turns out to be General Kramer of XII Armored Corps deployed in Germany. Kramer had been traveling to California for a Big Meeting, and had gone far out of his way from a Washington, DC layover for a night's sleazy good time. Trouble is, the general's briefcase containing the meeting agenda has disappeared, and Jack's duty is to find it. Soon enough, the bodies begin to pile up, mostly of murder victims. And Reacher is pressured from above to stand down from his investigations or be charged himself with one of the killings. But Jack bulls ahead anyway in the trademark Reacher style that his fans have learned to expect.<br /><br />THE ENEMY strikes me as the most complex Reacher thriller to date. Perhaps too complex. Reacher's personality is unadorned. (In a previous book, we learn that he doesn't even know how to fold a shirt.) His rapport with any Bad Guy involves kicking butt. Here, when the Army is faced with the imminent retreat of Soviet forces from East Germany following the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and the service's various disciplines - infantry, armored, special forces, etc. - must now individually engage in skullduggery to ensure its pre-eminence in a revamped, post-Cold War military, the subtleties of the situation perhaps ill-fit Jack's black-and-white, simplistic approach. But, of course, Reacher prevails in his usual manner, thus providing a superficially satisfying read.<br /><br />What causes me to give four stars instead of five is my overreaction to the author's poor research on a couple of points. Towards the end, Reacher must fly to LAX in Los Angeles, then drive to a military base north of Barstow. Jack notes that LAX and Barstow are 30 miles and a 1-hour drive apart. What map was Lee, who lives in New York City, looking at?! The two are more like 150 miles apart, or a 2.5-hour drive on a good day through SoCal traffic. On another occasion, Reacher observes about the Army's promotion ladder:<br /><br />\\"... the ladder stretches all the way up to a five-star General of the Army, although I wasn't aware of anyone except George Washington and Dwight David Eisenhower who ever made it that far.\\"<br /><br />This is a remarkably obtuse statement from someone who attended West Point. While Washington was posthumously appointed by President Ford to forever be the most senior officer in the American Armed Forces, he never achieved higher than the highest rank then existing, i.e. 3-star Lieutenant General. Five-star rank was established by Congress in 1944 to give the most senior American officers equal standing with British, French, and Soviet Field Marshals. Five U.S. Army officers, all of the World War II era, have achieved that exalted status: George Marshall, Douglas MacArthur, Eisenhower, Henry Arnold (of the Army Air Corps), and Omar Bradley. (Four naval officers have also been given a fifth star: Leahy, Nimitz, King, and Halsey.)<br /><br />Despite my reservations about THE ENEMY, Jack Reacher is my favorite literary super-hero, and Child's next book is on my Wish List.rmored, special forces, etc. - must now individually engage in skullduggery to ensure its pre-eminence in a revamped, post-Cold War military, the subtleties of the situation perhaps ill-fit Jack's black-and-white, simplistic approach.

I wanted to lay hands on cobaltite and niccolite, and compounds or minerals of manganese and molybdenum, of uranium and chromium ... I wanted to pulverize them, treat them with acid, roast them, reduce them - whatever was necessary - so I could extract their metals myself.\\"<br /><br />In the life of a pre-pubescent boy, whatever happened to the simple pleasures of sports, chasing girls to pull their pigtails, or playing cowboys and Indians?<br /><br />UNCLE TUNGSTEN is the childhood memoir of Oliver Sacks, who, as the son of two physicians in 1930s and 40s London, adopts more cerebral interests. Actually, let's call them obsessions, e.g., Mendeleev's Table of the Elements:<br /><br />\\"I copied it into my exercise book and carried it everywhere ... I spent hours now, enchanted, totally absorbed, wandering, making discoveries, in the enchanted garden of Mendeleev.\\"<br /><br />Oliver's propensity for intellectual pursuits was further encouraged by his two maternal uncles, Dave and Abe, two scientist/business entrepreneurs, the former nicknamed UNCLE TUNGSTEN for his preoccupation with that element and his process for manufacturing tungsten light bulbs.<br /><br />This engaging and instructive volume is the author's narrative of his life from age 6 to 15, beginning in 1939 at the beginning of WWII, when he was protectively sent out of London to a boarding school. Returning in 1943, he set up his own household lab and began experimenting with a vengeance, his chief interest being metals and their properties. The text is leavened with descriptions of his home life, his parents and brothers, and summaries of the achievements of giants in the field of Chemistry: John Dalton, Robert Boyle, the Curies, Antoine Lavoisier, Dmitri Mendeleev, Ernest Rutherford, Michael Faraday, and others. UNCLE TUNGSTEN is a short, popular history of the science.<br /><br />I'm not awarding 5 stars because obsessions, especially someone else's, can become tiresome. Even Oliver's parents, responsible as any for his scientific curiosity, could be driven to distraction. At one point on a family auto trip, the young Sacks blathers on about one of his favorite elements for twenty minutes in the back seat until his father shouts, \\"Enough about thallium!\\"<br /><br />By the age of 15, Oliver's preoccupation with chemistry began to ebb as the hormones of adolescence began to flow.

I started reading Quiller spy thrillers when I was a teenager, when the Cold War was at its coldest. This final one is, for me, like the rose that Quiller stipulated be sent to his Moira by the Bureau in London in the event of his death in the field.<br /><br />Here, in QUILLER BALALAIKA, the KGB is pass&eacute;. The mission, demanded by the British Prime Minister and controlled by the Bureau's Chief of Signals, the legendary Croder himself, is so high priority that Quiller demands and gets his favorite Director in the Field, Ferris, who must be yanked off a Beijing operation just about to enter a dodgy end phase. But the \\"Balalaika\\" mission is that important - the PM wants neutralized a major figure in the Russian mafiya, Vasyl Sakkas, a British criminal who'd previously escaped one of Her Majesty's prisons after killing two guards, and who's now undermining the struggling Russian economy, and thus the stability of the Yeltsin government, with his rapacious activities.<br /><br />Quiller is a spy's spy, whereas James Bond is a man's or lady's spy depending on his activity of the moment. Quiller is virtually faceless, blending with his environment as needs dictate, whereas 007 is all flash in a tux. Bond relies on gadgets; Quiller relies only on his own physical endurance and natural skills - he doesn't even carry a gun. Bond has ability; Quller has ability AND street smarts. If the two were to go one on one, I'd place my bet on Quiller. The Commander will fraternize with anything that moves, especially if female; Quiller's the ultimate asocial loner. In decades of Quiller thrillers, his only point of caring contact with the rest of the human race is apparently Moira, about whom the reader otherwise knows virtually nothing.<br /><br />The last two chapters of QUILLER BALALAIKA are afterwords by his son, Jean-Pierre, and his wife, Chaille. From them, we understand that the book was written in the last year of Trevor's life as he battled the disease that would ultimately kill him. Indeed, the last paragraphs were transcribed by Jean-Pierre as his father spoke them just three days before he expired.<br /><br />As I age, I'm occasionally saddened by the death of a public figure whose contribution to our world consistently enriched mine through the decades. Based on personal preference, I deeply regret the absence of Gregory Peck, Jimmy Stewart, Audrey Hepburn, Bob Hope, The Big D (ex-Dodger pitcher Don Drysdale), and historian Barbara Tuchman.

I'm taking this opportunity for self-appraisal to try and understand why, for me, it's not.<br /><br />It's a couple of years before Hong Kong is to revert to Red China. Chinese expatriate Anthony Chung meets in Paris with ex-U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Joel Tyler to set in motion plans for the Heist of the Century in Britain's last jewel in the crown. To that end, Tyler implements an elaborate scheme to recruit other U.S. Army vets of the Vietnam war for the venture. He ultimately attracts ex-Huey pilot Dan Lehmen, a phony investments scammer on the run from the Mob, ex-Tunnel Rat Eric Horvitz, a border-line sociopath living alone in the Canadian woods, ex-Huey door gunner Larry Carmody, who left Nam with a chip on his shoulder and minus one forearm, and ex-Huey crew chief Barton Lewis, a lonely divorc&eacute; recently diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer. Then there's ex-Air America, i.e. CIA, chopper pilot Chuck Doherty, who fled a murderous Special Forces operation in Laos, only to stash his Huey in the Thai jungle and live as a Buddhist monk these last twenty-two years.<br /><br />This thriller is intricately constructed with more than the usual amount of character development. There's even a plot twist, although the reader is let into the secret 120 pages before the book's conclusion and it's left only to see how Dan, Eric, Larry, Bart, and Chuck fare before the dust settles.<br /><br />THE VETS is actually a hard book to put down, but I was left with a niggling dissatisfaction. I think it's because there wasn't anybody serving as a protagonist whom I could cheer on from the sidelines, though Lewis perhaps comes the closest. The ultimate beneficiary of the plot is only introduced seven pages before the last, and my reaction was \\"Why should I care?\\" In the meantime during the previous 557 pages, our \\"heroes\\" have shown a willingness to break the law and/or have been instrumental in ruining the lives of people who, if not always likable, are at least innocent bystanders in the conventional sense. Now, mind you, I'm no goody two shoes. If I was starving, I'd forcefully shove into the gutter an 80-year old granny reaching for the world's last slice of pizza. But, that wasn't the case here, and I'm knocking one star off THE VETS for it's lack of a moral lynch pin.ho, if not always likable, are at least innocent bystanders in the conventional sense.

The first book, WHERE THE HELL ARE THE GUNS?, covers the training in Canada and England of Blackburn's unit, the 4th Field Artillery Regiment, from its formation to June 1944. This book, THE GUNS OF NORMANDY, describes the 4th Field's actions in northern France from early July 1944 to its arrival at the Seine River in late August. The final installment, THE GUNS OF VICTORY, chronicles the advance from the Seine into the Third Reich via the Benelux countries.<br /><br />THE GUNS OF NORMANDY is one of the most compelling descriptions of men embroiled in modern land warfare that I've ever read. It gives (over)due credit to the Canadian efforts in the war against Hitler, this effort having been largely ignored in popular history next to those of its British and American allies. As Blackburn states regarding Canadian battle casualties in Normandy:<br /><br />\\"The two infantry divisions (2nd and 3rd) accounted for 78 percent: 7,869 dead, wounded, or missing per division, the highest casualty rate in all fifteen divisions in 21st Army Group.\\" Note: at this time, the 21st British Army Group comprised two of the four allied armies attempting to consolidate their Normandy foothold immediately after the D-Day invasion.<br /><br />Although, late in the book, the author acknowledges the comradeship fostered among the troops of his artillery unit, the 2nd Battery of 4th Field, the reader may not be as mindful of such as compared to its portrayal in, say, BAND OF BROTHERS, the exemplary popular history of a company of 101st Airborne paratroops from D-Day to the war's end, subsequently made into an HBO TV miniseries by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, perhaps the best miniseries produced in the history of television. At times, Blackburn and his fellow GPOs (Gun Position Officer), seem almost like independent operators. Perhaps it's the distracting 2nd person viewpoint (\\"You ...\\") the author employs to describe his own battlefield experiences. I wish Spielberg and Hanks would produce a miniseries on 4th Field's exploits; it would be a visually powerful blockbuster hit. (George, can you land a Hollywood deal?)<br /><br />At times in the narrative, following the complex movements of various artillery, armored, and infantry units across the French terrain is difficult. The author provides a couple of reasonably detailed maps of the principal combat area between Caen and Falaise that help considerably. But Blackburn is at his best when describing the isolated experiences of himself and others interviewed for the history. At one point, exhausted infantry grunts resting alongside a road stand up and cheer a passing arty column, something of a pleasant surprise to the latter, which apparently suffered an inferiority complex relative to the \\"footsloggers\\". At another, a trooper notable for his compulsive attention to personal appearance and hygiene jumps off a vehicle in darkness and lands on, and breaks through, the bloated belly of a dead bovine. Yuk! And definitely my favorite, a liberated French farmer gratefully invites a couple of 4th Field troopers over to the house to have dinner and sleep with his two teenage daughters. (They took the offer. War is hell.) But the reader might be left wondering what the mademoiselles thought.<br /><br />There are two sections of photos that come primarily from government (rather than private) sources, and which mostly depict either equipment (tanks, field guns, transport vehicles) or the devastating damage inflicted on French towns and fleeing German columns. There are absolutely none of the author taken either then or since, a deficiency I deplore as I'd like to put a human face on the words of the man. (George, how about an autographed snap of you in uniform?)<br /><br />The net effect of THE GUNS OF NORMANDY is to emphatically make the point that Canada's forces held the Wehrmacht by the nose in a bitter life or death struggle south of Caen while Georgie Patton's 3rd U.S. Army waltzed all the way to Paris through the lightly defended German left flank. One's opinion of the Canadians' sacrifices and fighting abilities - in the face of enemy action, demoralizing \\"friendly bombing\\" incidents, dysentery, lice, prolonged sleeplessness, poor rations, heat, dust, rain, and mud - must necessarily increase to that nation's profound honor. My  perception of the Normandy struggle has been forever altered.<br /><br />I eagerly anticipate reading THE GUNS OF VICTORY.you in uniform?) <br /> <br />The net effect of THE GUNS OF NORMANDY is to emphatically make the point that Canada's forces held the Wehrmacht by the nose in a bitter life or death struggle south of Caen while Georgie Patton's 3rd U.S. Army waltzed all the way to Paris through the lightly defended German left flank.

His feeling of belonging in the English Midlands having gotten lost somewhere along the way, he searches for his roots and a sense of \\"home\\" in the west of Ireland - a journey of discovery and social commentary as related here in McCARTHY'S BAR, the first of his two books on the joys and angst of an Irish heritage.<br /><br />Whether he's climbing to the top of Ireland's holiest mountain, Croagh Patrick, stopping for a pint at every \\"McCarthy's Bar\\" he stumbles upon, enduring a three-day ordeal of fasting, sleep deprivation and barefoot praying at the country's last remaining place of rigorous religious pilgrimage, St. Patrick's Purgatory at Lough Derg, crashing the touristy medieval banquet at Bunratty Castle, taking the dodgy cable car across treacherous waters to Dursey Island, or seeking out the \\"Ryan's Daughter\\" commemorative stone on the Dingle Peninsula, McCarthy's narrative is a revelatory introduction to Eire's rugged western counties. And, Pete's strength is always his keen eye for and pungent commentary on the absurdities of the local human condition.<br /><br />\\"Outside the church (in Castletownbere) half a dozen shifty-looking men are lurking by the porch, observing their obligation to attend mass, but without actually entering the building and being spotted by the priest ... Hunched and restless, their furtive, well-practiced body language doesn't say 'Church' so much as 'Unemployment Office' or 'Magistrate's Court'. Ireland may be becoming a more secular society, but some deeply ingrained vestige of belief has convinced these guys they're more likely to avoid eternal damnation if they spend an hour every Saturday night having a few smokes outside the church before going out for a skinful. It's a complex business, modern theology.\\"<br /><br />McCarthy and Bill Bryson are my two favorite travel essayists. But whereas the latter's gentle observations are fueled by a certain bemused inquisitiveness, Pete's, though basically benign, seem to be colored by a mild case of indigestion. I can't say that I prefer one over the other; it depends on my mood. Certainly, if McCarthy proves to be as prolific a writer as Bill, then his publisher is assured of my dollars.<br /><br />McCarthy perhaps hit his stride with his second book, THE ROAD TO McCARTHY, to which I awarded five stars. McCARTHY'S BAR seemed a bit forced at times, e.g. in the chapter about the author's travails in St. Patrick's Purgatory. However, as a half-century resident of Southern California, in which place I've never felt entirely comfortable, I can relate to the quote attributed by the author to his friend on Inishmore Island, Father Dara Molloy, a Catholic priest - now married with three children - gone rogue from established Church doctrine:<br /><br />\\"The Celtic monks would wander round Europe until they found the place that was calling to them ... They had an expression for it: seeking their place of resurrection. They believed that they were beneath that spot in the firmament that would one day lead them to heaven.\\"<br /><br />PS: Today, 7/19/05, I received an email from Pete's literary agent that the author died of cancer in October 2004.

Stewart '26 Series)	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	Under the midnight moon	In THE OTHER SIDE OF RUSSIA, the University of Maryland University College has established a joint undergraduate degree program in business management with the Far Eastern State University in Vladivostok and the State University in Irkutsk. In the summer of 1993, author Sharon Hudgins and her husband, Tom, packed off to Siberia and the Russian Far East to serve as teachers in this cooperative venture, while the former was also Maryland's on-site program coordinator in both cities. This book chronicles their experiences from their arrival until their departure in December 1994.<br /><br />Whether she's describing the immensity of pristine Lake Baikal, the problematic living conditions in their high-rise apartment, local customs and food of the Buryat people, the vagaries and perils of shopping for household necessities, maddening water and electricity outages, local festivals, the growing pains of a free-market economy, the university students' learning ethic, or the conviviality and generosity of their Russian friends, Hudgins has a keen eye for small details, as when describing an open air market:<br /><br />\\"An Uzbek woman ... sold raisins and nuts in small paper cones made out of official forms from the Irkutsk Municipal Water Department ... In one part of the market, a pretty teenage girl, wearing a garish, flower-printed dress and a thousand-yard stare, held a handful of peacock feathers and sipped a can of Dr Pepper, while in another section two older women, both drunk, tried to punch each other out in a fist fight.\\"<br /><br />I haven't been so engaged by a travel essay about Russia since Hedrick Smith's 1976 bestseller, THE RUSSIANS. My only criticism is the relative lack of photographs - only a couple at most per chapter. Luckily, Sharon's poetic prose paints pictures almost as effective as snapshots, as this from her vantage point on the Trans-Siberian Railroad:<br /><br />\\"A profusion of wildflowers carpeted the meadows, like an Impressionist painting exuberantly expanding beyond the limits of canvas and frame: undulating shades of yellow, gold, and blue, maroon and magenta, soft pink and pristine white, the pale purple globes of wild onions gone to seed, thousands of red-orange tiger lilies, whole fields of dark purple Siberian irises, and occasionally a single red poppy or two, like a stubborn symbol of politics past. Outside Chita a small lake glistened under the midnight moon.\\"<br /><br />For me, a travel narrative is all it can be if it makes me want to go there myself. THE OTHER SIDE OF RUSSIA accomplishes that. Well, maybe for just a brief visit, perhaps, because I certainly wouldn't want to live there.limits of canvas and frame: undulating shades of yellow, gold, and blue, maroon and magenta, soft pink and pristine white, the pale purple globes of wild onions gone to seed, thousands of red-orange tiger lilies, whole fields of dark purple Siberian irises, and occasionally a single red poppy or two, like a stubborn symbol of politics past.

As long as you keep your business within that framework - keep your nose technically clean, if not morally - you can make a fortune, perfectly legally and safely.\\"<br /><br />In his professional and personal life, Draves isn't so much immoral as amoral. He won't break the law, but will utilize every legal scam in his repertoire to increase his financial worth, now approaching $2 million, which, in Steve's world of 1966, is a fair piece of change. And while Steve deeply loves his wife, Betty, he'll cheat on her any chance he gets. (Blonde Betty, built like a brick outhouse and dumb as a post, is selflessly dedicated to her husband. It's enough to make a radical feminist want to kill.)<br /><br />From past experience, Draves believes his life-changing good luck appears precisely at the end of 5-year cycles. The next is imminent. True, he hasn't had recent success getting to first base with Tina, Sandy, or his secretary, Deby. But, business has been good, though there is that risky association with the hard-nosed mobster, Johnny Patiense. But certainly, after a, um, no-nonsense conference with Johnny's security chief and quality assurance manager, Tony and Frank respectively, Steve's life takes a new direction. Redemption, perhaps.<br /><br />As a fictional framework within which author Jack Payne educates the reader, SIX HOURS PAST THURSDAY is first rate. However, whether the narrative should serve as a how-to-do or how-to-avoid primer of shady business practices, Payne leaves to his audience. Since justice of a sort is served by the book's conclusion, I gather that Payne's preference is that it be the latter.<br /><br />I'd award the book five stars for conceptual cleverness, but only three for plot credibility and the ability of its \\"hero\\" to engage the sympathy of the reader. Indeed, Drave is such an oil slick that I hardly cared what became of him in what was, for me, an overly contrived finale. The readers' sympathies will likely remain with the secondary characters that Steve uses and manipulates, especially the women in his life. This seems to violate what I learned in high school English Lit, i.e., that a necessary component of fiction is a major protagonist for whom one can cheer. But, never mind, SIX HOURS PAST THURSDAY is a worthwhile read for that next flight out of town to close the Big Deal.o-avoid primer of shady business practices, Payne leaves to his audience.

His beloved wife of 51 years died of cancer three years previous. Now, he joylessly trudges from day to day living with her ghost - and the ghosts of his comrades killed in combat against the Nazis when they parachuted into Normandy on D-Day with the 101st Airborne. Oh, and Andrew, the difficult teenage son of his single-parent, dysfunctional daughter, is just pulling up at the curb for a visit.<br /><br />At 16, Andrew is a physically unprepossessing nerd. By his own estimation, he ranks 2,888 out of 3,000 on his high school's social ladder. He's ignored by girls, and bullied by boys. He was recently suspended for pulling a knife on one of his tormentors. Andrew's ghost is that of his best friend Matt, another social outcast, who recently committed suicide. Andrew is tempted to follow.<br /><br />Mead's first impression of Andrew:<br /><br />\\"What a punk, thought Mead, studying his grandson, whose enormous jeans could easily have fit on the biggest man in Mead's old rifle company. He wore dirty, unlaced sneakers ... and a large and rumpled black T-shirt with some sort of Satanic omen painted on it. He had a small, gold hoop earring in his left earlobe and his hair ... looked like it had been cut with shears, then fermented under a helmet for several weeks. In short, the boy looked like a refugee or drug freak.\\"<br /><br />At one point, Andrew shouts at his grandfather:<br /><br />\\"You expect everybody to be like you, don't you? Well, I don't want to be like you! Why would anybody want to be like you? You don't have any friends, you don't do anything all day ... All you've got are your stupid medals and your stupid secret memories about stuff that happened decades ago ... Well, I don't want to turn out like you. I'd rather die.\\"<br /><br />This visit should go well, don't you think?<br /><br />The prose of THE DISTANCE FROM NORMANDY doesn't have the powerful eloquence and elegance of Hull's previous work, LOSING JULIA, which perhaps has the capacity to reduce a sensitive person to tears (see my review dated 4-14-01). However, the strength of author Jonathan Hull's writing is that it poignantly conveys the human condition in general and that of his characters in particular. When, in flashback, Mead remembers for the reader his wartime experiences, one is perhaps reminded of the TV miniseries BAND OF BROTHERS, also about a company of 101st Airborne troopers fighting their way into Hitler's Reich.<br /><br />The crisis in the plot occurs when Mead discovers Andrew with his finger on the trigger of a Luger pistol, one of the former's wartime souvenirs. In a last, desperate effort to put some iron in the boy, Mead takes him for a tour of the Normandy battlefields. And it's there that Mead himself must confront his most implacable and most secret ghost. Only then can he be healed and become a role model for Andrew.<br /><br />As these two crippled lives collided, I thought the bridging of their differences a bit too pat and too tidy for me to award more than four stars. A TV adaptation would be the perfect Sunday night tearjerker, but not represent real life, in which too many loose ends form a ragged edge. But THE DISTANCE FROM NORMANDY is an engaging read, and I look forward to Hull's next offering./> <br />The prose of THE DISTANCE FROM NORMANDY doesn't have the powerful eloquence and elegance of Hull's previous work, LOSING JULIA, which perhaps has the capacity to reduce a sensitive person to tears (see my review dated 4-14-01).

At age 55, I've finally learned something about an American experience that ended two years before I was born. About time, don't you think?<br /><br />NAZI PRISONERS OF WAR IN AMERICA is a concise and (apparently) comprehensive overview, which describes the incarceration of the roughly 375,000 captured members of the German military in 500+ camps and branch camps thoughout the United States from May 1942 to July 1946. The book's eight chapters summarize the process from initial capture and dispatch westward across the Atlantic through repatriation and return to Europe. In between, author Arnold Krammer depicts the general layout of the camps, the life behind barbed wire, the work and re-education programs, the escapes, and the ideological tensions between the ardently Nazi minority and non-Nazi majority that generally resulted in internal control of a camp's inmate population by the former prisoner group. Each chapter has a 4 to 8 page photo section relevant to its topic. The 44 pages of notes, based on a 15-page bibliography, indicate a commendable and thorough level of research.<br /><br />As an informative exercise about an interesting topic, I can't find fault with NAZI PRISONERS OF WAR IN AMERICA. As a work of popular history for one casually interested in the subject, it's completely satisfying in all respects.<br /><br />At times, there's even humor of a sort. In the chapter \\"Escapes\\", the author relates the incident wherein three U-boat submariners fled into the hills of Tennessee, where one was subsequently shot dead by an old granny defending her water pump. When told by the local deputy sheriff whom she'd killed, she broke down saying she'd never have fired if she'd known the men were Germans. Asked who she thought the intruders were, she replied:<br /><br />\\"I thought they wuz Yankees.\\" Bobbie Lee would have been proud.	2005-01-05

Ok, I've been inexcusably tardy; I've been busy.<br /><br />As created by the author, the fictional Harry Flashman is an officer in the British Army during the reign of Queen Victoria. In FLASHMAN IN THE GREAT GAME, Flashy, by this time a colonel, is asked by Prime Minister Lord Palmerston to go to India to investigate unrest among sepoy troops, a potential uprising perhaps being fanned by Harry's old nemesis, Count Ignatieff of Russia. After Flashman arrives, he's forced to go underground by assuming the identity of a native enlistee in the 3rd Cavalry, Bengal Army - just in time to become embroiled in the Great Mutiny of 1857.<br /><br />Despite Flashy's growing reputation for heroism among the Army and Her Majesty's government, he's actually the greatest of cowards. His only interests are staying out of harm's way and having sex with as many women as possible. He's a rascal and a bounder of the first order. For female readers, Flashman is the man Mom warned about. For male readers, he is, perhaps, Everyman at heart. The charm of his memoirs, \\"The Flashman Papers\\", from which each book of the series is an excerpt, derives from the total honesty by which Flashy readily admits to his character deficiencies. It's only through canny opportunism, unwelcome circumstances, and luck that Harry's renown for derring-do increases with each installment.<br /><br />The appeal of Flashy's rascality aside, the strength of these stories is apparently the historical research that Fraser did to create the backdrop for Harry's adventures. In FLASHMAN IN THE GREAT GAME, the event is the savage 1857 uprising of Indian troops against their British masters that resulted in massacres of whites - men, women, and children - at such places as Meerut, Jhansi, and Cawnpore. The British reprisal was merciless. And Flashy is there to tell us all about it, as well as explain the cultural and religious factors that contributed to the bloodbath. As an instruction about something I knew nothing about, Harry's narrative more than justifies the cost of the book. (OK, so I got it free from an email pen pal. But, you get my meaning.)<br /><br />As I've no other Flashman novel for comparison, I was torn between awarding 4 and 5 stars. I settled on 4 as the safe option since that leaves room for improvement, which I may discover as I read additional volumes in the series. I do have to say, however, that I found Fraser's McAuslan trilogy more humorous and appealing, perhaps because the time, place, and protagonist are more contemporary.explain the cultural and religious factors that contributed to the bloodbath.

About halfway through, I realized that Dorothy's immediate forebears had a history much similar to mine. Around the time of the Bolshevik Revolution, her maternal grandparents and their youngest children emigrated to the U.S. from the Ukraine, following their three eldest children sent over previously. About the same time, my paternal grandparents emigrated to America from Romania with their youngest offspring, the oldest son having gone on before. In both cases, additional children were born in the States. There was a shared experience there, however nebulous, that made me appreciate this book more than I might have.<br /><br />Unlike the five-star SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS by Laura Shaine Cunningham, HOW I CAME INTO MY INHERITANCE is less of a warm and fuzzy celebration of family. The latter is perhaps more interesting than engaging, more poignant than charming. Each exhibits its author's own brand of humor, Gallagher's being a bit drier. Cunningham's pivot is always herself growing up, while Gallagher's stories often focus on her mother, father, and various aunts with only tangential reference to herself. Gallagher's have a discontinuous feel, although there is a broad, overlying time frame.<br /><br />The politics of Dorothy's parents and aunts is perhaps unusual among written memoirs of the U.S. between the world wars. They were passionately Red. Lenin's photo had a place of honor on the wall; Uncle Joe Stalin and the victories of the Soviet armies against the Nazi invaders were much admired. During the Depression, capitalism in America appeared to be moribund, and the family was prepared to welcome the new socialist world order. Oddly, Gallagher doesn't mention how much of this revolutionary spirit she retained. Apparently, it just failed to take, as the political and religious passions of parents often do in their offspring.<br /><br />For me, HOW I CAME INTO MY INHERITANCE hit its stride and was at its most interesting when Gallagher recounts her early efforts as a writer, first scribbling dubious stories about celebrities in such scandal mags as \\"Screen Stars\\" and \\"Movie World\\", forerunners of today's checkstand tabloids. Then, there was the agony of her first book, ALL THE RIGHT ENEMIES: THE LIFE AND MURDER OF CARLO TRESCA. Saddest is the second-to-last chapter, \\"The Last Indian\\", about her youngest aunt, Rachile, otherwise mostly ignored up to that point. Rachile outlived all of her siblings, dying convinced that she'd been terribly wronged throughout life by her brothers and sisters.<br /><br />HOW I CAME INTO MY INHERITANCE suffers greatly from not including a section of visual snapshots. While Dorothy can see with her mind's eye, the reader needs to be shown faces. While it might not have made the narrative more joyful, it would've put flesh on the past and given it a more balanced perspective. (I remember my own maternal grandmother dying as a bitter, unhappy old woman. It's good that I have photos of her cheerfully and vibrantly young. One forgets from where the aged come.)<br /><br />It appears to me that writing this book was the author's way of seeking closure. In the very last chapter, she recounts visiting Romania - as near as she could get to the Old Country - five years after her parents' deaths, and writes in the last paragraph:<br /><br />\\"And now, in this odd and wracked corner of the world, on this hill ... grief slipped away.

I felt happy as the day is long.\\"	2004-12-17

Your whole life makes me sick. ... You're shallow and materialistic, and I've never met anyone so obsessed with their own appearance and shopping.\\"<br /><br />In SHOPAHOLIC AND SISTER, the fourth book of the series by Sophie Kinsella, Becky is now Rebecca Brandon, wife of successful Luke Brandon, head of his own public relations firm. Just back from their 1-year, around-the-world honeymoon, during which Becky purchased more stuff than even Luke suspects until it's delivered to their London flat in two large lorries, Becky discovers that she has a sister. Half-sister, actually - her father's daughter, Jessica Bertram, conceived with a stewardess employed on the London to Carlisle train before he met Becky's Mum. Becky is thrilled; they can go shopping together, as well as do each other's nails. But to Becky's horror and despair, Jess is cut from different cloth; she's frugal to a fault, e.g. she reuses coffee grounds and makes kitchen scourers out of old onion bags, and carries a week's change of clothes in a brown rucksack. And she loathes to shop.<br /><br />SHOPAHOLIC AND SISTER is perhaps not as lighthearted throughout as the previous three. Through several chapters, Becky is bleakly despondent over what she perceives as a marriage on the rocks and failure to bond with Jess. But Becky's strongpoint has always been her resilience. Upon waking from unconsciousness after falling off a mountain ledge, she can observe the need for a manicure by the person waving a hand in front of her face asking, \\"How many fingers?\\"<br /><br />As much as the reader of the series might want to shout at Becky the reproach heading this review, the woman is unfailingly good-hearted and generous, and you just want to hug her - or shake her until her teeth rattle. Becky is one of the most winning heroines of trashy literature. By the end of the book, it's obvious where the author is going with the next installment.

And I have six more of his books lined up on the shelf to read, with many more on my wish list.<br /><br />Like the previous three, the theme of THE FIREMAN is revenge. As in PAY OFF, the reader never learns the protagonist's name. In this case, he's a correspondent for a London rag - let's call him \\"Bob\\" - who learns that his sister Sally, a freelance journalist, has taken a dive off a Hong Kong high-rise. Was it suicide or murder? Traveling to the Crown Colony - the book was first published in 1989, eight years before Red China took over the property - Bob is convinced she was murdered. Now, he's got to find out why and even the score.<br /><br />Stephen Leather was himself a writer for Hong Kong's \\"South China Morning Post\\". His familiarity with the city shows and provides an ambience to the plot that's perhaps the book's best feature. Unfortunately, there's not the same cleverness that I admired in THE STRETCH, where the protagonist is the wife of a British underworld boss forced to take over the business when Hubby is put behind bars, or THE CHINAMAN, where the hero is a Vietnamese immigrant to the UK out to exact vengeance on the IRA for a London bomb that caught his daughter in the collateral damage. THE FIREMAN reads more like a mediocre detective story. Only on page 192, when the reader becomes privy to an unsuspected aspect of Bob's relationship with Sis, did I do a mental double-take and think \\"Say, what!?\\" But Leather never develops this surprise further, and his hero eventually marches to the volume's conclusion never seeming as truly driven as he should be under the circumstances, and the ending was curiously flat.<br /><br />I gather that THE FIREMAN was one of the author's earlier works. While I might have given it four stars in a vacuum, in comparison with the other three, especially THE CHINAMAN and THE STRETCH, three is max.hree, especially THE CHINAMAN and THE STRETCH, three is max.	2004-12-10

The reader would've been better served if this volume's editors had eliminated the first 204 pages, which are barely more than a series of entries with the flavor of that for 18 April 1941:<br /><br />\\"Left 8:15 am for Dover where I met Bulgy Thorne and Charles Allfrey and went round with them defences 43rd Div round from Dover through Walmer, Deal, Ramsgate, Margate, Herne Bay and Whitstable. Finally returned at 6:45 pm and put in an hour in the office.\\"<br /><br />It isn't until AB becomes CIGS, when his perspective on the war becomes global and he interacts on a daily basis with Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his generals, and attends periodic conferences with Roosevelt and Stalin and their military chiefs, that AB's nightly jottings become interesting in an historical and personal sense. It's then you realize the truth behind AB's observation that heads this review.<br /><br />AB, rightly or wrongly, evidently considered himself to be the best war strategist available to the western Allies. His opinion of the strategic ability of Churchill and such military commanders as U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower, U.S. General George Marshall, U.S. Admiral Ernest King, and Louis Mountbatten (Supreme Commander, Southeast Asia) is positively scathing. Indeed, AB doesn't consistently say nice things about anybody except Field Marshal John Dill (his mentor and predecessor as CIGS), Joseph Stalin, and (briefly) U.S. General Douglas MacArthur (whom he never actually meets between these pages).<br /><br />The first post-war publication of AB's diary caused a stir on both sides of The Pond for its excoriation of Eisenhower and Churchill. Indeed, though AB admired and loved Winston as the superman without whom England would've lost the war, the latter's inconsiderate treatment of those around him and his gadfly approach to war strategy caused AB to write in frustration on 10 September 1944:<br /><br />\\"Never have I admired and despised a man simultaneously to the same extent.\\"<br /><br />What comes across in WAR DIARIES is that Alanbrooke was the consummate staff officer - competent, dedicated, meticulous, organized, hard working to a fault, intelligent, honest, honorable, and persistent - upon whom Winston relied upon (without giving public credit) to haul the Empire back from the brink of defeat. Outside of his duties, however, AB was an oddly mild and unprepossessing man. His chief hobby was birdwatching; he liked to show bird films to friends who came to dine with him and Benita. Also, he seems a rather dour individual who took himself too seriously. There's no evidence in his writing of any humor, self-deprecating or otherwise.<br /><br />WAR DIARIES contains a small section of sixteen photographs that's inadequate when considering those individuals often mentioned, but who don't appear: Roosevelt, King George VI, Stalin, de Gaulle, Eisenhower, AB's elder son Tom, Polish Lt. General Wladyslaw Anders, British generals \\"Jumbo\\" Wilson, Claude Auchinleck, and Ronald Adam, South African Prime Minister Smuts, and Canadian generals Andrew McNaughton and Henry Crerar.<br /><br />Despite the first 200 pages, which are virtually useless except that they introduce one to AB's way of thinking and writing style, I'm awarding four stars because the remainder of WAR DIARIES is a fascinating worldview rarely encountered by Yanks, a perspective in which the American icons of WWII mythology - Marshall, Eisenhower, Patton, Bradley, and Churchill - aren't painted as the heroes we're familiar with.

We did what we did, and it was worth doing, and no one could have done it better - or half as well.\\"<br /><br />Bravo! Well, said.<br /><br />George MacDonald Fraser, author and film screenwriter, has delighted fans for decades with his Flashman series, his Private McAuslan series (THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN, McAUSLAN IN THE ROUGH, THE SHEIKH AND THE DUSTBIN), his history of the Anglo-Scottish border brigands (THE STEEL BONNETS), and his autobiography of his World War Two soldiering with General Slim's 14th Indian Army in Burma (QUARTERED SAFE OUT HERE). For those acquainted with these works, THE LIGHT'S ON AT SIGNPOST presents a Fraser not before seen.<br /><br />This book's thirty chapters are assorted, ten each, into three categories: \\"Shooting Script\\", \\"Angry Old Man\\", and \\"Interludes\\". In the first, Fraser reminisces about script writing for such films as the Musketeers trilogy, PRINCE AND PAUPER, SUPERMAN 1 and 2, FORCE TEN FROM NAVARONE, OCTOPUSSY, and RED SONJA. In the second, the author is at his outraged and irascible best as he rails against Britain's participation in the post-9/11 Fourth Afghan War, the contemptible incompetence of Members of Parliament in general (\\"government from the gutter\\") and the New Labour government in particular, the abolition of the death penalty, political correctness, women in the armed forces, the race relations industry, unrestricted foreign immigration, the dismal state of British print journalism and television, greed and dishonesty in professional sports, and Britain's membership in the European Union. Finally, in chapters headed \\"Interlude\\", Fraser ruminates on such diverse topics as the Act of Settlement, which bars Roman Catholics from the throne, boyhood trips to Scotland in the family caravan (trailer), the Anglo-American \\"special relationship\\", a trip to Russia, the British Empire, and ...<br /><br />\\"... the modern craze for garlic and peppers is symptomatic of Britain's decline. Time was when both were unknown here, and the atmosphere was not rendered hideous by a stench reminiscent of an inferior Paraguayan bordello. (I have never been in Paraguay; I merely surmise.)\\"<br /><br />For me, the best parts of THE LIGHT'S ON AT SIGNPOST are Fraser's political and social commentaries. Indeed, he uses such language that would cause Liberals to gnash their teeth and rend their robes.  Luckily, I'm not a Liberal, so enjoyed his rants immensely. Less absorbing were his remembrances of the film industry, perhaps because I only saw one of the movies mentioned, although his descriptions of the personalities of Burt Lancaster, Oliver Hardy, Edward Fox, Robert Shaw, Harrison Ford, Steve McQueen, and Arnold Schwarzenegger were enlightening.<br /><br />The book's title refers to the grandstand scoreboard which monitors the Isle of Man's annual Tourist Trophy cross-country motorcycle race. As each contestant passes Signpost Corner, about a mile from the finish line, a light illuminates next to his slot on the scoreboard. Fraser recognizes that his life is coming to its natural end, and he's perhaps just passed his personal and last milepost.<br /><br />Fraser's books, particularly the McAuslan trilogy, occupy a place of honor on my mental shelves.

The scent seemed to swell around me ... and I was surrounded by Essence of Ranger... I was living a wet dream... Next time I broke into Ranger's apartment I would bring my own soap.\\"<br /><br />Besides being a disaster-prone bounty hunter working for her bailbondsman cousin Vinnie in Trenton, NJ, Stephanie Plum has a history of man problems throughout the ten-book series in which she is the engaging heroine. Primarily, there's Joe Morelli, the Trenton plainclothes cop with whom she has a sexual history dating back to when both were pre-teens, and with whom she has a relationship that could be called committed if it weren't for the regular spats that keep Stephanie moving in and out of Joe's house like a revolving door. Then there's Ranger, the frighteningly capable ex-Special Forces type that runs his own security business and does the odd fugitive apprehension job on the side for Vinnie, all the while bailing Plum out of tight spots, much to Joe's jealous chagrin. Extremely mysterious, Ranger drives expensive black vehicles, dresses all in black, and presumably returns each night to an unknown location of fable and legend among admiring females known as the Bat Cave. Why, Ranger can set Stephanie's heart (and other body parts) aflutter simply by placing his hand on her back and intoning \\"Babe\\".<br /><br />I'm giving TEN BIG ONES the uncommonly low score of three stars. True, there's the usual series of wacky events and personalities that Plum fans savor. But after ten novels, that's to be expected and nothing new. Here, an unusual set of circumstances has Stephanie discovering what she perceives to be the Bat Cave while Ranger is out of town. Having recently moved out from Morelli's (again) in a huff, and needing a place to stay while hiding from a vicious street gang killer, Plum takes up uninvited residence in Ranger's space - and enjoys his shower gel. If you're a faithful follower of the Plum series, as I am, and remember what Stephanie has done to one or two of Ranger's vehicles and employees, then you can see the potential here. But it goes unrealized, and I can hardly believe that Evanovich missed the opportunity.<br /><br />TEN BIG ONES also suffers from an ending perhaps more abrupt than usual. On the other hand, we get to see in action Connie, Vinnie's office manager, one of those bit players heretofore pretty much ignored, much like both Vinnie himself and Plum's long-suffering Dad. As I assume that the Plum series has a very long run ahead - Evanovich being a victim of her own success - I can only hope that these characters will eventually be spotlighted.<br /><br />I've previously suggested Sandra Bullock to play Stephanie in any film adaptation.

Ryan is a busy boy. And it doesn't hurt the legend that his film roles have mostly been played by Indiana Jones, a.k.a. Harrison Ford.<br /><br />In the book, it's mid-1981, and Clancy builds his plot around the real-life assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II by Mehmet Ali Agca. The author capitalizes on the conspiracy theory that the whole thing was stage managed by the Bulgarian secret police at the behest of Yuri Andropov, then head of the KGB.<br /><br />At this point in his career, Jack is a CIA analyst on loan to Britain's SIS London HQ, Century House. Over in the KGB's Moscow Center, communications officer Major Zaitsev suffers a crisis of conscience after transmitting secret messages setting up the plot to kill the Pope. So, Zaitsev, replete with the knowledge of Soviet spies in the British and American governments, decides to defect to the West, and Ryan becomes involved in the Anglo-American operation to get him out.<br /><br />Clancy is apparently an unabashed patriot, and his Ryan creation is a Red, White and Blue amalgam of a Boy Scout and Miss Goody Two-Shoes. That's fine, except that Clancy, through Jack, gets too preachy. Thus, we have Ryan expounding to anyone who'll listen such pearls of wisdom as:<br /><br />\\"The problem is that (the Soviet) economic system doesn't reward people for doing good work. There's a saying in economics: 'Bad money drives out good.' That means poor performance will take over if good performance isn't recognized. Well, over there, mainly it isn't, and for their economy it's like cancer. What happens in one place gradually carries over to the whole system.\\"<br /><br />And, regarding Jack's personal motivation:<br /><br />\\"But those doctrines (of the Catholic Church) were seen as a threat by the Soviet Union. What better proof of who the Bad Guys were in the world? Ryan had sworn as a Marine to fight his country's enemies. But here and now he swore to himself to fight against God's own enemies.\\" Oh, puhleeze!<br /><br />Mind you, RED RABBIT was first published in 2002, a decade after the collapse of the Evil Empire and it's disposal onto the ash heap of history. Isn't it time for Clancy to snap out of it?<br /><br />Now, I've read other Jack Ryan thrillers in the distant past and found them pretty good. By former standards, I might even have liked this one more than I did because it does have a reasonably clever core plot, albeit badly in need of severe editing. But, I've grown jaded, or my tastes in literary trash have matured with age. Now, I much prefer - and highly recommend - the lean and mean thrillers by British author Gerald Seymour. In Seymour's fictional world, his protagonists are ordinary blokes with everyday problems caught up in conflicts at the world's grotty margins. Seymour doesn't preach, his morale landscapes are filled with gray areas, and his heroes' victories are Pyrrhic more often than not.

In DREAMING OF AMERIKA, we have the heartfelt testimony of a foreign-born national whose dream was to come to the U.S. and acquire citizenship, and did. Legally, too - what a concept!<br /><br />Author Gabe Kubichek was born in Hungary in 1933. His narrative begins with his formative years, during which his homeland was dominated by Nazi Germany, followed by life under communism after the Soviet occupation commencing in 1945. Gabe tells of his stint in the Hungarian Army, his participation in the short-lived revolution of October 1956, and his flight to Austria. Subsequently, he emigrated to Canada, where he lived for a period, gaining that country's citizenship, before finally entering the United States and, in 1970, becoming an American citizen just short of his 37th birthday. Finally, Gabe volunteered for civilian duty with the Department of Defense in South Vietnam, serving there intermittently from 1973 to the country's collapse in May 1975.<br /><br />DREAMING OF AMERIKA is far from perfect. First off, because the author finished writing it at age 70, I would have expected more of the wisdom and hindsight of one who could look back on his life with a self-deprecating humor, especially when remembering those past actions that were naive or downright foolish, such as the ill-conceived plan to personally ambush the mass of Russian tanks on their way to Budapest to crush the 1956 uprising. There's no such perspective, and the narrative is oddly matter-of-fact and charmless. Otherwise, the tone is that of a much younger man, and this leads to my second objection, which is Gabe's never-ending preoccupation with womanizing. Evidently, he was (and may still be) quite the stud with the young and old, married and single. I'm not prudish, mind you; it's just that his incessant obsession with sex, and his desire to tell the reader all about his many conquests on three continents, became tiresome and verged on the sophomoric. Perhaps Kubichek thought it might sell more books.<br /><br />I'm awarding DREAMING OF AMERIKA four stars simply because it's a refreshing story we don't hear often enough, i.e. that from someone who revered the United States - perhaps more than native-born residents - from early on, and who moved heaven and earth to get here, arriving in North America with no knowledge of English and very little in the way of job prospects. Yet, playing by the immigration rules flagrantly scoffed at by so many nowadays, he ultimately became a professionally skilled, tax-paying citizen living his dream. Honor is due, and the country is richer for having him aboard.<br /><br />(Note: The edition of the book read and reviewed was a pre-publication, uncorrected proof.)s many conquests on three continents, became tiresome and verged on the sophomoric.

I've flipped back through the pages to ensure that I didn't miss something; I apparently didn't, so let's call him \\"Mac\\" because he's a Scotsman.<br /><br />Mac, a co-partner of Scottish Corporate Advisors, is a financier with a grudge. His father had managed an investment trust, Scottish Commercial Overseas Trust, until it was hijacked by Ronnie Laing and and Alan Kyle, the former a vicious drug dealer and the latter a specialist in hostile corporate acquisitions. During the SCOT takeover, Mac's mother died in an auto accident, perhaps arranged by Laing as a warning to her husband. In any case, the day after losing control of his company, Mac's despondent father blew his own brains out with a shotgun. Mac wants revenge, and plans an intricate sting that will frame Laing and Kyle for the theft of a large cocaine shipment from the IRA, an outfit you don't want to annoy. To that end, Mac enlists the help of a high-end courtesan, a car thief, an ex-SAS mercenary, and a driver who once worked for Laing. But the best laid plans oft go awry, and by the time Mac is dumping bodies into a Highland loch, events have spun out of control. Don't try this at home.<br /><br />This is only my third Leather thriller, with five more on the shelf to read. So far, the protagonists have been nominally law-abiding citizens forced by circumstance to the far side of the law. PAY OFF, at 240 paperbacked pages, is relatively short. While perhaps offering lo-carb plot and character development, this thriller met expectations for concept and action. However, as an otherwise honest Brit, Mac's knowledge of criminal activities, which allows him to set up the scam, seemed unseemingly comprehensive. I mean, I wouldn't know where to start. Perhaps Mac read too many crime novels.<br /><br />The book suggests one authored early in Leather's writing career, and perhaps kept on the shelf until it was needed to meet a publisher's deadline.

W. Brands, almost makes me want to do the tourist thing at the Alamo in San Antonio. But earlier this year, I saw THE ALAMO film starring Billy Bob Thornton et al, so maybe I'll just go to Oklahoma instead. That's just as rewarding as visiting Texas, right?<br /><br />This creditable narrative history of the area we now know as the Lone Star State really begins in 1821, when Stephen Austin, a debt-ridden and failed businessman, complies with his father's death-bed wish that he realize the latter's ambition of establishing a colony of expatriate Americans in the then Mexican province of Texas. The book ends in 1863 with the death of Sam Houston, the once-celebrated but failed Governor of Tennessee, who achieved personal redemption as the commander of the rebel Texan forces that beat the Mexican dictator General Santa Ana at the Battle of San Jacinto in 1836, and who went on to become the Texas Republic's first President and, after its admission to U.S. statehood, Senator and Governor. In between, the reader becomes acquainted with those other four men that play such a large role in Texas history and myth: Santa Ana, whose treatment of Texas and the Mexican central government is a lesson in self-aggrandizing ham-fistedness; Davy Crockett, the frontier legend and former U.S. Congressman from Tennessee, who sets out for Texas more out of curiosity than anything else; Jim Bowie of big knife fame, a veritable brigand, who seeks his fortune, ill-gotten or otherwise, in the troubled province; William Travis, who, after failing as a husband, lawyer, and newspaper publisher in Alabama, flees to Texas to gain eternal fame as the commander of the doomed Alamo garrison.<br /><br />LONE STAR NATION is an historical summary comprehensive enough in its details to satisfy one such as myself that once knew relatively little of the subject beyond Fess Parker's gallant death while playing the title role in Walt Disney's DAVY CROCKETT AT THE ALAMO (1955). To my mind, the volume comes across as quite even-handed when discussing the morality - if such a notion can be applied - surrounding Mexico's loss of Texas to the Manifest Destiny-minded Americans. Mexico's mistake was allowing any settlers from the States across the border in the first place, regardless of the newcomers' honest intentions. The province's location on the far periphery of the Mexican state, which made it next to impossible for the central government to effectively police against the subsequent flood of legal and illegal immigrants, and so difficult to populate with Mexican citizens from the interior, made the loss of the land virtually a foregone conclusion. There were honorable and dishonorable men on both sides of the conflict, and Mexico seemed to lose pretty much by default.  Brand describes no right or wrong here, only the inexorable forward migration of a human population at a particular time and place - simply one more instance of such in the long evolution of human history.<br /><br />I'm not awarding five stars because, after describing the Battle of San Jacinto and the Texas Declaration of Independence, LONE STAR NATION dribbles to a close over the final four chapters to culminate with the state's subsequent succession from the Union at the outbreak of the Civil War. For a leaner, more effective presentation, Brand might have better concluded with the 1836 events and followed with but a brief afterword.<br /><br />After finishing this book, I was reminded once again how fine a film was THE ALAMO (2004), starring Dennis Quaid as Houston, Billy Bob as Crockett, Emilio Echevarria as Santa Ana, Jason Patric as Bowie, and Patrick Wilson as Travis. It's a screen version so much more balanced and closer to the truth than any one previous - though historical and nationalistic purists will still find much to fault.my mind, the volume comes across as quite even-handed when discussing the morality - if such a notion can be applied - surrounding Mexico's loss of Texas to the Manifest Destiny-minded Americans.

One of Franca's group, Giancarlo, is a 19 year-old novice. He's also Franca's current sexual toy-boy, one in a long succession that she casually uses and discards. But Giancarlo, silly lad, is besotted. So, when Franca is captured by the state's antiterrorist unit, Giancarlo hatches a plot to single-handedly free the woman that deflowered him and win her undying love; he'll snatch Harrison from the kidnappers and exchange him for Franca, or execute him.<br /><br />Rather than creating fictional superheroes, Seymour conjures ordinary folks playing life-or-death roles in larger conflicts. His novels' characters are eminently believable, and this, for me, is the author's chief appeal. (And which is why I've read virtually all of his books.) THE HARRISON AFFAIR is no different in this regard. My only quarrel with this storyline is that the reader's sympathetic support is too fragmented between several protagonists. Should one cheer on the truly hapless Harrison, or Giuseppi Carboni, the Roman cop on the original kidnapping case, or Francesco Vellosi, the powerful head of the government's Public Security agency, or Archie Carpenter, a Scotland Yard inspector now working security for ICH, who's dispatched to Rome to liaison with the locals? It certainly isn't Violet Harrison, Geoffrey's spouse, who has a lot in common with Franca.<br /><br />Seymour once again gets into the minds of his finely crafted characters as the action and tension narrow down to a stiletto point.

But, WINSTON'S WAR is less about Chamberlain than the political infighting and back stabbing that brought Winston, thought to be a loudmouthed fool by his peers in Parliament and apparently washed-up in government, back to public office after years in political limbo.<br /><br />NEVER SURRENDER picks up the story on May 10, 1940, when Winston is asked by King George VI to form a new government to face the Nazi menace across the Channel, and portrays the next several weeks into early June as the British Expeditionary Force in France is forced by German panzers into a desperate position on the coast at Dunkirk, from which they, and as many French troops as possible, must be evacuated back to England via whatever boats can float.<br /><br />Winston, is, of course, the hero of the series, and the fictional story, based on factual events, is portrayed from his point of view. Several major figures continue from the first to second volumes, including the King, the U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James, snake-in-the-grass Joseph Kennedy, and Winston's loyal friend and political confidant, Brendan Bracken . To provide a human face to events in France, Dobbs pens the characters of Don Chichester, a conscientious objector serving with the Royal Ambulance Corps, Claude, a downed and injured French pilot that Don patches up, and a spaniel, named \\"Winston\\" by Chichester for his constant barking, that adopts the two during their retreat to the Dunkirk beach.<br /><br />I was less enamored of NEVER SURRENDER than WINSTON'S WAR, though it's still a decent read. Dobbs moves back and forth between Churchill and Chichester; perhaps he should of stayed with the former for a leaner plot (since this is, after all, a saga about Winston). Churchill, plagued with feelings of deep inadequacy as he copes with defeatist ministers, intransigent generals, and a military disaster of biblical proportions, lives in the shadow of his politically disgraced and deceased father, with whose portrait he carries on imaginary conversations. Don's relationship with his own father, a stern and uncompromising Anglican vicar, has been strained ever since his mother died giving him birth. Indeed, the two are barely on speaking terms.<br /><br />Dysfunctional relationships between fathers and sons is very much a theme of this book, and I got the feeling that the author tried too hard to make the point, especially after Winston's debilitating obsession with his father's memory received such scant attention in WINSTON'S WAR. And furthermore, the whole Don/Claude thing seemed inconsequential window dressing. Indeed, the ending to this sidebar was so contrived for effect that I almost pitched the book into a corner.  If there had to be a subplot at all, I would rather it had revolved around, say, Bertram Ramsay, the beleaguered Vice Admiral in his subterranean tunnels under Dover Castle charged with bringing the Tommies back from Dunkirk. Or Winston the dog.<br /><br />So, keeping a stiff upper lip, it's on to the third book in the series, [[ASIN:1402213921 Churchill's Hour: A Novel of Defiance]].stayed with the former for a leaner plot (since this is, after all, a saga about Winston).

Note: This book is also published under the title [[ASIN:055214732X At Close Quarters]]<br /><br />Jane Canning has a minor spat with her lover Holt. A few minutes later, a lone gunman kills Jane, the personal secretary to the British military attach&eacute; in Moscow, along with the British Ambassador to the USSR outside their hotel in Yalta. Holt, the latter's private secretary, sees it all, including a close-up view of the assassin's distinctively scarred face.<br /><br />Comparing Holt's description of the murderer to a database of surveillance photos, MI6 in London identifies the killer as Palestinian fighter Abu Hamid. Since Jane was also the Secret Intelligence Service's agent in Moscow, the MI6 Director General recruits Holt to accompany Noah Crane, an Anglo-Jewish veteran sniper on loan from the Israeli Army, into Lebanon's dangerous Beqa'a Valley to exact vengeance. The plan is for Crane to shoot Hamid after Holt positively identifies him. Haunted by Jane's last words, \\"Don't be childish, Holt\\", the young and inexperienced Third Secretary in Her Majesty's Diplomatic Corps agrees.<br /><br />AN EYE FOR AN EYE is another in a series of excellent covert action novels by Gerald Seymour whose writing embodies the best of John le Carr&eacute; and Adam Hall. Le Carr&eacute;'s spy stories emphasize the subtleties of character and plot development, while Hall's focus on the plot twists and close run things that bedevil his hero Quiller through many sagas. In this case, the character evolution is all Holt's as he's chaperoned by the crusty and non-communicative Crane into harm's way. Crane calls Holt \\"youngster\\", and instructs him, for survival's sake, to watch everything he does - and learn. It's OJT out on the sharp edge. In the meantime, the intelligence operatives of Syria, Israel and Great Britain are all conniving for better or worse in the background.<br /><br />In most of the espionage or conspiracy thrillers I've read, the end is nice and tidy, and the hero walks away with the girl. There are no shades of gray in a world once again kept safe for democracy from the diabolical scheming of the Great Unwashed. What I like about Seymour's novels, AN EYE FOR AN EYE included, is that the winners are left almost as damaged as the losers, and the victories won have a certain hollowness.

Carew was convicted of murder after aiding the escape of four Blacks who pitched a bomb into the Rand Supreme Court in Johannesburg. Isolated and lonely, Jeez sends a letter to his former wife back in the UK. Before he deserted her and his toddler son years before, Carew's name was Curwen.<br /><br />Jack Curwen, 27, is a junior executive with a demolitions company. He's also Jeez's son. When he learns from his mother that Jeez is soon for South African gallows, a stubborn sense of loyalty propels him to Her Majesty's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. FCO officially tells him there's nothing to be done. However, a sympathetic Whitehall maverick tells Jack that his father is not what he appears to be. And, for the sake of political expediency, the Government and the MI6 mandarins in Century House have decided that Jeez is expendable. Determined to do right by his Old Man, Jack gets some practical advice from a crusty old explosive expert, and flys to Johannesburg. He's going to blast Jeez out of that gaol.<br /><br />Author Gerald Seymour's fictional worlds are comprised of moral ambiguities; right and wrong come in myriad shades of gray. Therefore, in SHADOW ON THE SUN, it's no surprise that there are \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" people on both sides of the line in apartheid South Africa, and all are doing their duty as they see it. But Jack's self-imposed mission is noble - of that the reader has no doubt. Jack's focus enables him to dance around the larger social issues.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting character is Jeez, a steadfast and long-suffering subject in Her Majesty's service, who's come to expect reciprocal loyalty from the London desk jocks who send men into harm's way. But this isn't the old days, and the remnant of Empire is the worse for it.<br /><br />Seymour's heroes, usually Brits, are invariably ordinary individuals with cores of extraordinary fortitude placed in life or death situations, oftimes against more powerful forces.

The go-between is a 22-year old I Corps junior stenographer, Corporal Tracy Barnes, who becomes Becker's lover. Becker is sent by his controller to East Germany's Baltic coast to glean information from radar base signals. There, Hans is captured and brutally murdered by Stasi Counter Espionage Captain Dieter Krause. Barnes suspects Krause's guilt, but can't prove it. And Hans remains the first and only man that Tracy has ever slept with.<br /><br />Now, it's a decade later. The Berlin Wall is rubble, Germany is re-united, and Dieter Krause is the new darling of the German intelligence service, the BfV, because of the information he can provide on an old friend, Russian Army Colonel Pyotr Rykov, who's the influential personal assistant to the Russian Defense Minister. The Germans are showing Krause off, first to the Brits, then the Yanks. However, during a visit to the I Corps base in Ashford, Kent, Dieter is recognized by Barnes, who physically attacks him. Clapped into the base guardhouse, Tracy is interrogated by a veteran SIS man sent down from London, Albert Perkins of German Desk, but he gets nothing. Released from detention, Barnes goes to Germany to unearth the evidence to bring Dieter down. She's accompanied by Josh Mantle, a solicitor's clerk persuaded to the task by Tracy's mother. Josh, at 54, was once of I Corps, then of the Royal Military Police. Stubbornly his own man and awkwardly dedicated to principles, Mantle was discarded by the Army at the end of the Cold War. Now, he's tired and on the ash heap of imminent old age. Against his better judgement, but always for the underdog, Tracy's dangerous mission demands his participation.<br /><br />DEAD GROUND at first begins as a relatively simple tale of long-delayed justice. Well, ok, vengeance. But \\"simplistic\\" is never an apt description of Gerald Seymour's thrillers. Tracy's implacable, single-minded quest becomes almost a sideshow as Perkins, following Barnes and Mantle to Germany, has his own agenda to put the upstart BfV back into \\"its place\\". And another scarred veteran of the Cold War, the iron-haired and intimidating Olive Harris of the SIS Russian Desk, convinces the MI6 wallahs to activate her own scheme, i.e. to topple Pyotr Rykov (which would render Krause's humint pretty much valueless).<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Seymour's novels. But, in DEAD GROUND, I reluctantly suggest that the plot is too complicated. He should've left out the Harris gambit and focused solely on Perkins, Mantle, Barnes, and Krause. When Olive arrives in Moscow to administer the coup de grace to Rykov, the local SIS station head asks, \\"Why are we mounting a hostile operation against Pyotr Rykov? ... Your game is the immediate destruction of a fine man.\\" That just about says it all, and perhaps the only usefulness of the subplot is to illustrate that \\"our side\\" (and the gentler sex) can be just as ruthless as \\"their side\\" when it comes to destroying a man.<br /><br />Seymour's forte is showing that victory is often Pyrrhic. The most tragic victor of this story is undoubtedly Mantle, self-crucified on the Cross of Principle. You might think that role would be Tracy's, but, as the reader learns in a surprise ending, she's not what she appears to be through 99% of the novel.<br /><br />Overall, a jolly good show.

THE RUNNING TARGET is a masterpiece of his writing.<br /><br />As the book begins, a young Iranian woman, Juliette Eshraq, is publicly hanged to death on a crane in downtown Tabriz by the revolutionary government that had previously overthrown the Shah and executed the girl's father and uncle. The plot then skips forward several years, and Juliette's younger brother, Charlie, who'd escaped to California with his American mother, is now of age and on a mission of vengeance in the Old Country to kill those who murdered the rest of his family. Charlie is secretly run by a senior executive of MI-6, Mattie Furniss, Head of the Iran Desk at Century House, friend of the Eshraq family from his time as Station Officer in Tehran during the Shah's rule, and Charlie's mentor. After carrying out three assassinations, Charlie must now return to Britain to get the expensive, advanced, weaponry needed to finish the job. As Charlie tells Mattie, money is no problem.<br /><br />In the meantime, Lucy Barnes, teenage daughter of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Defense, dies of a heroin overdose in a squalid London flat. In his rage and grief, the Secretary prevails on his friend and government colleague, the Home Secretary, to flog the drug enforcement unit of Customs and Excise to exert maximum effort to find the pusher, distributor, and source. In the course of investigation, it's learned that the heroin is from Iran and brought into England by a man known only as Charlie Persia.<br /><br />As the final piece in the plot's set-up, Furniss is ordered by MI-6's Director General to Iran's periphery to meet with his agents and improve the quality of information coming across. Mattie is code-named \\"Dolphin\\". But, because of a leak in Britain's Bahrain Embassy, Iran's counter-intelligence unit knows Dolphin is coming, and plans accordingly.<br /><br />A major component of THE RUNNING TARGET is a conflict between two agencies of Her Majesty's government in which dedicated and well-meaning civil servants are ground up in the cogs of political maneuvering, and the ostensible \\"bad guy\\" squeezes through the crack. The battle on the home front makes almost irrelevant the machinations and brutality of Iranian counter-intelligence, though, by the end of the book, the reader is left to wonder which side administered the greater damage to our hero, the servants of the Mullahs or those of the Queen.<br /><br />THE RUNNING TARGET is one of the most complex and deliciously constructed of Seymour's many thrillers that I've read to date. Indeed, the reader is thrown a red herring at the beginning as to the identity of the storyline's chief protagonist. In any case, Seymour's forte is blurring the lines between the Good and the Evil; the former doesn't always win, nor does the latter always lose, to the satisfaction of Justice. The victory is usually pyrrhic.

LONDON'S DISUSED UNDERGROUND STATIONS is a glossy, photo-rich, reference book more apt to be found in the home of Tube obsessives. The esoteric nature of the knowledge it contains is reminiscent of the recently reviewed WHAT'S IN A NAME: THE ORIGINS OF STATION NAMES ON THE LONDON UNDERGROUND.<br /><br />Author J.C. Connor describes the life histories of 21 Tube stations that have been taken off-line since 1900: King William Street, North End, Hounslow Town, City Road, South Kentish Town, Park Royal & Twyford Abbey, Down Street, York Road, British Museum, Brompton Road, Osterley Park & Spring Grove, St. Mary's (Whitechapel Road), Uxbridge, Lords, Malborough Road, Swiss Cottage (Metropolitan Line), Wood Lane, South Acton, White City, Aldwych, and Charing Cross (Jubilee Line). The twenty-one appear in chronological order based on the year of closure; King William Street, closed in 1900, comes first, and Charing Cross, closed in 1999, comes last. Ten of the twenty-one shut their doors in the 1930s.<br /><br />Connor's narrative style is bone-dry and relatively unembellished with anything other than hard facts. A small sampling of text concerning York Road (closed 1932) is representative of the book's tone:<br /><br />\\"The street level building was sited on the corner of York Road (now York Way) and Bingfield Street, and was designed by the architect Leslie William Green. It was built by the firm of Ford & Walton Ltd. at a cost of (pounds sterling) 8,176 and was clad in (pounds sterling) 1,022.5.9d's worth of glazed ruby-red tiling by the Leeds Fireclay Company.\\"<br /><br />And, regarding this station's remnants:<br /><br />\\" ... until the 1960s, it was still possible to clearly see the grimy (platform) tiling from a passing train ... The vast majority of tiling has been painted out, although a few small sections have not been touched. The signal box also survives, with its windows blackened after years of disuse.\\"<br /><br />Only rarely does Connor touch on a defunct station's local color: the ghost said to inhabit an old tunnel, the movie shot on-site, or the apocryphal story of the commuter who mistakenly detrained on an old platform and was stranded overnight. Otherwise, the story of each station is one of tunnel widths, booking hall layout, tile color scheme, track additions, platform extensions, street-level remodelings, war use as an air-raid shelter, level of commuter traffic, etc.<br /><br />LONDON'S DISUSED UNDERGROUND STATIONS contains many photographs of the under-ground (or above-ground) platforms and street-level facades, mostly black and white prints from the late 19th century and the first 30 years of the 20th when the stations were in their working prime. Perhaps most interesting to readers who are fascinated by \\"then\\" and \\"now\\" pictures are the contemporary color shots of still extant street-level facades that can be compared to earlier views.<br /><br />The book's final pages include narrative summaries about a further 13 stations that have been re-sited rather than shuttered-up, and text about other disused street-level buildings associated with the Central, District, East London, Northern, and Piccadilly Lines.<br /><br />As I assume the true Tube obsessive would go out of his/her way to catch a glimpse of the occasional abandoned station while being whisked along in the modern London Underground, I was puzzled to note that this volume contains no map of the modern system with the locations of the ghost stations marked. To imprecisely find them, I was forced to peer through a magnifying glass at the small type of a compact LONDON A-Z street and Tube guide - behavior that, admittedly, my wife thought aberrant. In my defense, I must state that I've not left Connor's book out on the living room coffee table where it might serve as solid evidence of an eccentric fixation.<br /><br />Finally, the author must have some surveying experience as he makes frequent use of a unit of distance measure called the \\"chain (ch)\\", i.e. 66 feet, the definition of which I had to look-up on the Web.	2004-09-17

Now, Terry is convicted of murdering a small time drug-dealer and is sent off to Her Majesty's Prison for life. It isn't until Terry asks Sam to take over the reins of his business that she shockingly realizes the extent of his underworld activity. But, faced with legal fees, mortgage payments, Jamie's university tuition, and 24/7 care for her debilitated mother-in-law, Sam is forced to oversee dealings in police payoffs, black-market liquor, cannabis smuggling, and the importation of counterfeit currency. Oddly, she proves surprisingly adept at it. And, when Terry is unexpectedly released from the gaol on new evidence, he finds out how talented she really is. Oh, does he ever.<br /><br />There are no heroes in lilly-white hats in THE STRETCH. Though he truly loves his family despite his cheatin' ways, Terry's a charming rascal capable of heavy-handed brutality to maintain his criminal empire. On the other hand, Sam proves she can be just as unscrupulous, though she operates with finesse and, um, compassion.  In any case, it's Sam that the reader roots for, certainly not the unsavory copper, Detective Chief Inspector Frank Welch, who made the case against Terry and is now out to get his missus. By default perhaps, the only truly admirable character of any importance seems to be Andy McKinley, the unfailingly polite, dependable, and circumspect bodyguard that Terry assigns to drive his wife on her appointed rounds.<br /><br />The Gerald Seymour novels are consistently engrossing because of the moral gray areas in conflicts at the civilized world's grittier margins in which his protagonists dwell, and in which battles there are no clear winners and losers, only Pyrhhic victories. Here, in THE STRETCH, Leather presents an unremarkable, basically law-abiding citizen driven to extremes of antisocial behavior in order to protect the wellbeing of herself and her family. Which one of us might not do the same if backed into a corner? If that isn't a gray area, I don't know what is.<br /><br />Sam, you go girl!ly engrossing because of the moral gray areas in conflicts at the civilized world's grittier margins in which his protagonists dwell, and in which battles there are no clear winners and losers, only Pyrhhic victories.

News reporter and author Stephen Smith goes below pavement level in London, allowing the reader to vicariously explore burial crypts, dug-up plague pits, sewers, excavated Roman walls, remnants of Henry VIII's tennis courts, poncy wine cellars, secret government bunkers, the bowels of Parliament, and forgotten corners of the Tube.<br /><br />For me, the the most intriguing chapter dealt with that subterranean environment most obviously accessible to the tourist, the London Underground (\\"Mind the Gap!\\"). Did you know that the most prevalent litter in the system, cleaned up during routine housekeeping between 1:00 and 5:00 AM, is human hair blown from the heads of thousands and thousands of train riders every day? Then, there are all those wallets plundered and discarded by pickpockets. And, though it won't be on my Must-Do short list for my next visit to the city, Smith's slog down the northern outflow sewer was gratifyingly informative.<br /><br />However, UNDERGROUND LONDON is an uneven read. In the chapter dedicated to Anglo-Saxon artifacts, the author first describes a modern day ceremonial ritual involving holding a small schoolboy by his heels over the Thames while he beats the water's surface with a stick, and then goes on to describe the confiscated oddities to be found in the cellars of Her Majesty's Custom House. The connection between these and Anglo-Saxon period seemed forced. And the chapter in which Smith visits an underground vault of safe deposit boxes could just as well have been penned in the above-ground strong room at my local bank. No revelations there.<br /><br />Perhaps the narrative's best features are the brief lessons in London history, past and recent, that Smith provides as background to the central theme: the evolution of city sanitation, the medieval plague epidemics, the theory and practice of the Thames Barrier, Henry VIII's obsession with tennis, the use of Tube stations as bomb shelters during the Blitz, and the British government's renewed interest in secure bolt holes after 9/11.<br /><br />A criticism of UNDERGROUND LONDON has been that it includes no photos. Normally, I'd agree. But, in this instance, I'm not sure that the majority of Smith's subjects would've provided opportunity for interesting or instructive visuals. Somehow, a shot of the now-buried Fleet River churning along at the bottom of a well in Clerkenwell, or that of a disintegrating coffin in Kensal Green cemetery, doesn't seem necessary.<br /><br />For those who love London, UNDERGROUND LONDON will be an occasionally  rewarding ... um, travel essay. I'm awarding four stars simply because London is where my heart is.

The experiences of his internship served as the basis for his 1984 novel, [[ASIN:3426638819 House of God]], starring his alter ego, Dr. Roy Basch. In [[ASIN:1586481614 Gracefully Insane: Life and Death Inside America's Premier Mental Hospital]], a narrative history of McLean Hospital, the mental health facility traditionally serving Boston's upper crust, author Alex Beam notes that Bergman did his psychiatry residency at McLean. Presumably, this and subsequent experiences in the field, enabled Bergman to write MOUNT MISERY, the further adventures of Dr. Basch during his first year of training at the fictional Mount Misery psychiatric hospital.<br /><br />MOUNT MISERY is billed as a dark comedy. And perhaps the first half of the book is just that. Then it becomes decidedly more serious - Bergman's indictment of what he perceives as the flaws, and indeed malpractice, within institutionalized mental health care: assembly line admissions with diagnoses designed to mine the maximum in insurance payments, over-reliance on unproven drug regimens to make patients \\"better\\", the emphasis on fund raising rather than medicine, the superegos of the \\"experts\\" that focus on appearances in medical journals and at international seminars instead of compassionate patient care, and the total hogwash (to Bergman, apparently) of Freudian analysis. Indeed, the author's criticism of institutional psychiatry evolves to a very sharp point, i.e. the sexual abuse of patients by their physician therapists, and the protection of the latter by the medical establishment. This is not the stuff of humor, dark or otherwise.<br /><br />I still might have given MOUNT MISERY four stars but for several reasons. First, at 527 paperbacked pages, the book is way too long; the point could've been made in a shorter span of text. Second, once Bergman makes his case against the failures of the system, he, through the intrepid Dr. Roy, gets too preachy. (I hate being lectured in any medium designed to extract my dollars ostensibly to provide me with entertainment.) Finally, the author bends over backwards to tidy up the story's conclusion with relatively happy endings for the novel's major and minor protagonists. Indeed, the very last scenes involving Basch, his significant other Berry, and their adopted daughter Lizzy, were so warm and fuzzy as to almost induce the gag reflex. (OK, so I'm a curmudgeon and am in need of Prozac. But, give me a break!)<br /><br />As I recall, I also rated THE HOUSE OF GOD at only three stars for similar reasons. I suspect MOUNT MISERY would appeal greatly to anti-establishment psychiatrists and other mental health caregivers, who would respond \\"Yup, been there, done that!\\". But, no more Samuel Shem stuff for me, thanks very much. Life is too short for well-intentioned rants that don't reveal anything new.failures of the system, he, through the intrepid Dr. Roy, gets too preachy.

They didn't deserve to walk into a room with Cassandra French on their arm.\\"<br /><br />Thus, with that dysfunctional experience with male-female relationships in her past, 29-year old Cassandra French, employed in the business office of a Los Angeles movie studio, proactively sets out to mold three young men with promise - her \\"boys\\" - into the New Age men they could be, replete with polished manners, polite language, sensitivity to a woman's needs, chivalry, and good fashion sense. Cassie has kept Owen, Alan and Daniel chained to cots in the basement of her Westwood home for months, alternating behavioral modification \\"lessons\\" with doses of calming morphine.  (I've lived in SoCal for five decades, and have never been in a home with a basement. After the Cuban Missile Crisis, my Dad built a bomb shelter under our garage - but that doesn't count.)<br /><br />CASSANDRA FRENCH'S FINISHING SCHOOL FOR BOYS is, believe it or not, a remarkably comedic novel. Author Eric Garcia pulls this off by making his heroine decidedly unhinged, but not cruel or even unkind. Indeed, she reads her charges bedtime stories, tucks them in at lights out, entertains them with games and a regular \\"movie night\\", keeps them properly fed, and fully intends to release them back into the world once they \\"graduate\\". But things begin to unravel when she \\"enrolls\\" in her school a famous actor who'd seduced and bedded her for uncommonly selfish and boorish reasons. Once under restraint and in her control, he subsequently dies in a freak accident involving chains, manacles, electric current, and yoga.<br /><br />I haven't come across such an engaging female lead since Rebecca Bloomwood of Sophie Kinsella's SHOPAHOLIC series. Even when faced with the immediate problem of body disposal, in which caper she involves her best friend Claire, Cassie still has the presence of mind to notice the quality of Claire's cashmere sweater and footwear, and discuss corpse removal options over Amaretto and low-fat Fig Newtons.<br /><br />I'm not awarding five stars because the ending seemed forced - perhaps not surprising considering the bizarre and implausible storyline that Garcia backed French into. But the plot is inventive and light, and would make the perfect vehicle for a Big Screen movie starring Sandra Bullock.est friend Claire, Cassie still has the presence of mind to notice the quality of Claire's cashmere sweater and footwear, and discuss corpse removal options over Amaretto and low-fat Fig Newtons. <br /> <br />I'm not awarding five stars because the ending seemed forced - perhaps not surprising considering the bizarre and implausible storyline that Garcia backed French into.

As a matter of fact, the reader doesn't have a glimmer of understanding until page 327 of 362. Until then, four subplots proceed on more or less separate paths. One must have faith that they eventually coalesce.<br /><br />Jordan Mitchell is CEO of Borders Atlantic, a communications company on the verge of marketing a system for cellular phone message encryption that will stymie even the electronic eavesdroppers at the National Security Agency.<br /><br />Senator Elizabeth Beechum chairs the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Fearing Mitchell's new technology will give terrorists the upper hand, she's determined to stop it cold. Beechum is also likely to be the nominee for president to come out of the Democratic National Convention being held in a couple weeks. Unfortunately, she gets derailed when she's attacked by an unknown assailant and rendered unconscious in her Georgetown home. When she comes to, the room is awash in blood - not hers. Though there's no body, circumstantial evidence leads her to be charged with murder.<br /><br />Jeremy Waller is the FNG on the FBI's elite Hostage Rescue Team, assigned as a sniper. After a successful first mission in Puerto Rico to free the kidnapped daughter of the island's governor, Waller finds himself seconded to a mysterious two-man operation in Yemen so hush-hush that even his HRT bosses don't know about it. What's the FBI doing in an overseas gig, anyway?<br /><br />Sirad Malneaux, a fast-rising executive in Borders Atlantic, finds herself hand-picked by Mitchell, apparently on the basis of her ability to convincingly lie, for an important assignment. Does he know she really works for the CIA?<br /><br />Then, to make things interesting, an obscure American techno-firm has devised a new way to kill - with concentrated sounds waves that blow out the victim's skull. (In the movie version, wouldn't that make a great special effect?)<br /><br />The twist to the story, revealed in the last thirty-five pages, should be clever enough to lift BLACK above standard fare. But that's counter-balanced by two-dimensional main characters, none of whom I particularly cared about. To be fair, author Christopher Whitcomb faced a dilemma in the evolution of his plot. By the story's end, the reader realizes why he couldn't demonize any one of his players. Yet, in order to keep the reader guessing, he couldn't make any one of them too sympathetic. After all, there has to be both a Protagonist and Antagonist in any story, right? Perhaps only Beechum is blameless from the start.

It may be readily purchased from the UK site of your favorite Web bookseller.<br /><br />WHAT'S IN A NAME alphabetically lists roughly 270 stations - I counted twice, with a different result each time - of the Underground, and another 34 of the Docklands Light Rail system. The name's origin, the year the station opened, and the name changes that have since occurred are described for each. A typical entry:<br /><br />\\"DEBDEN takes its name from a natural location of the area and is recorded as Deppendana in the Domesday Book. It is derived from the Old English DEP, 'deep' and DEN, 'valley' - which means simply 'the deep valley'. It was recorded as Depeden in 1227. The station was opened by the Great Eastern Railway as Chigwell Road on 24 April 1865, and re-named Chigwell Lane on 1 December 1865. It was again renamed as Debden on 25 September 1949 when first used by Underground trains.\\"<br /><br />The book is liberally sprinkled with black and white photos of the stations or their immediate environs. Most date from the early 20th century, and none are later than, say, 1955.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the book includes no overall schematic of the Underground system - not even on the back of the back cover, where it usually makes an appearance.<br /><br />WHAT'S IN A NAME is for Tube obsessives, or for those whose hobby is the derivation of English place names. Anyone else may find it as interesting reading as a dictionary. Despite my love for London and its Underground, I'm ambivalent.	2004-08-22
553066:US	53075086	R1GSIMWREDKU2B	1585675156	663206374	Calendar Girl: In Which a Lady of Rylstone Reveals All	Books	2	8	9	N	N	No front bottoms	In 2003, American audiences were treated to CALENDAR GIRLS, a little gem of a film starring Helen Mirren based on the experiences a group of women in their 40s, 50s and 60s in the north of England who posed starkers for a year 2000 calendar to raise money for leukemia research, and in memory of John Baker, the husband of one of the ladies and a locally well-regarded and much loved Assistant National Park Officer in the Yorkshire Dales, who'd died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in July 1998. Of course, the nudity, both in the film and on the calendar, was tastefully presented, with the naughty bits obscured and most definitely \\"no front bottoms\\". The calendar's concept, and the driving force behind its creation, came from Tricia Stewart, a close friend of John and Angela Baker. In real life, Tricia ran a medical software company with her husband, Ian, and taught yoga and Pilates on the side. This book, CALENDAR GIRL, is Tricia's story of the 2-year flurry of frenetic activity that the calendar catalyzed, and the roughly 300,000 copies that were sold in Britain and the United States.<br /><br />First of all, let me unequivocally state that the film adaptation was wonderful, and I deeply admire author Alicia Stewart for the originality of her idea and for the hard work and dedication she and her colleagues demonstrated in getting the calendar created and marketed. What started out almost as a lark burgeoned into a monster with a life of its own - as such things are wont to do - involving a grueling schedule of domestic and foreign media interviews, appearances on television talk shows and at book-signings both at home and in the U.S., product endorsements, the film, and considerable fame. And the Leukemia Research Fund in Britain and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America received a bunch of money. It also destroyed friendships, almost administered the coup-de-grace to a marriage, and, as a final insult, subjected Tricia and Ian to hateful articles in the gutter press. However, that tribute said ...<br /><br />I realized what was wrong with CALENDAR GIRL about two-thirds into it. It has the flow of a diary, and I gather that Stewart used such as the primary source for her narrative. Trouble is, she failed to edit out so very much that was trivial and, frankly, numbingly boring. As a random example of the story's \\"feel\\" , which is typical of the book throughout:<br /><br />\\"Lynda had had an invite from Preethi, the Indian girl we'd met at the bookfair, to go to her book launch at Dover Street, by the Ritz, on Thursday night. It was the same day as a shoot in London for the \\"Mail's You\\" magazine. Lynda had sent her a calendar, which was in her office. She was having a stressful day organizing her launch and when she went in her office, the calendar fell off the shelf. So she phoned Lynda who was also miserable and the depression lifted for both of them.\\"<br /><br />Then later, when they meet this Preethi for the launch dinner:<br /><br />\\"Sunflowers mean happiness and are Preethi's mum's favourite flower. We met her mum and dad and lots of her friends and drank champagne. Her book focuses on following your dreams, following the African dancer. Later after speeches an African dancer appeared and a band, it was brilliant.\\"<br /><br />All of the above - and so much more in a similar vein -should've been left out, but perhaps wasn't because the resulting volume wouldn't have been much more than a pamphlet in length.<br /><br />I really wanted to award at least three stars because Tricia's heart is in the right place, but just couldn't because I struggled to finish CALENDAR GIRL, and was so relieved when I arrived at the last period.

However, by the end of book eight (HARD EIGHT), even that was beginning stale around the edges. But elements of TO THE NINES have reinvigorated my interest.<br /><br />If you don't know from your assigned reading by now, Stephanie is a bond enforcement agent - a bounty hunter - employed by her bail bondsman cousin, Vinnie, in Trenton, NJ. While Plum eventually manages to catch her man (or woman), she invariably leaves a trail of chaos in her wake, and her modus operandi is endearingly klutzy. Plus, all the characters in her personal and professional life lie on a continuum from being mildly eccentric to outright wack jobs. Only her pet hamster, Rex, is normal.<br /><br />In TO THE NINES, Stephanie's quarry is Samuel Singh, an Indian in the States on a temporary work visa on which Vinnie has underwritten a new type of bond - a \\"visa bond\\". But Singh has disappeared, and the resulting bad publicity will destroy Vinnie's business unless his disaster-prone cousin can find him. Assigned to help in the search is Vinnie's premier contract agent, Ranger, a mysterious ex-Special Forces type that operates just outside the law and who, since book one (ONE FOR THE MONEY), has inpired a warm feeling in our heroine's nether regions despite her off-and-on emotional and sexual commitment to another cousin, Trenton police detective Joe Morelli, who relieved Stephanie of her virginity behind a bakery's pastry counter back when they were teenagers. Ranger is a Hunk Dressed in Black.<br /><br />As I hinted earlier, the Stephanie Plum comedic thrillers, while always very funny, follow an invariable pattern. Author Evanovich apparently has a storyline template to which she religiously adheres. (And who would argue? It produces Best Sellers.) However, for those of us - well, at least me - loyally following Plum's keystone-cop antics, some significant deviation from the pattern would be welcomed. In TO THE NINES, the author breaks the mold just a little. For once, Stephanie gets out of Trenton on her quarry's trail - all the way to Las Vegas, NV - unreasonably harassed by airline security at every stop. And instead of demolishing the various cars and trucks loaned to her by Ranger, now it's the latter's employees who're imperiled by Stephanie's bad karma.<br /><br />Finally, Stephanie's sister Valerie gives birth. This flips the switch on the former's own maternal instincts. Somewhere vaguely in her thirties, Stephanie isn't getting any younger and the Biological Clock is ticking. Do you suppose that Morelli is the man for the job? Of course, they'd have to get married first - an event that's proved maddeningly elusive in previous installments, much to the distress of Stephanie's Mom. Indeed, the plotting for future Plum novels involves potentially infinite permutations sure to keep fans buying books and St. Martin's Press happy.ly following Plum's keystone-cop antics, some significant deviation from the pattern would be welcomed.

Names of prison camps, Rovno, Ternopol, Zitomir; names of occupied villages, Braslav, Balvi, Vigala; names of death camps, Auschwitz, Sobibor, Treblinka; names of dead comrades ...; names of fathers and mothers, brothers, women. The Red soldiers vent themselves on the Germans ... They have debts to collect ... One of the Germans mutters in Russian, `Bastards' ... All of these men hate. Back and forth, volleys of loathing ... One of the Russians raises his rifle to his cheek, ridiculous, as though he needs to aim this close to his targets ... Ilya's mouth is bone dry. He could speak ... He could say, what? ...Another crow dispatches his voice from the trees ... Ilya turns his back.\\"<br /><br />Debts. Oh, yes. THE FALL OF BERLIN 1945 by Antony Beevor is the true account of the savage retribution visited on the Third Reich and its capital by avenging armies from the East.<br /><br />At 431 paperbacked pages, THE FALL OF BERLIN 1945 hasn't the length to be overly detailed. Rather, as Beevor might put it, it's \\"the tidy version of events - the staff officer's summary.\\" The narrative could arbitrarily be divided into five sections: the Red Army's assault across the Vistula River into western Poland to the German border at the Oder River, the defeat of the Nazi armies along the Baltic in East Prussia and Pomerania, the final drive across the Oder to Berlin by the 1st Belorussian and 1st Ukranian Fronts, the fighting within the city itself, and the immediate aftermath of the German surrender. Relatively little is said of the conflict on the Western Europe except as it contributed to Stalin's paranoia about a separate peace treaty between Germany and the Western Allies and/or the possibility that the Anglo-American forces might reach Berlin first. Stalin needn't have worried about the latter. Eisenhower's political and strategic naivet&eacute;, and a misplaced desire to keep Uncle Joe a happy camper, assured a halt of the western armies on the Elbe River.<br /><br />The bare bones of the narrative are fleshed out with details derived from a multitude of other written sources and the author's interviews with survivors, especially evident in those sections relating to events in Hitler's Reich Chancellery bunker both before and after his suicide.<br /><br />The book includes a number of maps that are perfectly adequate, and three photo sections.

Darn, and I did that only yesterday!<br /><br /> Best-selling author Jane Stern is a columnist for GOURMET mag, and, with her husband, is a regular guest on National Public Radio. By her own admission, she is, or was, also something of a Sad Sack: afraid of airplanes and buses and so depressed as to not even shed her bathrobe and fuzzy slippers and leave the house on a daily basis. So, she begins seeing a shrink and, as sort of a personal dare, decides to become an Emergency Medical Technician. AMBULANCE GIRL is the story of her determination to get out more.<br /><br /> Stern's life takes on a whole new dimension as she attends EMT &quot;boot camp&quot;, takes the national certification exam (which she passes), gets hired by her hometown EMT force, learns to get along with firemen, begins to go out on emergency calls, and encounters her &quot;firsts&quot;. Her first accident victim, her first dead patient, her first AIDS sufferer, her first &quot;crazy person&quot;, her first suicide, her first dead dog, etc. (Dog?!)<br /><br /> The first three-quarters of the book is pretty much a hoot, then becomes more somber during the remainder as Jane describes the burn-out that puts a severe strain on her marriage and threatens to return her to a permanently depressed state. It's apparent by the book's conclusion that Stern's existence tottering on the edge of total dysfunction is a constant not easily ameliorated. (Perhaps that can be said of all of us.) Only her ability to share her life and experiences with a self-deprecating humor saves AMBULANCE GIRL from being a downer.<br /><br /> At 228 pages in relatively large type, this hardback is a very quick and entertaining read, allowing you to soon move on to something either more substantive or trashy depending on your taste.	2004-08-05

Anything as hard to grasp as the fact that these two over-the-hill players, permanently on the disabled list, were once in the starting lineup?&quot;<br /><br /> Who better to ask this rhetorical question than Calliope &quot;Cal&quot; Stephanides, the protagonist of MIDDLESEX? Cal, who's the genetically challenged offspring derived from two generations of inbreeding. His paternal grandparents were brother and sister; his parents were second cousins. And Cal, genetically a male (XY), is thus stricken with an autosomal recessive condition, 5-Alpha-Reductase Deficiency (5-ARD), which prevented in utero development of his male genitalia and left him superficially resembling a female in that area, but without the capacity to bear children.<br /><br /> MIDDLESEX, by Jeffrey Eugenides, is a charming and thoroughly engaging novel in four parts. First, Cal describes his grandparents' (Desdemona and Eleutherios) emigration from the Greek city of Smyrna (present day Izmir) in 1922 after it was overrun by the Turks, their marriage aboard ship on the way to New York, and, in part two, the courtship and marriage of his parents (Theodora and Milton) in Detroit in 1946. Then, in parts three and four, his upbringing as a girl and, finally, his life after the diagnosis of his condition at age fourteen and his subsequent agonizing decision to run away and live as a boy. Cal narrates all of this from the present, a forty-one year old man working for the U.S. State Department and stationed in Berlin.<br /><br /> I've only two niggling criticisms to make about an otherwise extraordinary story. First, since Eugenides is apparently of Greek heritage, and his story is about a Greek family, it isn't surprising that he should incorporate into the plot the Turkish capture of Smyrna in 1922, during which the victors engaged in an appalling orgy of looting, rape, and slaughter. But, since the event was so minor a part in the novel as a whole, the opportunity to take a slap at the hated Turks seems almost gratuitous. Finally, the author goes to great pains to describe 5-ARD as caused by a genetic mutation on chromosome 5. Perhaps he hasn't seen the following, taken directly from a medical journal article on the Web:<br /><br /> &quot;Two genes coding for 5-alpha-reductase have been identified, each for a slightly different isoenzyme. The gene for 5-alpha-reductase type 1 has been determined to be on chromosome 5 ... Linkage analysis has demonstrated that the type 1 enzyme is unrelated to the clinical syndrome of 5-ARD. The other isoenzyme, 5-alpha reductase type 2, determined on CHROMOSOME 2 (emphasis mine), correlates with clinical symptoms.&quot;<br /><br /> I haven't been left feeling so good about a book since CORELLI'S MANDOLIN. MIDDLESEX is alternately humorous, poignant, and tragic - just like Life itself. There are times when the author's story verges on brilliance, as when he describes what is certainly a most unusual seduction technique, one which Milton works on Theodora.

In NOAH'S FLOOD, oceanographers turned authors William Ryan and Walter Pitman propose an alternative scenario to Noah's tempest in a teapot.<br /><br /> With the help of other scientific disciplines - archeology, linguistics, geology, climatology, biology, paleoanthropology, paleography, paleontology - Ryan and Pitman hypothesize that the Great Flood tale in the Book of Genesis, as well as similar myths in older cultures, actually had as its source an apocalyptic flooding of the freshwater New Euxine Lake around 5,600 BC when the Adriatic, 500 feet above the lake, broke through the Bosporus isthmus and poured seawater into the former at a rate of ten cubic miles per day for at least a year, raising the lake's level six inches per day over that period, and forming the present-day Black Sea over perhaps two years. The water bill for that one must have been astronomical; don't try this at home.<br /><br /> The authors argue their case methodically. First, they describe a proven precedent, i.e. when the Atlantic breached the junction of North Africa and Spain at Gibraltar roughly 5 million years ago to flood a vast desert and create the Mediterranean. Second, they present data derived from underwater sonar scans and seabed core sampling that give evidence of a Black Sea basin that was originally a glacial melt-water repository, which subsequently shrunk through evaporation until it was those hundreds of feet below an Adriatic Sea swelling (like the rest of the Earth's oceans at the time) with that same glacial runoff. Third, they postulate the nature of the human residents that bore witness to the inundation of their lakeside homes and fields and subsequently fled towards all points of the compass to higher ground. And, more importantly, how the collective memories of the event were preserved and transmitted down through subsequent centuries in oral and written tradition. How far did those refugees flee? Amazingly, Ryan and Pitman have them and their immediate descendents traveling as far west as Paris, as far south as Egypt, and as far east as Chinese Turkestan.<br /><br /> The book included a few small maps, which were adequate, and some scattered drawings, some apparently based on photographs, that were pretty much useless as illustrative aids.<br /><br /> NOAH'S FLOOD is a fascinating and convincing exposition, especially if you don't take the Bible's Noah as &quot;gospel&quot; and you haven't been exposed to any other scientific explanation of the event. (I don't and haven't, and don't intend to ponder further an ancient people's mad rush to the boats. One credible explanation is satisfying enough. I'll leave the controversy surrounding the Ryan-Pitman theory to the theologians, historians, and scientists, who have turf to defend to the death.)as far west as Paris, as far south as Egypt, and as far east as Chinese Turkestan.

Expected to work a zillion-hour week, she doesn't have a life outside her scrubs. She's the epitome of boring. Her only contact with the outside world is her platonic male roomy and friend, Leo, an extremely popular pediatric RN at the same institution. Alice doesn't have a boyfriend, much less a pet goldfish.<br /><br /> One day while rotating through Plastic Surgery, Alice is consulted by a forty-year old widower, Ray Russo, seeking advice about a nose job. After being talked out of it, Ray embarks on his romantic pursuit of Thrift. Russo is a fudge salesman. Or so he says. He's also extraordinarily glib, and, obviously to everyone but Alice, up to something.<br /><br /> The problem with THE PURSUIT OF ALICE THRIFT is threefold. The ending is revealed on page 6 when Thrift tells the reader that Ray is a &quot;LIAR&quot;, and that they had a failed marriage. One only reads further in hope of learning the sordid details. Secondly, Alice is numbingly ordinary. Having that goldfish, or even a tabletop ant farm, might have made her more interesting. And her social interactions with more socially developed friends and colleagues are only marginally amusing. Finally, since this is a story about the poor decisions a person makes to escape the throes of loneliness, it shouldn't be revelation to any reasonably contemplative individual beyond adolescence. Indeed, on finishing this novel, the average reader should be able to state, &quot;Yup. Been there; done that; will likely do it again.&quot;<br /><br /> THE PURSUIT OF ALICE THRIFT isn't a bad book, just decidedly so-so.	2004-07-20
585296:US	53075086	R3JCVNIMXJS4YE	0553583123	956860008	Last Citadel: A Novel of the Battle of Kursk	Books	4	2	3	N	Y	Gotterdammerung amidst the sunflowers	In a previous historical novel, THE WAR OF THE RATS, author David Robbins took us to the 1942 siege of Stalingrad on World War Two's Eastern Front, one usually paid scant attention by American readers who perhaps believe that U.S. won the European war single-handed. It didn't, you know. Now, in LAST CITADEL, Robbins returns to the Eastern Front for history's greatest tank battle.<br />It's July 1943, and Hitler throws one last roll of the dice against the USSR with a major armored offensive designed to capture the city of Kursk. America is about to invade Italy, and Germany must knock the Soviets out of the war, or at least stabilize that front, before having to withdraw some of its forces from the East to reinforce the Mediterranean theater.<br />Whereas in THE WAR OF THE RATS, the confrontation in Stalingrad's rubble was between two master snipers, one German and one Russian, the LAST CITADEL evolves into the ultimate confrontation  in a field of sunflowers between two tank crews, one German in the awesome Tiger tank and one Russian in the smaller but faster T-34.<br />The Tiger is commanded by SS Captain Luis Ruiz de Vega of the 1st SS Panzergrenadiers, one of three SS armored divisions spearheading the German assault. De Vega originally came to fight for the Nazis with the Spanish Blue Division, lent to Hitler by Franco in 1941. Having lost half his stomach to a Russian sniper during the siege of Leningrad, de Vega was rewarded with a commission in the SS. Now, bitter, constantly hungry, increasingly emaciated, and emotionally dead, Luis dreams only of returning to Spain a war hero.<br />The T-34 is commanded by Sgt. Valentin Berko, but its soul is its driver, Cpl. Dimitri Berko, Valentin's father. Dimitri is an old Cossack who's fought against the Czar, Trotsky's Red Army, and now the Germans. The elder Berko loves his son dearly, but is disgusted with the latter's unquestioning dedication to Communism. But the two together make a formidable fighting team.<br />In THE WAR OF THE RATS, a five-star novel, subplots added to the overall storyline, especially as military sniping involves a lot of waiting for the perfect shot. In contrast, several subplots in LAST CITADEL only serve as unnecessary distractions. Dimitri's daughter, Katya, is a bomber pilot attached to the Night Witches, who fly biplanes so slow and flimsy that they can only operate at night. Her boyfriend, Leonid, also a pilot, but in a modern squadron, is shot down. Attempting a landing behind enemy lines to rescue him, Katya crashes, and subsequently falls in with a group of Russian partisans, which has an unidentified traitor in its midst. In the meantime, SS Colonel Abram Breit, is spying for the Soviet's Lucy network.<br />Had Robbins focused entirely on the tank engagements of the Kursk battle, his book, in my opinion, would have been leaner, meaner, and better.  In any case, his description of going to war in the Tiger and T-34 makes for an absorbing and informative read./>In THE WAR OF THE RATS, a five-star novel, subplots added to the overall storyline, especially as military sniping involves a lot of waiting for the perfect shot.

A bully book about a bully President	As this work of popular history by Edmund Morris begins, it's the early morning of 14 September 1901. President McKinley lies dying in Buffalo, NY, mortally wounded by an assassin's bullet. Vice President Theodore Roosevelt is on his way by buckboard and train from his isolated vacation cabin in Upper Tahawus, NY. Over the next 7 years and 169 days, THEODORE REX would drag and shove the United States into the twentieth century.<br />Unlike perhaps other biographies of TR, this one only hints at his life before his ascendancy to the White House, and ends somewhat abruptly on the day he transferred the mantle of power to William Howard Taft on 4 March 1909. In between, Morris hits all the high points of Roosevelt's two administrations: acquisition of the rights to build the Panama Canal, settlement of the 1902 coal strike, arbitration of the treaty ending the Russo-Japanese War, build-up of the American Navy, establishment of Cuban independence, and the calling of a national conservation conference. And certainly the low point - Theodore's response to the 1906 Brownsville Incident, wherein 20-30 Black troops of the 25th U.S. Infantry allegedly went on a shooting rampage in that Texas town.<br />One of the strengths of the author's prose is that it never becomes ponderous. Indeed, at times, it approaches oddly lyrical, as when he describes the signing of the canal treaty between newly independent Panama and the U.S.:<br />&quot;Pens scratched across parchment. Wax melted on silk. Two oceans brimmed closer, ready to spill.&quot;<br />THEODORE REX isn't solely about great affairs of State. Did you know that both Teddy and his eldest daughter, Alice, habitually carried pistols. What would today's anti-gun lobby make of that!<br />The book also serves to dispel a Hollywood myth regarding the 1904 Perdicaris Affair, in which an American citizen in Tangier was kidnapped by the desert insurgent Ahmed ben Mohammed el Raisuli, an event memorialized in celluloid by the vastly entertaining 1975 film, THE WIND AND THE LION, starring Candice Bergen and Sean Connery. Had the movie been more true to fact, Ms. Bergen couldn't have played the role unless dressed in drag.<br />With my short attention span and too many books waiting on the shelf, this narrative of Roosevelt's Presidency is just about as good as it gets. At 555 paperback pages, it's long, but not too long to bog me down for weeks. It's detailed, compiled from a nine-page bibliography of sources, but not so detailed as to become tedious. And it's got photographs - one or two in each of its thirty-two chapters. At the book's conclusion, I felt I had a satisfactory appreciation of Teddy the man, and was glad I'd taken the opportunity to pick up this excellent volume. My only criticism is the lack of a brief post-epilogue noting Teddy's abortive 1912 attempt to regain the Presidency at the head of the Bull Moose Party, thus splitting the Republican vote and handing the election to Woodrow Wilson, which would have perhaps better rounded out the saga.<br />Bully!entertaining 1975 film, THE WIND AND THE LION, starring Candice Bergen and Sean Connery.

The lesson here, guys, is destroy all pictures of yourself and old girlfriends.<br />Dr. Marc Seidman, a plastic surgeon specializing in maxillo-facial reconstruction, wakes up in the hospital after being shot in the head one morning, apparently by a home intruder, while he was eating a granola bar over the kitchen sink. As he soon learns, his wife, Monica, was killed in the same incident, and his daughter, Tara, abducted. Soon after Marc's release, his filthy-rich father-in-law gets a ransom demand for two million bucks. The kidnappers stress that the authorities aren't to be involved, and there'll be NO SECOND CHANCE. However, Seidman brings in the cops. Subsequently, the abductors make off with the ransom and Tara isn't returned. Devastated, Marc attempts to rebuild his life and assumes his daughter is permanently lost. That is, until eighteen months later when a second ransom demand arrives with the note &quot;Want one last chance?&quot; In the meantime, local law enforcement and the FBI suspect Seidman was the mastermind behind a plot to rid himself of Monica, scam her Dad out of a fortune, and has Tara hidden away.<br />As this complicated thriller evolves, author Harlan Coben provides plot twists around every corner and includes Marc's drug-addled sister, a long-lost old flame from his college days, his best male pal, and an ex-grade school classmate emotionally crippled from too much teasing on the playground, plus a deranged former child actress and her current lover, a sleazy adoption lawyer, and a Serbian reformed hooker and her American redneck husband. Sounds like the friends my wife and I hang out with at the bowling alley every Thursday night.<br />NO SECOND CHANCE is a thriller that'll keep you furtively turning the pages under the edge of the desk at work; that crucial report that the Boss needed yesterday can wait. And, if the book isn't finished by quitting time, the spouse better call that fancy restaurant and cancel the twenty-fifth wedding anniversary dinner because you need more time alone.<br />As Coben roared down the stretch through the final pages, there was a bad moment when I thought he was going to try too hard to wrap up all the loose ends, mete justice out to all the scum, and have the decent, God-fearin' folks all live happily ever after. But he resisted the impulse, and, in my opinion, that makes NO SECOND CHANCE a cut above the rest.

You order the steak and the hamburger and the sushi because chances are they might be out of something. They might be out of everything. The main thing is, you have to eat or die.&quot; I was in Moscow in 1984, and I can attest to the aptness of the simile.<br />The LOVE MONKEY isn't a comprehensive examination of Tom's sexuality, but it is a humorous and breezy read suitable for the beach or the round trip commute to work on public transportation. Since it's so general, men reading it may see a lot of Farrell in themselves (or, if advancing into that age bracket of decreasing testosterone, remember the hyper-libidinous state wistfully). Women reading it will perhaps be reminded of what it is that makes the male of the species so infuriatingly obtuse and porcine.<br />The superficiality of the book an acceptable given, its otherwise biggest flaw, for me, is that Tom comes across as neither likable or dislikable. He just IS, in all his glory as Average Any Man. Indeed, male readers who've lost sight of their commonality with the rest of  their gender, and who consider themselves &quot;successful&quot;, will label Tom a &quot;loser&quot;. Perhaps. But I suspect that he's also a resilient survivor who'll one day do his part in perpetuating the species.<br />The last line of the book is an observation by Tom which has potential as a perceptive insight if he cared to think about it. Wandering the streets alone, he passes a corner that represents for him a particularly cherished memory of his time with  Julia - an incident when she was happy and playful. It sticks in his mind &quot;because she (wanted) to be with me&quot;.

The go-between is a 22-year old I Corps junior stenographer, Corporal Tracy Barnes, who becomes Becker's lover. Becker is sent by his controller to East Germany's Baltic coast to glean information from radar base signals. There, Hans is captured and brutally murdered by Stasi Counter Espionage Captain Dieter Krause. Barnes suspects Krause's guilt, but can't prove it. And Hans remains the first and only man that Tracy has ever slept with.<br />Now, it's a decade later. The Berlin Wall is rubble, Germany is re-united, and Dieter Krause is the new darling of the German intelligence service, the BfV, because of the information he can provide on an old friend, Russian Army Colonel Pyotr Rykov, who's the influential personal assistant to the Russian Defense Minister. The Germans are showing Krause off, first to the Brits, then the Yanks. However, during a visit to the I Corps base in Ashford, Kent, Dieter is recognized by Barnes, who physically attacks him. Clapped into the base guardhouse, Tracy is interrogated by a veteran SIS man sent down from London, Albert Perkins of German Desk, but he gets nothing. Released from detention, Barnes goes to Germany to unearth the evidence to bring Dieter down. She's accompanied by Josh Mantle, a solicitor's clerk persuaded to the task by Tracy's mother. Josh, at 54, was once of I Corps, then of the Royal Military Police. Stubbornly his own man and awkwardly dedicated to principles, Mantle was discarded by the Army at the end of the Cold War. Now, he's tired and on the ash heap of imminent old age. Against his better judgement, but always for the underdog, Tracy's dangerous mission demands his participation.<br />THE WAITING TIME at first begins as a relatively simple tale of long-delayed justice. Well, ok, vengeance. But &quot;simplistic&quot; is never an apt description of Gerald Seymour's thrillers. Tracy's implacable, single-minded quest becomes almost a sideshow as Perkins, following Barnes and Mantle to Germany, has his own agenda to put the upstart BfV back into &quot;its place&quot;. And another scarred veteran of the Cold War, the iron-haired and intimidating Olive Harris of the SIS Russian Desk, convinces the MI6 wallahs to activate her own scheme, i.e. to topple Pyotr Rykov (which would render Krause's humint pretty much valueless).<br />I'm a huge fan of Seymour's novels. But, in THE WAITING TIME, I reluctantly suggest that the plot is too complicated. He should've left out the Harris gambit and focused solely on Perkins, Mantle, Barnes, and Krause. When Olive arrives in Moscow to administer the coup de grace to Rykov, the local SIS station head asks, &quot;Why are we mounting a hostile operation against Pyotr Rykov? ... Your game is the immediate destruction of a fine man.&quot; That just about says it all, and perhaps the only usefulness of the subplot is to illustrate that &quot;our side&quot; (and the gentler sex) can be just as ruthless as &quot;their side&quot; when it comes to destroying a man.<br />Seymour's forte is showing that victory is often Pyrrhic. The most tragic victor of this story is undoubtedly Mantle, self-crucified on the Cross of Principle. You might think that role would be Tracy's, but, as the reader learns in a surprise ending, she's not what she appears to be through 99% of the novel.<br />Overall, a jolly good show.

One of the first to record his experiences was Thomas Coryate, who made the 5-month roundtrip from his Somerset home to Venice in 1608. His travelogue was subsequently published as \\"Coryats Crudities\\" in 1611. In the autumn and early winter of 2000, author Tim Moore retraced Coryate's route, and tells us all about it in THE GRAND TOUR.<br /><br />Moore's outbound route takes him to Venice via Montreuil, Amiens, Paris, Fontainebleau, Nevers, Lyon, Chamb&eacute;ry, Mont Cenis, Turin, Milan, Cremona, and Padua. Homeward bound, Tim transits Garda, Bergamo, Como, Spl&uuml;gen Pass, Chur, Zurich, Basel, Strasbourg, Durlach, Heidelberg, Worms, Mainz, Frankfurt, Coblenz, Bonn, Cologne, Emmerich, Nijmegen, Dordrecht, and Zierikzee.<br /><br />Any travel narrative is made invariably more entertaining if spiced with tales of hardship. Moore's is no exception, though his travails were largely self-imposed. Choosing to journey in shabby style, he purchased a clapped-out, 1980 Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow for 4,750 pounds sterling, with a subsequent 2,186 in necessary repairs to make it roadworthy and presentable. By the end of his Grand Tour, after 3,142 miles, the Roller had reduced the author to pitiful whimpering. Frugal by nature, or the acquisition of wheels having reduced him to penury, or both, Moore spends most nights either sleeping in his car or in fleabag hotels that barely reach the level of \\"budget accommodations\\". Personal hygiene was often maintained by a dip in the local, public swimming pool. The tone of much of his adventure is well represented by his decision to emulate Coryate and walk the 50 kilometer Mainz-Frankfurt leg. Thus:<br /><br />\\"The shoes were becoming an issue. I thought the idea was that they would mould themselves to the shape of my foot, but their plastic rigidity meant the process was being reversed. I'm not sure if it is possible to limp on both legs, but as it started to get dark ... I gave it my best shot.\\" Later, in his hotel room:<br /><br />\\"Peeling away my socks was more like removing a dressing ...\\"<br /><br />Despite elements of Tim's adventure which perhaps make it more resemble Napoleon's retreat from Moscow or the Bataan Death March, his dryly-witty commentary makes THE GRAND TOUR eminently readable. And I'm ever delighted to encounter British slang: knackered (exhausted), bog (toilet), ponce (dandy, to strut), neck-down (drink). My chief complaint, which increasingly annoys me the more travel essays I read, is that there's no photo section. Perhaps publishers think the inclusion of such would render a book too pricey for the average reader.<br /><br />A fitting conclusion is the Epilogue, which summarizes Coryate's life after his return. After struggling to get his book published in the face of ridicule from his social betters, he left England again in 1614, and became the first European since Alexander to walk the 3,300 miles from Jerusalem to India. Dying in 1617 at age forty, he's buried in an uninscribed, domed sarcophagus near Surat marked on East India Company charts, and still labeled on current maps, as \\"Tom Coryat's Tomb\\".o the shape of my foot, but their plastic rigidity meant the process was being reversed.

Sounds like a Japanese brand adhesive.<br />I've seen several of the 007 films with a wide range of actors - Connery, Moore, and Brosnan. However, this is the first Bond book by Ian Fleming that I've ever read. I'm left marveling at the liberties taken by Hollywood with the hero. Is this truly Bond - JAMES Bond - the Suave Super Stud Super Spy of the Big Screen?<br />In YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, the redoubtable Commander is about to be fired by &quot;M&quot; for a recently unacceptable job performance brought on by the murder of the former's wife. (There was a Mrs. 007?!) But &quot;M&quot; is persuaded by the house shrink to send his agent on one more mission - one that will be touted as so impossible that James will be challenged enough to snap out of his funk. So, off Bond goes to Japan to persuade the head of that nation's Secret Service to share information from a key Soviet source - information only otherwise being shared with the CIA. Bond befriends the Japanese spymaster, &quot;Tiger&quot; Tanaka, who consents to the new  arrangement if 007 will carry out a special and very dangerous assignment.<br />Relative to the Bond movies, I liked the in-print character much better; he's less of a comic book hero and more real. And there's not an improbable high-tech gadget in sight. However, that being said, Fleming's original 007 is much less developed and complex than, say, the Quiller persona created by Adam Hall (the nom de plume of Elleston Trevor) during the 60s and 70s. Quiller was a lonely, scarred, and bloody-minded agent who, when sent off on a perilous mission, managed make it alive out of the dodgy spots - whether it was being chased by attack dogs across the no-man's land of the East German border or bundled unceremoniously into the Lubyanka basement - purely on luck, innate ability, and pure survival sense. Quiller didn't even carry a gun. And Quiller had the hint of a secret life, perhaps one in the past; his will on file with the Secret Service specified that roses should be sent to &quot;Moira&quot; in the event of his death. And the reader never found out who Moira was during the entire Quiller series of nineteen books. Bond, on the other hand, just doesn't run that deep. Indeed, Quiller would think 007 a poofter dilettante.<br />YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, as an example of Fleming's source material for the Bond cinematic legend, is perhaps only of interest if you want to see the tenor of the original character before the Tinseltown scriptwriters got hold of him.

The difference is, of course, that much of the humor in a live stand-up routine revolves around the performer's delivery, facial expressions, and body language. Here, each chapter is at least headed by one of four face shots of Gillespie that reappear in a regular sequence. One is of a pleasingly smiling Hollis. The second shows a teeth-baring grimace. The final two show Gillespie sticking her tongue out at the reader - in one she looks ill, and in the other she appears insulting. My immediate reaction to the latter two was \\"Classy broad!\\" Since, judging from other photos in the book of the author, her parents, and her friends, Hollis is not unattractive, I'm not sure why she included the grimace and tongue shots except to demonstrate that she has \\"an attitude\\". Fair enough.<br /><br />It seems everything about Gillespie's life has been dysfunctional. Her brilliant Mom was a government missile designer who was apt to feed Hollis and her siblings a bowl of Halloween candy for breakfast because she couldn't cook. Her alcoholic Dad was a generally-unemployed trailer salesman. Currently, Hollis describes herself as a part-time airline attendant and foreign language interpreter, and that's about as \\"normal\\" as it gets. Otherwise, she describes her adolescent fling with drugs, her occasional descents into alcoholic drunkenness, and her bad financial credit. Apparently, she's incapable of an intimate relationship with a member of the opposite sex, but rather hangs out with, and devotes much of the book to, three equally dysfunctional male friends - Lary, Daniel and Grant.<br /><br />BHHB is funny at first, but it becomes tiresome at about the half-way point. And, by the time she describes the run-down Atlanta neighborhood, where she buys a fixer-upper home, as an area \\"in which people were clamoring for in-town property like feral hogs set free in a field of sleeping newborn babies\\", I also began to wonder what sort of person would come up with such an unhealthy analogy.<br /><br />Hollis occasionally demonstrates bursts of insight, as when she writes:<br /><br />\\"... I'm old enough to have a box of broken dreams all my own ... You need to look inside that box sometimes and see what isn't beyond mending.\\"<br /><br />Finally, Gillespie is perhaps at her most engaging at the end of the very last chapter when she describes her last comfort rendered to her dying mother. At that point, I almost began to like her.<br /><br />Memoirs can be both humorous and perceptive without being unkind. Take SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS by Laura Shaine Cunningham as a fine example. One's views of the world can also be both humorous and sharply pointed without being self-flagellating, such as THE ROAD TO MCCARTHY by Pete McCarthy.<br /><br />BLEACHY-HAIRED HONKY BITCH may grow on you, but it didn't on me.he time she describes the run-down Atlanta neighborhood, where she buys a fixer-upper home, as an area \\"in which people were clamoring for in-town property like feral hogs set free in a field of sleeping newborn babies\\", I also began to wonder what sort of person would come up with such an unhealthy analogy.

Fortey's account necessarily leaves off with the beginning of recorded history. (Blessedly, the life forms &quot;Benifer&quot; and Michael Jackson fail to appear in the narrative even once.)<br />The author hits the high points, including the evolution of single cells, the formation of bacterial colonies, the initiation of chlorophyll-based photosynthesis (that ultimately charged the atmosphere with oxygen), the specialization of cells into tissues, the population of the seas, the advance onto land, the greening of the earth, the separation of ancient Pangaea into today's separate continents, the Age of Dinosaurs, the advent of live-birth from wombs, the ascendancy of mammals, and finally the evolution of Man. For me, the most interesting chapter was on the apocalyptic cataclysm which ended the Age of Dinosaurs, i.e. the asteroid which apparently slammed into the Mexican Yucatan Peninsula creating the Chicxulub Crater. The volume also includes several photo sections that provide an adequate visual summary of the text.<br />The time spans of Fortey's tale are almost beyond mental grasp. For instance, at one point the author states that tool making by hominids began about 2.5 million years ago. Yet the style of the tools, the &quot;technology&quot; if you will, then remained virtually unchanged for the next million years. After witnessing the dizzying pace of technological advancement just during the span of my own life, this stagnation for such an incomprehensible length of time is mind-boggling.<br />I wish I had but a fraction of Fortey's knowledge of our world.

It's Stephanie at her wackiest.<br />Plum is a disaster-prone bounty hunter working for her cousin Vinnie, a bail bondsman in Trenton, NJ. In this novel, Stephanie volunteers to help out her parents' next door neighbor, Mabel, who's put up her home to guarantee a child custody bond taken out on her granddaughter, Evelyn, who had one imposed on her by the judge in a recent divorce ruling. Now, Evelyn has skipped town with her daughter, Annie, and Mabel will be tossed into the street if the missing child isn't found. But, as becomes evident in all of Stephanie's adventures, there's more to the story than is obvious. Especially after the corpse of Evelyn's aggrieved husband, Steven, is left on the couch of Plum's apartment. Steven had been sawed in half.<br />The imagination of author Janet Evanovich worked overtime in making HARD EIGHT perhaps one of the craziest to date. It's a nice touch that Stephanie faces off against a virtual menagerie. And she's finally beginning to take her .38, usually kept unloaded in a cookie jar, seriously. And her unfortunate association with fire-bombed vehicles reaches a record high. Notwithstanding these plot devices, however, books one to eight in the series are basically interchangeable. (I'm struggling, perhaps unsuccessfully, to keep from writing the same review over and over.)<br />Evanovich needs to mature her heroine, who seems to have a slow learning curve. I suggest that Plum finally marry, or at least permanently set up house, with Detective Joe Morelli. It might not be a relationship made in heaven, but it would supply grist for any number of new episodes. And Lula, Stephanie's sometime partner in her Keystone Cop takedowns, is growing tiresome, as is the fact that the author refuses to bring Stephanie's Dad more into the limelight.<br />Mind you, I'm still finding the Plum novels immensely enjoyable in a mindless sort of way. But even the best of a good thing, like a premium chocolate chip cookie, begins to get stale after awhile. Perhaps I've read too many in too short a time, and should alternate with the likes of WAR AND PEACE and the works of Plato.of a good thing, like a premium chocolate chip cookie, begins to get stale after awhile.

After featuring spies, political terrorists, assassins, and mercenaries during the 70s, 80s and 90s, author Gerald Seymour welcomes us to the new millennium with a crime kingpin toting cellphone and international ambitions.<br />Albert William Packer, known to all and addressed as &quot;Mister&quot;, has ruthlessly climbed to the top of London's drug trade. Mister isn't above personally chainsawing the legs or snipping the fingers off rivals. His only friends are his wife, The Princess, and his chief lieutenant, The Cruncher.<br />Through bribery and witness intimidation, Mister has just evaded conviction by Crown prosecutors on evidence gathered during a 3-year investigation by Customs &amp; Excise, otherwise known as &quot;the Church&quot;. Mister considers himself untouchable by the law.<br />While Packer was in custody awaiting the Old Bailey's verdict, the Cruncher was off in the Balkans preparing the ground for Mister's expansion into the overseas heroin trade. Now, Mister is free, but the Cruncher is dead, his body having mysteriously turned up in the river that runs through Sarajevo. So, with a couple of hired hands, including his lawyer, Packer sets out for Sarajevo to finish uncompleted business. He's trailed by Joey Cann, the most junior member of the new Church action group tasked with gathering the evidence necessary to bring Mister down. Cann is accompanied by a covert surveillance specialist on loan from MI6, Maggie Bolton. Cann is the only representative from the previous Church team, since disbanded in disgrace, that recently failed to put Mister permanently away. Joey is obsessed with his quarry, and is determined not to fail this time out. While Packer may be the biggest fish in the small pool that's England, he's swimming an even bigger pond now, and is perhaps liable to mistakes.<br />There's another thread in THE UNTOUCHABLE that seems irrelevant. Beginning with a flashback to autumn 1991, and then moving forward in increments of months, the reader follows developments in a rural, Balkan river valley, one side Moslem, the other side Christian Serb. As the two populations embark on the vicious ethnic cleansing that stretched into the mid-90s, we watch the genesis and evolution of the minefield laid down on the Serb side of the river. The years pass, and the mines are washed into new positions by the rain. The minefield is almost a living thing, changing shape while maiming or killing whatever man or beast ventures into it even after the wider conflict ceases.<br />Seymour is, and remains, one of my very favorite authors. But, in THE UNTOUCHABLE, he makes no effort to make his protagonist, Joey Cann, in any way likable. Joey is an unsociable, driven geek with a bad attitude. Maggie might have been the more sympathetic &quot;hero&quot;, but the author chooses not to go there. On the other hand, Mister is, on very rare occasions, almost engaging when he's not being a vicious SOB.<br />Cann's final confrontation with Mister is one of the most imaginative I've read in awhile, and, coming from an author who specializes in plot-ending Pyrrhic victories, gives new meaning to the word &quot;Pyrrhic&quot;. To be honest, I'm not completely happy with this thriller's conclusion, but it'll probably grow on me after I've thought about it.ader follows developments in a rural, Balkan river valley, one side Moslem, the other side Christian Serb.

If the wind and tide ran the wrong way, scum coated the surface. Overfishing had killed off much of the marine life. Fresh water was so scarce it had to be cut off each night from nine P.M. to five A.M.&quot;<br />Such is the contemporary description in BLUE LATITUDES of the over-developed Bora-Bora lagoon, one of Captain James Cook's Polynesian landfalls in the summer of 1769.<br />During the period 1768 to 1779 at the behest of the British Admiralty, Cook of the Royal Navy captained three 3-year voyages to the Pacific Ocean in attempts to discover either the continent rumored to be at the bottom of the world, or the much-sought Northwest Passage to Asia. Cook found neither, but he was the first European to see and chart many of the islands and landmass margins in that vast watery expanse. In BLUE LATITUDES, author Tony Horwitz follows in Cook's wake to the most celebrated of the latter's landfalls, both north and south: Tahiti, Bora-Bora, New Zealand, Botany Bay (Australia), the Great Barrier Reef, Niue, Tonga, Unalaska (in the Aleutians), and Hawaii.<br />To my tastes, this book is a near-perfect travel essay. Not only are Cook's experiences described from the author's study of the great explorer's journals, but Horwitz paints a present-day picture of places that I'll likely never visit except in my mind's eye. And he writes with humor and perception. So, I'm both educated and entertained; it doesn't get better than that. The only thing lacking is a photo section - something illogically missing from too many travel narratives on the bookshelves. (Why most travel writers neglect to provide visual reinforcement remains a mystery to me.)<br />Tony begins his book with a nice touch - his personal agony during five days as a volunteer sailor aboard a full-scale reconstruction of Cook's first ship, The Endeavor, as it sailed from Gig Harbor, WA, to Vancouver, BC. At the end of his short voyage, Horwitz and the reader marvel at the endurance of the 19th century swabbie during literally years at sea because, as the author describes himself:<br />&quot;My hands were so swollen and raw that I couldn't make a fist or do the buttons on my shirt. Every limb throbbed. My eyes twitched and blurred from fatigue ... (I had) tar stuck in my hair (and) grime embedded in every inch of exposed skin.&quot;<br />Two-thirds of the way through the volume, in order to discover something of the inner Cook, Horwitz takes us to North Yorkshire, England, where the explorer was born in 1728, and where he took to sea from the Whitby docks in 1746 as a coal ship's apprentice. In the following chapter, it's on to London, where Cook lived with his wife between his celebrated voyages. Sadly, there are few genuine traces of the intrepid captain remaining on his home island.<br />Admittedly, the modern world has taken cruel toll on the exotic places that so captivated Cook and his crews. For example, Horwitz describes Papeete, Tahiti as an overpriced, congested mass of billboards, car fumes, crumbling sidewalks, litter, and ferroconcrete. Even the monument on the Hawaiian beach commemorating the spot of Cook's death at the hands of the natives is marred with graffiti and surrounded by trash.<br />Cook has been blamed by some as being the point man for West's destruction of Paradise. But, at the end of BLUE LATITUDES, this reader, at least, stands in awe of the man., to Vancouver, BC.

After his aged father was butchered by Vietcong soldiers for &quot;being a bad Communist&quot;, Nguyen defected with his wife and two daughters to the South, where his skills as a jungle killer were perfected in service with U.S. special forces. Unable to flee when the North finally overran Saigon in 1975, Nguyen spent nearly three years in a brutal &quot;re-education&quot; camp. Finally released, he immediately escaped with his family, now including a new 3-year old daughter. During the perilous boat trip to Hong Kong, Nguyen's two oldest daughters were killed by marauding Thai fishermen. Now, years later in London, Nguyen is owner of the Double Happiness Take-Away. One day, his wife and remaining daughter are shredded by an IRA bomb in Knightsbridge. Vowing personal revenge against the killers after the police are unable to nab the perps, Nguyen identifies Liam Hennessy as a top advisor to the IRA's political wing, the Sinn Fein. Traveling to Belfast, Nguyen demands of Hennessy the killers' names. Liam refuses &quot;The Chinaman&quot; because he simply doesn't know. Not to be put off, Nguyen relentlessly hounds Hennessy with a deliberate application of escalating violence designed to coerce revelation of the desired information.<br />Much of THE CHINAMAN revolves around the techniques of bombmaking and, in Nguyen's case, making detonators and explosives, including nitroglycerine, from scratch. This is probably not a casual hobby you'd want to take up at home.<br />The action moves back and forth between Nguyen's harassment of Liam in Northern Ireland and the continuing sequence of murderous blasts in and around London detonated by the IRA bombers. The British authorities are stymied. And, as it's revealed early on, so are Hennessy and the top IRA controllers in Dublin, who see the vicious attacks as counterproductive. The London IRA cell is unauthorized and anonymous, but drawing from existing ordinance caches in the UK and obviously helped by someone high in the organization. Liam is between a rock and a hard place.<br />THE CHINAMAN is an engaging and tautly written tale. My chief complaint is that, one-third of the way into the book, I knew with virtual certainty who was masterminding the rogue terrorism, and I wasn't proved wrong. I don't think author Stephen Leather intended it to be that obvious. On a pickier level, I thought the character of Kerry Geraghty superflous. Kerry is the daughter of an ex-IRA assassin retired to Scotland where he runs a survival school for the rich. Liam wants the elder Geraghty, an expert stalker, to come to Northern Ireland to help corner Nguyen, who's hidden himself in the countryside surrounding Hennessy's farm. But Geraghty has a broken leg, so he instead sends Kerry, who's as proficient as her Old Man at following large game animals. Kerry's contribution to the plot is contrived at best, though it provides some interesting insight into the expertise of tracking.<br />Finally, Nguyen remains a sympathetic character throughout, so the ending resembles those of Gerald Seymour's excellent novels in that victory, on a personal level, often proves Pyrrhic.blin, who see the vicious attacks as counterproductive.

But it's still surpasses most of the genre.<br />David, Moses, Rebecca and Isaac are young Jewish activists in Kiev in the former Soviet Union. David, the group's idealistic and charismatic leader, has, since childhood, drummed into the others the lesson of nearby Babi Yar. There, during WWII, the Nazis filled a ravine with the bodies of executed Jews. Now, David says, the Jews must fight their oppressors, including the present-day communist regime. Together they plan and carry out an attack on a local policeman, gravely wounding the officer with his own gun. But the assault is botched, the man lives, and Moses is identified as the shooter and arrested. The others, fearing imminent exposure during the torture Moses is sure to undergo, make a desperate escape to the West by hijacking at gunpoint an internal flight to Tashkent, during which the pilot is accidentally killed. Prevented from landing by West Germany, Holland, and France, the aircraft, flown by the female co-pilot and with 60+ innocent passengers aboard - including a group of school children - finally lands at England's Stansted airport north of London. Bargaining with their hostages' lives, the now desperate hijackers demand fuel to take the plane to Israel.<br />Moscow demands the return of the trio for trial (and, presumably, execution) in the strongest terms. The Israeli government, mindful of the pilot's murder, tells Her Majesty's Foreign Office that they won't accept the hijackers, but would rather they surrender and face punishment in the UK, which no longer has the death penalty. Whitehall is in a dodgy spot.<br />As with all of Gerald Seymour's novels, the focus, figuratively speaking, is on the ordinary foot soldier, who suddenly finds himself at the frontline facing an enemy to his front and pressure from high-ranking policy wallahs in the rear. In many of the author's stories, the bloke at the sharp end is a mid-level British civil servant. Thus, in KINGFISHER, it's Charlie Webster, a world-weary, former military counter-terrorist field officer now occupying sub-Desk Dissidents in MI-6's Soviet Desk. As the expert-on-the-spot, Charlie is co-opted by the Home Secretary to serve as communication point man at Stansted with David, Isaac and Rebecca.<br />At this late date, especially after 9/11, the concept of political dissidents hijacking a commercial airliner simply to get from point A to B is almost quaint. Perhaps when KINGFISHER was originally released, the plot had greater relevance, especially as the dissolution of the USSR and relative freedom for the country's Jews were still many years in the future.<br />KINGFISHER isn't as polished as some of Seymour's other books. (HOME RUN, perhaps his best, comes to mind.) Interesting characters are introduced, e.g. the co-pilot Anna Tashova and Israeli Defense Force Colonel Arie Benitz, whose involvement with the evolution of events, at least in my mind, fell sadly short of potential. Moreover, the author concludes this story by tying up loose ends. While this might be expected of other writers, it's somewhat atypical of Seymour, whose fictional worlds are usually like your's and mine in that they're neither black-and-white nor tidy. However, KINGFISHER demonstrates the concept that elevates all of Seymour's stories - victory in conflicts in the world's grotty seams is quite often Pyrrhic at the personal level.Thus, in KINGFISHER, it's Charlie Webster, a world-weary, former military counter-terrorist field officer now occupying sub-Desk Dissidents in MI-6's Soviet Desk.

Klutzy Stephanie often mistakes her can of hair set for pepper spray, and forgets to charge her stun gun. It's a wonder she captures anybody.<br />HOT SIX ended with undercover vice cop Joe Morelli proposing marriage - sort of.<br />In SEVEN UP, Vinnie assigns Plum to seize Eddie DeChooch, who's jumped bail on a charge of cigarette smuggling. But Eddie refuses to be brought in until he finds something he's lost, and he's willing to resort to gunplay to make his point. But Stephanie hates guns - she keeps her .38 in a cookie jar. And what has DeChooch lost? All we and Stephanie know is that it has to be kept cold. In the meantime, Plum must mentally grasp Morelli's marriage proposal. They've an on-again, off-again relationship ever since Joe took her virginity on the floor behind the pastry counter of the bakery where she worked at eighteen. Mrs. Plum, whose nightmare is her daughter as an Old Maid, takes Stephanie out to try on wedding gowns when the latter, in a desperate moment at the Plum family dinner table with guest Joe, blurts out &quot;August!&quot;. Will it happen, you think?<br />Now seven novels into the Stephanie Plum series, it's evident that Evanovich writes to a fairly rigid formula, at least so far: Plum gets an ostensibly easy assignment that goes terribly wrong when her quarry proves elusive and one or more bodies are discovered; Stephanie has car problems; Stephanie must temporarily put up with an eccentric roommate; Stephanie dotes on her pet hamster, Rex; Stephanie is followed by suspicious characters; Stephanie takes her Grandma Mazur to viewings at local funeral parlors; Stephanie's sidekick in dysfunctional fugitive apprehension is Lula, ex-ho and Vinnie's file clerk; Stephanie has the hots for fellow bounty hunter, the mysterious Ranger. Whatever fantastical situations and characters the author additionally creates seem to be outlandish for their own sakes rather than maturing her heroine's persona. While that's not necessarily bad, it does lend each book a strain of boring predictability. The author needs to expand Stephanie's horizons. And I'm becoming increasingly annoyed that Plum's long-suffering parents remain ciphers.<br />Mind you, I still enjoy Stephanie's adventures immensely. But I'm unwilling to award any more five-star ratings unless Evanovich provides something surprising or very clever.kes rather than maturing her heroine's persona.

(Interestingly, it was Smith that Plath attended a couple of years previous.) Specifically, Sylvia's alter ego, Esther Greenwood, is one of twelve college girls who've won a fashion magazine contest, the prize being a month-long, expense-paid, freebie-filled, glamorous job in New York City as the guest editor of a national magazine. When the month is up, Esther returns home where, under pressure to make something of her life during her senior year of college, she cracks. From that point on, the storyline progresses from half-hearted attempts at suicide to one that almost succeeds, then subsequent admission into a country-club asylum for psychotherapy and electroshock treatment. (Though THE BELL JAR never states, even in the chapter &quot;Sylvia Plath: A Biographical Note&quot;, the author's real life experience was at McLean Hospital.) It's while on her way to the private mental institution that Esther defines &quot;bell jar&quot;:<br />&quot;I would be sitting under the ... glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.&quot;<br />THE BELL JAR is a hypnotic look at the mental deterioration of a talented and intelligent young woman. It's like watching the slow-mo replay of a person's self-destructive plunge off a building's ledge. There's perhaps an argument here for the book being required reading by the parents of any teenage girl.<br />The literary world benefited when Sylvia Plath regained relative mental equilibrium long enough to write THE BELL JAR before succumbing to inner demons and committing suicide in 1963. Her ultimate fate renders even more poignant and prophetic her words:<br />&quot;How did I know that someday - at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere - the bell jar, with its stifling distortions, wouldn't descend again?&quot;uccumbing to inner demons and committing suicide in 1963.

The devils have the ability to move the hill from place to place via the wind, and its appearance is Heap Bad Medicine. Yeah, ok, but it's not given such significant play that it's worth getting excited about. Trust me.<br />This novel is the second in the Berrybender series, the first being SIN KILLER. Berrybender is Lord Albany Berrybender, an Englishmen who's come to the Great Plains of the 1830s to hunt accompanied by his wife Constance, six of their fourteen brats, the talking parrot Prince Talleyrand, and a rabble of servants, all traveling up the Yellowstone River by steamboat. By THE WANDERING HILL, Constance, one of the offspring, and several employees are dead or missing. The eldest of Berrybender's children along for the ride, daughter Tasmin, has married the Sin Killer, aka Jim Snow, a young, closed-mouthed, and excessively God-fearing trapper whose attitude towards his new wife, outside of their lovemaking, is boorish at best.<br />The biggest problem with the Berrybender series to date, and THE WANDERING HILL in particular, is that there's no strong unifying thread to the storyline. In McMurtry's magnificent LONESOME DOVE, there were also many subplots to be sure, but all eventually tied into Gus McCrae's and Woodrow Call's cattle drive from South Texas to Montana. In the Berrybender saga, we have only the intent of Lord Albany to continue on with his hunting expedition, which is proving to be a weak nail on which to hang the continuing story. In THE WANDERING HILL, they don't get far at all. Having left the confines of the riverboat, the Berrybender party spends over half the book at an Indian trading post, where Tasmin and Venetia Kennet, the group's cellist, have babies. Then, after some aimless wandering about, they subsequently all set off to an annual trapper rendezvous in the Rocky Mountain foothills.<br />THE WANDERING HILL even lacks a decent villain. In LONESOME DOVE, it was Blue Duck, a murderous half-breed. In SIN KILLER, it was Draga, a psychopathic, old, Aleut-Russian squaw who'd made it down to the Lower Forty-Eight. In this book, there's only relatively passing reference to The Partezon, a vicious Sioux chief on the rampage with a war party. Otherwise, the biggest danger is posed by the sudden appearance of several thousand stampeding buffalo. Yawn.<br />Since the overall direction of storyline is unremarkable, the reader must find limited enjoyment in the depiction of the various characters. And pickings are slim when it comes to engaging personae. Tasmin, the Lord's strong-willed, resilient daughter, is the most appealing of all. Next is perhaps Kit Carson, who, at this stage of his legendary career, is a tongue-tied, shy youth prone to complaining about minor hardships. Then there's the precocious, four-year old Kate Berrybender, who manages to win the heart of Jim Snow, who is, in my opinion, too much of a jerk to be a heroic figure. Lord Berrybender himself is so disagreeable a person that I wish he'd just die off or get killed. No such luck.<br />One newly introduced character whom I hope gets a larger role in the next book, BY SORROW'S RIVER, is the Sin Killer's inscrutable and too young Ute wife, Little Onion.<br />Despite my ambivalent feelings towards this second volume in the series, I'm certain that I'll continue reading to the end because of the plucky Tasmin.

I'm glad I did.<br />Gemma of Ireland is an event planner to the rich and shallow, who must deal with the loss of her boyfriend, Anton, to her one-time best friend, Lily, after the former moved to London and Gemma sent the latter to keep watch on him. Gemma's life is made more complicated when her Dad leaves Mom after thirty-five years of marriage to take up with a younger Babe, and when Gemma herself, on the rebound, beds a young and silly boy, Owen. A frustrated author, Gemma is also consumed with jealousy that Lily has managed to publish a novel. Via email, Gemma confides in another best-friend, Susan, who's emigrated to Seattle. Without asking Gemma, Susan, thinking they're the core of a good story, sends copies of this girl talk to ...<br />Jojo, a London literary agent. Jojo is employed by the firm Lipman Haigh, and desperately wants to become one of the managing partners, assuming she can beat out her insufferable rival, Richie Gant. Jojo hedges her bets by carrying on a lengthy affair with Mark Avery, a Lipman Haigh partner and Very Married With Childen. It also so happens that Jojo is the book agent for ...<br />Lily, Gemma's erstwhile pal, now living with Anton, with whom she's had a child. Lily is consumed with guilt for having betrayed Gemma. And, after Jojo reveals that she's taking Gemma on as a client, Lily wonders what dreadful revenge Gemma is plotting. In the meantime, however, Lily must cope with both Anton's insistence that they buy a horribly expensive dream house with the publisher's advance on her first book and the publisher's pressure for a second.<br />Each of these trans-gender relationships perhaps represents a dead-albatross-around-the-neck for the male reader. This is scary stuff. I mean, whatever happened to the simplicity of a sleazy but torrid one-night stand that can be quickly forgotten after the hang-over has worn off?

And not just books, mind you, but antiquarian books. Indeed, of the forty local bookstores existing at the time of this volume's writing, only one dealt in new releases. Hay's transformation from a sleepy border enclave to halfway house for old volumes in search of new owners is due to the efforts of Richard Booth, the eccentric owner of the local, semi-ruined castle. Apparently a Book Lover Extraordinaire, Booth buys and ships-in moldering tomes by the boatload. In any case, there are books everywhere: in precarious piles and on creaking shelves in the bookshops, stored in barns, in fields under tarps. Those that don't escape this Limbo to find new homes may ultimately be burned, dumped into a landfill, or left outdoors to disintegrate in the elements.<br />Into this setting from San Francisco comes author Paul Collins with wife Jennifer and toddler son Morgan. Their intent is to buy an old and charming home in Hay and take up permanent residence. Between navigating the peculiarly British pitfalls inherent to property purchase, sorting American literature in one of Booth's bookstores, and working on his own first book, BANVARD'S FOLLY, Paul shares droll (and usually brief) observations about many aspects of life in the UK, e.g. table manners, postal delivery, socialized medicine, fuel prices, trucking strikes, BBC television fare, newspapers, weather, cuisine, derelict churches, graveyards, Parliament, and the excellence of British chocolate. When Collins makes reference to specific books, they're almost invariably eighteenth, nineteenth or early twentieth century publications of obscure title. His longest reference to new books concerns their predictable packaging.

Readers who've been enchanted by the Becky Bloomwood character of Sophie Kinsella's SHOPAHOLIC series will not be disappointed by CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?<br />Emma Corrigan is a Junior Marketing Assistant in the London HQ of Panther Corporation, which makes, among other things, Panther Cola and Panther Bars. Sent solo to Glasgow to conclude the formalities of a marketing alliance with Glen Oil, thought to be a sure thing, the deal suddenly falls apart. Attempting to salvage the agreement, Emma spills a can of Panther Cola all over the shirt of a Glen Oil VIP. Distraught, Emma boards a plane for the flight back to London - and she's afraid of flying. Unusually strong air turbulence makes the flight terrifying. Her tongue loosened by the certainty of impending death, Emma blabs all her personal secrets to her seatmate, a reserved American. As a matter of fact, she spills her guts: her relationship with her boyfriend, girl roomies, family, and co-workers, and the details of her sex life, her underwear, and the little lie she put on her Panther Corp job application. You get the picture. Absolutely everything, including the fact that she accidentally killed her parents' pet goldfish and substituted a look-alike.<br />The following Monday, the quiet Yank shows up at Panther Corporation. As it turns out, he's multimillionaire Jack Harper, the company CEO and one of its co-founders, who's making a tour of his European offices. Corrigan's life will never be the same. But Jack has a secret also.<br />Except that Emma doesn't have Becky's relentlessly spendthrift habits, the two are soul sisters. Both are young, naive, just a little ditzy, otherwise intelligent, pretty, generous, charming, kind-hearted, and with a propensity for infinite self-deception. Both are incredibly endearing despite their faults.<br />Author Sophie Kinsella is a genius at creating absurd situations from which her heroines must extricate themselves. Her books are gems in the genre of Humor. As I read CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET on the train to work, fellow travelers must have looked at me strangely as I occasionally giggled.<br />This is light reading with a capital \\"L\\", but I heartily recommend it.AN YOU KEEP A SECRET on the train to work, fellow travelers must have looked at me strangely as I occasionally giggled.<br />This is light reading with a capital \\"L\\", but I heartily recommend it.	2004-04-14

Meanwhile, relegated to the periphery of British politics and virtually an outcast, Churchill obstinately lashes out against appeasement and loudly proclaims the necessity for total war to save democracy from the depredations of the Nazis. What subsequently follows is history: the German subjugation of the rest of Czechoslovakia and the invasion of Poland, the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, the Phony War, the Soviet invasion of Finland, the British military's Norwegian fiasco, and the crisis in His Majasty's government in May 1940 that ultimately elevated Winston to the premiership.<br />The cast of characters in this sweeping story by Michael Dobbs of political maneuvering, skullduggery, and backstabbing is an historical Who's Who of the times: the ailing, haughty, and pacifist Chamberlain, who personifies England's bitter memories of the Great War and the popular concept of &quot;never again&quot;; the ambitious and self-absorbed Churchill, whose pugnacity sometimes clouds prudence; the defeatist, philandering, and anti-Semitic U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James, Joseph P. Kennedy; the alcoholic, disillusioned and psychologically tortured idealist, Guy Burgess (of Burgess, Philby, and Maclean of Cold War infamy); the stuttering King George VI, who whines that the German invasion of Poland interrupted his grouse hunting; and the Machiavellian newspaper mogul, William &quot;Max&quot; Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook.<br />It's in the minor details with which Dobbs fleshes out the story of Chamberlain's fall and the rise of his nemesis, Churchill, to an epic 685 paper-backed pages (UK HarperCollins edition). And it's the length of WINSTON'S WAR that is, perhaps, a minor flaw. Some of the subplots seemed unnecessary, and should have been severely cropped by a ruthless editor: the love affair between the crippled WWI survivor &quot;Mac&quot; McFadden, barber to the politically great and one of Guy's information sources, and Carol, a housemaid and part-time prostitute; and between Bournemouth postmistress Sue Graham and Army Sergeant Jerry White - though the experiences of the latter did usefully tie the Norway debacle into the storyline on a personal level. Slightly more relevant, but still mildly tedious, was the dysfunctional relationship between Brendan Bracken, Churchill's closest confidant, and Kennedy's niece, Anna Fitzgerald. Perhaps Dobbs perceived a need to include Carol, Sue and Anna to make it less of a Guy Read.<br />Chamberlain was toppled not because he sought to appease Hitler and avert a cataclysm, but because he didn't have the mettle to wage all-out war when the necessity for it was thrust upon him. That was to prove to be Winston's genius. The author's genius is in portraying the labyrinthine venality of Whitehall and Fleet Street powerbroking at a time when solidarity against a rapacious common  enemy was desperately necessary.<br />WINSTON'S WAR is the first in a series of novels about Churchill's wartime leadership.

Then, of course, there was thread left dangling on the last page. Whose name, Morelli's or Ranger's, did Stephanie pull out of the bowl in her Night of Passion Lottery? In HOT SIX, it seems to me that Evanovich is indeed pushing it. And it turns out that Joe Morelli is the one that got lucky.<br />Plum is a bounty hunter in Trenton, NJ, employed by Vincent Plum Bail Bonds, the owner being her scummy cousin, Vinnie. Stephanie's modus operandi is either Keystone Cops or Bull-In-China-Shop, depending on her mood and the amount of junk snacks that she's consumed. The fact that she ultimately succeeds is based purely on dogged persistence and good fortune.<br />The skeleton of the HOT SIX plot is that Vinnie tasks Plum with apprehending Ranger, his best bond enforcement agent and Stephanie's friend and frequent mentor. Ranger has skipped bail on a ridiculous concealed weapon charge - everyone carries in Trenton - and it doesn't help that the local cops want to question him about the recent murder of a crime kingpin's son. Plum wants no part of it, least of all because she hasn't the skill to nab the ex-Special Forces soldier. But, as the bodies pile up, bagging Ranger becomes the least of her worries.<br />Don't get me wrong. HOT SIX is as funny as any previous book in the series. It's just that Janet's imagination has, in my opinion, finally gone over the top in populating the storyline with weird characters and dropping her heroine into bizarre situations. It's gotten to the point where less wackiness may be better. It's fine that her feisty Grandma Mazur, reminiscent of Sophia (Estelle Getty) of American TV's GOLDEN GIRLS sitcom, must move in with her, but not necessary that the former take driving lessons, date the ancient geezer upstairs, or purchase a red Corvette. It's not unusual that Stephanie apprehends a couple of oddball fugitives over the course of the book, but not required that one of them here be costumed as Captain Kirk at a Trekkies gathering during the takedown. And not surprisingly, Stephanie is followed by a couple of goons who also have an interest in finding Ranger. But does one of them really have to be a Pakistani emigre who, back in the old country, used to beat unruly children working in the village rug factory? What has before simply seemed to be Plum's bad karma is now too heavy a concentration of weird to be believed.<br />Finally, the reactions of Stephanie's mother to her antics - she say's &quot;Why me?&quot; and makes the sign of the cross a lot- are getting old. And Stephanie's long-suffering Dad continues to be a virtual cipher.  It's time both characters were fleshed out.<br />At least Stephanie is making progress in her love life. Is that a proposal of marriage coming from Morelli at the book's end? You think? After finishing this review, I'm off to purchase SEVEN UP.ephanie apprehends a couple of oddball fugitives over the course of the book, but not required that one of them here be costumed as Captain Kirk at a Trekkies gathering during the takedown.

In this book, Stephanie's official assignment takes back seat to a family request to find Uncle Fred, who's disappeared. But what's with the photos Uncle Mabel found in Fred's desk of a plastic garbage bag containing a dismembered body? Photography wasn't Fred's hobby.<br />In HIGH FIVE, Plum is beset with Briggs, Bunchy, Ramirez, Morelli, and Ranger. And that's just for starters. Briggs is a midget that becomes Plum's unwelcome houseguest after the latter's zeal for fugitive apprehension results in an unfortunate incident. The mysterious Bunchy also wants to find Fred, and is following Stephanie around. Ramirez, a psycho rapist that Plum helped put away in book one, is now back on the streets and wants revenge.<br />But the real core of the novel is Stephanie's lack of a sex life - a condition that's now reaching the critical stage. Plum has prurient yearnings for Joe Morelli, a distant relative and Trenton undercover cop - that is, when she's not hating his guts for being totally exasperating in the way males often are. After all, twelve years ago he did take her virginity behind the eclair counter of the pastry shop in which she was working. Then there's Ranger, the Cuban-American, bounty hunter extraordinaire who's Stephanie's sometime mentor and now, to her distraction, the occasional stud muffin of her fevered dreams. Our heroine has a yen for Bad Boys, and both Morelli and Ranger can be that, especially when they dress in black.<br />As one would expect in a continuing series, the author must ratchet up the wackiness of Stephanie's life a notch with each succeeding volume. Through the first five books, she's managed to do this without stretching my credulity beyond the breaking point. Plum is just one of those girls with excruciatingly bad karma. I'm beginning  to anticipate, though, a plot where Evanovich tries too hard. We'll see, because I intend to read all of the series - 5 more installments as of this review.<br />At the conclusion of HIGH FIVE, Stephanie succumbs to the need for a night of lovin', writes the names of Morelli and Ranger on separate pieces of paper, mixes them in a bowl, closes her eyes and picks one, summons the winner after showing his name to her pet hamster Rex, puts on a killer-sexy black dress, and waits for her man of the night to arrive. The reader won't know who got lucky until it's revealed in the prologue of HOT SIX. Rex and I know, but we're not telling.<br />If a Stephanie Plum book was to be made into a film, Sandra Bullock would be absolutely perfect in the title role.m is just one of those girls with excruciatingly bad karma.

In the next scene, General George Patton (George C. Scott) dramatically arrives at the headquarters of the II Corps to take command and turn things around for the Allies at the Battle of El Guettar. For those Americans whose only knowledge of the Western theater of WWII encompasses D-Day and its aftermath, and perhaps the battle for Italy, these cinematic images represent perhaps the total sum of acquaintance with the North African campaign. Yet, it's not until page 401 of AN ARMY AT DAWN that Patton takes over II Corps. There's so much more.<br />This book by Rick Atkinson is an extensively researched (29 pages of closely spaced sources) and engagingly written popular history of America's North African campaign in 1942-43. It begins, naturally, with the American and British amphibious landings of Operation Torch to capture Casablanca, Oran and Algiers, followed by the defeat of the Vichy French in Morocco and Algeria, and the bloody and stumbling but ultimately victorious confrontation with the Germans and Italians in Tunisia. AN ARMY AT DAWN is often not a pretty picture of Eisenhower's first outing as Supreme Commander or the U.S. Army's proficiency at large-scale land warfare, the latter not exercised since WWI. Indeed, as Rick Atkinson puts it, after defeating the fumbling French:<br />&quot;... as (the Americans) wheeled around to the east and pulled out their Michelin maps of Tunisia, they believed they had actually been to war.&quot; What a rude awakening the next few months were to be! But the Tunisian anvil forged the mettle of the WWII commanders that U.S. mythology now holds in high esteem: Eisenhower, Patton, Clark, and Bradley.<br />AN ARMY AT DAWN has thirty-two pages of photos, plus well-drawn and extremely helpful maps of the various major battles, generally described from the perspective of battalion, regiment and brigade.<br />Atkinson's book is inclusive of so much more than combat narrative. For example, the reader follows with interest the genesis of the Special Relationship now enjoyed by America and Britain, which luckily survived at its infancy the scorn between Anglophobes Bradley, Patton and Clark and contemptuous Brits such as Montgomery and Alexander. And squabbling occurred even further up the command ladder. After a lengthy description of the Casablanca Conference attended by Roosevelt and Churchill and the top war councils of each, the author describes the concluding press conference held in the lush garden of a borrowed villa at which Roosevelt smoothly announced:<br />&quot;The chiefs of staff have been in intimate touch. They have lived in the same hotel. Each man has become a definite personal friend of his opposite number on the other side.&quot; To which statement the author appends the tongue-in-cheek comment:<br />&quot;The chiefs stared impassively from their foliage redoubts.&quot;<br />AN ARMY AT DAWN is a must read for any casual student of WWII. This is billed as &quot;volume one of the liberation trilogy&quot;, and I look forward to the following two.<br />Oh, and as for Patton's depiction in the 1970 film, Atkinson's account confirms that George really did rush from his II Corps command post to fire his pearl-handled revolvers at strafing German aircraft.the perspective of battalion, regiment and brigade.  <br />Atkinson's book is inclusive of so much more than combat narrative.

The movie is loosely based - I stress loosely - on the book.<br />Author Patrick O'Brian quickly gets down to business. Within the first twenty-five pages, Lieutenant Jack Aubrey, RN, is assigned captaincy of the His Majesty's sloop &quot;Sophie&quot;, and he discovers a new friend in Dr. Stephen Maturin, a physician sans patients marooned in Minorca, whom Jack persuades to come aboard his vessel as its new medical officer. (At this point, it must be stressed that Stephen is a &quot;physician&quot;, not a &quot;surgeon&quot;, the latter profession held in low esteem as being not much better than that of a meat-cutter.) It's 1800, and England is embroiled in one of its interminable wars with France and Spain.<br />In the book as in the film, there are three themes. Ranked in importance, there is first the friendship between Aubrey and Maturin. Then, the depiction of Aubrey as a man and commander. And finally, the naval strategy, battles, and life aboard a wooden fighting ship.<br />Jack's an interesting character; in the book MASTER AND COMMANDER, he's still a diamond in the rough. He's brave, fair to his men, professionally ambitious, a competent sailor, lucky, and desirous of wealth. (Remember, in these times, the poorly paid crew and officers of a military man o' war could derive much, if not most, of their remuneration from the capture of &quot;prize ships&quot;, i.e. vessels flying an enemy's flag subsequently sold, with their cargoes, for profit by the Admiralty.) Most of all, Aubrey wants to advance up the pay-grade ladder into the admiral ranks. However, he tends to be insubordinate and, in MASTER AND COMMANDER at least, he's having an affair with his immediate superior's wife - the latter a potentially career-scuttling move.<br />For me, this volume isn't of the can't-put-down type. The naval combat action is first rate, during which time the story moves along at the clip of a fast frigate. Between battles, however, the pace may fall off to that of a slow barge, especially when Jack and Stephen are ashore. And, at all times, the nautical terms can make for rough sailing for landlubbers, as in the following when Maturin is given an explanation of &quot;lee shore&quot;:<br />&quot;... and (Mowett) explained the nature of leeway, the loss of windward distance in wearing, the impossibility of tacking in a very great wind, the inevitability of leeward drift in the case of being embayed, with a full gale blowing dead on short, and the impervious horror of this situation.&quot; Huh?<br />I shall acquire and read the next book in the series, POST CAPTAIN, but reserve the right to drop anchor and abandon ship anywhere in the 20-book series should the voyage become becalmed in the doldrums.time the story moves along at the clip of a fast frigate.

These depict &quot;some good (and bad) gestures&quot;, one of which, by a downward motion of a cupped hand, signals the question &quot;Did you get (sex)?&quot;<br />This book, more than lavishly illustrated with high quality color photos, is an enormously attractive travel guide to hedonistic Rio de Janeiro. It's larger sections are dedicated to the city's hotels, nightclubs and bars, street parties, music scene, food, and outdoor sports activities - all of which are geared to the under-30 crowd. If I were single, three decades younger, and off to Rio for my first bachanal, this small volume (148 pages) is one I'd have in my backpack.<br />Leafing through the pages, I was amused by the occasional contents, some of which are stated almost tongue-in-cheek. As examples:<br />In &quot;What to Bring&quot;, some items are cheap watch, cap, sun-screen, disposable camera, and anti-diarrhea medication. Perhaps imprudently, condoms aren't mentioned. (Perhaps my teenage daughter should carry her own when she goes?)<br />In &quot;9 Rio Commandments&quot;, one is cautioned: &quot;Most of Rio's slums are on the hills ... hillsides and mountains should be avoided like the plague.&quot; I guess skiing is out.<br />There are several pages of nicely done street maps showing hotels and hostels offering discounts, of course, but also locating the likes of internet cafes, cash machines, drug stores (for those condoms?), and, in case you get lucky with the opposite gender and need immediate relief, after-hours motels.<br />In &quot;Getting Around&quot;, when recommending against using buses: &quot;... crooks have been robbing buses,  and the mob sets one or two on fire when angry at the government.&quot; Hmm, and Californians only recalled Governor Gray Davis. Where's the passion in the Golden State?<br />In the itineraries of several day-tours, a common element is &quot;check email&quot;.

I guess the males of the species are expected to remain slovenly pigs.<br />Lastly, in the extensive and mouth-wateringly illustrated food section, there's the sub-section devoted to &quot;Street Foods and Snacks&quot;, which includes a hamburger and cheeseburger.

She's also a disaster magnet. So, when her latest assignment, Maxine Nowicki, who jumped bail after being charged with the theft of her estranged boyfriend's car, handcuffs Plum to the door of her own fridge, what's left to do while awaiting rescue but finish off the leftover banana cream pie, a jar of peanut butter, and a bag of baby carrots? And that's before her car explodes, her apartment is gutted by fire, and she gets raw egg in her hair.<br />As I work my way sequentially through the Stephanie Plum series, I stand amazed at the imagination of author Janet Evanovich that continually ups the ante on the absurdity of the situations in which Stephanie finds herself and the eccentricity of the characters that gravitate to our heroine like lint to a black dress. Yet, the craziness never seems pushed or over the top, but is just Stephanie's karma in a nutty world.<br />The continuing &quot;male lead&quot; in all of Plum's adventures is Joe Morelli, the rascally plain-clothes Trenton cop with whom Stephanie has a long love-hate relationship. When they were just pre-pubescent kids, the sexually precocious Joe lured Stephanie into his father's garage to play choo-choo. As teenagers, Plum ran down Morelli with the family Buick after Joe relieved Stephanie of her virginity on the floor behind the eclair counter in the pastry shop in which she worked. Yet, when Plum and her pet hamster Rex are left homeless after their apartment is torched in FOUR TO SCORE, it's the extra room in Joe's house into which Stephanie moves. Will she and Joe find True Love before they kill each other?<br />Like its predecessors in the series, this book is exceeded in trashiness perhaps only by a lurid bodice-ripper. But, should you pick up a Stephanie Plum adventure, I virtually guarantee you a good time.a good time.	2004-03-07

THE LAST GOODBYE is unusual in that my interest steadily waned as I turned the pages. By the end, I was pretty much indifferent to the hero and the outcome.<br />Jack Hammond is a disgraced Atlanta lawyer reduced to acting as public defender for the urban scum hauled into court on drug and petty theft charges. (Hammond, who's a closet romantic with a weakness for damsels in distress, was summarily dropped from the roster of a high-powered law firm two years before after sleeping with a client's girlfriend.) When Jack learns that Doug, a down-and-almost-out friend with a substance abuse problem, apparently overdosed on an injectable drug, he realizes that something is wrong with the picture. Doug had a paranoid fear of needles. Was it foul play? Hammond subsequently discovers that his old pal was a computer hacker extraordinaire, and that he had an obsession with the gorgeous Michele Sonnier, a troubled young woman from the Atlanta ghetto turned brilliant and wildly successful opera singer married to Charles Ralston, the philanthropic and much revered head of Horizn Pharmaceuticals. Once Horizn debuts in the plot, and considering activist hand-wringing over the greed of the evil drug companies, the reader suspects where the storyline is going - and so it does.<br />It's not that THE LAST GOODBYE is awful. Why, even as recently as yesterday, it provided welcome distraction during the boring bits of a professional seminar I had to attend.  But, for me, the characters never became real or garnered much sympathy. Hammond is supposed to be a lawyer, but he acts throughout like a private-eye wannabe; he never becomes sufficiently convincing as either. Minor characters that should have added zest to the story - Jack's Dumb Blonde secretary Blu and the antisocial computer outlaw Nightmare - don't really. Hammond's own preoccupation with the vulnerable Michele is torpid, and the affair slows the action down. Indeed, the final reckoning for the Bad Guys has all the knuckle-biting tension of a computer-enabled stock purchase. Worst of all for my overall opinion of the book, there are no twists clever and/or unsuspected enough to make me pause in admiration.<br />THE LAST GOODBYE is one of a multitude of similarly average potboilers that'll crowd the shelves of the brick-and-mortar booksellers, and which will ultimately end up on the discount tables of the clearance stores found in the outlet malls. Wait for its appearance at the latter and you'll only need to spend a couple bucks.slows the action down.

768623:US	53075086	RM9COX5YDLCVF	0743237978	508740396	An Englishman in Paris: L'Education Continentale	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Bachelor living in the City of Light	Expat Brit Peter Mayle has written several delightfully witty books (A YEAR IN PROVENCE, TOUJOURS PROVENCE, ENCORE PROVENCE) describing his long residence in Provence in an old farm house that he and his wife fixed up. Peter contributes the preface to AN ENGLISHMAN IN PARIS written by lunch-buddy and fellow countryman Michael Sadler.<br />According to the book's back flap, Sadler now lives in Paris and Touraine with his French wife and their daughter. There's no time frame to AN ENGLISHMAN IN PARIS, but I gather that it recalls Michael's experience as a younger and still-single man during his first extended trip to Paris from his home in England.<br />Sadler's narrative contains some decidedly humorous moments, as when he transports a large wheel of odiferous cheese from point A to B. Or when he makes his first tremulous journey through that chaotic maelstrom of traffic known as the Place de l'Etoile. And when he must transfer his belongings from temporary hotel lodgings to a new apartment, and there's nowhere to park in front of the latter. Or his culinary introduction to such delicacies as beef testicles and pigs ears. Then there's his giddy affair with a married French woman.<br />Compared to Peter's volumes, however, Sadler isn't quite so relaxed. Perhaps it's the abundant energy and hormones of a younger man. At times, Michael's activities seem positively frenetic. Moreover, he introduces into the text many French phrases and sentences, the translations of which aren't always readily apparent as you read them, if at all. To be fair, there is a 5-page glossary of terms and colloquial expressions at the end. Language aside, chapter 28 is entirely incoherent (by design, I assume) - as if he was writing under the influence of some cooking sauce made with hallucinogenic mushrooms.<br />AN ENGLISHMAN IN PARIS is short - only 193 pages in a small hardcover format. Reading the book doesn't require a large investment of time. But, if you want something more satisfying about life as a foreigner in France, go first with Mayle.bout life as a foreigner in France, go first with Mayle.	2004-02-26

The child is quickly put to rest in the cemetery of the Victory Baptist Church in the plot of Clara's maternal family line. But, there's a problem. For over two-hundred years, the congregation has been exclusively white. Nora is of mixed race, Elijah being Black and Clara Caucasian. Victory Baptist's thirteen deacon's subsequently vote, over the objections of the young pastor, the spiritually tortured Thomas Derby, to have the child exhumed and re-buried in the cemetery of the town's Baptist church for Blacks. The night after the exhumation, Victory Baptist is burned to the ground, and Elijah is arrested on-site for arson. Nat Deeds, a former county prosecutor who quit his job and fled Good Hope after his wife admitted to sleeping with another man, and who's now struggling to set up a private law practice in nearby Richmond, is pressured by the presiding judge to return to his birthplace and defend Elijah, who adamantly insists on his innocence. Deeds must now go up against his old boss, the posturing Ed Fentress, who's prosecuting for the commonwealth with the next election in mind. Nat hasn't a shred of a case, and it gets worse when the body of Amanda Talley, the teenage daughter of the county sheriff, is found in the burned rubble of the church. Amanda had apparently been raped, then burned in the fire.<br />I believed Elijah when he claimed to be innocent. Indeed, I immediately knew who did it. And, for a few pages near the end, it appeared I was right. Pretty darn smug I was, too. At that point, I would've extolled SCORCHED EARTH not as a mystery, but as story of three childhood acquaintances - Deeds, Derby, and Talley - grappling with personal demons. But a final plot twist at the end caught me completely broadside and made me feel the fool.

Perhaps he too realizes that fact, since &quot;biggest&quot; is the superlative form of the adjective. Poundstone has nowhere to go from here.<br />Unshelled peanuts aren't the most convenient bar snack, but it's hard to shell and eat only several. Likewise, BIGGEST SECRETS doesn't represent fine literature, but it's difficult to put down. Poundstone has several (favorite) recurring topics in his books:  the secret ingredients of famous junk foods, secret initiation rites, magicians' secrets revealed, reverse messages on popular music tracks, and subliminal pictures in movies. The last two seem almost obsessions. But, he also throws in others. For example, in BIGGEST, there are exposed: the formula for Play-Doh, security coding of lottery tickets, the meaning of gang graffiti, how to get that ship in a bottle, and celebs' real ages.<br />As with BIG, so many varied subjects are covered that the individual reader is certain to find some that intrigue, and some that bore to tears. So, I enjoyed learning about the Mrs. Field's chocolate chip cookie recipe, the method behind the rabbit-out-of-the-hat illusion, fake towns on maps, the ingredients of Spam and head cheese, Christmas gift return codes, the evolution of Kelloggs Frosted Flakes, and the location of Century House in London (MI-6 HQ). On the other hand, I couldn't care less about a stylometry evaluation of the Beale Cipher, a 19th-century treasure map in code, or the real ages of the likes of Joan Collins, the Gabor sisters, Don Rickles, Imogene Coca, Charo and Joan Rivers, or fire-lighting tricks of the Boy Scouts. Indeed, I skipped entirely the sections on hidden messages and pictures in music and films respectively. Thus, as with BIG, BIGGEST is an erratic entertainment vehicle. (I haven't read BIGGER SECRETS, nor do I intend to. Even unshelled peanuts lose their charm.)<br />Perhaps my favorite revelation was the means for creating a chocolate-covered cherry. Specifically, how do they get the liquid surrounding the fruit? Well, the manufacturer coats the cherry with a paste of sugar and the enzyme invertase, the latter a natural digestive enzyme, then dips it in chocolate. During storage, the invertase breaks down the sugar into a syrup. The author leaves us with a pleasing image:<br />&quot;It's almost as if the candy makers were thoughtful enough to spit in the candy to give you a head start on digestion.&quot;lled peanuts lose their charm.)<br />Perhaps my favorite revelation was the means for creating a chocolate-covered cherry.

Did you know that the seductive essence of KFC's secret blend of herbs and spices is nothing more than pepper and MSG? Yikes, no wonder I can chow down the 12-piece box in one sitting!<br />Author William Poundstone provides a wide variety of esoteric knowledge in BIG SECRETS - everything from an analysis of Coca Cola, an explanation of bar codes and the Rorschach (inkblot) Test, an interminable listing of &quot;secret&quot; radio frequencies, the truth about subliminal shots in movies and ostensibly secret messages in popular song tracks, and an answer to the question &quot;Is Walt Disney's corpse frozen?&quot;.<br />The range of topics in this book is wide, and for that I'd award five stars. However, though I'm reasonably intrigued by the arcane technology of printing currency, the magician's technique of sawing a woman in half, and whether or not there's two-year old fish in Worcestershire Sauce or a secret bank in Beverly Hills, I couldn't care less about the secret ingredients in high-end perfumes, the details of Freemason initiation rites, the method behind the Amazing Kreskin's feats of telepathy, or how playing cards are &quot;marked&quot;. And that's the book's biggest problem. While there's likely to be something of interest for everyone in its pages, not everything will be of interest to the individual reader. Therefore, since I read for entertainment, BIG SECRETS is, for me, only a three-star entertainment vehicle. Also, since the book was originally published in 1983,  twenty-one years ago - it's woefully outdated. I mean, nothing is mentioned about a secret email address for Bill Gates or what Martha Stewart does when she goes slumming.<br />According to Poundstone, 7-Up is the only major soft drink with no &quot;secret&quot; ingredients. Maybe that's why the beverage is so boring.	2004-02-15

HOME RUN is a masterpiece of his writing.<br />As the book begins, a young Iranian woman, Juliette Eshraq, is publicly hanged to death on a crane in downtown Tabriz by the revolutionary government that had previously overthrown the Shah and executed the girl's father and uncle. The plot then skips forward several years, and Juliette's younger brother, Charlie, who'd escaped to California with his American mother, is now of age and on a mission of vengeance in the Old Country to kill those who murdered the rest of his family. Charlie is secretly run by a senior executive of MI-6, Mattie Furniss, Head of the Iran Desk at Century House, friend of the Eshraq family from his time as Station Officer in Tehran during the Shah's rule, and Charlie's mentor. After carrying out three assassinations, Charlie must now return to Britain to get the expensive, advanced, weaponry needed to finish the job. As Charlie tells Mattie, money is no problem.<br />In the meantime, Lucy Barnes, teenage daughter of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Defense, dies of a heroin overdose in a squalid London flat. In his rage and grief, the Secretary prevails on his friend and government colleague, the Home Secretary, to flog the drug enforcement unit of Customs and Excise to exert maximum effort to find the pusher, distributor, and source. In the course of investigation, it's learned that the heroin is from Iran and brought into England by a man known only as Charlie Persia.<br />As the final piece in the plot's set-up, Furniss is ordered by MI-6's Director General to Iran's periphery to meet with his agents and improve the quality of information coming across. Mattie is code-named &quot;Dolphin&quot;. But, because of a leak in Britain's Bahrain Embassy, Iran's counter-intelligence unit knows Dolphin is coming, and plans accordingly.<br />A major component of HOME RUN is a conflict between two agencies of Her Majesty's government in which dedicated and well-meaning civil servants are ground up in the cogs of political maneuvering, and the ostensible &quot;bad guy&quot; squeezes through the crack. The battle on the home front makes almost irrelevant the machinations and brutality of Iranian counter-intelligence, though, by the end of the book, the reader is left to wonder which side administered the greater damage to our hero, the servants of the Mullahs or those of the Queen.<br />HOME RUN is the most complex and deliciously constructed of Seymour's many thrillers that I've read to date. Indeed, the reader is thrown a red herring at the beginning as to the identity of the storyline's chief protagonist. In any case, Seymour's forte is blurring the lines between the Good and the Evil; the former doesn't always win, nor does the latter always lose, to the satisfaction of Justice. The victory is usually pyrrhic. The plot resembles real life, and, in that regard, is eminently satisfying.<br />I'll soon run out of unread Seymour novels, and I shall be inconsolable./>A major component of HOME RUN is a conflict between two agencies of Her Majesty's government in which dedicated and well-meaning civil servants are ground up in the cogs of political maneuvering, and the ostensible &quot;bad guy&quot; squeezes through the crack.

Sorry, Bill. Stand aside for Pete McCarthy.<br />Author McCarthy was born in England of a Protestant English father and a Catholic Irish mother. This leads to a guilt-ridden, divided allegiance, especially when it's England vs. Ireland in football. However, in THE ROAD TO MCCARTHY, Pete's maternal side predominates as he takes us on an irreverent tour of Gibraltar, Tangiers, New York City, Tasmania, Montserrat, Montana and McCarthy, Alaska in search of far-flung evidence of Ireland and his clan's roots.<br />Why such disparate destinations you might ask? Well, Tangiers is home to the quasi-official chief of Clan McCarthy. And Gibraltar is just on the other side of the strait, so why not drop in? The Big Apple hosts the world's biggest St. Patrick's Day Parade. Tasmania, off Australia's southeast corner, was the brutal island prison to which Irish separatists were sent in the mid-nineteenth century, including one Thomas Francis Meagher, who subsequently escaped to become a Union general in the American Civil War and, briefly, Governor of Montana, the present day home of the head of the North American Clan McCarthy Association. The Caribbean island of Montserrat, the southern half of which is closed off because of active vulcanism, is the British colony to which destitute Irish men and women were once sent as slaves. And isolated McCarthy, AL (population 20) was named for a rugged copper miner who drowned in a local river in 1910.<br />Following the threads of Ireland and Clan McCarthy seems just an excuse as Pete regales the reader with observations about his immediate surroundings and the world in general. Like Bryson, his perspective filters through an offbeat sense of humor. But, while Bryson's is gentle and only slightly askew, McCarthy's is truly bent and with a sharper edge. For instance, when commenting on the current state of the British rail system:<br />&quot;Most stations aren't manned these days because it isn't cost-effective, so there's no one to collect the tickets, or the sick (i.e. vomit). Official policy is to rely on gradual dispersal by rook or magpie, unless they strike lucky and someone slips and mops it up with the back of their overcoat.&quot;<br />He can also be charmingly self-deprecating, as when advised in Alaska as to the proper response if meeting an aggressive black bear (fight back) or a grizzly (play dead).<br />&quot;... it would be foolish not to consider what you would do if confronted by one; but try as I may, I can't see myself coming up with much besides the weeping and the incontinence.&quot;<br />THE ROAD TO MCCARTHY is a compendium of laughs that I couldn't put down.<br />Finally, in all places except Alaska, Pete discovers that one can watch reruns of the American comedy &quot;Cheers&quot; on the telly. This is good to know should I ever wash up onto the doorstep of a seedy Tangiers hotel.ommenting on the current state of the British rail system:<br />&quot;Most stations aren't manned these days because it isn't cost-effective, so there's no one to collect the tickets, or the sick (i.e. vomit).

Sort of like Belgium. However, WHERE THE HELL ARE THE GUNS? testifies that the country's citizens are fully capable of daubing on the warpaint.<br />At the 1939 outbreak of WWII, author George Blackburn was a journalist. Seeking to enlist, he was turned down by the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force because of substandard vision. However, he sneaked into the army reserve on the basis of a sloppy eye exam administered by a reserve medical officer. Recommended for a commission, he went into officers' training in August 1941, and was subsequently assigned to the 4th Field Regiment of artillery already training in the United Kingdom. This book is the story of the 4th Field from it's formation at the war's outbreak to July 1944, when the unit shipped to France, and Blackburn's personal involvement from August '41. Two other books by the same author, THE GUNS OF NORMANDY and THE GUNS OF VICTORY, chronologically narrate his wartime adventures following the 4th Field's insertion into battle post D-Day.<br />Blackburn's style is unusual. When describing the experiences of others, he naturally uses the third person. However, when describing his own, he uses the second person - the only time I've ever come across such in an autobiography. So, the text has a semi-detached tone, as when George describes his reception at the 4th Field as a replacement subaltern of unproven worth:<br />&quot; ... you are an untried greenhorn whose opinion is not sought nor welcome when volunteered. You feel abandoned ... you burn with resentment ... Until you are accepted as a full-fledged member of the mess ..., you retire to your cot each night after dinner to write letters, read and put down diary notes...&quot;<br />Even the photo section containing twenty-three pictures includes not one of the author. Frankly, I found Blackburn's visual absence puzzling and his lack of first-person involvement in the narrative a bit stilted. Sort of like the Queen's use of the royal &quot;we&quot;. But don't let this distract you from the underlying excellence of the story.<br />If you're expecting a combat narrative, WHERE THE HELL ARE THE GUNS? isn't it. Except for a relatively brief aside about the August '42 Dieppe debacle, this volume is a revealing and sympathetic look at the life of an army unit training in the rear far from the front trenches. Indeed, George's outfit was resident in Britain preparing for the Big One from September 1940 to July 1944 - almost four years! Life for the 4th Field's troops was an endless round of training and rigorous field exercises cemented together by the morale-busting drudgery and monotony of camp life, and enlivened only by letters and parcels from home, visits to London or nearby pubs, and fraternization with the English citizens, e.g. dances with the local ladies and Christmas parties thrown for the local kids.<br />A student of World War II should find this volume a valuable look at a side of the conflict infrequently given print recognition. And who knew that the Canucks could be so feisty?it stilted. Sort of like the Queen's use of the royal &quot;we&quot;.

816909:US	53075086	RFTD7LJDFDBIV	039473825X	906665018	The Nature of Alexander	Books	4	87	92	N	N	Alexander revisited	Last October, I read and reviewed Peter Green's biography of Alexander the Great, ALEXANDER OF MACEDON, 356-323 B.C., to which I gave five stars. It was subsequently suggested to me that Green's book was a &quot;hatchet job&quot;, and that I should read Mary Renault's THE NATURE OF ALEXANDER for a more balanced view.<br />Renault's volume is very readable. In factual substance, it seems to my unscholarly eyes to be pretty much the same as Green's. I certainly didn't learn significantly more about Alexander from the former than the latter, though that portion of Renault's narrative concerning Alexander's death was fleshed out a bit more.  Renault, however, strikes me as a much more sympathetic biographer. Whether this adds more truth to her version is, and will remain, indeterminable by me.<br />In balance, I think I would choose and recommend Green's biography for the simple reason that he includes over a dozen route maps and battle plans that help the reader put Alexander's accomplishments in better perspective. Renault provides none at all, and the absence of such is a significant omission, in my opinion. Alexander led his Macedonians from the north of Greece to the western border of the Indian subcontinent - the edge of his known world - and almost all the way back again. Twenty-five thousand miles in eleven years! It isn't until you see this plotted on a map of the region that the remarkable accomplishment can be appreciated.<br />THE NATURE OF ALEXANDER reinforced my opinion that Alexander was the greatest military commander of all time and the most charismatic and successful leader of men who's ever lived. At one point, just prior to marching homeward from India, Alexander was gravely wounded by an arrow that penetrated his lung. The rumor spread through the army that he was dead, and he felt it necessary to show himself.  Renault quotes Nearchus:<br />&quot;... he ordered a horse to be fetched him. And when he mounted it ... the whole army clapped their hands repeatedly, and the banks and the river glades threw back the sound.

Cassidy is looking at 55 years of prison time, minimum, unless he plays ball with the company CEO, Nicholas Wyatt, who proposes a scheme to insert Adam as an espionage mole into the heart of Wyatt's biggest competitor, Trion Systems. There's evidence that Trion has initiated a super-secret project, and Cassidy's redemption is to find out what it's all about - or else.<br />To transform Adam into the marketable Whiz Kid that he isn't, he's intensively prepped by Nicholas Wyatt's personal &quot;executive coach&quot; and provided with a totally fictitious but very impressive CV. Launched into Trion for a job interview, he's subsequently hired. Through apparent luck and circumstance (and with info fed to him by his Wyatt handlers), Adam quickly becomes the special assistant to Trion's CEO, Jock Goddard. Cassidy is now in a perfect position to feed Wyatt intel on Trion's secret project, &quot;Aurora&quot;.<br />As befitting an espionage thriller, author Joseph Finder divides his book's ninety-three chapters into nine parts based on spy terminology, and which mirror the plot's evolution: The Fix (a person is blackmailed into being an agent), Backstopping (establishing an agent's cover), Plumbing (a covert operation's support assets), Compromise (detection by the opposition), Blown (exposure of an agent or operation), Dead Drop (hiding place for clandestine messages), Control (pressure exerted to prevent an agent's defection), Black Bag (illegal entry to obtain intelligence material), and Active Measures (operations that'll affect another nation's policies or strategies).<br />PARANOIA paints a cynical portrait of corporate business practices and ethics. Indeed, Cassidy is almost an anti-hero since he isn't exactly burdened with moral scruples. He regrets his original stunt only because he got nailed, and his role at Trion because the alternative is so much worse. That is, until he decides that Goddard is the most decent human being he's ever met - the loving father figure he never had. Is Adam developing a conscience?<br />Even at 400+ pages, PARANOIA is one of those books one wishes would never end. The action is taut, the dialogue clever, the plot darkly comedic, and the ending deliciously twisted (though perhaps not unexpected). My only complaint - a minor one - is that the last chapter, and indeed the very last line, is so lacking in closure for the Cassidy character that I looked to see if my copy was short a couple pages. (I intended to query the author, but hadn't saved his email address.) It only works if there's to be a sequel. But, looking at the author's publishing history, sequels don't seem to be his style.<br />I suggest PARANOIA would make an entertaining film starring Ben Affleck as Cassidy, Donald Sutherland as Goddard, and Tim Roth as Wyatt.ethics.

LEANING INTO THE WIND comes across as a stream of musings about the rest of her life, all given unity by their strong or loose association with Midwestern climatology.<br />Many of Susan's weather references are symbolic, as alluding to the &quot;storms&quot; that troubled the eleven years of her failed first marriage to Lawrence, or equating Life in general to the &quot;storm&quot; into which we all must step. Indeed, many of the author's insights come from the philosophical viewpoint of one in the autumn of life. Born in the early 40s, if Susan isn't already sixty, she closing on it fast. There are numerous sentences prefaced with &quot;I used to feel&quot;, &quot;over my lifetime&quot;, &quot;as I've grown older&quot;, &quot;when I was young&quot;, and &quot;these days&quot;.  For that reason, LEANING INTO THE WIND will perhaps not appeal to younger readers. One might have to be of &quot;that certain age&quot;, or a die-hard Toth fan.<br />Having lived in Southern California, where the climate is monotonously temperate 24/356, for fifty of my fifty-four years, I can't relate to Susan's description of weather's excesses. I've never personally seen a frozen lake, or had to take refuge in a storm cellar, or experienced eight inches of rain in as many hours. But the beauty of the author's prose is that I can immediately empathize when our experiences do intersect, as when she talks of leaping into an ice-cold pool from cement broiling under the July sun. Or, as sensitive to mosquito bites as she is, listening with dread to the drone of the summer pest in a dark room. Or reveling in the green, cool lushness of an English spring garden. Or smelling burning leaves in fall's nippy air. Toth brings it all back, no matter at what age I experienced the original. For the rest, of which I know nothing, I happily go along for the ride and trust in my guide.<br />LEANING INTO THE WIND is perhaps not the author's best book; its twelve chapters, though all under the Midwestern weather umbrella, are disparate from one another. And, at only 124 pages, it's overpriced in the hardback format. However, Toth has previously provided me with many hours of congenial reading, so I'll not be too begrudging. Love ya, Susan!. Toth brings it all back, no matter at what age I experienced the original.

834855:US	53075086	R2T1VMIOVCZTV1	1853268399	789454805	Ghost Stories (Wordsworth Classics)	Books	2	7	32	N	Y	Yawn	COLLECTED GHOST STORIES was first published in 1931. The thirty fictional &quot;ghost stories&quot; herein - more correctly, perhaps, stories of the supernatural - were written by author Montague Rhodes James at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. James was an English antiquarian, linguist, gentleman and scholar, so it's no surprise that each of the tales is usually about a fictional individual of similar capacities who's come across it while rummaging around in an old church, or among old books or letters, or has been told of it by a another who's had a direct experience with the paranormal. The plots take place in the 19th or late 18th century, and are mostly in a rural setting.<br />Compared to the writings of Stephen King and Dean Koontz, these yarns, while reasonably inventive, are decidedly not scary. Purists might assert these authors compose trash, while James's pieces comprise &quot;classic&quot; literature. Well, perhaps, but COLLECTED GHOST STORIES still put me to sleep in short order as I read them in bed at night.<br />The author's style includes the penning of interminable paragraphs that numbingly extend for one or two pages. And he sometimes includes Latin phrases or sentences that go untranslated. I guess genteel readers in those days were more robustly educated, or the author didn't expect the narrative to fall before such plebeian eyes as mine. (True, I took two years of the language in high school, but it evidently didn't stick.)<br />At times, the plot of an individual story seems overly contrived, as the one about the phantom conjured up by the unusual pattern in a new set of curtains. Worse, James occasionally and intentionally leaves out an element of the story that might have otherwise improved upon it, as the tale of a country doctor who falls victim to the evil machinations of a fellow physician:<br />&quot;Annexed to the other papers is one which I was at first inclined to suppose had made its way among them by mistake. Upon further consideration I think I can divine a reason for its presence. ... It relates to the rifling of a mausoleum in Middlesex ... The account is blunt and terrible. I shall not quote it.&quot; Then why, pray tell, bring it up?<br />My favorite chapter was &quot;A View from A Hill&quot;, which has as its chief prop an old and singular pair of binoculars filled with some sort of icky distillate, and which allowed one to see through the lenses landscapes and buildings from the past. My kind of high-tech gadget! (Sort of like the x-ray glasses I saw advertised as a kid becoming interested in girls, and which I thought would allow me to see through ... well, you know.)<br />I started this review with the intent of awarding three stars, but have worked myself up into a froth of dissatisfaction with the volume as a whole. So, two stars. The author's long dead anyway and not likely to care.take. Upon further consideration I think I can divine a reason for its presence. ...

Anyone reading Asbury's narrative might be led to believe that good folks were a miniscule minority.<br />THE FRENCH QUARTER suffers from being published almost seventy years ago. Aside from a number of old sketch reproductions, and several badly reproduced B&amp;W photographs of bordello interiors and exteriors during the Storyville era, THE FRENCH QUARTER is sadly lacking in illustration. There's not even a map of the city from which to get one's bearings.<br />This work is wonderfully informative as far as it goes, perhaps  occasionally more so than is needed to make the point that the city, especially in the mid-1800s, could be a noxious place. The narrative is sober and straightforward, only occasionally displaying dry humor. A couple examples from the text will suffice to give one a sense of the book's tone and the city's iniquity.<br />Regarding barrel-houses,the lowest form of drinking place: &quot;The owner of one such establishment not only doped all of his liquor, but maintained his own staff of sneak thieves ... (who) worked on a percentage basis and took turns robbing the sodden wretches who were dragged from the barrel-house.&quot;<br />Regarding the streetwalkers of the Dauphine and Burgundy Street vice area after the Civil War:<br />&quot; ... the perambulating bawds flung a piece of old carpet on the sidewalk and entertained their customers in full view of passers-by and the prostitutes in the houses ... (who) kept pails of hot water handy to discourage use of the doorsteps.&quot; Hmm, I would have thought ice water more effective at shrinking amorous ardor.<br />Decades after THE FRENCH QUARTER appeared, N'awlins is a model of purity.

While mildly entertaining, you wouldn't be tempted to stay up and finish it in one sitting and thus lose sleep.<br />Physician Jean-Baptiste Poncet lives with his wife Alix in Isfahan, the capital of the decaying Persian Empire, in the first quarter of the 18th century. Francoise, a former servant in the employ of Alix when Poncet and Alix were but unmarried lovers in Cairo, appears after a separation of fifteen years. She reports that her husband, Juremi, a good friend of Jean-Baptiste's, was captured by Tzar Peter the Great's troops while serving in the Swedish army, and was exiled with other captured prisoners to an area north of the Caspian Sea. Loyalty, and a desire for adventure, sends Poncet and his adopted son, George, off to Russia to rescue his old friend. During Jean-Baptiste's absence, a ragtag Afghan army lays siege to Isfahan, causing hardship for Alix, the Poncet's daughter Saba, and Francoise.<br />Author Jean-Christophe Rufin's story is imaginative enough. However, he never puts any of the principals into such genuine peril that the reader fears for their lives. There's no real drama or edge-of-your-seat tension as the plot unrolls. Indeed, the manner in which Jean-Baptiste and Alix are reunited has the elements of a farce.<br />One of the most interesting minor roles is that of Bibichev, a member of the Russian secret police who's attached to Poncet's party as it travels into southern Russia and beyond. Bibichev's imagination and paranoia ascribe all sorts of conspiratorial motives to the most ordinary of Poncet's actions, and the agent's reports back to Moscow HQ make for amusing reading. Unfortunately, Bibichev's role in the meandering storyline becomes less visible as it progresses until, at the end, he's barely in evidence. It's too bad because Bibichev was, in his own sinister way, one of the book's more engaging characters.<br />THE SIEGE OF ISFAHAN was good enough to finish, but I rushed through the last sixty or so pages just so I could be done with it and move on to something better. This in itself became a chore as the sappy ending seemed to go on forever.

884686:US	53075086	RQ33SGV8W9L5I	0385336667	530810768	Persuader (Jack Reacher, No. 7)	Books	5	88	93	N	N	Jack gets his teeth loosened	PERSUADER, the seventh installment of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, is perhaps the best so far.<br />On a Boston sidewalk, Reacher almost collides with a man shot three times - including twice in the head - and pitched off a cliff into the Pacific ten years before. Having a former colleague in the Military Police put a trace on the man's license plate brings the Drug Enforcement Agency to Jack's door. And what might your interest be, sir? Reacher, is it?<br />Jack, a former Army MP major that now wanders the United States as a near-vagrant always on the lookout for wrongs to rectify, finds himself aiding the Feds as he goes undercover to penetrate a fortified mansion on an isolated headland on Maine's wild coast. The DEA suspects that the mansion's owner, Zachary Beck, is using his importing business to bring in something other than Oriental floor coverings. And Beck apparently has a connection to Reacher's sidewalk ghost. Jack doesn't care about Beck or his rugs, but does have another old score to settle once and for all. And this time he going to get it right, or die trying.<br />The plot of PERSUADER includes the first time I can recall Jack feeling fear. Well, not fear maybe, but at least apprehension. Beck's gatekeeper, Paulie, is six inches taller, ten inches wider across the shoulders, and two hundred pounds heavier than our hero. Paulie's arms are bigger than Jack's legs. And he's surprisingly quick. Both you and Reacher know that, at some point, he's going to have to fight this monster. From Jack's point of view, that's going to be the dodgy bit. The reader savors the expectation.<br />Jack's my favorite Loner and Tough Guy in the Trashy Literature genre. But, his habitual physical impregnability becomes almost monotonous. So, the fact that Reacher's life comes within a gossamer thread of being extinguished more than once in this thriller is refreshing. Now that his vulnerability has been established, I look forward more than ever to Child's next volume.<br />Part of Jack's allure is that there's a hint of dysfunctionality to his personality. In PERSUADER, the reader learns that during Reacher's time in the service as an Army officer, he owned no civilian clothes. In an earlier book, it's revealed that Jack doesn't even know how to iron a shirt. Child's hero has some serious issues, which I hope someday the author will explore.<br />Part of Jack's allure is that there's a hint of dysfunctionality to his personality.

In THE FUTURE OF WAR, Marc Cerasini shares with us the neat gadgets with which the U.S. military can kick butt in the 21st century. Hooo-rah!<br />Part 1 of the book makes the point that the high tech weaponry used in the 1991 Gulf War is but an introduction to better things to come. I should hope so. (The First) Gulf War is by now ancient history. Who have we thrashed lately? (And where ARE those Iraqi WMD, anyway?)<br />Parts 2 and 3 describe the upcoming clever goodies to outfit, arm and carry our men and women into battle on the ground and the sea. Such things as exoskeleton suits, robots, stealth ships, nifty tanks and helicopters, flying amphibious assault boats, electrothermal and electromagnetic rail guns, precision guided arty shells, and color-changing battle uniforms. Special sections address the future of special ops forces and the Marines. Nuclear subs, by the way, are pretty much at a dead end.<br />It isn't until Part 4 that Cerasini gets to the really cool stuff, i.e. hardware for combat in the air and space. (After all, that's why we civilians lap up films like TOP GUN and STAR WARS.) Interestingly enough, however, the author maintains that conventional, manned warplanes are on the endangered species list. Unmanned drones will be able to do the job more effectively, especially at levels of maneuverability that would kill a human pilot. (Say it ain't so, Tom!)<br />THE FUTURE OF WAR is also a Who's Who of defense contractors: Martin-Marietta, Boeing, General Electric, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Honeywell, Raytheon, and McDonnell Douglas. As a matter of fact, much of the book's text has that measured enthusiasm of a corporate marketing piece created, say, for levering more money out of Congress. Indeed, Cerasini rarely mentions anything so gauche as cost to the taxpayer, prototype failures, or - heaven forbid! - cost overruns. (In all fairness, the author does say about the Osprey helicopter - the subject of a damning &quot;60 Minutes&quot; expose - that &quot;the program to develop the Osprey has been troubled.&quot;) As the author would have the reader infer, the business of cutting edge weapons development is pretty much an on-time, within-budget, rosy place. Puhleeze!<br />Don't expect much in the way of photographic illustrations. There are only five, and they're virtually worthless.<br />The last chapter, &quot;When, Where, and How to Deploy?&quot;, is Cerasini's opinionated discourse on the subject in which his political leanings show. It's not that I disagree with most of what he says, but I just don't care to be preached at, and I think perhaps that the inclusion of this rant in an otherwise factually stated (as far as it goes) and interesting book was unwise.<br />I started this review intending to award 4 stars, but I've just talked myself down to 3.

The fact that they weren't results in more pages for the buck, but also perhaps a less satisfying storyline.<br />On one track, we have a 10-year old boy, whose family has been slaughtered, fleeing cross-country from the killers. He comes upon the isolated Hammond farm in the wee hours inhabited by its sleeping residents. Within no time, the killers track the boy to the home and butcher the family. The boy continues his flight, taking along the Hammond's pet dog and the identity of the Hammond son, Curtis. Eventually, &quot;Curtis&quot; teams up with identical twins Cass and Polly - statuesque, street smart, pistol-packin', blond, ex-Las Vegas showgirls roaming the West chasing UFO sightings in a motorhome purchased with divorce settlement monies.<br />There's something strange about Curtis. His knowledge of the world is solely based on 9,658 viewed movies.<br />On a parallel track, we have 9-year old Leilani, born physically deformed like her older brother Lukipela because of their mother Sinsemilla's incessant and heavy drug use. Both Leilani and her mother are under the control of the former's stepfather, Preston Maddoc. The family travels around the country in a converted bus to sites of potential extraterrestrial landfalls. Preston claims that the ETs can heal Leilani's deformities. The girl knows better. The way she tells it, Preston, aka Dr. Doom, is a serial killer, who murdered her brother in the Montana woods on his tenth birthday. Leilani fears she's next.<br />Leilani befriends Micky Bellsong, a jobless, ex-con at rock bottom, who lives with her Aunt Gen in the Los Angeles area. After hearing Leilani's story, Micky decides to redeem her life by rescuing the girl from Preston and Sinsemella, but the three depart before she can act. To help track down and recover the girl, Micky employs private detective Noah Farrel, who's burdened with guilt for having let his father beat his sister into a permanent coma seventeen years before.<br />Have I lost you in the melodrama yet? In any case, all players eventually collide in Idaho at the dilapidated home of a pathetic recluse that gives new meaning to the term &quot;pack rat&quot;.<br />This thriller is no better than a beach read, though it may take several days while soaking up the carcinogenic UV rays. That the book would have been better split into two is evidenced by the awkward last chapter, which made me think that the author, having arrived at his publisher's deadline, mused, &quot;Uh-oh, now what do I do to wrap this up?&quot;<br />The conclusion pretty much brings to closure the Leilani arm of the story, but leaves so much unclarified about Curtis's situation and future that I smell a sequel coming. That's fine, as long as it includes Polly and Cass.<br />ONE DOOR AWAY FROM HEAVEN better serves, perhaps, as an outlet for the author's loathing for utilitarian bioethics, that philosophy which condones (and, at its extreme, promotes) the elimination of those members of society deemed unproductive, i.e. those who are aged, deformed, insane, terminally ill, or just dirt poor.<br />The author also reveals his predilection for dogs.

He's transported us to such widely separated locales as Britain, Australia, Africa, and the Appalachian Mountains. And his laid back, humorous style is always a pleasure to read.<br />In A SHORT HISTORY OF NEARLY EVERYTHING, Bill expands his horizons to ... well, nearly everything, from the Universe to the atoms that make it up. In between, he chats about the potential for catastrophic volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes, Einstein's theories, cellular biology, the evolution of life on Earth and Man in particular, the Periodic Table of the Elements, glaciation, quantum mechanics, the currents and depths of the world's oceans, continental drift, subatomic particles, the Big Bang Theory, the Earth's layers and core, the development of Chemistry and Geology, the fossil record, the atmosphere, mass extinctions, DNA, and so much more.<br />In the Introduction, Bryson admits that he didn't know much about the planet he lives on. So, he spent three years researching and interviewing so he could tell us all about it. What has resulted is a thoroughly enjoyable work of popular science that provides food for thought and imagination. And the stuff that party trivia questions are made of. Did you know that perhaps 10% of a 6-year old pillow's weight is made up of &quot;sloughed skin, living mites, dead mites, and mite dung&quot;? Or that there are six feet of DNA squeezed into every cell of your body - about twenty million kilometers worth? Or that the Human Genome Project suggests that there are about 35,000 to 40,000 human genes - roughly the same number found in grass? Or that the element Francium is so rare that there may only be twenty atoms of it on the entire Earth at any one time? Or that Madame Curie's notebooks are still so radioactive that they're stored in a lead box?<br />What I find amazing is that the author managed to learn so much about a whole lot in so short a time. I mean, he includes thirty-eight pages of Notes and a ten-page Bibliography. I'm reminded of the high school term papers I struggled through, albeit less grandiose in scope and accomplishment.<br />Bill, you get an A+ on this one.

If a romantic and treasured perception of Western banditry stems from having seen the 1969 film BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, perhaps you'd better not read IN SEARCH OF BUTCH CASSIDY, first published in 1977.<br />Author Larry Pointer's working hypothesis is that Butch Cassidy didn't die in 1908 amidst a hail of Bolivian gunfire. Rather, he returned to the United States and lived in Spokane, WA, as William T. Phillips before dying of cancer in 1937. Pointer spent 5 years building the case, and his arguments are compelling. Indeed, the basis around which the author constructs this story of Cassidy's life is William's unsold manuscript &quot;The Bandit Invincible&quot;, an unsuccessful commercial attempt by Phillips to capitalize on his adventures. Pointer quotes lengthy passages from the document, and used it as the starting point for his own research of events after determining to his satisfaction, through handwriting analysis and eyewitness testimony, that Cassidy and Phillips were indeed the same person - a process completed by the end of chapter 3.<br />IN SEARCH OF BUTCH CASSIDY is a competently told, if somewhat dry, biographical narrative by a writer obsessed with his subject. The amount of detail provided is a tribute to Pointer's investigatory  labors. Though not really the author's fault, the near-confusion surrounding the names of places and individuals almost compelled me to make out a score card for reference. In his manuscript, Phillips admits to changing some names of people and places. This, plus the outlaws' penchant for using aliases and inaccurate reporting by contemporary newspapers, makes the going occasionally tricky despite  Pointer's best effort to keep identities straight.<br />The volume is nicely sprinkled with B&amp;W photographs of the many individuals mentioned in the text. However, Pointer got too cute with three images of very extensive sections of terrain taken from space upon which he indicates the location's of Cassidy's hideouts. While first thinking these were clever additions to the whole, I then decided that they were virtually worthless as purveyors of useful information. A suitably annotated, modern highway map would have perhaps served better, or even the same photos with the critical areas enlarged much more.<br />For me, the book's best single feature was an extensive quote from outlaw Matt Warner's memoirs on the rigors of being pursued by a posse. This included:<br />&quot;... if one of us got sick, or nearly died with rheumatism or toothache, or got a leg broke; he had to grit his teeth and trail right along ... If he died he died just like a horse or dog along the trail ... and his body would be eaten by the coyotes.&quot;<br />Yup, I think I'll saddle up Old Hoss and go hold-up a train.deouts.

In THE JOURNEYMAN TAILOR, we're off to one of the most intractable of Gordian knots, Northern Ireland.<br />Jon Jo Donnelly, a legend in his own time, is an IRA assassin on undercover assignment in the heart of England with his sniper rifle and cache of explosives. Back in Donnelly's Ulster home town, Song Bird is a British Security Service (MI5) informant embedded in the IRA infrastructure. Gary &quot;Bren&quot; Brennard, a newbie to MI5, is rushed over in short order to Northern Ireland to help run Song Bird after his predecessor's cover is blown.<br />Jon Jo is killing at will in Britain's hinterland. The PM wants his head on a platter yesterday. MI5's plan is to lure Donnelly back to his farm and family, at which time he can be isolated by Song Bird for elimination by Her Majesty's forces.<br />The focus of this thriller isn't Jon Jo, Song Bird or Bren. Rather, it's young Cathy Parker, ruefully characterized as &quot;a slip of a thing&quot; by the Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, whose ears have been burned by Parker's no-compromise lecture on Song Bird's importance. Cathy is Bren's boss on the ground and the informer's recruiter and chief handler.<br />In Seymour's other novels that I've read, the primary protagonist's motives are revealed. In Parker's case, we learn little of her background other than she's the renegade daughter of affluent English parents. In the now, she's red-haired, 5 foot 4 inches tall, weighs 8 stone 3 pounds, obsessively driven by her job, idolized by her male peers, backed to the max by her superiors, and affectionately regarded by MI5's otherwise bitter rivals in the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Special Air Services. An alpha female that draws males like moths to light. Will Bren's wings get singed?<br />Since Seymour doesn't repeat a main character in other novels, it's unlikely we're to meet Cathy again. A pity, since, to me at least, she's proved to be one of the author's most engaging creations. Parker aside, however, this riveting book continue's the author's tradition of giving the reader a (presumably) realistic insight into the minds and hearts of the ordinary people who fight the gritty conflicts in the grotty corners of the civilized world where there are no winners and losers - only survivors. This is good stuff - the best of the genre on pulp fiction shelves.doesn't repeat a main character in other novels, it's unlikely we're to meet Cathy again.

DISTANT MIRROR by Barbara Tuchman, MEN TO MATCH MY MOUNTAINS by Irving Stone, and Shelby Foote's monumental Civil War trilogy come to mind. ALEXANDER OF MACEDON, 356-323 B.C. by Peter Green is now another.<br />This material first appeared as ALEXANDER THE GREAT in 1970. This particular volume, a revision and expansion of that earlier book, is the second reprint (1991) of the title first published in 1974.<br />For the sake of background, the author necessarily begins his masterpiece with Alexander's father, Philip of Macedon, whose achievement was to unify Macedonia and coerce the Greek states to the south to join with him in an Hellenic League. But, after Philip is assassinated on page 105, it's all Alexander as he marches his army on a peripatetic route of conquest against the Persian Empire throughout Asia Minor and the Middle East as far as present-day West Pakistan - and then back again. Twenty-five thousand miles - the circumference of the Earth - in eleven years. I kept turning the pages to see what he was going to do next.<br />In his &quot;Preface to the 1991 Reprint&quot;, Green makes it clear that his study of Alexander is a work in progress, and that even this book needs further revision in the light of new information. However, as flawed as the author may consider his ALEXANDER OF MACEDON  to be, his masterful distillation of 17 pages worth of ancient and modern sources makes the narrative of Alexander's life sing. Green's prose is crisp and touched with a dry humor, and it never bogs down.<br />Though Green concludes that Alexander is &quot;perhaps ... the most incomparable general the world has ever seen&quot;, he doesn't spare his subject from charges of megalomania and tyranny. But, in a man who never lost a battle and was proclaimed first the son of a god, and then himself a deity, can this be so surprising? Alexander is, in a sense, a tragic figure - one who couldn't see the wisdom in the statement of his subordinate commander, Coenus:<br />&quot;Sir, if there is one thing above all others a successful man should know, it is when to stop.&quot;<br />ALEXANDER OF MACEDON is replete with a Table of Dates, fourteen maps and battle plans, and a 24-page appendix examining in detail the poorly documented battle on the River Granicus, Alexander's first victory in Asia against the Persian king Darius III.<br />My only complaint regarding this riveting historical piece is that the author didn't summarize the chaotic dissolution that overtook Alexander's empire immediately after his death. The contrast would have made me appreciate Alexander's achievement all that much more.- one who couldn't see the wisdom in the statement of his subordinate commander, Coenus:<br />&quot;Sir, if there is one thing above all others a successful man should know, it is when to stop.&quot;<br />ALEXANDER OF MACEDON is replete with a Table of Dates, fourteen maps and battle plans, and a 24-page appendix examining in detail the poorly documented battle on the River Granicus, Alexander's first victory in Asia against the Persian king Darius III. <br />My only complaint regarding this riveting historical piece is that the author didn't summarize the chaotic dissolution that overtook Alexander's empire immediately after his death.

Should Hollywood make any of the books into a film, the lead role is made for Sandra Bullock.<br />In TWO FOR THE DOUGH, novice bounty hunter Stephanie is on the hunt for Kenny Mancuso, who's jumped bail after being charged with shooting a service station attendant in the knee. As the plot unfolds, Plum becomes involved in the investigation of a weapons theft from an Army arsenal, and is mailed various body parts carved from corpses on slabs at a local mortuary. All to the continuing discomfiture of her family, who just wants her to find a nice man and get married. Or at least a job that pays steady.<br />Admittedly, the plots of the Plum novels are rudimentary. Almost amateurish even. But they serve as the skeleton structures upon which Evanovich constructs the superbly hilarious misadventures of her klutzy heroine. Not since Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series with Becky Bloomwood have I been so amused.<br />A major attraction of the series is the cast of ongoing, supporting characters. Foremost is Joe Morelli, a plain-clothes cop on the Trenton (NJ) PD, and Plum's reluctant ally in her pursuit of the bad guys. Joe and Stephanie would be lovers except that she finds him so infuriating, and the fact that she manages to trash Joe's cars. Another is her maternal grandmother, Grandma Mazur, a feisty old lady who see's herself as Clint Eastwood and her granddaughter's sometimes partner. In that hypothetical film of Stephanie's exploits, Mazur would be played by Dorothy's Mom in TV's GOLDEN GIRLS, Sophia.<br />The first book in the series having established what is apparently a pattern, I expect Stephanie to experience continuing car problems and ridiculous predicaments. In this second volume, Plum's Jeep is stolen, and she inherits the use of a powder blue, 1953 Buick in mint condition - a veritable tank with which she proceeds to wreak destruction on cars around her. And whereas in the first installment she's handcuffed naked to her own shower curtain rod by her quarry, in TWO FOR THE DOUGH she collapses a rickety fire escape, plunging butt-first into a pile of dog poop. According to the helpful Joe, a very large and sick dog.<br />Stephanie has a pet hamster named Rex, stores her .38 in a cookie jar, and, during extended surveillances, takes pottie breaks at M&amp;D's. She obsesses about her weight, but Kit-Kat bars are de rigueur munchies for stakeout duty. During stressful moments, her mind can wander to consideration of a sexy pair of purple pumps, and the necessary additions to her wardrobe that such would require. How can you not love this woman?

An ace auto mechanic and owner of a struggling limo business, Munch is moving into a new house with her adopted daughter, Asia, when an old friend in need shows up.<br />Ellen Summers was Mancini's best gal-pal in the rough old days, and is just released from her latest stint in the California Institution for Women, a penal facility. Summers is being sought by vicious killers who want returned a very large sum of counterfeit Franklins that she found and hid before her most recent imprisonment. The first bodies in a growing pile are those of Ellen's Mom and stepfather. Meanwhile, Munch is being harassed by the jealous ex of a poor choice of lovers, and she doesn't need the heavy baggage that Ellen has brought to her and Asia's doorstep.<br />By design or not, assigning Ellen a major role in this fifth book of the Munch Mancini series was true inspiration by author Barbara Seranella. Summers is at least a pale reflection of Seranella's protagonist before she became a contributing member of society. For those steady readers of the series, who perhaps thought that Munch was becoming too middle-class, or for those being introduced to Munch for the first time, Ellen is a much-needed reminder of Mancini's former low-life edginess. That aspect, plus the ending plot twist of NO MAN STANDING, extends my interest in the series as a whole, the storylines of which will need to be unpredictable to keep me returning for more. While the last chapter gives a too obvious hint to the evolution of Mancini's love life in the next book, I trust the author will surprise us.<br />The back flap of NO MAN STANDING reveals that Barbara Seranella ran away at fourteen from the showcase upper middle-class enclave of Pacific Palisades, CA, joined a San Francisco hippie commune, rode with outlaw bikers, and became an auto mechanic. Since I also spent several idyllic childhood years in Pacific Palisades before my uneventful and unrebellious teens, I wish we could sit and compare notes to determine where I went wrong.so spent several idyllic childhood years in Pacific Palisades before my uneventful and unrebellious teens, I wish we could sit and compare notes to determine where I went wrong.	2003-09-19

The populist approach by author Simon Winchester reminds me of Carl Sagan.<br />It isn't until page 233 of this 390-page hardback that the narrative arrives at 10:02 AM on August 27, 1883, when the volcanic island of Krakatoa, situated in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra, blew up. The explosion was heard 2,968 miles away - roughly the distance between Philadelphia and San Francisco, ejected enough dust into the upper atmosphere to color sunsets worldwide for the next three years, and generated waves strong enough to register on tide gauges on England's south coast. Of the Earth's volcanic blasts known to history, this was the fifth largest.<br />In the preceding 232 pages, Winchester skims a fascinating array of relevant subjects that should appeal to any reader of eclectic interests: the evolution of the Dutch East India Company and its spice trade, Darwinism, the Wallace Line, continental drift, convection currents inside the Earth's mantle, plate tectonics, paleomagnetism, subduction zones, the development of underwater telegraph cables, evidence for Krakatoan eruptions in earlier centuries, and the observed paroxysms of the doomed island in the months, days, and hours before the final cataclysm. While many of the subjects may sound dry, the author's treatment of them isn't.<br />10:02 AM on August 27 went by in an instant. The pages following describe the series of ocean waves, the last over 100 feet high by the time it hit nearby coasts, that killed all but 1,000 of the 36,000+ who died in the calamity. After the waters subside and the ashes settle, Winchester closes with a discussion of the art inspired by years of glorious, dust-mediated, sunsets. And the re-emergence of a new volcanic island, Anak Krakatoa, on the site of the old, including the establishment of plant, insect and animal life on its barren, steaming surface.<br />The author bases his story on a multitude of scientific and historical sources, many of which involve eyewitness accounts of events. These, plus Winchester's dry humor, make for an engaging read. There's one chapter, however, which the book's editor should've advised tossing, i.e. the one unconvincingly postulating that the 1883 disaster sparked the revolt of the Islamic native population against their Christian Dutch overlords, which resulted in the latter being sent packing from Indonesia in 1949. Hmm. Perhaps it was just because the Dutch colonial administration wasn't warm and cuddly. You think? Also, though the volume is interspersed with useful photos and drawings, Winchester's own visit to Ana Krakatoa is visually unrepresented - a sorry lapse.<br />Ana Krakatoa translates as &quot;Son of Krakatoa&quot;. The history of the island suggests it may also mean, &quot;I'm back, and you'll be sorry!&quot; Surfers at some future time may have another opportunity to catch a Monster Wave.entific and historical sources, many of which involve eyewitness accounts of events.

My appreciation of John le Carre having increased over the years, I recently gave it another go.<br />The book is set in the then West German capital of Bonn during the heyday of the Cold War. The British Embassy is beset with a number of mysterious disappearances: a document trolley, a tea machine, an electric fan, and some cups from the Caf. Oh, and a twenty-plus year employee named Otto Harting and a Top Secret &quot;Green File&quot;. Meanwhile, on the other side of the embassy fence, a West German industrialist, Karfeld, is inflaming the populace with nationalist speeches, advocating stronger ties with Moscow, and undermining Bundesrepublik support for Britain's entry into the Common Market.<br />Has Harting bolted to Moscow? The Foreign Office in London dispatches its troubleshooter, Alan Turner, to Bonn to ferret out some answers.<br />Like le Carre's other books, A SMALL TOWN IN GERMANY is short on action and long on character and plot development. For these very reasons, my appreciation of his later books, especially TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY and SMILEY'S PEOPLE, both featuring the author's most famous hero, George Smiley, lead me to think that my literary tastes have matured over the years, at least when it comes to trashy novels. If the reader of this book squints, he may perhaps see in Turner's dogged pursuit of the puzzle pieces a forerunner of the Smiley character, though the latter is infinitely more subtle and imperturbable. And Turner is not above slapping a lady in his quest for the Truth. Such conduct would be anathema to George, always the gentleman.<br />That Turner never endears himself to the reader is perhaps the novel's greatest shortcoming. More than that, however, is the fact that the plot is dated. Germany is now re-united, and the capital moved back to Berlin. Bonn is once more a relative backwater. Powerful Germans with an unsavory Nazi past are practically extinct. Moscow is no longer homebase to the pesky KGB and center of the Evil Empire. But the Brits, God love 'em, having told the rest of Europe to take their euros and stuff it, are still stolidly aloof in their island fortress (despite the Chunnel).<br />A SMALL TOWN IN GERMANY, a must read for all le Carre fans, isn't one of his best efforts when compared to later works.

In modern times, the Failed President, Great Dictator, or Big Daddy just scuttles under some Third World rock to settle down and enjoy the retirement benefits of a Swiss bank account. In AN HONORABLE DEFEAT, we have a more satisfying story.<br />As General Robert E. Lee's defense of the South's capital became untenable, President Jefferson Davis evacuated Richmond on April 1, 1865 with his Cabinet Secretaries: John Breckinridge (War), Judah Benjamin (State), John Reagan (Postmaster General), George Trenholm (Treasury), Stephen Mallory (Navy), and George Davis (Attorney General). Heading south by train, wagon, horse, and finally for some, boat, this narrative chronicles the sad odyssey. Oh, and let's not forget the one-half million dollars in coin from the Confederate Treasury, as well as the deposits held by Richmond banks, that went with them.<br />The escape route eventually led through the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida. The goal for all was either to get out of the country entirely, or to join up with Confederate forces west of the Mississippi and continue the fight. Few made it. The narrative focuses chiefly on Jefferson Davis, Breckinridge, and Benjamin. The reader can only be amazed at Jeff's stubborn state of denial. He was convinced that the war could be continued (and won!) if only he could join any remaining Confederate force still in the field. Finally, though, he's redeemed when he puts his family above all other considerations.<br />If there's a &quot;hero&quot; in this saga, it's Breckinridge, who labored mightily, against his President's fixation, to bring the conflict to an honorable close rather than a farce, and in doing so save Southern lives and property. The Secretary of War's ultimate daring and perilous escape by small boat to Cuba is the stuff of legend, if not a good Hollywood movie.<br />Benjamin, the ever-jolly Secretary of State with no more demand for his statecraft, just thought of himself. He never looked back, and got the furthest.<br />Author William Davis does a magnificent job tying together the potentially confusing escape routes and timelines of the various fugitives, who sometimes travelled together, split up, and then rejoined. The text is supplemented by a perfectly adequate map and a section of photographs. The post-war loose ends of all concerned are tidied up in an Aftermath chapter.<br />And the Confederate monies? Most was disbursed in payment to escort troops and for supplies en route, or was ultimately confiscated by the Yankees. However, $170,000 in gold was looted by raiders in Georgia. As the author dryly notes:<br />&quot;... the stolen treasure ... was never seen again. Locals years hence told of friends who removed to Missouri and California with sudden fortunes, never to return.&quot; California, yes.

On the very first page, the two learn that the dismembered body of their 7-year old daughter, Ginny, has been discovered. Shortly thereafter, the suspected perp, a convicted child molester named Kindell, is cornered. Before the man is taken in for booking, Tim is given an opportunity by the arresting officers to execute the suspect. Left alone with Kindell, the slimeball gives Tim the hint that there was an accomplice, so Tim allows him to be taken into formal custody hoping the subsequent investigation will yield more information. But it doesn't, and the court sets the accused free on a technicality. Soon thereafter, Tim is approached by The Committee, a vigilante group of five men and one woman proposing to act as judge and jury on seven high profile murder cases where the suspect has gone free. They want Tim to join their deliberations, and then execute those condemned. The bait is the seventh and last case, which is Kindell's. Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time by all concerned.<br />There's much that author Gregg Hurwitz does right in this book. His prose skillfully depicts gritty and suspenseful action. The dialog is well constructed. (My pet peeve about too many potboilers is that all characters &quot;sound&quot; the same.) Rackley himself has a clever bag of tricks from years of military and law enforcement experience that makes him an eminently dangerous man. He knows how to booby-trap a .357 pistol so it blows off the shooter's hand, or pack an audio earpiece with explosive so it blows off a head. He can simulate infected needle tracks using a syringe full of Visine, Comet cleanser, and a crushed vitamin C tablet. He pulls metal fragments out of his body using nothing but Advil, hydrogen peroxide, and a tweezers. Don't try these parlor tricks at home.<br />My biggest problem with the novel, compelling me to shave off a star, is that I never felt more than indifference towards Rackley. Yes, the murder of Tim's daughter and the subsequent downward spiral of his marriage did inspire sympathy. Yes, I was riveted by his consummate and deadly resourcefulness. But there was nothing about the man that was particularly engaging. I think of other fictional action series heroes whose quirks make them endearing. Trouble-magnet Munch Mancini (by Barbara Seranella), who has a smart-mouth response to life in general. Ex-military cop Jack Reacher (by Lee Child), a rugged individualist so out of the mainstream that he hasn't a clue how to iron a shirt or manage a household budget. Or skip tracer Stephanie Plum (by Janet Evanovich), who's basically just a klutz. Even Eastwood's Dirty Harry persona had his catchy sayings (&quot;Are ya feeling lucky, punk?&quot;) Rackley is nothing of the sort. And while this didn't prevent me from finishing the book, it would, oddly enough, keep me from buying other novels by the same author. A hero with a likability quotient means that much.home.<br />My biggest problem with the novel, compelling me to shave off a star, is that I never felt more than indifference towards Rackley.

I was afraid that Sharon Kay Penman's treatment of the beginning of that tale in her historical novel WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT would be a frivolous chick-book. Not so.<br /><br />It's 1135, and England's monarch, Henry I, dies. His designated heir is his daughter Matilda, the widow of the German Emperor, who's now married to Count Geoffrey of Anjou. However, many of England's nobles are unwilling to kneel to a woman, and so they persuade Matilda's cousin Stephen, the son of Henry I's sister Adela, to claim the throne. Thus follows a nineteen-year civil war as Matilda contests for the crown, first for herself and then for her first-born son by Geoffrey, Henry. King Stephen fights for himself, and for the right of his son, Eustace, to inherit.<br /><br />If this book had been pure fiction, the author could have been faulted for dragging it out over 738 paper-backed pages as the fortunes of war see-saw back and forth, and England's powerful land barons change from one side to the other, and back again. But the major events of the conflict are all based on historical fact, and one wonders why JC and his saints would sleep so long while the countryside and its inhabitants were caught between opposing sides and brutalized. Were they on illegal substances, you think?<br /><br />During the first five-hundred or so pages, before young Henry is of sufficient age to take serious part in the bloodletting , the author displays fancy footwork in providing a protagonist for the reader to like. After all, Stephen makes an odd villain. He's an honorable man, loving father and husband, and a courageous soldier - but a poor king. Matilda, on the other hand, is brave, steadfast, and a loving mother, but infuriatingly tactless and totally inept at winning and keeping the loyalty of her potential English subjects. So, Penman creates the easy-going character of Ranulf, a fictional illegitimate son of Henry I and a loyal supporter of his half-sister in the wearisome struggle. As Ranulf follows Matilda from slaughter to slaughter and crisis to crisis, he has the time to carry on an adulterous affair with an old flame, and then find his own true love in the mountain fastness of Wales. (Come to think of it, maybe this is too much a chick-book!) In any case, at the risk of unnecessarily extending the storyline, he makes for an engaging character.<br /><br />The last two-hundred pages pick up as the young Henry meets Eleanor of Aquitaine, who's then married to King Louis of France. It's during this last part of an excellent book that we see the man and monarch that Henry is to become, and which makes me look forward to the next volume in the trilogy, TIME AND CHANCE, especially since, through my knowledge of English history, I know what's going to happen. Count Geoffrey otherwise gives us a clue when he advises his eldest son:<br /><br />\\"The best marriages are those based upon detached goodwill or benign indifference. But unfortunately for you, the one emotion you will never feel for Eleanor of Aquitaine is indifference.\\" How true.<br /><br />For anyone interested in the genesis of the Plantagenet royal dynasty of England, this well-researched book is a pure delight.<br /><br />P.S. 5/18/10: Matilda was known as \\"Matilda of England\\", perhaps named for her mother \\"Matilda of Scotland.\\" Penman consistently refers to Matilda as \\"Maude\\", by which she was also known and which is, of course, useful when distinguishing her from Stephen's wife \\"Matilda of Boulogne\\". One who has commented on this review insists that I call her \\"Maude\\" within the review. I'm not going to do so but will recognize the viewpoint so as to be inclusive of both names for historical completeness.ctional illegitimate son of Henry I and a loyal supporter of his half-sister in the wearisome struggle.

After his freshman year at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Homer wants to join his mother at her new house in Myrtle Beach, a coastal resort in South Carolina. But there's been a fatal accident back in the mine at Coalwood, and Homer's Dad, the mine superintendent, is under investigation by state and federal agencies. So, Mom tells Homer to go back home and keep his Dad company. And, as readers of the series know, Elsie Hickam is not one to trifle with.<br />SKY OF STONE is, I think, certainly superior to THE COALWOOD WAY, and perhaps even to ROCKET BOYS. It's in this third volume that Homer emerges from adolescence. He comes to grips with his parents' increasing estrangement from each other, his father's emotional distance, the loss of beloved pets, and the primacy of his older brother in his father's affections. Then there's Homer's first serious crush, the object being Rita, a junior mining engineer several years his senior. Finally, to pay off damage done to his father's Buick, Homer defies both parents, joins the United Mine Workers of America, moves out of the family home, and goes to work in the coal mine as a summer job. (SKY OF STONE refers to the ceiling of solid rock over the mine's tunnels.)<br />Homer's semi-dysfunctional family remains a source of reader sympathy. Over one weekend, young Hickam resides with the Likens family, the menfolk of which are going to improve their guest's softball skills. (Homer's been drafted by the union team that will play management on the Fourth of July.) At breakfast, Homer notices:<br />&quot;(Mrs. Likens) smiled lovingly at her husband, and I thought again how much I envied her family. They all just seemed to like each other.&quot; The poignancy of this observation is heartbreaking.<br />Hickam self-deprecating humor makes him an eminently likable protagonist. He sets out to that July 4th showdown on the baseball diamond with the thought:<br />&quot;... I had, in fact, only two hopes: one, that I wouldn't hit myself with the bat, and the other, that nobody would hit a ball in my direction.&quot; But, Homer rises to the occasion, much to the satisfaction of the reader.<br />Since, in the book's epilogue, Homer's narrative summarizes his life since that maturing summer of '61, I assume that SKY OF STONE is to be the last in the Coalwood series, which has been a genuine piece of true-life Americana. I shall miss it.<br />According to the author, Coalwood's mine has long since shut down, and the town itself barely exists as a place on the map anymore. However, there's a museum there dedicated to the town's mining heritage and the exploits of the Rocket Boys. Homer's books leave me wanting to travel across country to visit.

It's also a sequel to her previous book BLOOMING, in which she recollects her experiences growing up in Ames, Iowa in the late 40s and early 50s. Taken together, the books are a coming-of-age story that might apply in some degree to any average American who grew up and went off to college during that period. It's a gently self-deprecating and perceptive memoir from a woman who writes with the hindsight achieved by age forty.<br />Most of IVY DAYS - a relatively short work at 199 paperbacked pages - relates to Smith. The trauma of leaving home to live in a house with strangers of the same sex and age. The awkward process of fitting-in, which included learning how to smoke, drink socially, survive at mixers, and, most importantly, acquire a steady boyfriend. The sifting through the various academic disciplines with the purpose of declaring a major. The pressure of living up to the academic expectations of others and self. Friendships. Petty enmities. Confusion. Disappointment. Depression. Elation. Insecurities. Triumphs. Defeats. Boredom. Excitement. The patchwork quilt of life.<br />It's in the last chapter, &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;, where Susan briefly mentions her initial brief trip to London and England. This first exposure eventually blossomed into an affectionate connection to that island nation that produced the delightful travel essays (MY LOVE AFFAIR WITH ENGLAND, ENGLAND FOR ALL SEASONS, ENGLAND AS YOU LIKE IT) that first drew my attention to this author. I myself love the place more than I can say, and, in this regard, Susan and I are soulmates. I wish I could sit down with her over High Tea and just talk.<br />There's a an occasional bittersweetness to Susan's words, especially when it comes to the subject of men, or at least finding the right one. Having grown up with the ingrained notion that &quot;someday your Prince will come&quot;, she ruefully writes at one point:<br />&quot;I had never stopped to consider what would happen if he came, and I couldn't get him to talk to me.&quot;<br />Finally, at Berkeley, she meets the man she was to wed, have a child with, and ultimately divorce. (Happily, she's since remarried to James, her boon companion for the journey to other countries and old age. The reader meets him in Susan's England trilogy, and he seems a first-rate fellow.)<br />IVY DAYS, like BLOOMING, isn't a can't-put-down book.

Desperate times call for desperate measures, so ex-discount lingerie buyer Stephanie Plum goes to work for cousin Vinnie, a bail bondsman, as a skip tracer, i.e. a bounty hunter who retrieves those who've skipped bail.<br />In ONE FOR THE MONEY, author Janet Evanovich kick starts Stephanie's new career. Plum immediately jumps into the proverbial deep end by convincing a skeptical Vinnie to give her a chance at finding Joe Morelli, a local cop accused of murder. The finder's fee is 10 grand, and that'll buy a lot of chow nuggets for Rex, Stephanie's pet hamster.<br />Plum's considerable appeal lies in her complete ineptitude for her new career. (It doesn't help that she and Morelli have a &quot;past&quot;. At six, she'd allowed Joe to play train under her skirt in Old Man Morelli's garage. At sixteen, Stephanie was relieved by Joe of her virginity behind the pastry counter at the bakery where she worked. At nineteen, she intentionally clipped Morelli with the right front fender of her Dad's Buick.) Within the first few days on the job, Plum finds Joe four times, but fails to make the bust, a tough assignment if your quarry leaves you buck naked, dripping wet, and handcuffed to your own shower curtain rod. Or your car keys have been tossed into the putrid muck at the bottom of a dipsy-dumpster.<br />Another source of amusement for the reader is Stephanie's family: Mom, Dad, and Grandma Mazur. The inspiration for Grandma might well have been Dorothy's mother Sophia on the TV series GOLDEN GIRLS.<br />ONE FOR THE MONEY was originally published in 1994. This paperback edition was published in 2003. In the intervening nine years, seven additional Stephanie Plum adventures have been added to the series. In the back of this edition, there's a brief synopsis of all eight novels to date, which also defines for each book the &quot;Historic Moment&quot;, &quot;New Characters Introduced&quot;, and &quot;Automotive Factoid&quot;. It's apparent that Evanovich continues with the personalities introduced in ONE FOR THE MONEY, as well as bring in new ones.

HOLDING THE ZERO, by Gerald Seymour, is at least equal, if not better, in portraying the sniper's esoteric art.<br />It's a couple of years before Operation Iraqi Freedom, and the British government receives word of a sighting of one of Her Majesty's subjects roaming northern Iraq with a bloody big sniper rifle and a band of Kurdish fighters led by a charismatic peasant girl, Meda. The witness even provides a name, Augustus Henderson Peake. Captain Willet of the Ministry of Defense is tasked, along with a representative from the Security Service, to investigate Peake and report on his mind set, motivation and training. How much trouble can Peake cause for Her Majesty's government? From the very beginning, Willet knows that Peake has no military background, is the transport manager in an English haulage firm, and is a civilian, award-winning, target shooter. Willet's initial assessment is that Peake will not survive whatever foolish venture in which he's involved himself.<br />In the meantime, Peake is Meda's secret weapon as her growing band of Kurds advances out of its mountain fastness and wins a series of increasingly ambitious skirmishes with Saddam Hussein's army. The ultimate goal is to take Kirkuk, headquarters of the Iraqi Fith Army and a city sacred to the Kurdish nationalists. The Iraqi Army sends out its best sniper, Major Karim Aziz, to intercept and kill Meda's sharpshooter.<br />HOLDING THE ZERO is one of the more complex of Seymour's novels that I've read to date. There's a plethora of interesting characters besides Augustus himself: Meda, Aziz, Meda's military advisor Haquim, Peake's guide and spotter Omar, Aziz's tracker dog Scout, Willet, the minefield-clearer Joe Denton, the Mossad agent Isaac Cohen, and the relief worker Sarah. Ironically, in the Big Picture of a CIA plot to topple Saddam, Aziz and Peake are on the same side, and it's ultimately only mano-a-mano pride which matches each against the other.<br />As in all of Seymour's thrillers, the Good Guys don't always win, and the Bad Guys don't always lose. At the conclusion, one must tally up the body count to decide whose side owns the victory - and it's often Pyrrhic.<br />As we peer over the shoulder of Willet as he unearths the nature of the man Peake and composes his report, we also march along with Augustus on the journey that will prove Willet right or wrong. At the end of the day in an isolated Iraqi valley, we must stand amazed.ure of a CIA plot to topple Saddam, Aziz and Peake are on the same side, and it's ultimately only mano-a-mano pride which matches each against the other.<br />As in all of Seymour's thrillers, the Good Guys don't always win, and the Bad Guys don't always lose.

BAND OF BROTHERS is a tribute to these individuals in general and, in particular, to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division.<br />The book begins with Company E's formation in July 1942, and ends with its inactivation on November 30, 1945. It's a narrative history based on letters, diaries, news clippings and personal interviews. It spans the company's training in the United States and England, its combat roles in the D-Day invasion, the subsequent Operation Market Garden, and the defense of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, and ends with the capture of Hitler's Alpine retreat, Berchtesgaden, and the last months as an occupying force in Austria. There's a stark contrast between Company E's sojourn in the Hell of battle and its occupation duty, the latter characterized by author Stephen Ambrose as a &quot;soldier's dream life&quot; of &quot;mountain weather, unlimited sports, women and booze, easy duty, (and) good hunting&quot;.<br />Company E's full complement was 140 men - 8 officers and 132 enlisted. But, as casualties mounted, original members were replaced with new, and the cast of characters is large. At times, BAND OF BROTHERS is more a series of vividly drawn vignettes featuring named individuals in the context of a particular combat operation. The reader never really gets to &quot;know&quot; any one soldier, with the exception of perhaps Dick Winters, who provides a continuity of sorts. Winters began as a 2nd Lieutenant commanding a platoon, and ended the war as a Major commanding the 2nd Battalion. To the degree that the author allows, Winters is the foremost hero of a group of heroes, i.e. all of E Company. The reader is thus forced to identify with the unit as a whole throughout its travails and final triumph. This was the author's intent, and is the book's ultimate strength. In the paperback edition, there are only eight pages of photographs and two of maps. One wishes for more. The last chapter on post-war careers is a nice, and logically necessary, touch.<br />Most war-centered works of non-fiction focus on the &quot;great commanders&quot; - Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Nelson, Washington, Lee, Grant, Rommel, Montgomery, Eisenhower, Patton, MacArthur, etc. BAND OF BROTHERS is the best book I can recall on the experiences of the common soldier - the guy in the front trench whose only reward at the end of hostilities, if he lives, is a wound or two, a souvenir enemy pistol or flag, and the greatest of all, a feeling of comradeship with his fellows that lasts for life.

UNDER THE BLACK FLAG is the perfect read for anyone who, as a kid, dressed up as a one-eyed pirate and went around waving a cardboard cutlass saying, &quot;Aaargh, speak up bilge rat; where be the treasure?&quot; Or anyone who enters company staff meetings with, &quot;Ahoy tharr, scurvy dogs, shark meat ya'll be.&quot; Or, &quot;Are ya feeling lucky, punk?&quot; (Well, perhaps that last is from a more recent era.)<br />Since he's writing for Western audiences, Author David Cordingly focuses on the pirates, buccaneers, and corsairs of European background, who infested the waters of the Atlantic and Indian oceans and the Caribbean during the 17th and 18th centuries. The book's twelve chapters reveal everything you've ever wanted to know about swashbuckling pirates and piracy: the ships, pirate flags, buried treasure, recruitment, plunderings, pirate violence, famous captains (e.g. Kidd, Blackbeard, Morgan, Rackam, Vane, Roberts), women pirates, pirates' women, pirate life on land and sea, marooning, walking the plank, pirate islands and haunts, pirates in the media (books, stage plays, films), pirate trials and executions, wooden legs and, yes, parrots.<br />Upon finishing UNDER THE BLACK FLAG, I tried to think of a reason not to award five stars, and couldn't. The volume is extensively researched, well organized, written with the popular audience in mind, eminently instructive, and not without humor. Sixteen pages of photographs complement the text. If you're interested in the topic, I can't recommend it too highly. Aaargh!<br />By the way, what does &quot;shiver me timbers&quot; mean, anyway?	2003-07-02

That's the position taken by author Patricia Cornwell in the first 20 pages of PORTRAIT OF A KILLER. She then goes another 341 pages to prove the point.<br />Cornwell, otherwise known for her crime novels, has penned an exhaustive, and sometimes exhausting, investigation of the Jack the Ripper murders, which took place in London's East End in 1888. Since the premise of the narrative is that the Ripper was the renowned, German-born, English artist William Sickert, it's also an examination of that man's life, art and presumed psychology. Not to put too fine a point on it, he was a real whack-job. Certifiably psychopathic. Early on, the author asserts that Sickert's rage against the prostitutes he butchered stemmed from a physical inability to have sex, a condition resulting from several (botched) surgeries he endured as a 5-year old to correct congenitally malformed genitalia. Yup, I suspect that would do it.<br />Cornwell details everything you ever wanted to know about the five murders traditionally attributed to the Ripper: the victims (Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddows, Kelly), the East End environment, the crime scenes, the condition of the corpses as found, and the autopsies. As background, she describes the state of the metropolitan police force of the time, and the reasons it was ill-equipped to find a serial killer, particularly Sickert. Of course, she also reconstructs the artist's erratic and eccentric London lifestyle that caused him to roam the East End, utilizing skills at disguise learned as an actor, in search of victims. Casting her investigative net wider, the author establishes links between Sickert and many of the more than 200 so-called Ripper Letters mailed to the police and newspapers during the period of the murders and the years immediately following. Furthermore, she notes details in Sickert's own paintings and drawings that suggest an up-close and personal familiarity with each individual homicide. He had to have been there. According to Scotland Yard, the circumstantial evidence compiled by Cornwell would be sufficient to place before the crown prosecutor.<br />Cornwell also makes the case that Sickert continued his slaughters (beyond the traditional five) up to as late as 1907.<br />Since the conclusion of PORTRAIT OF A KILLER is foregone, the author leaves the most hideous of the Ripper's killings, that of Mary Kelly, until last. Cornwell doesn't specifically say so, but perhaps  this was the most gruesome because Sickert was indoors and safe from interruption rather than on exposed streets as with the previous four. He had the luxury of time and privacy to give full vent to his fury. It's a horrific vision.<br />Though there's no evidence that Sickert ever had a child - certainly consistent with the hypothesis that he was physically unable to engage in normal sex - a story persists that he had an illegitimate son by a Frenchwoman. This is a loose end in Cornwell's narrative - one apparently beyond her ability to resolve at this late date. (Remember, it's her assertion that Sickert's inability to perform sexually was at the root of his violent frenzies.) Otherwise, PORTRAIT OF A KILLER, with its three useful sections of photographs, is a compelling and convincing indictment of the artist, and a must-read for Jack the Ripper obsessives and fans of Patricia Cornwell.ach individual homicide.

It's now 1961, and Earl takes time off from his day job to investigate the disappearance of a lawyer pal who's traveled on legal business to the Thebes State Penal Farm (Colored), a Mississippi prison for Negroes cut-off from the rest of the world in the swamps of the state's southeast corner. What Swagger discovers is a hell-hole of officially sanctioned viciousness that makes Stalin's gulags seem tame by comparison. As a meddling outsider, Earl is detained there himself and almost loses his life and sanity. After finally escaping, he returns to exact righteous vengeance.<br />The first half of PALE HORSE COMING is perhaps its best. It's the survival story of Earl amidst the horrors of Thebes, not the least of which is the psychopathic overseer, the albino Bigboy, who enjoys torturing prisoners to death with a bullwhip. To enhance the dramatic effect of Swagger's fight for his life, the Thebes facility is perhaps overembellished. Wrought in iron over its main gate are the words, &quot;Work Will Set You Free.&quot; Haven't we seen that before, as in &quot;Arbeit Macht Frei&quot;, associated with other camps of infamy? Somehow, I don't think Mississippi deserves such a bad PR rap - even in fiction.<br />The book's second half strains credulity. The author apparently has a love of the Old West as he has Earl returning to Thebes with a posse of retired gunslingers - one of whom is in his eighties - to expunge the place from the map. Swagger includes in his trigger-happy band a character named Audie Ryan, America's most decorated WWII soldier and now a movie star, who's obviously modeled on the real-life Audie Murphy. Oh, puhleeze! And it doesn't help that the U.S. government is involved with Thebes in the obligatory Sinister Secret Project - your tax dollars at work.<br />Had I thought that Hunter wrote the ending tongue-in-cheek as a parody, I might have been more forgiving. However, I suspect he was serious, and the result is too clever by half. As it is, I'm awarding four stars because it remains a gripping and entertaining read. And that's why I spend good money for a cheap thriller, right?<br />In the film PALE RIDER, which reworks the earlier SHANE with a stronger &quot;Death rides a pale horse&quot; theme, Clint Eastwood's Man-With-No-Name character wipes out the Bad Guys all by himself. For me, the Lone Hero has always held more appeal.obviously modeled on the real-life Audie Murphy. Oh, puhleeze!

Not the recreational type, but rather lithium, Haldol, Thorazine and Depakone. He sees the psychopharmacologist more often than you or I visit the supermarket. Thus chemically supported, Will's self-appointed purpose in life, his \\"epic quest\\", is to stop the spread of Information Sickness (IS). As he explains, IS is caused by:<br />\\"A virus that makes people think, and occasionally laugh, too much. Once they realize they exist in a universe of infinite and often contradictory truths, they die. Shock, system overload.\\"<br />The villain of the piece is the evil, tenured professor, Dr. Bones, who created IS in the process of developing a fat-free foodstuff. Bones is assisted by the gorgeous supermodel, Crystal Goodlay. Will's faithful Kimosabe is his laptop's advisor software, Spunky.<br />I won't say that WILL EPICQWEST.COM is unfunny, or unclever, or without nuggets of insight. Through his wired hero, author Tom Grimes creates snappy, smart-alecky humor about everything from capitalism, Western philosophy, absent Dad's, the democratic elective process, female self-empowerment, the male value system, women's breasts, investment strategy, automated answering systems, to medical care. It's sort of a stand-up comedy routine in 184 pages, and the epic quest to halt IS is just a vehicle to provide continuity. Unfortunately, like Chinese food, even the best stand-up routine leaves me feeling empty after thirty minutes and wondering what all the fuss was about. By page 150, I was in a hurry just to finish and move on to something more substantial, more useful, and/or more instructive. This book is perhaps best read in its entirety on a long plane ride, and you can leave it in the seat pocket in front of you when you get off.	2003-06-19

DREAMS OF RESCUE is her first book in the \\"mystery\\" genre.<br />It's the dead of winter, and Juliana Smythe is alone in her summer house, an 1899 Victorian, overlooking Lake Bonticou. Juliana, an actress in cinematic thrillers she collectively calls FemJep (translated as \\"women in peril\\"), is separated from her husband Matt after an incident of volcanic domestic violence on New Year's Eve for which Juliana was granted a protection order by the court. Now it's February, and there are to be additional hearings. Juliana's trepidation is almost palpable. Does she have enough money to pay the lawyers? Will the court discontinue the protection order? Will Matt return to the house, protection order or not, and again visit his rage on his wife?<br />Juliana shares with the reader memories of her marriage, from her first date with Matt seventeen years previous, through the spring, summer and fall of the relationship to the present, the agonizing winter. At one point, Juliana muses:<br />\\"How long does it take an eighteen-year-old girl to fall in love? About ten minutes.\\" (That's about nine minutes longer than a testosterone-fueled, eighteen-year-old boy brought to a halt by a whiff of perfume and a view of bare skin.)<br />As an actress that sees her life as an extended movie script, Juliana DREAMS OF RESCUE - by the kindly lawyer or psychologist or next-door neighbor who'll sweep her into his arms and protect and love her. But reality isn't like that, is it? What's High Drama on the Silver Screen reduces to the mundane in the day-to-day drudge. This is to be Juliana's learning curve.<br />I was immediately intrigued as to the nature of the \\"Thing in the Box\\", a piece of evidence Juliana is to present at the next court hearing that will surely convince the judge of Matt's psychological instability. What a clever tease for the reader!<br />I'm one of the author's biggest fans, having given five stars to all of her previous works. This time, however, I'm bereft to report something less. By the time the nature of the \\"Thing in the Box\\" is revealed, the main plot thread has been frayed by tangential events. What's with the creepy vacuum repairman, who, on a housecall to service Juliana's Supralux 699, may have committed the sin of Onan on her mohair shawl? Or the mysterious neighbor across the lake who watches her with a telescope? Or the pervert who breathes heavily over the phone on late night calls? And what about those seven young girls found naked and frozen to death on the lake's ice back in the late 1890s? Was it murder most foul? Indeed, with all the other enigmas resolving themselves, the final court confrontation with Matt is anticlimactic. The storyline, while not becoming uninteresting, just lost its focus, and I finished the book feeling vaguely unsatisfied.<br />I suspect that there's a lot of Laura in Juliana, especially evident when the latter remembers the loss of her mother at an early age (as the author recalls in SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS). In any case, Cunningham's forte in all her books has been describing her protagonist's feelings. And this reader was immediately absorbed into Juliana's emotional life. I cared about her throughout.

PAGAN HOLIDAY is descriptive, instructive and marvelously entertaining - prerequisites, in my opinion, for a 5-star travel essay.<br />Author Tony Perrottet follows the tourist route of the ancient Romans from Italy to Greece to Turkey to Egypt.  It's vaguely reminiscent of Eric Newby's ON THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN. Newby traveled his route with his long-suffering wife, Wanda. Tony is accompanied by his significant other, Les, who raises the bar on tolerance and patience by enduring the trek through the second trimester of pregnancy into the third. In the Acknowledgments, Perrottet gives his intrepid companion credit: \\"All of the best jokes in the book are hers.\\"<br />Starting in Rome, the high points of the itinerary include Naples, Capri, Pompeii, Athens, Corinth, Sparta, Olympia, Delphi, Delos, Rhodes, Ephesus, Pergamum, Troy, Alexandria, Cairo, Thebes, Aswan, and points in between. Tony describes the experiences, both good and bad, of the old Romans on that same pilgrim path, as well as those of Les and himself. Of course, some of the most entertaining for the reader were the worst for the traveler, as when Tony and Les rent a Russian car, a Donco, for tooling around Greece. By the time they approach Sparta:<br />\\"... we'd taped a sheet of plastic over the broken window, and tied coat-hanger wire around my door so it wouldn't pop open whenever the car stopped ...\\"<br />And the ancients had their own horrors to contend with, as a certain Apollinarius Sidonius experienced during his night's stay in a \\"greasy tavern\\":<br />\\"His hard-reed bed was hopping with lice; all night, lizards and spiders fell from the ceiling.\\"<br />Whether diving the ruins in the Bay of Naples, consulting a present-day Delphic oracle, dealing with border customs officials, contending with crowded beaches and erratic ferry schedules, exploring the remnants of Troy or the interior of the Great Pyramid, coping with on-the-road illness, examining mummies up close and personal, barging down the Nile, bar crawling in Alexandria, or changing rooms (five times) at Cairo's Windsor Hotel, Tony and Les proceed with a great, good humor probably stretched thin many times during the odyssey. And what he doesn't experience himself, Tony does his best to describe from the accounts of others, such as the consultation of omens, the Olympic Games, a gladiatorial show, Roman seaside orgies, and a Roman bath.<br />Perrottet fills his narrative with fun, arcane trivia. Did you know that Delphic love philters included such ingredients as horse sweat and minced lizard's flesh? Or that a twenty-five percent duty was levied on dancing girls brought back as souvenirs? Or that Greek female hoteliers had the occasional reputation of being witches, who turned male guests into frogs or sex slaves?.<br />The text in PAGAN HOLIDAY is interspersed with illustrations, including some photos taken himself, but more often from other sources. Tony found paintings by Lawrence Alma-Tadena particularly useful. The one photo sorely missing was that of the hardiest trooper of them all, Les.<br />And Mummy's Armpit? It's the slang name for a smelly Nile wine.

This from a person that puts covers on his books to keep them looking pristine.<br />The plot is simple enough. An Evil Conspiracy has taken control of the weather. It puts the U.S. government on notice that if laws aren't passed that restore the environment, laws such as putting a moratorium on the production of fossil fuel burning vehicles and prohibiting logging or the importation of wood products, then there'll be hell to pay. And there's the suitably cataclysmic, de rigueur, demonstration of capability.<br />THE GREENHOUSE CONSPIRACY is certainly no better or worse than the bulk of the pulp in the \\"thriller\\" aisle of your local bookstore. The characters are stereotypes you've run across gazillions of times before. The Hero, Luke, is an ex-Marine pilot - square-jawed and steely eyed, no doubt - who travels with his faithful Newfoundland, Scannon. The heroine and love interest, Michelle, is a computer-hacker extraordinaire. She's also smart, rich, blond, and built like a brick you-know-what. Then there's the sadistic villain, Max, who works for The Boss. Included in the cast are an egotistical TV-news personality, an over-the-top Army general, a computer nerd with hi-tech toys, a FEMA scientist beset by male chauvinism, and lying, self-serving politicians. Moreover, all the characters except Scannon \\"sound\\" the same - a pet peeve of mine when it comes to fiction. The action and dialog are eminently predictable, sometimes even corny, as when Luke rescues Michelle from danger by carrying her off on a horse. (At least it wasn't a white horse!) And a typical line of dialog, this spoken by Luke in a crisis:<br />\\"Do you think the marines rushing the hill at Iwo Jima had a choice?  When your country calls, you have to answer, regardless of the consequences or the sacrifice.\\" Okey-dokey. Let's win one for The Gipper while we're at it.<br />And above all, there's - imagine a God or James Earl Jones voice-over here against a backdrop of kettledrums  - \\"The Power of the Pyramid\\".<br />There's one thing I especially liked about this volume; it's a very fast read. So, if like me, you have too many books on your shelf waiting to be devoured, you won't fret about the time spent on this one.<br />This isn't a bad book; it'll probably sell well enough to the author's satisfaction. Since I'm a Nice Guy, I'll even give it three stars. But it's all so excruciatingly ordinary, and not just a little silly. After decades of reading (mostly trash), I want something more clever, more original, more believable and - say it ain't so, Joe - more intelligent. And above all, something I wouldn't take to the beach without a cover.Gipper while we're at it.<br />And above all, there's - imagine a God or James Earl Jones voice-over here against a backdrop of kettledrums  - \\"The Power of the Pyramid\\".<br />There's one thing I especially liked about this volume; it's a very fast read.

More accurately, perhaps, the volume is a superficial history of psychiatric care in the United States, or at least as practiced in the Boston area, using McLean as a backdrop.<br />Mental health care has come a long way from less enlightened times when, according to author Alex Beam, terrorizing patients into wellness was considered effective:<br />\\"One German asylum lowered patients into a dungeon filled with snakes.\\" (My mother, a psychiatrist, once told me about a patient of hers who saw pink snakes on the ceiling. Hmmm, I wonder where Mom did her residency.)<br />The narrative is at its best when describing the evolution of 19th and 20th century methods of therapy: cold water dunking, bath treatments (hot air, electric light, vapor, salt, sitz, loofah), insulin coma, electroshock, metrazole shock, lobotomy, Freudian analysis, and psychopharmacology. Unfortunately, the author fleshes out the text by describing the experiences of specifically named individuals undergoing such cures, usually at McLean. It was then that my eyes began to glaze over and GRACEFULLY INSANE becomes almost a work of local interest since most of the inmates came from Boston's social upper crust, which regarded the hospital as a handy dumping ground for mentally challenged and inconvenient family members.<br />I was briefly re-invigorated when a 1948 sex scandal involving McLean's psychiatrist-in-chief and a nurse got the pair prosecuted on a Morals Charge (Oh, puhleeze!). And later in the 60s and 70s, when the badly behaved teenage children of the local gentry, relegated to the institution by clueless parents for too much drugs, sex, and rock 'n' roll, upset the traditionally genteel environment.<br />While mildly entertaining and reasonably informative, GRACEFULLY INSANE came across as too much of a niche market product, appealing perhaps mostly to mental health professionals, residents of Boston and its environs, and fans of certain famous and terminally dysfunctional (i.e. suicidal) poets of New England heritage. I don't fall into any of these categories, though I'm now sufficiently interested to purchase THE BELL JAR and MOUNT MISERY, the former by Sylvia Plath based on her sojourn at McLean, and the latter by Dr. Stephen Bergman (pen name Samuel Shem) based on his medical residency there.<br />I'll give GRACEFULLY INSANE to my Mom.

And she claims she's pregnant. Honorable and smitten - mostly the latter - Willi stages a boating accident on Lake Geneva. Under the ruse of having drowned, he defects to England so he can be joined forever with his beloved. During Guttmann's debrief, MI6 learns that, while Willi has no inherent value, his father Otto is the brain behind a new, Soviet, anti-tank weapon. Using Willi as bait, the Secret Service hatches a plot to lure the 70-year old scientist into defecting to the West during an upcoming holiday that the old man will be taking with daughter Erica near the West German border. MI6 contracts with Johnny Donoghue to be point man in the extraction.<br />Seymour's thrillers are notable for their lack of clear-cut winners and losers in whatever confrontation is played out. CONTRACT has more tragic figures than any of the author's other books I've read. Donoghue is an ex-Army officer, cashiered after having mistakenly shot an innocent young woman while on surveillance duty in Northern Ireland. The court acquitted him of murder, but his career and reputation were ruined. Johnny now craves redemption with the government that gave him the boot. There's silly Willi, who has no idea of the misery he will cause. There's Erica, a spinster-in-training, who has no life but to care for her frail father. Then there's Ulf, a young East German recently demobbed from duty with the border guards. Ulf's in love with Jutte, and she's cajoled him into a joint bolt over the wire. Not tragic, but just bitter, is the anonymous functionary in the West German Federal Internal Security Service, who's still smarting from his treatment at the hands of the Brits at the end of WWII. He'll show them.<br />I've been raving about Gerald Seymour for years. He's equal to, if not better than, John le Carre in his ability to conjure up an entertaining espionage caper. His plots don't bog down, and his characters are eminently believable - just regular blokes with bills to pay, aging bodies, lackluster careers and/or nagging spouses endeavoring to do their duty to Queen and country, or their conscience, amidst perilous situations in grotty places.

Perhaps author Mary Roach thought the title of her book, STIFF, too ghoulish because she immediately begins in a festive mood:<br />\\"... being dead is not terribly far off from being on a cruise ship.  Most of your time is spent lying on your back. The brain has shut down. The flesh begins to soften. Nothing much new happens, and nothing is expected of you.\\" Carnival, Viking, and Holland America, take note.<br />As a corpse, you can indeed, as on last summer's voyage to the Bahamas, veg out. Or, as the narrative reveals, be an integral part of other activities. Why, I didn't realize that being dead could be so lively.<br />First and foremost, your cadaver could become the prize of body snatchers, and subsequently be sold to a medical school for the instruction and amusement of students. Or perhaps you aspire to become a crash test dummy, fodder for the military's munitions tests, or the subject of experiments in composting, freeze-drying or plastination. If you're unlucky enough to die in an airplane disaster of unknown cause, investigators may scrutinize your body, or its widely scattered pieces, for clues as to where in the aircraft the fuselage cracked open or the bomb exploded. Your dissected brain or heart could fuel arguments over the seat of the soul, while other body parts serve as the raw material for disease remedies. Or maybe just be eaten by cannibals. And, if you're the outdoorsy type, you can recline in a grove on a grassy hillside behind the University of Tennessee Medical Center where the various stages of human decomposition are studied and recorded.<br />STIFF is one of the most fascinating books I've read recently, even after taking into account the \\"yuk\\" factor. (In ancient Rome, the blood of freshly slaughtered gladiators was thought to cure epilepsy, while modern day Web sites have recipes for Placenta Lasagna and Placenta Pizza for those who would consume the delicacy to stave off postpartum depression.) This is largely due to the author's chatty style and marvelous sense of humor, which is dry as a mummy. For example, when declaring the existence of a Central Park statue of a certain Dr. Sims, otherwise notable for describing a suitable patient position for gynecological exam, Roach writes in a footnote:<br />\\"If you don't believe me, you can look it up yourself, on page 56 of THE ROMANCE OF PROCTOLOGY. (Sims was apparently something of a dilettante when it came to bodily orifices.) P.S.: I could not, from cursory skimming, ascertain what the romance was.\\"<br />I highly recommend STIFF for the not too squeamish adult, or as a scary Halloween gift for one who is.

The preview at the end of this book introduces a new character, Emma Corrigan, first appearing in 2004 in CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET.<br />In CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC and SHOPAHOLIC TAKES MANHATTAN, Bloomwood is continuously rendered incapable of rational thought by the euphoria of material acquisition, usually clothes and other trinkets, using credit she doesn't have. In SHOPAHOLIC TIES THE KNOT, Becky's penchant for denial and disaster ascends to a higher plane after Luke Brandon, her carried-over boyfriend from the previous book, proposes marriage. Should she be joined with her Prince back home in Oxshott, England in a garden ceremony being lovingly organized by her dear Mum and Dad for their only daughter? Or married in a posh, extremely expensive affair at New York's Plaza Hotel, paid for by her despised mother-in-law-to-be, Elinor. If you know Becky, you'll realize there's no simple answer. Choosing one and saying \\"no\\" to the other just isn't an option.<br />Becky's ditziness has always been one of her most endearing (and exasperating) qualities (along with generosity and a basic good-heartedness), providing the reader with an unending stream of hilarious scenarios. Perhaps the single most side-splitting episode in this novel occurs when Becky's best friend Suze goes into premature labor while the two are on an afternoon outing in London. Not in possession of her going-to-the-hospital bag, Suze dispatches Becky into a department store to put one together - one that eventually includes an inflatable canoe!<br />Because SHOPAHOLIC TIES THE KNOT is apparently Becky's swan song, the last three chapters come across as a somewhat forced attempt to tidily end the saga of a rampantly untidy personality. Because of this, I almost gave less than the usual 5 stars to a Bloomwood adventure. But, I relented in the end because this series has been so consistently entertaining.

Now, decades later, I thought I'd investigate his prose - these 13 tales in RUDYARD KIPLING: THE BEST SHORT STORIES, written during the period 1889 -1904.<br />Kipling had an affinity for the common British soldier and civil servant standing duty on the far edges of Empire. Thus, several chapters feature such of the Queen's own, usually soldiers relating cautionary stories regarding relationships with women. (This is assuredly fertile ground for bivouac conversation, even today.) However, the thick dialect which the author faithfully re-creates in his hero of the moment sometimes makes for heavy going.<br />The author's writing style includes the occasional trick of animating animals and inanimate objects with a human voice and personality. Sometimes this worked for me, sometimes not. The former was best exemplified by \\"The Ship That Found Herself\\", a clever instruction about the structural parts of a steamship. Less entertaining was \\"The Maltese Cat\\", a dialogue among polo ponies during a big match. Perhaps if I'd understood the game better, or cared, it might have gone over more successfully.<br />On a scale of one star to five, I awarded no single story more than four. The least appreciated effort was \\"The Record of Badalia Herodsfoot\\", a depressing narrative set in the London slums that illustrates the adage, \\"No good deed goes unpunished.\\" Of the several fours, my favorite was \\"They\\", a poignant ghost story set in England's southern Downs that would've made, with a little tweaking, a good episode for the old TWILIGHT ZONE television series. However, even the former contained an astute observation worth noting here:<br />\\"... if people did not die so untidily, most men, and all women, would commit at least one murder in their lives.\\"<br />While Kipling is undeniably a great storyteller, I suspect that his writings had a greater appeal to readers contemporary with the author than those in the current millennium. Perhaps time has passed them by. One had to be there, especially to appreciate both Britain's paternal yet condescending attitude towards the subject denizens of its colonial possessions and once-new technologies that are today considered quaintly antiquated.<br />I'm glad I took the time to read this book, but am also happy to be finished and moving on to the next.his writings had a greater appeal to readers contemporary with the author than those in the current millennium.

Following that film, the real-life Greenlaw described her experience as the captain of a North Atlantic swordfishing boat in the riveting best seller, THE HUNGRY OCEAN. Now, in THE LOBSTER CHRONICLES, Linda has returned to her home island, Isle au Haut, Maine, to run a lobster boat.<br />Fishing for lobster isn't as potentially dangerous or dramatic as chasing swordfish. And it's more of a 9 to 5 job where you get to sleep at night under a roof in your own bed. So, while Greenlaw shares enough knowledge about lobstering for the reader to get a feel for it, the bulk of the book is about related (or unrelated) people and events: the effort by a town committee to acquire the local lighthouse from the government, the state of emergency medicine on the isolated Isle au Haut, the prospect of a turf war with mainland lobstermen, her mother's battle with cancer, friends lost at sea, her father (who serves as sternman on her lobster boat), the scarcity of eligible bachelors, her culinary ineptitude, and her dislike of dogs.<br />THE LOBSTER CHRONICLES is a pleasant but lesser sequel to THE HUNGRY OCEAN. Linda's self-effacing humor is perhaps the volume's major strong point, as well as the book's charm as a description of contemporary Americana. Some of Linda's prose is striking, as her description of the waves parading north as seen from the window of her home:<br />&quot;Some of the officers on horseback nodded shocks of white hair while masses of lower-rank sailors kept eyes forward and sternly marched in the most rehearsed fashion to the wind ... The trees lining the shore waved like spectators ...&quot;<br />By the book's end, I was saddened by Linda's undertone of unhappiness. She doesn't seem to like lobstering much. And she's fretful of the fact that, at 40, she remains unmarried and without children. Her loneliness is uncomfortably evident. (&quot;I have spent much time waiting for Mr. Right, who does not appear to be looking for me.&quot;)<br />Sail on Linda, and persevere. I wish you well.evident.

I'm attracted to Lee Child's novels because of the hardboiled and self-contained nature of his hero, Jack Reacher. After almost two decades as a military cop in the U.S. Army, Jack now wanders the U.S. with only the clothes on his back - no car, no charge cards - and a penchant for crossing paths with assorted villains. Very soon, the reader begins to feel sorry for the Bad Guys.<br /><br />Reacher is so unpolished that one sometimes wonders how he reached officer grade O-4 (Major), which would imply managing a wardrobe, knotting a tie, and displaying minimal social skills in the officers' mess and at the CO's annual Christmas party. It's not that Jack is a Neanderthal; he just doesn't care to run with the rest of the lemmings anymore.<br /><br />In WITHOUT FAIL, M.E. Froelich, who heads the Secret Service protection detail for the newly elected Vice President, Brook Armstrong, hires Reacher to audit the security of the new Veep's protective screen. Froelich is also the ex-girlfriend of Jack's dead brother. After finding holes through which a potential assassin could drive a monster SUV, Reacher learns why the Service really wants his help. The VP is receiving credible death threats. And it may be an inside job.<br /><br />I would've awarded WITHOUT FAIL at least one more star had it not been a Jack Reacher adventure. But it is, and here our prickly protagonist has to play well with others: Froelich, her boss Stuyvesant, FBI guy Bannon, and a colleague from Reacher's old Army days, ex-Sergeant Frances Neagley. Reacher's talent for punitive violence is severely curtailed compared to past episodes, revealing itself only at the very beginning and the very end. In between, Jack is reduced to being a consultant, even to the point of wearing a suit. Say it ain't so, Lee!<br /><br />The most interesting character is Neagley, now employed by a civilian security firm. She's ostensibly more deadly at physical combat than Reacher himself, and he admits to being afraid of her skills. So, the reader waits, hoping she'll unleash some mayhem. In the meantime, we learn that Frances, while being a little in love with her old military boss, has a severe dislike of being touched due to some unspecified trauma in her past. Unfortunately, Neagley remains mostly a cipher, and the entertainment value of her character is left pretty much unexploited. Perhaps she'll appear in a future Reacher novel. Better still, the author should give her a series of her own.<br /><br />I hope the next Reacher thriller is JACK IS BACK. With a vengeance.ing she'll unleash some mayhem.

SALT: A WORLD HISTORY simply reinforces the fact that NaCl has been in the human diet for millennia. So, get off my back already. If God hadn't wanted me to eat the stuff, he wouldn't have given me kidneys.<br />Besides being a narrative of how salt has been harvested through the ages, either by brine evaporation or the mining of rock salt, SALT is also a history of its link to food preservation and preparation and governments. Whether it be cod, cheese, herring, ham, beef, anchovies, butter, Tabasco sauce, sauerkraut, pickles, ketchup, or &quot;1000-year-old&quot; eggs, salt makes it happen. And successive bureaucracies over the centuries have harnessed the production, sale and shipment of salt for the enrichment of national coffers through monopolies and taxation schemes, some of them disastrously misguided. Perhaps most illustrative of the latter is the chapter describing Britain's curtailment of indigenous salt production in India during the Raj period. This imperial policy, designed to protect the domestic English salt industry, was of such detriment to large segments of the Indian population that it was the issue that sparked Gandhi's campaign of civil disobedience, ultimately leading to that colony's independence.<br />I would award five stars except for two statements made by author Mark Kurlansky in his chapter about salt and the American Civil War. These assertions have trivial impact on the book as a whole, but are so sloppy as to make me wonder about the accuracy of his interpretation of more relevant facts.<br />Regarding Confederate general George Pickett, who received a pouch of precious salt as a wedding gift: &quot;... (he) later reached the most northerly point of any Confederate in combat when he ... led a ruinous charge up a sloping Pennsylvania field - the climax of the Battle of Gettysburg.&quot; The author is referring, of course, to Pickett's Charge, and perhaps he was speaking figuratively. While it is fact that one of his brigades briefly breached the Union line at Bloody Angle, it was that unit's commander, Brigadier General Louis Armistead, who was mortally wounded inside the Union position and was arguably the one who led the charge. Pickett wasn't in front on that one. Also, the site of that valiant effort was south of the town of Gettysburg, which had been occupied by the Confederates two days previous.<br />Further on, Kurlansky trips when describing the Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee as &quot;a standoff&quot;. Really? While Federal forces under Ulysses Grant took a shellacking on the first day of the battle, they rallied on the second to drive the Confederates into a full-scale retreat from the battlefield. Moreover, Albert Sidney Johnston, who began Shiloh commanding the Confederate forces and was perhaps the South's most respected general at the time, was killed. Though casualties were roughly the same on both sides, my scorecard has this as a Northern win.<br />But, I digress.<br />SALT is one of those books about something we take for granted that captivates the reader with useless but fun facts. Did you know that pastrami (salted beef) is of Romanian origin, that Laplanders drink salted coffee, that a Swedish favorite is salted licorice candy, that 51% of U.S. salt use is to de-ice roads, or that there's a working salt mine 1,200 feet below Detroit?<br />Curiously, though, Kurlansky says not one word about that most mystical of culinary inventions, salt on french fries - uh, sorry, &quot;freedom&quot; fries.

Such is one of the fascinating factoids found in LAMB, the story of Christ's life as told by his life-long best bud Biff, otherwise known as Levi, son of Alphaeus and Naomi of Nazareth.<br />Biff, so nick-named for the daily slaps upside his head he required as a child, is raised from the dead in the twentieth century to write another gospel. As the millenium approaches, the Son of God is unhappy with the versions written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and wants a re-write. So, Biff is held a virtual prisoner by his minder, the angel Raziel, in the St. Louis Hyatt Regency until the manuscript is finished.<br />After a few introductory scenes in which a young Joshua (aka Jesus) restores life to dead lizards, has mixed luck with deceased humans, and becomes infatuated with a budding Mary Magdalene (\\"Maggie\\"), Biff's story hits its stride after Joshua, at about thirteen, debates the Pharisees in the Temple of Jerusalem. Then, our two heroes set out for the Far East in search of the Three Wise Men (Balthasar, Gaspar, Melchior) that attended Joshua's birth. From them, in Afghanistan, China, and India, Joshua learns the wisdom of the Eastern religions in preparation for his own ministry. Since Joshua is forbidden by his Heavenly Father from \\"knowing\\" women in the biblical sense, he relies on Biff to apprise him of the experience. And Biff, a ladies man, is just the one to do it, especially after several years living with the Eight Chinese Concubines, who have such names as Tiny Feet of the Divine Dance of Joyous Orgasm, Silken Pillows of the Heavenly Softness of Clouds, Pea Pods in Duck Sauce with Crispy Noodle, and Sue (short for Susanna).<br />After seventeen years of wandering and adventure, Biff and Joshua return to Galilee, where the latter gathers his apostles and disciples and begins the ministry familiar to readers of the traditional gospels. Of course, there are embellishments. Biff's narrative ends on the evening of the Friday of Joshua's crucifixion.<br />LAMB is inspired humor. It's also irreverant, but not maliciously so. The book is author Chris Moore's attempt to flesh out the story of Jesus (Joshua) - to give him a more endearingly human side. For example, when Joshua transforms water into wine at the wedding feast at Cana, he samples his miracle perhaps a little too much. And, when his disciples are astounded when he walks on the surface of the Sea of Galilee, Joshua says:<br />\\"I just ate. You can't go into the water for an hour after you eat. You could get a cramp. What, none of you guys have mothers?\\"<br />As one born and raised Catholic (and since \\"fallen away\\"), I immensely enjoyed the flippancy of LAMB. Sister Mary's grade school catechism class was never so much fun. While a Christian of a more fundamentalist belief might find LAMB faintly blasphemous, I would hope not. I trust even JC could laugh at a good dirty joke as he sat around the village well with the boys.e traditional gospels. Of course, there are embellishments.

Ol' Dad has never been close to Ray or his younger brother, Forrest. Both call him \\"Judge\\". On arrival back at the decaying, family mansion, Ray finds the old man peacefully dead on a sofa. In obvious view is a recently written will naming Ray the estate executor. Both sons are to split the estate's assets even-steven. There isn't much, though, beyond the house and $6,000 in the bank. Mississippi doesn't pay its judges much, and Judge Atlee was famously generous to any and all charities and good causes.<br />So, how about that 3.1 million dollars - cash - stashed in a bookcase behind the sofa, huh? That'll buy a lot of Moon Pies and Yoo-hoo.<br />To call THE SUMMONS a thriller is an overstatement. The action, such as it is, proceeds at a sedate pace as Ray shuttles back and forth between Virginia, Mississippi, and New Jersey and grapples with the questions:<br />1. Where did the money come from?<br />2. Is the cash marked, or counterfeit?<br />3. Should he share it with Forrest?<br />4. Does anyone else know he has it?<br />Ray decides almost immediately not to declare the money as part the Judge's estate, or share it with his brother, a chronic substance abuser who's been in and out of rehab for twenty years. After all, Forrest would only kill himself with so much wealth, wouldn't he? The reader also learns early on that at least one other is aware of the horde when Ray receives an anonymous note cautioning him not to spend the windfall, and that the IRS is only a phone call away.<br />THE SUMMONS is basically a morality play about the consequences of banal greed. I say banal because Ray is excruciatingly ordinary, and his decisions regarding the cash stash are probably the same ones you or I would make under similar circumstances.<br />Until the last twenty pages or so, I was disinclined to award more than three stars. However, author John Grisham closes with a twist that, while not one that elicits an \\"Oh, wow!\\", at least satisfyingly makes the point that what goes around comes around and poetic justice is occasionally served (at least in fiction).last twenty pages or so, I was disinclined to award more than three stars.

However, a dear friend of mine, who idolizes Anne Rice and has a warm and fuzzy preoccupation with vampires, sent me this book trusting that our friendship would compel me to read it. Yeah, well, I'm a soft touch - but just this once, mind you.<br />The protagonist of this dark fantasy is the Vampire Lestat, a recurring figure in Rice's series \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\". To make a 435-page epic short, Lestat wants to be mortal again after centuries of being Undead. The old adage is \\"Be careful what you wish for.\\" It's not surprising, then, that Lestat soon regrets a too hasty career move that he's talked into making by the Body Thief. And, in a subplot, his life is complicated by a relationship with a nun that would likely cause the Pope to issue an edict or two. As the frenetic storyline unfolds, Lestat is helped out of a desperate situation by his long-time human friend, David Talbot, the Superior General of the Talamasca, a semi-secret order of scholars dedicated to the study of the occult. (And what good pot-boiler doesn't benefit from an inscrutable organization?) In any case, after a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth, our anti-hero discovers perhaps a universal truth - that a man's and vampire's best friend is a big, shaggy dog. As a general rule, I prefer cats.<br />I'll never be one to appreciate blood-sucking demons or Anne Rice. Therefore, my three-star rating of THE TALE OF THE BODY THIEF is severely skewed and will undoubtedly cause fans to howl. Rice's prose is richly descriptive and a magnificent achievement. Lestat's first person testimony of his re-acquisition of human frailties was understatedly comic. (\\"But, if you eat, you know what will happen? You'll have to go back in that bathroom again ... The thought almost made me gag.\\") Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for a story that was, for me, excessively long and tortuous to the point that I just wanted to get to the end and move on. As a matter of fact, I wished Lestat would just move on. His angst and loneliness was tiresomely endless from start to finish no matter what form he took. And he's not the sort of character that inspires my sympathy or admiration - he's basically vicious, selfish and confused.

Asbury's fascinating narrative includes the dance halls, music saloons, dives, brothels, and gambling dens that infested the area, as well as the criminal gangs, hoodlums and cutthroats that preyed on the men lured there. The book's scope also encompasses the rising population of Chinese residents that coalesced into Chinatown, as well as the yellow slavery, tong wars and virulent anti-Chinese sentiments that evolved concurrently. And, since San Francisco is one of the world's greatest natural ports, the author describes the perils to both arriving and departing sailors, who were drawn to the Barbary Coast as insects to Venus Flytraps.<br />The twin pillars of the Barbary Coast were robbery and prostitution. Despite the early successes of vigilantism in ridding the burgeoning metropolis of undesirables, the fact that both thrived for so long can be attributed to the toleration and blatant corruption of the city's law enforcement officials and governing politicos. Of the two, prostitution was the foundation of the area's iniquity since, as the author is careful to point out, the Barbary Coast didn't finally die until the California Legislature passed the Red-light Abatement Act of 1914. Therefore, it's no surprise that much of the volume is dedicated to the Oldest Profession: the cribs, cow-yards, parlor houses, pimps, madames, and debasing working conditions.<br />THE BARBARY COAST comes near to being a book in the \\"couldn't put down\\" category. However, it sorely lacks the illustrations and period photographs that enhanced the Asbury's \\"prequel\\" volume, THE GANGS OF NEW YORK. Nevertheless, once read, you'll not see the modern streets of San Francisco in the same way again.OF NEW YORK.

In the latter, a skeptical writer of books about haunted places takes a room for the night in The Dolphin, a New York hotel, despite the manager's earnest attempts to dissuade him.

Carew was convicted of murder after aiding the escape of four Blacks who pitched a bomb into the Rand Supreme Court in Johannesburg. Isolated and lonely, Jeez sends a letter to his former wife back in the UK. Before he deserted her and his toddler son years before, Carew's name was Curwen.<br />Jack Curwen, 27, is a junior executive with a demolitions company. He's also Jeez's son. When he learns from his mother that Jeez is soon for South African gallows, a stubborn sense of loyalty propels him to  Her Majesty's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. FCO officially tells him there's nothing to be done. However, a sympathetic Whitehall maverick tells Jack that his father is not what he appears to be. And, for the sake of political expediency, the Government and the MI6 mandarins in Century House have decided that Jeez is expendable. Determined to do right by his Old Man, Jack gets some practical advice from a crusty old explosive expert, and flys to Johannesburg. He's going to blast Jeez out of that gaol.<br />Author Gerald Seymour's fictional worlds are comprised of moral ambiguities; right and wrong come in myriad shades of gray. Therefore, in A SONG IN THE MORNING, it's no surprise that there are \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" people on both sides of the line in apartheid South Africa, and all are doing their duty as they see it.

He was soon to be exchanged for Michael Holly, and the deal is now off.<br />Holly, an engineer for an English manufacturing company, was recruited by MI6 to deliver a clandestine package on his next business trip to Moscow. A piece of cake, according to his Secret Intelligence Service recruiter. But Holly was caught and convicted of espionage. Now, the swap for Demyonov off, Holly is sent to a Correctional Labor Colony in the heart of the USSR for 14 years. Because Holly was born Mikhail Holovich of Russian parents who'd escaped to Britain after WWII, he's classed as a Russian - a traitor - for the purpose of imprisonment. It's to be Camp 3, Zone 1(Strict Regime).<br />Back in the UK, the head of MI6 charges Alan Millet, Holly's recruiter, with investigating Michael's background. Is his agent likely to crack under continued interrogation and embarrass Her Majesty's government? As Millet discovers the mettle of the man he sent into harm's way, the reader begins to feel sorry for Michael's gaolers.<br />In Camp 3, the resident Political Officer, KGB Captain Yuri Rudakov, sees Holly as a giant step up the career ladder if he can extract from the new prisoner the confession the Moscow bumblers couldn't get. In the meantime, Michael fires the first shot in his own personal war with a plastic baggie of machine oil, the page from a magazine, and some coal dust.<br />This is the best of the several Gerald Seymour thrillers I've devoured to date. The reader's sympathies are focused solely on Holly and are rarely sidetracked, though one is tempted to feel an occasional pang of compassion for Millet and (even!) Rudakov.<br />As I've stated before, the charm of Seymour's novels is that he doesn't deal in absolutes of right or wrong. His venues of conflict are patterned in shades of gray. As Holly rattles the bars of his cage, both he and the reader question the moral responsibility of his actions as the consequences for his fellow prisoners mounts. This is good stuff that transcends the bulk of the genre.<br />With delicious anticipation, I contemplate the seven other Seymour books lined up on my shelf to be read.cage, both he and the reader question the moral responsibility of his actions as the consequences for his fellow prisoners mounts.

A constant thread is the state of the country and its inhabitants, individually and collectively, post-Tiananmen Square.<br />Then it's on to Cambodia, a country yet to recover from the cruel self-immolation imposed by Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge minions. As Jensen writes about this \\"biblical Judgement Day\\":<br />\\"... when the gates of Paradise were opened, it was only to reveal yet another graveyard. ... It was the humbled, the abased and the desperate who were raised on high, not to put an end to despair, but to extend it to everyone.\\"<br />And lastly, Vietnam, with which the author is obviously entranced, and the reader with him. Much of Carsten's enthrallment is with the country's women - Tam, Kim and Scent of Spring in particular. It's with the first that he has a physical relationship. And it's Tam who states in the most eloquent manner I've ever encountered the worst thing about not being able to conceive a child:<br />\\"You can't pass on the eyes of the one you love to posterity. Like the stars they will be put out, instead of living on in a new face.\\"<br />Whether Jensen is describing China's Tiger Leap Gorge, Shanghai's New Year fireworks celebration, Cambodia's Angkor Wat, Phnom Penh's horrific Security Prison 21, Vietnam's Hanoi (\\"like a wood with streets\\"), the royal tombs at Hue, or Dien Bien Phu, the graveyard of French colonialism in Southeast Asia, his magnificent prose transports you there.<br />I was tempted to award I HAVE SEEN THE WORLD BEGIN five stars, but am prevented from doing so by what I consider to be a significant omission.

She's a soul mate. In BLOOMING, penned in the late 70s, Ms. Toth shares coming-of-age memories as delightful as those from another of my favorite authors, Laura Shaine Cunningham ([[ASIN:B000GG4J3C Sleeping Arrangements]], A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY).<br /><br />Susan was born in 1940, and BLOOMING is her account of life in Ames, Iowa until she went East to college in 1957. The ability to relate will increase to the degree that the reader's background shares commonality with the following: maturing in the late 40s and 50s, living in a Midwest plains state, being female. I can only claim identity with the first, but that limited coincidence didn't affect my ability to thoroughly enjoy this volume.<br /><br />Toth's remarkable memory of her childhood and teenage years could serve as the source for Norman Rockwell paintings as she remembers swimming pools, boyfriends, girlfriends, science classes, the public library, parties, summer jobs, the traditional holidays, and yearly trips to the Minnesota lake where relatives owned a cabin. She was unusually reticent about her immediate family. We learn only that her father died when she was in the third grade, and she and her sister were raised by their mother, a teacher. This absence of familial information is somewhat disappointing as it's perhaps a gold mine of stories not told. For instance, Susan writes about her sister, one year older:<br /><br />\\"My sister and I, who fought most of the time, declared an unspoken truce on Christmas morning and hugged awkwardly as we exchanged gifts. For those brief moments, we really wanted to please each other.\\" So, what did they fight over? Boys? Clothes? Maternal attention?<br /><br />The realist might point out that most of the world's children, and many in America, didn't live formative years as idyllic as depicted in BLOOMING. True enough. But I lived the male version in Southern California, and Toth's was sufficiently similar in rhythm to remind me of those Good Ol' Days when I didn't know how good I had it.

It begins in 1947 with the birth of a son, Ned, to Sam and Jenny Hall. However, Sam soon does what he does best, which is walk away, i.e. from his family responsibilities. Ned's memory and relationship with his Dad really begins at age 6, when Sam abruptly appears and takes Ned on an unauthorized fishing trip. Returning his son to Jenny disheveled, grubby and afflicted with poison ivy, Mom empties her father's old service revolver into Sam's car. Sam then makes himself scarce again until Ned is age 12, at which time Jenny has a nervous breakdown that lands her in an institution for two years, during which time the boy lives with Dad in a converted office above a department store in deteriorating downtown Mohawk. After Jenny is released back to the world, Ned again resides with her until he goes off to college in Tucson. At age 24, he returns to Mohawk for a period, dividing his time between both parents. Finally, he returns to Mohawk at age 34 from his home in Manhattan. By then, Ned's mother has remarried and moved to California, and the Old Man is dying.<br />THE RISK POOL is narrated in the first person by Ned, and is divided into four unequal parts corresponding to Ned's maternal grandfather's description of Mohawk's four seasons: Fourth of July, Mohawk Fair, Eat the Bird, and Winter. It's not so much the story of Ned as that of his wary relationship with his irresponsible father, who works at road construction in the summer and spends the winter and his earnings on horse racing, billiards and booze. Indeed, Ned is nicknamed \\"Sam's Kid\\" by his Dad's friends and hangers-on. Jenny is rarely acknowledged. Sam has only two good qualities: he loves his son (in his own peculiar way), and he's generous to a fault with money (when he has any).<br />Author Richard Russo's mastery of dialogue and descriptive detail is evident. But, for me, it was a dispassionate read. The characters are only marginally interesting at best, and I never liked (or disliked) any of them. Russo's prose imbues Ned with something akin to listlessness. He always seems mired in ennui, yet lacks the energy to do anything about it. Even his first love affair is remarkably lacking in passion. Like his father, Ned takes the path of least resistance. By the time I was two-thirds through this 478 page paperback, I was feeling ennui myself. I prodded myself to finish, hoping for an ending that was clever, or at least one that left me admiring Ned more. It never happened.<br />Since THE RISK POOL is technically well done, and realizing that my disenchantment with it is oh so subjective, I'm giving it a marginal thumbs up, i.e. three stars. This is compared to a much better coming-of-age story such as John Grisham's A PAINTED HOUSE, which had characters so engaging that it begs for a sequel. If THE RISK POOL has a sequel, I won't bother.ly marginally interesting at best, and I never liked (or disliked) any of them. Russo's prose imbues Ned with something akin to listlessness.

In the latter, the Iranians send their master assassin onto English soil to do a wet job. On his trail are representatives from a ragtag bunch of British security and law enforcement agencies, plus an expert Scottish tracker and his dogs. In CONDITION BLACK, the villain is a young English mercenary in Iraq's employ, Colt. He's already killed an Iraqi dissident and his CIA contact in Athens. Now, he's going back to his island home to do another hit - and visit his dying Mum.<br />There's the usual posse of pursuers and kibitzers: MI6, MI5, Scotland Yard, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mossad. Chief among them is FBI agent Bill Erlich, out to avenge the murder of his good friend, the CIA agent in Athens. Erlich is young and ambitious. He sees a successful outcome to the chase as a step up the rung of the advancement ladder. To his principle British minder, James Rutherford of MI5, Erlich is \\"Buffalo Bill\\", a cowboy with a quick draw mentality.<br />What could be a simple storyline is made more complex by another task assigned Colt by his Iraqi handlers once he's on home soil. By the way, Colt, how about stopping by Her Majesty's Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston and recruit one of it's scientists to turn traitor and work for the Iraqi nuclear weapons program? Why sure, chief, no problem.<br />Gerald Seymour is my very favorite creator of spy/conspiracy potboilers. However, I can't quite award five stars for CONDITION BLACK. It seemed the author was overreaching when he assigned two very different roles to Colt. Though not impossible - and what do I know? - it would seem more plausible that assassination and agent recruitment are two very disparate talents not likely resident in a single operative, much less one as unsophisticated as Colt. And the ending was vaguely unsatisfying, though it was consistent with Seymour's first class strength, which is crafting his plots consistent with grubby, unheroic real life, in which the winners and losers are rarely clear cut.though it was consistent with Seymour's first class strength, which is crafting his plots consistent with grubby, unheroic real life, in which the winners and losers are rarely clear cut.	2003-01-16

It's Eric Schlosser's detailed and eminently readable portrait of the American fast food industry: its founders (most notably Ray Kroc and Carl Karcher), its Southern California evolution, marketing strategy (especially as it targets kids), corporate alliances (e.g. McDonald's with Disney Corporation), hiring and employment practices, franchising structure, food product design, flavor and color additives, food growers and processors, meat packers, food contamination, job-related injuries, union relations, regulatory agencies, and overseas operations. Everything you're drooling to know - and then some. It sounds dry, but isn't.<br />Did you know that Ray Kroc was so fastidious that he cleaned the holes in his mop wringer with a toothbrush? That the \\"smell\\" of strawberry results from the interaction of at least 350 different chemicals? That perfectly sliced french fries are formed by shooting the skinned spud from a high pressure water hose at 117 feet per second through a grid of blades? That none of the workers in McDonald's roughly 15,000 North American stores is represented by a union? Or that every day in the U.S. roughly 200,000 people are sickened by a foodborne disease, of which 900 are hospitalized and 14 die?<br />The dominant tone of Schlosser's narrative ranges from neutral to strongly censuring. By my count, only thrice did he write something clearly positive about a fast food giant: the good wages paid by the In 'n' Out chain, the improvements in beef procurement by Jack In the Box following a 1993 outbreak of E. coli contamination at several of its outlets, and the current effort by McDonald's to clean up its meat suppliers' acts following some very bad lawsuit-generated PR. (Of course, the cynic will say it's only self-serving damage control.) So, either the industry is truly in need of reform, or the author is a closet anti-Big Business activist. You must decide for yourself. In any case, FAST FOOD NATION didn't turn me against fast food. Why, right now I'm endeavoring to keep the \\"secret sauce\\" from dripping onto my keyboard, and I can hardly see the screen for the smears of fried chicken grease.st. You must decide for yourself.

Briefly summarized, the \\"Collaborate\\" is a global consortium of financial and scientific corporations backing a plan for advanced gene therapy based on a technology that can introduce whole chromosomes into the developing human fetus in order to correct genetic abnormalities. The chief protagonist of the story, Dr. Kevin Kincaid, is the brilliant physician-researcher employed by a Collaborate health care and research entity, the Benjamin Franklin Healthcare Network (BFHN), to create and perfect the protein vector, HACV.V7 that inserts the new genetic material into the targeted germ cells. Fearing monopolistic abuse of the technology, two organizations oppose Collaborate and seek to acquire V7's design: the Defense Advanced Research Progects Agency (DARPA - a very real government body) and the Anti-Genetic Action Committee (AntiGen).<br />GERMLINE's premise is intriguing, the action is occasionally exciting, and the dialog is well done for a \\"debut novel\\". However, the book has several rough edges that allow me to award only 3 stars.<br />There's an excess of characters that significantly impact the storyline: Kincaid, Frederick Grayson (the head of BFHN), Eric Bertram (Chairman of Collaborate), Dixon Loring (Bertram's megalomaniacal deputy), Trent McGovern (head of AntiGen), Kristin Brocks (DARPA's security chief), Helen/Tracy Bergmann (of AntiGen), Dr. Roderick Stevenson (Chief Pathologist at the Collaborate's isolated research complex, Delphi), Marguerite Moraes (at Delphi), and Blount (a Collaborate thug). By my count, four or five of these players could have been left on the cutting room floor, thus streamlining an already complex plot.<br />Background information provides depth and realism to fiction. As an award-winning researcher and ex-surgeon, Dr. Erlick is well positioned to provide such. However, perhaps he went over the top. For example, when referring to the neurotransmitter glutamate, a character mentions APMA-kinate receptors, voltage-independent synaptic responses, voltage-dependent NMDA-receptors, and metabotropic-subtype receptors. Or, regarding certain custom-created genes:<br />\\"We back-coded for the genes ... (placing) them with gene regulators on the q arm of our designer chromosome, position 23q11 through 23q14 ...\\"<br />Such esoterica could be understood, I'm sure, by workers in the field. But I gather that Erlick desires a wider readership; your average reader's eyes may glaze over.<br />I personally was totally unsympathetic towards the \\"hero\\" of the story, Kincaid. Sure, at the very beginning his wife and two children are murdered. However, the author never established for the reader a close relationship between the four, so it was hard to care. Kevin was simply the brilliant physician robot wound up and sent on his way to engage the Bad Guys. And Kevin's relationship with Helen/Tracy was forced all the way to the end.<br />Lastly, I suspect that GERMLINE's specter of gene therapy going awry is the author's personal apprehension. Unfortunately, sinister global conspiracies in fiction are tricky constructs. They're only sinister if the general consensus holds them to be so, like the nuclear Armageddon brought on by KGB plotters so popular in Cold War potboilers. In GERMLINE's case, the maleficence of the conspiracy is perhaps subjective and not to be shared by all.<br />I think additional editing could lift this thriller to the 4-star level, and I believe Erlick has a viable career as a fiction writer ahead of him if he elects to pursue it.<br />(Note: This review is of an advance uncorrected proof in the publisher's binding sent to me by the author, who has since informed me that the book has undergone some editing.)the top.

One of Franca's group, Giancarlo, is a 19 year-old novice. He's also Franca's current sexual toy-boy, one in a long succession that she casually uses and discards. But Giancarlo,  silly lad, is besotted. So, when Franca is captured by the state's antiterrorist unit, Giancarlo hatches a plot to single-handedly free the woman that deflowered him and win her undying love; he'll snatch Harrison from the kidnappers and exchange him for Franca, or execute him.<br />Rather than creating fictional superheroes, Seymour conjures ordinary folks playing life-or-death roles in larger conflicts. His novels' characters are eminently believable, and this, for me, is the author's chief appeal. (And which is why I have a half-dozen of his books lined up on the shelf to read.) RED FOX is no different in this regard. My only quarrel with this storyline is that the reader's sympathetic support is too fragmented between several protagonists. Should one cheer on the truly hapless Harrison, or Giuseppi Carboni, the Roman cop on the original kidnapping case, or Francesco Vellosi, the powerful head of the government's Public Security agency, or Archie Carpenter, a Scotland Yard inspector now working security for ICH, who's dispatched to Rome to liaison with the locals? It certainly isn't Violet Harrison, Geoffrey's spouse, who has a lot in common with Franca.<br />Seymour once again gets into the minds of his finely crafted characters as the action and tension narrow down to a stiletto point.

However, I thoroughly enjoyed the author's two previous volumes of memoirs, SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS and A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY, and we've exchanged emails of mutual admiration, so I bit down on my emery board and got on with it. Just between you and me, I'm glad I did. But I'm left wondering if I need testosterone replacement therapy.<br />The plot tells you right off that it's not a book for Real Men. Six female pals in their mid-30s living in New York gather at a private dinner party at the apartment of one to have a baby shower for another. Baby shower? Yikes!<br />Jessie, the hostess, is a successful journalist still in the post-coital afterglow of an affair out in Colorado with one of her subjects. Nina, a chronic dieter and the primary caregiver for her dying mother, owns a nail salon. Nina is also fresh off an afternoon tryst with someone she met in her apartment building's laundry room, a New Age Sensitive Fella who invited her up for herbal tea (\\"Celestial Seasonings\\"). Sue Carol, a waitress and struggling thespian with a substance abuse problem, has just left her adulterous husband. Sue Carol savors all the little dramas in her life - they'll make her a better actress. Lisbeth, an ethereal, anorexic artist/model pining after a lost (and married) lover, spends a significant portion of her energy staving off her landlord's efforts to evict her from her rent-controlled apartment. Martha, a real estate agent obsessed with her exorbitant earnings and the material goodies they buy, has meticulously planned to have a child with her fiance, but has just learned that she's sterile. And lastly, Claire, the mother-to-be. Claire is an independent, free-spirited musician - she plays the krummhorn - who's happily made a world for herself in an 18 by 20 foot room in a local residence for women. She's blissfully happy with her pregnancy and the prospect of being a single mother. The baby's father, a global wanderer, may never be seen again.<br />For me, the chief fascination of BEAUTIFUL BODIES was in watching the nuances and shifting dynamics of the relationships between the six women as they come together on a winter night to celebrate Claire's impending motherhood and share secrets. For example, Nina is the first to show up at Jessie's apartment. Later, Lisbeth is the second guest to arrive, and:<br />\\"When a third woman enters the room, it is clear which two women are the closer friends. Triangles always come to a point.\\"<br />And still later, as the assembled group sits for dinner:<br />\\"The others had taken their places, as the (place) cards indicated .... The lines were drawn.

I'm a map junkie, especially national highway and city street maps. Perhaps it's the lure of the open road and exotic places. In any case, I recently acquired the LONDON A-Z street atlas, and I'm in seventh heaven. London, you see, is my favorite city in the whole world.<br />The atlas covers the city center plus outlying suburbs from Romford and Sidcup in the east to Ruislip and Shepperton in the west, and Barnet and Enfield in the north to Sutton and Croyden in the south. Claiming to index over 69,000 streets, each of its 170 color map pages is, well, busy. Since the atlas is only 7.5 by 5 inches, the street names are printed small and require either the good vision of youth or the spectacles of old age. And a magnifying glass helps.<br />There are several other useful features: a single page map each for the West End cinemas and theatres, a map-referenced listing of hospitals and hospices, a map-referenced listing of all rail, Tramlink and Underground stations, a schematic of Greater London's rail connecting points with the Underground, and the world famous color schematic of the latter. This is good stuff.<br />Of course, there are symbols on each map for the usual clutter of police stations, post offices, information centers, fire stations, churches and chapels, shopping centres and markets, public buildings, toilets for the disabled, tracks and footpaths, etc.<br />My only complaint concerns those maps other than the large-scale ones of Central London. On the former, the rail and Underground stations, those beacons of solidity in an uncertain world, aren't as immediately obvious as one might like. They're much better indicated on the Central London plans.<br />Oh, and Bleeding Heart Yard? Why, it's right there on page 161 in map square 6K. Can't miss it, guv.	2002-12-22

You see, Lt. Pounds - the consummate desk jockey - had interfered with one of Harry's interrogations, which resulted in the (probably guilty) suspect walking free. Now, Bosch is on involuntary stress leave with orders to see the department head doctor. To kill time between appointments, Harry unofficially re-opens an unsolved 30+ year-old murder case, that of his mother, a Hollywood hooker. Then there's his Hollywood Hills home, damaged by a recent earthquake and subsequently earmarked for demolition, to worry about. It makes for angst that would cause testiness even in the Pope. And, when Pounds is tortured and murdered and Lt. Brockman of Internal Affairs brings Bosch in for the third degree, our hero loses it:<br />\\"Bosch shoved the table toward Brockman ... and pinned Brockman against the wall ... as he went without air ... (Brockman's) eyes bugged.\\"<br />The fictional road to this book's conclusion is the well-travelled one through police and political chicanery, either of which I can read about in the daily newspaper if I feel the unlikely compulsion.  Rather, since each of us perhaps occasionally feels that mad urge for self destruction, the fun of THE LAST COYOTE is watching Bosch be a bull in his own china shop and then clean up the shards. Even that would earn it only four stars, in my opinion, except that the completely unexpected plot twist in the last ten pages merits it the ultimate fifth. If you're still bothering to fly the nation's unfriendly skies, or you're just stuck in a long post office que, THE LAST COYOTE is the perfect distraction to numb the experience.	2002-12-19

Books	4	8	8	N	N	What? No impalement on pungi sticks?	In the forward of EXTREME ENCOUNTERS, author Greg Emmanuel indicates that the muse for his book came knocking after his own near death experience in a rollover auto accident on a New York parkway. Happily, my second-string Review Muse doesn't need such a drastic kick start.<br />EXTREME ENCOUNTERS is all about situations and events that result in dire physical or mental injury, often ending in death. Its 40 chapters are divided into six sections: attacks by other species, outdoor misadventures, medical emergencies, crime and punishment, ordinary daily accidents, and in-harm's-way by choice. My favorite from each section was respectively: death by fire ants, abduction by tornado, death by Ebola, interrogation by \\"Chinese water torture\\", pain by hydrofluoric acid, and over Niagara Falls via barrel.<br />The author can describe these vicarious thrills after having interviewed survivors and those otherwise knowledgeable about such things. He spices each chapter with relevant facts. (Did you know that the Philippines is the only country besides the U.S. to have executed with the electric chair, or that 30,000 wounded limbs were amputated in the Union Army during the Civil War?) He brings the immediacy of the experience home to the reader by use of the second person. So, it's:<br />\\"You land face first in the shallow water, putting more of your flesh into the feeding zone.\\" (Piranha buffet)<br /><br />Or, \\"You try to angle your body so you can kick at the lid.\\" (Buried alive)<br />And, \\"Your foot kicks against the metal faucet, completing the circuit, and the current goes straight through your body.\\" (Blow dryer into the tub)<br />I'm giving EXTREME ENCOUNTERS 4 stars because of the novelty of the theme and the examples chosen to illustrate it. Otherwise, at 173 pages, it's simply a fast and absorbing read that allows one to move quickly on to the next book on the shelf.	2002-12-05

As evidenced by its 779 narrative pages and its 13 pages of sources, LONDON: THE BIOGRAPHY is a prodigious accomplishment by author and city resident Peter Ackroyd. And it did take me five weeks to read it.<br /><br />Since I'd rather be in London than anywhere else, especially the Southern California I'm in, I began this volume with giddy anticipation. In his narrative of the city from pre-Roman times to the present, Ackroyd touches on the history of many of its diverse aspects: rivers, commerce, architecture, transport, theaters, street ballads, parks, food, weather, maps, neighborhoods, nationalities, fires, fog, pestilences, the effects of the Blitz, public lighting, law enforcement, sanitation and clubs. He also doesn't neglect London's unsavory side: alcoholism, gambling, blood sports, prisons, crime, the homeless, poverty, beggars, mob violence, racism, child labor, prostitution, overcrowding, the insane, slums, air and water pollution, and general squalor and filth. Because the author seemed (to me) so preoccupied with the latter dreary group, I suspect he's a closet social reformer.<br /><br />LONDON isn't a riveting read. Surprisingly, I could put it down for such jolly pursuits as taking out the trash and cleaning the cats' litter box. Perhaps it's because the author's style, never leavened by any humor, becomes at times almost ponderous. For instance, in the chapter &#34;How Many Miles to Babylon?&#34;, he comments:<br /><br />&#34;Yet there is one more salient aspect to this continual analogy of London with ancient civilisations: it is the fear, or hope, or expectation that this great imperial capital will in its turn fall into ruin. That is precisely the reason for London's association with pre-Christian cities; it, too, will revert to chaos and old night so that the condition of the 'primeval' past will also be that of the remote future. It represents the longing for oblivion... The vision is of a city unpeopled, and therefore free to be itself; stone endures, and, in this imagined future stone becomes a kind of god. Essentially it is a vision of the city as death. But it also represents the horror of London, and of its teeming life; it is a cry against its supposed unnaturalness, which can only be repudiated by a giant act of nature such as a deluge.&#34;<br /><br />Good heavens, man! Get a grip!<br /><br />I assume that the author loves his city, or he wouldn't have expended such enormous effort to tell its story. However, his affection is ofttimes difficult to infer, as when he writes:<br /><br />&#34;This is the horror of the city. It is blind to human need and human affection, its topography cruel and almost mindless in its brutality... The image is of a labyrinth which is constantly expanding, reaching outwards towards infinity. On the maps of England it is seen as a dark patch, or stain, spreading slowly but inexorably outwards.&#34;<br /><br />LONDON provides a magnificent tapestry of information, and is a colossal achievement. However, until the last twenty-five or so pages, the author failed both to convince me that he derived any personal joy from residence in the city or to remind me why I love this place so much. Ackroyd's references to a city brutalizing, oppressing and dehumanizing its inhabitants are numerous to the point of being tiresome. Therefore, I finished the book admiring it much more than feeling good about it. Indeed, it wasn't until page 772 that I came across a statement (by Boswell) that struck a very personal emotional chord:<br /><br />&#34;I was full of rich imagination of London ... such as I could not explain to most people, but which I strongly feel and am ravished with.

Albany is one of the richest aristocrats in England, and also a dissolute, selfish, old fool. Along for the ride are his wife Constance, six of their fourteen spoiled children, fifteen of nineteen servants, an aging parrot named Prince Talleyrand, the staghound Tintamarre, and a gaggle of American talent hired to ease their way, including Toussaint Charbonneau, the guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition many years previous.<br />The first noticeable feature of SIN KILLER, the start of a four-book series, is the lengthy cast of players requiring a two-page character list. In addition to all those on the boat, there's a couple dozen ashore - Indians, trappers, and such - to provide local color. Chief among these is the SIN KILLER, a young trapper named Jim Snow, who has an exaggerated sense of God-fearing righteousness and an awkward way with women.<br />Since McMurtry's tales of the Old West are, for its characters, affairs perilous to life and limb, I immediately expected some of the English crowd to soon become victims of misadventure. (After all, such a large number is a heavy load to carry.) I wasn't disappointed.<br />It's apparent early on that the main protagonist of the book, and I suspect the series, is Tasmine, Lord Berrybender's independent and willful oldest daughter. Nothing scares her, not even her Old Man. And I expect the villain of the piece, the cruel, old Aleut-Russian squaw Draga, who passes herself off as a sorceress, won't scare Tasmine either if and when their paths cross. (Draga is a psycho in the grand tradition of other McMurtry psychos such as Blue Duck and Mox Mox. Remember them?)<br />Judging from this first installment, there are a couple of reasons I don't think the Berrybender saga will be the author's best work. First of all, crucial events happen relatively quickly without too much plot or character development. Perhaps, as McMurtry gets older, he's driven to get it written and published faster. (You never know when you're going to be ambushed and scalped by savages.) Secondly, a lot of the action and dialogue has a slapstick quality about it that seems forced. However, at 300 pages, SIN KILLER is a quick, engaging read.<br />I loved McMurtry's LONESOME DOVE trilogy. (The 1989 miniseries adaptation of that title starring Robert Duvall is my favorite western of all time.) While perhaps not presaging such excellence, this first volume of the Berrybender epic left me looking forward to the next. Oh, and I hope Prince Talleyrand continues to survive.

I finished it in less than two days.<br />In the First Forward, Stephen King observes that popular novelists are never \\"asked about the language\\" when queried by admiring fans. Thus, he states:<br />\\"What follows is an attempt to put down , briefly and simply, how I came to the craft (of telling stories on paper), what I know about it now, and how it's done. It's about the day job; it's about the language.\\"<br />In the first hundred or so pages, King shares his experiences growing up in Maine and Connecticut, his marriage, his struggles as a novice writer, and his drug and alcohol problems. King intends this section not as an autobiography, but as a curriculum vitae. It ends with the assignment of the paperback rights to CARRIE, his first novel.<br />In the next 150 pages, the author describes how he performs his craft. He explains the \\"tools\\" of writing (vocabulary and grammar), the creative environment (the room, the door, the determination to close the door, and the music - Hard Rock in King's case), style and formatting (paragraphing, narration, description, and dialogue), and the final stretch to a finished piece (drafts, editing, and proofreading by a trusted friend - wife/author Tabitha in King's case).<br />The final few pages, in a way, are the most interesting. It's Stephen's account of the road accident in 1999 that inflicted multiple fractures to his ribs and lower body, and the effect the mishap had on his writing. Ironically enough, he'd half completed this book at the time of the incident, and he had to struggle to come back and finish.<br />Though King was once a high school English teacher, ON WRITING is in no way pedantic, but chatty and informal. It's a book straight from the author's heart, and it shows.<br />\\"Don't wait for the muse ... This isn't the Ouija board or the spirit-world we're talking about here, but just another job like laying pipe or driving long-haul trucks. Your job is to make sure the muse knows where you're going to be every day from nine 'til noon or seven 'til three. If he does know, I assure you that sooner or later he'll start showing up, chomping his cigar and making his magic.\\"<br />The author's first rule for good writing is that the writer must read a lot. Well, I do that - constantly. Perhaps I can improve my own poor scribbling. In this review, I've followed his advice; I've kept the paragraphs short and avoided use of passive sentence construction. That's something, at least.job is to make sure the muse knows where you're going to be every day from nine 'til noon or seven 'til three.

Like A MAIDEN'S GRAVE, another hostage thriller I recently devoured, this novel is everything a trashy, can't-put-down potboiler should be.<br />Denny, recently released from a correctional facility, robs a Southern California suburban convenience store with his whiny brother, Kevin, and an inscrutable new buddy, Mars. The cashier is killed, and Mars smiles watching him die. Making their getaway, the transmission of the trio's pick-up fails. So, it's out of the truck, over a wall, and into the home of an accountant, where the boys take hostages: the owner, Walter Smith, and his two children, 16-year old Jennifer and 10-year old Thomas. Soon the place is surrounded by the local, bedroom community cops headed by Chief Jeff Talley, a mentally scarred former hostage negotiator for the LAPD, who quit that gig because of burnout and a hostage crisis that went bad. Soon the Highway Patrol and the county sheriff's SWAT team join the fun.<br />What the police and the Bad Guys don't realize is that Walter isn't just any accountant. He's the personal bean counter for Sonny Benza, head of the Mob's regional operations. It's tax time, and Walter has possession of the books for both Sonny's legal and illegal businesses, each on a computer zip disk. Through them, a link could be made back to the Big Boss on the East Coast. After Walter suffers a severe head injury, the disks are unprotected. (Oh, and did I mention that army of troopers itching to storm the house?) Ain't nobody happy about this one. Except maybe Denny, who's wondering how to spend the oodles of bundled C-notes he's found in a secret closet - if he can just get away with the swag.<br />Enormous pressure envelops everybody in this cooker as each side - hostage takers, police, Mafia kingpins - focuses on its own agenda. Jennifer and Thomas are good, particularly the latter, as potential loose cannons. And you'll be wondering just how disgustingly violent the storyline's two psychos, the creepy Mars and Marion Clewes, will prove to be. Marion is the Wet Work Specialist brought in by Sonny's damage control team to force safe recovery of the two zips, and he knows where to find Talley's wife and daughter.<br />Author Robert Crais filled HOSTAGE with distinct and interesting characters, and he maintained the knuckle-biting tension throughout a reasonably plausible plot. This is a First Class read that I unreservedly recommend.tingly violent the storyline's two psychos, the creepy Mars and Marion Clewes, will prove to be.

LONDON, of the City Secrets series of travel guides, is a little gem that will easily fit into a pocket of your travel vest as you set out to explore what is arguably the world's greatest city.<br />This volume, small in size but rich in information, divides Britain's capital into thirteen areas according to a scheme that escapes me. However, no matter. Each area, e.g. Hyde Park & Chelsea, The City, Oxford Street & Mayfair, or The East End & Beyond, is preceded by a map on which is marked each point of interest included in that section. And what you will find are both famous and little-known museums, historic buildings, art galleries, libraries, shops, pubs, churches, eateries, parks, squares, streets, memorials, and gardens. Each includes, at least, an address or location and the name of the nearest Underground or rail station. If relevant, there's also a phone number and/or the date the place was founded or constructed. The core of each listing is a short descriptive commentary by a contributing journalist, architect, philosopher, playwright, professor, author, historian, poet, curator, or some other professional of similar dignity. At the end of the book are an Index of Recommended Reading and an Index of Contributors. What you won't find are budget hotels, American fast-food franchises, newsagents, or 24-hour chemists (pharmacies) reviewed by backpacking college students, traveling salesmen, lorry drivers, or tourists from the Midwest. This is a genteel publication.<br />LONDON is a delightful and uncommonly intelligent sightseeing resource for those of us who've been to the city often enough to have exhausted the usual tourist activities and are left with making silly faces at the Buckingham Palace guard to try and crack his reserve. And besides the information that might be considered usual for each of the listings, the contributors also provide tidbits of arcane information that the casual visitor would likely not know or learn, as in the following example.<br />Regarding Oxford Street: \\"Plans drawn up in 1972 to transform Oxford Street into 'a tree-lined paradise' must have fallen down the back of somebody's sofa, because the busiest street in Britain can still ... make you lose the will to live - mainly at Christmas, when bright-eyed shoppers ... spill out of the ground at Oxford Circus and congeal in a fog of bus fumes and freshly roasted caramel nuts ...

I thought, wow, this could be another riveting book like 1994's HOT ZONE, which was inspired by the Ebola virus.  However, in its middle chapters, FLU drifted off course to a discussion of other flu scares of the late 20th century, specifically the Swine Flu fiasco of 1976 and the Hong Kong Flu panic of 1977. In retrospect, neither was relevant to the deadly 1918 virus except to illustrate the epidemiologists' fixation with influenza as a potentially catastrophic killer. Thus, the book should perhaps have been titled FLU: THE BOGEY MAN UNDERNEATH EPIDEMIOLOGISTS' BEDS.  Moreover, though author Gina Kolata did return to the \\"search for\\" subtheme, even that fizzled by the end. The hunt for the 1918 virus, and a delineation of what made it so uniquely vicious, remains a story whose ending remains to be written.  The HIV virus has replaced the influenza virus as the focus of the scientific community's investigative efforts.<br />There was one aspect of FLU that I did find notable, and that was a hint of gender bias on the part of the author towards the book's three principal \\"heroes\\": Dr. Johan Hultin, Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger, and Dr. Kirsty Duncan. All three attempted to recover the 1918 virus from the lung tissue of victims that died from the disease. Hultin, a San Francisco pathologist, went looking for corpses of Eskimos buried in the Alaskan permafrost. Duncan, a geographer by profession, organized the exhumation of dead miners buried at Spitzbergen, Norway. Taubenberger, an MD/PhD researcher with the U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, went rummaging among tissue samples preserved in paraffin blocks stored for decades at the institute. Kolata admiringly described the professional pedigrees and accomplishments of both Hultin and Taubenberger, but virtually ignored Duncan, except to infer that her \\"long hair and doe eyes and raw emotions\\" may have had an unsettling effect on the marriage of one of her team members. Oh, and that Duncan's own marriage broke up. (Was this relevant? Who cares?) Moreover, images of Hultin and Taubenberger hard at work are featured in the volume's too paltry section of photographs, but not Duncan. And, in the \\"Acknowledgements\\", the author thanks Hultin and Taubenberger for their \\"extraordinary assistance\\", but no gratitude, however lukewarm, is awarded Duncan. Do I perceive some cattiness here? Meow!<br />I found FLU marginally interesting, but it in no way met expectations.

His mother having died shortly before his fourth birthday, Libby was raised on his father's Colorado ranch with an older brother. Fred became a &quot;cowboy&quot; in the most authentic sense of the word, working on his family's ranch as well as others in the Southwest. Training wild horses to become cow ponies was his much sought after specialty. Then, tiring of hard life on the range at age twenty, he has the vague notion of settling in a warm and more lazy environment, such as Tahiti. However, he gets sidetracked to Canada where, at the outbreak of World War I, he's seduced into enlisting into a motor transport unit of the Canadian Army with the promise of travel and regular pay. By the end of 1917, Libby is a commissioned officer in Britain's Royal Flying Corps, having logged more than 350 hours of combat flight time over the trenches of the Western Front, and with 24 confirmed downed enemy planes to his credit.<br />The book contains no indication when Libby penned his memoirs. The style indicates somewhat of a detached perspective, which is perhaps evidence that the author wrote many years after the fact when memory had smoothed over the emotional highs and lows of his early years. But, no matter. Libby comes across as that sort of young hero that most Americans, I trust, would like to see representing their country overseas, or anywhere. He's conscientious, unflappable, brave, modest, hard working, honest, honorable and loyal. Indeed, his only vices seem to have been, as a cowboy, foolish gambling, and, while as an RFC pilot, a weakness for the British Army's regular rum ration. Girls are only mentioned as reserving their best for the lads in uniform. I suspect that Libby's wilder youthful indiscretions became lost in the retelling. In any case, the chief attraction of HORSES DON'T FLY, besides the personality of Libby himself, are the insights the reader gains into the hard life of a cowboy, and the early years of military aviation when warplanes could be either &quot;pushers&quot; (rear-mounted propeller) or &quot;tractors&quot; (front-mounted propeller), and both pilots and observer-gunners were exposed to the elements and the enemy in open cockpits with neither seatbelts nor those little packages of salted peanuts. Libby himself was personally awarded the Military Cross by King George V at Buckingham Palace for gallantry in action.<br />To Captain Frederick Libby, long dead since 1970, honor is due.hts the reader gains into the hard life of a cowboy, and the early years of military aviation when warplanes could be either &quot;pushers&quot; (rear-mounted propeller) or &quot;tractors&quot; (front-mounted propeller), and both pilots and observer-gunners were exposed to the elements and the enemy in open cockpits with neither seatbelts nor those little packages of salted peanuts.

It's the kind of book that you'll want to read undisturbed at one sitting, while telling the boss, spouse, kids, pets, or whatever, \\"Buzz off!\\" I wish I could award more than 5 stars.<br />The plot is seemingly straight forward enough. Three cons escape from a federal pen in Kansas, hijack a bus carrying two teachers and eight young female students from a school for the deaf, and hole up in an abandoned slaughterhouse on the bank of the Arkansas River. The leader of the Bad Guys is Lou Handy, a smart, amoral and vicious felon that describes himself as \\"cold death\\". And you know what? He is. And what's he going to do with that pliers, screwdriver, wrench and hammer? And is his girlfriend, Pris, going to show up? (Handy is one of those horrific sociopaths that, in our nightmares, lurks just outside our bedroom window in the darkness waiting for us to fall asleep so he can drive a stiletto into our eyes for flipping him off on the freeway that day.) Surrounding the hidey-hole, the local, state and federal team of cops is led by Arthur Potter, a fiftyish and out-of-shape FBI agent, who also happens to be that agency's senior hostage negotiator. Arthur is the Common Man's hero, just your regular shmoe doing a job that he's extraordinarily good at.<br />The strength of this superb novel rests in the distinct individualities of the adversaries, and the non-stop tension as Potter must deal not only with Handy's demands and deadlines, but also with the separate agenda of Kansas state law enforcement that illustrates the saying, \\"We've met the enemy, and they're us.\\"  As a bonus, author Jeffery Deaver, if he did his research right, perhaps gives the reader an insight into the culture of the Deaf. (I mean, how many hearing-impaired people do you know? To my knowledge, I've never met even one.)<br />But certainly the most engaging character of A MAIDEN'S GRAVE is timid and frightened Melanie, the youngest of the two teachers, and who's also deaf. By the end of the story, she's evolved into another person entirely - one that'll leave you stunned.<br />A MAIDEN'S GRAVE is, hands down, the best thriller I've read in a long, long while. I can't recommend it enough. Of course, as I told The Boss to pound sand when he caught me absorbed in its pages instead of preparing the quarterly P&L statement for the stockholders' meeting, I'll now have much more time for reading.chers, and who's also deaf.

The beginning of THE STRAW MEN opens with an intriguing mix of events: in a variation of the Happy Meal, two gunmen methodically mow down eighty-nine (you must be kidding!) lunchtime customers in a backwater McDonald's; a man returning from his parents' funeral finds a note in his father's handwriting that says, \\"We're not dead\\"; a young girl is abducted from a shopping promenade in full view of customers inside a B&N bookstore. (Well, I can understand the last. When I'm browsing in a bookseller and totally focused, Bin Laden himself could charge down the street on a camel firing his AK-47 and I wouldn't notice.) I looked forward to a clever and entertaining connection between these disparate events. But, alas!<br />The \\"men\\" in the title is misleading. There's really only one villain of consequence, The Upright Man, who remains a relatively nebulous figure to the end. There are two principle good guys in the story, John Zandt, an ex-LAPD homicide cop whose life was ruined when his own daughter was abducted and never recovered, and Ward Hopkins, an ex-CIA employee who resigned before his financial misconduct on the job could be discovered. It was Ward's parents who'd ostensibly died, killed in a highway accident. Both John and Ward have sidekicks, the former an FBI agent in official disfavor named Nina whose only claim to notoriety seems to be that she once had an affair with John, and the latter a wise-cracking buddy named Bobby still with the CIA. What a motley group! None of the four had attractive enough personalities to engage this reader's sympathies. One of the two pairs should have been perhaps edited out to yield a tighter storyline.<br />For me, the biggest problem with THE STRAW MEN was a largely incomprehensible plot. The motive for all the evildoing revolves around some murky theory that what is called \\"civilization\\" is but symptomatic of a virus infecting the human genome, and to kill is to be truly free. (Gee, and I thought society's ills are caused by excess fast food consumption. Well, golly, I'm going out for a triple cheeseburger after I finish here.) In any case, the fuzziness of the whole concept culminates in a muddled ending that's both unsatisfying and the apparent basis for a sequel in which (at least) Ward continues to battle a nefarious conspiracy. What nobody told the author, however, is that a follow-up book requires the first offering to be at least above average. For me, THE STRAW MEN isn't, and I'll not pour any more money down this black hole.y excess fast food consumption. Well, golly, I'm going out for a triple cheeseburger after I finish here.)

But he also has an exceptional Momma, and ALL OVER BUT THE SHOUTIN', besides being an autobiography, is Bragg's tribute to this loving and selfless woman.<br />Bragg was born in 1959. His father, perhaps irrevocably damaged psychologically by combat duty in Korea, was an alcoholic spouse abuser who finally deserted his family in 1966. Rick's mother, Margaret, was left struggling to support herself and three sons by picking cotton, doing other people's laundry, and swallowing her pride to accept charity from family and neighbors. This book is Bragg's account of those early years, and his career as a print journalist from reporting high school and college football games in the late 70s to winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1996 while on the staff of the New York Times. Most of all, it's about family - his Mom, her parents, and his brothers (Sam and Mark).<br />That the author is a gifted writer goes without saying. (After all, one doesn't win the Pulitzer by scribbling book reviews for a major website.) ALL OVER BUT THE SHOUTIN' is poignant, sad, affecting and absorbing. It's a page-turner. However, at no time did Rick convince me that he's experienced any joie de vivre. Unlike one of my favorite authors, Laura Shaine Cunningham, who penned the autobiographical SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS and A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY, Bragg comes across as one whose difficult childhood left him one of the walking wounded. I'm not sure his numerous mea culpas scattered throughout the work added value, and the apologia began to get tiresome. Indeed, the whole book seems a prelude to chapter 40 in which the author explains why he is what he is, and apologizes for what he's not and what he hasn't done.<br />The best reason to read ALL OVER BUT THE SHOUTIN' is to become acquainted with Margaret, and perhaps the best chapter is near the end when Rick describes his Momma's very first plane ride and foray out into the larger world - at age 59 - to see her son awarded the Pulitzer in New York City. That chapter alone is worth the price of the book. Margaret is truly the essence of the meaning of \\"Mom\\".ay out into the larger world - at age 59 - to see her son awarded the Pulitzer in New York City.

Even her mother, Mary, detested her as \\"Horrid Dorrie\\". At the beginning of THE HEART OF DANGER, an international graves registration team in disintegrated Yugoslavia unearths a mass grave of Croation villagers, inhabitants of Rosenovici, apparently murdered by their Serbian neighbors from the village of Salika. Dorrie is among the bodies, her face bludgeoned, throat cut, and head bullet pierced. After Mary brings her daughter home in a coffin - outraged at the official indifference of Her Majesty's government, grief-stricken and guilt-ridden - she hires Bill Penn to go to the Balkans, find out why Dorrie was murdered, discover who was responsible, and write a report. Once in Zagreb, Penn discovers that there may be one surviving eyewitness to the crime, an old woman living in the ruins of Rosenovici now behind the cease fire line in Serbian controlled territory. Penn crosses into THE HEART OF DANGER to find the answers.<br /><br />Gerald Seymour is the best writer of believable covert action fiction that I've found on today's bookshelves. Even better than the master, John Le Carr&eacute;, because Seymour's plots move at a somewhat faster pace without sacrificing character development. And this author's heroes aren't indestructible and flawlessly noble like so many protagonists of the genre (especially, it seems, if they're Americans). For example, Penn is a plodding, regular bloke still smarting from being sacked by MI5 after years of faithful service in the trenches because he lacks the higher education necessary for further advancement. So, now he does grotty surveillance jobs for a second rate detective agency, and returns home at night to a sinking marriage. His is a mid-life crisis well underway. As he gradually pieces together Dorrie's last hours, he discovers another side of the girl that compels him to seek justice in her memory. For the first time in a long time, Penn has the opportunity to regain his dignity and a sense of self-worth. Powerful incentive, that.<br /><br />The villain of the piece on the other side of the line is Milan Stankovic, a loving father and husband, once a simple clerk, now popularly acclaimed to be chief of the local militia in Salika. This newly acquired power, plus the memory of Croatian atrocities against his grandparents, burned alive in a church with many other Serbs during WWII, combine into a continuum of tribal violence and hatred. The banality of this evil is unremarkable for the Balkans, but relatively unknown in contemporary America the Melting Pot.<br /><br />In all of Seymour's books that I've read, any victory of good over evil that may occur is of a Pyrrhic sort. It's hard to tell, at the conclusion, which side has sustained the greater loss. It's the novelty of this approach for this genre of fiction, and its commentary on the tolls exacted in real life, that make his works so attractive for me, and I intend to read many more.rs another side of the girl that compels him to seek justice in her memory.

Where were you?	\\"On the mound tonight for the Los Angeles Dodgers ... number 32 ... the great left-hander... Sandy Koufax\\".<br /><br />These were the energizing words coming over the airwaves that I lived for as a teenager in the mid-60s. I was a Dodger fan. More specifically, a Sandy Koufax fan. I never saw him pitch, but rather relied on the Voice of the Dodgers, Vin Scully, to paint in my mind's eye the picture of my hero at work. So, on September 9, 1965, it was after \\"lights out\\" at a private boarding school north of Los Angeles, and I was under the covers with my transistor radio surreptitiously glued to the final inning of Sandy's perfect game against the Chicago Cubs.<br /><br />Consciously or not, former sportswriter Jane Leavy has constructed SANDY KOUFAX: A LEFTY'S LEGACY much the same as Ed Gruver's year 2000 book, [[ASIN:0878332944 Koufax]]. In each, the author alternates multiple chapters about Sandy's upbringing, professional career, and post-retirement with chapters that are a batter by batter account of Sandy's greatest diamond triumphs - at one inning per chapter. In Gruver's story, it was the last game of the 1965 World Series against the Minnesota Twins when Koufax pitched with only two days rest, and clinched the Fall Classic with grit and a fastball. In Leavy's, it's the Perfect Game pitched against the Cubs at Dodger Stadium, when Sandy's performance touched the truly sublime.<br /><br />Based on a wealth of interviews with her subject's friends and former fellow players, Leavy's book provides much more information about Sandy's life and meteoric career than does Gruver's. His Jewishness, the affinity he had with Black players because of it, the racism other players felt towards him during his early years with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and his decision not to pitch the opening game of the '65 World Series because it fell on Yom Kippur. His perception of the pure science of pitching, and how he got the rules of physics to work to his advantage. The hard feelings Koufax still harbors against Walter Alston for mismanaging his early career. The disaster that was baseball's system of signing \\"bonus babies\\". The assault Koufax and Don Drysdale made on the Reserve Clause of the Uniform Players Contract with their famous salary hold-out before the 1966 season. Indeed, while Leavy's chapters on the Perfect Game are models of coherence, sometimes she gets into trouble in the intervening segments with non-sequiturs that left me thinking, \\"Uh, come again\\", and which imparted a certain choppiness to the narrative, as if she had failed to stitch all her information together properly. Examples:<br /><br />\\"Koufax, a bachelor, was Doggett's guest on the postgame show every time he pitched and a collector of countless new electrical appliances.\\" OK. So?<br /><br />On Tommy Lasorda's recollections of his relationship with Koufax: \\"Once he got going on the subject, Lasorda didn't stop, failing to notice that one of the people to whom he was speaking had doubled over in acute pain with stomach cramps.\\" Who was that and why is it relevant? The author doesn't say.<br /><br />\\"The day pitchers and catchers reported (to spring training) was still an occasion observed by tomboys who wore their Mary Janes to school in celebration.\\" Huh? Must be an inside joke.<br /><br />Beyond these infrequent stumbles, Leavy has crafted a book that will surely delight and absorb anyone wishing to revel in the career of Dandy Sandy. A very nice touch in the chapter about the Perfect Game's 9th inning is a verbatim transcription of Vin Scully's radio play-by-play of the action. I can hear it as if it was only yesterday.<br /><br />It should be noted that if one is looking for dirt, there isn't any outside of a passing observation indicating Koufax is capable of telling off-color jokes, and evidence that Sandy would occasionally sneak into the players' dorm after curfew during spring training. The adulation is slavish. Perhaps purists will say that this prevents SANDY KOUFAX from being a balanced and great book. On the other hand, in this era of tell-all journalism, maybe it's better not to know the blemishes. Why sully the rare heroes left to us? As Cubs great Ernie Banks thought while watching number 32 walk out to the mound: \\"It's like being in the ballpark with Jesus.\\"<br /><br />Yeah, but JC didn't have a 100 mph fastball and a curve that dropped as if off the edge of a table.nd, in this era of tell-all journalism, maybe it's better not to know the blemishes.

The time is the 16th century. The place and players are indicated by the book's subtitle, \\"The Story of the Anglo-Scottish Border Reivers\\", reivers being raiders. The place is more specifically the six administrative areas called Marches (3 English and 3 Scottish - West, Middle, and East on each side of the line) which straddled the border to serve as a buffer zone.<br />Having grown up in Carlisle, the former bastion of the English West March, Fraser has written a work of love divided into five parts. In the first three, Fraser describes the genesis of the Border Marches, the Wardens, one per March, that were responsible for the maintenance of order, the raider families that lived there, and the culture and practice of violence that characterized the area. The author's catalog of depredations, based on research of contemporary records, includes murder, arson, blackmail, kidnapping, rustling, racketeering, feuding, plunder, and banditry - all made infinitely worse by the indifference and/or cynical scheming of the English and Scottish central governments which tolerated the not-infrequent participation in the mayhem by the Wardens themselves. Part 4 is a sequential narrative history of events along the Border during the 16th century, the last before James VI of Scotland united the island's thrones as James I of Great Britain. Part 5 describes this monarch's brutal suppression of both the violence and raider families of the Marches during the first decade of the 17th century, an effort that finally brought peace to the region.<br />THE STEEL BONNETS offers a surfeit of detail. At times, as Fraser brings on stage the multitude of principal characters and attempts to unravel the maze of ever-shifting family alliances and feuds (Scot vs. Anglo, Scot vs. Scot, Anglo vs. Anglo, everybody vs. everyone), the reader may decide the author went over the top. However, the story is never uninteresting, and the social chaos is appalling.<br />If the reader was delighted by the humor in Fraser's other books, e.g. the McAuslan and Flashman series, there may be some disappointment as this narrative is relatively straitlaced. However, even here the author's dry wit occasionally shows. Regarding the assumption of the English East March Wardenship by Henry Carey in 1588:<br />\\"... his notion of Border justice was that the only good reiver was a dead one - a point of view which has much to be said for it. Possibly the fact that he suffered from gall-stones made him irritable, for he started in office as he meant to continue, by hanging Scottish thieves.\\"<br />And, as always, Fraser's prose is a joy to behold, as demonstrated by his closing remarks:<br />\\"Only now and then, if your romantic imagination is sharp enough, there can come a little drift from the past ... most vivid of all, perhaps, in a little fellside village at night, when there is a hunter's moon and a strong wind, and the black cloud shadows hurry across the tops, and beasts stamp in the dark, and an inn door down in the village opens and slams with a blink of light, and the rough Norse voices sound and laugh and die away ... The old Border is buried a long time ago, and there is hardly a trace now to mark where the steel bonnets passed by.\\"he top.

In the first Munch Mancini novel, NO HUMAN INVOLVED, author Barbara Seranella's hero was an ex-Bad Girl on the wean from drugs and sexual promiscuity while holding down a job as an auto mechanic. Of course, she was also a murder suspect, but everybody has a bad day now and then. Now, almost eight years later, Munch is the Repairs Manager in the auto shop, has her own off-hours limousine service, is devoted to her 7-year old adopted daughter, Asia, and has a serious crush on the homicide detective, Mace St. John, who was on her case years before. Besides being a best friend to Munch, Mace is comfortably married. Oh, well, even a turned-around life has its bummers.<br />Lest one conclude that Munch has had her ticket punched on the Metrolink train to the suburb named Middle-Class Boredom, UNFINISHED BUSINESS has her being stalked by a vicious rapist who's MO is to torture and kill using electricity. Even more exciting, she's helping secret heartthrob St. John solve the case! It doesn't get better than this.<br />In a wider sense, the best part of any Munch thriller is observing Mancini evolve. The \\"mystery\\" angle of each book is fairly standard stuff though, admittedly, that in UNFINISHED BUSINESS has a nice twist and a half at the end. But what will make me continue to read more of Seranella's offerings is to see down what path the author takes our hero. Munch is a very sympathetic and likable protagonist. Will she ultimately take Mrs. St. John's place in Mace's bed in his converted railroad car? Will she eventually start-up her own Beamer dealership on the Westside? What will be Mom's reaction when Asia becomes old enough to ask questions about drugs, boys, carburetors, or aromatherapy? And what sort of sickos will ooze from underneath those L.A. freeway underpasses to add zest to their lives?<br />Munch, you go, girl!	2002-09-05

As the subtitle of the book indicates, this is &quot;the story of the Oregon Trail&quot;.<br />For the sake of summary, I arbitrarily divide this book into five parts: early  exploration of the Upper Mississippi River by French-Canadians seeking a route to the &quot;western sea&quot;, the Lewis and Clark Expedition and the subsequent unsuccessful efforts to establish an easy route to Oregon via the Missouri River and its headwaters, the influx of &quot;mountain men&quot; into the area and the discovery of a more southerly route (the Oregon Trail), the early settlement in Oregon of Christian missionary groups sent to proselytize the Indians, and the massive immigration of land-seekers in the 1840's which ultimately resulted in the establishment of a U.S. Oregon Territory.<br />WESTWARD VISION is the result of extensive research on the part of the author. Its wealth of details is both its strong point and its undoing. Probably the most commendably concise chapters (5 and 6), considering the length of the event, deal with the amazing Lewis and Clark Expedition. Perhaps Lavender thought the history of the two-year trek adequately covered elsewhere. In any case, the following chapters on the exploits and travails of the fur-trapping mountain men and the missionaries are so full of minutiae that it would require the reader to take extensive notes in order to keep track of the various groups and individuals endeavoring to cross the Great Divide into Oregon in the 1820s and 30s. (Reading this book for pleasure, I wasn't prepared to expend that much effort.) Only in Chapter 19, which gives an account of the 1843 journey of the first large immigrant train - almost 1000 persons- over the Oregon Trail, does the narrative regain a concise clarity. A major failing of the the volume is the lack of adequate maps to locate the majority of the named and innumerable places and geographical features: rivers, river forks, buttes, mountains, rocks, forts, mountain passes, river fords, trapper rendezvous, and settlements. Perusing contemporary state highway maps didn't help much. And in a work this extensive, I would have expected a large section of illustrations. Except for several very crude drawings, there were none.<br />What elevates WESTWARD VISION, and compels me to award four stars, is that the author makes his point magnificently, i.e. that it took many tough people with large reserves of true grit to expand the fledgling United States to the Pacific's shores. The crossing was hard:<br />&quot;At the rainswept crossing of the North Platte, blue with cold, cramped by dysentery and pregnancy pangs, Mary Walker (an 1838 pilgrim) sat down and 'cried to think how comfortable my father's hogs were' (back home). As for Sarah Smith, Mary sniffed, she wept practically the entire distance to Oregon.&quot; And even recreation had a sharp edge, as at the 1832 trappers' rendezvous:<br />&quot;... a few of the boys poured a kettle of alcohol over a friend and set him afire. Somehow he lived through it, and fun's fun.&quot;<br />Finally, Lavender eloquently suggests the reason so many embarked on the Oregon Trail at all:<br />&quot;What matters is not whether fulfillment was attainable in reality (at the Trail's end), but rather that at long last in the world's sad, torn history an appreciable part of mankind thought it might be.

According to some arcane device called the Bostwick Consistometer (\\"Oh, honey, what happened to that old Bostwick we used to have in the attic?\\"), ketchup \\"cannot flow faster than fourteen centimeters in thirty seconds at twenty degrees centigrade\\".  Author Andrew Smith, while citing this fact in PURE KETCHUP, fails to say if this is on a downhill slope or level straightaway. I guess I'll have to conduct my own experiments.<br />This book is otherwise a fascinating and fact filled history of the condiment that only an un-American subversive would fail to gobble up with fries. Starting with the origin of the word - \\"kecap\\" (Indonesia), \\"kê-tsiap\\" (Vietnam?), \\"escaveche\\" (France), \\"iskebêy\\" (Arab) - Smith describes the evolution of ketchup, or catchup, or catsup, from the old days in Europe, when it was made from everything imaginable (grapes, cucumbers, walnuts, oysters, cherries, mushrooms, apples, apricots, gooseberries, currants, anchovies, cranberries), to the present, when it's a distinctly American food made from tomatoes.<br />In the chapter on the growth of the U.S. ketchup industry in the nineteenth century, the author goes to extreme lengths to name seemingly all the manufacturers of the period and every brand name they marketed. Smith followed the same course in his book on popcorn, POPPED CULTURE. I continue to regard his commendable attention to such detail excessive, but I shan't dwell on it here because I liked PURE KETCHUP more than the other anyway.  The best chapter, for me, was the lengthiest one, which describes the bitter battle between pure-food adherents advocating the manufacture of ketchup without preservatives and those espousing the use of such, specifically benzoates. The two camps flailed away at each other for years to the point that even the eventual victor staggered away exhausted. The story of this acrimony might just as well illustrate the course of any debate over food additives or processing, whether it's MSG, aspartame, food irradiation, or the looming conflict over the fat and calorie content of fast foods. As for me, I'm perfectly happy to find the ketchup with the highest content of preservatives, pour it on the biggest order of fries I can buy, and thumb my nose at the Nutrition Gestapo while I chow down.<br />For me, perhaps the major fault of PURE KETCHUP is that it failed to mention, much less define, the place of barbecue and steak sauces in the genealogy of ketchup, if indeed they're related. I was in the supermarket today, and the brands of barbecue sauce far outnumber those of ketchup, and the labels of all I checked included a tomato derivative. So, what about those Andy?

She was unable to see the point in being out on a shelterless rock in a meaningless sea, under a muffled grey sky, where there are no loos and no baths, where there is not even a little copse or spinney in which one can sit down and read, where the house itself is little better than a shed, where the wind blows and blows and where your husband is for some reason obsessed with every fact and detail of this godforsaken nowhere.&quot;<br />Such is the enthusiasm for the Shiant Isles exhibited by the wife of Adam Nicolson, author of SEA ROOM. Adam is owner of these roughly six hundred acres distributed over three wave and wind ravaged islands in the Minch, that stretch of ocean lying between the Scottish island of Skye and the Outer Hebrides. Adam had inherited them from his father, who purchased them in 1937.<br />The author does indeed examine every fact and detail that can be known or surmised about this edge on civilization's margin: the art of getting there by small boat, the migratory bird life, its human history as revealed by archeology and public records, its geology, its successive native industries over the centuries (farming, fishing, kelping, sheepherding), and its weather. Occasionally, there's unintended humor, as when he describes the labors involved in transferring some cattle off the island by coastal steamer:<br />&quot;The men waited below (the steamer) in the dinghy as the poor beast was lifted by its horns high into the air, bellowing at the indignity and with fear.  Just as the animal was high above the gunwale, the men in the dinghy guiding it in by the tail, the bullock emptied the entire contents of its four stomachs over the men below. That was the last time any cattle were seen on the Shiants.&quot; Or, when he describes the equally valiant efforts of the rams (tups) sent to the islands to impregnate the resident ewes:<br />&quot;The tups are put on in November, about eight or nine of them for the three hundred-odd ewes, and are taken off in February, knackered (exhausted).&quot; Yes, well, that's the plight of us males everywhere regardless of species. It's a tough and thankless but necessary job.<br />Most of SEA ROOM is a sober narrative about ordinary life on, and the ecosystem of, the Shiants - ordinary with a capital &quot;O&quot;.  After all, through the centuries no more than perhaps thirty people have called the islands home at any one time. It was never the site of a great city, or the center of an empire, or the scene of heroic accomplishment beyond just making a life in a remote and inhospitable place. Indeed, the Shiants have lacked permanent human residents for the past hundred years. Thus, while Nicolson's magnificent prose makes the story reasonably interesting, it wasn't enough to earn more than four stars in my opinion ... that is, until the concluding chapter. It's because of these last pages, a heartfelt and poignant manifesto of the author's great and consuming love for this far-flung spot, a legacy for his son Tom, that I finally awarded five stars for the whole.<br />&quot;I was left alone in the silence, with the pale sun on my face, and, as the dogs nosed for nothing in the grasses, I started to fall asleep there to the long, asthmatic rhythm of the surf.

One of Frank's clients is rich brat Mel Merdock, running for a Virginia U.S. Senate seat against the incumbent, Lou Kay. The Virginia race is taking a normally sleazy course until the night one of Frank's partners, Woody, is murdered in the firm's offices. The reader alone knows from the first bullet that the killer is Raymond, but is left with Frank to discover the motive and Raymond's employer.  Frank's management of Mel's campaign becomes increasingly manic and disjointed as he delves into Woody's killing in the face of police complacency and a rash of additional bodies hitting the pavement.<br />I was taught long ago that the necessary elements in a work of fiction are a protagonist, an antagonist, and a conflict between the two. Although everything else is window dressing, common sense suggests that the author make the protagonist at least reasonably heroic in the sympathies of the reader. And what is Frank? He's a disinformation artist that manipulates the media in any way possible, using whatever blend of fact and fiction works, to bamboozle the electorate into voting for his candidate over the other guy. Now, maybe I'm an old-fashioned troglodyte, but is this the 21st century's idea of heroic? Who would admire such a political pimp other than other media consultants and the politicians he serves? Darned if I know. And that's why it was hard for me to care about Miles and his predicaments at any point in this thriller. Had he been gunned down by the Bad Guy, I might have even cracked a smile. If Frank is the lead character in future Ellis novels, I won't be buying.<br />My blatant prejudice against our \\"hero\\" aside, the plot of ACCESS TO POWER is commendably clever and complex for a debut work. Almost too complex, since, as the personal and professional betrayals between the characters accumulated, I nearly had to keep a scorecard of who was stabbing whom in the back. It wasn't a pretty sight.<br />Had this been a book from an accomplished writer of fiction, I would likely have awarded 3 stars at most.

And George Apley of (merely) Boston is fictional.<br />Author John Marquand has invented a make-believe chronicler named Mr. Willing to tell the story of the latter's life long friend, George Apley (1866-1933). The biographer's source material is comprised primarily of his own recollections and numerous letters exchanged between Apley and friends and family over the decades. Willing begins with a brief account of George's ancestry, then proceeds through his subject's birth, boyhood, and years at Harvard and law school forward to his marriage, the birth of his children, then his sojourns in middle and old age.<br />The trouble with this novel is that it seems Marquand didn't have a clear vision of the point he was trying to make. On one hand, Willing's biography is sympathetic. He obviously admires Apley for being a loyal friend, loving husband and father, fair and considerate employer, principled gentleman, and patriotic American. Willing doesn't condemn his friend's gradual alienation from his children and a changing society as he ages. (What a surprise!) And his generally favorable bias doesn't prevent him from mentioning Apley's low opinion of the Irish, Catholics, and Jews, but he doesn't dwell upon these flaws - perhaps because he was of like mind. Taken at this face value, the book is a simple tribute to a good and upstanding life however unprepossessing it may have been.<br />On the other hand, without any obvious malice, Marquand (through Willing again) manages to convey the fact that Apley takes himself, his family name, his privileged class, and Boston way too seriously.  Anything beyond the Boston city limits is held in a frank disregard verging on contempt. He fails to heed the words of an uncle who found it necessary to counsel: &quot;Most people in the world don't know who the Apleys are and they don't give a damn.&quot; Also, Marquand attributes to his fictional subject no great achievements on the national or world stage. Rather, George spends a lifetime attending the board meetings of charities, participating in &quot;intelligent discussion&quot; groups and clubs, dabbling in the minutiae of local politics, and dispensing unheeded advice to his offspring. Because of all this, I've decided that THE LATE GEORGE APLEY is, in the balance, more of a gentle satire than anything else. The thing is, it's too subtle for this 21st century reader. (Perhaps it was more appreciated in the year first published - 1936.) It's as if Marquand didn't love or hate the type of man or social class his subject represents with sufficient enough fervor to be truly effective at either.<br />At the very best, THE LATE GEORGE APLEY is an interesting description of the evolution of a gentleman and society of that time and place. I liked it to that extent, but was left with the nagging regret that my time would've been better spent reading a contemporary account of a real individual whose life had made ripples in a pond bigger than that of the city he or she lived in.

In STORMING HEAVEN, none of these are at the root of All Evil, and the Vatican gets a breather for once.<br />This time around, our hero is Mark Beamon, the troublesome but brilliant FBI agent exiled to the position of agent-in-charge of the bureau's Flagstaff office, an out-in-the-stix outpost of the Big House down in Phoenix. Mark is investigating the gunshot deaths of Eric and Patricia Davis and the disappearance of their teenage daughter Jennifer. (It's not apparent, or ever explained, why the local cops aren't a presence and the Feds have been brought into the case. It's uncertain at the outset that Jennifer was kidnapped, much less taken across state lines, the only rationale for FBI involvement.) In any case, before the storyline progresses too far the reader knows, and Beamon suspects, that the hierarchy of the Kneissians, a global religious cult, is up to no good in the affair.<br />Mark is the best reason to bother with STORMING HEAVEN. He's intolerant of nonsense emanating from the Front Office, unlucky when it comes to women, physically unprepossessing, and waging a losing battle with cigarettes, alcohol and a middle-age waistline. And he's irreverant. At one point in his investigation, he's asked by an ally to pray with her for their success:<br />\\"She pulled at his sleeve and he sank to his knees next to her wheelchair. She squeezed her eyes shut and began moving her lips soundlessly. Not really knowing what to do, he bowed his head and waited for her to snap out of it.\\"<br />And he's realistic about the strengths of the character flaws laid at his door by his superiors, as when he's questioning a difficult suspect:<br />\\"It was time to make a decision on how to play this. There was the smart way, of course ... But that seemed kind of boring. The other option was to shoot himself in the foot and see if he could make the ice princess sweat a little.\\"<br />I'd give the book three stars except for Beamon, who elevates it another click. Otherwise, the storyline is only marginally inventive, and the Kneissians aren't in the same league as the Vatican when it comes to truly insidious plotting.

Each generation, I suppose, has its favorite fictional Tough Guys. For my parents, it may have been Bogart and The Duke. For me, they've been Clint, Bruce, and Mel on the Big Screen, and the literary British spy Quiller. However, in the past couple of years, Jack Reacher has arrived on the killing fields. And he's perhaps tougher, certainly smarter, than any who've gone before.<br />A former Army major assigned to the Military Police, Jack has been aimlessly roaming the United States through several novels, and attracting big trouble in each one. In ECHO BURNING, he's hitchhiked into sunburnt West Texas where he's given a ride by Carmen Greer, who's cruising the highways on the lookout for a Tough Guy. Carmen lives with her young daughter, Ellie, on an arid ranch with her hateful brother-in-law and mother-in-law while her husband, Sloop, serves time in a federal pen for tax evasion. According to the story Carmen spins, her spouse had been viciously beating her for years. Since Sloop is due to be released in forty-eight hours, Carmen expects the beatings to begin anew, especially since she was the one that ratted on Sloop to the IRS. Will Reacher kill him for her? No? Well, will he at least teach her how to shoot the dainty pistol she's purchased? (In the meantime, what's with that team of three professional assassins circling the ranch unbeknownst to all? Jack may discover his hands full.)<br />All those other Tough Guys I mentioned are smart, but not so much that they don't sporadically get beaten up and kicked silly by the Bad Guys. But not Reacher - nobody gets the drop on him. When the reader sees a violent confrontation looming, he almost feels sorry for the villains for the World of Hurt in which they'll soon find themselves. By his own admission, Jack's a hard man who likes cockroaches better than the men (and women) he's sometimes forced to exterminate.<br />Reacher is endlessly fascinating. Having gone from one Army post to another, first as an Army brat and then on his own as an MP officer, he's never known a permanent home. So, now he chooses to live as a near-vagrant, shunning commitment to material things and the occasional interesting woman. He travels only with testosterone and a toothbrush, buying cheap clothes to wear and discard as he goes. He's educated, intelligent and gentlemanly, but excruciatingly asocial (as opposed to antisocial, which he's not) and heroically ignorant about how a \\"normal\\" life - wife, house, mortgage, kids, dog, 9 to 5, and Lexus - is lived. This is a man whom all you single ladies out there would love the chance to improve. (Don't cave, Jack!

Perhaps it's because on those very rare occasions when I visit the annual Los Angeles County Fair, I steer clear of the games and beeline for the junk food. (Once a long time ago, I tried to show off to my then fianc&eacute;e at an amusement park shooting booth and failed miserably. We eventually married, but she refuses to call me \\"Bwana\\". Perhaps this book will give me an edge for a major comeback in spousal respect.)<br />SECRETS will likely appeal to a very narrow niche market. I'm probably not a legitimate occupier of that cranny, but am giving the volume the benefit of the doubt with 4 stars anyway. (At my level of carny involvement, 5 seems cheeky.) Author Brian Richardson seems to know what he's talking about as he advises the reader on how to increase the odds of winning at the Milk Can Softball Toss, the Peach Basket Softball Toss, the BB Gun Star Shootout, the Ring Toss, the Sign Ball Bounce Off, the Curly Bar Ring Guide, the Basketball Shoot, and several others. In the Ring Toss, for instance, is it better to go with a throw of high or low arc, and is it done overhand or underhand? Brian instructs. A nice touch on the first page is an impressive photo of (apparently) all the stuffed animals the author has won using his tried and true techniques. Richardson also includes two chapters on the games he personally avoids, and the Top Ten steel and wooden roller coasters in America.<br />Brian has obviously had a lot of fun gathering the material for this little paperback - 85 pages in a 4 x 6.5 inch format.

Thank goodness I'm not paranoid!<br />The premise of Tolstoy's last short novel, written in 1904, is that the effects of individual actions, whether good or bad, ripple through society causing unexpected consequences far removed in time and place from the original deed. THE FORGED COUPON begins with a father angrily denying his son an advance on his allowance, causing the latter to forge an inflated value on the coupon he's given instead. (In the storyline's time and place, coupons clipped from interest-bearing documents were commonly used as money.) The eventual repercussions of this act provide the background against which Tolstoy lashes out against the flaws he perceived in pre-Revolution Russian society: upper class greed, the oppression of the peasant class, the spiritual and moral bankruptcy of the Russian Orthodox Church, the unfairness of the justice system, and the intellectual banality of the political leadership up to and including the Tsar. As a solution to his society&iacute;s ills, the author proposes a return to Christian fundamentalism based solely on scripture, and fictionally illustrates how acts grounded in such can be just as influential in the long term as those generated by mankind's baser motives.<br />The reader will perhaps find truths in THE FORGED COUPON depending on his/her personal value system. But is the book well done? The front cover of my edition calls it \\"a classic tale of crime and guilt\\". Well, it's certainly a tale of crime and guilt, but it misses being classic simply because it's too short. It's as if Tolstoy, who died in 1910, realized his life was coming to a close and thought he'd better crank this one out in a hurry. Had he taken the time to expand the novel to several hundred pages and develop the characters and storyline more, it perhaps would have had more impact. THE FORGED COUPON comes across as a rush job. Indeed, the CliffsNotes version is probably longer than the 88 pages of my edition of the original.

To be more precise, it was the result of a drunken gamble made with a buddy that in itself doesn't make much sense. The bet was for 100 British pounds, and the refrigerator cost Hawks 130 pounds. What was he thinking? By the way, in case you're wondering, the fridge in question was a small cube perhaps two feet or less on a side, not one of the behemoths in which one stores provisions for a family of six (or beer and frozen pizza for a single bachelor).<br />The terms of the wager allowed Hawks, a comedian by profession, one calendar month to hitchhike the circumference of Ireland with fridge in tow. A month can accommodate a fair number of paying gigs. So, with apparently that much free time on his hands, one wonders how successful a comedian Tony was at the time (1997). Well, that's neither here nor there. In any case, the author's talent for dry humor translates well to the printed medium, as when he observes:<br />\\"Shooting hordes of insubordinate natives was acceptable when 'needs must', but jumping a queue was always quite intolerable. The whole raison d'être for a vast British Empire had been a desire to teach the ignorant peoples of the world how to queue correctly.\\" Quite right. I think even the Queen would agree.<br />Indeed, it's the humor of ROUND IRELAND WITH A FRIDGE that supports the narrative as far as it goes. It falls short as a travel essay, which, in my mind, should be descriptive of the locale being traversed. Beyond this reader's conclusion that the Irish are remarkably tolerant of and generous to eccentrics, most of the insights gained don't extend beyond the walls of the many pubs where Hawks spends his hours when not actually on the road. Granted, this isn't entirely the author's fault. The friendly Irish are just always offering to buy him a pint. However, as an example, at one stage in his journey Tony and the fridge are coveyed between points A and B by a white van with \\"Galway Swan Rescue\\" emblazoned on the side. Now, I'd like to know what a swan rescuer does, but Hawks never tells, and my curiosity remains unsatisfied. This lack of useful information pervades the volume as a whole. In the end, the book's 247 pages were amusing enough to warrant three stars, but it's mindless reading with a capital \\"M\\".

In the earliest, it's World War Two and German factory owner Klaus Felsen is recruited into the SS for a crucial mission to Portugal. His orders are to buy or steal all of that country's wolfram (tungsten) he can lay his hands on. A handy substance, wolfram is used in making the \\"hardened munitions\\" that destroy tanks.  In the latest, it's 1998 and Lisbon homicide detective Ze Coelho is investigating the sodomization and murder of sixteen year old Catarina Oliveira whose body was dumped on a local beach.<br />The world-weary Coelho is, as you might suspect, the plot's hero. He's rendered even more of a sympathetic character by the recent death of his beloved wife, by the rebelliousness of an otherwise loving teenage daughter, and by his professional partnership with a young detective with an attitude, Carlos, who climbs on more than just Coelho's nerves. On the other hand, Felsen isn't content with just being the Bad Guy. He's one of the more despicable villains around because he has no apparent scruples whatsoever. And he breeds uncontrollably, a fact that builds the congenital bridge to Coelho's case.<br />At 451 paperbacked pages, A SMALL DEATH IN LISBON verged on being too long. It wasn't until the last hundred or so pages when Coelho began to tease the riddle apart and the plot twists were revealed that I began to consider awarding more than three stars. Perhaps it's also that Ze is about the only likeable character in the book, and I wish he'd been given more text space than the detestable Klaus. Also on the plus side is the ending which is, like real life, somewhat untidy. I find that refreshing.	2002-07-16

Well, the view from my front window includes that hill's reverse slope. That back side has ... nothing, which is about all I knew of Hollywood's golden era despite the fact that I've lived in the environs of Los Angeles just about all of my adult life. From the vantage point of such abysmal ignorance, I found LOST HOLLYWOOD to be one of the more entertaining and interesting books I've read recently.<br />In twenty-three chapters, journalist-author David Wallace takes the reader as far back as the 1870's to begin his narrative, most of which focuses on the evolution of the Tinseltown movie industry, its stars, and associated glitz from around 1911 through the glory years of the 20s, 30s, 40s, and into the 50s. Each chapter has its own stand-alone topic, e.g. Cecil B. DeMille, D.W. Griffith, Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, the arrival of \\"talkies\\", the Hotel Hollywood, the studio contract system, the Hollywood sign, gossip mongers Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, the stars' cars, the stars' yachts, the Cocoanut Grove, the Hollywood Canteen, and Schwab's drugstore. Much of the volume's diversion value lies in the fascinating, sometimes titillating, trivia it contains. Did you know that womanizer Errol Flynn's custom-built Packard had a passenger seat that became a bed at the touch of a button, and the license plate read \\"R U 18\\"? Or that New York opera star Geraldine Farrar was paid two dollars per minute of daylight for every day she was in Hollywood filming \\"Carmen\\"? Or that the fake palm trees in the Cocoanut Grove were leftover props from Valentino's film \\"The Sheik\\"? Or that Paulette Goddard got the female lead in \\"North West Mounted Police\\" after slapping her bare foot on director DeMille's desk knowing it would appeal to his foot fetish?<br />My only criticism of LOST HOLLYWOOD is that it cries out for more pictures. True, there's a relevant period photo at the beginning of each chapter, but it just isn't enough. At 188 pages in paperback, it's a book I was compelled to read in a single day, reluctantly wasting time on other nuisance activities like my job, sleeping and household chores.

A Scrooge in the making for some time, Luther finally snaps after calculating that the last Yule Season cost him a whopping sixty-one hundred dollars. With Nora's reluctant agreement, he decides that this year there'll be no tree, cards, gifts, party, charitable giving, or lawn displays. Only a cruise to the Caribbean. Bah humbug!<br />The going gets tough and the tough get going as the Kranks turn away the Boy Scouts selling Christmas trees, the police taking donations for a toys-for-deprived-tots campaign, and the firemen and medics selling fruitcakes to fund another of the same. Most antisocial of all is their decision not to mount an illuminated Frosty figure on the roof, something that all other residents along Hemlock Street do in the hope winning the local award for best street decoration. Talk about peer pressure! Despite much skeptical and disapproving shaking of heads by neighbors and co-workers, the Kranks actually appear to be on the brink of pulling it off, including losing weight and acquiring a tanning salon bronze in preparation for the lazy days aboard ship. Then comes the disastrous phone call on Christmas Eve morning.<br />Luther is a 54-year old apprentice curmudgeon. At 53, I can relate to the man's disenchantment with the Holiday Season, and would myself drop out of the festive occasion if my Better Half would let me get away with it. (Ha, fat chance!) In any case, I was cheering Luther on every step of his perilous way. Having betrayed my bias in the matter, the book's ending still satisfactorily illustrates the value of the support network presumably found in some long-established urban neighborhoods.<br />SKIPPING CHRISTMAS would, I think, make a terrific movie, perhaps starring Michael Keaton and Frances McDormand. My chief objection to the book is the big hardback price for a very small volume, which can be read in a couple of hours even by the most lethargic of readers.

After boarding travelers in Athens for a flight to Rome, Craig is faced with the Greek police who want to arrest one of his First Class passengers, John Harris, a former President of the United States. Harris is wanted on an Interpol warrant initiated by the Peruvian government. Peru charges that Harris, in violation of an international treaty against torture, sanctioned atrocities that occurred during a CIA-sponsored raid on a Peruvian heroin factory during the Harris Administration. As a former U.S. Air Force pilot now in the reserves, Dayton's instinct to protect a former Commander-in-Chief takes over, and he backs his jet away from the gate, overturning a loaded baggage tram in the process, and vamooses out of Dodge, so to speak. Thus begins a chase across Europe, Harris in the 737 pursued by the Lear carrying Stuart Campbell, the international lawyer retained by Peru to bring the fugitive to bay.<br />HEADWIND is an engrossing read if one accepts the shaky premise that an American pilot, sufficiently dedicated to guard the welfare of an ex-President, would also be enough of a cowboy to endanger his job, his crew, and the 118 paying passengers aboard his plane. To a certain degree, Dayton is a hero of the plot, though a bigger one is Jay Reinhart, a friend of the ex-President's and an expert in international law, whom Harris retains as his attorney. Jay, a former Texas District Judge, has recently been reinstated to the bar after having suffered a suspension for falling in love with a female defendant on trial in his court for murder. In any case, Jay now has to scramble from his Wyoming hideaway to Europe where the chase is on.<br />Author John Nance does a swell job alternating the action between foreign courtrooms and the 737's flight deck, and there's sufficient tension, especially in the latter, for me to have gnawed away the edges of my expensive manicure. (Darn! Where's that emery board?) And all the while there's the question, \\"Is Harris really innocent of the charges?\\" After all, there's that pesky videotape.<br />Although the ending is cloyingly happy as all loose ends are tidied up - a pet peeve of mine, HEADWIND is the perfect thriller for your next plane flight. If you're going roundtrip coast to coast, you'll finish before you touch down on the home leg. Check to see if any of our ex-Presidents are in First Class as you board, and yell \\"Hey, Bubba!\\" if you see Bill.And all the while there's the question, \\"Is Harris really innocent of the charges?\\" After all, there's that pesky videotape.<br />Although the ending is cloyingly happy as all loose ends are tidied up - a pet peeve of mine, HEADWIND is the perfect thriller for your next plane flight.

In his book, Fraser mentions the high regard the troops had for the army commander, William Slim. I subsequently read DEFEAT INTO VICTORY by Field-Marshal Viscount Slim, a personal account by the man who commanded the Fourteenth Indian Army during its bitter retreat from, and its glorious return march through, Burma. In his volume, Slim mentions the unorthodox British general Orde Wingate's contributions to the Japanese defeat in Southeast Asia. Thus, FIRE IN THE NIGHT, Wingate's biography.<br />Co-authored by John Bierman and Colin Smith, FIRE IN THE NIGHT is the immensely readable life story of an incredibly complex man. In a nutshell, after several brief chapters on Wingate's early life, the narrative sequentially covers his postings in Palestine, Ethiopia and, finally, India/Burma, during which time (1936-1944) he rose in rank from Lieutenant to Major General. In the British Mandate of Palestine, Orde became an ardent Zionist while fighting Arab \\"gangs\\" with Special Night Squads, the armed detachments of British regulars and Jews which he himself brought into being. In Ethiopia, his was a key role in the British victorious military effort to drive the Italians from the country and return Haile Selassie to the thrown. In India, Wingate's ultimate triumph before an untimely death was to conceive, form, train and deploy the Third Indian Division, the \\"Chindits\\", as a Special Force to insert behind Japanese lines in Northern Burma to destroy the enemy's means of communication and supply.<br />To my mind, the strength of this book is that it gives the reader an excellent overview of Wingate the man and soldier without getting bogged down in an overabundance of detail. Certainly, the subject of Wingate's character, obsessions and eccentricities could fill volumes. He was admired and loved by the men he literally led into battle. (He drove them hard, but he drove himself even harder.) Conversely, he was loathed by many of his officer peers and superiors for his arrogance, outspokenness, rudeness and personal slovenliness. (He was on record as calling some of his more Blimpish superiors \\"military apes\\".) But, he also had his admirers in high places, most notably Winston Churchill and Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of all allied forces in Southeast Asia.<br />Perhaps the most endearing of Wingate's traits were his eccentricities. For example, he carried a wind-up alarm clock on his person because he considered watches unreliable. And then there was his attitude to personal nudity best illustrated by an incident during the wide press acclaim following his first Chindit campaign. An Australian correspondent invited to the general's hotel room in Delhi wrote:<br />\\"I found him sitting naked on his bed, eyes buried deep in a book. He hardly glanced up as I entered and rather gruffly asked what I wanted. ... He wasn't interested in me or my requirements, but seemed most excited about the book he was reading ... a critical commentary of Emily Bronte and her work.\\"<br />Can you imagine those media hogs of the Second World War - Patton, Montgomery and MacArthur - doing that?could fill volumes.

OK, ok, so I'm obviously a tad behind on my reading. (I only just recently got around to the fine print on my birth certificate which lists the warranty exclusions.)<br />\\"To my mind, the greatest reward and luxury of travel is to be able to experience everyday things as if for the first time, to be in a position in which almost nothing is so familiar that it can be taken for granted.\\"<br />Perhaps the spirit of the statement is hard to realize nowadays when even Ulan Bator boasts (?) a McDonalds. However, its author, travel writer Bill Bryson, has, as this anthology's editor, pulled together twenty-six tales that will transport the armchair traveler far beyond the well-trod tourist paths. And I say this as one whose wimpy idea of adventure is to dine on a scorching curry in one of London's Balti houses after an afternoon exploring the book stacks at Foyle's.<br />The only journey in this volume that's personally appealing is the one to Bhutan described by Jessica Maxwell in \\"Inside the Hidden Kingdom\\". (That was until I searched the Web for Bhutan tours and was faced with the eye-popping cost of such a trek. Winning the California Lotto will be a pre-requisite, I'm afraid.) Otherwise, scouring France and Spain for the perfect first alcoholic drink of the day, or attending the World Ice Golfing Championship 250 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Greenland, isn't a trip I'll queue for. Neither is spending the night in the depths of New York's Central Park, searching for the remnants of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia's remote highlands, traveling by donkey into Morocco's Atlas Mountains, picking-up hitchhikers in Cuba, or journeying down the Congo River on an over-crowded, squalid, passenger barge. I admire those who do such things, and it makes for great storytelling, but I'm way too soft.<br />In all the modern travel essays I've read, even if they're about trips to hell and back, nobody is ever permanently hurt. That fact is what makes so horrific \\"The Last Safari\\" by Mark Ross, a former safari guide, who tells of the time he and several clients were kidnapped in Uganda by border-crossing, machete-wielding rebels from the Congo.

Having said that ...<br />The plot of GUEST SHOT has a serial killer appearing as the Mystery Guest on a fictional version of America's most popular afternoon talk show called \\"Stoner\\" hosted by somebody named - you guessed it - Stoner.  On his first gig, MG states his intent to kill somebody. On following appearances, he relates how the killing went and how many people he's going to murder next. The way he manages to get on nation-wide TV without being apprehended is too long to explain here. Let's just say that technology is a wonderful thing.<br />Unfortunately, there's nothing about GUEST SHOT that elevates it above the ordinary. The NYPD detective initially in charge of the case is Lt. Dorothea Zenobia Hayes - \\"DZ\\" for short. Of course, she's attractive, single, and fighting for recognition in a male-dominated profession. So, the storyline must necessarily explore whether or not she finds true love, and whether or not she can catch the evildoer in the face of censure by no less than the Police Commissioner for her unorthodox approach. (At least Dirty Harry in another age didn't have to worry about the first one!) Since DZ knows the identity of the killer well before the end of the book, the only question remaining is whether or not she can get enough proof to slap on the cuffs. And even though the author, David Locke, could have twisted the plot into a surprise finale for which even I saw the potential, he declined the opportunity to be clever. The actual takedown of the murderer was implausible - the cavalry, standing right outside the proverbial door, would have arrived much sooner in real life. And the very conclusion, the second-to-last sentence, was too cute to the point of being positively lame.<br />GUEST SHOT is not so much a bad read as just one with nothing particularly ingenious to recommend it. With so much better out on the pulp fiction racks, why bother?r />GUEST SHOT is not so much a bad read as just one with nothing particularly ingenious to recommend it.

A Plains dust storm in May 1934 dropped an estimated 12 million tons of topsoil on Chicago. Brown-colored dust storms originate in Kansas, and red ones in Oklahoma. Among the Indians, two knives, a pair of leggings, a blanket, a gun, a horse, and a tipi might be bartered for a wife. (Hey, I got ripped off! I had to trade four knives, three horses, a squirt gun, and $50-worth of McDonald's coupons.) Roughly 10% of those pilgrims traveling the Oregon Trail to the West died enroute (34,000 of 350,000). The first man Thomas Jefferson (as Secretary of State) sent to explore the West was John Ledyard in 1785 - preceding Lewis and Clark by 18 years. Contrary to nuclear apocalypse films, the 110-ton concrete door topping U.S. missile silos doesn't slide or swing open at weapon launch; it's blown out and away by internal charges. And there's no known photo or drawing of Crazy Horse.<br />The fact that the author gathered material for GREAT PLAINS from several trips makes it all somewhat jumbled. Only the starting and ending points are the same - Montana. Probably the best chapter, because of the author's concluding eloquent tribute to the man, is the one that describes the life and shameful death of the Sioux war chief Crazy Horse. Otherwise, Frazier haphazardly touches on the history, geography, peoples, personages and events of his vast subject in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, North Dakota, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota.<br />Now, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed this book because I learned something about places I'll likely never see. But it isn't, in my mind, great travel writing in the tradition of, say, Eric Newby.

THE DESCENT elaborates on that fear, but on a far grander scale. The boogiemen, in this case, are of the species Homo hadalis, an ancient offshoot of Homo erectus, on a co-existing evolutionary track with man. The \\"hadals\\" live in an Earth-encompassing network of caverns and tunnels extending miles below the surface. And sometimes not so deep. (Let's just say I won't be digging myself a bomb shelter anytime soon.) The hadals aren't our jolly cousins either; the mother-in-law from hell would be better company on Thanksgiving. During an underground survey expedition, humans find:<br />\\"A giant skeleton - possibly a human freak - lay in shackles solid with rust. The forensic anthropologist thought the deeply incised geometric patterns on the giant's skull had been made at least a year before the prisoner's death. Judging by the cut marks around the entire skull, it seemed the giant had been scalped and kept alive as a showcase for (the hadals') artwork.\\"<br />Author Jeff Long has crafted a riveting sci-fi epic that is not easily put down. Early on in the storyline, Mankind learns of the hadals' existence and fights the underground war by which the latter are ostensibly eradicated. Then, the Helios mega-corporation sends a survey team to cross underneath the Pacific Ocean's floor in order to lay claim to undiscovered riches outside international boundaries. In hindsight, maybe that wasn't a good idea. The two main characters in THE DESCENT are Ike Crockett and Ali von Schade. Ike, a former mountain guide, has been rescued from hadal slavery after more than a decade of torment. Ali is a Catholic nun whose passion is researching proto-languages. Both accompany the Helios expedition.

I admit that I number among them. BALKAN GHOSTS inspires me to get on my knees every night and give thanks that my homeland is the US of A.<br />Author Robert Kaplan's book, first published in 1993, is part travel essay, part historical narrative, and part social and political commentary as he examines the past and present of Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece. Unfortunately, it's nine years outdated and fails to address the most recent eruptions of ethnic violence in a disintegrated Yugoslavia. However, having said that, BALKAN GHOSTS dispersed much of the ignorance and confusion with which I'd regarded the region. A primary thread that runs throughout is the presence of long-standing, tribal animosities lurking just below the surface in each country, and which periodically erupt into spasms of violence and genocide that make the worst recorded treatment of Native Americans and Blacks in the U.S. almost tame by comparison. Serbs versus Croats. Serbs versus Albanians. Bulgarians versus Serbs. Bulgarians versus Romanians. Bulgarians versus Greeks. Macedonians versus Bulgarians. Macedonians versus Greeks. Macedonians versus Albanians. Romanians versus Russians. Romanians versus Hungarians. Roman Catholic Christians versus Eastern Orthodox Christians. Communists versus everybody. Rightists versus leftists. Everybody versus the Turks, i.e. the Muslims. And, when it's slow on a Saturday night, mount a pogrom against the Jews. As Kaplan puts it:<br />\\"As always in the Balkans, bare survival provides precious little room for moral choices.\\"<br />Perhaps the most revealing chapters are the last three on Greece. Since the author lived there for seven years rather than just pass through, he strongly suggests that the country Westerners revere as the \\"cradle of Western civilization\\" has perhaps long since disappeared into the unfathomability of the East.

Used to city life, young Isabel must adapt to a world without electricity, indoor plumbing, central heating, regular mail service, roads, female companionship, immediate medical care, and contemporary conveniences of any sort. She and her husband build cabins, barns, fences, boats, spinning wheels, stoves, heaters, saddles, wells, and animal pens. Food not grown or hunted locally must be brought in by packhorse over many miles of rough terrain. One endures mosquitoes, floods, bears, wolves, snow and freezing cold. And no, one just can't jump into the SUV and drive down to the local Wal-Mart.<br />Recently, PBS television aired a series entitled \\"Frontier House\\" in which three American families volunteer to re-create life as homesteaders in Montana of the 1880s. For several months, they sampled exactly what the Edwards lived for real for years, but did it with much more whining. What's remarkable about Isabel's narrative is the matter-of-fact good humor in which she tells it. Perhaps it's because it was written many years after the fact (1980), and time mellowed memories of what must have been an incredibly exacting experience. One can only admire the stamina and fortitude it must have taken to build a life under such conditions. (Hey, I start complaining when the Sunday paper isn't delivered on time!)<br />RUFFLES ON MY LONGJOHNS seems much longer than its 297 paperbacked pages. Perhaps it's the typeset. In any case, it's a darn good yarn. And if anybody still believes such a life is glamorous, consider the following passage in which the author describes rescuing a pig during a flood.<br />\\"Racing back to the house, I found Earle sloshing around in the flooded pen, trying to catch her. Between us, we cornered her, and carrying her upside down by the legs, she wriggled and twisted and screamed as though she were being murdered.

In the prologue, Amory writes about his deceased pet cat, Polar Bear:<br />\\"I shall dwell ... on the past and the fun we had for the fifteen years we had together.\\"<br />As the reader discovers, this is just not so. As a matter of fact, most of the author's narrative is born of the time before Polar Bear came into his life. Amory remembers his first job. Amory ruefully recounts his brief stint as a Hollywood scriptwriter. Amory tells of his association with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor when he was commissioned to ghost-write the autobiography of the latter. Amory revisits his time as a reviewer for TV Guide. Or, if after, then THE BEST CAT EVER gets hardly more than honorable mention. Amory discusses arthritis and its cures. Amory revisits his alma mater, Harvard. Amory is hit by a truck.<br />I can't say that this short book isn't entertaining. If I had harbored, before picking it up, any interest in the author, and if the book and been entitled REMINISCENCES OF CLEVELAND (or something of the sort), then I should happily award 4, and perhaps 5, stars. Amory is indeed talented and astute, as when he states of Wallis Warfield's morganatic marriage to the abdicated King Edward VIII:<br />\\"If she settled for being a morganatic wife, not only would she not be a Queen, she would have settled for something which, to her at least, sounded all too much like being a peasant.\\"<br />Amory's dry wit notwithstanding, I can only award 3 stars because Polar Bear, most of the time, just isn't there. The best chapter is certainly the last, in which Cleveland poignantly and sadly describes his beloved pet's last illness and the trauma of having him put to sleep. (I was, perhaps, reminded of the advancing age of my own cat, Trouble. While still healthy at 10 years, that heartbreaking time will certainly come for her also.)<br />There are better books to be savored on the relationship between a human and its feline owner. Offhand, I can name three: I &amp; CLAUDIUS by Clare De Vries, THE CAT WHO COVERED THE WORLD by Christopher Wren, and MY CAT SPIT MCGEE by Willie Morris.to be savored on the relationship between a human and its feline owner.

A few minutes later, a lone gunman kills Jane, the personal secretary to the British military attach&eacute; in Moscow, along with the British Ambassador to the USSR outside their hotel in Yalta. Holt, the latter's private secretary, sees it all, including a close-up view of the assassin's distinctively scarred face.<br />Comparing Holt's description of the murderer to a database of surveillance photos, MI6 in London identifies the killer as Palestinian fighter Abu Hamid. Since Jane was also the Secret Intelligence Service's agent in Moscow, the MI6 Director General recruits Holt to accompany Noah Crane, an Anglo-Jewish veteran sniper on loan from the Israeli Army, into Lebanon's dangerous Beqa'a Valley to exact vengeance. The plan is for Crane to shoot Hamid after Holt positively identifies him. Haunted by Jane's last words, \\"Don't be childish, Holt\\", the young and inexperienced Third Secretary in Her Majesty's Diplomatic Corps agrees.<br />AT CLOSE QUARTERS is another in a series of excellent covert action novels by Gerald Seymour whose writing embodies the best of John le Carr&eacute; and Adam Hall. Le Carr&eacute;'s spy stories emphasize the subtleties of character and plot development, while Hall's focus on the plot twists and close run things that bedevil his hero Quiller through many sagas. In this case, the character evolution is all Holt's as he's chaperoned by the crusty and non-communicative Crane into harm's way. Crane calls Holt \\"youngster\\", and instructs him, for survival's sake, to watch everything he does - and learn. It's OJT out on the sharp edge. In the meantime, the intelligence operatives of Syria, Israel and Great Britain are all conniving for better or worse in the background.<br />In most of the espionage or conspiracy thrillers I've read, the end is nice and tidy, and the hero walks away with the girl. There are no shades of gray in a world once again kept safe for democracy from the diabolical scheming of the Great Unwashed. What I like about Seymour's novels, AT CLOSE QUARTERS included, is that the winners are left almost as damaged as the losers, and the victories won have a certain hollowness.

And he's been fascinated by pirate stories all his life. Thus, in THE PYRATES, the reader is treated to what could serve as the script for the funniest, most outrageous buccaneer saga ever not put on film.<br />The hero of THE PYRATES is Captain Ben Avery, RN, the handsomest, most chivalrous, noblest, most incorruptible, bravest, most dutiful, and most unseducible man ever to wield an officer's sword on behalf of His Majesty. In Avery, as with every other of the novel's characters, Fraser has lovingly created a caricature. In any case, the time is \\"the old and golden days of England\\". King Charles occupies the throne. Ben is ordered to secretly convey a priceless crown to the King of Madagascar. On the same outbound ship are Admiral Lord Rooke and his gorgeous daughter Vanity. Of course, seafaring rascals capture the vessel, steal the crown, abandon Ben on a sandspit, and sell Vanity into white slavery. The tabloids (!) blame Avery for the debacle, and the remainder of the book has our superhero valiantly struggling to rescue honor, crown and Vanity from assorted scoundrels and near things. Of course, even the villains are occasionally endearing, especially if they're British, e.g. Colonel Blood, RA (Cashiered), a darker version of Avery without the ethics or meticulous dress code. And, needless to say, Captain Ben is besotted with Vanity, though his appreciation for her considerable charms is entirely platonic, anything more prurient unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.<br />Since a small movie plays in my mind whenever I read fiction, the chief delight of this swashbuckling caper is the way Fraser attaches period-piece incongruities to the plot which result in hilarious \\"sight gags\\" and other absurdities. Contemplate the following: laundry chutes in a Spanish galleon, meal-seating announcements aboard a pirate ship, buccaneers getting drunk and rowdy on captured Perrier, eau de cologne by the barrel or the handy bucket size, a pirate chief's stock portfolio, the deplorable lack of Kleenex in a fetid orlop prison, shipboard ruffians being entertained by a puppet show, pirate disability insurance, the limited number of headsets for men set adrift in small boats, threats of a horrible death by bicycle pump (?), or the French buccaneers' battle cry of \\"Remember Dien Bien Phu!\\" Imagine what Mel Brooks could do with this material!<br />THE PYRATES is about fifty pages too long. Those parts of the non-stop action that include the South American Indian tribe and the insanely evil Spanish Viceroy, Don Lardo, were unnecessary digressions better left on the cutting room floor. However, that minor flaw didn't prevent me from laughing out loud on several occasions, causing my wife to throw alarmed glances my way.

I have previously characterized Sophie Kinsella's first book in this series, CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC, as a rare comedic gem. This second book on the spending antics of Rebecca Bloomwood, SHOPAHOLIC TAKES MANHATTAN, is just as excellent. I'll be devastated if Kinsella isn't planning a third volume.<br />Becky is a 26-year old Brit who dispenses personal financial advice during a daily segment of a morning telly talk show. She's also under contract to a publisher to write a self-help book on the same subject. Unbeknownst to all except for her roommate Suze and her bank, Becky can't resist spending a pence to save her life. Even the most ordinary of tasks balloons into a spending orgy. For example, when sitting down at her computer to begin composing her promised book, she gets only several words into the very first sentence before she decides her chair is too uncomfortable. Careening off into an office supply store's website ...<br />\\"... I click on an ergonomic swivel chair upholstered in purple to match my iMac, plus a Dictaphone which translates stuff straight into your computer. And then I find myself adding a really cool steel claw which holds up notes while you're typing, a set of laminated presentation folders - which are bound to come in useful - and a mini paper shredder. Which is a complete essential because I don't want the whole world seeing my first drafts, do I?\\"<br />The title of this book indicates Becky is off to America. And so she is. With her boyfriend Luke, a PR genius determined to set up a Manhattan office. One of Becky's most endearing characteristics is that her worldview is so shallow. Contemplating life in the Big Apple ...<br />\\"The weird thing is that although I've never actually been to New York, I already feel an affinity toward it. Like for example, I adore sushi - and that was invented in New York, wasn't it? And I always watch Friends, unless I'm going out that night. And Cheers. (Except now I come to think of it, that's Boston. Still, it's the same thing, really.)\\"<br />Despite her faults, Becky is sweet, charming, kind-hearted, intelligent, ingenious, and is an excellent judge of character. There's not a malicious bone in her body despite what is thought by her bank's Overdraft Facilities Director. All this keeps the reader rooting for Becky no matter what financial and personal disasters she manages to engineer. Though I wouldn't want to be married to the lady just from financial self preservation, I wish I could number her among my friends just so I could be fascinated.Still, it's the same thing, really.)\\"<br />Despite her faults, Becky is sweet, charming, kind-hearted, intelligent, ingenious, and is an excellent judge of character.

For instance I recollect where I was when JFK was shot, when the Berlin Wall came down, and when the WTC towers were destroyed. On the other hand, I can't say the same about when John Lennon was shot or when Princess Di was killed. With millions of others worldwide, I remember that day in July 1969 when one of our species first set foot on another world and our planet figuratively held its breath to watch and listen. We shall not again see that degree of universal interest until, perhaps, there's a manned Mars mission. There were Armstrong and Aldrin on the Moon's surface, of course. But who was the guy left orbiting in the Command Module?<br />CARRYING THE FIRE is by Michael Collins, the poor devil left behind while his two colleagues rocketed off to most of the glory. In his book, Collins provides a narrative history of his time in the U.S. Air Force from his early days as a test pilot at the Edwards and Nellis test centers in the California desert, to his selection as a NASA astronaut (on his second application), to the training for and flight of Gemini 10, and finishing with Apollo 11 and the effects of that mission on his subsequent life.<br />CARRYING THE FIRE is a solid, relatively dead-pan, and competently written look at America's astronaut training and the experience of being \\"in space\\", or at least to the degree experienced by the author. Spending his adult life as an engineering test pilot, surely the most glamorous job for a techno-nerd type, it's to Michael's credit that he's penned a book as readable as this. During those later chapters in which he shares the Apollo 11 experience, the volume nearly becomes one that is difficult to put down. Not quite, but almost.<br />\\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind\\" has always struck me as one of the least inspiring famous lines ever spoken. Jeez, who wrote Armstrong's material? (It's so inane that I can't even find the full text of the statement in the edition of LIFE magazine issued to commemorate the event, so maybe I have it wrong.) I only mention this because what was very evident in Michael's narrative was the drabness of the non-technical communications among the Apollo 11 astronauts themselves and between them and Mission Control, as least as recorded for posterity by the author. Even the banter falls flat. Perhaps this is a factor of the no-nonsense, test pilot approach to business, or perhaps it was an effort by NASA to keep it appropriate for family listening. It didn't sound like our three heroes had much fun. To be fair, however, there is one photo in CARRYING THE FIRE captioned \\"Do you see what I see?\\" that perhaps gives evidence to a Collins sense of humor after all.<br />For anyone wishing to know more about that day almost 33 years ago - gosh, has it been that long? - when America stood taller and prouder than any day before or since, then I recommend this book.famous lines ever spoken.

So, in 1980, he took time off from studies at Amherst to play hobo and ride the rails through the western states, ostensibly gathering material for a senior anthropology thesis. Hopping a freight in St. Louis, he went by stages to Denver, Salt Lake City, Pocatello (Idaho), Havre (Montana), Fargo (North Dakota), Spokane, Seattle, Portland, Eugene (Oregon), Oroville (California), Elko (Nevada), Oakland, Bakersfield (California), Los Angeles, Yuma, El Paso, and back to Denver. Along the way, he meets and loosely befriends those that wander from one place to the next in search of food stamps, discarded edibles and a safe place to sleep - an autonomy and liberty gained at the sacrifice of loved ones, comfort, security, and the income from a steady 9 to 5. The most interesting was 50-year old Sheba, the rare female tramp, who'd built herself a multi-room shelter out of old tires.<br /><br />Conover is a talented writer who deftly captures the \\"romance\\" of the rails in ROLLING NOWHERE.<br /><br />About the scenery from a boxcar: \\"A twisting chasm of waterfalls, spillways, gray rock, and isolated scrub trees hanging on to the canyon walls for dear life, the Feather River Canyon was inaccessible by car, but ... spectacular by freight train.\\"<br /><br />About the grunge: \\"Forrest ... scratched his scalp vigorously and pulled out a small something. He flicked it away with distaste toward the other side of the tree where I slept.\\"<br /><br />About the food: \\"I ... shared ravenously in the fare: a bottle of cold white port, a small, dirty Baggie of lettuce, and two brown bananas.\\" But hey, the chow isn't all bad. Evidence gathered by Ted suggests that dumpster diving in back of KFCs after closing hour yields a feast of mashed potatoes and fried chicken. And I love fried chicken. (\\"Say, Hon, what are we doing for our wedding anniversary dinner?\\" Am I a romantic devil, or what?)<br /><br />The author's youthful idealism is evident at the book's conclusion when he preaches for fairer treatment of hoboes by the society through which they wander. They are, after all, victims of the system. This is several pages after he describes his welcome of a fellow traveler trying to climb aboard his moving boxcar uninvited: \\"He was about to leap in when I set my boot down on his fingers, hard. With a yelp, he disappeared.\\" A nice touch, don't you think?<br /><br />While reading ROLLING NOWHERE, I was struck by the author's almost complete lack of humor in describing a journey that should have afforded more opportunities for such. This is a serious piece written in a deadpan style. I wish Ted had lightened up some. There were also so many instances of deja vu that I soon realized that I'd read this book before - probably back in the early 80's when first published. I need to write myself a note that twice is more than enough such that I don't pick it up again two decades from now. Instead, maybe I can find a book about vacationing in the garbage dumps of Calcutta.e author's youthful idealism is evident at the book's conclusion when he preaches for fairer treatment of hoboes by the society through which they wander.

In A PAINTED HOUSE, Luke Chandler picks the stuff - real cotton that is. He lives on a farm in the Arkansas Delta with his parents and his father's parents, Pappy and Gran. Pappy rules the household - until Gran speaks. It's now September and there're 80 acres of King Cotton to harvest, for which job the Chandlers hire the Spruills, a poor family down from the \\"hill country\\", and10 Mexican migrant workers.<br />Set in the fall of 1952, A PAINTED HOUSE is a splendid period piece of that time and place. Its enthralling magic is that it's life seen through the eyes of 7-year old Luke, who spends five and a half days each week of the picking season under the hot Southern sun plucking the cotton bolls until his fingers bleed. In the evenings, he and the men folk listen to radio broadcasts of their beloved St. Louis Cardinals baseball team led by the great Stan Musial. On Saturday, there's the weekly bath and the afternoon movie matinee in the nearby settlement of Black Oak. Sunday is for churchgoing at the local Baptist house of worship.<br />Needless to say, this is a coming-of-age story, or a least the very beginning of one. To date, Luke's major worry has been for his 19-year old Uncle Ricky, his father's brother, off fighting in Korea. Now, his mind becomes preoccupied with things he's seen unbeknownst to his elders - two murders, a childbirth, and his first sight of a live and pretty, naked, young woman. Some things are best kept secret from adults, especially the last:<br />\\"If (the girl) caught me, she'd tell my father, who'd beat me until I couldn't walk. My mother would scold me for a week. Gran wouldn't speak to me, she'd be so hurt. Pappy would give me a tongue-lashing, but only for the benefit of the others. I'd be ruined.\\"<br />And, because of the dynamic that exists between parents and offspring, there's the keeping of secrets because:<br />\\"(Mother) told me many times that little boys shouldn't keep secrets from their mothers. But every time I confessed one, she was quick to shrug it off and tell my father what I'd told her. I'm not sure how I benefited from being so candid.\\"<br />A PAINTED HOUSE is not a \\"thriller\\" in the usual sense, but I couldn't put it down nonetheless. (I usually read two books at a time, one at home and one at work during my lunch breaks. I brought this novel home to temporarily shove aside the second book.) By the last page, I was strongly connected with the members of the Chandler clan and wished them well. Having said that, one of the book's shortcomings was author Grisham's failure to adequately describe the physical appearance of the Chandlers - I couldn't picture them in my mind's eye. Moreover, the storyline eventually concludes with too many loose ends. This begs for a sequel. But since that isn't Grisham's style, my curiosity shall likely remain unsatisfied.<br />Finally, that part of the plot dealing with an unpainted vs. painted house was unnecessary.

There's a tinge of unhealthiness about the author's humor that reminds me of the faint odor of sickness perceptible while walking down an otherwise spotless hospital corridor. Perhaps it's because David's wit is based on the shortcomings of others and/or his own poor self image. Quite often, his target is other family members.<br />About a sister: \\"Lisa couldn't be trained to scoot the food scraps off her soiled sheets, much less shake out the blanket and actually make the bed.\\"<br />About his father: \\"My mother had stopped listening to him years ago, but it was almost a comfort that my father insisted on business as usual, despite the circumstances (of his wife's cancer) ... He had made a commitment to make her life miserable, and no amount of sickness or bad fortune would sway him from that task.\\"<br />About himself: \\"The moment I realized I would be a homosexual for the rest of my life, I forced my brother and sisters to sign a contract swearing they'd never get married. ...My fear was that ... one by one they would abandon us until it was just me and my parents ...\\"<br />Sedaris characterizes his mother as a chain-smoker and an alcoholic; his father as one that ignores a daughter's terror when her first menstrual period begins even as they're attending a pro golf tournament. And family togetherness is the time they confront the mystery of which one in the group - parents, six children and grandmother - is substituting the bath linens for toilet paper.  However, it's not always about dysfunction. I did find it droll when one of David's sisters, a waitress, brings home on Christmas Eve a co-worker who's also a part-time prostitute. Ho, ho, ho!<br />There's more to NAKED than remembering warm familial fuzziness, as when Sedaris was off at college, on a cross-country bus ride, picking apples in Oregon, or visiting a nudist camp. Yet, the humor during these interludes follows much the same tenor - occasionally amusing, more often pitiable and sad, always joyless, and ultimately tiresome.<br />Is Sedaris a gifted writer? Yes, he is. And I'm giving NAKED three stars instead of two for his different perspective on life. But I don't think I'll buy any more of his books.off at college, on a cross-country bus ride, picking apples in Oregon, or visiting a nudist camp.

Mark Franklin is an authentic Westerner, his luggage containing Stetson, saddle, gun belt and two .44 Remington pistols.<br />I've been to England many times, and I love it. Unfortunately, my family's roots are not in the UK, nor have I had the longed-for opportunity to take up permanent residence there. In MR. AMERICAN, it's Franklin's great good luck to have made a fortune from a Nevada silver mine. This allows him to return to England in search of his roots - his forebears having immigrated to the Colonies hundreds of years before - and purchase the house, Manor Lancing, which dominates the Lincolnshire village of his ancestors, Castle Lancing.<br />I learned in English Lit 1A that every novel incorporates a conflict, which, in MR. AMERICAN, is subtle. To modern fiction readers, fed a steady diet of lurid murders-most-foul, global conspiracies, and courtroom duels, it may not seem like much of a conflict at all. Author George MacDonald Fraser, a Brit himself, has chosen to introduce into Edwardian society of pre- WWI England a rugged individualist matured in the late-19th century American West, and develop what happens. The WASP values that Franklin possesses from such a background - chivalry, self-reliance, forthrightness, loyalty, lack of class pretension, suspicion of authority - are occasionally at odds with the upper class social circle that soon adopts him.<br />For the reader, Mark will present as an appealing, stand-up fellow. The book is populated with interesting characters: Samson, Franklin's gentleman's gentleman; Pip, the effervescent West End stage actress; King Edward VII; Lady Helen Cessford, the militant suffragette; Peggy, the daughter of an impoverished country squire; Kid Curry, the unwelcome visitor from Franklin's ... um, shall we say, irregular past. And above all, there's the outrageous and aging rascal, General Harry Flashman, the hero of a whole other series of books by author Fraser.<br />I was undecided for a bit on the number of stars to award this novel - 3 or 4. At almost 600 pages, it isn't the type of book that keeps one riveted. The dramatic moments are occasional and of short duration, and there are a lot of loose ends that would have made an absorbing sequel inasmuch as the storyline ends in 1914 with the outbreak of the war. (Since MR. AMERICAN was published in 1981, no sequel has been written to my knowledge. Pity.) In the final reckoning, I gave it four stars because it's about an American who finds \\"home\\" and adventure of sorts in a green and pleasant land.

(Since MR. AMERICAN was published in 1981, no sequel has been written to my knowledge. Pity.) In the final reckoning, I gave it four stars because it's about an American who finds \\"home\\" and adventure of sorts in a green and pleasant land. I'm envious.	2002-04-10

Wow, talk about the potential for a nasty mood swing!<br />In MARS CROSSING, this is the dodgy predicament facing John Radkowski and his crew of five (Ryan, Tana, Estrella, Chamlong, and Trevor) in 2028. Their return vehicle, previously landed on Mars to robotically manufacture fuel from the planet's atmosphere for the trip back, didn't function as its instruments indicated. As a matter of fact, it's now just so much scrap metal. The only solution is to travel 4,000 miles to the polar cap and the landing site of the first Mars mission - Brazilian no less! - in 2020 whose crew mysteriously died on the surface. Their return vehicle is presumably still intact and ready to go. Trouble is, it only has room for two pilgrims.<br />I rarely read space sci-fi because the plots, ETs and technology are so exorbitantly far-fetched. I suspect life will be less fanciful, even in the far future. However, in MARS CROSSING, author Geoffrey Landis, a working NASA scientist, has crafted a solid tale around plausible new technology and the planetary knowledge gained from the Pathfinder and Mars Global Surveyor projects, both of which he was a part. Even the low key villains of the piece, for example the itchy life form that doomed the second Mars manned mission in 2022, are relatively mundane. (At least it wasn't Tinea cruris!)<br />I especially liked some aspects of the mission's technology, such as the Spectra 10 super-fiber rope, almost as thin as a spider's web, which can hold thousands of pounds, and the super-light Butterfly airplane. Pretty neat stuff!<br />I did find the composition of the crew slightly improbable. Estrella was the wife of the long-dead Brazilian mission commander. And Trevor's only reason for being there - talk about Dead Weight - was that he won the $1000 per ticket lottery that helped finance the cost of the expedition. Now, really! However, once I got over that credibility hiccup, I enjoyed this book very much and, since it is the author's first novel, much credit is due.lottery that helped finance the cost of the expedition.

I've been entertained in the past by compilations of such stories, some of which might perhaps stretch the credulity of those whose idea of a journey is flying to Phoenix to visit the mother-in-law or, at best, spending a couple of weeks on a package cruise of the Med. You know the kind of stories I mean: road warrior loses laptop to headhunters in the Amazon outback, spelunker falls into pit of bat guano in a remote Siberian cave. I mean, whom do you know does this stuff?<br />In this book, whether it's being seated on an international flight in front of someone secretly carrying an eye-wateringly stinky package - durian, in this case - or stupidly parking the car on the tram tracks in Brussels and bringing city traffic to a complete halt, I can relate without too much a stretch of the imagination. Then there's the story by the man whose experiences in a provincial Vietnamese hospital having sea urchin spines removed from his foot remind one of medieval torture. Or the one about having to chaperone \\"Ugly Californian\\" relatives through the backwaters of Central Europe. The first chapter relating a couple's encounters with various creepy-crawlers, including a scorpion found in a hanging shirt, during a trip to Costa Rica is particularly relevant to me because my wife wants to visit the country. (Oh, sweetie, come and read this!)<br />I won't pretend that all of these 43 stories are terrific. The monodrone - not a proper word, but it ought to be - by the college professor congratulating himself on having resisted the persistent sexual advances of a female student enrolled at the American University of Bulgaria was a piece of self-serving claptrap. And the one by the adventurer who decides to dribble a soccer ball across 15 miles of Colorado wilderness was simply contrived and silly. And a few more were just so-so.

The mystery of Earhart's fate has captured the public's imagination for decades. Did she perish when her plane hit the water? Was she captured by the Japanese and executed as a spy? Was she abducted by space aliens? Is she living in Idaho with Elvis?<br />The premise of Alison Anderson's novel HIDDEN LATITUDES, which is set in1979, is that Amelia has survived 42 years as a castaway on a tiny Pacific atoll, the last 40 alone. Then one day, a 35-foot sailboat, the \\"Stowaway\\", with husband Robin and wife Lucy aboard, anchors in the island's lagoon, her engine kaput and her hull reef damaged. Might this be Earhart's ride home?<br />In chapters that alternate between the \\"voice\\" of Amelia and those of her might-be rescuers, the author explores the loneliness that derives from complete isolation from the world as compared with that despairing aloneness which grips the partners in a failing marriage. Earhart has become so accustomed to solitary life on her little island that she hesitates to reveal her presence to Robin and Lucy, whose marital difficulties are only exacerbated by their present crisis. At 82, Amelia wonders what would be gained by returning to a world that would regard her as an historical curiosity, soon to become nothing but an aged crony. Being young and not realizing the value of what they have together, Robin and Lucy internally contemplate the possibility of separation once they get back to \\"civilization\\".<br />I liked HIDDEN LATITUDES insofar as the poignancy of Anderson's plot resides almost solely in the Earhart character as she \\"remembers\\" for the reader the significant events of her life since she and Fred lost their way, including two near-rescues snatched away early on by cruel Fate. To this extent, Anderson has crafted an imaginatively satisfying \\"what if\\" scenario. On the other hand, the Robin and Lucy characters become so caught up in their dysfunctional behavior while struggling to make their boat seaworthy that they approach dangerously close to becoming tiresome. They're so self-absorbed in their own bickering that they fail for too long to follow up on clues that another human is present on this \\"deserted\\" island. You want to yell at them, \\"Snap out of it. Look around you!\\"<br />At one point, Amelia sneaks a book from the \\"Stowaway\\":<br />\\"In my shelter there is a new treasure, a novel. ...I have taken it from them ... but I think if they could ever know the pleasure it will give me they would not mind. Dare I read it over and over, for the pleasure? As it happens I cannot read quickly. I am not used to letters on a page anymore. ... I read aloud, quietly; words and voice struggle together against neglect. Yet I can savor the words and pictures they convey. ... I am like a child, learning to read, learning the world I have forgotten.\\"<br />Perhaps more than anything else, Earhart yearns for the small things of life like jam, a scissors to cut her hair, a new pair of shorts, needle and thread.

Therefore, it was with more than a little giddy anticipation that I picked up Larry McMurtry's SACAGAWEA'S NICKNAME, a collection of his essays on the American West.<br />The twelve chapters in this short (178 pages) hardback cover diverse topics, the unifying thread being McMurtry's insight into what has shaped, for better or worse, the modern public's perception of our nation's frontier heritage. He does this by examining the influence of some well-known icons - Buffalo Bill, Annie Oakley, Zane Grey, Lewis and Clark, and Sacagawea - as well as some that are perhaps not so widely famous - authors Patricia Limerick and Janet Lewis, historian James Wilson, geologist John Wesley Powell, and anthropologists Frank Cushing and Matilda Stevenson.<br />Because of the great pleasure I've derived from McMurtry's novels, I looked forward to what I hoped would be a series of humorous, scintillatingly clever, and informative insights. It pains me to say that I found the volume as a whole to be like this review, somewhat lackluster. (It isn't one of my best.) His chapter on Buffalo Bill was rambling, and the one on the Zuni tribe and the anthropologists who studied it too esoteric. His criticism of Western pulpmeister Zane Grey so lacked definition that I can't say even now what McMurtry's objection to the former is except perhaps that he wasn't capable of editing his own prose (but left it to his wife). His essay on John Wesley Powell was positively boring. And, except that Janet Lewis is apparently one of McMurtry's favorite writers, I cannot fathom why the author included a chapter on her at all. Perhaps it's because she lives in the West. Only the chapters on the Lewis and Clark expedition, and the second to last that lends its title to the book, provided any return on my investment of time and money. Lastly, McMurtry's dry humor was all too infrequent, as in:<br />\\"... William Clark served as Thomas Jefferson's fashion eye, delivering copious reports on the dress of the various tribes the party met. In some cases the skimpier the female costumes, the more copious Clark's notes become ... quite a few of those wild western women seemed to run around half undressed.\\" Yeah, some of those nights on the prairie probably seemed awfully long.<br />Did you know that Sacagawea's nickname, coined possibly by Captain Clark, was ... well, you'll have to find out for yourself.

In THE END OF ENEMIES, Frank and Joe Hardy have grown up to become Briggs Tanner and Ian Cahil, two clean-cut, nobly heroic, ex-Special Forces types employed by a private firm that does top secret wet work for the U.S. government. (Plausible deniability for the President, you see.) In any case, Tanner and Cahil now have the opportunity to save the world, or at least the Eastern Mediterranean.<br /><br />This potboiler is a standard global conspiracy thriller involving leftover WWII munitions, a renegade Japanese industrialist, Arab terrorists, Syrian plotters, seduced damsels, the FBI, the Mossad, traitors, blackmail, the CIA, and a Doomsday plot. It's entertaining in a silly sort of way, much like the Impossible Missions Force movies starring Tom Cruise.<br /><br />I don't know. Maybe it's because I've read so many similar storylines that I've become jaded. In this case, my peevishness stems principally from the fact that all the characters, whether American, Canadian, British, Japanese, Israeli, Russian, Syrian or Palestinian, all \\"sound\\" like customers recruited by Central Casting out of a Seattle corner Starbucks and dressed up in costumes for day of play acting. (This is a failing of quite a few works of espionage fiction, not just this one.) Moreover, author Grant Blackwood is occasionally incredibly sloppy in the small details. I picked up on a few (and wonder how many more I missed). The page numbers refer to the paperback edition.<br /><br />1. A woman with a femur broken in five places - imagine the cast - is not going to be seen having \\"curled herself into a ball\\". (Page 77)<br />2. Except for the \\"scrambled eggs\\" on the visors of Commanders and above, the billed caps of American naval officers do not carry rank badges. (Page 238)<br />3. It seems highly improbable that an American fleet attack submarine on WWII patrol is going to have an Ensign, the lowest officer grade, as the Executive Officer, i.e. the second-in-command. (Page 1)<br /><br />OK, ok, ok - so I'm picky, picky, picky. This book admittedly has more elements that are positive than are negative, but the fact remains that it's no better than an average representative of the genre. Worse than that, the author is so busy tying up loose ends at the conclusion that the last 6 pages are patently ridiculous.<br /><br />If you want to read a novel that deals with Middle Eastern terrorism and is well crafted, as opposed to being slopped out any old way, then I would recommend John le Carr&eacute;'s [[ASIN:0143119745 The Little Drummer Girl: A Novel]] or Gerald Seymour's [[ASIN:B00J3793IQ A Line in the Sand]].ican fleet attack submarine on WWII patrol is going to have an Ensign, the lowest officer grade, as the Executive Officer, i.e. the second-in-command.

The RAG MAN is Mack, partner with Lars in a small garment manufacturing enterprise. Mack keeps the machinery running, while Lars is \\"the people guy\\" - the salesman. Lars is also the one who's just absconded to Mexico with the firm's funds and the statuesque blond bookkeeper, Rita. Left to deal with an empty payroll account, unfilled orders and snarling creditors, Mack is like a deer caught in the high beams. To Mack's wife, Paula, he's safe, honest, kind and utterly predictable. As she wistfully muses, why can't he stand up for himself, maybe \\"scare her a little\\"? As they say, one should be careful what is wished for.<br />Mack shortly returns from a visit to Mexico a radically changed man. As he aggressively retakes control of his tottering business from the bank, his complete personality about-face alters the lives of those most closely associated with him and the Lars fiasco: Paula, Rita, and the local gumshoe assigned to the criminal investigation of the embezzlement, Detective Pleasant.<br />The principal characters, even the top-heavy Rita, are ones we might meet in real life. (Well, eye-popping bimbos like Rita are regrettably missing from the social circles I inhabit.) Their problems could just as well be ours, and you'd think that would cause the reader to extend sympathy. But, as darker sides surface, maybe not. And is Mack's transformation by serendipitous events in Canc&uacute;n believable? Perhaps not. (Personally, I didn't think it was.) What I can say is that RAG MAN is an adequately entertaining work of dark humor that explores the repercussions and just desserts of actions taken (or not) without being particularly profound. With the proper casting and screen adaptation, it would make a wonderful, low budget film reminiscent of FARGO or A SIMPLE PLAN.<br />RAG MAN is a short tale that can be finished in a day, or 15 minutes if you're a speed-reader. Thus, if it falls short in your opinion, then little time has been invested. Then again, you may consider it a 5-star morality play.a 5-star morality play.	2002-03-03

While out in the woods on one of their annual hunting trips, they become enmeshed in a military operation, commanded by a psycho named Kurtz, to cordon off the site of a flying saucer crash and annihilate every living thing - human, animal or alien - in the quarantine zone. As the plot evolves, another character, Duddits, moves to center stage. Duddits is a middle-aged man whom our four heroes had befriended during their common adolescence after rescuing him from a gang of bullies. Besides being afflicted with Down's Syndrome, Duddits is a remarkable telepath.<br />My principal grumble with this book is that I expended too much time and attention on its 616 hard-backed pages for the degree of satisfaction I got for the effort. Roughly one-third of the book involves a vehicle pursuit - bad guys chase good guys chasing a good/bad guy - along the New England interstates. King uses this as an occasion for character and plot development. I just got fidgety. And while the author took the opportunity to demonstrate political correctness by making a mentally handicapped individual a hero, I never really warmed to the Duddits character. Also, since telepathy is at the core of the storyline, much of the \\"action\\" takes place in the players' minds, and I too often found it inadequately connected to the rest of the yarn.<br />The author does manage to create some chilling situations, e.g. the fate of the hapless McCarthy, the lost hunter who stumbles into our heroes' hunting cabin. In the true King tradition, his brand of horror is sometimes understated. I like that.<br />\\"Inside his lower intestine, in that rich dump of discarded food and worn-out dead cells, something for the first time opened its black eyes.\\" Oh-oh, it doesn't sound like something Maalox will fix.<br />Die-hard King fans will perhaps rate this book much higher than I have.

Above all, DIVIDED BY A COMMON LANGUAGE is a book primarily of lists. So, it's probably not one you'll actually read from cover to cover unless you're an Anglophile like me.<br />This volume by Chris Davies is not very long at 194 paperbacked pages. In roughly the first third, Chris writes short commentaries on a number of topics that serve to illustrate the differences in language and life styles between the US and UK: tips for the tourist (airport, hotel), practical information (automobiles, gas/petrol), technical information (plumbing, electricity), institutions/services (postal system, banks, currency, restaurants, bars, museums, theaters, school, government, shops, food, clothing), customs and etiquette, driving terminology (roads, road terms), punctuation, spelling, and idioms and expressions. These topics are sometimes accompanied by short lists of terms, provided in US and UK equivalents, to further illustrate whatever point he's making. Within a single topic, as under \\"customs and etiquette\\", his choice of sub-topics seems rather eclectic: phone manners, common conversational courtesy, church attendance, drive-ins and drive-throughs, utility bills, valet parking, window screens, air-conditioning, soda fountains, healthcare, sports, folklore monsters, and public and legal holidays.<br />The majority of the book's pages comprise two long lists: a British-American lexicon, and an American-British lexicon.<br />I suppose DIVIDED BY A COMMON LANGUAGE has a practical use, especially if you're a Yank visiting England for the first time, or a Brit going the other way, and you prefer to learn from printed material. I might have used such a reference before the first of my dozen trips across The Pond. (However, I'd rather learn by just immersing myself in the experience of being there.) For me, the principal merit of this book lies in its entertainment value, and the sheer delight of having my memories of England stimulated by the words and expressions one encounters there. Some of my favorites are: catseyes (reflecting highway lane markers), ice lolly (popsicle), full stop (period), dodgy (risky), crisps (potato chips), elevenses (morning tea break), plonk (cheap wine), The Tube (London subway), have a natter (shoot the breeze), bang on (right on), pull your socks up (try harder), spend a penny (use the bathroom), and wonky (unstable).[....]So, take a recce on (check out) this book.

While Dad and I plinked paper targets, discarded bottles and rusty cans, Mom would wander off, hopefully out of the line of fire, to hunt wildflowers. After littering the desert with expended shells and disturbing the quiet with gunshots, I remember hearing the rattle of the desert shrubs in the wind and the scuttle of unseen small animals on the desert floor. It was an extraordinarily peaceful place. (Hey, who says I wasn't a sensitive child?)<br />Before reading THE MOJAVE, I thought that desert a relatively small area northeast of Los Angeles extending to Needles and the Colorado River. I was surprised to learn that it also stretches into western Arizona and as far north as the southern tip of Utah, and encompasses southern Nevada and such places as Death Valley, Las Vegas, and Hoover Dam. Indeed, David Darlington's book provides a wealth of information about this big \\"empty\\" place. After an opening chapter on that definitive symbol of this desert, the Joshua Tree, Darlington explores such diverse places and topics as a seventy-mile stretch of old Route 66, the space shuttle landing area at Edwards Air Force Base, the desert as a convenient hiding place for dead bodies and illegal drug labs, and a history of area mining from the first pick-and-shovel prospectors to today's international conglomerates. As a self-proclaimed conscientious objector, the author describes, but isn't thrilled about, the military's use of the region, from Patton's Desert Training Center during WWII, to modern day's Fort Irwin National Training Center (for Army infantry maneuvers) and the Nevada Test Site (for nuclear weapons). And, on a less apocalyptic note, he describes cattle ranching and the life of the desert tortoise, and reveals Giant Rock as a mecca for UFO and ET True Believers.<br />Most of what THE MOJAVE imparts to the reader is truly fascinating and informative, so I was initially tempted to give it at least a 4-star rating. However, the final chapter is a tediously long - 91 of the volume's 314 pages - narrative history of the conflicts arising from desert land (ab)use, such as urban over-expansion (in Las Vegas) and the recreational use of off-road vehicles, epitomized by the on-again, off-again and much fought over Barstow to Vegas ORV race. Darlington's hot button seems to be the fate of the endangered desert tortoise, about which he apparently cares a lot (though tries not to be obvious about it). But it was way much more than I needed to know, especially when the author bored me to tears with the escapades of the Phantom Duck, the nemesis of the Fed's Bureau of Land Management. And, because the author apparently disapproves of the manner in which the Mojave is being utilized by the military, Big Mining, and greedy land developers, the tone of the book is unnecessarily humorless. Gee, Dave, I wish you could've lightened up more - the Earth continues to spin.st of what THE MOJAVE imparts to the reader is truly fascinating and informative, so I was initially tempted to give it at least a 4-star rating.

There's Dr. Janeway, of course, a forty-something minister up to something vague and possibly sinister in Cambridge, MA. There are also Miriam, Irwin, Leon, Glen, Ethan, Nancy, Jean and Rabbi Perleman, all of whom, as a group, further the storyline by contributing inane dialog and actions that do nothing more than pad the length of the book.

I must admit that I wrote this book because of it.\\" Thus begins Fred Anderson's prodigious study of the effects of the Seven Years' War, and its immediate aftermath, on the prospects for the British Empire in North America.<br />Roughly the first half deals mainly with the military conflicts of the Seven Years' War that involved Great Britain, Spain, Austria, Prussia and Russia, and focuses primarily (because the title says \\"British North America\\") on the French and Indian War, which is the term used in United States history to differentiate the North American theater of the conflict from the whole. Anderson never states the obvious, which is the fact that, compared to the size of the European battles measured by numbers of deaths and troops involved, the North American \\"battles\\" were hardly more than mere scuffles. However, while the European clashes resulted in nothing more than a maintenance of the continental pre-war status quo, those across the Pond cost France her North American holdings, and transformed Britain into the world-class empire that the term \\"Britannia\\" brings to mind. In describing the North American confrontations, Anderson spans the period from 1754, when an inexperienced Lieutenant Colonel George Washington got ensnared in a massacre of French regulars at Jumonville's Glen, to 1760, when Anglo and Colonial forces captured Quebec and Montreal.  Perspective is maintained with frequent digressions to the seesaw war in Europe and the policy endeavors of kings George II and III and their chief ministers, among whom William Pitt and George Grenville predominated.<br />I particularly enjoyed Anderson's perspective of General Wolfe's startling conquest of Quebec. Some might criticize this as unsupported revisionism. However, in the absence of any conclusive facts to indicate the contrary, a certain zest is added to the military debate. And, in the final reckoning, what difference does it make?<br />Beginning the volume's second half, it's 1763, the war has ended, the treaties of Paris and Hubertusburg have been signed, and the British government is casting about for ways to make its new empire, and especially the American colonies, pay for the mother country's support. Thus, Parliament commences passing those measures that put the unrepresented colonists in a snit, and which are the starting point for most literary examinations of the Revolutionary Period: the American Duties (Sugar) Act, the Stamp Act, the Currency Act, and the Quartering Act. Anderson's well taken point - indeed, the working hypothesis of his whole book - is that the Colonies' ultimate ungrateful, Bad Attitude had its genesis not beginning in 1763, but in 1754. Simply put, the Seven Years' War forced the Colonies and the Mother Country to make common cause, and this familiarity became the breeding ground for future disenchantments.<br />To achieve the author's intent quoted at the beginning of this review, it's almost a given that his narrative would have to be a relative overview uncluttered by the detailed minutiae demanded by some hardboiled historians. Perhaps the two goals are incompatible. Indeed, I may have learned more than I ever wanted to know about the disastrous Stamp Act. However, while the author could have paraphrased with more brevity this and certain other aspects of the North American historical record - the activities of individual Indian chiefs, the internal squabbles of the various colonial governments, the greedy plots of land speculators - he did, in my opinion, admirably achieve his design. Certainly, THE CRUCIBLE OF WAR is long enough. Indeed, because it's a sober work based on extensive research and not a thriller, it took me almost eight weeks of evening reading on the couch to digest its 746 pages. However, I remained interested from beginning to end, and never got bogged down. Anderson's book is a fine historical composition for anyone interested in the period.<br />Lastly, I want to quote Anderson's delightful characterization of the sixty-year old Benjamin Franklin when the latter testified before the British Parliament in 1766 against the Stamp Act:<br />\\"... he danced through the interrogation like a cocky teenager waltzing down Philadelphia's Market Street with a Dutch dollar in his pocket and a great puffy roll tucked under each arm.\\" I loved it!sted from beginning to end, and never got bogged down.

Within several years, even though we were still engaged in a Cold War with the USSR, one couldn't help but feel some small degree of sympathy for the poor devils. After all, we'd recently been there and done that, so to speak.<br /><br />In THE HIDDEN WAR, Artyom Borovik, a journalist for the Russian magazine Ogonyok, recollects his experiences during two visits to the Afghan mess in 1987 and early 1989. During the former, Soviet forces were still fighting as if they could win. By the latter, the Kremlin had thrown in the towel and was withdrawing its troops towards the country's northern border and a February 15 exit deadline. And why was the USSR there in the first place? According to Borovik, one of the reasons was Brezhnev's fear that American troops were poised to invade the Union's soft underbelly through Afghanistan. (And is that so wild-eyed a view? After all, hadn't the U.S. been in Vietnam to forestall the \\"domino effect\\", whereby the fall of South Vietnam to the Red Menace would eventually lead to jackbooted commie hordes goose-stepping down the center line of Main Street, U.S.A.? And similarly, if one goes back further to the 19th century, Great Britain tried to dominate Afghanistan fearing Russia would otherwise use the country as an avenue to encroach upon India.)<br /><br />For me, the principal value of THE HIDDEN WAR was to see the conflict from the other side, albeit belatedly. My perceptions of the war at the time were mediated by on-the-spot reports from scruffy American TV-news personalities scrambling around the Afghan badlands with the mujahadin. (However, as Artyom points out, those ragtag fighters had American Stingers.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, because Borovik's book is apparently a series of stitched-together magazine articles, the text lacks seamless continuity, i.e. the author hops around a lot for his interviews - from Afghanistan, to New York, to London, to Afghanistan, to San Francisco, and back to Afghanistan again. The only unifying theme is that the 1979-1989 invasion was a complete boondoggle. The point is well taken, but more continuity of place would have been nice. And there was surprisingly little reporting from actual live-fire engagements between the two sides.<br /><br />Despite my reservations concerning Artyom's style, I'm glad I read his book. He successfully conveys the notion that Afghanistan is a wretched place to fight a war even insofar as the little things:<br /><br />\\"In Afghanistan, thirst can actually make you stoop to drink from a puddle of camel urine. (Every Soviet solder, in fact, carries a miniature water-purification device for just such an eventuality.)\\"<br /><br />American forces have recently been, and still are, engaged in Afghanistan against the Taliban.

Of the 21 men aboard, only a handful would return.<br />Nathaniel Philbrick's IN THE HEART OF THE SEA exceeded my expectations. His historical narrative begins as a treatise on whaleships and the business of whaling. Indeed, killing and cutting apart a whale is so ungentle an art that Greenpeace activists are likely to punch the air and exclaim \\"Yes!\\" when the Essex is rammed and sunk by a sperm whale on November 20, 1820 far out in Watery Nowhere. The book then becomes a gritty survival story replete with an examination of the stages of dehydration and starvation, a brief history of cannibalism among disaster survivors, and commentary on the essence of successful command leadership under dire straits.<br />As Philbrick is careful to point out early on, the ESSEX survivors sailed in open lifeboats 500 miles further than Captain Bligh of the HMS BOUNTY after being set adrift my mutineers, and three times further than Ernest Shackleton of the ice-crushed HMS ENDURANCE on his celebrated passage to South Georgia Island. IN THE HEART OF THE SEA is an amazing tale deftly recreated by the author from primary sources. I was loath to put it down even for such necessary activities as sleeping and going to work.<br />After a story such as this, one gains a new respect for those that went down to the sea in wooden, sailing ships. And, should someone invite me out for no more than an afternoon of simple whale watching just off the coast, I'll be sure and pack my water wings.	2002-01-26

The book's thirty chapters span the period from 1975, when Sterling was a naval weapons specialist aboard the U.S. cruiser Oklahoma City sailing Vietnamese coastal waters, to roughly the present. Virtually all take place in Southeast Asia, or Africa, or Baja California, and almost all center around an unforgettable meal or memorable woman. A Real Man's needs are pretty basic.<br />I think my favorite tale was that of the time when Richard, gripped tight in the misery of nicotine withdrawal, was part of the ship's detail assigned the task of transferring nuclear warheads from the deepest hold of the Oklahoma City to a munitions ship steaming alongside in seas made turbulent by a nearby storm. In other chapters, he's trolling for pickpockets in Saigon, or searching for a legendary (and possibly mythical) hooker in Olongopo City, or arm wrestling a local tough guy in the Burmese jungle, or watching a mob beat up a thief alongside his lunch table in Nairobi. And speaking of food, some of his meals are in the Yuk! category: roosters' gonads (with garlic) in Saigon, fish topped with crumbled red ants in Borneo. I guess one must take what one finds in the absence of better fare, or at least a McDonald's, but, jeez, Sterling actually seems to enjoy it.<br />I have my favorite armchair travel guides: Bill Bryson, Peter Mayle, Eric Newby. However, I can't recall a work by any travel essayist that better captures the pure essence of adventure driven by curiosity and sheer gutsiness like THE FIRE NEVER DIES. I certainly wouldn't have the pluck to eat deep fried potato bugs on the banks of the Mekong, but Sterling did, and I admire his style. The only reason I'm not awarding 5 stars is because he spent an inordinate amount of time in Baja California, an area too geographically near to my world and too historically uninteresting to be personally appealing. Richard, beyond that, I salute you with a tip of my Indiana Jones hat.ount of time in Baja California, an area too geographically near to my world and too historically uninteresting to be personally appealing.

Though the book doesn't indicate a time and locale for the storyline, it apparently takes place in a Colombian coastal town between, say, 1890 and 1950. During that period, Ariza's two opportunities to win the love of Fermina are separated by the latter's 50-year marriage to Dr. Juvenal Urbino.<br />I must say up front that I think this novel will be better appreciated by female readers. However, I'm giving it 5 stars, not because my testosterone level is necessarily low, but because I myself enjoy stringing words together, and author Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez is a master par excellence of that talent. I especially liked his technique of stating a relatively simple fact, and then telling in glorious detail how it got that way. For instance, within the first few pages he relates that Urbino's talking parrot escaped to the backyard mango tree, then dedicates 5 full pages of text to the background of the calamity. And, after Daza makes the statement that heads this review, the next 225 pages to the paths the three principal characters travel to arrive at that point. Throughout the narrative, Gabriel's prose is lush, flowery, and richly detailed, and credit must be given to the translator, Edith Grossman.<br />The vast majority of the text is devoted to the Urbinal-Daza marriage, which, I suspect, follows the same evolutionary course as many others in real life, and a number of other, more transient or transitional love relationships. Regarding the bonds that tie a man and woman together, I venture that M&aacute;rquez is a wise observer, as indicated by the following excerpts:<br />\\"After their first encounters they had both lost awareness of their ages, and they treated each other with the familiarity of a husband and wife who had hidden so many things in this life that there was almost nothing left for them to say to each other.\\"<br />And an observation by Daza: \\"It is incredible how one can be happy for so many years in the midst of so many squabbles, so many problems ... and not really know if it was love or not.\\"<br />LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA is the splendid creation of one of the twentieth century's most gifted writers.irst encounters they had both lost awareness of their ages, and they treated each other with the familiarity of a husband and wife who had hidden so many things in this life that there was almost nothing left for them to say to each other.\\"<br />And an observation by Daza: \\"It is incredible how one can be happy for so many years in the midst of so many squabbles, so many problems ... and not really know if it was love or not.\\"<br />LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA is the splendid creation of one of the twentieth century's most gifted writers.	2002-01-05

Recently, I read FLINT starring Scotland Yard Inspector Grace Flint, rehabilitating on the job after a horrific beating. Now, in DEMOLITION ANGEL, we have Carol Starkey, an LAPD detective assigned to head the investigation into the killing of a department bomb disposal technician. Carol used to be one of those herself until she was killed along with her partner-lover by a device that went boom. Paramedics brought her back to life, but not her colleague. Now she subsists on gin, cigarettes, Tagamet and psychotherapy, bears terrible mid-body scars, and carries a chip on her shoulder so big it looks like a cross.<br />The book begins with the death of Charlie Riggio as he peers into a bag containing a sophisticated pipe bomb. Reconstruction of the device afterwards points to a serial killer named \\"Mr. Red\\", whose profession is assassination by demolition, and whose hobby is bushwhacking bomb disposal experts. Trouble is, Mr. Red, John Michael Fowles, is introduced to the reader almost from the start, and he didn't do it. So who did? And what is Jack Pell's interest? Jack is down from the Fed's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, suffers debilitating headaches, and is carrying some pretty heavy baggage of his own.<br />DEMOLITION ANGEL is a page-turner from the very first detonation. Starkey, like Grace of FLINT, is an intriguing persona, though significantly more hard-edged than the latter. And author Robert Crais provides enough plot twists to keep things interesting. However, I can't bring myself to award 5 stars for a couple reasons. First, blast survivor Carol is so self-pitying and self-destructive that her evolving relationship with Pell is a plot device that seems a bit forced. Perhaps Crais would have been better advised to carry the two over into a second novel and let things simmer a bit. Secondly, though obviously not the sort you'd want marrying your only daughter, Mr. Red never achieves that level of psychopathic evil worthy of an Anthony Hopkins role in the film version. At times, Fowles seems not much more than a mischievous prankster.<br />DEMOLITION ANGEL is the perfect thriller for taking on that otherwise interminable plane flight, or aboard the cruise ship for those slow moments between buffets.r only daughter, Mr. Red never achieves that level of psychopathic evil worthy of an Anthony Hopkins role in the film version.

The main character, a Brit named Rebecca, was engagingly endearing as she shopped and spent way beyond her means and into one tight and/or ridiculous predicament after another. In CAT'S MEOW by Melissa de la Cruz, the main character, a New Yorker named Cat McAllister, lives according to the same spendthrift modus operandi overlaid with a bratty, self-centered shallowness and monumental snootiness. (If you remember the TV series NEWHART of the 1980s, recall the spoiled and vain Stephanie Vanderkellen role played marvelously by Julia Duffy. Cat is another Stephanie, and then some.)<br />Cat is a former Hollywood child star, now almost forgotten, who lives solely on the trust fund set up by her deceased Dad. Without gainful employment, she spends her time and inherited money in ceaseless and ultimately futile efforts to be trendy, fashionable, and seen with the Big Apple's Beautiful People, and be noticed by high society columnists. Cat's best friend is a sex-changed male now calling herself India. Her nemesis is another social climber, former friend Teeny Van der Hominie, who effortlessly manages to be everything that Cat aspires to be but isn't. Cat's goal is to marry Prince Stephan of Westonia, reputedly the heir to some little known central European pocket state, who will rescue her from penury and social obscurity.<br />I can't deny that CAT'S MEOW is amusing. It occasionally is, and for that reason I reluctantly toss it three barely flickering stars. However, McAllister is positively annoying. Since de la Cruz is heavily involved with the New York fashion \\"scene\\", I gather that her novel was written to be a satire. However, that doesn't mean the author can't or shouldn't make her primary character at least nominally likeable. Instead, Cat comes across as gratingly insufferable. If I was unfortunate enough to know such a woman in real life, I'd immediately relegate her in my mind to the useless margin of humanity. As for the book itself, I found myself at the end hurrying to finish so I could get on to something more substantive and worthwhile.<br />At one point Cat is forced to look for a real job. Without any qualifications whatsoever, she brazenly applies with Conde Nast publications for a fashion editor position.<br />\\"I took the famous Conde Nast elevators and prepared myself for the infamous elevator stare down between competing editrixes, but only found myself next to a slovenly maintenance man.

As such, it's an engrossing novel by plot-meister Gerald Seymour.<br />Brit Gavin Hughes was once a salesman selling illicit industrial mixing equipment to the Iranians for the latter's use in making weapons of mass destruction at a top-secret base. Then MI6 caught on, and put the squeeze on Hughes to become an informant. Gavin's information eventually allowed the Mossad to deal a crippling blow to Iran's WMD program. For his own protection, MI6 gives Gavin a new identity and life. He's now Frank Perry living with his wife Meryl and foster son Stephen in an isolated village on the Suffolk coast. The thing is, you see, a Saudi raid on an isolated terrorist camp yields evidence that the Iranians have discovered Gavin's identity and are sending in their master assassin, the Anvil, to make the hit. The British Security Service (MI5) now has jurisdiction, and pleads with Frank to run once more, but he adamantly refuses. Thus, an odd lot of players are converging on the village, its inhabitants, and the Perrys: the Anvil, the assassin's local accomplice previously converted to Islam, MI5, Scotland Yard, the SAS, an FBI anti-terrorist specialist, a sullen Scottish tracker and his dogs, a former British diplomat and his scarred foreign-born wife (the latter a survivor of Chile's torture chambers), and an injured marsh harrier - a migratory bird of prey.<br />One of my pet peeves with some &quot;highly acclaimed&quot; writers is that they impart no individuality to the principal characters of their books. The British government minister, the Yank CIA officer, the South American drug king, and the Tokyo police detective all talk and act as if they're cut from the same cloth, which might as well be that of an insurance broker in Des Moines. Seymour, on the other hand, makes each individual unique and real. This talent can make up for other faults.  However, A LINE IN THE SAND is not deficient by any standard to which I hold. It's a taut, smart, finely crafted thriller that should encourage the reader to investigate Seymour's other works.

By default, her work contains considerably more biographical information about kings Louis VII, Henry II, Richard I (the Lionheart, of England) and John I (of England) than Eleanor herself, but that isn't the author's fault. Writers of the period were more concerned about the doings of kings than those of their queens, the latter being traditionally considered not much more than the incubators for male heirs to the throne. However, because of her reliance on contemporary sources, Alison is able to effectively argue against such present-day notions as Richard the Lionheart's presumed homosexuality and Queen Eleanor's rumored murder of Henry II's mistress, Rosamund de Clifford (&quot;Fair Rosamund&quot;).<br />One of the volume's especially helpful features is a series of eight tables that illustrate the genealogies of the French Capetian kings, the English Plantagenet kings, the Dukes of Aquitaine, and the House of Anjou during the period, plus the relationship of Eleanor to all of them. These tables are of immense value in keeping the players straight. There's also a (disappointingly) short section of photographs.<br />In the back of the book, there's a 4-page interview with the author in which she makes favorable comments about the 1960s films BECKET and THE LION IN WINTER, both starring Peter O'Toole as King Henry II. She observes that both are &quot;legitimate treatments of their subjects, if not in the letter, certainly in the spirit.&quot; I found this personally gratifying since the latter film, ostensibly depicting the infighting between Henry, Eleanor and their three sons (Richard, Geoffrey, and John) at Henry's Christmas court at his castle of Chinon in 1183, is my all-time favorite movie about the all-time dysfunctional family.<br />Not only was Eleanor the consort and Queen of two kings, and the mother of two more (Richard and John), but she also gave birth to two queens, Eleanor of Castille and Joanna of Sicily, and numbered among her direct descendents all English kings to the year 1485, plus several other non-English kings and queens, the odd saint or two, and one Holy Roman Emperor. Her life and accomplishments, even while living in the shadow of the great Henry II, make other female British rulers, e.g. Elizabeth I, Victoria, and Margaret Thatcher, seem like shrinking violets in comparison.<br />Occasionally, one is presented with the question, &quot;If given the chance, what one great person in history would you invite over for dinner?&quot; My choice would be Eleanor of Aquitaine, a source of endless fascination.epicting the infighting between Henry, Eleanor and their three sons (Richard, Geoffrey, and John) at Henry's Christmas court at his castle of Chinon in 1183, is my all-time favorite movie about the all-time dysfunctional family.<br />Not only was Eleanor the consort and Queen of two kings, and the mother of two more (Richard and John), but she also gave birth to two queens, Eleanor of Castille and Joanna of Sicily, and numbered among her direct descendents all English kings to the year 1485, plus several other non-English kings and queens, the odd saint or two, and one Holy Roman Emperor.

In these, the author remembers growing up in the West Virginia coal town of Coalwood in the late 1950s. From the moment he saw the first Soviet Sputnik traverse the night sky in 1957, Homer became obsessed with space, rockets and his hero, Werner von Braun. Along with several high school chums, Hickam built and, after some initial failures, launched several dozen rockets. As high school seniors, the group won a national science fair for their achievements in rocketry.<br />In THE COALWOOD WAY, Homer expands on that period during his final high school year when he was steadily improving the design and performance of his missiles, but before he won the national competition that was the culminating triumph of his first book. This second volume of memoirs focuses less on rocketry than the other challenges Hickam faced in his hometown and personal life. His father, the mine superintendent, is a stern workaholic who demonstrates little overt love for his second son (while being more lavish with his firstborn, Jim). His mother, Elsie, is increasingly disenchanted with her marriage and life in Coalwood, and wants to move to Florida to sell real estate. Miners are being laid off by the parent company, an Ohio steel manufacturer. Families are going hungry. There's talk of a strike. Homer is driven to get all A's in school to be able to escape his environment, go to college, and ultimately work at Cape Canaveral. And, of course, there's the distraction of girls, and deciding whom to take to the Christmas Formal. After all, Melba June did sidle up close and say in a throaty voice, \\"I just love your rockets.\\"<br />That THE COALWOOD WAY is less inspiring then its predecessor, and that Hollywood is unlikely to consider it material for the silver screen, shouldn't detract from the fact that it's a poignant coming-of-age story with an attractive hero. Delightfully, the author can be occasionally humorous in a homespun sort of way, as when he observes of preachers:<br />\\"Did failure to volunteer information count as a lie? I didn't think it did though I wouldn't have wanted to put that question to a preacher. It was my experience that preachers could get snagged on the details and miss the big picture entirely.\\"<br />Perhaps my favorite character in the whole book is Elsie.

The HOUSE OF GOD was originally published in the 1970's when it was relatively more fashionable to throw eggs at anything that was \\"establishment\\". In this darkly humorous novel, the target is the U.S. medical profession - specifically, the training young physicians receive at the beginning of their careers.<br />We follow the education of Dr. Roy Basch during the year of his hospital internship in the HOUSE OF GOD after graduating from the Best Medical School. Almost immediately, he's introduced to the patient population that will be his nemesis - the Gomers (the acronym for Get Out of My Emergency Room). Gomers are geriatric, mentally disoriented, chronically ill, debilitated adults who get no better, yet never manage to die on their own. Dr. Roy can choose as a role model either the Fat Man or Jo, two second-year doctor-trainees (\\"residents\\"). The Fat Man's philosophy is to do nothing to treat the Gomers, while Jo will attempt every heroic procedure in the book. Paradoxically, Gomers get better, or at least remain stable, under the former regimen, but get worse and die under the latter. At the other end of the patient scale are those relatively young admissions that die tragically no matter what. After several months of experiencing this and exposure to the incompetence and/or mercenary greed of the private physicians on the hospital staff, Basch is sustained in this psychologically and professionally crushing environment only by the sex he has with Nurse Molly. Then, even that isn't enough, and Roy alienates his friends by becoming withdrawn, sarcastic, and obnoxious. Can our hero, all idealism now lost, be saved before he drops out or commits suicide?<br />Since the HOUSE OF GOD was authored by a physician, Samuel Shem, I give him the benefit of the doubt that his description of the dehumanizing experience that is a medical internship in a large, urban medical center is at least partly accurate. And, it is humorous, at least until the reader realizes that each one of us is a potential Gomer, at which point the plot becomes less cause for chuckles. God forbid that we should become victims of such medical malpractice as found within these pages.<br />The greatest failing of this novel in the year 2001 is that it's dated. In this age of AIDS, I would doubt that `terns\\" are nowadays as promiscuous as depicted. And, since many physicians are now not much more than salaried drones for the HMOs, the egotism of the medical profession as a whole is not quite the balloon to be popped that it once was.<br />As an alternative to Shem's novel, I would recommend the 1971 cinematic black comedy THE HOSPITAL, starring George C. Scott, since it touches on much the same themes. Scott is at his very best, and the movie can be viewed more quickly than this book can be read.  At 420 pages, the latter got a little tiresome.one of us is a potential Gomer, at which point the plot becomes less cause for chuckles.

Today's urban legends will become the future's fairy tales.<br />TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE is an assemblage of over 200 such stories gathered by Jan Brunvand, who is an expert, perhaps obsessively so, on the subject. They cover a wide range of source topics: pets, criminals, cars, sex, accidents, babies, work, technology, human nature, mistaken ID, academia, food, the supernatural, wild animals, and more. They inspire laughter, horror, disbelief, or just plain \\"Oh, yuck!\\" Each story is followed by a paragraph, sometimes lengthy, on the times and places the anecdote, or some variant of it, has appeared. Some go back to the 19th century. After the first twenty-five or so, I decided to leave this last bit to the truly compulsive.<br />My favorite was the one about the American couple staying at the Moscow hotel during the bad old Soviet era. Obsessed with the possible presence of listening devices, the couple searched the room for \\"bugs\\". Finding only a metal plate under the carpet, they removed the screws from it. The next morning on checkout, the desk manager asked if they'd spent a pleasant night. He was concerned since the couple in the room below our intrepid travelers had the chandelier fall on them. My wife said she's never seen me laugh so hard.<br />The trouble with these stories is that they have no developing plot, no hero to love, and no villain to hate. Like eating popcorn, the experience, however delightful, ends with the last kernel/paragraph. Nobody ever exclaims, \\"Wow, I had a great bag of popcorn last week!\\" Similarly, I doubt this book will stay memorable for more than a minute. As a bathroom diversion for those contemplative moments, it stands out. Otherwise, it's light reading with a capital \\"L\\".	2001-11-10

If you piled all this gold in one solid cube, you could fit it aboard any of today's great oil tankers; its total weight would amount to approximately 125,000 tons ...\\"<br />So writes Peter Bernstein in the prologue of THE POWER OF GOLD. (Uh-oh. If I want to corner the bullion market, I'd better get a bigger safe deposit box.) This volume is a highly readable history of the element Au from the reign of King Midas to the present, and from gold's status as a commodity, as money, as a monetary standard, and back to commodity again. To the hardboiled bean counter, Bernstein's work might seem superficial. Well, since I never claim to be a deep thinker, and am relatively indifferent to the state of the world economy and the pretentious pronouncements about it made by financial experts on the morning talk show circuit, it proved to be an entertaining and educational read.<br />The author guides us down the Golden Brick Road from the times of the ancient Greeks, Egyptians, and Chinese, to Rome and Byzantium, further along to the Black Death-ravaged Middle Ages, on to the empires of the English and Spanish, and finally to the recently-past obsessions of the British, American and French governments. And, while THE POWER OF GOLD describes the element in all its guises - adornment, coinage, spoil of war, power display, horde in a sock - the book is, above all, a fine treatise on economics.<br />My only quarrel with Bernstein is that he sometimes rambles off on tangents not really germane to the topic. It's enough to know that Spain plundered the gold from the Inca Empire, transporting it back to Europe on its treasure galleons. The author's account of Francisco Pizarro's treacherous capture and murder of the Inca king was nice background, but not essential. Similarly, it's enough to know that the 19th century gold strikes in California, Alaska, Russia, South Africa and Australia destabilized the world's supply of the metal, but I didn't require Johann Sutter's sob story to appreciate the fact. Thankfully, Bernstein gave no background on President Richard Nixon, whose momentous 1971 decision to remove the U.S. $ from the gold standard seems forgotten in the glare of his China policy and Watergate.<br />As I sit contemplating my few British sovereigns and South African krugerrands losing value in my tiny safe deposit box, I think perhaps Prime Minister Disraeli was quite correct when he said, \\"Our gold standard is not the cause, but the consequence of our commercial prosperity.\\" The wealth of a nation is perhaps better judged by its (non-gold) natural resources, and the productivity of its citizens in putting those fortuitous gifts to good use.the world's supply of the metal, but I didn't require Johann Sutter's sob story to appreciate the fact.

All are loosely connected through characters we meet in the first, 11-year old Bobby Garfield and his best pals Sully-John and Carol, and one from the group of slightly older boys who torment them, Willie Shearman. Each of the storylines otherwise stands alone, more or less. In 1960, Bobby, a fatherless boy living with an uncaring mother, becomes attached to the world-wise Ted, an old man renting the rooms upstairs who is being hunted by sinister \\"low men in yellow coats\\". In 1966, new character Pete is on the verge of flunking out of the university because of his preoccupation with an addictive card game. More important to the book's overall plot, he falls in love with a fellow student, Carol from Story One, and through her discovers the anti-Vietnam peace movement. In 1983, Willie Shearman, a Vietnam veteran, continues to pay a bizarre penance for past sins, chief of which, apparently, was the wrong he did Carol as a boy. In 1999, emotionally and physically scarred Vietnam vet Sully-John remembers his time \\"in the green\\". Also in 1999, Carol and Bobby stumble across each other after leading separate lives for almost 40 years. The threads between all five plots are Carol and a beat-up old baseball glove once belonging to Bobby.<br />This is not one of King's more lucid works. Indeed, the Willie Shearman episode of 1983 needed much more explaining. (My reaction to it was just short of \\"Huh?!\\") However, a mediocre book by King is a gem by other standards, so it's impossible not to recommend it on some level. The point the author is trying to make, I think, is that the memories from our formative years, however deformed by succeeding events - in this case the Vietnam conflict - stay with us as powerful emotional catalysts, and perhaps as crippling psychological scars, even unto our twilight years and old age.<br />The film version of HEARTS IN ATANTIS, based almost solely on the first chapter dealing with the events of 1960, was magical in its use of visual and aural images to evoke that period in the mid-twentieth century when those in childhood, and middle-class America as a whole, were on the verge of losing their innocence. Because both I and the fictional Bobby turned eleven in that year, I could relate. And, I think the book will stir up memories in anyone of my generation, whether he/she fought in Southeast Asia or demonstrated at home.<br />Not a great book, but worth a read. Definitely see the movie for a more intense burst of the book's flavor.us as powerful emotional catalysts, and perhaps as crippling psychological scars, even unto our twilight years and old age.<br />The film version of HEARTS IN ATANTIS, based almost solely on the first chapter dealing with the events of 1960, was magical in its use of visual and aural images to evoke that period in the mid-twentieth century when those in childhood, and middle-class America as a whole, were on the verge of losing their innocence.

This small volume, 169 pages in paperback, is also nicely illustrated with many apt b/w photographs by Jean Mohr.<br />If you've ever been enchanted by ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL by Dr. James Herriot, an English country veterinarian, then A FORTUNATE MAN starts out promising enough with a half dozen or so brief accounts of Dr. Sassall's interactions with his patients. Then, the remainder and greater portion of the text is a lengthy Berger essay based on his observations of the physician and his place in the community. Sassall himself, as might otherwise be revealed by his very real and illustrative day to day rounds, is reduced to the introductory cameos.<br />Berger mixes philosophy and social commentary as he explores such subjects as the doctor/patient relationship, the art of diagnosis, the physician's social standing in the community, and the physician's view of suffering. The flavor of Berger's dissertation can be sampled from this snippet regarding suffering:<br />\\"The objective co-ordinates of time and space, which are necessary to fix a presence, are relatively stable. But the subjective experience of time is liable to be so grossly distorted - above all by suffering -that it becomes, both to the sufferer and any person partially identifying himself with the sufferer, extremely difficult to correlate with time proper. Sassall not only has to make this correlation, he also has to correlate the patient's subjective experience of time with his own subjective experience.\\"<br />The book is less about Dr. Sassall then the author's discernment of the man, and the two are not necessarily the same. This volume would be well-received as part of any medical school curriculum - Theory of Bedside Manner or Medical Ethics 1A, perhaps. For myself, as one who is grudgingly granted 10 minutes of a doctor's distracted attention during the annual physical - the HMO's time is money, after all - I wanted to be presented with first hand evidence that real doctors (like my father the GP who made house calls!) still exist somewhere in the world.

In BOONE'S LICK, we have a family of sodbusters, the Cecils, traversing the plains between Missouri and Wyoming shortly after the Civil War. The family is led by the mother, Mary Margaret, whose intent is to find her husband, gone these past 14 months and presumably living at one of the Army's frontier forts, possibly with an Indian woman. Along for the ride are Mary's children (G.T., Shay, Neva, and Marcy), her brother-in-law Seth, her half-sister Rosie, and her aged Pa. Also attaching themselves to the group are an old French priest, Fr.Villy, and a native guide, Charlie Seven Days.<br />Whereas LONESOME DOVE was a truly epic tale, both as a book and as one of the best TV miniseries ever broadcast, BOONE'S LICK is less ambitious, but enjoyable nonetheless. The character of Seth was sufficiently similar to that of Gus McCrae in the LONESOME DOVE screenplay that I could easily imagine McRae's Robert Duvall playing the part if BOONE'S LICK is ever brought to the screen. (Picturing Duvall as Seth added considerably to my enjoyment.)<br />Author McMurtry's style is very similar in both stories. He doesn't downplay the hardships and dangers of cross-country travel at that time and place in American history. But he doesn't ignore rustic Western humor either. When, while traveling by riverboat, Seth remarks to Mary Margaret that one of the crew, Joel, is thinking about marrying Rosie, MM retorts, \\"I don't think he's aiming that high. But he's aiming.\\" Indeed, the verbal interplay between the crusty, independent Seth and the determined, strong-willed Mary Margaret is one of the storyline's major joys.<br />This is not a great book by any stretch, mainly because it's a novella masquerading as a full-length novel (with a full-length novel's price tag). However, the characters are well drawn, the dialog seemingly authentic for the period, and the action believable.

Three years previous, she got caught in a sting gone awry, during which her partner was killed and her face stomped to a pulp. Now, after extensive reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation, she's back on the job. While on assignment to America, she stumbles across the trail of the man, Frank Harling, who ordered her beating. It's becomes evident that Frank is now involved in an international blackmail and money laundering scheme masterminded by highly placed individuals in the West's intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Not knowing whom to trust, even within her own service, Flint goes underground to track Harling down.<br />There's actually a second protagonist in this plot, Harry Cohen, who's on an almost equal footing with Flint. Harry, a solicitor by profession, was once MI5's chief legal counsel, but was sacked after recommending against too many operations of dubious legality. Now, Grace's friends bring Cohen back to find Flint before she runs afoul of either Harling again or the criminal schemers within the Establishment that want her investigation stopped. But, are Grace's \\"friends\\" really her friends, or are they the Bad Guys?<br />Flint is fascinating because of the heavy load of emotional and psychological baggage she carries. There are, obviously, the aftereffects of her physical trauma manifested by her obsession with Harling. But also, as the storyline reveals, Grace's mother vanished one day when her daughter was but a young girl, apparently to foul play since the family dog was severely and deliberately injured in the same event. The woman was never found, not even her body. For a period during her adolescence, Grace actually thought that her veterinarian father had committed the murder, and had him investigated by the police - an investigation that discovered nothing. Because of all this, Flint is extremely vulnerable. Yet she remains smart, highly motivated, and terribly good at what she does for the London Metropolitan Police, i.e. being an undercover agent that can completely take on whatever role of the moment she needs to play. In that sense, she's a chameleon, both to her quarry and the reader.<br />As much as I enjoyed FLINT, I'm only awarding 4 stars because of a major loose end not tidied up at the conclusion - the question of her mother's disappearance. Perhaps the author means to return to the mystery in a sequel. Perhaps not. It seems too curious a thread to leave hanging, and I shall be sorely vexed if a following volume doesn't revisit the incident.y the police - an investigation that discovered nothing.

He had nothing but high praise for the army commander, Field-Marshal William Slim. This prompted me to purchase and read Slim's own account of the time and place, DEFEAT INTO VICTORY. The two books are a perfect pair for anyone interested in the India-Burma Theater of the war - perspectives from both the top and bottom of the British Army's command structure.<br />Slim's memoirs, first published in 1956 while he was serving as Governor General of Australia, begin with his assignment to command the 1st Burma Corps during it's desperate fighting retreat from Burma into India in 1942 after the Japanese captured Rangoon. Then later, as chief of the 14th Indian Army, he oversees the regrouping and rebuilding of the force that finally decimates the Japanese invaders at Imphal in northern India, and subsequently chases the fleeing enemy back south through Burma.<br />One of Slim's most notable characteristics is his evident lack of an overbearing ego. Several times in his book, he makes reference to his mistakes, errors in planning or judgement, and his deficiencies as a military commander. (Imagine that other famous British Field-Marshal of the war, the prima donna Montgomery, admitting such!) Much to his credit, Slim apparently learned hard lessons as he went along, and emerged as the better man and general for it. This, combined with his great concern for his men's morale, health, training and supply, justifies the high regard in which he was held by \\"rankers\\" such as Fraser. Churchill was wrong when he remarked, \\"I cannot believe that a man with a name like Slim can be much good.\\"<br />The author's history of the Burma war is comprehensive - perhaps excessively so for the casual reader such as myself. His narrative includes the movement of troops as far down as battalion level, which is way more than I needed to know. Because of this, I might have awarded 4 stars instead of 5 had I been less mindful of the contribution Slim's memoir makes to the history of an almost forgotten theater of the global conflict. A keener student of the Burma campaigns is certain to appreciate these details more than I did.<br />Finally, there is the Field-Marshal's dry British wit, which shows all too infrequently. For example, when discussing his opposite number in the Japanese Army, Lieutenant General Kawabe, Slim writes:<br />\\"I did, however, manage to get a photograph alleged to be that of Kawabe. It showed what might have been a typical western caricature of a Japanese; the bullet head, the thick glasses, and prominent teeth were all there... When I needed cheering I looked at it and assured myself that, whichever of us was the cleverer general, even I was, at any rate, the better looking.\\"elf.

Perhaps it's the weather.<br /><br />Chris, a sheep-shearer and sometime travel writer, begins his narrative as he's traveling alone in Spain's Andalusia. Right off, he spends his life's savings on a somewhat isolated, but definitely rustic, farm called El Valero without first calling England to consult with his wife, Ana. (Now, this strikes me as a markedly hazardous course, and brings to mind the prudent caution, \\"Don't try this at home\\".) In any case, he adroitly manages to sell the concept to a dubious spouse, and soon the Stewarts and the family dog cut all ties to Sussex and immigrate to their new rural residence.<br /><br />One major difference between author Stewart and author Mayle is that the former doesn't dwell hedonistically on the food and wine of his adopted country. (One brief reference to a local delicacy favored by Macho Locals, burnt chicken's heads, may indicate the grounds for such an omission.) Rather, DRIVING OVER LEMONS is all about rebuilding El Valero into something more civilized, installing running water via an ancient aqueduct, constructing a bridge over a river that flows through the property, acquiring and maintaining a herd of sheep, begetting a daughter, Chloe, and interacting with the natives and other members of the Foreign Community. However, one characteristic that Chris does share with Mayle (and Hawes) is a wonderfully dry and entertaining wit that seems to be a genetic trait of British expatriate writers. For example, when describing the belated christening ceremony of 3 year-old Chloe:<br /><br />\\"Chloe looked as if she was about to cut up rough but Ana managed to bribe her into a hesitant co-operation by flashing the edge of a bar of chocolate, kept at the ready in her pocket, and pointing meaningfully towards the altar. Chloe edged forward throwing side glances at the chocolate in the way that sailors keep a lighthouse in view when crossing onshore tides. (After the ceremony) Ana and I breathed a sigh of relief as she slunk back to (her best friend) Rosa clutching her chocolate. I like to think they shared it. It's no good going through the form of the thing, you have to act by its precepts.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed this volume immensely, and hope that Stewart, like Mayle, will make a literary series of it.

Sophia was ultimately killed on the order of the Emperor Constantine, who wished to keep his empire free of religious squabbles. Over the centuries, the Catholic Church, grounded in its belief of Jesus Christ as the one and only Messiah, suppressed knowledge of Sophia's existence for the same reason. Now, decades after the Nazis stumbled across the great secret and used it to blackmail Pius XII, the evidence is again up for grabs by Church zealots, the U.S. National Security Agency, and an unholy alliance comprised of the Russian Mafia and ex-KGB. (Our old Cold War nemesis never goes away in authors' fevered imaginations, it just diversifies.)<br />DAUGHTER OF GOD is a fast-paced, moderately intelligent, and semi-taut thriller that has the Ridgeways escaping one hairy situation after another as they're pursued from Southern California to the Austrian Alps by assassins. In that regard, the plot is eminently predictable. However, as both Zoe and Seth are basically nice folks caught in a bad spot, the reader is unlikely to withhold sympathy. The ending holds a couple of character identity surprises, but they weren't so unusual as to cause me to exclaim, \\"Wow, way cool!\\"<br />While I'm of the opinion that this book is marginally entertaining escapist entertainment, I also think, in the light of recent events in New York and Washington, that it's also rather silly. The Holy Mother Church and the Russian Mafia, the latter with or without assistance from KGB troglodytes, are the least of our worries. Maybe our literary fiction in this genre needs to grow up.with or without assistance from KGB troglodytes, are the least of our worries.

This will give you some idea of the flavor of CLEMENTINE IN THE KITCHEN, written by Samuel Chamberlain (under the nom de plume Phineas Beck), and first published in 1943.<br />The Chamberlains - Samuel, wife, son, and daughter - were residents in the French town of Senlis for several years immediately before the outbreak of World War II. Samuel was an American businessman representing a U.S. company. After enduring five successive unsatisfactory cooks, the family discovered Clementine, a miracle worker in the kitchen. Then, brought back to the States by his company in 1939 because of gathering war clouds, Samuel offers to take the unattached Clementine to the Chamberlains' new home in Marblehead, MA. In addition to being about French food and the preparation of it, CLEMENTINE IN THE KITCHEN is a charming narrative of the lady's introduction to things distinctly un-French, including such wonders as the American outdoor barbecue ceremony, supermarkets, hot dogs, whole hams (unknown back home except by the very rich), frozen foods, canned clam juice, breakfast cereals, Coon cheese, and blueberries.<br />A few eternal truths were apparent even 60+ years ago. Two examples:<br />&quot;Sliced American bread in cellophane puzzled Clementine. Those even white slices might be fine for sandwiches of ham and cheese sauteed in butter and covered with a cream sauce, but they didn't have enough substance for her idea of good table bread.&quot; Isn't this the truth?! (Such bread does make good peanut butter 'n' jelly sandwiches - though folded over, not cut.)<br />&quot;The wastefulness of American packaging shocked us all... Fully half the weight of our purchases seemed to go into the trash barrel. The economical Clementine began to save paper bags, until the pile became overwhelming.&quot; Don't I know it! Sounds like my wife.<br />The book's first 150 pages comprise Samuel's narrative regarding Clementine's initial admission into the household, and her subsequent expatriation to Massachusetts. This section contains a few recipes relevant to the text, and a number of B&amp;W sketches, perhaps pencil/charcoal originals, by the author himself. These sketches are truly marvelous works of art depicting locations described: the family's homes in Senlis and Marblehead, the Senlis main shopping street, a favorite French cafe, Boston's Faneuil Hall Market, shady Marblehead lanes, and many others. The book's final 100 pages is a compilation of Clementine's recipes revised by Samuel's daughter, Narcisse. (Clementine didn't stay with the Chamberlains, for a reason I won't reveal here.)<br />CLEMENTINE IN THE KITCHEN is a must-have addition for anyone interested in food, the time necessary for experimenting with French cooking, and the metabolism to absorb unscathed lots of butter and cream sauces. Unfortunately, I don't have the last two. So, let's see - what frozen dinner gets popped into the microwave tonight?ming.&quot; Don't I know it!

Granted, it's actually a compendium of three works previously published over a span of many years, but I salute Fraser's ability to sustain the level of humor from the beginning to end of his McAuslan saga.<br />Another of the author's remarkable talents is his ability to recreate in text a heavy Scottish dialect. After finishing, I gave the book to a colleague from Scotland, and she delightedly pronounced the dialogue authentic. I suspect that this collection of stories, based on Fraser's reminiscences of his own stint as a very junior officer with a Highland regiment for several years immediately after World War II, will entertain anyone who's ever served in the military, no matter what country or service branch. I myself spent 11 years in the U.S. Navy, and I couldn't put it down.<br />Absolutely first class!	2001-09-21

It makes severe air turbulence the event of choice for the truly discriminating road warrior.  Meridian #5, a 747 on a flight from Hong Kong to the States, has its pilot killed and the co-pilot completely blinded by a mysterious flash of light shortly after take-off. As theres no other qualified pilot aboard, uh-oh, whos going to land the aircraft? How about that smart-alecky 14 year old kid in coach? You think? And what is the relationship of this incident to the other airliner that nosedived into the Caribbean just two months earlier?<br />Enter FBI agent Katherine Bronsky. Kat can fly planes, both jets and prop jobs. (Too bad shes not on Meridian 5.) She can also pilot helicopters and drive a Sno-Cat. Best of all, she can disguise herself to look like a blond and expensive workin girl. (Now, thats my kind of woman!) In this potboilers second half, she mothers a group of Meridian 5s passengers as theyre pursued from the jungles of Vietnam to the snowfields of Idaho by murderous villains. (How did the plane land, you ask? Well, read the book.)<br />BLACKOUT is perfect escapist entertainment for a day at the beach or the ski lodge. The first half is infinitely better than the second because of the in-flight action. The latter suffers from being a more-or-less ordinary and extended chase sequence built around several mighty close shaves. There is indeed an element of mystery as the reader wonders which of the Good Guys back at FBI HQ is actually one of the Bad Guys trying to eliminate Kat and her charges before they spill the beans on the nefarious conspiracy that got Meridian 5 into Deep Bandini, and is about to send commercial air travel into the toilet. Unfortunately, the conclusion seems just too pat, and several threads are left hanging. Its like the author had to finish by a too soon publishing deadline. However, Ill still award 3.5 stars, rounded out to 4.n publishing deadline. However, Ill still award 3.5 stars, rounded out to 4.	2001-09-15

In FRENCH LESSONS, subtitled \\"adventures with knife, fork and corkscrew\\", we vicariously accompany the author on gastronomic fieldtrips to other French provinces near and far. Mayle sometimes falls prey to overindulgence in food and wine when accompanied by a like-minded, hedonistic, male pal, and not under the watchful gaze of the Missus. Yet, whether he's reveling at the festivities of local fairs celebrating the delights of truffles, frogs' legs, cheese, escargots, or an elite breed of chicken, he remains in the constant, unobtrusive good humor that one expects from an Englishman abroad. Peter remains smooth and unflappable, though not completely unappreciative of the local female talent, even when dining amidst the almost-naked lunch crowd at a beachside bistro near St. Tropez. And when the going gets tough, the tough get going, as he leisurely observes, glass in hand, a runners' marathon through the Bordeaux vineyards, and the high drama of a wine auction in Burgundy.<br />Probably one of the more enlightening chapters is towards the end of the book, as the author does a behind-the-scenes report on the inspectors employed by the Michelin Guide, and the evolution of its star rating system. (This last bit was most instructive, though it still doesn't explain why Guido's Big Apple Pizza Palace down at the corner has no Michelin stars at all.)<br />Peter Mayle is one of those chaps, a bon vivant to the core, with whom it would be a true privilege to share a bottle of wine, a baguette, some stinky cheese, and (even) garlic-drenched snails at an outdoor caf&eacute; in some remote French village. His books continue to provide considerable pleasure and entertainment, and I shall continue to buy them without hesitation.	2001-09-02

It's now 1984, and Munch is still an ace auto mechanic, but with a limo business on the side to help bring in money to support herself and her daughter Asia, the latter &quot;acquired&quot; during the last episode, NO OFFENSE INTENDED. In the first novel of the series, Munch had a refreshing antisocial edginess that colored her efforts to steer clear of a murder investigation being conducted by LAPD detective Mace St. John. By the following thriller, Munch had mellowed considerably, though still finding herself in compromising situations most law-abiding citizens never encounter. In UNWANTED COMPANY, Munch is almost a model citizen as she helps an older and wearier St. John catch a serial killer, with ripples involving the CIA, a shady Romanian, and some loose plutonium. Our heroine's continuing display of an improving social attitude remains a mild disappointment. However, in this thriller, the author compensates by introducing us to one of Mancini's old pals, Ellen, just out of the women's correctional institute and still feeling ambivalent about giving up illegal substances and turning tricks. In any case, Munch gives her a job as a limo driver, upon which Ellen wastes no time dragging her employer and the Caddy into St. John's latest case. Ellen is strangely endearing as she ricochets from one risky situation to another with more concern for her appearance, wigs and make-up kit than anything else. I hope Seranella invites her back in future offerings. Perhaps the quality of the series has reached a steady state of almost-excellence as the novelty of the Munch persona wears off somewhat subsequent to her first appearance on LA's low-life street scene. Be that as it may, Mancini remains an intriguing, attractive, vulnerable and slightly prickly protagonist that I shall continue to follow with devotion.le and slightly prickly protagonist that I shall continue to follow with devotion.	2001-08-24

When Navy pilot Mick Craik's fighter jet is terminally damaged by an Iranian SAM, his son, Navy Intelligence Analyst Lt. (jg) Alan Craik, watches in horror from a refueling plane as his father's aircraft crashes into the Persian Gulf. While brooding about the circumstances of the incident, Alan comes to the conclusion that Dad was deliberately set up to take the fall by an unidentified traitor serving aboard a US aircraft carrier. But who's going to listen to a very junior IA?<br />RULES OF ENGAGEMENT spans several years as the younger Craik and his crackpot theory gain credibility within the Naval Intelligence community as pieces of confirmatory evidence fall into place. Finally, evolving events and opportunity combine to send Alan chasing across continents to capture his father's killer.<br />The jacket of this paperback lauds the novel as a &quot;can't put down book&quot;. Although a solidly crafted yarn, it's not quite that until the last third or so when the plot picks up enough speed to justify the description. Until then, the pace is comparatively sedate as Craik matures both professionally and personally. And it isn't until then that this reader got very interested in the young officer's crusade. One major plus is the marriage of Alan to a fellow naval officer, helo pilot Rose Siciliano. It's a nice touch that Rose outranks her husband, and, furthermore, is overtly more ambitious than he to climb the command ladder. (You go, girl!) However, when the two cross operational paths at the very end, it seems too convenient a plot gimmick.<br />The successor to the USSR's KGB, the SVRR, plays a support role in an odd alliance with the CIA. The two spy organizations are represented by mid-level, female executives, Darya Ouspenskaya and Sally Baranowski respectively. The collaboration between the two was given too little print space, an expansion of which would have made the storyline significantly more interesting.<br />This is the debut potboiler by Gordon Kent, actually a pseudonym of a father-son writing team.

Curiously, his first political hero was Senator/Presidential Candidate Goldwater. Why? Because Barry told it like it was. But LBJ won and Viet Nam escalated, followed by Nixon and Watergate. The lies were endless, and Joe was disgusted. Then, in 1992, along came William Jefferson Clinton, America's first President of the rock `n' roll generation. Eszterhas was ecstatic. Bill won't lie because \\"he's one of us\\".<br />AMERICAN RHAPSODY is a powerful, bawdy, brilliant, full-frontal excoriation of Bill Clinton's almost-personal betrayal of the author's hopes and expectations. Because Bubba lied to America - about sex, his preoccupation with it, and his tawdry affair with the First Bimbo, Monica Lewinsky. Joe claims the bulk of the narrative is based on well-researched facts, though there's no bibliography of primary source material - a key omission, perhaps. Several of the chapters, presented in bold type, are admittedly fictitious monologues ascribed to several key players in this red, white and blue soap opera.<br />As Eszterhas explores Bubba's promiscuity specifically, and that of Washington and Hollywood in general, the lead roles are reserved for Bill, \\"Willard\\", and Monica. The supporting cast is otherwise extensive: Hillary, Bob Dole, John McCain, James Carville, Arianna Huffington (the \\"Sorceress\\"), Matt Drudge, Linda Tripp (the \\"Ratwoman\\"), Ken Starr, Bob Packwood, Sharon Stone, Warren Beatty, Larry Flynt, and Vernon Jordan, plus cameos by Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick, and a bevy of others. The author ascribes particular significance to the lasting and pernicious influence of his personal bogeyman-under-the-bed, Richard Nixon (the \\"Night Creature). Why this is apparently so really isn't clear. (Get over it, Joe! Nixon is dead for Chrissakes!) And the reasons for including the Huffingtons, Dole, and McCain on the playbill are particularly hazy, although Eszterhas clearly admires the take-no-prisoners honesty of both McCain and Carville. Prominent utilization is also made of the two infamous props of the piece: The Cigar and the Stained Blue Dress.<br />Though it could've benefited from tighter editing, AMERICAN RHAPSODY is a ribald, spirited, cheeky and fun read. It may stand as one of the definitive books on the Clinton Presidency.

Technically, the colonial government, headed by Eske Brun, should have followed the instructions from Copenhagen, i.e. the Nazi occupiers. But, Brun decided to take Greenland into the camp of the Allies. Thus, he formed the Greenland Army, to which he gave instructions to patrol the virtually uninhabited northeast coast of the huge island, and be on the lookout for (and shoot at) any German forces attempting to land. This instance of a &quot;mouse that roared&quot; serves as the milieu for this story, first published in 1957.<br />In fact, the Germans did &quot;invade&quot;. A small, armed force under a naval officer named Ritter made landfall for the purpose of establishing a meteorological station tasked with broadcasting weather reports to the Kriegsmarines U-boats operating in the North Atlantic. This &quot;base&quot;, out beyond the last human settlement, subsequently came to the notice of THE SLEDGE PATROL, commanded by Ib Poulsen, which represented the entire 9-man Greenland Army. (Yes, that's right. Nine!)<br />The action of the book is principally a series of almost haphazard dog sled journeys across snow and ice-covered bodies of water and land by members of the Greenland Army and the German intruders. At times, as both sides seek each other out, one is reminded of a Keystone Cops episode. Though the climate provides some element of hardship, the damage done by each opposing force to the other is minimal. Indeed, if one views the Germans as the Bad Guys, their nominal leader, Ritter, is hardly the great villain of the piece. As a matter of fact, hes such a nice and ultimately decent guy that hes clearly inept in the role of military commander. Poulsen, as the leader of the Good Guys, is conscientious and responsible in carrying out his duties, but otherwise rather nondescript.<br />This narrative serves to record the personal heroism and stamina of those men - chiefly Poulsen, Kurt Olsen and Marius Jensen - ordered by the Governor to observe and report back the German presence. And resist, if possible. Of that heroism and stamina the reader is left with no doubts. However, the time at which the events occurred, late winter/early spring of 1943, was also the period seeing an end to the Battle of Stalingrad and the final conquest of North Africa by the Anglo-American armies. Against the backdrop of these pivotal conflicts, the exploits of THE SLEDGE PATROL pale to absolute insignificance. Perhaps thats why their story should be told. Or, perhaps, why bother? You must decide for yourself.

Indeed, the first couple of chapters reprise events of her life with Rosie and her uncles - all in the context of explaining her developing love for \\"the country\\". This is not unexpected in someone who grew up in small, overcrowded, city apartments. Most of the book revolves around the two rural homes in which the author has spent a good portion of her adult life, the Castle and The Inn, the latter having been her abode away from The City for the last 18 years up to the present.<br />Laura's life has been, in many ways, perfectly ordinary - probably not so different from the general pattern of yours or mine. Perhaps that's why it's so appealing. (We have here not the memoir of an obnoxious diva, whining and overpaid sports figure, or dysfunctional actor.) The author's great ability in sharing is her gentle, wry sense of humor, whether it's telling us about the trials of converting an old underground cistern into a swimming pool, or starting an ill-conceived cottage industry in potpourri pillows, or battling the local fauna over home-grown tomatoes, or the adoption of her first daughter from Romania, or her second daughter from China, or learning the pitfalls inherent to raising chickens, geese and goats.

THE END OF WAR, using as a backdrop the last few months of the war against Hitler's Third Reich, is equally riveting and compelling.<br />The legions of the Western Allies are advancing to the Rhine, and the Red Army juggernaught is poised to invade Poland from across that country's eastern border. The logical goal of both: Berlin.<br />The characters in the second echelon of this fictional work are 20th century giants of political and military history: Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, and generals Eisenhower and Zhukov. It is their ideology, pride, suspicion, and desire for glory that determines the paths of armies. It's history that Berlin was taken by Zhukov and the Soviets. Because Robbins apparently did extensive research from a long bibliography to recreate the high-level decisions that directed that outcome, I like to think that much of what I read was factual. But, never mind. The value of THE END OF WAR lies in its fictional characters, the first echelon, who live under the greasy arrows drawn on the warlords' battle maps.<br />Ilya is a former Soviet Army major, a hero of Stalingrad, reduced to enlisted status in a penal battalion because an uncle, a general, angered Stalin. Lottie is a young cello player of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, cowering with her mother under the daily (and nightly) rain of British and American bombs. Charley Bandy, whose aspiration is to enter Germany's capital with the first Anglo-American force to get there, is an American photographer working for LIFE magazine.<br />This novel is one that virtually demands to be read at one sitting. All characters are expertly brought to life, and the dialog is consistently arresting and believable. Above all else, the images Robbins brings to mind are powerful and unforgettable. It's almost as if you're there smelling Winston's cigar, or the brick dust of Berlin's rubble.

The Red soldiers vent themselves on the Germans ... They have debts to collect ... One of the Germans mutters in Russian, `Bastards' ... All of these men hate. Back and forth, volleys of loathing ... Two of the Germans reach to the ground to lift their comrade. They put the man on his feet and release him with care. He stays erect, shaking. The rest of the prisoners move by instinct closer, penned animals do the same ... One of the Russians raises his rifle to his cheek, ridiculous, as though he needs to aim this close to his targets ... Ilya's mouth is bone dry. He could speak ... He could say, what? ...Another crow dispatches his voice from the trees ...

I & CLAUDIUS is their on-the-road story as they start out in Connecticut, then head south through New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana, then west through Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and southern Nevada to the Pacific at Los Angeles, then finally north to the San Francisco Bay area. As Clare describes it early on, her route is a smiley face on a map of America.<br />Clare can be endearingly ditzy. At one point, she all but admits not knowing that cars need regular infusions of motor oil to run. She drives west ignorant of the difference between Las Vegas, NV and Las Vegas, NM until she arrives at the latter and can&#8217;t find the bright lights and casinos. She carries on imaginary conversations with Claudius, the back-and-forth repartee of which is recorded in the book as if she was talking to another human. She can also be infuriating. An understated need of her journey is to find Love, or at least Lust. Yet her taste in men is so abysmal that she consistently attaches herself to Complete Losers. .... She blames it on a fear of commitment. Only Claude has her heart.<br />Claudius, on the other hand, is the coolest feline on the planet. Perhaps it&#8217;s mellowness due to his advanced age (133 in human, biological clock years). I can&#8217;t even imagine my own cat, Trouble, sitting quietly on my lap for the entire duration of a western rodeo. Or on my lap in a 4-seater, light plane flying over the Grand Canyon abyss. Claudius manages every experience with aplomb, though his serene composure did crack a bit when faced with a bear noshing from his food dish.<br />I & CLAUDIUS is a touching and amusing travel essay, though the smiley face on Clare&#8217;s map is a bit forced at times due to her angst over what she expects to be her pet&#8217;s sooner-than-later demise. (He is, after all, 19 cat-years old.) Occasional crises, real or imagined, in Claude&#8217;s health are interspersed with droll car, motel (&#8220;No Pets Allowed&#8221;) and man problems. Indeed, it&#8217;s a minor miracle that Clare found time to enjoy any of America&#8217;s attractions. (Claudius apparently did. While on the road, he became addicted to KFC &#8211; regular, not spicy.) One of the funniest incidents is that of the Tarantula-Under-the-Car-Seat. (I was tempted to peer under the seat of my own sedan after that anecdote!) And the montage of color photos on the inside of both the front and back covers of the paperback edition is a very nice touch.<br />I unreservedly recommend this book to any cat owner whose pet is also a true pal. ....oner-than-later demise.

Rex Ever Found	Books	3	13	16	N	N	Only in America	In the summer of 1990, a team of fossil hunters representing the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, led by Peter Larson, unearthed the nearly complete skeleton of a mighty darn large Tyrannosaurus rex dinosaur buried on South Dakota land owned by one Maurice Williams. Larson paid Williams $5,000 for the skeleton, named it \\"Sue\\", and then moved it to the Institute's facility at Hill City for preservation and restoration. In May 1992, the Bandini hit the fan with an FBI raid and confiscation, and TYRANNOSAURUS SUE is the story of the 7-year legal mess that resulted. A mess that could only happen in America, the Land of the Free and the Home of Eternal Litigation.<br /> Steve Fiffer, a Windy City journalist, has ably reconstructed Sue's saga, from the time her bones were spotted by Sue Hendrickson in a sandstone cliff, to their auction years later to an unlikely consortium comprised of the Field Museum of Natural History, Disney Corporation, and McDonald's. Most of the narrative details the protracted and acerbic civil and criminal litigation that surrounded custody of the fragmented skeleton, the chief contestants being Larson, Williams, the Cheyenne River Sioux, and the U.S. Justice Department. If the reader is a paleontologist, or just otherwise fascinated by big, toothy lizards, then this book is a must read. However, my interest was only mildly inquisitive, so I found parts of it dry going. First of all, there are no photos - not a single one. I find this hard to fathom, since Sue's excavation site was extensively photographed, the various court sessions heavily (if only locally) covered, and the reconstructed skeleton was put on permanent display before the book was published. I mean, c'mon Steve! Secondly, that part of the account describing historical aspects of dinosaur hunting in the U.S. was pretty much irrelevant to the central story, and Chapter 10, which contained too much of the criminal trial's verbatim testimony, was cause for Droopy Eyelids Syndrome. Lastly, I couldn't muster much sympathy for any one or more of the principal courtroom adversaries. Peter Larson, indicted with others from the Institute by the Feds for illegally removing artifacts from government land, was, at best, a naïve fossil-hunting nerd, or, at worst, a cunning and disingenuous outlaw. The government's chief prosecutor, Kevin Schieffer, came across as unreasonable and intransigent. Maurice Williams, who denied he was selling Sue when given that $5K, was the quintessence of greed. And how about those the Cheyenne River Sioux? A bunch of opportunists! Patrick Duffy, Larson's lawyer, conducted himself like a certifiable idiot. The only likable person in the entire tale seemed to be Sue Hendrickson, but, with no picture, it's hard to say for sure.<br />The value of TYRANNOSAURUS SUE was, to me, learning something about the world around me that I didn't know before.

Books	3	5	6	N	Y	A mildly droll tale of aging Baby Boomer angst and hypochond	Meet Martin Dorfman, a just-turned-40 wannabe Hollywood screenwriter who, after a decade of struggling, has yet to have any of his scripts picked up by a Tinseltown studio. Now, if life in Paradise wasn't imperfect enough, he begins suffering from bouts of nausea, dizziness, abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite, and a general malaise. What does the local medical establishment diagnose after blood tests, CAT scan, MRI, colonoscopy, and stool exam for parasites? Absolutely nothing. (And what part of \\"zilch\\" doesn't he understand?) Well then, WHAT'S WRONG WITH DORFMAN?<br />As Marty's condition becomes long-term chronic, he resorts to the usual medley of Southern California remedies: exotic herbal treatments, special diets, and psychotherapy. (I mean, how LA!) His only comfort comes from a friendship with a fellow sufferer and wannabe actress whom he meets in his doctor's office. His attraction to Delilah is based on symbiotic self-pity and a quirky fascination:<br />\\"(Delilah) is now fiddling with her brown recycled napkin, tearing it into shreds and carefully arranging the shreds in a line around her fork. Bored with this, she begins turning the shreds into little spitballs. Curiously, I find this neurotic display attractive.\\"<br />Author John Blumenthal takes the reader back and forth between Dorfman's miserable present, and his miserable childhood past in a household headed by his father, Felix, and mother, Gloria. The former is a dysfunctional physician, who over-diagnoses his own family's minor afflictions, and the latter is simply long-suffering. Then there are the other important characters in the plot: Martin's sister Phoebe, wife Ursula, daughter Amanda, agent Gavin, and shrink Nora.<br />WHAT'S WRONG WITH DORFMAN? starts out acceptably amusing, and continues in that vein for about two-thirds of the book. I grant it that. Then, the humor seeps away, like blood from an open cut, to an anemic conclusion. None of Dorfman's relationships, except perhaps that with his father, are developed beyond the superficial. For example, the reader barely becomes acquainted with the three women in Martin's life that would seemingly have importance: Gloria, Phoebe, and Ursula. I finished the novel with a marked feeling of disappointment. I wanted to know more about the storyline's critical path, and less about the tangential subplots. For instance, why did Gloria absent herself from the family for six months when Martin and Phoebe were just children? In any case, by the time I finished the last page, I couldn't muster even a chuckle, and my overall response was \\"OK, so?\\" Perhaps, the author would have done better not to write this as a humorous piece, but beef it up and present it as serious fiction about the psychological harm sometimes inflicted by parents on their offspring.th his father, are developed beyond the superficial.

He&#8217;s taken me places near and distant, portraying his subjects with an endearing blend of affection, bemused fascination, and Farm Belt admiration. (He&#8217;s from Iowa.) And, when telling of those places, persons, events, or situations that are unfathomable, or just a little bit odd, he does so with dry wit and a straight face. (His style can be enjoyed on the video version of his book on Great Britain, NOTES FROM A SMALL ISLAND, available from..., in which he serves as the on-screen narrator.)<br />IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY, Bill takes us Down Under, to Australia, for his latest love affair with another country. Perhaps it&#8217;s because he lived for so many years in England that he feels such an affinity for this former British colony that is largely ignored by the rest of the world. Whether he&#8217;s thrashing about in the ocean over the Great Barrier Reef, driving across an eternity of barrenness just to see Ayers Rock, wandering through the mind-numbing blandness of Canberra, describing the region&#8217;s deadly fauna, or commenting on the uniqueness of a shop specializing in pet supplies and porn, he does so with a good humor that makes you wish you were there too. (Well, most of the time, anyway.) Concerning the radio&#8217;s play-by-play presentation of a cricket match, endured on a long drive through the outback, Bryson records with evident relish:<br />&#8220;Neasden, it appeared, was turning in a solid performance at square bowel, while Packet had been a stalwart in the dribbles, though even these exemplary performances paled when set aside the outstanding play of young Hugo Twain-Buttocks at middle nipple. The commentators were in calm agreement that they had not seen anyone caught behind with such panache since Tandoori took Rogan Josh for a stiffy at Vindaloo in &#8217;61. At last Stovepipe, having found his way over the railway line at Flinders Street &#8211; the footbridge was evidently closed for painting &#8211; returned to the stadium and bowled to Hasty, who deftly turned the ball away for a corner&#8230;. I may not have the terminology exactly right, but I believe I have caught the flavor of it.&#8221;<br />Only once does Bryson become uncharacteristically testy. On checkout from the Darwin City Frontier Hotel, when he was invited to visit again by the desk attendant, his retort, &#8220;I would sooner have bowel surgery in the woods with a stick&#8221;, is indication of a truly bad experience.<br />Commendably, the author provides the reader with many facts, figures and anecdotes behind Australia&#8217;s history and evolution as a nation (although even he can&#8217;t say for sure if the actual number of original convict-settlers was 529, 696, 751 or 775). Thus, it comes as a surprise and disappointment that he relatively ignores the Aboriginals. These unfortunate people ostensibly present such an awkward problem for the population&#8217;s majority that Bryson comes to adopt the same stance as the locals, and simply ignores the natives after a few cursory observations. To his credit, however, he admits it, and doesn&#8217;t seem too proud of the fact. But, in a beginning at redemption, he also makes absolutely no mention of Paul Hogan or any reference to &#8220;puttin&#8217; a shrimp on the Bah-B for ya&#8221;.y closed for painting &#8211; returned to the stadium and bowled to Hasty, who deftly turned the ball away for a corner&#8230;.

Content as I usually am with relatively trashy popular fiction, I don't know that I can write a review that'll do this volume the honor it merits.<br />This is the life story of Pelagia, a Greek woman living on the (actual) island of Cephallonia off Greece's western coast. The narrative begins at her age of 17, and continues for about fifty-three years. Eighty percent of the storyline takes place immediately before and during the Italian-German occupation of the island during the Second World War. The plot is a tapestry of human existence, woven with its diverse threads: absurdity, tragedy, love, betrayal, loyalty, madness, cruelty, fear, courage, resilience, selflessness, loss, revenge, hatred, and comedy. And because the Grecian theater of the wider conflict is so central to the story, the author doesn't abstain from including its history, foolishness, heroics, and horrific brutalities.<br />CORELLI'S MANDOLIN is filled with a wealth of memorable characters, all created with transcendent skill by the author, Louis de Berni&egrave;res. Besides Pelagia, there's her wise father, Iannis, a self-taught physician and an amateur historian. There are the other Greek villagers of note: the indomitable Drosoula, the mischievous Lemoni, the priest Arsenios, and the giant (in strength and spirit) Velisarios. And, then there's Pelagia's \\"funny kind of cat\\", the engaging Psipsina, a pet pine marten. Above all are the two young men who love Pelagia - Mandras, a neighbor ultimately debased and coarsened by the war, and Corelli of the occupying Italian Army, who is ennobled. Captain Antonio Correlli of the Acqui Division, and his mandolin.<br />The essence of the tale is Pelagia's determined survival in the face of every cruel misfortune, grievous loss, and emotional hit delivered upon her over the years. For example, the death of her father:<br />\\"I remember when Velisarios set (my father's body) down and I knelt beside him, blind and drunk with tears, and I cradled his bloodied head in my hands and saw that his eyes were empty. His old eyes, looking not on me but on the hidden world beyond. And I thought then for the first time how small and frail he was, how beaten and betrayed, and I realized that without his soul he was so light and thin that even I could lift him. And I raised up his body and clasped his head in my breast, and a great cry came out that must have been mine, and I saw clearly as one sees a mountain that he was the only man I've loved who loved me to the end, and never bruised my heart, and never for a single moment failed me.\\"<br />De Berni&egrave;res has crafted this epic with insight, inventiveness, compassion, an eye for detail, gentle humor, moral outrage, and intelligence. The reader's heart goes out to Kyria Pelagia, and, at the book's conclusion, is uplifted as Fortune, or a merciful God, extends to the old woman a well-earned and overdue benevolence.<br />You will likely not read a better work of fiction in your lifetime.body) down and I knelt beside him, blind and drunk with tears, and I cradled his bloodied head in my hands and saw that his eyes were empty.

Now, as ignorant novices in Chem 1A, we were at last to be initiated into its arcane symbolism.<br />MENDELEYEV'S DREAM is the story of chemistry, from the ancient Greek, Anaximenes, with his theory of air as the fundamental element compressible to water and stone, to the gnomic Russian genius, Mendeleyev, who conceived the Periodic Table in the mid-19th century. Conceived it in a dream during an exhausted sleep brought on by overwork and frustrated creativity. Sleeping, when he should have been on his way to address a meeting of local cheese-makers.<br />The author, Paul Strathern, has written a fine narrative overview of the evolution of the scientific method and the chemist's art, from the philosophical musings of the ancients on the nature of the universe, through the long centuries when alchemy held sway, to chemistry's current place in the Pantheon of Sciences. Along the way, Strathern introduces us to the greatest scientific minds and gifted eccentrics of their respective ages: Empedocles, Aristotle, Zosimus, Jabir ibn-Hayyan, Avicenna, Paracelsus, Nicholas of Cusa, Galileo, Descartes, Francis Bacon, van Helmont, Robert Boyle, Hennig Brand, Karl Scheele, Johann Becher, Henry Cavendish, Joseph Priestley, Antoine Lavoisier, John Dalton, J&ouml;ns Berzelius, and a host of others. And, finally, Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleyev.<br />The nature of the book's subject could easily lend itself to tedium, but the author's style is light - only once does he \\"balance\\" a chemical formula, and his intermittent dry wit was much appreciated. What, for instance, was Hennig Brand doing with those fifty buckets of putrefying human urine? His neighbors were undoubtedly not thrilled. And why might the Dutch Assembly have been justified in tacking-up \\"wanted-posters\\" around town for Johann Becher, who had just absconded on a fast boat for London?<br />A scientist himself, Paul has not penned a great technical piece. Rather, he's written an uncomplicated, engaging work of popular science likely to appeal to those of us who ... well, let's just say, didn't learn to transmute lead into gold, much less ace Chem 1A.

Fraser's narrative history of his personal contribution to this campaign is QUARTERED SAFE OUT HERE.<br />Written decades after the fact, this book does not pretend to be a comprehensive history of the Burma Theater in the last months of World War II. Rather, it's the war from the perspective of Nine Section in which Fraser fought, first as a Private, then Lance Corporal. (A \\"section\\" is the smallest operating unit of an infantry platoon, i.e. 8-10 men.) Besides being a vivid retelling of the author's recollections to the extent that he remembers, it's also an intimate portrait of the organization, weapons, tactics and camaraderie of the British Army at section level at that time, place, and conflict.  It's a story told with the humor, intelligence and introspection that comes with maturity and hindsight. And, though some of Fraser's bitterness towards his old foe occasionally shows, age does dull the sharp edges.<br />\\"I remember watching, a year or two ago, televised interviews with old Japanese soldiers who had fought in the war ... sitting in their gardens in their sports shirts, blinking cheerfully in the sunlight, reminiscing in throat-clearing croaks about battles long ago. It crossed my mind: were any of you on the Pyawbwe slope, and lived to tell the tale? Well, if they did, at this time of day I don't mind.\\"<br />Fraser is a truly gifted writer.  After VJ Day, he applied for, and was awarded, a commission as a subaltern (2nd Lieutenant) in a Scottish Highland division posted to the Middle East. In this capacity, his experiences served as the basis for his quite wonderful and comedic McAuslan series of fictional stories (collected and available from Amazon.co.uk in THE COMPLETE MCAUSLAN).

(\\"Are you reading again?! Which do you love more - me or that book?\\") Uh, sorry ... what did you say, dear?<br />This thriller by P.T. Deutermann is really two storylines in one, coming together only at the end. Each has its own protagonist and its own nutcase Bad Guy.<br />The primary plot has the TRAIN MAN blowing up railroad river bridges in retaliation for a past personal tragedy. The Good Guy on his trail is FBI Acting Assistant Director William \\"Hush\\" Hanson, who departs the Machiavellian atmosphere of the FBI's Washington headquarters for the field to run his quarry to ground. However, even out in the sticks, Hush isn't safe from the backstabbing and internecine warfare back at the Big House as spans continue to drop into the water. And what sort of game is Senior Agent Carolyn Lang, Hanson's assigned deputy for the manhunt, playing? Is that a treacherous blade in her belt, or just a friendly nail file?<br />The other wacko is US Army Colonel Mehle, down from the Pentagon and the National Security Council with explicit, no-nonsense orders to transport some captured Russian torpedoes with nuclear warheads from the Anniston Army Weapons Depot in Alabama to the Army's destruction facility in Tooele, Utah. The warheads need to go Right Now On The Double because they're leaking radiation, and the mode of transport is to be an Army train also taking chemical weapons to Utah for disposal. Top Brass pressure has made Mehle a bullet or two short of a full clip, so when the colonel decides to go along for the ride as the train's Full Throttle commander, Major Tom Matthews, the train's reluctant Security Officer, fears a bumpy ride and an inglorious end to his previously unblemished 20-year career.<br />Oh, and have I mentioned that the Train Man's targets are the bridges over the lower Mississippi River, that part of the waterway smack in the path between Alabama and Utah? Can you see where this is going?<br />Both plots are taut, suspenseful and finely paced, and the characters well drawn and believable. The identity of the TRAIN MAN comes as a surprise, though perhaps the revelation occurs too soon. Moreover, the author apparently researched America's rail system extensively, so the technical backdrop against which the action unfolds is very absorbing, especially if the reader has no prior knowledge of the subject. The novel's jacket compares it favorably to THE DAY OF THE JACKAL. I agree. This is quality reading entertainment.Utah?

This very informative volume by Andrew Smith describes every aspect of this snack food, from its evolution on the cob in pre-historical Central and South America to 20th century \\"gourmet popcorn\\" in microwave bags.<br />While the book's title states this is a \\"social history\\", it seemed to me more a chronicle of the popcorn industry, especially in the United States, where popcorn was \\"invented\\", i.e. reached the citizenry's mass consciousness, in the first half of the 19th century. Smith has extensively researched every element of the saga: growers, processors, vendors, entrepreneurs, popping devices, packaging, flavoring, advertising, and target markets (both children and adults, at home and at the \\"movies\\").<br />Because so much of this book is a detailed narrative of the biz, it's not particularly fun, but rather like popcorn without butter and salt. There are too many passages like the following:<br />\\"... Wyandot (Popcorn Company) was sold to Vogel Popcorn, a division of Golden Valley. Golden Valley is now owned by ConAgra. ConAgra had previously purchased Orville Redenbacher's Gourmet Popping Corn during the mid 1970s. Jiffy Pop was sold in 1962 to American Home Products. In 1996 American Home Products was acquired by Hick, Muse, Tate and Furst, an investment firm, and it food industry management affiliate, C. Dean Metropoulos. Today Jiffy Pop and Franklin Crunch `N' Munch are part of International Home Foods, Inc., of Parsippany , New Jersey.\\"<br />Why would any but the most obsessive of popcorn lovers, or business students, care?<br />POPPED CULTURE includes a small section of illustrations, and extensive sections dedicated to Notes and Bibliography/Resources. It also incorporates a 48-page chapter on historical recipes. Anyone for macaroni and popcorn, prune and popcorn pudding, popcorn omelet, popcorn macaroons, popcorn stuffed dates, popcorn soup, popcorn scrapple, popcorn and parsnips, popcorn and bacon, popcorn hash, popcorn with ice cream, or popcorn trifle?

Especially if you're Manech, a 20-year old French soldier convicted by a military court, along with four others, of committing self-mutilation with the intent of escaping service in the front lines of World War I. The punishment is grotesque. Rather than death by a firing squad, the five are to be thrust, hands bound, over the wire fronting the most forward trench and into the No Man's Land between the French and German positions - there to die by whatever bullet, mortar shell, or bomb strikes them down. The subsequent deaths of all five are attested to. Letters are sent to surviving family members by the French authorities saying their boys \\"died in battle\\". This was in 1917.<br />Mathilde was Manech's fianc&eacute;e when he marched off to battle. She's also confined to a wheelchair, unable to walk since she fell off a stepladder at age 3. In 1919, she's contacted by a dying survivor of the war, ex-Sergeant Esperanza, who'd been in charge of the provost detail assigned to escort the five condemned men to the front trench, as well as act as censor for the last letter each was permitted to write home. He tells Mathilde of their bizarre fate, and gives her copies of their last letters, transcribed by him personally. Using these copies and the veteran's story to provide clues, Mathilde embarks on a multi-year search for the truth behind Manech's death. Interviewing friends, family members, and lovers of Marech's four condemned companions, as well as other soldiers present in the trench, Mathilde needs to answer the question, \\"Is he truly dead?\\" She has doubts. The evidence is inconsistent.<br /> A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT is an odyssey of mystery, official cover-ups, lies, misperceptions, secrets, coincidence, tenuous clues, guilt, innocence, and honor. And, ultimately, love. Astute and sardonic Mathilde, perhaps because of her affliction, is a take-no-prisoners dynamo of perseverance. No obstacle is too great that it can't be overcome. In the end, she finds ... Truth.<br />This novel by S&eacute;bastien Japrisot is an unusual and unusually intelligent detective story, as well as a look at an almost-forgotten time and place strewn with the wreckage - physical, emotional and psychological - of the War to End All Wars.

Or is it simply evolution leaving the path of gradualism as defined by Darwin, and taking a more scenic route?<br />All good stories have a villain. In this case, it's SHEVA, a suddenly activated human endogenous retrovirus, i.e. one that resides in the \\"normal\\" genetic code on our chromosomes, that now forms infectious virus particles capable of lateral transmission between sexually active adults. What result are severe perturbations of the pregnancies of infected woman, and a bizarre skin condition that affects the faces of both parents. The world's best scientific minds can't stop it.  And what is the connection between the mummified remains of a 40,000-year old Neanderthal family found in the Alps, and the corpses exhumed from a 10-year old mass grave in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, all of which contain SHEVA?<br />Despite being (just) a work of popular science fiction, DARWIN'S RADIO poses an interesting, alternative hypothesis to the widely accepted concept of Darwinian evolution, i.e. natural adaptation one genetic mutation at a time, and makes some perceptive inferences on the nature of the species self-identity built into the human psyche. Moreover, the main characters are reasonably well constructed, particularly Kaye Lang, the swim-against-the-tide geneticist, and Mitch Rafelson, the outcast anthropologist. However, the novel is, at 525 paperbacked pages, just a tad too long. As it was, the conclusion's \\"pay-off\\" didn't seem quite worth the time that I'd spent to get there. I wanted to be able to say \\"Wow!\\", but couldn't. However, a 4-star rating still isn't too shabby.<br />By the way. Do you have pronounced freckles on your face? If so, the Feds may be wanting to deport you to Iowa even now. Pack a lunch.	2001-05-25

He strikes me as a curmudgeon-in-training, who, after further aging, will qualify for the closing act on a very popular and long running TV newsmagazine broadcast on Sunday evenings.<br />ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY is a series of 28 essays spanning the author's childhood to the present. The book's title is also that of one of the chapters, in which he relates the experience of learning French in Paris under the tutelage of a xenophobic Frenchwoman whose style relies heavily on the liberal application of humiliation and abuse. Most of the essays succeeded at making me laugh - certainly not in guffaws, but at least amused snorts. A few didn't. The subjects of some of the more successful included: being mistaken for a local pickpocket on the Paris M&eacute;tro by two American tourists, describing American idiosyncrasies as perceived by foreigners, doing New York Times crossword puzzles, describing the concept of Easter to a Muslim, and showing two friends from North Carolina around New York City. For me, the funniest selection was \\"Big Boy\\", which, unfortunately, was pure bathroom humor that can't be described here. (Hey, I never claimed to have elevated tastes!)<br />David's brand of raillery won't appeal to everyone. While always perceptive, it often is, like Mark Twain's, tongue-in-cheek. The following three examples will serve to illustrate. They concern, respectively: American nouveau cuisine, speaking \\"French\\" in France, and politically correct water conservation.<br />\\"The patty melt has been pushed aside in favor of the herb-encrusted medallions of baby artichoke hearts, which never leave me thinking, Oh, right, those! I wonder if they're as good as the ones my mom used to make.\\"<br />\\"The second, less complicated form of French amounts to screaming English at the top of your lungs, much the same way you'd shout at a deaf person or the dog you thought you could train to stay off the sofa... Easy French is rooted in the premise that, if properly packed, the rest of the world could fit within the confines of Reno, Nevada.\\"<br />\\"The card (in the hotel bathroom) reported the amount of water used every year in hotel laundry rooms and suggested that, in having my sheets and towels changed on a daily basis, I was taking this precious water directly from the cupped hands of a dehydrated child.

He could almost feel the cigarette tar freezing into little black icicles in his lungs as he desperately sucked in the frigid air and tried to keep up with Darby.\\"<br />Such is the hero of FREE FALL, a regular, out-of-shape shmoe like the rest of us, who finds himself, a disgraced FBI agent on suspension, hired by someone unknown to track down Darby Moore. Darby is the world's greatest female mountain climber, who stands accused of hacking her boyfriend to death with an ice ax. (Messy!) But, wait! Maybe things aren't what they seem. What's in that stolen FBI file, marked \\"Prodigy\\", in her backpack? And, what's the connection to David Hallorin, the up and coming third party candidate for Prez, and his psycho PR hack, Roland Peck?<br />The plot of this political thriller by Kyle Mills is fairly standard stuff. However, the Darby and Beamon characters put FREE FALL on a cut above the usual fare. Darby, at twenty-seven, has successfully ignored the rest of the material world to spend her life bumming about doing what she enjoys most - climbing, kayaking, skiing, bicycling - while existing on a shoestring and the handouts of corporate sponsors. Or, as Beamon soon realizes, \\"live for six months on thirty-eight cents and a couple of fruit roll-ups\\". In contrast, Mark is a maverick FBI agent, never advanced beyond middle-management, who possesses a wry sense of self and the consistent ability to vex his superiors. He's also a first-rate tracker of fugitives. In a way, it's too bad this book is more about Mark than Darby. The latter's character should have been developed more and given additional press time.<br />This is the third novel in the author's Beamon series. I was sufficiently impressed to order the second, STORMING HEAVEN. I'm always on the lookout for a good fictional hero. There are so few in real life.	2001-05-17
2003620:US	53075086	R1N99C9PKQCE8Y	0060958391	419435894	The Women Who Wrote the War	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Ladies with typewriters elbow their way to the front	Waging slaughters has traditionally been considered Guy Stuff. So, too, the reporting of them. THE WOMEN WHO WROTE THE WAR, by Nancy Sorel, is the story of the female war correspondents who, working for various U.S. newspapers and wire services, shoved their way to the battlefronts of World War II, making that conflict, especially in its latter stages, the first to be equally reported by both sexes.<br />By her own admission, the author cut fully half of the female reporter roster from the book so as not to render it unwieldy. Even then, the half remaining is an Honor Roll of the profession: Helen Kirkpatrick, Margaret Bourke-White, Lee Carson, Ruth Cowan, Lee Miller, Martha Gellhorn, Catherine Coyne, Virginia Irwin, Iris Carpenter, Annalee Jacoby, Mary Welsh, Dickey Chapelle, Sonia Tomara, Shelley Mydans, Pat Lochridge, and a host of others too numerous to mention here.<br />Beginning roughly with the Spanish Civil War, and finishing with the months immediately after WWII, the book's chapters are a series of snapshots in which Sorel's subjects appear or not, depending on their presence in the theater of conflict being described - and they all seem to move around a lot. So, in sequential order, one reads of reporting Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia, the attack on Poland, the fall of France, the Blitz, the Nazi assault on the Soviet Union, the war in China, the Japanese capture of the Philippines, the North African and Italian campaigns, D-Day, the liberation of Paris, the Battle of the Bulge, the Pacific islands war, the advance into Germany, the American-Russian link-up, the liberated concentration camps, V-E Day, and, finally, the surrender of Japan.<br />I can't give WOMEN WHO WROTE THE WAR a 5-star rating because the number of players was too excessive. It would've been better had Sorel focused on, say, just 3 or 4 correspondents in each theater (Europe and the Pacific) as representative of the whole. As it was, so many names kept popping in and out of the narrative that it was hard to \\"get to know\\" any one of them, though some are better introduced than others. However, taken as written, this is an admirably comprehensive look at the gutsy ladies that did what they had to do to bring the stories back home to readers in America. For example, Virginia Irwin obtained one of the biggest scoops of the war by deliberately defying a specific SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces) restriction on correspondents' movements in a certain area.

Fearing that her disappearance will be interpreted as foul play, with himself the murderer, Max goes on the lam to escape the Law and find out what really happened to his gal pal. I mean, what was with that huge flock of birds (right out of a Hitchcock film) that appeared shortly before Ellen's dramatic exit? From this point, the storyline takes Thorn to Florida, and the reader into a hopeless mish-mash involving a rogue Navy unit, attacking owls, huge schools of magically appearing dolphins, ley lines of energy crisscrossing the Earth, a Chasm of Nothingness, reference to the USS Eldridge and the \\"Philadelphia Experiment\\", parallel existences, a mysterious Blue Light, displaced animal species, somehow-significant flute music, and ... oh, never mind.<br />It's been several months since I've read a book with a plot so nebulous and disconnected as this one. It doesn't help that the ending is utterly incoherent, while doing nothing to answer any of the questions that arise from events occurring up to that point. One is just left with a confused \\"Huh?\\"<br />As I began the last fifty or so pages of VANISHED, I thought that I might at least be able to recommend the book as something mindless to read on a long airplane flight instead of the Safety Instructions in the seat-back jammed up against your knees.

From this vantage point, she's written REFLECTIONS IN BULLOUGH'S POND, a history of the manner in which the human residents of New England have exploited their environment, first for simple survival, then economic gain, from the time of the paleo-hunters 10,000 years ago to the present.<br />In hardcover, REFLECTIONS is not a particularly thick volume - exclusive of Notes and Index, only 258 pages. However, the print is small and the scope large. There are also a large number of maps, charts, graphs, drawings, and b/w photos to break up the text and give the reader's eyes some variety. The list of topics is the roadmap of the region's economic development, diversification, and spotty decline: the evolution of farming from hunting/gathering, the native Indians' use of forest and fauna, the arrival of the Europeans and the extermination of the area's tribes by disease, Yankee shipbuilding and ocean commerce, land shortages, and the advent of sawmills and shoemaking. Further into the book, one reads about itinerant peddlers, ice exports, the expansion of roads/canals/railroads, machines that make other machines..., the production of charcoal, and the disappearance of indigenous animal species....  Then, as the Industrial Revolution takes firm grip, one learns of cotton mills, steam power, the grinding-up of the forests by the paper mills, the rise and fall (due to water pollution) of oyster harvesting, and the fishing industry, especially King Cod. Finally, Ms. Muir laments the deleterious changes in the ecosystem brought on by acid rain, the increase in greenhouse gasses, and the losses of topsoil andozone.<br />... Diana has produced a scholarly, excellently researched book that's consistently informative and interesting. (It's also only rarely entertaining in the sense of being fun, so, if that's the requirement, perhaps the latest potboiler from Grisham, King or Cornwell is a better choice of the moment.)<br />As I recall, it was an email from Ms. Muir that brought REFLECTIONS to my attention.

In this work of alternative history by Eric Flint, a circular area of West Virginia six miles in diameter, and including the town of Grantville (pop. 3,000 or so), is suddenly transported from its place in the 20th century to a parallel universe in the year 1632 AD, and dropped intact into an identically shaped hole in the landscape of the German principality of Thuringia - right in the middle of that then-ongoing carnage called the Thirty Years War. Since the Americans are now left to their own resources without the ability to \\"call home\\" for help, this could've been an off-beat and gripping survival story had it been developed properly. Unfortunately, it wasn't, and it just came out being ridiculous.<br />In an Author's Afterword, Flint says that &quot;1632&quot; is a \\"sunny book\\". That's the problem. For our castaways, there are no clouds in the sky, no matter what the situation. First of all, the collective consternation of the citizens over losing their place in the modern present was no greater than if they'd been stranded in Newark after having missed a plane. I mean, where were the cries of outrage as the trips to see the grandkids in California, the vacations to DisneyWorld, the opportunity to see \\"I Love Lucy\\" reruns, and the 401k retirement plans, are all lost forever? Rather, our square-jawed and unrelentingly self-righteous American heroes spend their time rescuing damsels-in-distress from the marauding mercenary bands of the period, and otherwise imposing civil order and the U.S. federal political structure on a world in serious disarray. Teddy Roosevelt couldn't have done it better with his Big Stick approach. (Modern hunting rifles, plus the M-60 machine gun good ol' Frank has stashed in his backyard, don't hinder the clean-up, either, as lines of armored men with pikes are mowed down. Yee-haw, boys, I guess we showed them varmints a thing or two!) And then, of course, there are all the True Loves conveniently discovered as the Grantville singles fraternize with the natives. Indeed, the principal American strongman in this fun, Mike, finds his (on page 43 already) in a wooden stagecoach lurching down a local cart track pursued by thugs. I mean, it's just all so sugary sweet that I was tempted to send out for Kleenex, insulin and an air-sickness bag, not really sure which I'd need first.<br />And how about those unwashed local yokels, huh? As various elements become socially and militarily allied with those amazing Americans, does any individual among the former ever ask who won the Thirty Years War according to 20th century history books? (If 22nd century Wall Street suddenly dropped onto your back patio, wouldn't you at least want to know the future of that new gene technology IPO?) And are they particularly in awe of 20th century technological advances? Yawn. Without spilling too much of the plot, I can safely reveal that, at one point, our 17th century cousins, without having given it too much thought, are cozily sitting around the TVs chortling as Grantville's local programming is miraculously brought back on the air. (Hey, does anybody want to order out for some KFC before the game show starts?) All the comforts of a futuristic home.<br />There's only one element amidst this silliness that justified my finishing the book. It's the part describing the Thirty Years War and its greatest warrior-hero, King Gustav II Adolf of Sweden. A cursory examination of the war's history on an on-line encyclopedia was enough to show that the background material supplied in &quot;1632&quot; was at least superficially accurate, so I may have learned something of value while reading this oversized comic book. From beginning to end, the plot is just too pat and too shallow.

For me, the thirty-some tales in this book follow a normal distribution curve. My criteria for judging any on-the-road reminiscence are that it be sufficiently descriptive to make me want to visit the place myself (or not), and preferably contain lighthearted elements. (If one can't see the humor in mishaps far from home, he/she will certainly go nuts.) Thus, a few are terrific; a few are positively dismal; and most are just OK. Therefore, my three-star rating. It didn't help that there's no table of contents, a fact that I found annoying for no reason that I can logically defend.<br />First, let me mention some of the best of the lot. Susan Hack's lament (\\"Tampax Nightmares\\") on the pitfalls to finding tampons in Third World countries, and Yemen in particular, was hilarious. (Here, I guess I must admit to being an Insensitive Male.) The essay by Mary Roach (\\"The Last Tourist In Mozambique\\") on her interview with that island's President, during which transcendental meditation was discussed and practiced, left me with little doubt as to why that country is in such a wretched condition. Don George's recollection of the family vacation (\\"Conquering Half Dome\\") with wife and two kids simply reinforced my intention never to attempt the feat myself - I'm sufficiently afraid of heights. While reading Lucy McCauley's \\"Expatriate, With Olives\\", I could feel the sun in my face and the olives in my hand as she stripped the latter from their branches in southern Spain. When Simon Winchester drives a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit across Europe (\\"Romance In Romania\\"), the reaction this magnificent car elicits in a young woman in a dingy Romanian border town is positively poignant. Laura Fraser's getaway to the island of Ischia (\\"Italian Affair\\") is, perhaps, what the rest of us can only dream about during a normal day's silent desperation.<br />Of course, there's the other end of the curve. Wendy Belcher's treatise (\\"Out Of Africa\\") examining the opening lines and themes common to a number of travel books on Africa was so excruciatingly ho-hum that I couldn't finish it - the only chapter so dishonored. Barry Yeoman's overwhelming need (\\"Embraced In Spain\\") to be adopted by the local crowd in C&aacute;diz, in spite of his nervous stutter and half-out-of-the-closet gay lifestyle, verges on the pathetic. (The fact that he was unconditionally accepted by a group of locals makes for a warm and fuzzy, politically correct ending. But, it was hard to care.) David Downie's record (\\"Philosophy Au Lait\\") of the low drama in a Parisian philocaf&eacute; was so much trivial prattle. (But, then, my shallow character has never concerned itself with life's deeper meanings.) Finally, Karl Greenfeld's self-absorbed jaunt through angst (\\"Fear, Drugs, and Soccer In Asia\\") left me hoping he would just snap out of it.<br />There were quite a few \\"just OK\\" chapters, but I'll let you discover those for yourself. Indeed, someone else reading WANDERLUST will likely observe a distribution curve much different than mine - perhaps one skewed to the 1-star or 5-star end of the scale. For me, there was enough good stuff between the covers to make the book ultimately enjoyable. In the end, that's all I really ask.desperation.<br />Of course, there's the other end of the curve.

Daniel offered hundreds of dots and I connected them, until the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen emerged, my angel in the trenches; my incantation against despair. My Julia.\\"<br />Ten years after the Armistice, in 1928, Patrick returns to France to attend a memorial for his comrades who died twisting in the German barbed wire during an assault on the Hindenberg Line. Unexpectedly, Julia is there, searching through the 152 names engraved on the granite monument, until her fingers stop at ... Daniel's. Partrick approaches, somehow knowing it's Her though they've never before met.<br />(\\"Julia Julia. What are you doing to me?

I hate that.<br />Dr./Detective Alex Cross, a Washington DC forensic psychologist/gumshoe and his partner, John Sampson, are assigned to investigate a double kidnapping with the FBI and Secret Service. The victims are Michael and Maggie, the former the young son of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, and the latter the young daughter of a movie star. Very early on, the reader knows the identity of the perp, a brilliant serial killer named Gary Soneji, and Michael's fate. As Gary continues his murderous swathe across the landscape, all wonder. How do we catch this guy, and where's Maggie?<br />The best thing about this thriller is Cross, a world-weary widower who loves his kids and his grandmother, and who's not afraid to be, in the honorable tradition of Eastwood's Dirty Harry, a thorn in the side of his boss and the mayor. You gotta love the guy. Also, the Maggie character was endearing, but author James Patterson gave her too little press time.<br />The main problem with the book is that, at 502 pages in paperback, it's about 50 too long. By the novel's end, Gary's essential evilness and the de rigueur plot twist have been diluted out by an overabundance of other bad guys and the relationship between Cross and Secret Service agent Jezzie Flanagan, which Patterson develops ad nauseam. Moreover, for the apparent sake of maintaining the potential for a series, a major thread is left hanging. It's as if the author, or his editor, didn't know when to quit. Less would have been better.<br />The movie version of ALONG CAME A SPIDER was recently released, starring Morgan Freeman. From the trailers I've seen, the film adaptation seems to be a different story entirely. (Gee, what a surprise!)

Accompanying them everywhere over her 18-year lifespan was Henrietta, the family feline, herself a native of New York City. Amazingly adaptable, Henrietta coped with airplane baggage holds, Nile River rats, Hadeda ibises, African ants, a People's Liberation Army veterinarian, and a scarcity of kitty litter. At the same time, she developed a taste for caviar, cockroaches, yellow fish, cabbage, prosciutto, sturgeon, herbal tea bags, and gongbao jiding.<br />Considering the timespan and distances covered, this book is relatively short at 200 pages. The devotion and affection that the Wren family has for their furry pal is striking, as when Chris drags a 26-pound sack of cat litter home to litterless Beijing from Hong Kong. Or the distress the family feels when Henrietta goes missing for several weeks in Cairo. Though sometimes Chris lapses into a newsreporter's matter-of-factual style, the humor and poignancy of life with Kitty in exotic places always shows through. For example, in bed after being assaulted by Soviet security goons, Chris writes:<br />\\"And then I felt something hop softly on the bed. I opened my eyes and saw Henrietta ... She liked to curl up with the children and (wife) Jaqueline, but had never seen fit to favor me with such a visit ... Then I heard her purr. I reached down and lightly caressed the soft fur along her neck. She snuggled in tighter until my sore mouth and gut no longer throbbed. There is something consoling about stoking a pet when you feel frightened and alone. For the first time, it was clear that Henrietta and I belonged together.\\"<br />I've not been worked over by Red thugs.

You know, Square-Jawed Good Guy vs. Despicable Bad Guy - that sort of thing. Grisham's THE BRETHREN is the first novel I can remember reading in a very long time, if ever, that has no protagonist. Maybe he's now trying to write about real life where there're more gray areas.<br />Joe Roy Spicer, Hatlee Beech and FinnYarber are, respectively, a former Mississippi Justice of the Peace, a former Texas federal judge, and a former California Supreme Court Chief Justice. All three are in a minimum security Federal pen in Florida for various peccadilloes. And all three are using the US mail system to blackmail middle-aged homosexual men they've enticed out of the closet with a phony advert in a gay magazine. Helping them is their sleazy lawyer, Trevor Carson, who, for a cut of the take, acts as their link to the Postal Service.<br />On a seemingly unrelated track, Teddy Maynard is the unscrupulous, crippled Director of the CIA who has decided that the US needs a stronger military. To achieve this, he proposes to a relatively unknown Arizona Congressman, Aaron Lake, that he, Lake, enter the recently begun presidential primaries on a Double-the-Defense Budget platform. Aaron, a shameless political opportunist, is malleable and accepts, the task made easier by the tens of millions of dollars that Teddy manipulates into his campaign coffers. One of the main reasons that Maynard has selected Lake is the latter's apparent freedom from human foibles. Aaron apparently has no skeletons in his closet.<br />The reader knows all this thirty pages into the book, and unless he/she hasn't been paying attention, can predict where the plot is going.<br />It's not that THE BRETHREN is uninteresting or slow paced. It's just that all involved - Spicer, Beech, Yarber, Carson, Maynard, and Lake - are all so ... unsavory. I didn't wish any of them well even to the slightest degree. Any fascination the plot engenders is simply from observing the two camps collide.<br />So, despite what I learned in English Lit, not every novel has a protagonist.

The fact that the author, Annie, knew nothing about rose grafting possibly reflects youth's eternal optimism. In any case, the rose season over, the two sisters are gently maneuvered by a crafty local into purchasing a derelict farmhouse amidst the olive groves above the town.<br />The book spans at least a decade's worth of memories, and it's not always clear when in that timespan a particular incident occurred. However, it doesn't matter. One of the delights of EXTRA VIRGIN is the personality of Annie. She comes across as a genuinely Nice Person, and with that dry British wit that I personally find so engaging.  The reader is invited into her life as she and Lucy labor to refurbish their new home and tidy up - an understatement - their neglected garden and terraced olive groves. And, all the while, coping with the eccentricities, prejudices and habits of their Ligurian neighbors, and vice versa, as the two cultures meet and meld. By the end of the book, Annie and Lucy have successfully become an accepted part of their adopted community.<br />The book may drag a little in the last couple of chapters. Beforehand, however, we learn from Annie how olives are harvested and olive oil produced, as well as how local wine is made and mushrooms gathered. (The Italian love of food, in gargantuan quantities, is well portrayed.) And let's not forget the tales of the abandoned Morris, the matchless benefits of powdered lime, the water tank, and, during the tidying-up of the garden, ...the Snake:<br />\\"This horrible thing appeared to me as I was sitting under the lemon tree ... gazing focused and abstracted at the foliage below me moving gently in the sea breeze... One tall stalk that seemed oddly out of rhythm with the rest gradually drew my attention... Some sinister kind of long skinny snake was sitting among the tall grass, waving its top half around, cunningly camouflaged as a bit of plant life and hoping, I suppose, to catch some unwary plump insect... not just a concealed snake, but an actively duplicitous snake. We didn't need any of that sort of behavior so close to home... We set off a-sickling with renewed vim and mild hysteria, stamping about heavily to scare off serpent life as we went.\\"<br />I wish I could meet Annie.

An ex-police office himself, Lowen writes in a style reminiscent of another cop-turned-scribbler, Joseph Wambaugh.<br />Officer Sam Wright is a uniformed patrol officer in 1980's Seattle. His morning beat is the north end of FIRST AVENUE - particularly, and for the purpose of the plot, around the Pike Place Market. In the book, the avenue is only just beginning to be rehabilitated into its present day tourist and shopping mecca. In Sam's world, it's still on the sleazy, pre-Starbucks edge. In this context, Officer Wright becomes involved with the probe into the death of a young infant, apparently left by its mother, Alberta, to die of dehydration in a squalid hotel room. Having had a previous fleeting contact with the mother and baby, and convinced that the abandonment was not intentional, Wright is convinced that Alberta is also the victim of foul play. Soon, his investigations focus on a crummy donut shop across from the Market's entrance run by a slimeball named Pierre. No Winchell's here.<br />This is one of those books about which I'm feeling guiltily ambivalent. In remaining true to my own feelings, I'm afraid of being unfair. On one hand, Clausen has skillfully drawn characters that are sympathetic to the reader. The storyline accurately emphasizes the low key, almost non-existent, drama of a big city police beat, and the relationships that a beat cop will establish with the everyday citizens, both good and bad, that inhabit his territory. In FIRST AVENUE, the crime under investigation is almost incidental. It's certainly quaint when compared to the sensational crimes that flood 21st century newspapers, and which serve as the fodder for so many other crime thrillers. Intellectually, I can say that the author did a first-rate job recreating the physical and human environment of that Seattle location at that point in time. On the other hand, my eyelids, which kept closing every ten pages or so as I was reading, tell me that perhaps the book is just too low key. Maybe it's just me, too jaded from previous potboilers with way-too-clever endings and an excess of unlikely action.<br />I suspect that Clausen intends FIRST AVENUE to be the first in a series featuring Wright and the three women in his life: fellow cop Katherine, married girlfriend and next door neighbor Georgia, and Alaskan expat Maria - especially Maria. If that's the case, I'll likely buy the next in the series, but do hope that Lowen picks up the pace a bit.me that perhaps the book is just too low key.

Fraser's narrative history of his personal contribution to this campaign is QUARTERED SAFE OUT HERE.<br /><br />Written decades after the fact, this book does not pretend to be a comprehensive history of the Burma Theater in the last months of World War II. Rather, it's the war from the perspective of Nine Section in which Fraser fought, first as a Private, then Lance Corporal. (A \\"section\\" is the smallest operating unit of an infantry platoon, i.e. 8-10 men.) Besides being a vivid retelling of the author's recollections to the extent that he remembers, it's also an intimate portrait of the organization, weapons, tactics and camaraderie of the British Army at section level at that time, place, and conflict. It's a story told with the humor, intelligence and introspection that comes with maturity and hindsight. And, though some of Fraser's bitterness towards his old foe occasionally shows, age does dull the sharp edges.<br /><br />\\"I remember watching, a year or two ago, televised interviews with old Japanese soldiers who had fought in the war ... sitting in their gardens in their sports shirts, blinking cheerfully in the sunlight, reminiscing in throat-clearing croaks about battles long ago. It crossed my mind: were any of you on the Pyawbwe slope, and lived to tell the tale? Well, if they did, at this time of day I don't mind.\\"<br /><br />Fraser is a truly gifted writer.  After VJ Day, he applied for, and was awarded, a commission as a subaltern (2nd Lieutenant) in a Scottish Highland division posted to the Middle East. In this capacity, his experiences served as the basis for his quite wonderful and comedic McAuslan series of fictional stories (collected and available from Amazon.co.uk in THE COMPLETE MCAUSLAN). I unreservedly recommend both of these two books to anyone who has ever served in any branch of the armed forces, no matter what country.

Each of those murdered has been found in her bathtub submerged in camouflage-green paint, with no evidence of a struggle or apparent cause of death. Initially, he FBI tries to enlist Reacher's co-operation by pretending he's the chief suspect. When that ruse falls flat, they indirectly threaten to have his current girlfriend tortured and murdered by a local sadist. I mean, is this the FBI of Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. that those of us old enough to remember all know and love? (The \\"FBI\\" was a TV series in the late 60's/early 70's, in which the House That Hoover Built was depicted as the righteous, square-jawed defender of God-blessed America from sea to shining sea.)<br />Inasmuch as Child has Jack pursuing a serial killer, this latest potboiler swerves close to becoming a conventional who-dunit. However, the usual excellence of a Reacher thriller is achieved by Jack's ability to stare down and outwit the Feds, carry on relationships (of a sort) with three very different women, and nail the Bad Guy besides. With a Man's Man like this, who needs Harry? The latter is definitely pass&eacute; and out to pasture in Carmel.<br />The absolutely very best thing about RUNNING BLIND is the plot twist identity of the Perp. Even Reacher himself is fooled for a brief moment. (\\"Say it ain't so, Joe!\\") Because of this, I must say that this is Child's finest effort to date.

Her vessel, and her command of it, were an element of THE PERFECT STORM book and movie, which told the tale of the sister ship \\"Andrea Gail\\", lost in a 1991 tempest off the East Coast.<br />In THE HUNGRY OCEAN, Linda invites the reader aboard the \\"Hannah Boden\\" for a 30-day fishing expedition to the Grand Banks, 1100 miles distant in the North Atlantic, during the month of September sometime in the mid-90s. Interspersed in the narrative of this particular voyage are Linda's memories from her childhood and previous sailings, all of which experiences contribute to make her one of the most successful swordfisherman on the ocean.<br />This is a memoir that's hard to put down. As I sat reading in the comfort of home with a pet cat in my lap, I was reminded how cushy a 9 to 5 indoor job is. Even if I was 30 years younger, I can't imagine enduring fourteen successive 20-hour days, each one of which is spent setting down, and then hauling-in, the 40-mile fishing line carrying 900 very sharp, baited hooks capable of catching several tons of thrashing swordfish (or unwanted, but dangerous, sharks). Especially if one is struggling to keep from falling overboard (much less stand upright) on a rolling deck in the face of 40-knot (or greater) winds, driving rain, and heaving seas. Just call me a landlubber with a capital \\"L\\". Proud of it, too!<br />Though I wouldn't have otherwise given much thought to the gender distinction, Greenlaw herself points out that being a female swordboat captain is unusual. Her obvious ability to handle a diverse, sometimes difficult, all-male deck gang of five, plus her talent for finding and bringing home the catch, inspires me to snap off a salute and call her \\"Cap'n\\" with all due admiration. If I was so inclined to enlist as part of a crew, I'd sail with her to anywhere.<br />This is a first-rate, salty yarn. Buy it, and you'll enjoy it. Now, where did I put that can of tuna?

The old blood flaked off metallic and lifeless on my desperate tongue.\\"<br />Such is the hunger of a vampire on the run, forced to take refuge in a derelict New York tenement, when a cheeseburger and fries aren't an option.<br />THIRST, like Michael Cecilione's previous work, MUSE, is the first-person story of a young woman whose unfulfilled sexual needs get her into hot water. In this case, Cassandra Hall narrates the storyline from two different perspectives in time, moving back and forth in alternating chapters. In one, she's a former, struggling window-dresser describing the events preceding and immediately subsequent to her transformation into a vampire by the tall, pale and handsome bloodsucker, Julian, who seduces her. In the second, it's a couple of years after her reincarnation, and she's on the run from the Advocates, a group of religious fanatics dedicated to ridding the world of the Undead, and from the Arbiters, an ancient race, alien to Earth, from whose mating with humans produced human vampires. In modern times, the Arbiters police the planet killing those of their unnatural progeny that have broken some sort of Vampire Law. (Cassandra's transgression remains only vaguely described, but it scarcely matters as the Arbiters never play major roles in the plot. The author's editor didn't do his job.) In any case, the two timelines merge at the end.<br />In MUSE, given a five-star rating by me on this website, the conclusion is devilishly clever and in-synch with the rest of the story. Unfortunately, while THIRST is a so-so horror fable, its finale almost seems more befitting another plot entirely. It's like Cecilione realized he needed to wrap it up, but didn't quite know how to manage it. Maybe it was pressure from the publisher to rush the novel into print that caused this lurch.<br />In case you're looking for a bedtime story to read the kids, this isn't it unless they're awfully precocious. The author has peppered the text with graphic scenes of violence, sex, and violent sex that are arguably gratuitous in nature.

Consider for a moment. He had to quell a nation-shattering rebellion. The top generals of his eastern armies were incompetent. He lost two of his young sons to disease. He had to persuade those states still loyal to accept two very controversial initiatives: a military draft and emancipation of blacks. His wife was a spendthrift and mentally unbalanced.<br />LINCOLN'S MEN examines Uncle Abe's relationship with the men of his armies, particularly those citizens that enlisted (or were drafted) into the states' volunteer regiments. Realizing that the officer corps took care of its own, his concern was chiefly spent on such issues important to the non-commissioned ranks, such as pay, fair military justice, length of enlistment, battlefield health care, and supply. Lincoln's office door was always open to anyone, even the most humble of privates, who had a petition or grievance to present. I find this last fact truly amazing when, today, the White House is a virtual fortress denying casual access to the most innocent of visitors.<br />The cynical might say that Lincoln was simply a politician, in the basest sense, currying favor with those whose efforts in the trenches might potentially fail to keep him in power. Indeed, while he was constantly visiting with and reviewing the troops of the eastern armies, particularly the hapless Army of the Potomac, he never once called on the western commands of Grant and Sherman because, after all, they were consistent winners. While this favoritism is glaring, the author, William Davis, presents it simply as a father caring for the most needy of his children. I agree. The affection Lincoln engendered in \\"his boys\\" in all military theaters of operation is evidenced by the vote they gave him in the election of 1864, and the tributes accorded him by veterans' groups in the decades following the war.

It wasn't until I read TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY and SMILEY'S PEOPLE, and then viewed the BBC's marvelous screen adaptations of these two books, that I came to appreciate the author's methodically intricate plot and character development that results in more of an identity profile of the chief protagonist than anything else. (For me, le Carr&eacute;'s Smiley will always bring to mind the features of Alec Guiness, who starred in the aforementioned BBC productions.) There are no Bond-like capers here, and those expecting such will become excruciatingly bored.<br />In THE CONSTANT GARDENER, Justin Quayle is a faceless, government bureaucrat attached to the British High Commission in Nairobi, Kenya. His job is to represent Her Majesty's government on an international committee of other faceless bureaucrats charged with monitoring the efficiency at which aid moneys for the poor and starving reach the intended recipients. The committee has no investigatory authority, so high level and endemic African venality is ignored. On the other hand, Justin's wife, Tessa, belongs to a private group that investigates corruption with a vengeance. Her efforts have uncovered the criminally negligent misuse of a new drug, Dypraxa, designed to treat tuberculosis. The drug's manufacturer, megapharmaceutical KVH, is trialing Dypraxa on the indigenous African population, and apparently covering up the drug's fatal side effects. As THE CONSTANT GARDENER opens, Tessa has been found murdered on a field trip into the African bush. Is there a link?<br />The storyline unfolds from three viewpoints. First and foremost, there's Justin, whose guilt over his hear-no -evil, see-no-evil detachment from his wife's investigations compels him to follow her lead posthumously, reopen the probe in the face of Foreign Office opposition, and attempt to discover the true circumstances of Tessa's demise. (Did KVH have her killed? Was the British government somehow involved?) Then, there are Sandy Woodrow, the ambitious and morally flaccid Head of Chancery for the Brits in Nairobi, and Gita Pearson, an Anglo-Indian admirer of Tessa's employed by the High Commission as a low-level functionary.<br />The novel's conclusion, like most of life, is painted in muted gray tones, not stark black and white as one might wish. It's certainly an unhappy ending, although that's appropriate considering the nature of Justin's internal demons brought on by his beloved's lonely death. Yet, the evil he confronts is both banal and ambiguous. Perhaps it's a tragedy of the 21st century that such is the nature of the baseness now pervasive in the world, not the more focused deviltry of Hitler, Stalin, or the Red Menace. I guess I'd have to say that I miss the good old days of the Cold War. That period enabled the author to script endings that were personally more satisfying, that of SMILEY'S PEOPLE being a case in point, which engendered more a sense of triumph of \\"good\\" over \\"evil\\". Thus, while THE CONSTANT GARDENER is meticulously crafted with the usual le Carr&eacute; penchant for excellence, for me it lacks punch. Where's George Smiley when you need him??)

Heaven knows, I've been disappointed often enough. CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC, by Sophie Kinsella, is a rare gem.<br />Rebecca Bloomwood is a single, twenty-something English lass with a serious problem. She shops beyond her means with a vengeance, blithely ignoring, sometimes discarding unread, the concerned letters from credit card issuers requesting payment. (The demands are very genteel, of course. Her creditors are British, after all.) Yet, she'll go into a panic at the prospect of losing the opportunity to buy a $540 designer scarf at two-thirds off. Ironically, Becky is also a financial journalist for the magazine \\"Successful Saving\\" - she advises readers on strategies for increasing their personal nest eggs.<br />Becky has every good intention of paying her debts, though spending an additional $300 in a single day on Stuff is not extraordinary. The fun of this book is watching her escape from impossible situations, or hemorrhage money, despite every scheme she devises to either save or earn more income. Between chuckles, you just want to slap her out of exasperation - for her own good. Two examples ...<br />Determined not to spend a Saturday on frivolous shopping, she decides to visit London's Victoria and Albert Museum, admission for which she thinks is free. (Save money and absorb culture, all in one go.) Unexpectedly faced with an $8 entrance fee, she purchases the $24 season ticket. Then, after trudging between exhibits, which, disappointingly, have no price tags attached, she discovers ... the Museum Gift Shop.<br />Hoping to land a banking position in the City, she sends off a suitably embellished CV to a high-powered head-hunting firm. So impressed is the agency with her professed abilities, including a totally fictional fluency in Finnish, that its representative, unbeknownst to Becky, arranges an on-the-spot and surprise meeting between her and the recruitment director for the Bank of Helsinki. (\\"I can't wait to hear the two of you talking away in Finnish,\\" chirps the rep.)<br />This book is particularly delightful because Becky is so endearing. OK, so she rationalizes away reality, and is shallow, immature and irresponsible. However, she's not a bad, malicious person, nor is she hard-core dishonest. She's actually quite pleasant - a most agreeable person with whom to spend the day ... well, shopping. For these reasons, I rooted for her all the way to the end, at which time my faith in her essential goodness was justified. You go, girl!r for the Bank of Helsinki.

He caught dizzying glimpses of earth, then black space, then earth again, as he flailed and twisted around in a frantic dance ... The wetness slithered into his ear.\\"<br />Bummer. Makes you want to swear off space walks.<br />According to the jacket of Tess Gerritsen's GRAVITY, Dr. Emma Watson finds herself aboard the International Space Station (ISS) facing a zero-gravity experiment gone bad, a culture of single-celled organisms run amok. The crew is infected one by one, with fatal results. The world's population is put at risk. The ISS is quarantined. O dear, how does our heroine survive and get home?<br />After the first third or so of this thriller, I was tempted to put it down, and write it off as a two-star effort. Too many of the elements seemed tired, potentially leading to a predictable plot. Beautiful, hotshot young doctor rockets into orbit before being able to sign divorce papers. Her estranged husband, also a hotshot physician, is an astronaut permanently grounded because of kidney stones. (He still loves her, of course.) A maverick U.S. company has developed a quick-turnaround alternative to the space shuttle. And, while the first prototype blew up on launch, the second is untested, but, hey, ready to fly. A mysterious, Southern California (where else?) research outfit that owns the haywire experiment knows more than it's telling. I admit that I'm probably jaded, but puhleeze!<br />Then the monster, so to speak, gets loose, and people starting dying in the most horrific manner. I mean, if you wake up some morning after an all night bender, look into the mirror and notice a severe case of bloodshot eyes, then you may as well run screaming into the street because you're not going to have a good week. Trust me.<br />While the storyline remained, as feared, fairly predictable, the Archaeon organism was so scary (and yucky!) that I was drawn into the plot almost against my will. So, Tess pulls out of her nosedive in the knick of time, and I'm happy to award 4 stars.

Their teeth were yellow, their skin lined and leathery. They wore no shoes. Everything about them suggested that they let nature just take its course.\\"<br />Such is the disconcerting observation concerning Sister Iphigenia, Sister Margarita, and Sister Carla by Father Ignatius in LAMBS OF GOD. (No immaculately white wimples here!) When I was a young lad attending Catholic elementary school, the nuns, though occasionally intimidating, were blessedly cut from different cloth.<br />Fr. Ignatius is the bishop's private secretary sent to reconnoiter the property of a deserted and forgotten island abbey (presumably in Ireland, though the book never states). The diocese wants to sell the site to a land developer, which has plans to create a posh resort. To the cleric's consternation, the abbey is still inhabited by the three named nuns and their flock of sheep. The sisters believe the sheep harbor the souls of the nunnery's deceased members. Isolation from the rest of the world has rendered the three just a little ... well, touched in the head, and their religious observances a peculiar blend of pagan and Christian. When Ignatius announces that the nuns are to be relocated and the sheep butchered, it doesn't go over well.<br />This novel by Marele Day is a gentle and low key fable of confrontation between the religious women, determined not to lose the only life they know, and the ambitious, young priest from the mainland. Managing to incapacitate the cleric and hold him incommunicado, it's their intent to \\"convert\\" him to their community lifestyle. On the other hand, Ignatius knows that to escape, he must divide and conquer, so to speak. In the course of this test of wills, we discover some deep and startling secrets harbored by the sisterhood. (It's a pointed reminder that beneath their habits and clerical garb, nuns and priests are \\"just folks\\". Perhaps this lesson is one of the novel's biggest strongpoints.)<br />While I like LAMBS OF GOD enough to recommend it, female readers will probably better appreciate it. The predicament in which our lone male hero finds himself is decidedly embarrassing, and not one to elicit much sympathy from passing Real Men. In recognition of this gender-based bias, I gave the book one more star than I would have otherwise. And this comes after accepting the precarious premise that the Holy Mother Church could lose total contact with a religious house - a material and financial asset, after all - and its residents during the last years of the 20th century when the storyline apparently unfolds.

However, there will be drier interludes.\\"<br />Thus might an English weathercaster ambiguously predict the day's weather, as noted in the first chapter of ENGLAND FOR ALL SEASONS, the third book in a series by travel essayist Susan Allen Toth on her ongoing romance with England and all things English. (The other two books in the series are MY LOVE AFFAIR WITH ENGLAND and ENGLAND AS YOU LIKE IT.)<br />Granted, for someone residing where the climate is livable year round, say Los Angeles, CA, such a weather prediction might not offer much inducement to make the eleven-hour trip across The Pond. However, if living in a place with beastly humid, hot summers and teeth-chatteringly frigid, snowy winters, say Downer's Grove, IL, there's a lot to be said for England's temperate climate, however uncertain its application.<br />ENGLAND FOR ALL SEASONS is chock full of so many of Susan's reminiscences and recommendations, all presented in her usual humorous and relaxed style, that it's hard to summarize the book without writing a review of similar length. The twenty-five chapters cover a multitude of topics. The art of garden visiting, and the temptations of the \\"sweet trolley\\", a.k.a. the restaurant dessert cart. Buying books in England, and the exploration of literary landscapes, i.e. the exploration of those locales in which the country's legion of authors lived and wrote about. \\"Lolloping\\" around London, perhaps best translated as a relaxed peregrination to the city's numerous attractions, including some of the major museums (Transport Museum, Imperial War Museum, Theatre Museum, National Portrait Gallery) and grand historic houses. Then there are those quirky depositories outside the capital devoted to the oddest of interests: bagpipes, thimbles, ceramics, plasterwork, waterways, oast houses, lawn tennis, stained glass, and (!) lawnmowers. Susan whisks us away on a tour of the Thames as it meanders its way through London. Then it's off to the Roseland Peninsula in Cornwall, the Scottish island of Mull (popular Skye's \\"shy sister\\"), and the Welsh island of Anglesey. If you're a creature lover, you'll be delighted on field trips to various animal sanctuaries for donkeys, otters, seals (near the village of Gweek), and owls.<br />It's apparent that the author escorts the armchair traveler well beyond England's boundaries deep into Wales and Scotland. This is not because England is wanting in things to do or see, but rather in recognition of the fact that many, if not most, of her fellow Americans are woefully insensitive to the distinction between England and Great Britain. Bloody Yanks.<br />I can conclude with no better than Susan's very words, because my several trips to the United Kingdom would cause me to advise the same:<br />\\"But, when I finish a book, I'm a little sad, too. Writing about my trips reminds me that they're over; I will never have exactly that experience again... Perhaps that touch of sadness has to do with my realization that places and people change.

She's also been carrying on a shameless affaire d'amour with England for some time. (Husband James, obviously an Enlightened Male, is tolerant.) In any case, her affection for that green and pleasant land makes her a soul mate of mine. I've devoured all three of her travel essay books on England, of which ENGLAND AS YOU LIKE IT is one. (The other two in the series are MY LOVE AFFAIR WITH ENGLAND and ENGLAND FOR ALL SEASONS.)<br />In an unpretentious, humorous, and thoroughly charming style, Susan shares a multitude of suggestions and experiences. How to independently create one's own English travel itinerary. The almost-sublime usefulness of the Ordnance Survey series of maps. (\\"These are distinctly royal maps. Each, in fact, carries a discrete notation:  \\"Made and published by Ordnance Survey, Southampton. Crown copyright\\".\\" The art of flying Coach. The case to be made for overpacking.

The practical aspects of keeping a travel journal. The joys of shopping locally for food, and eating \\"in\\".<br />Of course, she also shares some of her favorite places, beginning with the shire of Cornwall in general, and the town of Padstow and castle of St. Michael's Mount in particular. Then, it's on to Ashdown Forest (Winnie the Pooh Country) in East Sussex. Later, we stay with her and James at the Victorian country house of Standen. (\\"It is not easy to recline with aplomb in one's bath while receiving strangers, but James carried it off very well.\\") And, the small harbor town of Lynmouth in Devonshire, ominously referred to in a local guidebook. (\\"Beware the twin honey pots of Lynton and Lynmouth.\\") For those visitors with more esoteric tastes, there's London's National Postal Museum, at which one can pick up an application to join the Letter Box Study Group, whose avowed aim is \\"to accumulate and disseminate information on all aspects of Letter Boxes\\". While in London, she seeks out several of that city's secret public gardens. Then, for those of her fellow Yanks wretched enough to consider England and Great Britain synonymous, she includes two chapters on the Scottish Highlands, and another on two Scottish battle memorials: Culloden (1745), and the site of a B-24 crash in June 1945 on Fairy Loch.<br />Finally, I must to refer to Susan's thoughts at the very beginning of Chapter One because I myself have luxuriated in the experience before each of my several trips to England (and Scotland):<br />\\"Months before we leave for England, I begin to travel.

Never again.<br />In TIMELINE, International Technology Corporation, headed by a brilliant jerk, Robert Doniger, is doing research in advanced applications of Quantum Theory. Among other things, ITC has succeeded in creating the world's first quantum computer.<br />In southwest France, ITC is sponsoring the archeological excavation of a site that encompasses the ruins of two castles on opposite banks of the Dordogne River, plus those of an adjacent monastery and river mill. The excavation team leader, Professor Edward Johnston, begins to suspect that ITC knows more about the site than it's sharing, so he flies back to company headquarters near Santa Fe, NM, to demand answers. Within a couple days, the rest of the team loses phone contact with the professor, and (conveniently) discovers objects belonging to or originating with Johnston amidst the ruins, including a note that says, \\"Help me!\\" Trouble is, the objects can be dated as contemporary with the rubble in which they were found, i.e. mid 14th century. Upon reporting this to ITC, several members of the team are flown back to company HQ ASAP. There, they learn that ITC has achieved the capability of sending people between the parallel universes postulated by quantum mechanics, and that Johnston was transmitted to the Dordogne parallel, or \\"back in time\\". Unfortunately, ITC has since lost track of the professor, and a search team must be dispatched. (Up to this point, TIMELINE is marginally interesting. From here on, it degenerates.) The search team includes several members of Johnston's archeological crew: Professor Andr&eacute; Marek, Chris Hughes, and Kate Erickson. Andr&eacute; is the professor's second-in-command, a man obsessed with the Middle Ages, even to the point of being trained in the use of period weaponry. Chris and Kate are graduate students, i.e. upscale gofers.<br />There's so much wrong with this book, it's hard to know where to begin criticizing. First of all, Andr&eacute;, Chris and Kate remain unsympathetic characters. As crafted by Crichton, they're nothing more than functional warm bodies with names used as vehicles to advance the action. Within the storyline, they could be interchangeable, especially Kate and Chris. Second of all, the action itself seems so purposeless. All three, plus Johnston, have been dropped into the year 1357, during which time the castles, monastery and mill are the focus of a local war between two knights, neither of which are very nice men. The professor plays a hazy role as the ally or prisoner - it's not always clear which - of one of the two. (Indeed, Johnston remains an enigma from beginning to end.) To rescue their mentor, our three heroes spend their time confusedly scrambling over, under, and through the various buildings that they'd previously been excavating in the 21st century, all the while fending off assaults by assorted armored and chain-mailed thugs, or escaping imprisonment. Finally, there's the hint early on that ITC has a secret, menacing agenda. (After all, what red-blooded American corporation doesn't?) However, once revealed, this reader yawned and thought, \\"OK. So?\\"  Bill Gates and Microsoft have been painted as more sinister.<br />Not to put too fine a point on it, by the end of this novel I just didn't care if Johnston and his rescuers made it back or not. As a matter of fact, I say toss `em in a dungeon and swallow the key. Even the comeuppance visited upon Doniger is anticlimactic and hardly worth the page space it occupies. Hindsight tells me that I wasted my money./>There's so much wrong with this book, it's hard to know where to begin criticizing. First of all, André, Chris and Kate remain unsympathetic characters.

While the decisive battles were fought in Mexico's interior by Gen. Winfield Scott, additional posturing and skirmishes played out in that country's neglected northwestern province.<br />BEAR FLAG RISING is a solid, comprehensive narrative history of the events that brought California into the Union; events that, if they hadn't been taken so seriously by the participants, could have served as the script for a farce. Certainly, all the Keystone Cops were present for the American side: Gen. Stephen Kearny, Commodore Robert Stockton, and Lt. Col. John Fr&eacute;mont. The Mexican side was only marginally better represented, although they at least had the honor of being the aggrieved underdogs: Gov. Pio Pico, Gen. Jos&eacute; Castro, Andr&eacute;s Pico, and Jos&eacute; Flores.<br />The book begins with a brief history of the Spanish and Mexican custodianships of California, and the rise of the Californios, i.e. the actual residents, when the central government in Mexico City decided to leave the province to its own resources. The bulk of the text, of course, recounts the disjointed efforts of the opportunistic Fr&eacute;mont, the puffed-up Stockton, and the martinet Kearny to effect a conquest. (At least Fr&eacute;mont had the charm of being an officer of the U.S. Topographical Corps rather than a \\"real\\" army man.) The fact that they succeeded at all is more a commentary on the Mexicans' pitiful lack of preparedness and resources than any competence on the part of the U.S. forces. To underline the dysfunction of the American effort, author Dale Walker concludes with a chapter detailing the subsequent court-martial of Fr&eacute;mont on charges of mutiny and insubordination brought by Kearny.<br />BEAR FLAG RISING is competently researched, well written, instructional, reasonably entertaining, and sobering. Would I advocate a return of the Golden State to Mexico? Well, decidedly not. California has prospered as part of the Union more than it ever would have under successive corrupt and incompetent Mexican governments. However, as an American and Californian, I'm not particularly proud about the strategy and tactics that resulted in its acquisition.entertaining, and sobering.

However, as an American and Californian, I'm not particularly proud about the strategy and tactics that resulted in its acquisition.	2001-02-01

He's fathered 4 sons (William, Tom, Guy, and Dorian) by three different wives, all now dead. Yearning for one last seafaring exploit, he accepts a commission from the reigning British monarch, William III, and the East India Company to mount a punitive expedition to the Indian Ocean to eradicate a band of cutthroat pirates, led by the evil Jangiri, that have lately taken sore toll of Company shipping and profits. So, leaving his heir, William, to manage the family holdings, Hal sails away on the \\"Seraph\\" with his three youngest sons and his three old comrades from BIRDS, Aboli, Ned Tyler and Big Daniel, to confront the buccaneers off the coast of East Africa in the waters surrounding the Spice Islands.<br />During the first several pages of MONSOON, we're introduced to son Tom, who's persuaded a saucy scullery maid to share her amorous favors with him and his fraternal twin Guy, while the younger Dorian stands watch. And where is this steamy tryst taking place? Why, on his grandfather's sarcophagus in the burial crypt of the estate chapel, of course. This startling introduction of Tom to the reader should presage the fact that, by the end of the book, he's the main character and hero. Well, subtlety is not one of author Wilbur Smith's strongpoints.<br />I sometimes think that Smith develops his plots by stream of consciousness writing. He zigzags flamboyantly from one outrageous situation to the next. In the MONSOON storyline, Hal, Tom and their faithful companions go from sea to land, and back again, doing all that Guy Stuff that Manly Men do: seducing (or being seduced by) willing young beauties, battling with corsairs and slavers, rescuing damsels in distress, capturing much treasure, slaughtering infidels, vanquishing assorted evil doers in single combat, and killing elephants for their tusks. (This last activity will outrage African wildlife preservationists everywhere.) However, whether the tapestry of his tale calls for bravery, cowardice, fratricide, homicide, vengeance, love, lust, betrayal, loyalty, greed, generosity, or just plain serendipity, Smith weaves with a panache and energy that make for fabulous escapist reading.<br />MONSOON has an ending that I thought just a bit too precipitate. But, it's evidence of another sequel in the works. And, even though I'll be the first to admit that this series is pure trash, I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to the next volume.ing assorted evil doers in single combat, and killing elephants for their tusks.

Knowing that we're cat people, friends tend to give us gifts with that relationship in mind. I wish they or we would snap out of it, because some of the Stuff, while well meant, is way too cute or too tacky, or both. (Instead, Amazon gift certificates are always welcome  - hint, hint!) However, one offering, CATS IN THE SUN, was well received, and is much appreciated.<br />This is a coffee table tome with five pages of introductory text. Then, on each of the following 137, not a solitary word is printed, but rather a single, rich, 5.5 X 8.25-inch color photograph. The images were all taken by Hans Silvester on the sun drenched Greek islands of Mykonos, Milos and Naxos, where large populations of domestic cats run semi-wild. While the islands' inhabitants allow none indoors, the animals are tolerated, and sometimes actively cared for, with a detached affection. In return, the rodent populations are suppressed with a vengeance.<br />Too many books and calendars featuring kitty pictures are cloyingly cute, usually because they tend to emphasize kittens. Refreshingly, this book is not. It features cats, both kittens and adults, in unstaged, natural situations. Cats on streets, steps, rooftops, harbor quays, walls, tree limbs, rocks, chairs, ledges and pathways. Cats sleeping, lounging, climbing, washing, eating, hunting, leaping, courting, fighting, carousing, watching, sitting, exploring, running and walking. Cats alone. Cats in pairs. Cats in groups. Rarely, cats with people or dogs. Short and long-haired cats, in all sizes, colorations and fur patterns. I think Silvester burned through a lot of film.<br />Among all the glorious pigments, textures, patterns, sunbeams and shadows, I have two favorite images. One, a group of seven cats, all with tails raised and end-curled, walking along with a local codger who is carrying something edible in a plastic sack. (I know it's edible, because that's what our owners look like at six in the morning as I carry the can of TigerChow to the opener.) The other, a cat standing on its hind legs, inquisitively peering into the lower end of a roof's downspout. Then, there are those two curious photos, one of a man painting the base of a wall, the other of some sun-dappled steps, in which no cat is visible at all. Am I (not) seeing the local Cheshire Cat?<br />I consider most coffee table books as useful as Christmas fruitcakes. (You know, the ones with those hateful little green bits.) However, if you like cats, then CATS IN THE SUN is worth savoring.our owners look like at six in the morning as I carry the can of TigerChow to the opener.)

Author Paco Underhill, the founder of a research and consulting firm that advises businesses on how to boost sales, has written an engaging revelation on the ways vendors can design their merchandising operations and locations to better relieve you of your fluid assets. (It's not quite as cynical as I've made it sound, because, after all, shoppers are willing participants in the retail dance. We all like to acquire Stuff.)<br />Underhill covers a lot of ground, most of which shoppers rarely notice or consider: the placement of signage, the width of shopping aisles, the height of shelving, the importance of having two hands free, the shopping habits of men vs. those of women, the influence of kids, the critical importance of the five senses in evaluating goods, buying habits of the youthful vs. the aged, the point size of type on packaging, traffic flow patterns within stores, the location of the cash/wrap stations, the placement of promotional materials, the advantages/disadvantages of Web selling, and more.<br />The subject matter could've made Underhill's narrative, however informative, also as dry as peanut butter-covered graham crackers without milk. Happily, the author exhibits a wry sense of humor that makes WHY WE BUY worthy of casual reading. Two examples follow to give you the flavor of it.<br />When discussing the reinvention of certain household products so as to appeal to men: \\"The manliest monikers used to go on cars; now they go on suds. A very successful soap introduction in the `90s wasn't anything frilly or lavender. It was Lever 2000, a name that would also sound right on a computer or a new line of power tools. I'd drive a Lever 2000 any day.\\"<br />Regarding the absence of seating for the use of menfolk while their ladies shop in a certain apparel store, and the male solution: \\" ... they gravitated toward a large window that had a broad sill at roughly the height where a bench would be. And where exactly was this ad hoc bench? ... It was immediately adjacent to a large and attractive display of the Wonderbra ... On the day we visited the store, there were two elderly gents loitering there, unabashedly discussing the need for Wonderbras of every woman who was brave enough to stop and shop. Did I mention that few Wonderbras were purchased there that day?\\"<br />I doubt if having read this book will raise my awareness of the subtle stratagems by which retailers hope to have the opportunity to swipe my plastic, but it was worth a chuckle nevertheless.ge window that had a broad sill at roughly the height where a bench would be.

Nevertheless, in August 1912 the Russian ship \\"Saint Anna\\", with 25 men and one female nurse aboard, set sail from Murmansk for Vladivostok (7,000 miles distant via the Northeast Passage), with the expressed purpose of discovering new Arctic hunting grounds. By mid-October, the vessel was trapped in the ice, and, for the next 18 months, drifted helplessly northwards. In April of 1914, ten of the crew and the ship's navigator, Valerian Albanov, despairing of the vessel's eventual release, voluntarily left their shipmates in an attempt, with kayaks and sledges, to reach the Franz Josef island group somewhere to their south. IN THE LAND OF WHITE DEATH, subsequently written by Albanov, is based on his diary of the 3-month, 235-mile odyssey over the ice pack, frigid water and deserted island shores to reach Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, from which point he anticipated rescue.<br />There are many points of similarity between this book and ENDURANCE: SHACKLETON'S INCREDIBLE VOYAGE, by Alfred Lansing, which describes the same sort of gritty survival journey achieved by Sir Ernest Shackleton and his 27 men after their ship, \\"Endurance\\" was trapped and crushed by Antarctic ice in 1915 during an abortive attempt to reach the South Pole. Notwithstanding the facts that Shackleton was a more charismatic leader, that Shackleton's men were of better mettle, and that their journey to safety was over a longer distance, the Albanov narrative remains a gripping, tautly told account of men against the elements. One of its chief attractions, for those with short attention spans or too many books to read, is its brevity --190 pages in small-format hardcover. Sadly, there is no photo section (as is included in ENDURANCE).<br />One might wonder why this tale took so long to be noticed by the reading public as opposed to various accounts of the Shackleton ordeal. Perhaps it's because it first had to be translated from Russian, or because Albanov, unlike Shackleton, died in obscurity, or because Shackleton was already a figure of some fame by 1915. Or because all of the Endurance's crew came back alive, while the Saint Anna's crew, well ...

Wishing to learn more about this horrific struggle, I sought out this book, STALINGRAD, a narrative history of the fight authored by Antony Beevor.<br />STALINGRAD begins, as it must, on June 21, 1941 with the launching of Operation Barbarossa, Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union by three Army Groups - North, Center and South. Beevor first summarizes from a wide perspective Army Group Center's attack on, and repulse from, Moscow, and Army Group South's surge towards the Volga River and the Caucasus Mountains. Then, the focus is narrowed onto the Sixth Army's and Fourth Panzer Army's drive to Stalingrad and the Volga in the summer of `42. The last three-quarters of the volume then limits itself to the Stalingrad siege, the Soviet counterattack on, and encirclement of, the Sixth and Fourth Panzer armies, their subsequent subjugation, and, finally, the fate of the 91,000 Germans taken prisoner. The main characters of the drama are all brought onto the stage: Hitler, Paulus, Schmidt, von Richthofen, Stalin, Zhukov, Yeremenko, Chuikov, and Rokossovsky.<br />This is a very reader-friendly account for the simple reason that the author supplies enough information, including maps, to keep the narrative moving along without getting bogged down in the minutiae of minor troop movements and a superabundance of unit designations. He's also included (in the paperback edition) two adequate sections of photographs - always a much appreciated touch. The volume met, if not exceeded, my expectations, and I learned a lot.<br />During the Siege, there was desperate heroism on both sides. But, it was also war at its most brutal in ways too many to recount. I shall finish with two excerpts, both regarding war prisoners, first from the Russian viewpoint, then the German.<br />\\" `When the (German) retreat started on 20 November, we (Soviet POWs) were put instead of horses to drag the carts loaded with ammunition and food.

Unfortunately, it's also difficult to coherently review because its impact is almost all in the ending, the last 20 pages. Not wanting to run afoul of Amazon's book review gendarme by submitting a \\"plot spoiler\\", I can only say that the conclusion's plot twist immediately brought to mind a Mobius Strip. (A geometrician - is that a real word? - might criticize me for the analogy, but that's what comes to mind.

Who is that masked man, anyway?<br />Faint clues to the direction of the storyline can be discerned in the following four excerpts:<br />On the plot of the initial book given to her by Matt, as described by Johanna: \\"But the book had everything: love, violence, sex, a resolute heroine, a twisted male lead, and a surprise ending.\\"<br />On the book's heroine, again as observed by Johanna: \\"It was so realistic, though. I felt like I was the heroine.\\"<br />Later, at the chalet, Matt ponders the ending of his potboiler-in-progress: \\"\\"Endings are funny things. I never plan them... more often than not, they come as a complete surprise...\\"<br />And finally, regarding the title of his latest book, Matt says: \\"I've given the title a lot of consideration.

Please not	In NO OFFENSE INTENDED, author Barbara Seranella continues the perils of her misfit heroine, \\"Munch\\" Mancini, a recovering drug addict and ex-hooker in 1977 Los Angeles. Munch still works as an ace mechanic at Happy Jack's Auto Repair, a job she initially landed in Seranella's first novel, NO HUMAN INVOLVED, also reviewed by me ( 5 stars) on this website.<br />Munch just can't seem to stay out of hot water. Or, rather, it seems to find her. One day, she is visited at work by a friend from her low-life days, one Sleaze John. That same afternoon, he's shot dead, apparently by a sniper, while driving along the freeway. This murder, and two others, propels Munch into new difficulties with the local law, represented by LAPD Homicide Detective Jigsaw Blackstone, and the FBI. It also gets Munch her first-ever plane ride into the \\"friendly skies\\". (From the fact alone that she seems to enjoy the experience, the reader knows it isn't 2001!)<br />In NO HUMAN INVOLVED, the LAPD's lead player, Detective Mace St. John, lived in a renovated 1927 Pullman car. In this thriller, Blackstone inhabits a renovated brewery. (I'm impressed, but don't any of LA's Finest reside in normal houses like us regular citizens?) This notable eccentricity aside, NO OFFENSE INTENDED doesn't measure up, in my opinion, to Seranella's first offering. Even though she remains a sympathetic character, Munch has lost some of the antisocial edginess that made her so endearing the first time around. Moreover, the latest storyline hasn't the same sort of humorous elements or ending plot twist that so impressed me in the previous. However, I do plan on reading Seranella's third novel in the Mancini series, UNWANTED COMPANY, and hope for the author's return to unqualified excellence, and Mancini's re-acquisition of a bad attitude.	2001-01-01

Curiosity inspired me to buy the book after visiting the park last October, during which time I thought I saw a wolf crossing a snow-covered clearing way off in the distance. It was definitely a large canine. Well, perhaps it was only Sergeant Preston's dog King on a mission for the RCMP.<br />To make a short story even shorter, WOLF WARS briefly summarizes the successful effort to eradicate the wolf from the western US at the turn of the last century, then reviews the recent, also successful, federal effort to re-establish wolves in that same region. The best chapters are the first, which describes the live capture of wolves in Alberta, Canada, and the last, which describes their subsequent release into YNP in 1995. In between, Fischer recounts ad nauseam the 20-year battle fought in the US Congress and the courts to design, popularize, legitimize and implement the plan to bring the animals back in the face of rabid opposition from the region's cattle and sheep ranchers. This relatively lengthy section focusing chiefly on government infighting was truly eye-glazing stuff, and best left to bureaucrats-in-training.<br />Yes, reading this book did teach me something - always a good thing in itself. But, a simple 10-page pamphlet would have sufficed.	2000-12-29

As an informal textbook on business management, or maybe marketing. As a social commentary on the rise of fast food, or possibly what defines America to the rest of the world. Or, as just a history of the hamburger from a culinary standpoint.<br />The author, David Hogan, effectively makes the case that White Castle and its founders, Billy Ingram and Walt Anderson (especially the former), were the originators of the fast food  \\"carryout\\" concept, and that they established the humble hamburger as the distinctive ethnic cuisine of the USA. The evolutionary history of White Castle from the early part of the 20th century to the present is described, from its founding in Wichita in 1921, through the Depression and two wars (W.W.II and Korea), to the era of the big chains (like McDonald's and Burger King), which, miraculously, have not brought about its demise. Along the way, Billy Ingram and his successors have successfully coped with an endless series of challenges, the first of which was to make the hamburger perceived as a sanitary and healthy food at all. Then came standardization of the product, national expansion, gaining credibility with and acceptance from the middle class, coping with war rationing, the hiring of women, surviving the rise of the superchains, adapting to suburbanization of the cities, defending against rising urban crime, facing increasing government regulations, and answering the health-conscious critics' attacks on the fast food lifestyle.<br />Today, White Castle survives as a barely medium-sized chain in the north-central and northeast regions of the United States. It has kept alive the guiding principles of its founders, has acquired a fanatical following, and remains profitable at a time when even larger chains, like Burger Chef and White Tower, have since disappeared from the American landscape.<br />SELLING `EM BY THE SACK is not a \\"thriller\\", offers no high drama, is written with no humor whatsoever, and is actually a little dry. Had it been about a brand of toothpaste or bread, I wouldn't have bothered. But, it's about hamburgers. (Oddly enough, cheeseburgers are never mentioned in any context.)

One night, while out on a binge, his wife and daughter are butchered in a manner so horrific that it defies description here. (This is, after all, a family website.) Leaving the force, Charlie's obsession is to track down the killer, since identified as The Traveling Man.<br />This crime novel is actually a two-for-one deal. A large part of the book's first half is devoted to Parker's investigation of a missing person incident, taken on at the request of an old pal on the NYPD. It bears no relation to his search for his family's executioner, but mainly serves to acquaint the reader with the larger concept of \\"serial killer\\", and introduce several players that remain in the plot to the novel's end, including Bird's disheveled FBI pal, Woolrich. (I didn't know \\"disheveled\\" was in the FBI dress code. Where's J. Edgar when you need him?)<br />This is a hard-boiled, gritty book - a triumph of a first novel by author John Connolly. He introduces us to villains that are truly nasty in the scariest sense, and who make Vlad the Impaler and Josef Mengele look like a kindly grandfathers in comparison. In any case, the identity of The Traveling Man is not resolved until twenty pages from the end, and involves an eye-popping plot twist that will have you looking forward to Connolly's next offering. However, if his subsequent thrillers continue to cast such monsters, I don't know if my imagination can take it. I'm getting to be a sissy in my old age.	2000-12-24

The bridegroom's father was old and he wished to see grandchildren of his race and lineage. That was why tonight Alis of Puiseaux would have to go to bed with a boy.\\"<br /><br />Thus begins THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, when 14 year-old Alis marries Ansiau of Linnieres, himself only 16. Ansiau is the son and heir of a minor baron whose fiefdom is centered on a dreary, inconsequential castle in the countryside southwest of Troyes in central France. Once the Old Man dies, Ansiau becomes Lord of the Castle, and Alis his Lady.<br /><br />This historical novel is about the relationship between Ansiau and Alis from the day of their marriage in the Year of Our Lord 1171, to well into the first quarter of the 13th century. The book's strengths and weaknesses derive from the details about their lives, and their kinships within an extended family, as they grow old together. It's an epic of multiple pregnancies, miscarriages, births, diseases, wounds, deaths, infidelities, debts, superstitions, treacheries, feuds, battles, flea-ridden castles, mud, cold, mold, damp, dust, heat, flies, mosquitoes, and other assorted attractions of the good ol' days.<br /><br />The two defining incidents of their marriage are arguably the Crusades that Ansiau embarks upon in 1179 and 1190. During his first absence from home, the storyline focuses on Alis as she learns to be a strong, self-reliant mistress of her domain. During his second adventure, we follow Ansiau and his adult sons to the Holy Land as they fight Saladin alongside England's Richard the Lionheart. Upon the baron's return to Linnieres, the couple is followed through ever increasing marital difficulties to final old age and infirmity, but still loyally together as the book's last lines indicate. (There's a lot to be said for togetherness in old age.)<br /><br />\\"She (Alis) shook her head and rested her cheek on the baron's shoulder. A huge red sun set behind the forest.\\"<br /><br />The author, Zo&eacute; Oldenbourg, took a great liberty with the dating of the Crusades in which Ansiau participated  - a liberty that seemed unnecessarily cavalier. The Third Crusade certainly took place around 1190, but none whatsoever occurred in 1179. Rather, Oldenbourg seems to have altered the date of the Second Crusade (?) of around 1148 to fit the plot. For some reason, that really annoyed me.<br /><br />Despite my pique over the dating, I rate this as a creditable, maybe exceptional, piece of historical fiction.

The Third Crusade certainly took place around 1190, but none whatsoever occurred in 1179. Rather, Oldenbourg seems to have altered the date of the Second Crusade (?) of around 1148 to fit the plot. For some reason, that really annoyed me.<br /><br />Despite my pique over the dating, I rate this as a creditable, maybe exceptional, piece of historical fiction.

That's how I got my copy ... from an ex-boss. (Hmmm... at least I think it was a gag gift.)<br />The book's hypothesis, made with one-liners and short observations, is that you and your life are essentially worthless and meaningless from the points of view of your friends, co-workers, boss, lovers, children, pets, and God. I guess one would have to be careful to whom to give this volume as a present. If the recipient was already suicidal, or maybe just enduring a 50th birthday, it might be enough to push him or her over the edge ... literally.<br />Some of the passages are particularly warm and fuzzy:<br />\\"Killing yourself would be a good idea. The only problem is that you don't have the guts\\"<br />\\"The bus driver would just as soon slit your throat as give you a ride.\\"<br />\\"Next time you have sex, fixate on just how horribly unattractive your body is.\\"<br />\\"You hate your job. And it's safe to say that no one at your job is particularly fond of you either.\\"<br />\\"When you pray, no one is listening. Furthermore, you look ridiculous.\\"<br />And my personal favorite, because I have a pet cat, Trouble, that I regard as my good buddy:<br />\\"That special bond you think you have with your pet is imaginary. As long as it has food and water, you could get hit by a train tomorrow, and your pet wouldn't think anything of it.\\"<br />I'm enormously lucky in that I have a healthy level of self-esteem. Otherwise, I think I might close this book and go looking for a garden hose to attach to my car's exhaust pipe.	2000-12-20

In the former, Dand MacNeill continues to reminisce about his time spent as a subaltern commanding a platoon of tartan-kilted Scottish Highlanders during the period 1945-1947 while the battalion is posted to both Libya and Edinburgh. One of MacNeill's Jocks is Pvt. John McAuslan, by consensus the filthiest, most unkempt soldier in the British Army. As Dand records:<br />\\"... (his) grey-white shirt was open to the waist, revealing what was either his skin or an old vest, you couldn't tell which. His hair was tangled and his mouth hung open; altogether he looked as though he'd just completed a bell-ringing stint at Notre Dame.\\"<br />Each of Fraser's books is a collection of short stories relating to events experienced by Dand and his battalion, and particularly his platoon, and which are based on Fraser's own service in the Gordon Highlanders during the same time period. So, in this volume, the lieutenant and his comrades-in-arms garrison an isolated desert outpost for a month, face the controversial inclusion of a black piper in the regimental band (it is, after all, 1946), compete in a general knowledge quiz contest with the Fusiliers regiment, contemplate McAuslan's dubious success with the ladies, mount a nighttime raid on the local Souk to apprehend two deserters, and engage the Royals regiment in a golf tournament. And, lastly, what happens when Dand and McAuslan are released from active duty (\\"demobbed\\") on the same day. Whereas in GENERAL McAuslan's contribution to events was erratic and usually of brief duration, in ROUGH his role is expanded to the point where he's a key player in four of the seven chapters.  As always, MacNeill's first person narration, both witty and good-natured, ties it all together.<br />Note: MCAUSLAN IN THE ROUGH is currently out of print in the US. However, it and Fraser's two other books in the McAuslan series, THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN and THE SHEIKH AND THE DUSTBIN, are all contained in THE COMPLETE MCAUSLAN. I found this to be a captivating and entertaining volume, which I heartily recommend to anyone who is a student of the British military's former role in establishing and policing the Empire.

Commissioned as a subaltern (2nd lieutenant) following the Japanese surrender, he served as a platoon leader in a Gordon Highlander battalion posted to the Middle East before being \\"demobbed\\", i.e. released from active duty. His experiences serve as the basis for THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN, initially published in 1970, a first person account by the fictional Dand MacNeill, subaltern of a platoon in an unspecified Highland battalion posted first to Libya, then to Edinburgh, during the period 1945-1947.<br />THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN is a work of wry humor, inasmuch as Lt. MacNeill describes the unintentionally comic situations encountered with his Jocks (men) during garrison life both in Scotland and abroad, mostly the latter. The book is actually a series of short stories, in which a common thread tying all together, besides Dand himself, is Pvt. McAuslan, the dirtiest, most slovenly soldier in His Majesty's service. As described by MacNeill:<br />\\" ... he lurched into my office (even in his best tunic and tartan he looked like a fugitive from Culloden who had been hiding in a peat bog) ...\\"<br />McAuslan may be the focus of a particular chapter, as when he is court-martialed for refusing an order to enter a pillow fight contest to be held during a gathering of the various Highland regiments. Or, he may  make nothing more than a brief cameo appearance, as when he is upbraided by MacNeill for fighting one of the crewman aboard the coastal steamer ferrying the battalion's soccer team on a road-trip against the teams of neighboring British commands - a fight brought on by the sailor's comments regarding McAuslan's unsanitary appearance.<br />The squalid presence of McAuslan notwithstanding, the central character of the book is Dand MacNeill, whether he's coping with the unfathomable questions of the officer selection board, pressed into command of an overnight troop train from Cairo to Jerusalem through unruly Palestine, mounting the ceremonial guard at Edinburgh Castle, or taking lessons in regimental piping history from the god-like Regimental Sergeant Major. Dand's narrative of military service is of such good humor and wit that it's evident his alter ego, Fraser, remembers his own time in uniform as an enriching life experience, despite the hardships of WWII combat. This positive slant on the book's theme, and Fraser's/MacNeill's fine sense of the ludicrous, make the volume one that I couldn't put down. (I've encountered so-called \\"thrillers\\" that were less absorbing.)<br />Note: THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN is currently out of print in the US. However, it and Fraser's two sequels in the McAuslan series, MCAUSLAN IN THE ROUGH and THE SHEIKH AND THE DUSTBIN, are all contained in THE COMPLETE MCAUSLAN, available from Amazon.co.uk.

Nonetheless, every great warlord, if he survives long enough, has his twilight, and MACARTHUR'S WAR documents his - that period from June 1950 until April 1952 when his career and reputation became mired in the Korean War, the first of America's post-W.W.II Asian debacles.<br />Author Stanley Weintraub's volume is a well researched, albeit dry, history of the general's last campaign. Within its pages, we encounter a wealth of players, both major and minor. MacArthur himself, America's aging postwar proconsul of a defeated Japan, sometimes brilliant, too often insubordinate, but always egotistical, self-aggrandizing, and militantly anticommunist. The staff toadies who surrounded him and sustained his narrow view of the universe, at the center of which was always Douglas himself: generals Wright, Willoughby and Whitney. His combat commanders: the hapless Gen. Walker (8th Army) and the self-important flunky Gen. Almond (X Corps). The wretched South Korean dictator, Syngman Rhee. General Peng Dehuai, the capable Chinese commander who infiltrated 200,000 of his troops into North Korea right under MacArthur's very nose. The plucky female war correspondent, Marguerite Higgins, who defied the clubbish, men-only mindset of her peers to go out and bring back the story. The home-front military and ex-military, in particular JCS Chairman Bradley and Defense Secretary Marshall, both so in awe of Douglas as to be rendered virtually ineffectual. Truman, the politically beleaguered Commander-In-Chief, who finally brought MacArthur to heel in a fit of righteous pique. And finally, MacArthur's eventual replacement as Supreme Commander, the humorlessly efficient Gen. Ridgeway.<br />If your previous exposure to the Korean \\"police action\\" has been nothing more than \\"MASH\\" reruns, then you'll find this book to be a valuable introduction. It includes a center section of about 30 photos. Woefully, it includes only one map - a single page rendering of the entire Korean peninsula, which, more often than otherwise, doesn't even show the places where the action takes place. (The map is so extraordinarily useless, I wonder why the author bothered at all.)<br />In the end, MacArthur was a victim of his own Weltanschauung, which became increasingly outmoded and dysfunctional as the Cold War swiftly monopolized the world stage. Had it not been for Korea, MacArthur's place on Mt. Olympus would certainly been assured. Instead, he died in relative obscurity in 1964 in the Waldorf-Astoria.ludes only one map - a single page rendering of the entire Korean peninsula, which, more often than otherwise, doesn't even show the places where the action takes place.

Within its pages, it's 1972, and the United States is still convalescing from a military invasion of Cuba ten years earlier that had resulted in several of America's cities being nuked to oblivion by Soviet warheads, including Washington, DC, and the First Family of Camelot. In retaliation, SAC had bombed the USSR back into the nuclear Dark Ages,  an act for which the US is regarded almost as a pariah state. It's only apparent friend is Great Britain, which continues to send food and aid to America's struggling populace, otherwise governed by a weak civilian administration dominated by the military and a shadowy, retired Air Force general. The protagonist of this fairy tale is Carl Landry, an ex-Army sergeant now working as a reporter for Boston's major newspaper. While covering the murder of an aged vet of the Kennedy era, Landry stumbles onto the trail of yet another guv'mint conspiracy, this one with a decidedly British accent.<br />This potboiler hardly simmers through its first half. It's only when Carl and his English gal pal, Sandy, a reporter for the London Times, are chased through the ostensibly uninhabited city of New York by military thugs that the plot heats up beyond lukewarm. As a matter of fact, the love affair between Carl and Sandy suffers from the same lack of heat. I've seen more passion between two snails. To be fair, some amount of frigid water is thrown on Carl's ardor as he begins to suspect that Sandy is not quite what she purports to be. (A secret agent for the Queen Mum, perhaps. Her mission, to find good Indian take-out.)<br />The biggest problem with this \\"thriller\\" is that  the Landry character is painted in such wishy-washy tints. The reader has no idea even what he looks like, much less develop any sympathy for his predicament or root him on to final triumph. He doesn't have an obnoxious drinking buddy, favorite parakeet, nasty chewing tobacco habit, or weakness for cold spaghetti - anything that would flesh out his persona. In any case, as the true nature of the conspiracy is revealed and our marginal hero saves the day, it was hard not to stifle a yawn, or two. Perhaps my drowsiness was a function of the intrigue's level of evil - it wasn't as horrific as usual in most fiction, but just real-life banal. (I mean, the Florida Ballot Chad Machination was more Machiavellian than this.)<br />I grant this novel three stars, not because it's that good, but because the author was well-intentioned and gave a good effort. Towards the end, however, I hastened to finish the book only because I wanted to get on to the next one on my shelf, which I trust will be much better.an obnoxious drinking buddy, favorite parakeet, nasty chewing tobacco habit, or weakness for cold spaghetti - anything that would flesh out his persona.

A black man is framed by a racist populace for the murder of an ostensibly popular white man. And, of course, a novice lawyer, with zero experience in capital murder cases, is assigned as defense counsel for the trial. Ho-hum. The premise is so threadbare that I normally wouldn't have read beyond the jacket. But, hang on a minute ...<br />In this multi-faceted thriller by John Katzenbach, the place is Stalag Luft 13, a Luftwaffe prison camp for allied flyers shot down in WWII. The accused, Lincoln Scott, is a fictional black pilot of the real-life, famed 332nd  Fighter Group (the Tuskegee Airmen), who was downed while heroically defending a crippled B-17 bomber. He's the only Negro prisoner in the camp, and a aloof loner by choice because, you understand, he distrusts whites. The victim, Trader Vic, is a respected bomber pilot from Mississippi that had become the stalag's expert trader in forbidden goods. Lt. Tommy Hart, the navigator of a downed B-25, stands for the defense. Tommy, who left law school to join the Army Air Corps, has essentially finished his law studies while as a POW by reading every legal text he can lay his hands on. The Senior American Officer, Col. MacNamara, and the camp commandant, Luftwaffe Oberst Von Reiter, only want to get Scott's court-martial wrapped up quickly without undue embarrassment to either the Americans or the Germans.<br />This novel unfolds on many levels. It is, of course, a courtroom drama. But it's also a war drama, a detective drama, a prison drama, and an escape drama. Young Hart is clearly the reluctant, white-hatted good guy, but the moral and ethical issues revealed as he squares off against the rest of the camp remain elusively gray. Who, for instance, is the most evil, black-hatted bad guy? Even the battle-maimed and bitter camp adjutant, Hauptmann Visser, is a man possessing a certain honor, and doing his duty as he perceives it. And, when the identity and motive of the real killer are uncovered, would you, the reader, condemn and convict? This is a question that Tommy himself must ultimately answer as his personality is hammered to maturity in the forge of \\"growing up\\".<br />I liked this book very much, finishing it over a 4-day business trip to DC. I especially liked the irony presented by the 84 hats, an \\"in-your-face\\" consequence thrust into Tommy's consciousness, the unforeseen result of a decision he, essentially a non-violent person, had to make to survive.dentity and motive of the real killer are uncovered, would you, the reader, condemn and convict?

As we were leaving the grounds of the monument, we noticed the Big Indian Tepee Trading Post (or something to that effect) across the road (\\"Gifts, Souvenirs, T-Shirts, Cold Drinks, Food, Whatever\\"). I didn't feel like getting scalped in a tourist ambush, but my wife wanted to check it out. So, of course, we stopped. And, I'm glad we did, because I came across this absolutely marvelous book.<br />Owen Tully Stratton was a medicine show pitchman from 1898 to 1904, and a licensed, small town MD from 1906 to 1950. MEDICINE MAN is his memoir, as edited by his son. In the book's first 100 pages, Owen recounts his crisscrossing of Washington, Oregon, Nevada, California, Montana and Idaho as a medicine show huckster. While today one might view such an entrepreneur as not much better than a used car salesman at best, or scam artist at worst, I learned one very surprising fact. Owen's medicine show, and the others he talks about, regularly employed an MD licensed in the state they were traveling through. In any town the show happened to be working, the physician would set up a temporary office to see patients referred to him by the pitchman. The show's MD was not necessarily any more of a quack than the local medicos, so he was actually in a position to provide legitimate medical care - and often did. Of course the medicine show and its tame MD were bitterly resented by the local sawbones and pill pushers.<br />The remainder of the volume is Owen's recollection of his life as a degreed and licensed MD, practicing at various times in Washington, Idaho and Montana. It was a hard existence, both on himself and his family. But Dr. Stratton reminisces with a perceptive wit that calls to mind the writings of the great Mark Twain. At one point, the author, a self-confident general practitioner (GP) but reluctant surgeon, recounts the time he assisted on an appendectomy with a more experienced, but inebriated, cutter:<br />\\"My surgeon, in his drunken enthusiasm, discarded contaminated instruments by throwing them against the wall. The patient knew nothing of that, and her convalescence was uneventful. With that experience, my surgical feet warmed up a trifle.\\"<br />Evident to the reader are the striking differences between the practice of medicine then and now, with some not necessarily for the better. Take, for example, \\"house calls\\". For those of you too young to be acquainted with the concept, a house call was a visit by a physician to a patient's home to render care. This was simply the way medicine was practiced in those days, and up until the time of the mid 20th century. (As a young boy in the early 50's, I remember accompanying my father, also a GP, on his house call rounds.)<br />I cannot recommend this book to highly. I was particularly impressed by the circumstances surrounding the good doctor's own death, as related by his son in an Editor's Epilog. His departure from life was pure class.<br />My own father is deceased these past 25 years, but I shall give this volume to my mother, also an MD. Her maternal grandfather was a physician in rural Missouri at the end of the 19th century, and I'm sure she'll find it as fascinating as I did.h a more experienced, but inebriated, cutter: <br />\\"My surgeon, in his drunken enthusiasm, discarded contaminated instruments by throwing them against the wall.

His ex-girlfriend is Amanda<br />Mays, deputy metro editor at a major Washington, DC rag. His brand new<br />girlfriend of one night is Toni, an aspiring actress who lives<br />upstairs. Carl is hired by Maggie Peterson, the rapacious editor of a<br />New York publishing house, to ghostwrite a novel based on memoirs<br />obtained from a high-level Washington source named GIDEON. By<br />necessity, Gideon's identity must remain secret. Carl must crank<br />the book out in three weeks, writing from notes made from examining<br />original material brought in daily by a gun-toting heavy, then taken<br />away. Carl soon realizes that his book will be the vehicle to expose a<br />horrific incident in someone's past. However, within a week of<br />starting, Carl's apartment is ransacked, and his fledgling creation<br />stolen....With clues remembered by Carl from the original source<br />material, both flee to Mississippi, pursued by an efficient assassin<br />named The Closer, to seek an answer to the Gideon riddle. Implicated<br />in the conspiracy is the President of the United States. (Well, hey,<br />what modern day Chief Executive isn't at the heart of one sort of<br />conspiracy or another?)  And above everything, seemingly pulling all<br />the strings, is a power hungry, international media mogul. (Sure, why<br />not. Let's give Bill Gates the day off on this one.)

But, for most of her life, she's also earned the bulk of her income from being a waitress. In WAITING: THE TRUE CONFESSIONS OF A WAITRESS, she describes what it's been like serving demanding, hungry humans, and possibly you or me, since her first job at 16 in her father's luncheonette.<br />Debra's table-waiting odyssey takes her from upstate New York to Yellowstone to Portland, Oregon to Southern California. In various chapters, she educates the reader on the theory and practice of tipping, the waitress's definition of \\"personal service\\", the hierarchy of restaurant employees, the relation between food and sex, the screen image of the waitress as portrayed since 1970, the highs and lows of the various dine-out holidays (Mother's Day, Valentine's Day, Christmas Eve, New Years Eve, etc.), the uniqueness of the cocktail waitress, the reality of choosing wines, the perils of the \\"split shift\\", and the art of triaging multiple food orders from several tables. And, because she was, and is, a single mother, the image of the pregnant waitress as perceived by customers and restaurant management.<br />WAITING could be considered a companion piece to KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL (also reviewed by me on this website), an \\"expos&eacute;\\" of the restaurant business as seen from the perspective of a professional chef. However, there is one big difference between Ginsberg and the author of the other, Anthony Bourdain. I like the personality of the former, while that of the latter I found truly obnoxious and annoying. My only disappointment with Ginsberg's style was its relative lack of humor compared to what it might have been.

Jack, once a hard-boiled Major in the U.S. Army's Military Police, has been (in all three novels) drifting from here to there to no place in particular, and getting enmeshed in unusual situations that force him to fight assorted scum. His modus operandi makes him a worthy drinking buddy and soulmate of the Clint Eastwood 1970's screen character, Dirty Harry.<br />In TRIPWIRE, Jack inherits from Gen. Leon Garber (ret.), his former Army commanding officer recently deceased, the task of tracking down for an aged and ailing couple the fate of their pilot son, Victor Hobie, still MIA many years after the Vietnam war in which he flew helicopters. Perceived by the reader, but unbeknownst to Jack, Hobie is now a sadistic, extremely vicious, burn-scarred amputee now operating in the Big Apple as a high end loan shark to financially desperate CEOs. (Or is he?) His specialty is torturing and killing the family members of his debtors should they default. One sweet teddy bear.<br />Having read the previous two Reacher yarns some time ago, my memory may be suspect. However, I recall the action in those two being more constant and sustained. In TRIPWIRE, the plot develops with more serenity (such as it is), with the tension for the reader being the knowledge that Jack and Hobie will eventually face off against one another - the classic confrontation between the Guy Wearing the White Hat vs. the Guy Wearing the Black Hat. The only thing lacking is the famous Eastwood squint.<br />Being sufficiently Neanderthal to have loved all of the Dirty Harry films, it's no surprise that Reacher has swaggered into my pantheon of fictional heroes. Child's fourth thriller in the series, RUNNING BLIND, is definitely on my Wish List. However, I remain puzzled and just a little disappointed that Jack, at 38 and supremely self sufficient, remains without a clue when it comes for him to do his ... laundry. I'll bet even Dirty Harry knew how to press and fold a shirt - those were the days when my heroes were made of iron.comes for him to do his ... laundry.

At worst, pure drivel	CIVIL WAR FANTASTIC is a medley of 18 short tales of the supernatural or alternative history, told by various authors in the context of the War Between the States. However, the book might just as well be a collection of (rejected) scripts for the old TV series \\"Twilight Zone\\" and/or \\"Outer Limits\\".<br />A small minority of the stories are marginally inventive, or at least barely entertaining. In the \\"be careful what you wish for\\" category, a Confederate soldier of the 15th Alabama meets his aged future self immediately prior to the assault on Little Round Top at Gettysburg, and, at the persuasion of the latter, fires a shot that alters history. In a bit of blarney, a Southerner of Irish heritage in the Vicksburg trenches calls upon the leprechauns of the Old Country to help win the battle.  And, during Lee's last retreat to Petersburg, a wounded Rebel soldier is aided by his descendent fighting in the Vietnam debacle.<br />While I admit that all of the fables are at least a little silly, most, unfortunately, are pure drivel and/or totally pointless. \\"Martial\\" is probably the worst: the first person account of a hapless nag mired in Gettysburg's present-day tourist attraction, who encounters the proud spirit of a Union cavalry remount. Then, there's the small boy saved by General Lee before the Gettysburg battle, when the latter will not accept a demon's help as it would require the ritual blood sacrifice of the former. Even President Lincoln becomes part of a farce as, unable to come up with words suitable for the Gettysburg Address, he is inspired by the ghosts of two of that field's combatants. Oh, and let's not forget the totally ludicrous \\"The Three Cigars\\", wherein the American Civil War is nothing more than a staged entertainment event, produced and directed by the future's First Rumanian Science Fiction Commando for the benefit of its national TV audience. (Huh?!)<br />If you're a serious student of the Blue-Gray conflict, don't bother with this piece of trash - not even if you're overrun by an attack of whimsy.

At the very start, we have the Apollo 17 astronauts discovering  the isotope helium-3 in a moon crater in 1972. Fast forward to the present. Helium-3 is a necessary component of a hydrogen fusion process that will produce unlimited amounts of squeaky-clean energy. Of course, the only local source is the moon, long since forsaken by the US space program. Bummer! Ex-NASA wonder boy Jack Medaris, now head of his own space engineering firm, Medaris Engineering Company (MEC), is hired by entrepreneurs to retrieve some of the isotope from the lunar surface before a world treaty is signed that would ban any nuclear energy-producing process, including hydrogen fusion. When Jack's robot lunar miner is destroyed by the inevitable evil conspiracy - probably the same one now boosting premium gas to $2+ a gallon, his solution is to commandeer the shuttle Columbia on the day of its launch, and take it BACK TO THE MOON to retrieve the precious helium-3 \\"dirt\\". He does all this with the help of his engineering wizards at MEC, and a smart lawyer that writes a slick contract, signed by MEC, NASA and the Department of Transportation (DOT), that ultimately makes the hijack legal. This last wrinkle really puts a twist in the knickers of the female US Attorney General, a figure obviously reminiscent of Janet Reno.<br />The predictable plot is nothing more than a series of ludicrously preposterous and impossible action sequences. However, the ingenuity of Hickam's space scenes, and the characters of Jack and Penny High Eagle, make the novel palatable. Penny is a spoiled, self-absorbed Ph.D. biologist, who, like the now-deceased Carl Sagan, has become more of a media personality than scientist. It doesn't hurt her image that she's also a Cherokee Indian, and the first Native American to visit the South Pole, climb Mt. Everest, and dive to the Titanic hulk. Originally added to the Columbia's original (all-female) crew as a payload specialist, she's the only one to get aboard the shuttle before Jack and his sidekick Virgil abscond with it. The initial personal interaction between Jack and the bratty High Eagle gives new meaning to the term \\"bicker\\". But, it just so happens that Jack was previously tragically widowed, and Penny is very much a \\"babe\\", so you can see where that set of circumstances is going.<br />Like I said, I give this work a reluctant \\"thumbs up\\". However, there was one question left dangling. One of Penny's original, space experiments was to test the effects of weightlessness on the feline sense of balance. Thus, Paco the cat gets seized along with High Eagle, and spends his time happily clawing his way around the Columbia's cabin. Now, how does one get a cat to use a litter box in zero-g?ole, climb Mt.

At the beginning of the book, she is taken care of by her mother and sole parent, Rosie. (It isn't until the end of the memoir that the reader has anything approaching a clear idea of what happened to her father, Larry. Even then, it stays fuzzy because Laura never finds out herself.) Soon, however, Rosie dies, apparently of cancer. Young Laura (\\"Lily\\") then comes under the care of her mother's eccentric brothers, 38 year old Gabe and 40 year old Len - two \\"O.B.s\\", i.e. \\"old bachelors\\".  A bit later, the group is enlarged when Lily's senile maternal grandmother, Etka, moves in.<br />Since I did my growing up as a little boy, it was enlightening to see a glimpse of how it was endured by the other half. It was also quite amazing to read what details Lily remembers of her earliest school experiences. I can barely remember at 5 going to the Hill &amp; Dale Nursery School in Pacific Palisades, California, and that we were expected to take afternoon naps - perhaps for the mental relief of our minders, not ourselves. In any case, Laura relates the events of her childhood with humor and pathos. When her grandmother moves in, she expects the old lady to conform with her experience of her friends' grandmothers, i.e. to be a cookie maker. Yet, when left alone with her for the first time:<br />\\"I look at her, expecting her to toss off her tailored jacket, tuck up her cuffs, and roll out the cookie dough. Instead, she purses her lips in an expression she learned as a child, and tilts her head in a practiced way: `Now, perhaps, you could fix me a little lunch?'. It isn't supposed to be this way, I think as I take her order: `toasted cheese sandwich and a sliced orange'\\".<br />Later, when on a child's guilt trip reliving the sins of her young life, Lily remembers:<br />\\"And last and worst, on the final night of my mother's life, when Gabe held the phone to my ear and said, `Say goodbye to your mother', I had made a joke of it, and said, `Goodbye', only it was ... forever.\\"<br />Today, when the repercussions of a broken home loom large in society's consciousness due to the well publicized meltdowns of a sick few, SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS serves as a gentle reminder that home, for a child, is where the love is - whether it comes from a father, mother, uncles, aunts, or grandparents.<br />I liked this book a lot, and I think you will too.of my mother's life, when Gabe held the phone to my ear and said, `Say goodbye to your mother', I had made a joke of it, and said, `Goodbye', only it was ... forever.\\"<br />Today, when the repercussions of a broken home loom large in society's consciousness due to the well publicized meltdowns of a sick few, SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS serves as a gentle reminder that home, for a child, is where the love is - whether it comes from a father, mother, uncles, aunts, or grandparents.<br />I liked this book a lot, and I think you will too.	2000-10-05

(His other book, RUSSKA, was apparently an aberrational dalliance.) In all of his novels, Rutherford goes back in time and selects fictional families living in a specific geographical area, then visits members of each family at key points down through history as they interact with each other and the environment of the chosen area. In SARUM, it was the land surrounding the English town of Salisbury, including Stonehenge. In LONDON, it was ... well, London. In THE FOREST, it's the New Forest in the English county of Hampshire, a triangular patch of land approximately anchored by Salisbury, Christchurch and Southampton, and on the mainland immediately northwest of the Isle of Wight. \\"Forest\\", a French term, originally meant \\"reservation\\", and the New Forest was such a place set aside by Duke William of Normandy as a royal hunting preserve after becoming William I, King of England, in 1066 by defeating King Harold at Hastings.<br />Rutherford begins his narrative in 1099, and continues in chapters headed 1294, 1480, 1587, 1635, 1794, 1868 and 2000 respectively. From previous exposure to the author's style, I've found it convenient to consider each chapter a short story more or less independent from the overall chronology. That way, I don't get too confused by the intersecting genealogical lines of the featured families as they thread through the centuries.<br />This is a collection of vignettes portraying the human dramas encountered in the everyday lives of ordinary people, both gentry and commoners, as influenced by the time and place of their life spans. Thus, one becomes acquainted with Adela, a Norman noblewoman in search of a husband soon after the Conquest, and Brother Adam, an abbey monk suffering a crisis of faith after being seduced by a local housewife. Then there's Jonathan, a young boy living in the port of Lymington, caught in a storm at sea during a boat race, and Clement, a young gentleman threatened by his crazy mother's treasonous behavior as the Spanish Armada seemed poised to invade. And Alice, caught in the turbulent and dangerous times of Cromwell's Civil War and the subsequent Restoration. Or Fanny, an heiress pulled in opposite directions by love and an age-old family vendetta, on trial for shoplifting a piece of lace. Finally, Colonel Albion, fighting to save the forest he loves from the depredations of the London politicians.<br />If you're looking for a thriller, or epic conflicts between a series of protagonists and antagonists, then THE FOREST is not for you. However, if you love England - especially that - and you enjoy vicariously immersing yourself in the everyday joys, heartaches, triumphs and defeats of others, then you'll love this book. Moreover, THE FOREST contains interesting information about non-human elements of the region: the mating rituals of the local deer population, the life cycles of the forest's oak trees, the method for harvesting salt from seawater, the formation of bogs, the proper use of timber in the art of building wooden sailing ships. Additionally, England's southern coast was once a hotbed of smuggling (oh, sorry ... \\"free trade\\"), and Rutherford gives some insight into its economics and methods as practiced there.<br />If, by serendipity or design, you should find yourself on the A31 between Southampton and Ringwood, perhaps leave the main route onto the B3078 or A337, and explore the villages and landscape of the New Forest. I've been on the A31 several times, yet have never taken the time to explore this small corner of England.

In it, we have \\"Munch\\" Mancini, a street wise, world weary, over-the-top-cynical ex-prostitute and recovering heroin addict, hiding from both a brutal biker and Mace St. John, the latter a street wise and world weary cop investigating a series of murders in the Los Angeles of the 70's. Munch is a prime suspect in one of the slayings. She's also a crackerjack auto mechanic, a skill she utilizes to bring in a paycheck while she lies low. As for Mace, he lives in a lovingly restored, 1927-vintage Pullman car parked on a spur of unused Southern Pacific track in an unprepossessing part of town.<br />In so many works of this genre, the author attempts to create sympathetic characters, apparently using some arcane formula that only results in very two-dimensional personae. I can't tell you how many crime thrillers I've finished not caring one iota about the story's hero(es). Somehow, in her first time out, Saranella manages to transcend this trap, creating in Munch and Mace people I cared about from the very first page. This is so refreshing!<br />The plot of NO HUMAN INVOLVED is revealed to the reader in a manner as smooth and sharp as a scalpel's incision lays open the inside of a cadaver during an autopsy. There's even a bit of humor and pathos along the way in Mace's relationship with a new girlfriend, and with his aging father, the latter suffering a mental deterioration following several strokes. The manner in which Mace acquires two dogs near the book's conclusion is particularly amusing. The story's end involves a satisfying plot twist.<br />Judging from subsequent releases by the same author, Munch is to be the central character in a continuing series. Bravo! I, for one, immediately added Saranella's two latest books to my Wish List.	2000-09-22

Occasional attention is paid to the equally  great battles in the West - Shiloh, Vicksburg, Chattanooga. It's therefore  both refreshing and unusual, in GLORIETA PASS, for a writer to focus on  that forgotten backwater of the conflict, the Southwest - specifically New  Mexico in this historical novel.<br />There are five main characters (and a  regiment's worth of minor ones I won't mention). Jamie Russell is one of  three sons of a Texas family who join the Southern Cause. Jamie marches  west, his two brothers east (and out of the plot.) Lacey McIntyre is a  lieutenant in the regular US Army stationed in the New Mexico Territory at  the outbreak of the rebellion. Lacey's family is from Tennessee, so his  loyalty to the Union is tenuous at best. Alastar \\"Red\\" O'Brien is an  illiterate Irishman working the Colorado mines near Denver. He organizes a  group of his fellows into a unit of the Colorado Volunteers, and is awarded  a captaincy by the state's governor. Also in Red's unit is Charles  Franklin, an Eastern dandy that becomes one of Red's lieutenants. Finally,  there is Laura Howland, a young woman recently orphaned, who is invited to  New Mexico by her dead father's brother. Suffice it to say that all players  come together at GLORIETA PASS, the book's climactic Blue vs. Gray  encounter.<br />The military action proceeds at a relatively sedate pace. But,  since the facts of it were passably researched by the author for background  material, and I knew relatively little about this theater of the war, the  novel held my interest in that respect. With the exception of Jamie, the  female author characterizes the principal male players as usually drunk,  loutish, treacherous, or otherwise in the grip of base passions. (Men are  such brutes!) It's virtuous Laura, the story line's Female in Distress,  around whom much of the action coalesces, especially as she attracts the  attention of just about all the love-starved male leads at one point or  another. Most intriguing is the Charles Franklin character, a very unusual  trooper. And, it's a measure of the reader's perception as to how soon  he/she can answer the question \\"What's going on with this guy?\\"<br />The book  doesn't measure up to THE KILLER ANGELS, or even the prequel and sequel to  that classic, GODS AND GENERALS and THE LAST FULL MEASURE, respectively.  However, it's still fairly good, especially if you're a Civil War buff. I  also suggest that it will appeal to women as much as men, if not more.om much of the action coalesces, especially as she attracts the  attention of just about all the love-starved male leads at one point or  another.

A  consummate pro. ON THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN, originally published in  1984, is his chronicle of a resolute journey around the circumference of  the Mediterranean, an arduous tour of ancient cities, ruins and near ruins  that would have surely daunted a lesser man.  Beginning at his home in  Tuscany, he shepherds the reader along to Naples, Venice, Montenegro,  Albania, Mt. Olympus (in Greece), Istanbul, Turkey's Mediterranean shore  (the Troad), Jerusalem, the Pyramids, Tobruk (in Libya), Tunisia, Fez (in  Morocco), Gibraltar, Seville (in Spain), and Nice (on the Côte d' Azur).  After 484 pages (in paperback) of relatively small print, I collapsed  exhausted.<br />Newby has an exceptional eye for detail and history, which  can provide either joy or torment to the armchair traveler. SHORES  accomplishes both. He's at his very best when describing the Harem at  Topkapi (in Istanbul), the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (in Jerusalem), the  nightmare (and somewhat comic) bus ride from Tripoli to Tunis, and the  Moroccan city of Fez. His very worst had to be the chapter dedicated to  Holy Week in Seville, a migraine-inducing and seemingly endless enumeration  of processions, floats, statues and religious brotherhoods involved in the  Roman Catholic celebration of this yearly festivity. Enough already, for  cryin' out loud! (And I was born and raised Catholic, even!) The fact that  Eric has an unfortunate penchant for constructing looooooong sentences,  sometimes in excess of 100 words, doesn't help.<br />The biggest  disappointments of this otherwise laudable book were two. First, because of  conflict in the city, he didn't visit Beirut, Lebanon. Second, too  infrequent mention was made of his long-suffering travel companion and  wife, Wanda, who would occasionally contribute a pointed remark about the  latest fine mess that husband Eric had gotten them into. I liked Wanda a  lot.	2000-09-06

There are four principal  players. Father Angwin, pastor of the Roman Catholic church of St. Thomas  Aquinas, has lost his belief in God's existence, but determinedly continues  to serve his flock while suffering the oversight of his idiot diocesan  bishop. Miss Dempsey, his spinster housekeeper, lives in terror of a small  wart above her upper lip, thinking it a portent of cancer. Sister  Philomena, a nun teaching in the parish school, is an Irish girl forced by  her family into the convent, where she endures the petty tyranny of its  Mother Superior. Then there's FLUDD, a curate ostensibly sent by the  obnoxious bishop to help Angwin modernize his pastoral approach. Or is he?  Once Fludd is in residence, people begin to ... transform.<br />The engaging  aspect of this story is that the reader never understands the nature of the  being called Fludd, a mystery also grazing Angwin's perception during his  first meal with Fludd, when the former observed:<br />\\"Whenever (he) looked up  at (Fludd), it seemed that his whiskey glass was raised to his lips, but  the level of what was in it did not seem to go down; and yet from time to  time the young man reached out for the bottle, and topped himself up. It  had been the same with their late dinner, there were three sausages on  Father Fludd's plate, and he was always cutting into one or other, and  spearing a bit on his fork; he was always chewing in an unobtrusive, polite  way, with his mouth shut tight. And yet there were always three sausages on  his plate, until at last, quite suddenly, there were none.\\"<br />Is Fludd a  man, or something ... else. He can tell fortunes by looking at the palm of  one's hand. He alludes to having once been the practitioner of another  profession that sounds a lot like alchemy. Odd talents for a Catholic  priest.

THE CONQUERING FAMILY is the first book of four by Thomas Costain on the  Plantagenet kings of England. In my opinion, this set, and the 3-volume  masterpiece by Shelby Foote on the U.S. Civil War, are the best historical  series I've ever read. (The last three volumes in the Costain quartet are:  THE MAGNIFICENT CENTURY, THE THREE EDWARDS, and THE LAST  PLANTAGENETS.)<br />THE CONQUERING FAMILY chronicles the reigns of Henry II  (1154-1189), and his sons Richard I \\"the Lionhearted\\" (1189-1199) and John  (1199-1216). Henry II, in my opinion the greatest of English monarchs,  created an empire that included not only Britain, but perhaps as much as  two-thirds of present day France (thanks, in great part, to his marriage to  the dynamic Eleanor of Aquitaine, the Duchess of that province and the  former Queen of France.) By the end of John's reign, virtually all French  possessions were lost and England was racked by civil war. No chip off the  old block was John.<br />The general public usually associates Henry II with  his quarrel with, and eventual murder of, Archbishop Thomas Becket of  Canterbury. Richard I is, of course, \\"the Lionhearted\\" king who crusaded in  the Holy Land against the infidels, and who has a fictional association  with Robin Hood. And, lastly, there's the misfit King John, of Magna Carta  fame.<br />A perfect companion piece to this volume is the 1968 film THE LION  IN WINTER, starring Peter O'Toole as Henry and Katharine Hepburn as  Eleanor, the latter winning an Academy Award for her performance. The  film's story evolves over Christmas, 1183, in the royal castle of Chinon,  as Henry, Eleanor, and sons Richard, Geoffrey and John quarrel, backstab,  and plot amongst themselves as to which son will inherit the thrown on  Henry's death. It's my all-time favorite film for reasons given in my  review of it on this website. More to the point, the book and the film are  consistent in their portrayal of this royal family as dysfunctional with a  capital \\"D\\". It's a quote from Hepburn's Eleanor that heads this review,  and which says it all. (By comparison, the current English royal family is  merely a bunch of trivial sissies.) Both the book and the film are powerful  portrayals of a ruling dynasty, the likes of which the world will likely  never see again. If you're at all interested in English history, you  absolutely must not overlook either the Costain series or the movie.tal \\"D\\".

The pathologist who  performed the autopsy on the stiff is then found dead herself, her throat  cut, apparently the next victim of the SoMa Slasher. Her partner, who  happens to be the pathologist's husband, is implicated and on the run.  Then, to make life just perfect, there's a lot of unrelieved sexual tension  between herself and a strong, silent type lieutenant working Internal  Affairs.<br />I hope Burcell isn't planning on hanging up her service pistol  anytime soon. While this novel represents a 2-star commendable effort, it  doesn't stand out in the glut of books of the same genre. Kate, as the  Protagonist of the plot, just barely elicits sympathy. (For a brief moment,  I almost liked her for the relationship she has with her landlord's orange  tabby, Dinky. But, alas, Dinky is briefly mentioned maybe twice, then  ignored.) There's no single, clear Antagonist, just several possibles - and  none of them exude evil intent. Finally, the disparate elements come  together in a nearly incoherent ending that is anticlimactic even for this  pedestrian plot. There was no cleverness here - nothing that elicited from  me an admiring \\"Way cool!\\"<br />I suspect the author plans on making Kate the  centerpiece of a continuing series of cop stories, and doesn't want to wear  out her character, or get her into the sack with the IA lieutenant, too  quickly. Too bad. She's lost me as a fan already.	2000-08-29

In it, he chronicles the waves of arrival and expansion of the Russian mob in the US. The first  wave came during the period of the Cold War, when the criminals arrived in  the guise of Jewish dissident refugees, settling in Brighton Beach, New  York. The second wave came after the dissolution of the USSR, when the new  freedoms allowed by perestroika opened the floodgates to the Russian  \\"wiseguys\\", some with previous connections to the KGB and military, now  swarming into Miami, Denver and Los Angeles. Since then, the Red Mafiya has  relentlessly extended its tentacles into, and sometimes completely around,  such diverse activities and entities as the Russian government, Wall  Street, the Russian and Swiss banking systems, the State of Israel, and the  US National Hockey League. One of the Mafiya's most startling  characteristics is the viciousness of its members. A viciousness forged  into a steely hardness under Soviet totalitarianism, and which makes the  dons of the Italian Mafia look like a bunch of kindly grandfathers. It  causes one to look fondly back on the bad old days of the Cold War, when at  least the Soviet security apparatus had its indigenous criminals under some  measure of control, i.e. in some Arctic gulag where they could tear at each  other's throats instead of ours.<br />I have mixed feelings about this book.  First of all, it's not one I would've bought on my own - it was a gift. I  mean, living in Southern California I `m well aware that there are  loathsome elements \\"out there\\": mafias of whatever national origin, Latino  gangs, Armenian gangs, Chinese gangs, Vietnamese gangs, South American drug  cartels. Hell, maybe even brotherhoods of Eskimo assassins for all I know.  The best I can do is stay out of their way, much as I avoid dog excrement  on the sidewalk. There's not much I can personally do about them except  support law enforcement agencies with my tax dollars, which, by the way,  are legally extorted from me at 33% or more of my income.  (I might well  wonder which group is hurting me the most.) On the other hand, as the  author points out, the damage that the Red Mafiya is doing to the  Motherland may eventually cause a disgusted populace to elevate to  leadership a Hitler-like figure - and he's going to have nukes to play  with. This is a scary thought. On that basis, I have to applaud Friedman on  the courage it took to write such a fine and informative piece of  investigative journalism in the face of extreme personal danger.

Combat in a theater of World War II that most Americans, dismally familiar only with the fighting role  of the US in the Pacific and Europe, know little about - the Russian Front.  Specifically, in this book, the Battle of Stalingrad at the end of  1942.<br />Chief Master Sergeant Vasily Zaitsev (\\"The Hare\\") is an expert  sniper in the 62nd Army, that force of the Red Army desperately maintaining  a toehold in Stalingrad, under siege by the German 6th Army. Zaitsev is so  good at his job that he is ordered to establish a sniper school. One of his  students is Tania Chernova, an American woman of Russian descent fighting  to avenge the execution of her grandparents at the hands of the Nazis. The  graduates of The Hare's training become so proficient at killing Germans  that the morale of the 6th Army's front-line troops is seriously  threatened. Zaitsev becomes a Red Army hero and a winner of the Order of  Lenin. As a counter, the Reich's most expert sniper, SS Colonel Heinz  Thorvald (\\"The Headmaster\\"), is flown from Germany into the Stalingrad  battle. His orders - to find and kill The Hare.<br />There is no superlative  too extravagant to describe this book. At 470 pages in paperback, I  absorbed it at one sitting on a flight from Washington, DC to Los Angeles.  Zaitsev, Chernova and Thorvald were all actual combatants in Stalingrad.  Their roles, as well as the movements of both the German and Russian forces  in the battle as a whole, are facts lifted from historical sources  researched by the author, David Robbins. The insight Robbins gives the  reader into the skills and training of the military sniper is absolutely  riveting. The action is gritty and realistic. The characters are finely  drawn.<br />One measure of a novel's excellence is its ability to inspire the  reader to delve further into the subject. I've just added to my Amazon.com  Wish List a history of the Stalingrad siege.	2000-08-25

Extensively  researched, it answers any questions you may have had about London during  that period, and many more you wouldn't have thought to ask. The author,  Liza Picard, leaves no stone unturned to describe the condition and  characteristics of the streets, water supply, pollution, waste disposal,  the great fire of 1666, houses, interior decorating, heating, lighting,  furniture, gardens, parks, postal service, medicine, dentistry, clothing,  jewelry, cosmetics, hairdressing, housework, shopping, markets, payment,  prices, cooking, recipes, drink, the household master and mistress,  children, apprentices, servants, slaves, pets, education, etiquette, the  arts, music, dancing, excursions, the law, marriage, divorce, crime, taxes,  contracts, wills, the rich, the poor, the \\"middling sort\\", the Church of  England, the Church of Rome, the Jews, astrology, superstitions,  witchcraft, and everybody's favorite - sex.<br />Unless, like I do, you think  London the greatest city on earth, or are just interested in urban life in  past times, you may find this book a bit over the top. However, Picard  entertains, and informs, with a dry wit that is perhaps too infrequently  demonstrated. Consider this on the role of physicians:<br />\\"Poor Charles II,  dying of a stroke and kidney failure, had to suffer bleeding and enemas,  cantharides on his scalp and red-hot irons on his feet, as well as a total  of 58 drugs, all in his last five days. The energy of his physicians was  much admired in professional circles.&quot;	2000-08-10

A genetic disorder characterized by a severe  sensitivity to UV radiation, especially sunlight that results in cumulative  and irreversible damage to one's DNA. Thus afflicted, Chris Snow in FEAR  NOTHING has lived his 28 years in the Central California coastal town of  Moonlight Bay. He cannot expose his eyes or skin to the least amount of  sunlight lest he risk the certainly fatal onslaught of cancer. He sleeps by  day, and wanders the environs of his community by night, financially  supported by his writings and a substantial trust fund.<br />At the beginning  of the brief, but busy, thirty-six hour period spanned by this novel's  plot, Chris attends the death of his father, his last surviving parent.  Subsequently, he discovers his father's body has been switched on it's way  to the crematorium for that of a dead vagrant by a mysterious stranger, is  attacked (several times) by a band of murderous super monkeys, is present  at the murder of one of his best friends, kills the town's chief of police,  is almost bludgeoned by the local priest, learns his deceased mother was  the brains behind a top secret military project involving inter-species  gene transfer experiments, and comes to learn that his pet dog, Orson, can  understand spoken English as well as you or I. It seems Orson, a gift from  his mother, was a product of those same genetic experiments, which have  since taken a decidedly sinister and cataclysmic turn. Of course, the  wicked government is trying to cover up the whole debacle. It isn't stated  whether it's the Republicans or Democrats in power. (Oh, for a return to  the more benign peccadilloes of Bill and Monica! The only casualty of  that... um, gene transfer experiment ... was the Blue Dress.)<br />This is a  standard offering by Dean Koontz, whose brand of scary stories has always  seemed a bit more twisted and raw than those of the other Terror Meister,  Stephen King. Nevertheless, it's a swell read. Snow is a sympathetic  character, and Orson is way cool. Since the world as we and Snow know it is  doomed, it's readily apparent from the somewhat anticlimactic ending that  Koontz intended this book to be the first in a series about Chris, Orson,  Moonlight Bay, and the secret project gone awry.

I wouldn't have thought that the subject of dirt could be so interesting. However, in BITING THE DUST, author Margaret Horsfield relates the history of housework. More specifically, she focuses on housecleaning, an activity  that acquired a life of its own during the period of society's industrial  expansion and the decline of traditional cottage industries, when the wife  was left stranded at home while the husband joined the factory workforce.  It evolved to an obsession beginning in the late 19th century when the germ  theory of disease became widely accepted, and \\"germs\\" became synonymous  with \\"filth\\" - most alarmingly, all that household filth: dust, grease,  flies, mold, excrement, hair, drain slime, fungus, mites, cockroaches,  bacteria, fleas, dry rot, cobwebs, rust, exfoliated skin, mildew, waxy  buildup. Oh, yuuuuck!<br />Margaret is British-born, so the focus of her study  is more on England than the United States, the latter being the place where  the \\"science\\" of housecleaning reached its zenith first, the UK being  inhibited by its proximity to two world wars. However, being British, she  writes with a wry and self-deprecating humor that is most entertaining. In  my mind, the best chapters are four. \\"Mothers and Mentors: The Influence of  Mothers On How We Clean\\" is self explanatory, as are \\"Clean Freaks and  Crazies: The Extremes of Housecleaning\\" and \\"Purge and Purify: Bugs,  Beasties and Other Household Intruders\\". Then, since the book is otherwise  mostly about (and probably for) women, there's \\"Looking for Mr. Clean\\", a  chapter devoted to those two human subspecies: the Man Who Cleans and the  Man Who Doesn't Care, the latter existing in overwhelming numbers, much  like pigs.<br />What prevents me from awarding five stars is the fact that Ms.  Horsfield occasionally goes on longer than necessary. Her chapter on the  development of home economics and household advice and that on the rise of  domestic consumerism are cases in point. Overall, though, I found the book  both engaging and instructive - a minor miracle, I suppose, because I'm  Male. It served me well this past weekend during my breaks taken while  doing the laundry and ironing. And I'm trained to put the toilet seat down,  too.

Our hero - a loose use of the term - is Muirtagh, chief of the Clan &oacute; Cullinane, who becomes reluctantly embroiled in a resumption of a blood feud that almost wiped out  his clan when his father was chief. After the High King of Ireland refuses  to intervene on behalf of peace, Muirtagh's brother is slain by men of the  &oacute; Cullinane's main rival, the Clan mac Mahon. In order to draw off his  enemies from pursuing the surviving remnants of his clan, Muirtagh  renounces his claim to the chieftainship, and departs into the wilds of  western Ireland as a self-declared outlaw. Subsequently, he joins forces  with the Irish rebel leader Maelmordha and his Viking allies in a  confrontation with the High King and his army.<br />It all sounds terribly  exciting, but isn't. The book is relatively short (205 pages in paperback),  and the author spends fully the first half establishing for the reader the  relationship between Muirtagh and his wife, his children, his brother, the  High King, and his clan's rivals. Several pages would've sufficed. Then,  there's a brief flurry of activity when Muirtagh's brother is killed,  followed by another stretch of boredom until the final battle in the last  twenty-five pages. At the conclusion of it all, the extent of the happy  ending is that Muirtagh still lives as a free man. Nothing else is decided,  won, regained or achieved. By then, I didn't care.<br />The book has a  superfluity of unpronounceable names, incoherent conversations, and minor  characters. While the whole might serve as a couple of chapters in a longer  novel, by itself it is utterly and totally pointless. Had it been any  longer, I would have disdained to finish.<br />Normally, I give my books away  to friends. This one I simply trashed.	2000-07-28

In MAN OF THE HOUR, the reader is reminded that glory is fleeting, especially when  driven by the capricious print and television media. David Fitzgerald is an English teacher, and a darn good one, at the Coney Island  High School. (I consider teaching one of the most honorable of professions,  more so than even medicine or law. I can still remember the handful of  really excellent teachers in my life. But, I digress.) One day, the bus on  which David is to take his class on a field trip is destroyed by a bomb.  Luckily, only two people were aboard at the time, the driver and a pregnant  student. The driver dies, but Fitzgerald risks his life to save the girl.  He immediately becomes the media's darling hero of the moment.  Unfortunately, because of circumstance, ambiguous evidence, and confused  statements David made after the blast, he soon becomes the chief suspect,  and the media turns on him with a savage vengeance.<br />We know from the very  beginning that the real bomber is limo driver Nasser, an ex-student of  Fitzgerald's, who is a 24-year old of Palestinian birth previously  imprisoned by the Israelis. This experience leaves him hating Israel and,  of course, the pro-Zionist American society and everything for which it  stands. Now, in America, Nasser has fallen in with a couple of moth-eaten,  sad-to-be-alive Arab terrorists that manage to give even that profession a  bad name. Thus, the plot inspired very little suspense in this reader, only  a mild curiosity as to how the author would redress the balance in order to  achieve the de rigueur happy ending.<br />David is a likable enough character,  especially as he's also embroiled in a child custody battle with an ex-wife  who, in the technical jargon of psychiatry, is \\"just plain nuts\\".  As a  bombing suspect, he also faces loss of his job and imprisonment. Definitely  the makings of a bad hair day. Nonetheless, neither my sympathy for  Fitzgerald, nor my esteem for teachers in general, compels me to award this  novel anything more than a marginal \\"thumbs up\\".ard this  novel anything more than a marginal \\"thumbs up\\".	2000-07-26

In the last chapter of THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JOSEPH STALIN, it is a week after the August 1940 assassination of Leon Trotsky in Mexico City, and the Soviet dictator is wrapping up his narrative history of the events that led  up to the successful ax murder of his archrival by a conspiracy that he  personally directed. In previous chapters, Stalin tells the story of his  life as a young boy in Russian Georgia, as a young communist revolutionary,  as an associate of Lenin before and after the Revolution, and as the  dictator that assumed total power after Lenin's death in 1924 by destroying  all of his old Bolshevik comrades. All events are related in the context of  his paranoid fear and hatred of Trotsky who, in his Mexican exile, is  apparently assembling a biography of the Soviet leader - a biography that  will reveal to the world Stalin's ultimate crime against Russia and the  Revolution, and which will hopefully spark his downfall. Thus, according to  Stalin, the necessity of having to effect Trotsky's murder. (After all,  even paranoids have enemies.)<br />Of course, Stalin wrote no autobiography  for the world to ponder. This book is a novel written by Richard Lourie. It  is absorbing and interesting only to the degree that the facts of Stalin's  life and Trotsky's death, as related herein, are historically true. Since  Lourie has a Ph.D. in Russian, and has written previously on Russian  history, I give him the benefit of the doubt. I was both absorbed and  fascinated by the author's Stalin, a personality so isolated and  megalomaniacal as to be able to \\"write\\" at the very end:<br />\\"Now I know what  my name really means: Stalin is the strength to bear a world in which there  is only nothing and yourself.

VOODOO SCIENCE: THE ROAD FROM FOOLISHNESS TO FRAUD is a book length editorial by Robert Park addressing the various manifestations of voodoo science that have surfaced, and, in some cases still persist, in  contemporary modern society. Himself an accomplished physicist, Park  divides \\"voodoo science\\" into pathological science, junk science and  pseudoscience. Pathological science occurs when scientists fool themselves.  Junk science involves tortured theories unsupported by evidence, such as  those presented to juries to secure big personal injury awards.  Pseudoscience is humbug dressed up in the symbols and language of true  science. At any one time, a manifestation of voodoo science will occupy a  non-static position in the continuum between foolishness and downright  fraud. Self-delusion being what it is, it's sometimes difficult to judge  when an individual crosses the line between True Believer and Scam  Artist.<br />Park takes issue with voodoo science via a list of examples long  enough to probably offend just about anyone who thinks him/herself a  forward thinker on the Cutting Edge. Among those that Park asserts are  clearly debunked, or should be, by now: cold fusion, x-ray lasers (a.k.a.  Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative), perpetual motion machines, gravity  shields, the Roswell Incident, cancers caused by power lines, and  pathologic conditions caused by ruptured silicone breast implants. Then,  there are those still considered acceptably mainstream, but equally  dubious: touch therapy (i.e. aura manipulation), magnet therapy, the manned  Mars mission, the International Space Station, and homeopathic  medicines.<br />Park editorializes with a sense of humor and mild outrage  against the natures of the government and the popular media that promote  the acceptance of such foolishness in our collective psychology, rather  than providing standards for critical analysis.  After all, it's National  Enquirer-like journalism that sells papers and generates high TV ratings  for the media fat cats. And the government ... well, what could one expect  from a group composed mostly of scientifically unsophisticated dunderheads.

I do wish Amazon would adopt a more flexible rating system!)<br />In ROSE, it is 1872. Jonathan Blair, a down-on-his-luck explorer/mining engineer/surveyor, is sick with malaria in  miasmic, damp London. His only desire is to return to his beloved Africa.  To that end, he approaches his sponsor on a previous surveying expedition  to the African Gold Coast, Bishop Hannay, and pleads for renewed  employment. Hannay agrees, on the condition that Blair first visit the  bleak coal mining town of Wigan in the English county of Lancashire to  investigate the disappearance of the local Anglican curate, one John  Maypole. (Here, I must briefly digress. Bishop Hannay is also Lord Hannay,  the family head of a huge industrial empire that manufactures everything  from bricks to locomotives, and owns the principal mine in Wigan, itself a  Hannay company town. I'm not sure why the author, Martin Cruz Smith,  bothered to make Hannay a bishop, since no reference is ever made to his  episcopal see, cathedral, or duties.) In any case, Blair reluctantly  accepts the task. In Wigan, he encounters mysterious deaths, local thugs,  the rest of Hannay's dysfunctional family, and the enigmatic \\"pit girl\\"  Rose Molyneux. Our hero soon discovers that the missing Maypole, though  engaged to Hannay's cold and waspish daughter Charlotte, had become  amorously obsessed with Rose, a passion eventually shared by Blair, and  which complicates his life enormously.<br />If the plot of this potboiler had  taken place in a contemporary time in, say, New York or Los Angeles, or  even rural Appalachia, it would not have gotten off the ground. The action  tends to plod. What saves it, in this case, is the period and location. I  trust Smith researched the environment of 19th century, English coal towns  and mines before undertaking this novel. Inasmuch as his research is  presumably accurate, the local color is instructional and interesting.  Moreover, there is an unexpected plot twist at the end when Blair discovers  Rose to be  ... well, you'll find out when you read it.

On the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 2, 1863, the left end of the Union line came under attack by the right end of the Confederate line. On the slope of Little Round Top, the very last Union regiment in the  line, the 20th Maine, commanded by Joshua Chamberlain, desperately fought  off repeated assaults by the 15th Alabama regiment, commanded by William  Oates. It is quite likely the Gettysburg battle could have been won for  General Lee's Army of Northern Virginia if the Alabama troops had  successfully flanked the Union position and gotten into the rear of General  Meade's Army of the Potomac. For the Federals, it was a close run thing.  The 20th Maine prevailed only when, after running out of ammunition,  Chamberlain ordered the famous bayonet charge that finally routed the  exhausted Southern troops - a feat of arms thrillingly depicted in the 1993  film \\"Gettysburg\\".<br />CONCEIVED IN LIBERTY is a double biography of both  Oates and Chamberlain painted in broad brushstrokes. For each, it spans the  time from birth, through the formative period of young manhood, then the  army career, concluding with the post-war years of public service, and  finally death. Interestingly enough, Chamberlain and Oates faced off only  once during the Civil War conflict, and only twice in life. The second  instance, when both were old men, involved a squabble over where the 15th  Alabama's regimental marker could properly be placed on the Gettysburg  Battlefield Monument. Chamberlain won that round also, as the marker was  never erected.<br />For the Civil War buff seeking detailed accounts of the  major battles, this is not the book to read. Only those major engagements  at which Chamberlain and/or Oates were present are described, and then only  to the degree that establishes the \\"big picture\\", or otherwise provides the  details of each man's participation in the larger conflict. For example,  the author, Mark Perry, gives a reasonably detailed 7-page overview of  Gettysburg's first day, then provides an 11-page narrative summary of the  Little Round Top confrontation between our two heroes.

Subsequently, Sir Francis, Hal and the rest of the Lady  Edwina's company are betrayed by a former ally, the Scottish Earl of  Cumbrae, with the help of a former crewmember, Sam Bowles, and imprisoned  at Good Hope. Sir Francis is brutally tortured and executed. Hal and a  handful of survivors later escape, acquire another ship, and go on to  defeat their primary tormentors, Cumbrae and a Dutch army colonel named  Schreuder, against the backdrop of a war between the Christian Emperor of  Ethiopia and the Moslem Sultan of Oman. Along the way, Hal inherits his  father's captaincy and finds true love (as opposed to hormonal-driven sex  with Katinka) - twice.<br /><br />As painted by the author, Wilbur Smith, the chief  characters of this swashbuckling adventure are almost caricatures. The  \\"good guys\\" - principally Hal and his loyal buddies, Aboli, Ned, and Daniel  - are brave, noble and heroic.  The \\"bad guys\\" - Katinka, Governor van de  Velde, Bowles, Cumbrae, and Schreuder - are cruel, dishonorable and totally  vile. The action, much as in Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones film trilogy, is  wildly improbable, especially over the book's latter half. Similarly,  however, that same action is scripted with such exuberance and energy that  it's totally engaging. Finally, I read to be transported to places that, in  most cases, I will never visit. I doubt that I shall ever ply the Indian  Ocean or South Atlantic aboard a frigate under sail.

As a 9 year old Enfant Terrible at the beginning of KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL, the author, Anthony Bourdain, discovers the power of food while on a vacation in France with his brother and parents. More to the point, he discovers food's power to shock and amaze as he eats local delicacies that otherwise make the rest of his family gag. By his own admission, he enters young manhood as \\" a spoiled, miserable, narcissistic, self-destructive and thoughtless young lout, badly in need of a good ... kicking\\". Then, he got his first job as a restaurant dishwasher. By the end of the book, Bourdain is executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles in New York City. In between, we follow his upward advancement through the culinary hierarchy: salad station, broiler station, independent caterer, line cook, sous-chef, executive chef. More often than not during the first half of his career, he admits to being stoned on one or another controlled substance. However, Bourdain also has an evident talent for cooking and organization, and by the book's second half he's sobered up and on his way to a career of distinction.<br />Reviews of CONFIDENTIAL laud the author's wicked wit as he reveals to us the uninitiated the secrets of the kitchen behind those swinging doors. Was it witty? Not really. Was it informative? Yes, but do I really need to know that the Rainbow Room's locker-room was a \\"gruesome panorama of dermatological curiosities ... boils, pimples, ingrown hair, rashes, buboes, lesions and skin rot ...\\" Or, that the odors of the place \\"combined to form a noxious, penetrating cloud that followed you home, and made you smell as if you'd been rolling around in sheep guts\\".  Hmm, local color perhaps.<br />To be fair, there are one or two terrific chapters, particularly \\"How to Cook Like the Pros\\", in which Bourdain lists and describes what the pro absolutely needs, and \\"A Day In the Life\\", in which he describes a typical, grueling day on the job from 6:00 AM to near midnight. Clearly, it isn't a career choice for a couch potato.<br />I guess my greatest objection, and disappointment, was that I just never liked the guy. While enormously talented, he's also way too self-absorbed. He's an Enfant Terrible grown into a Jerk. His best buddies, also in the biz, are apparently just as professionally talented and personally dysfunctional. He barely mentions Nancy, his wife, who has to put up with him, and is quite likely a saint. His disdain for the paying public is often glaring, as when he refers to weekend diners as \\"rubes\\". Well, this is one Rube who would just as soon dine on slop at the local Denny's than sit down to his finest creation ENDcareer choice for a couch potato.<br />I guess my greatest objection, and disappointment, was that I just never liked the guy.

Back in the early 90's, the world was presented with LEADERSHIP SECRETS OF ATTILA THE HUN, which, as I recall, was a book with some serious points to make that happened to have a cute title. WHAT WOULD MACHIAVELLI DO?, also  with a cute title, is apparently a parody of the former volume and others  of the same ilk. At least I hope it's a parody. The author, Stanley Bing,  can't be serious, can he? The book is a do-it-yourself guide to getting  ahead by being the most paranoid, meanest, most selfish, most amoral, most  secretive, greediest, most narcissistic, and most treacherous SOB on the  block.<br />Assuming this is a parody, it's written with a modicum of  cleverness and twisted humor, eminently suitable for those moments  dedicated to light reading in the bathroom. Bing's brief reference to the  virtue of patience is typical:<br />\\"You know ... I could go on about this but  screw it. Patience is for pussies. We don't need to spend a lot of time on  this concept, do we? Good. Let's move on.\\"<br />And, concerning  rudeness:<br />\\"Rudeness: Watch people reel back when you put your hand over  their faces and push real hard.\\"<br />Okey-dokey. How about these for your  library: NERO'S FIRESIDE CHAT COLLECTION, or UNCLE JOE STALIN'S FOLKSY  ADVICE ON RURAL IMPROVEMENT, or, my personal favorite, TIPS FROM THE  REICHSKANZLER ON POLITICAL CORRECTNESS by A.

On a balmy, summer's evening in Southern California during the mid-60's, I tune my transistor radio to KFI, and loop the handstrap around my bicycle's handlebar.  Peddling aimlessly through the darkening twilight, my thoughts  are solely on the vision conjured  up by the Voice of the Dodgers, Vin  Scully. I remember as if it was only yesterday...<br />\\"On the mound tonight  for the Los Angeles Dodgers ... number 32 ... the great left-hander...  Sandy Koufax\\".<br />\\"Koufax\\", by Edward Gruver, brings it all back. It's more  than just a straightforward biography. The backbone of the book is a  narrative of Sandy's gutsy, phenomenal performance in the seventh game of  the 1965 World Series with the Minnesota Twins, relived batter by batter  and pitch by pitch, at roughly one inning per chapter. The author fleshes  out each inning's action with the story of Koufax's life: parents,  childhood, education, religion, early baseball career, peak baseball  career, teammates, adversaries, pitching style, injuries, retirement, and  post retirement. And enough pitching stats to satisfy even the most  hardball of fans. My only criticism might be that the author's evident hero  worship of his subject is almost slavish. However, who am I to criticize  considering the knuckle-biting attention I paid to Sandy's every outing,  every pitch and every decision? This is a must-have book about a truly  great gentleman and ballplayer.<br />Thirty-four years after my hero's final  walk to the mound, I'm no longer a baseball fan, much less a follower of  the Dodgers. Nowadays, star baseball (and football, and basketball) players  seem to get more media attention when they abuse drugs, commit felony  assault or rape, or are just downright obnoxious. Yes, I suppose  professional athletes have always had their darker side, but the paying  fans rarely heard about it, and the reputation of The Game was the better  for it. For me, there are no present-day heroes. But, if I surrender to  memory on a balmy, Southern California, summer evening, I can still hear  Vin Scully across the decades ...<br />\\"Sandy looks in to Roseboro for the  sign ...

Thus, when faced with the escalating sexual demands of male friends, she doesn't know how to ratchet down the intensity. Rather than hurt their  feelings with rejection, she kills them. Nothing personal, you understand,  she only wants to be decent about it.<br />Enter Sam, a former KGB crack  assassin. Now that the Cold war is over, he lives in the U.S. working as a  contract killer. He encounters Grace while randomly testing a wireless  eavesdropping system, and something in her demeanor prompts him to begin  following her around. He becomes witness to her killings, and is fascinated  by her modus operandi and what he speculates to be her motives and state of  mind. He is smitten.<br />The book's 55 chapters - they're short - alternate  back and forth between the Grace and Sam viewpoints. As the two eventually  meet and establish a relationship, each acts as a therapist for the other.  Grace acquires self-assurance and fortitude. Sam becomes a more  compassionate hit man.<br />This novel by Jen Sacks is quirky enough to be  worth buying. Some readers may also perceive in it nuggets of insight  regarding the dating/mating ritual between the sexes. The ending is neither  profound nor unexpected. It's, well ...NICE.	2000-06-07

In this lucid and riveting piece of non-fiction, author James Stewart turns over a rock, and out crawls Michael Swango - clean-cut, all-American physician and ostensible serial murderer. We follow Swango from his  upbringing in a terminally dysfunctional family, through medical school at  Southern Illinois University, on to (failed) specialty residencies at Ohio  State University, the University of South Dakota, and the State University  of New York, and finally to a bizarre stint as a practicing physician at  two hospitals in the Republic of Zimbabwe. Beginning at OSU, he leaves  behind a trail of dead patients and some very sick acquaintances, friends  and lovers. No Dr. Kildare this, his favorite pharmaceuticals are the likes  of arsenic, ricin, and cyanide. Despite the evidence, he has been convicted  only twice - once for poisoning coworkers, none of whom died, and once for  falsifying information on a residency application.<br />I have not been, nor  will I ever be, a fan of the \\"true crime reporting\\" genre of books. Any  minimally aware individual knows there are a lot of sociopathic, psychotic  and otherwise dangerous people on the loose. It's the good luck of most of  us not to run into any in the course of a lifetime. It doesn't add to the  pleasures of my life to read about them, and will usually only do so if  their impact on real-life history has been disproportionately great.  Therefore, I confess to an occasional fascination with the likes of Hitler  and Stalin. (And the villains in the fictional works I enjoy generally get  a satisfying comeuppance.) Personally, I found \\"Blind Eye\\", though  admirably written, to be frustrating and infuriating. Infuriating because  it shows how Swango breached the barriers supposedly set up to protect  society at large, with the help, in this case, of a particularly spineless,  arrogant and self-serving group of physician-administrator weasels at the  OSU Medical Center. Frustrating because Swango has yet to brought to  justice for murder, mostly because of the difficulties in garnering  evidence that will support indictments for crimes committed many years ago,  or in a foreign country, by methods that leave nebulous traces at best.  Currently serving a federal prison term for fraud, he is due for release no  later than July 2000. The author feels he will certainly try to practice  \\"medicine\\" again - somewhere. It should give the reader pause to consider  where that might be. (Been looking for a new family doctor lately?  Hmmm?)<br />In a reasonable society, a solid citizen would not be condemned  for shooting a mad dog on sight. Michael Swango is one twisted, sick puppy.

Growing up in Mississippi, that was only way a Manly Man could be. In \\"My Cat Spit McGee\\", the author describes his conversion to an  ailurophile, or cat-lover, an epiphany apparently of the same magnitude as  that experienced by Saul of Tarsus (a.k.a. St. Paul) on the road to  Damascus.<br />Through association with his second wife, JoAnne, and after a  series of response-modifying events, the author finds a boon companion in  Spit McGee, a shorthaired, all-white male cat with one blue and one gold  eye. It's in this short book's - 141 pages, hardcover - second half that  Willie describes both the understanding that develops between himself and  his new feline pal, as well as the personalities of Spit and several other  family cats that won him over.<br />If you're not an ailurophile, or not  someone confronted by fickle circumstance with a forced conversion, there's  no reason to even crack this book open. For myself, a cat-lover of long  standing, this gentle and heartwarming story made me appreciate more than  ever my calico buddy, Trouble. Willie died in 1999, leaving Spit behind.  Since I'm 51 and Trouble is approaching 9, there is a good chance that my  furry friend will predecease me. I will rue the coming of that day. I shall  miss her terribly.	2000-05-30

Twelve years ago, Peter Mayle gifted us with \\"A Year In Provence\\", an account of this expatriate Brit's plunge into Gallic life, revolving around the pleasures and pitfalls of establishing a residence in rural France in  an old country house that was somewhat of a \\"fixer-upper\\". Several  Provence-related books later, and after a period of time living on Long  Island, Peter and his wife return to the land they (and we) love. The  result is \\"Encore Provence\\". The latest book doesn't hold together as well  as \\"Year\\", the elements of the latter forming a more cohesive whole.  However, \\"Encore\\" is certainly much better than some of his other books  written in the interim.<br />In \\"Encore\\", Peter briefly revisits several  topics covered in the original, as well as several more which were  apparently overlooked. The range is quixotic: the cultivation of olive  trees, an explanation of the three grades of virgin olive oil, the smelly  art of selecting fragrances for designing perfumes, foie gras as the key to  longevity, discovering the perfect corkscrew, touring Marseille, the  almost-underworld of the village truffle market, how to execute the  Provençal full shrug, the obligatory elements of the Provençal village,  and, umm ..... the shotgun murder of an amorous meat cutter. And, of  course, many hedonistic references to the local food and wine. All are  treated in the utterly charming and dryly humorous Mayle-style that makes  his books so delightful.<br />Bravo and merci beaucoup, Mr. Mayle! You've  provided another enjoyable spice to my life.	2000-05-29

The essence of this great man's  life is more concisely presented in Alfred Lansing's \\"Endurance:  Shackleton's Incredible Voyage\\", a much shorter work that specifically  chronicles the quest of the ship Endurance, a failed South Polar expedition  that metamorphosed into a remarkable odyssey of incredible hardship and  gritty survival, and a tribute to Shackleton's ability to lead men to hell  and back - without the loss of even a single life.

As far as a Stephen King book goes, this is a little one - 262 pages in paperback, but a keeper. Within, young 9-year old Trisha becomes lost in the Maine woods after leaving her Mom and brother on the Appalachian Trail  to answer Nature's call. By the time she emerges from the wilderness more  than a week later, she's mosquito ravaged, nearly starved, suffering from  double pneumonia and hallucinations, filthy, ragged, and in the process of  being stalked by a malevolent bear. Not an adventure for sissies.<br />I  cannot remember a King novel that presents the reader with such an  attractive main character. And, in this book, Trisha is, for all intents  and purposes, the only character. A bravura one-girl performance. The fact  that she survives at all is due mostly to an incredible amount of pluck  that would make even the most indifferent of parents proud. She is also  buoyed-up during moments of despair by the presence of her Walkman, on  which she listens to broadcasts of games played by her beloved team, the  Boston Red Sox. On the team is relief pitcher Tom Gordon, on whom she has a  Major League Crush. It's not surprising, therefore, that some of her  hallucinations feature her stalwart hero. The odd thing is, though, his  ghostly presence at one point specifically directs her to the right path  towards rescue. Hmmm ...<br />This is not a \\"scary\\" tale in the Stephen King  tradition. Rather it's one of True Grit in the face of almost overwhelming  adversity, with just a hint of the paranormal. A cautionary tale (\\"Stay on  the path!\\") with a feel-good ending that might inspire you to touch the  visor of your favorite team's baseball cap, and point your index finger to  the sky.	2000-05-25

In \\"Falling Off the Map\\", Pico Iyer's tales of wanderlust transport the reader to North Korea, Argentina, Cuba, Iceland, Bhutan, Vietnam, Paraguay and Australia, all of which are Lonely Places outside the world's  mainstream either by choice, geography or circumstance. I was a bit  surprised that no country on the African continent was included, as I have  to believe that some backwaters of one or another decayed, European,  colonial empire have acquired independence to become, well, backwaters by  other names. Perhaps Pico hasn't looked at an atlas lately, or he didn't  find the prospect of the Dark Continent's climate particularly appealing.<br />Because Vietnam monopolized so much of America's collective  consciousness in the 60's and 70's, the chapter dedicated to that country  was, to me, the most informative and intriguing - and I didn't even serve  there, or anywhere near it, during my years with the U.S. Navy. Though  ostensibly a communist state, Iyer is careful to note that Vietnam's  lingering animosity is with the Chinese, not the U.S., even though it was  the latter that bombed, defoliated and napalmed the country for years.  Americans, and their $, are most welcome. I've decided that I owe it to  myself to visit the place, just to see the patch of real estate that we  made such a fuss over.<br />The author's observations of all the Lonely Places  are recorded as viewed through lenses of keen perception and dry humor. He  was, after all, born British. In \\"Falling Off the Map\\", Iyer has  accomplished what I think most travel writers set out to do, i.e., convince  their readers to see for themselves what will otherwise remain simply as  mental images conjured from a page. Though I will likely never visit all,  or even a minority, of these quirky locales, I really wish I could.	2000-05-17

To get the reader started in this delightful little book, the authors introduce the Julius Work Calendar, another book created around the year 1020, now in the British Library in London. In its time, it served as a  perpetual calendar, which allowed the user to determine the dates of  ecclesiastical holidays (such as Easter) and festivals, occurrences of the  new moon, the dates of a particular day of the week, and the number of  hours of daylight and darkness during any of the year's twelve months. Each  month's page in the Calendar is illustrated with the drawing of an activity  associated with that month, e.g. plowing in January, feasting in April,  sheep herding in May, harvesting in July and August, boar hunting in  September, and so on. In following chapters of \\"The Year 1000\\",  one per  month, life for the first millennium English citizen is described in loose  association with the activity depicted by the drawing. It's as if, in the  year 3000, an author was to describe life in the year 2000, using as an  entr&eacute;e into the subject a calendar contemporary to the period - no, NOT a  swimsuit calendar - which had photos of activities that we in America  associate with each month, e.g. snow skiing in January, baseball in April,  boating in August, football in October, Thanksgiving dinner in November,  etc. Maybe the very front of the Y2K calendar would feature a picture of  freeway gridlock in Los Angeles, since it seems to be a perpetual  state.<br />As the authors point out, there is more historical documentation  concerning President Clinton's dalliance with Monica than has survived  concerning all of everyday life in England at the end of the first  millennium. Thus, the shortness of the book. However, I was absolutely  charmed by it, no doubt due to my love for all things English and British.  Well, maybe not Lemon Shandy or haggis. In any case, it is written in an  easy, conversational style incorporating many tidbits of non-earthshaking  fact. Did you know, for instance, that Y1K ale had the consistency of  porridge, or that the concept of five baths per year was considered  fanatical overkill, or that thunder on Sunday was thought to presage an  increased death rate among nuns and monks? No?

As a very young girl, Ellen is in her father's office when he is murdered by two intruders. The actual shooter is never identified or caught. His accomplice, Walker, is convicted and serves 30 years in prison. On his release, Ellen tracks Walker down with the intent of forcing him to tell  her who the shooter was (or is, so she can find and kill him). To  accomplish this, she disappears suddenly and without warning out of the  suburban Dallas life that she shares with her recently-adulterous husband,  Pete, intentionally obliterating \\"every trace\\" of her plan and movements as  she stalks her quarry. Pete, in turn, is left to frantically track her down  because, of course, he still loves her.<br />This is the first novel by Greg  Main, an occasional screenwriter, and it shows. The plot and characters are  painted in broad brushstrokes that lend the story to a Sunday night,  TV-movie adaptation. However, just as it doesn't have the makings for a big  screen film, it's also not of the caliber of a first rate piece of fiction.<br />The story line sprints to a predictable finish: the good guys win and  the bad guys are killed off, and, for good measure, Ellen's marriage with  Pete is saved. The one particularly good plot element is the love/hate  relationship that develops between Ellen and Walker. Because of this twist,  I've given Greg 4 stars for effort, though the novel as a whole is closer  to a 3.	2000-05-10

In 1992, The United States and Russia signed an accord allowing the citizens of each country the right to travel freely throughout the territory of the other, thus reversing years of Cold War policy that had  closed off access to cities and immense tracts of land to the respective  peregrinations of both \\"commie comrades\\" and \\"imperialist warmongers\\".  In  this book, Mark Taplin, an employee of unexplained duties who represents  Washington's Foggy Bottom in Mother Russia, records his observations as he  visits newly \\"Open Lands\\" at the far margins of his host country.<br />Taplin  is one of those intelligent, observant individuals who can write a travel  monologue that is appealing to intelligent, curious readers that want more  out of life than driving to Disney World in the family SUV. His honest, yet  sympathetic, portrayal of post-Soviet Russia and the condition of its  people in such places as Vorkuta (the former center of Uncle Joe's Gulag),  Tannu Tuva (on the edge of Mongolia), and Vladivostok (\\"Lord of the East\\"),  reveals much of what is wrong, and right, in today's Russian Federation.  What is more, he provides histories of the regions in which he wanders,  salt to the literary meal devoured by those of us who, though we may travel  extensively, will likely never visit these corners of the earth. Finally,  Taplin writes with a sense of humor, an indispensable character trait that  served him especially well as he semi-surreptitiously makes his way to the  interior of the Kamchatka Peninsula and an almost comic encounter with the  Russian secret police.<br />My only complaint, but one that prevents me from  awarding 5 stars to this entertaining and informative volume, is the  failure of the author to include the photos he says he took along the way.  Instead, at the head of each chapter, we are offered a fuzzy,  unenlightening, boring image created by some freelance photographer hack  that adds virtually nothing to the text that follows.

From there, the plot barely meets minimum expectations before its lackluster end 441 pages later.<br />One of the books chief problems is that there are too many characters. The number of rescue team members shouldn't have been more than 5 from the beginning, and no one of them is ever clearly defined to the point that this reader gives a damn. In an awkward attempt to make the team's commander, Colonel Po Tseng, less of an automaton, the author has her in an intense sexual encounter with one of her crew at the story's approximate midpoint - an event totally unrelated to anything prior or subsequent. The situation back at Mission Control on Earth isn't much better. There's chief CAPCOM Dave Christiansen, who, as the possibility of demonic interference with the moon mission is explored, launches off on monologues concerning Mormon theology that are totally useless. He might as well been a Buddhist. Then there's Project Director Dolores Bianco, as faceless a government bureaucrat as you'll ever have the misfortune to encounter, whose only claim to prominence in this fractured fairy tale is her adolescent crush on Lt. Gutierrez, a local homicide cop wheeled in to investigate from afar the obvious foul play on the lunar surface. \\"Investigate\\" is a loose use of the term here. He would have served the story line just as well had he been some hunk called in to fix Bianco's office copier.<br />The major fault with this stinker, however, is that the reader, much less the rescue team, never learns what happened at Farside. Was it demonic possession, a crew mutiny, occult rituals, or temporary insanity brought on by severe electromagnetic disturbances as the moonbase went from sunlight to darkness? Like the rescue team actually does (with only 20 pages left to go), the reader's best hope for answers would seem to be consultation of a .... Ouija board, for cryin' out loud!<br />Besides the fact that Amazon's reader review system allows for nothing less than a 1-star rating, there were, to be fair, a couple of reasons why I assigned such a generous score. The description of the technology used to build Farside is reasonably interesting, especially MILTON, the mission's robot explorer. Moreover, the design of the paperback's front cover is visually striking.<br />Please, oh please, don't buy this book. Doing so will only encourage the author to churn out more of the same.temporary insanity brought on by severe electromagnetic disturbances as the moonbase went from sunlight to darkness?

It was hearing John McDermott's heartbreaking rendition of Eric Bogle's \\"And the Band Played waltzing Matilda, the ballad of an Aussie soldier who fights and is maimed at Gallipoli, that inspired me to buy this book about the World War I campaign, one of the British Empire's greatest fiascoes. It  is certainly clear that the military planners in London should have been  court-martialed and shot.<br />This work by Moorehead is eminently readable,  and with sufficient maps to follow the action - oftimes something lacking  in what are otherwise commendable battlefield histories. I would tend to  agree with other reviewers that the story is told too much from the  Empire's point of view. However, though the Turks won the battle, they lost  the wider war with their German allies. So, since a war's victors usually  tell the tale, what's so surprising?

Via his childhood memories, Frank McCourt offers a poignant, unflinching view of a poverty so grinding and oppressive as to certainly be almost unimaginable by most readers. Indeed, I had to frequently remind myself  that the years described were endured not in some pestilential  Victorian-era slum, but in the mid-1900's. My only criticism is the lack of  an epilogue to the story. What ever happened to the elder Malachy McCourt,  Frank's father, a devastating testimonial to a life wasted by alcohol abuse  and a peculiar melancholy which is endemic, I suspect, to the Irish? And  Angela, Frank's mother, a sure candidate for sainthood if measured by her  daily struggles to keep her children fed and alive? I hope God blessed  Angela's ashes and rewarded her with riches in heaven.<br />Oh, and the book  is much better than the movie adaptation (3 stars) as the former has better  continuity between events, though the latter has stunning visuals and  superb acting performances.	2000-04-27

This powerful novel of a young officer's maturation in the crucible of war is most notable for the conflict it describes. Not a war most Americans might otherwise be familiar with - the American Revolution, or the Civil War, or Second World War, or Viet Nam - but rather that exercise in  barbarism, treachery and brutality commenced in the name of God in the Year  of Our Lord 1096 - the First Crusade.<br />Roger, Duke of Lunel, is a minor  French noble in the army of his overlord, Raymond of Saint-Gilles, Count of  Toulouse. Roger's \\"Booke\\", a diary, is a record of events as he follows  Raymond across Europe, to Constantinople, and into the Middle East. Along  the way, he participates in various battles and slaughters of the overt  enemy, the Moslem Turks and Egyptians - most notably at Antioch and  Jerusalem respectively - and witnesses and survives the treachery of  Raymond's supposed Greek and European allies. Enduring the most profound  hardships, Roger discovers \\"himself\\", faith, honor, love, disillusionment  and, finally, loss. After four years, he returns to France in the same  state as he found the Holy Sepulcher - empty.<br />Despite the unhappy ending,  this is a truly wonderful and instructive book, especially for anybody who  is generally interested in the general subject of the Crusades, but seeks a  more specific knowledge. As near as I can tell, the author has  recounted  with reasonable accuracy the events of the First Crusade. While some  license has undoubtedly been taken with the major historical characters -  Raymond of Toulouse, Bohemond of Taranto, Godfrey of Bouillon, Bishop  Adh&eacute;mar of Puy, Pope Urban II, Baldwin of Boulogne, Robert of Normandy,  Peter the Hermit, Emperor Alexius I - it does not, I think, distort the  major brushstrokes of history.<br />More than anything, this novel describes  the emptiness left in a man's soul after all of life's efforts are focused  and expended on one goal, worthwhile or not, to the exclusion of all  others. It is an eloquent argument for a Balanced Perspective.rs. It is an eloquent argument for a Balanced Perspective.	2000-04-23

When I read a spy novel by the likes of Frederick Forsythe or John Le Carr&eacute;, the excellence of such a work reminds me how much trash is written by other authors in the same genre.<br />Forsythe unfolds the events in the  book's first half by switching back and forth between two timelines. The  first, in the year 1999, finds the British Embassy in Moscow coming into  possession of the \\"Black Manifesto\\". This document, written by Igor  Komarov, reveals his secret plan for his rule of Russia once he wins the  presidential election scheduled for January 2000. Since Komarov is far  ahead in the polls, and his Manifesto espouses both military aggression  against surrounding countries and genocide against certain Russian  minorities, the Brits are understandably worried. The second timeline, from  1983 to 1994, follows the upwardly mobile career path of CIA officer Jason  Monk, as he becomes case officer for several key spies within the Soviet  military, intelligence and scientific communities. Over time, Monk watches  helplessly as his agents are betrayed by the real-life CIA turncoat Aldrich  Ames, and subsequently captured, tortured and executed by the sadistic KGB  Colonel Anatoli Grishin. The second half of the book has Monk, separated  from the CIA since 1994, returning to Russia in 1999 on behalf of Western  interests to discredit Komarov and destabilize his campaign for the Russian  presidency. In the process, he matches wits with Grishin, now serving as  Komarov's Chief of Security.<br />One of the strengths of this novel, besides  the intricate plot and fine cast, is the (apparently factual) history of  the Aldrich Ames betrayal, an absolute fiasco on the part of the CIA. This  sort of background information adds immeasurably to any novel, yet is not a  part of so many. In my mind, this writing technique is one of the reasons  why Forsythe is at the top of his profession.<br />The book's action proceeds  at a crisp, clear and riveting pace. It was a book that was difficult to  put down in deference to life's more mundane responsibilities. My only  criticism, and one that prevents me from awarding 5 stars, was the  heavy-handed ending lacking the finesse of what came before. It was as if  Forsythe suddenly found himself faced with a publisher's deadline, and he  had to achieve closure quickly. The final confrontation between Monk and  Grishin was both clumsy and anticlimactic. Despite these closing flaws,  however, the novel is top tier.s difficult to  put down in deference to life's more mundane responsibilities.

Touted as a book of men's away-from-home stories, presumably collected to illustrate the courage and /or foolishness of Manly Men under the influence of excessive testosterone in a dangerous world, it has merit. However, I'm  acquainted with females of the species that would happily go off on similar  adventures, so I'm not convinced that the experiences related are totally a  Guy Thing. In any case, there are some very funny, as well as very  horrific, yarns to be found in these selected twenty-five. Ray Isle's  confrontation with a wild turkey while on a solo, very macho camping trip  is hilarious. Jim Wickwire's memories of a friend's death and his own  survival on a mountain glacier are heartrending, as are Michael Herr's  recollections of the effect of combat on the American troops stationed in  `Nam. Positively chilling is the gritty story of survival under torture in  Moscow's Lubyanka by Slavomir Rawicz. Finally, Larry Habegger makes a  convincing case for middle-aged man's ability to return to the summertime  of youth, however briefly.<br />Admittedly, some of the essays are not  memorable. I may have dozed off while reading William Ashton's \\"A Room of  Men\\" - some blather about a painting. George Wright's \\"Applause in  Calcutta\\" must have been too deep for me because I totally failed to see  the point. \\"No Like A-feesh?\\" by Paul Roberts verged on being just  annoying.<br />A fine read for a Real Man.

All my life I've loved chocolate. Not candy so much, but rather chocolate chip cookies, chocolate donuts, chocolate cake, etc. However, after finishing this literary treat, I find myself eating more chocolate candy in  the space of a week than I used to eat in a year. I've discovered there IS  a distinct difference between the taste of Hershey's chocolate and the  European brands, particularly Cadbury's of England. Even the Cadbury's  manufactured under license by Hershey in Hershey, PA tastes different than  Hershey's! (I hate to appear un-American, but Cadbury's is Number 1 to my  taste buds. And, surprisingly, the Polish brand, Wedel, is next  best.)<br />This book is extremely informative and GREAT FUN. You'll become  privy to such arcane facts as to why the owners of Mars, Inc. hesitate to  put peanuts or peanut butter in their candies, or how some of the Hershey's  workers used to get the Kisses to stick to the foil wrapping on a drafty  assembly line.

This tale of post-Soviet era derring-do has the protagonist, Fluke Kelso, in Moscow, during which time he comes into possession of a handwritten notebook previously possessed by Stalin. After much preliminary dashing about in the capital, the contents of this notebook send our hero careening  north to the rusted-out city of Archangel on the Barents Sea, where he  confronts this potboiler's version of Evil.<br />There are several aspects of  this book that I found unusual. First, Kelso is not some smarmy Yank  defending Mom, Old Glory, Apple Pie and the American Way against the forces  of Chaos. Rather, he's a tweedy Brit manning the walls in support of Queen,  Union Jack, Spotted Dick and what's left of the Empire. (Unfortunately  named, Spotted Dick is, like apple pie, a dessert. Steamed pudding with  currants, topped with a custard sauce. If you don't believe me, there are  recipes for it on the Web.) Second, Kelso is not of the usual hero Right  Stuff - a swashbuckling spy, or a world-weary cop, or a brilliant  physician, or a hard-charging lawyer. Rather, he's a perfectly ordinary -  almost too ordinary - bloke who happens to be an historian, whose chief  talent is a knowledge of Soviet and Russian history. (We'll soon be seeing  CPAs or convenience store clerks in Defender of the Free World roles, for  Chrissake!) Third, Kelso fails to bed the woman passing as the story's  female lead. As I recall, he doesn't even manage a kiss. Maybe it's because  she's a part-time hooker. (A little too lower class, old boy. Perhaps even  Bond would hesitate, what? And the Queen would not be amused.)<br />In any  case, the action is well paced with reasonably satisfying plot twist and  ending, and the dialogue is not inordinately inane. It also raises the very  valid question as to modern Russia's propensity for a return to Stalinism.  As Kelso observes, the Russians have no tradition of democracy, and are  quickly weary of the social debate and wrangling associated with such.  Under these circumstances, what they are likely to want is a Strongman with  a Hard Line, and any hard line will do. Quite right, I think.h.

Del is shortly  thereafter murdered, and Gabe proceeds to investigate the Fuitcake's story  in company with Margot, the dead man's niece and heir.<br />There are many  problem's with this book, not the least of which is that Gabe inspires  little sympathy, at least from me. His major strongpoint is the deep,  abiding love for his baby daughter, whose custody he shares with a bitchy  ex-wife. Beyond that, he's way too humdrum to be the hero of a 441-page  paperback. And that's another problem, the book is far too long. The reader  isn't given a clue as to the nature of the Great Conspiracy until well into  the second half, and, when the Evil Plot is fully revealed at the end, it  falls into the \\"So, what?\\" category. I mean, that's what we expect our  banks to do, don't we?<br />Margot, and Gabe's relationship with her, are two  more irritants. Margot is a perky lawyer-turned-Hollywood producer. Oh,  please, how LA! No surprise, she's cute as a button, and her love affair  with our non-hero takes a course as scripted as a class B movie. There's  one scene where Gabe introduces her to Pug, the old and cantankerous (but  with a Heart of Gold!) lawyer who had defended him on the assault rap, and  who has since becomes Gabe's mentor. The verbal interplay between the  characters at this meeting is so icky-predictable and corny that I was left  estimating how many times I'd read or viewed the same dialog in previous  books and movies. Five? Ten? Twenty?<br />The one interesting character and  Gabe's authority nemesis, Sacramento Police Lt. Spencer \\"The Shinto  Splinter\\" Shimota, has several walk-on parts as he dutifully and doggedly  tries to connect Gabe to the latest crimewave. At times, Gabe was so  insufferably annoying that I was left wishing that The Shinto Splinter  might succeed. Spencer deserves a novel of his own.<br />The ONLY reason that  I finished this clunker was to learn what comeuppance befalls the  Archvillain of the piece, Dakota Jones. In the end, even that is an  anticlimactic thud.<br />I cannot recommend this book unless you're  shipwrecked on an isolated atoll, and this is the sole diversion that  washes up onto the beach.insufferably annoying that I was left wishing that The Shinto Splinter  might succeed.

For me, Starr's admirable volume works  best during the first half, when the historical evolution of blood and  blood product therapy from the 17th century up to the end of World War II  is described. After that, it becomes repetitive of the excellent work  previously authored by Randy Shilts, \\"And the Band Played On\\". The  hepatitis and AIDS crises of the late 20th century have certainly revealed  the various international and national elements of the blood industry to be  conservative, cantankerous, shortsighted, jingoistic, sometimes lacking in  social conscience, occasionally unethical, often self-serving to the point  of greed, and with leaders of monumental egos. Sounds like any other human  group endeavor to me. What else is new? Maybe an industry that provides  wire clothes hangers might be more idealistic, but I doubt it. The bulk of  the later chapters is \\"bad news\\". But then, to the author, who is a former  newspaper reporter, the only news worth telling  would naturally be bad  news.<br />In any case, Starr has clearly done a mountain of research. I would  highly recommend this book to anyone outside of the blood industry who  wishes to understand the broad mechanics of collecting, preserving and  distributing blood and blood products. I would also recommend it to a  person such as myself, immersed in the day-to-day technology of getting  blood to the patient, who has never been exposed to the history of the art.  Personally, I don't view the book as a \\"thriller\\", though it has been so  described by other reviewers. It's a solid, informative description of an  industry in constant change. Some might say turmoil. As an example of the  latter (not mentioned by Starr), many  agencies concerned with the blood  supply are adopting a stance promoting \\"universal leukoreduction\\", i.e. the  practice of depleting cellular blood products (both Red Blood Cells and  Platelets) of white cells, or leukocytes. Contaminating leukocytes are  known to cause immune suppression, CMV virus transmission, and  refractoriness to platelet transfusions. This universal leukoreduction is  being promoted by national professional and regulatory agencies (which got  burned by the AIDS scandal) for political reasons, by the blood filter  vendors for obviously commercial reasons, and more or less by practicing  physicians in the field. There is the counter view that universal  leukoreduction will cost the patient-consumer, or his insurance company,  too much, especially since it's not been proven that all patient  populations requiring transfusion need leukoreduced blood. Thus the current  brouhaha, yet to be resolved to everyone's satisfaction. Maybe Starr can  write a second epilog.(not mentioned by Starr), many   agencies concerned with the blood  supply are adopting a stance promoting \\"universal leukoreduction\\", i.e. the  practice of depleting cellular blood products (both Red Blood Cells and  Platelets) of white cells, or leukocytes.

This volume is a collection of essays by nine \\"leading authorities\\" on unanswered, or previously unasked, questions surrounding the battle of Gettysburg. Some of the contributions were marginally interesting, inasmuch  as the actions of several of the battle's more famous, or infamous,  commanders - Chamberlain, Sickles, Ewell, Stuart -  were examined from new  perspectives. I was particularly interested in the somewhat revisionist  view of Joshua Chamberlain, an erstwhile personal hero of mine, taken by  Glenn LaFantasie. Maybe, just maybe, the savior of Little Round Top wasn't  quite the paragon of honor and integrity I thought him to be. (Oh well,  another bubble burst. At 51, I should expect such disillusionment.) A  couple more of the essays fell into the category of \\"Who Cares?\\", e.g. the  one by J. Matthew Gallman on the effect of the battle on the town of  Gettysburg itself. Yawn. Finally, a couple more were nothing more than  windy exercises by \\"experts\\" who probably like seeing their views in print  regardless of content.

By the  end of the book, he finds professional, spiritual and emotional redemption  stemming from his surprisingly brief encounter with Rachel, the elusive  missionary daughter, and a somewhat longer bout with dengue fever.

Despite the fact that 26 men died in the submarine Squalus sinking 61 years ago, at no time did I, as a reader of this narrative, feel that the 33 survivors were in acute danger. The description of events that happened  inside the boat immediately before, during, and after the sinking made it  obvious that there were indeed survivors (because who else could've  remembered such detail?), so that key element of suspense was removed  almost from the beginning. Had the author told the tale from the  perspective of the rescuers only, the book would have been more gripping,  but much shorter - and it isn't long as it is, 259 pages in hardcover. The  most glaring deficiency is the lack of any visual reinforcement. There're  no photographs of the men and rescue equipment involved, despite the fact  the rescue operation was a \\"media event\\". There's not even a diagram of the  sub's interior for the reader to get his/her bearings. While the dedication  and competence of Charles Momsen and his rescue team was unquestionably  admirable, I just wasn't inspired to cheer as the last survivor was plucked  from the deep.

A warm wind for February, laden with the hot greasy scents of frying pancakes and sausages and powdery-sweet waffles cooked on the hot plate right there by the roadside,  with the confetti sleeting down collars and cuffs and rolling in the  gutters like an idiot antidote to winter.&quot;<br />Thus the first two  sentences of a book that was instantly captivating, and remained so,  despite a story line that veered away from the promise of whimsy to grapple  with some of the darker aspects of the human condition - spousal abuse,  social prejudice, religious zealotry and intolerance, and heavy-handed  &quot;management&quot; of the aged.<br />I only wish the author had dwelt more  at length on the subjects of Anouk's Pantoufle and Vianne's talents as a  witch(?). But for these omissions, 5 stars for a thoroughly enjoyable and  satisfying book.	2000-03-18
2600845:US	53075086	R11GBQW0YNNIES	0394555082	642527170	Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A great President. An almost-great book.	During the last third of the book, I was prepared to give it only 2 stars. The author's technique of telling the story from the first-person viewpoint of a fictional acquaintance of President Reagan's did, I thought, add  unnecessarily to the length of the book, and didn't seem particularly  clever. However, the twist given to the ending on the very last page of the  Epilogue caused me to reconsider, and award 4 stars. Had there been more  hard information about Reagan's years in the White House, I would have  given 5.<br />I had the honor of shaking Mr. Reagan's hand in the late 60's  when he was Governor of California. At the time, I was a teenage stock boy  in the pharmacy of St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, CA. He was admitted  for some minor procedure, and the pharmacy staff (minus a diehard Democrat)  sent him a get well card. The Governor came down to shake hands all around  when he was discharged. The cynic would say he was simply running for  re-election. Perhaps so, but I was impressed.<br />Critics of Reagan will  point to this book as confirmation that he was but a shallow B performer  acting out the role of Governor, then President. They may well be right.  But damn, what an academy award performance it was! God bless, Mr.  President.	2000-03-10

By his own admission, he can \\"walk in the woods outside of the city where I ended up living and see beautiful  trees and huge mountains topped with spectacular glaciers\\", an experience  that only  causes him to \\"miss the world's greatest industrial swamp\\".  Thus, he  \\"began taking cross-country trips to the Meadowlands and spending  more and more time there\\".  This book is a result of Bob's preoccupation.  No, let's call it what it is - a curious obsession in need of some serious  therapy. It's not that the book is poorly written or overly boring. It's  just that it's about people, events and a place that are so excruciatingly  MUNDANE. Get a life, Bob! There was absolutely nothing in the book that  makes me want to get anywhere near the Meadowlands! Isn't that one of the  motivations, overt or subliminal, for writing a travel essay about this, or  any other, place?<br />Please say you're not planning to make a travel  documentary on the same subject!	2000-02-21

The author has written an eminently readable, thoroughly enjoyable, and well-researched book on the third day of the Gettysburg battle, July 3, 1863. An especially rewarding read if one has toured, or plans to visit,  the battlefield site. The author's unpretentious, conversational style of  writing succeeds in putting the reader on the ground occupied by both the  Confederate and Union forces before, during and after Pickett's and  Pettigrew's famous assault on Meade's Second Corps. Interspersed with humor  and down-to-earth observations concerning battlefield conditions, the  author conscientiously describes all aspects of the battle, from massing of  the assault columns and pre-assault artillery barrage to the last shots and  the flight of the surviving rebels back to the safety of their lines.  Having visited Gettysburg several years ago (my chief interest then being  Joshua Chamberlain's heroic defense of Little Round Top on the battle's  second day), this superb volume makes me want to go again.	2000-02-18

I discovered, rather, an informative but tediously boring history of the rural peasantry  of Ireland, England and France in the 18th and 19th centuries. I can only  recommend the book as a potent soporific capable of curing the most  pernicious case of insomnia. If your sleep habits provide sufficient rest,  don't bother.	2000-02-04

Unfortunatly, it is also very dry reading. Also, even at the relatively superficial level of detail with  which the war's great battles are outlined, there is a disappointing  paucity of maps. As the author describes the movements of armies, corps and  divisions here, there and everywhere relative to cities, rivers, lakes and  other topographical features, the reader is left with an incomplete picture  of the tactical situation. However, I liked the book enough to finish it,  and was left with much greater degree of knowledge about the subject than I  had when I started. A marginal &quot;thumbs up&quot;.	1999-12-31

Life is too short to have suffered through to the end when there are so many books on my \\"to read\\" list.<br />According to the author's short bio, Ms.  Storace is an accomplished essayist and poet. \\"Dinner With Persephone\\" is  her first book of prose. I think she should stay with her old job. I was  hard pressed to see any evidence that she enjoyed the experience about  which she was writing, i.e. living in Greece. She trudges from one vignette  to the next with no apparent relish. Her prose is too often interspersed  with such thoughts as: \\"The Greeks made their constellations out of myths  and immortalities, but I am not Greek, so I trace my own out of history and  mortality. I draw my imaginary line between two fireflies who have traveled  an immense distance, a firefly conqueror audible for a moment in a word it  was in his character to speak, and a temporary firefly consciousness who  recognizes it.\\" Oh, PLEASE, lighten up! I myself travel for the joy of it.  I read travel essays to either picture in my mind's eye places I will  probably never arrive at in person, or to begin to experience places to  which I have a confirmed ticket. Neither purpose was served by this  joyless, tedious book. I regret having spent the money to buy it.	1999-12-07

But even the \\"best damned\\" of anything gets tiresome after awhile. Admittedly, Ed tells a good tale of  his coming of age in Nam as a Marine sniper while learning to lead the  \\"good guys\\" of his side, and kill the \\"bad guys\\" of the other side. It's  told with the unflagging energy and Weltanschauung of a 20-year old. But  that's the problem. The book was published in 1999, presumably recently  written by the author while in his early 50's. Until the epilogue, I didn't  see any evidence of wisdom accumulated in the three decades since Nam that  might have otherwise tempered his narrative. Too bad, since Ed has been at  the top management levels of both PepsiCo and Compaq Computer Corporation.  I mean, he must have grown up just a little since the 60's, right? Ed, I'm  in my 50's too, and your book left me none the wiser from your experience.	1999-08-02

True Believers of the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin as the burial raiment of Jesus will mutter that the author, a True Believer himself, does not go far enough to propound their position on the matter. Those That  Scoff, however, will howl their ridicule and dismay that the author could  be so blinded by personal bias. Can't win, poor devil. However, as a  non-Christian who has only an academic interest that the image on the  shroud is that of Jesus or not, I found the book to be an enlightening and  thoroughly fascinating treatment of the enigmatic cloth as a historical  object. There are Mysteries for which we'll never have an answer, and I  suspect this is one of them. Best leave belief to the faith of those who  are so inclined.	1999-07-07

Emily's dry humor allows the reader to finish this appalling and heartrending account of OCD without getting too depressed over the author's bizarre behavior. One is left simply amazed that her husband stuck around  for as long as he did. Even Emily's picture on the book jacket transmits a  sense that profound psychological distress lies just underneath her quite  comely exterior. The reader can only hope the author has been permitted,  through therapy, a more serene existence.	1999-06-17

The subtitle of the book, \\"In Praise of Difficult Women\\", is misleading if it is judged by the examples of so-called \\"difficult\\" women that Ms. Wurtzel pushes forward onto her stage. Delilah (of Bible infamy) can't be  termed \\"difficult\\"; she's too obscure a reference. Sylvia Plath and Anne  Sexton weren't \\"difficult\\"; they were psychological cripples that became  casualties of life. Amy Fisher isn't \\"difficult\\"; she's just pathetic.  Hillary Clinton isn't \\"difficult\\", just annoying. Nicole Brown Simpson  wasn't \\"difficult\\", but pathetic AND irrelevant to those of us with real  lives to lead. Oh, please!  I would rather Ms. Wurtzel had chosen women  that were \\"difficult\\" because they strove mightily to be masters of their  own lives, made a significant impact on the societies they lived in, were  otherwise \\"normal\\", and died of natural causes with assured places in human  history. As an amateur student of England and all things English, two  remarkable women immediately come to mind: Eleanor of Aquitaine and  Elizabeth I. The former (and my favorite), first Queen of France then Queen  of England, confounded the lives and kingdoms of her two royal spouses, was  divorced by one and imprisoned by the other, yet managed to outlive both  with honor, possessions and identity intact. The latter, daughter of Henry  VIII and Queen of England, had no man as master during a long reign that  saw the beginnings of Britannia's rise to superpower status. I'm sure there  must have been (and are now) women of other nationalities and cultures that  Ms. Wurtzel could have chosen rather than the misfits and/or outright  losers that she did. (In all due fairness to Hillary Clinton, she doesn't  fit into either category quite yet. However, she's got a long way to go  before she's anything other than a footnote to history and Slick  Willy.)<br />Also, the author didn't always seem quite convinced that her  ideal, feminist world could, in fact, be realized. At several points in the  narrative, she'd appeared almost willing to regress into a more traditional  role simply because it would take too much of her life's energy to do  otherwise. This backsliding rendered her message ambiguous, and the point  she was trying to make with this book exceedingly murky. Of course, being a  man, I probably just don't, and can't, understand.<br />With all this said,  however, and despite Mr. Wurtzel's style that was too often rambling and  directionless, I very much enjoyed her occasional nuggets of wisdom and  insight, especially in those chapters that had Hillary and Nicole as the  main players. After all, I finished the book, and that makes it at least a  \\"6\\" on a scale of 10. Life is too short, with too many books to read, for  anything less.tive, she'd appeared almost willing to regress into a more traditional  role simply because it would take too much of her life's energy to do  otherwise.

Considering the inglorious end to  the reign of his son, Edward II, an epilog chapter to Edward I's biography  would have been welcome, or at least more attention paid to the  relationship between the latter and his heir.	1999-04-06

Within the pages of Doris Goodwin's affectionate, poignant, and nostalgic  memoir of growing up in the 50's, the notion that &quot;you can never go  back again&quot; is proved false. Though I'm 6 years younger than the  author, and was a childhood resident of the West Coast rather than the  East, her memories transported me back to a time when life was as carefree  and golden as it would ever be. If only we'd known. Her Fantasy Theater was  my Bay Theater, her St. Agnes my Corpus Christi, her Bryn Mawr Meat Market  my Slutzky's, her Dugan's Bakery man my Helm's truck, and her Dodger heroes  Robinson, Campanella, Snyder, Hodges, Reese and Roe my Koufax, Drysdale,  Howard, Wills, Fairly and Davis. Forty years have since past, and life has  been , and is, very good. However, the Bay Theater is closed, Big D is  dead, the Helm's Building is a shopping mall, and Corpus Christi has lost  its relevance. I'm weary of the media's assault on my senses with endless  accounts of drive-by shootings, excesses of political correctness,  presidential peccadilloes, OJ and his ilk, and the deeds of strident,  ofttimes violent, true believers of every sort.<br />Thank you, Doris, for  taking me &quot;home&quot; again.	1998-09-10

This is a book I kept reading... and reading ... and reading, hoping for an ending clever enough to justify the effort I was making. Alas, the pay-off never came. Along the way, we meet the \\"hero\\" of the story, Paul Osborn, a Southern California physician adrift in Europe in search of his father's killers, who is so unsympathetic a character that I found myself wishing he would get knocked off by the bad guys just because he was such a total jerk. A more interesting character is the homicide detective, McVey, who switches from being Osborn's nemesis to ally over the course of the plot - a plot so totally implausible as to be almost a parody of this genre of thriller. The villain of the piece, a sinister, resurgent Nazi organization of true believers left over from the Third Reich is so ridiculously omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient that the reader is left amazed at the ease of its anticlimactic collapse. I cannot recommend this book unless you're stuck on a long plane flight with nothing else to read but the emergency instruction card - as I was.	1997-08-14
