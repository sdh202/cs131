Drawing on the wisdom of the saints, particularly St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa as well as his own learning, he gives a simple rule for discerning whether your vision is true or whether to believe in an aparition you may have heard of. He also discusses the Course in Miracles and how destructive it was to the woman who wrote it and how it is still dangerous today.  <br /> <br />This is a deep subject obviously, but Father Groeschel writes in such a down to earth way that you don't need to be a theologian or a mystic in order to digest this excellent book.	2005-09-06

The heroine takes a mountain of emotional abuse from the angry hero and Alexandra Sellers is such a good writer that probably for most  of her readers she made the abuse palatable. Between the twisted, strange relationship and the lavish descriptions of the Canadian city where the heroine restarts her life this was a memorable book. I never wanted to read it again and I certainly wouldn't want any kid of mine reading it but I never forgot it. It's an ugly story with beautiful writing.	2005-08-28

The message of this book is pretty simple and straightforward. Don't freak out. Yes, the scandals have been heartbreaking and yes these last couple of years have been one shock after another but don't let it kill your faith or your reasoning ability. The church has, Father Groeschel points out, suffered scandals before and came back stronger from them. Stupid, evil, filthy things have happened and stupid, callow people stood by and did nothing but there is hope.  <br /> <br />The book is very honest, and calls for reform as loudly and as clearly as can be. And the reform it calls for isn't just for the clergy, the book has some stern words for the laity as well.  <br /> <br />From Scandal to Hope is relief to the grieving and confused and a rebuke to those who are frankly enjoying the scandal for their own reasons.  It's a tiny book but packs a wallop.	2005-08-23

We learned a few basic prayers and had a nodding acquaintance with the sacraments but most of us spent relgion class making burlap banners and collages. I had only the vaugest notion of who Padre Pio was until I was grown and began reading about the Faith on my own.  <br /> <br />This book is a perfect little companion for your holy hour before the Blessed Sacrament. Each chapter is broken up into short but powerful meditations, excepts from St. Pio's life and ends with a short prayer. It's a really beautiful book.	2005-08-23

Seventeen Independent Priests Tell Why They Celebrate the Latin Mass	Books	4	27	28	N	N	take a look	At my parish one of the easiest ways to tell a joke is to mention the traditionalist/Tridentine movement. Within minutes everyone listening will jump in to call the Traditionalists names and to mock them. I never really thought about it before but after reading Priest Where is Thy Mass, Mass Where is Thy Priest, I find myself wondering why there is so much hostility towards them.<br /><br />Each one of these priests has a very sad story to tell. They preferred for various reasons to say the traditional mass instead of the Novus Ordo and they all got smacked down for it.<br /><br />This is strange when you stop to consider that some of our bishops have ignored or covered up some pretty foul behavior  in the past and yet these 17 men were handled with such scorn and even outright cruelty. If this is how traditionalists were usually treated in the 70s, 80s and 90s then it's no wonder why some are bitter about the experience.<br /><br />The book makes for painful reading. Some of the priests here rebounded with humor, others are obviously angry and disgusted. All of them seemed sad and still a little shocked at how things have turned out. If you've ever cracked a joke about the traditionalists or was the least bit curious about them read this book and try to do it with an open mind. I'm glad I did.	2005-08-23

He very gently but firmly shows some of the mistakes Barbet made but doesn't  hesitate to give him credit for the things he was right about.  Zugibe is a curious man and he investigated and discects every possible theory about Christ's death on the cross. The book is not for the faint of heart, as the earlier reivewer notes but it is an amazing scientific and yet mystical look into the horrifying suffering that a crucified man would have suffered. The chapters on the scourging and the crowing with thorns are particularly moving. I actually cried and there were times when I had to put the book down becuase it is incredibly touching. I expected the book to be cold and dry but Zugibe is a pretty good writer. He's produced a masterwork. There is not a finer book on the physical aspects of the crucifixion in print.	2005-08-22

The cottages are, with two known exceptions, tidy. The villagers are happy and like things just the way they are. Lord and Lady Lacklander are respected and admired. Then, suddenly after the death of the old lord things get messy. It turns out that Swevenings may look like heaven but is actually hiding a very painful and ugly secret, one that the old lord wanted exposed and one that costs his best friend his life.  <br /> <br />You have the sensible nurse, the village drunk, the not crazy at all eccentric, the grande dame, the cloying young lovers and of course the bleached blonde outsider. Into this mix comes our handsome detective. He's not a flashy genius or a talented amateur.  He's a cop, albeit one with a distinguished family background. His humor is gentle, his habits are unremarkable. He just keeps plugging away until he solves this case becuase it's his job and becuase the crime offends his sense of decency.  <br /> <br />Scales of Justice is classic example of the cozy msystery and it pretty much unrolls the way you'd expect it to. By the end of the book things have been set right and life in Swevenings goes back to the bland sweetness of before. It's a pleasant way to spend a few hours.	2005-08-22

This should be a happy occasion and an easy acting job but something is not right. The last man to be engaged to the bride died a little too suddenly and there are quiet fears that something might happen to the new groom. There are troubling whispers and old rumors that won't stay dead and Joliffe, who's no prude is shocked to discover despite a respectable veneer there seems to be a sexual carnival going on at the estate. Things rapidly turn ugly and it takes all of Joliffe's wits to solve a particularly gruesome mystery. It's a very satisfying mystery and the ending is a shocker.  <br /> <br />	2005-08-04

Robin Goldsby tells the story of how she fell into a career that's gone on for 30+ years. Luckily for her Robin was a terrible teenaged waitress and was able to put her piano playing to use instead.  <br /> <br />Like a waitress, the hotel or lounge piano player sees a lot of real life. People either treat the piano player like a machine or they impose too much. Her adventueres from Pittsburgh to New York to Haiti and Europe are quite entertaining. This isn't a terribly deep or complicated book but that's okay. It's light, airy and nice--- like the background music at your favorite restaurant.	2005-08-04

Romances are not my thing but I made an exception for the Remarkable Miss Frankenstien and I'm glad I did.  <br /> <br />Claire Frankenstein is a real doll. She's a cute, spunky character. She's inteligent, fearless and is determined to make her mark in the scientific world. Her beloved uncle, Victor Frankenstein and her adopted cousin Frederick are already famous and she wants to do something just as spectacular. She decides to captures a vampire. While keeping her best friend, Jane Van Helsing of THE Van Helsing family apprised of her plan she goes after a vamps and werewolves and  finds a very attractive man.  <br /> <br />The hero is not a sterotypical brooding rake and he's not one of those sweet/savage brutes either. Ian is a delightful, brave and secretive (with good reason) man who finds Claire bewildering and appealing at the same time.  <br /> <br />The romance is lovely, the humor is very clever, the gowns and homes are lovingly described. The sex was a bit on the unrealistic side but you can easily skip over those short scenes. This is one part Jane Austin, one part Dracula, and one part gothic which makes a fine little book. There's just got to be a sequel. How about something involving Asher and Jane?	2005-07-19

Anakin has never been more emotionally stable. He's a general,  he's Palpatines pet and Padme's husband. He and Obi Wan have finally formed a smooth partnership. Except for one ugly incident it looks like Anakin is on his way to becoming a great Jedi knight. But of course we all know how this is going to turn out.  <br /> <br />The dark side has fallen over the republic. Yoda knows in his heart that the situation is hopeless. The only thing the Jedi can do now is see it the end.  <br /> <br />The side characters were done well. Dooku is presented in a interesting light. He's brilliant, he's lethal and considers himself to be far superior to Maul and Grievous. He seems to be wavering between a sentimental longing for Jedi acceptance and his need to be a ruler. Grievous is described in an almost sympathetic way. He is a servant of the Sith, he's a monster but not by choice and he's probably meant to be a forshadowing of Darth Vader.  <br /> <br />Finally, the senators and citizens are Coruscant are described. They're mostly selfish, lazy and such cowards that you wish the Jedi would all just decide that these people aren't worth fighting for. The book is a dazzling combination of intense action scenes and deeply emotional little scenes that rush without lagging to the end which is the opening act of Revenge of the Sith.  <br /> <br />The book is pretty darn good. Check it out.  <br />	2005-07-19
171913:US	52223435	R33665UB7FVTWY	0345428811	938075605	Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Great for filling in the movie gaps	When I first started reading Attack of the Clones I thought I'd accidentally picked up the young adult version. The first 30 pages are written very simply. Then R.A. Salvatore's own writing style seemed to kick in and the book takes off.     I won't get into the plot because a SW fan already knows it. The strength of this book is the way it fills in the background details that were left out of the movie. It was good to see Shmi Skywalker's life with Clieg and to know that she really was happy before the Sandpeople capture her.     You also get to see that Obi Wan isn't just stern with Anakin he's actually quite worried about the kid and his desire to get back to Anakin and have a talk with him never leaves his mind throughout his adventures. Obi Wan is still a young man himself and it's clear he has no idea of what to do with a Padawan who is more powerful and yet more fragile than any other Jedi learner.     Mace Windu, surprisingly seems much more mellow concerning Anakin than he did in the movie. When Obi Wan tells him that he thinks Anakin is in over his head with Padme Master Windu does not flip out and seems to not take it seriously at all. Mace is intense in the book but the only one really disturbed by Anakin in this episode in Obi Wan.     The relationship betwenn Jango Fett and his son is beautifully shown.  Even though Jango is doing the wrong thing with his son(raising him to be a cold blooded killer)he really loves the boy and you wish that Jango had just taken his money and quit while he had the chance.     The book spends a good deal of time delving into the motivations behind Anakin and Padme's relationship. I was surprised at how strongly the book hints that the pairing isn't that healthy or viable. After reading the scenes with Padme's family on Naboo it's obvious that she's tired. She wants romance, a home and a family. She's doing  her duty but for the first time she's thinking about life outside of politics. Anakin is so emotionally needy and has idolized her from the time he was a kid. In his eyes she's like a movie star and saint wrapped into one. In the face of such powerful devotion she's overwhelmed. The romantic scenses could've been called The Siege of Amidala.   The book shows a relationship that's part crush and part physical which is great for a summer fling but not so promising for a marriage.     Other than the strangely slow start, and a bit of weakness when describing the fight scenes I was very happy with the Attack of the Clones novel.	2005-07-10

Being Dead is No Excuse : The Official Southern Ladies Guide to Hosting the Perfect Funeral isn't really a fully Southern guide. It's how they do things in MS, AR, and LA. Some of the  dishes  in the book have never been heard of outside of the Delta  but it's terrific food all the same.  <br /> <br />You will see the difference between Methodists and Episcopalian funeral food, you'll finally divine the secret to good tomato aspic and you'll cringe at the bad memories of everytime you had to sit through a solo of On Eagles Wings. That song is on the list of music that should never be played at a tasteful Southern funeral.  <br /> <br />I laughed and snorted in a most unladylike fashion while reading the book and I plan to make the Sad Cake and the brocoli casserole ASAP. My only nit pick is this: the book ends too abruptly. Just when you are catching your breath from the giggles it's over. There should have been an afterward chapter or note tot he reader or something. Otherwise it's just darling.  <br />	2005-06-25

He's kind of a detective, in that with his second sight like gift he can find anything. He lives and works in the Nightside. The Nightside is essentially the Twilight Zone, nightmareland and Bogeymanville mixed into one really rough place. Demons, ghosts, vampires, wizards and other things too terrible to name are all real and live in the Nightside.  <br /> <br /> The book starts out strong. John is hired by Lady Luck to find out the origin of the Nightside. It has something to do with his long lost mother. A lot of people are unhappy about John's assignment and a lot of people and things are scared of John because they suspect that he takes after his mother, who was so powerful and frightening that nobody wants to even say her name.  <br /> <br />John picks up some companions for this job. One is known as Sinner, a guy who was kicked out of hell but refused entry into heaven. Sinner's girlfriend is a demon. Madman is another companion. He's like Ray Miland's character from the movie \\"The Man with the X-ray Eyes.\\" Madman has seen more than mortals were meant to see and is usually insane as a result. He's also able to turn people into things just by looking at them.  <br /> <br />The book starts out strong. The writing is incredibly clever and is full of little homages to other books and legends. But it doesn't last. The author, Simon Green did a great job of building up the ominousness of John's mother--- she's built into the ultimate Big Bad but when she does show up it's a let down. I read that chapter and thought 'That's it?' <br /> <br />John's mother isn't all that scary and his great problem as a result of her appearance doesn't seem like all that either. <br /> <br />The book starts out with a bang and ends with a whimper.	2005-06-22

It begins with the artists in the attic. A talented group of young people worked at Skywalker ranch to put George Lucas's visions to paper. Boga, the lizard, Alderaan and Mustafar were on Lucas's mind very early on and the imagination of the artists was put to the test. Next come the actors. The reader is already aquainted with McGregor, Portman and Christensen and so Jonathan Rinzler is free to write about the other cast and crew members and their impressions and various journies to Star Wars. The artist who did the stunning toasty Anakin makeup had actually been dreaming about this job since he was a teenager. Some of the stunt men and sword masters had pasts that were so intriguing that I would've loved to have read more. <br /> <br />The details of how hard Samuel L. Jackson (who looks like he had a ball) had to work to get that duel with Palpatine on film is very interesting as is the section of working with Christopher Lee.  Finally, the book discusses the part that Lucas clearly loves the most: going back to the \\"lab\\" and adding the special effects, cutting and editing and tinkering with the film.  <br /> <br />There are some wonderful photos in the book. In one Lucas is talking to two Jedis. They look real. He looks like a photoshop add in. The pictures of the sets and how certain things were done were fascinating. And in the middle of this huge production real life is going on. Lucas and McCallum have families who float in and out. The set nurse and the cafeteria workers play an important role and everyone knows that the set carpenters are geniuses. <br /> <br />If you specialize in Star Wars books your collection won't be complete without this one.	2005-06-19

You won't want to put it down. I read through lunch, dinner and stayed up late to finish it.  <br /> <br />The mystery is complex. The characters are very good. Father John Baptist is calm amidst the whirlwind, whip smart and doesn't mind offending people if it means hiding the truth. His Watson, Martin the gardner, altar server, assistant cook, driver and leg man (despite a nasty case of arthritis) is loud mouthed, cranky as as wolverine and devoted to Father Sherlock. He's also a smart guy in his own right. The other characters, the hard drinking, party loving Knights of the Tumblar function as Father Baptist's Baker Street Irregulars. The cops are nicely written and so are the colorful, fiesty and sometimes crazy group of folks who make up Father Baptist's parish.  <br /> <br />The villains are well done too and their particular vices were timely. About ten years ago I would've thought there was no way such people could exist in their positions. Today, nothing shocks me.  <br /> <br />Endless Knot is a mystery in the Arthur Conan Doyle/Agatha Christie mold but it ends with a bittersweet note. The killer is caught but not without cost to the detectives. I'm off to find the next book in the series.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-11

It's much better than that. Matthew Bunson touches on the days before JPII died and the outpouring of grief and love that occurred after his death. He gives a straightforward peek into the conclave proccess and finally introduces the reader to Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict 16.  <br /> <br />You will find a quick run down of Joseph Ratzinger's life and get an idea of just how much John Paul the II respected and relied on Benedict 16. If you didn't know who Cardinal Ratzinger was before or if you got your image of him from the knee jerk reactions of the media We Have a Pope is a very good place for the average soul in the back pews to start getting an idea of who the new Holy Father is.	2005-06-06

This is the story of the Spanish princess Katherine of Aragon and it's beautiful, tragic and stirring. Katherine was the daughter of Queen Isabella of Spain. Isabella was a bold, powerful and capable ruler and there was no reason in Katherine's experience why she or a daughter of hers couldn't be the same way. And then she goes to England.  <br /> <br />As we all know Katherine's marriage to Prince Arthur lasted for one hot minute. The gentle, sickly boy dies leaving her in political limbo. It was an unpleasant time filled with worry but Katherine bravely gets through it and has a fairy tale ending. Henry, Arthur's younger brother marries her. Plaidy is particularly good at describing Henry. He goes from being a wonderful/horrible boy to a beautiful, dangerously sexy and impulsive young man. He's a romantic dream and all he wants is Katherine. <br /> <br />And then a cloud appears. Katherine gets pregnant but her son dies. And then other babies are lost. In the end only her daughter Mary survives. Plaidy deftly shows Henry begining to change. He's still beautiful, still a romantic dream but he wants a son and he begins to stray. Some of the most touching passages in the whole series describe how Katherine toughs this period out.  <br /> <br />And then comes the final act. Henry turns mean and dangerous. Katherine is divorced, cast aside, friends are killed, her child is taken from her. Her faith, her dignity and her entire world is attacked and still she stands.  The book ends with delicate touch. Katherine hasn't quite lost and Anne Boleyn, who is shown only from a distance in this series hasn't quite won.  <br /> <br />Jean Plaidy was a fabulous writer and the Katherine of Aragon series was one of the top five greatest things she ever wrote.	2005-06-05

Janice Bennett does a nice job explaining what a sudarium was, why the Israelites used it in cases where the dead person had been disfigured and why this particular sudarium is so important.  <br /> <br />The best part of the book is on ancient Jewish burial customs because it helps explain so much about the burial of Jesus and what came after. Bennett also explains how the Sudariam got to Spain. If you've read about the Shroud of Turin this is a must have companion book.	2005-06-05

It tells roughly day by day the story of how George Lucas and his merry bad of special effects wizards made the movie. It also breaks out into detailed sections on particular days. You get to see how 2 year old Jedi's are trained, how the actress playing Naboo's queen was cast and how the actor playing Jango Fett was discovered.  <br /> <br />This is a very entertaining book and if you're a Star Wars fan that wants to know how it was all done you'll want this for your collection.	2005-06-05

It flourished all over the world and continues to this day)and talks about the high and low points of black education.  <br /> <br />This a brilliant book that sugar coats nothing.	2005-05-22

This has to be the greatest book Scott Hahn's ever written. In very simple language he explains why the Mass is not just a worship service.  <br /> <br />If you have gotten into the habit of treating Sunday Mass like a chore or if you're easily distracted by the lousy music, or a bad homily or a screaming baby then this is truly shattering book. Hahn forcefully and beautifully explains that none of that stuff matters because the King of Kings is present at Mass and if He's there so is Heaven. I was filled with awe and joy reading this book. It's great.	2005-05-21

The life of Pat Taylor is living proof of this.     If someone  had steped forward to straighten Pat out as a child by preaching modesty, and self control and had given her a good spanking when she deserved it things might have been different.    Ann Rule tells a horrifying story of how one woman's jealousy, need for constant attention and greediness ruined the lives of everyone around her. Even people, such as Tom's parents who clearly didn't want to be involved with her were destroyed. It's amazing how long this woman went unchecked.    Now, as for the book itself it has some typical Ann Rule flaws: She tends to idealize her favorite sources to the point where it's ridiculous. Two sources are treated as complete victims who had no responsibility for their actions or failed marriages and I found that extremely annoying. Rule also has a thing about fat people and treats  fat like it's a mark of Cain.  She also indulges in purple prose. Her description of Zebulon sounds like a high school essayist trying to write like Faulkner. Other than these common Rule quirks the book is fascinating.	2005-05-08

Davies was not a lovely stylist when it came to writing but that's okay. This book is a history lesson not poetry.  Athanasius found himself standing alone in the face of the Arian heresy which was supported by most of the Eastern bishops, and the emperor. Athanasius stood fearless and unapologetic when it was not safe or convenient to do so. He suffered five exiles and numerous attempts on his life. He kept on talking, writing and outlasted his enemies. Today 90% of the Christians world couldn't even tell you what Arianism was.<br /><br /> Overall, the book is fine and will leave the reader awed by what a mighty man of God St. Athanasius was.	2005-05-03

Either you love, love, love it and consider it to be the greatest book since the Bible or you hated it. I, alas, belong to the second group. I didn't want to hate it but there's so little substance here, it's shocking.  <br /> <br />The book is dull, repetitive, and comes off like a slick piece of marketing. It also seems to have been written for people possesing only 8th grade reading skills. I resented being constantly urged in every other chapter to read (buy) Rick Warren's other books. Purpose Driven Life looks impressive at first glance but when you read it, it's just another self help book. Whether it sticks around on the Christian market as a perpetual favorite or whether it becomes the new Prayer of Jabez (a fad) remains to be seen but it certainly doesn't live up to the hype.	2005-04-30

Josiah Bede is a wonderful character. He's a quiet, introspective man who'd really like to go be a gentleman farmer but murder and mayhem keeps getting in the way.   <br /> <br />In this book Josiah is asked to come to Washington and expose a possible conspiracy. President Harrison has died but did the old man really expire due to overwork and cold or was he given a push down Eternity Road? If the president was assasinated who did it and what will happen to the country?  <br /> <br />In the middle of this tense situation Josiah finds out that his ex girlfriend's new husband has vanished. Will he have a second chance with his sweetheart or did she have somehthing to do with the disappearance? On top of this someone is menacing Randolph and Louisa, Josiah's free black neighbors.  <br /> <br />This book is small but the large plot is handled very well. I really liked the way Clyde Linsley resisted the urge to turn Josiah Bede into a modern day man in fancy dress. He also manages to give the reader a look into Early America without bogging the story down or sugar coating the past. Although the North had no slavery it wasn't Heaven. Randolph and Louisa face quite a bit of unpleasantness and Linsley doesn't gloss over the rotten hand that was dealt to the Indians either. <br /> <br />The book has excellent writing. Excellent characterization, (Randolph is a particularly well done character) an interesting plot and a lovavble hero all make up a terrific book. I'll be looking for more Josiah Bede mysteries.	2005-04-30

You can spend hours pouring over these books. The quality of the paper, design and pictures are excellent.

If you don't want to know certain things before going to see ROTS wait until then to actually look at the new book.

In Some Writers Deserve to Starve Elaura Niles presents a number of hard truths that your writing teacher probably never mentioned. Do you never bother to go to writing conferences? Do you never look at Publishers Weekly? Were you shocked when the editor you've been pursuing for months signed a book deal with someone who is the son or daughter of one of their colleagues? Did you haul your 500 page, coffee stained manuscript to another author's signing and expected them to read it? If you can answer \\"yes\\" to any or all of these questions then you're a crack pot and you are not going to make it.  <br /> <br />Publishing is a tough business and Ms. Niles does a fine job in showing that to aspiring writers. My only complaint is the design of the book. It's supposed to look like old yellowed newspapers which is ugly and hard to read. Other than that the book is great. Before you shell out a pile of money on classes or editing read this and be honest with yourself.	2005-04-09

A high court official with an complex sexual past and a slew of enimies is dead. The old man was beaten to death and no-one, not his wife who was sleeping next door, his half witted concubine or his handsome houseguest will admit to knowing anything about it. Sano finds himself attempting to deal with the crime while carefully walking a thin line between two opposing factions and the weaked willed Shogun. If he finds the murderer it may ruin his career and life. If he doesn't the country may be plunged into a war. Only his samuarai code can offer him any comfort. <br /> <br />Sano's wife Reiko is also back and her character is much improved. She's no longer the annoying brat that she used to be and has become a real help to her husband's work rather than the added headache she once was.  <br /> <br />Other reviewers have mentioned the sex in this novel. It is very graphic and on occasion, revolting. If that bothers you, be prepared to either skip whole sections or skip the book. This is not a Harlequinn romance and it isn't Nancy Drew or a cozy Agatha Christie.  <br /> <br />One thing that Rowland does very well is to get into the  heads of widely different characters. The villainess does terrible things but is really a victim herself. The villain is a fascinating, twisted character who does disgusting and vicious things and almost convinces himself and the reader that he has no other choice. And of course, Sano and Reiko's relationship continues to be interesting. <br /> <br />I don't know if I'll continue with this series but this was a pretty good mystery and it has a totally unexpected ending.	2005-04-08

But when Jimmy Carter's four years were finally up even they were releived. The traditional view of Carter is that he was/is a good man who was in over his head but meant well. This book puts an entirely different spin on Jimmy.  Steven Hayward alleges and pretty much wins his argument that Jimmy is less of a fool than we thought. His decision to meddle in the affairs of every president to come after him shows a man who has a pretty good idea of what he's doing and has a petty sourness that will surprise a lot of people. <br /> <br />It's an entertaining, shocking and convincing book.	2005-03-27

Arrogance can make you make stupid mistakes. Falling in love with a story can be a disaster. Ruling a newsroom or the reporting staff with fear can lead to trouble andrelying on too many anonymous sources and accepting copies of documents are also iditotic.  <br /> <br />Walker talks about Janet Cook, who won a Pulitzer for a fake story, Jack Kelly who told spectacular tall tales and finally Jayson Blair who could've been stopped long before his last act of plagarism. Finally, he gets back to Dan Rather and serves him up like a Christmas ham.  <br /> <br />Mike Walker comes from the tabloids but the Media elite would be well advised to swallow some pride and take his advice.	2005-03-05

I mean it. Big Year is full of laughs, twists and yes, some touching moments. I love bird watching  and road trips but the guys in Big Year are hard core competitors who operate on an entirely different plain than the novices.     The book is so well written that you can almost see yourself sitting in the backseat of Sandy Komito's Skuamobile as he prowls down the highway looking for birds. In fact, it's so vivid that Big Year would actually make a darn good movie. While reading it I kept imagining James Cagney or Oscar Levant as Komito, Gregory Peck or Walter Pigeon as Al Levantin and a very young Jimmy Stewart as Greg Miller, the wonderful optimist who decides to do a Big Year on the cheap.     The things these guys encounter while pursuing their passion such as  mountain lions, cowboys with potbellied pigs, the horrors of economy flight, crocodiles, frozen graves, and icy cold outhouses are the stuff of adventure novels with a good sized dollop of comedy thrown in.     The Big year is fascinating, fun, and daydream inducing. I and most of the readers of the book will probably never get closer to a Big Year than vicariously through the book but after reading it I have started thinking that maybe, just maybe I could survive a one county Big Day.  I loved the book and even my non nature loving friends found themselves laughing out loud when I read sections of it to them.	2005-02-25

Lucky me. The heroine is very well written. She's not dumb, or pitiful and she actually grows up and discovers that having isn't always as satisfying as wanting. The villainess of the book, Pepper is suitably nasty and the New York scenes are all mostly funny. I had two small nit picks though. Spence, the love interest falls flat when he finally makes his adult appearance and the the apparently prerequisite strained mother/daughter relationship thing has been done to death. Just once in a chic lit book I'd like to see a heroine who has a reasonably healthy relationship with her parents.  <br /> <br />Anyway, the book is a very amusing way to spend a few hours.	2005-02-25

We've all heard of Jayson Blair but Hard News shows that he was a timebomb from the very begining not only becuase of his own problems but because of the vile atmosphere at the NYT.     Most of the book centers on Howell Raines and it slowly but thoroughly explains what Mnookin thinks went wrong.  Raines may have been right--the NYT had been resting on its laurels but the way he went about shaking up the old Gray Lady turned the staff against him and by the time Jayson Blair imploded blood was in the water.      This isn't a thrilling book and it's occasionally long winded but when the author finally gets to the point it's worth the wait.	2005-02-19

It not only satisfied my trivia yen but it actually gives the reader a pretty good biographical portrait of some of the more interesting presidents.  <br /> <br />Lincoln was probably the most tragic president but did you know that he once offered to use cow dung in a duel? Did you know that his wife Mary went wild if another woman ever got too close to Abe? Did you know that he loved Macbeth and idolized George Washington?  <br /> <br />Franklin Pierce has to be one of the top five most tragic figures in White House history. In one day he lost his young son, his wife's love and ended up on the road to alcoholism and a presidentcy that disappointed everyone. <br /> <br />Herbert Hoover was another sad figure. On paper his administration should have been an unflashy but dignified success. Despite his experience, intelligence and stamina he got hit with the Depression and was unfairly blamed for it.  <br />  <br />And don't forget Woodrow Wilson. He's often presented as a plaster saint but ole Woodrow was far from that. He was loved by the ladies, made up obscene limericks and was a rip roaring, shameless racist. <br /> <br />The president who comes \\"alive\\" the most on these pages is Theodore Roosevelt. What a man! Cowboy, naturalist, cop, adventurer, statesmen, wit, and force of nature. After reading this book of trivia I decided to go find a good biography of TR.	2005-02-19

Perhaps Rita Mae Brown was too because the mystery part of the story seemed phoned in for this book and the last two that preceded it.     And then Brown did something a little different with Whisker of Evil that might restore the freshness to the series. She takes away some of the idealism from Crozet. To tell the truth the dear little town isn't that nice a place. It makes St. Mary Mead look like Disneyland. You're more likely to get killed there than any place else in fictional Virginia and being acquainted with Harry is like wearing a red shirt on a classic Star Trek episiode(you know the old joke: Kirk, Spock and  Crewman Jones beam down to a newly discovered planet. Guess who gets killed in the first five minutes?).    She also takes Harry and gives her a bit of a rest. The people who really solve this case are the ones you'd least likely expect including one person whom you aren't supposed to like.     The best thing in the book is how she finally shakes Harry up  and gets her out of the post office and hopefully into what may turn out to be a mature relationship with her ex. If this series is going to go on Harry has got to grow up.    Brown also gives Fair something to do except stand around waiting for Harry to forgive him. Four years of martyrdom was getting to be unbearable.     There are some familiar flaws in the book. I figured who the killer was way too early. Brown doesn't even try to give you a red herring. I would have preferred to see some personal growth in the characters. None of these people ever change. Must Boom Boom always be the high class tramp? When is Harry ever going to grow up? Is there one person in this town with strong convictions about faith or love?     As for the book's strong points they're obvious. It's all about the animals. Mrs. Murphy, Tucker, Pewter and their friends are wise and charming. The beauty of Crozet's countryside and its past are almost characters in themselves. Still it's obvious that this series has gotten a little stale. Hopefully the seeds of change were sown int this book. I'll give the next one a shot.	2005-02-09

I can't say that he gives a good reason to do that. The worst thing he and the Anna Wintour haters he interviewed can come up with is that she's terribly driven. Well gosh! Walk into the executive offices of any successful company you'll find driven people. Super achievers are not like the rest of us.  <br /> <br />The book tries to make Anna Wintour into Cruella DeVille mixed with the Wicked Witch of the West but you know what? Everyone of her alleged personality traits would  be celebrated if she were a man.  <br /> <br />The book says over and over again that Wintour is a cold and rude person with a bullying streak(Rudeness in New York? Who'da thunk it?)and I don't doubt that she is, but is that so shocking?You are not going to find a Shirely Temple clone in the upper levels of corporate Manhattan.  <br /> <br />The book says that she works extremely hard and expects her subordinates to work just as hard. About a million bosses in this country alone expect the same thing. <br /> <br />The book itself is too long. Anna's childhood is studied in minute and boring detail. Her teen years were interesting but did we really have to read about just about EVERY guy she dated way back in the 60s? One more very, very annoying little quirk the book has is the need to mention Martha Stewart in what felt like every other chapter. Jerry Oppenheimer's last book was on Stewart and he keeps harping on it.  <br /> <br />  <br />Al in all, this is an unsatisfactory book. I didn't end up hating Wintour and although I wouldn't want to work for the woman, I actually found a lot to admire.  <br />	2005-02-06

Let's face it. Grammar is not a subject one usually associates with humor.  <br /> <br />Lynne Truss looks at the past laws of puncuation, the present sloppy day, and ponders on where we're going. She also, to my delight shows that the old trick of just putting the comma wherever one would naturally pause if speaking out loud isn't such a dumb idea and actually was what the comma was invented for.  <br /> <br />She admits that some things can't be nailed down and are a matter of taste. Some people like the Oxford comma and some don't. Some people love the semi colon and some of us will simply re-work the darn sentence in order to avoid bothering with it. I've happily ignored the semi colon for years and thanks to Eats Shoots and Leaves I can feel justified about it.  <br />And finally, she puts an end to the its/it's conundrum once and for all.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed it.  <br />	2005-01-30

He Knew He Was Right is partially Othello set in Victorian London. Louis is insanely jealous and drives his wife to misery. The lady is innocent but thanks to gossip and a Iago figure Louis can't see reason. That's the main story  but since this is Trollope there a host of deligtful side characters all bursting with life and stories of their own. I loved this book.	2005-01-10

At first glance his book looks good and if you randomly pick diffrent chapters to peep at it \\"sounds\\" good BUT unless you see God as a sugar daddy or an ATM this aint the book for you. <br /> <br />The book is sweet, funny and when he talks about his love for his family it's really touching but the basic idea--that by simply speaking the belief that God is going to give you a goodie such as a big house, a better job, more money or a better parking space ---  you can coax God into giving you what you want. What if what you want is wrong? The book doesn't delve into that.  <br /> <br />The book rejects sickness and suffering as being natural parts of life and seems to be saying that if you just say the right words and beleive them all your problems will go away. It also seems to say that if you die of an illness it's because your faith wasn't strong enough.  <br /> <br />Whoah!  <br /> <br />I guess all the early martyrs and suffering Christians around the world today didn't say the right words. Is the theme of this book Christianity or magic?  <br /> <br />I'm going to tread lightly here because hey; I'm no theologian but I don't recall Jesus saying to his apostles \\"Dudes, say the magic words and my Dad is going to give y'all chariots and palaces.\\"  <br /> <br />As delightful as the book is and although it does have some worthy nuggets of wisdom on the subject of self esteem the overall idea of God as an ATM was just too much for me. There were several times when while reading the book I had to put it down becuase it was just that distrubing. Unless you are already mature in your faith you might be better off reading Dale Carnegie or Norman Vincnet Peale.	2005-01-09

Of course since he's Bond even his more routine stuff is thrilling reading. First out is Octopussy which has nothing to do with the horrible Roger More movie. This story was really about a retired English major who once had a fine career in military inteligence. At the end of the war the major makes a terrible decision and years later in his middle age a man named Bond shows up at his Jamaican home and makes him pay for it. This story is very well written and shows that Ian Flemming had a real knack for characterization.  <br /> <br />Property of a Lady shows Bond on a pleasant but serious assignment. For a change he never has to leave London or even break a sweat but he manages to expose one high ranking Russian spy and wryly observes a low level double agent playing the spy game badly.  <br /> <br />Living Daylights in my favorite of the stories. Bond has been ordred to Germany to take out a sniper so an agent can escape to the West. This is not a nice job and Bond spends a surprising amount of time considering his distaste about the job. The little details about Bond's preparations, his school marmish old contact, the velvet snipers uniform and walking and eating around Germany are all fascinating. And in the end Bond makes a decison about the Russian sniper and his fellow agent whom he's been sent to save.  <br /> <br />The last story and the shortes is Bond in New York. He's been sent on a mission of mercy and plans to enjoy himself in Manhattan. We learn of Ian Flemming's opinion of frozen food and that Bond once had an apartment in Manhattan!  <br /> <br />I wouldn't buy this short story collection first. Try the full length novels and then this one because it's all so much about showing the other side of Bond. This is a treat for serious Bond lovers, old and new.	2005-01-06

It has all the right indgridients and has an interesting plot as well as a likeable lead character but somehow it never really rises above adequate.  <br /> <br />An old woman is found murdered and the local pretty boy is suspected of being the killer. Our hero, a former Templar knight (imagine a 12th century Catholic Jedi) must find the killer and prevent more murders. Along the way he's bedazzled by a sexy widow who may know more about the murder than she should.  <br /> <br />It's a solid begining but the story is marred by a horribly slow pace, and by historical blunders. The wolf scene was beautifully written but it rejects both history and animal behavior. The author also occasionally makes the mistake of making people from  the past think and talk like folks do today.  <br /> <br />There are things to like about this book but there wasn't enough to make me want to stick with the series.	2004-12-31

Each movie is seriously discussed and at the end of each synopsis there is a fairly weak attempt at humor. I expected a book by the Razzie Awards founder to be more lively.  <br /> <br />Now as for content, this book has all the famous bad flicks like Trog, and Posieden Adventure and The Love Machine. It also has a couple of movies included that weren't bad and are probably just included becuase the author didn't like the star of the movie.  <br /> <br />I found this book to be somewhat of a let down. It's okay but nothing really special and if you are a lover of bad movies you can safely get any of the other books on this topic before you get this one.	2004-12-31

Reading Thunderball is a great pleasure for Bond fans because the movie was so faithful to the book. There were a few things left out becuase they were considered too much for the big screen.     Ian Fleming must have had a marvelous sense of humor becuase the chapters where Bond finds himself stuck at Shrublands, drinking tea and vegatable broth and longing for spaghetti and chianti are extremely funny. Later when things get serious the reader gets wonderful scenes with M. who really was a fascinating character. The old man was even more ruthless than Bond.    The biggest thing Thunderball did was to introduce the world to Blofeld and nevermind the Austin Powers jokes, the original Blofeld was a very dangerous, very scary dude. The description of Largo and the scenes with Bond's old pal, Felix Leiter are also great.     I'm very happy that the old (real) Fleming books are being re-released in such good quality paper and with such snappy retro covers. My dad's old copies were literally crumbling whenever I touched them.	2004-12-03

It's the true story of how one woman went from welfare to million dollar success using an old family recipe for syrup. It's a truly amazing story but it's not written well. It's too dry, and is too choppy. It reads like it was put together from a taped interview or speech and it's also bit cold.

All he needs is one really big score. After a planned scam falls flat in Philadelphia he skips out on a $600 hotel bill and takes a train to Atlantic City. Once he hits the New Jersey station our antihero calmly steals two very expensive pieces of luggage---fine hotels look closely at guests who don't have luggage and in his line of work Joe doesn't want to be looked at carefully. That's when things get greasy. The luggage contains a box of heroin. It's enough to make him rich or get him killed. As fate would have it he meets a woman, the beautiful Mona who happens to be the wife of the man whose luggage Joe stole. Suddenly our smooth, tough minded con man finds himself in the midst of a whirlwind. He's in love for the first time in his life but Mona loves money. The answer of course is to get rid of the husband, a rich, dangerous old man who just might kill Joe and Mona first. And what about that heroin?  <br /> <br />Grifter's Game would've made a great addition to the film noir genre. Reading it you can almost see a young Burt Lancaster as Joe or Lana Turner as Mona. This book is excellently written, exiting and it makes you care about Joe and Mona two people who certainly aren't saints.	2004-11-03

Max Phillips has written a book that can stand in with the best of them. The hero, Ray a would be writer, has had a knock around life. He's a tough guy who doesn't mind doing what needs to be done but only if it squares with his personal code of honor. Rebecca LaFontaine is one of the most interesting heroines I've read about in a very long time. She's got so many sides to her character and all are complicated. The more Ray learns about her, the more he wants to know.  <br /> <br />The side characters are all what you'd expect from a 1950s crime novel. There are gangsters, small time hoods, wise cracking girl Fridays, world weary loyal friends and of course, stooges. All of these characters are written beautifully. None of this is cliched or fake. I kept looking at the copyright page to find the orignial publication date and was amazed to find that this is a newly published original novel. THis is an exciting book that never lets up the suspense. You will be shocked by the ending. It's the last think you'd suspect.

They dont' care if your house is pretty they're talking about preventing illnesses brought on by human skin flakes, bedbugs, dust mites dust in general and bacteria. I prefer Home Comforts because it's an encyclopedia of the science of homekeeping but How Clean is Your House is an excellent guide for the novice cleaner or anyone who's house has gotten out of hand.	2004-10-17

She's brash, opinionated and funny. The book is called Searching for Nefertiti but it really ought be called something like My Life With Mummies. It's more about Dr. Fletcher's career and how she went from a being a Yorkshire teen to an authority on ancient Egypt.  <br /> <br />The book is very entertaining. You get a glimpse of what Egyptology is--it's not glamorous. There's heat, dust, bad smells, dangerous people, bad food and no plumbing--and you get an idea of how much joy this job brings to the people who do it.  You also get a fine understanding of life in ancient Egypt. They were complicated people, far mores so than the movies would have us believe. Dr. Fletcher's special study of ancient wigs and jewelry gives her a more intimate view of the everyday private life of the ancients. <br /> <br />Now, about the Younger Woman mummy. Is it Nefertiti? I don't think so but I can't say that I mind because the book is just so much fun to read.	2004-10-16

Most of the book is okay. Young Nigel had a genuine trauma in his childhood. Imagine being a horribly spoiled child and then suddenly finding yourself without the one person who loved you the most. Nigel's mother spends most of the book dying and because Slater wrote the book from his perspective as a child he spends most of the book being oblivous to her condition. Later after his mother's death poor little Nigel can't figure out why his father is so nice to the family housekeeper. Before he knows it his father marries the housekeeper and the rest of the book is about Nigel being pushed further and further away from his dad's heart. It's sort of a Cinderella story without the happy ending. This should be deeply moving stuff but it isn't. You won'treally like little Nigel (he was bratty and snobbish) and frankly I found myself cheering for the clever lowerclass housekeeper. About half way through the book I got bored.  The book is just plain dreary.	2004-10-08

Hornet's Nest is a decent work of fiction. It's a little dull in places and no-one can compare this to John Jakes's stuff. People won't be reading it 40 years from now but that's okay. The book has sturdy, business like writing. Most of the details are correct. Carter doesn't try to make his hero sound like a 21rst century man and except for one silly mistake (Nobody wore trousers back then. Men wore breeches and they were always tight) it works.

His sentence structure, story telling skill  and spelling leave a lot to be desired but in this book's case it's not that important. 30 Years is a shocking look into the JW past. It's a past that most modern JWs know nothing about. Schnell writes about how he got hooked into the sect and details his life in it. Being a JW in the early days of the religion meant blind obediance, poverty and constant knawing dread. Schnell's life was so totally wrapped up in the sect that he barely had time for a normal family.

There's Aunt Ruthie, a  little old lady who looks sweet but has a tounge like a razor, Aunt Gertie who married badly but proudly carried on, Granny Ethel who was a great beauty but a terrible mother, grandfather Jacob who came from Europe as a boy, made a fortune and fell in love with one look. In between the chapters on her relatives Volk drops a few mentions of the restaraunt that kept the family going and settles a few scores. Like her Aunt Lil she remembers everything and tells all. <br /> <br />You wouldn't want to know these people-- except for Nana Polly and Audrey most were really dreadful folks-- and you certainly wouldn't want to work for any of them but it's a fascinating peep into a world most of us are totally unfamiliar with. If you like books about New York, or foodie books or just love a juicy memoir Stuffed will satisfy.	2004-09-02

For every wide eyed innocent who makes it big in movies there are 100 who end up in porn, prostitution, stripping or as groupies.  <br /> <br />The authors all were pathetic women who had encounters with some of Hollywoods sickest, meanest stars.

Once I began reading it I could not put it down. Wright's emotional growth and life were stunted by a domineering mother. The book does not take the easy path by making Edie the complete villain and I think if Edie could've looked into the future and seen what was in store for her daughter she may well have done things differently. There was love but it was the smothering kind. By the time her mother died Dare Wright had no idea how to cope without her or how to live like an adult.  <br /> <br />The section on Wright's decline was incredibly disturbing and when I cried when I read it. But this is not a totally downbeat biography. It celebrates Dare Wright's work. It celebrates her career and those quicksilver years when it seemed that there was nothing she couldn't do. This is a well written biography about a remarkable subject.	2004-08-21

If his wife had chosen to just watch him dive instead of becoming his creation would he have been as happy with her?  <br /> <br />The love story aside, when the book talks about the sport of free diving it picks up steam and becomes somewhat interesting but not enough.

That should've been my warning not to buy the book (anytime a book is called an alternative, a rival, or &quot;in the tradition of&quot; you can be sure that all you're going to get is a poor pale copy) but I decided to give it a chance anyway. Shadowmancer doesn't come anywhere near the hype. The villain, a rogue vicar is the best character but even he isn't all that original. If Voldemort and the White Witch had a halfhearted quick affair that resulted in a child it would be this guy.  <br /> As for the heroes. They aren't well done. Each seems like a cardboard stock character. I just was not interested in them or their struggle.  <br />  <br /> Shadowmancer is not a bad book but it's not a terrific one either. If you're looking for something to hold you over until the next Harry Potter book comes out or if for whatever reason you are one of those people who wouldn't dream of letting your kids read a Potter book in your home Shadowmancer is not what you are looking for.	2004-08-01

He and Napoleon Hill are the granddaddies of the entire self-help industry and his book still has much to say.<br /><br />The book is completely free of pyshobabble. You will not be asked to look for your inner child. You will not be asked to blame your parents. You will be encouraged to help yourself. You will be asked to let go of old hurts, hates, and bitterness. You will be told over and over again that there is hope and that you can change your life.<br /><br />The first half of the book is solid gold. Dale Carnegie never presented himself as perfect. He pointed out his own anxieties and showed how he freed himself from them. He also uses examples from famous and oridinary people of the day showing how they picked themselves up. Go through the book with a highlighter, photocopy sections, write down some of the quotes and tape them to your computer or wall or bathroom mirror where you can see them everyday.<br /><br />Now about the second half. Okay, it's not as good and I think Carnegie probably added it to please his publishers. It doesn't matter. The first half of the book makes up for the weakness of this section.<br /><br />If you are going through a bout of the blues or if you've been a big time frantic worrier for all of your life check out How to Stop Worrying and Start Living.

In Inside the Kingdom, Carmen Bin Laden tells the story of how she went from being a free spirited  Swiss schoolgirl to the wife of one of the members of the Saudi Arabian Bin Laden clan. It was easy. She was young, he was charming, handsome, rich and seemingly easy going. They fell in love. She thought they were going to live in America and Europe. She was wrong.<br />Imagine living in a place where it's against the law for you to show your face in public. Imagine not being able to go shopping even for your own clothes or personal items. Imagine shocking your in-laws becuase you want to go for a walk. <br />One  of the most vivid and sad scenes from the book describes how Carmen's husband had to make special arrangements in order for her to go to a grocery store to buy baby formula. While she rushed to the baby section the customers (all male) left the store and the staff turned their backs to her.<br />Carmen quickly discovered to her horror that listening to music was considered sinful, reading books was considered odd and having a thought in one's pretty head was seen as completely unnatural. <br />Eventually, the marriage soured and Carmen decided to leave Saudi for the sake of her daughters. The book will attract attention of course because of the author's infamous brother-in-law, Osama (he was apparently a foreboding figure even as a young man) but it's more than a tragi-comic look into the Bin Laden home. This book is a clear eyed look at Saudi life.<br />Carmen Bin Laden went to Saudi thinking that modernity would prevail and that in a few years Saudi women would have more rights. She was wrong then and things don't look any better now. Since Saudi Arabia is ostensibly an American ally taking an honest look at it makes sense. Can such a culture really change? Are we fools to it expect to? <br />Inside the Kingdom is a very good book.I'm glad Ibought it.	2004-07-17

It's about orphaned Lewis who comes to live with his uncle Jonathan. Uncle is a wizard but Lewis is too miserable to discover that until much later. Lewis is an extremely well written character. He's a nice kid whom the readers will identify with. He's smart, and funny but becuase he's shy and overweight the town bullies turn on him. His unhappiness at school leads to what he thinks is a gift.

I've never been comfortable with the rapture theory. After reading Rapture Trap I now know why. Paul Thigpen does a complete investigation of the secret second coming theory and destroys it. He points out that the at the heart of the rapture theory is a rejection of Christianity's mandate to go out and be salt and light in a weary, wicked world. The Bible makes it clear the Jesus won't come back in invisible stealth. It makes no promises that believers will be privately whisked away when the tribulation comes. <br />Thigpen offers one very sobering point that really startled me: Consider the fact that the apostles all suffered and died for their Faith. Think about all the saints who were martyred in the Roman arenas. Think about the Ugandan and Vietnamese marytrs and the millions of Christians who are NOW suffering horribly in China, the Middle East and the Sudan. The rapture folks aparently believe that they are more righteous and precious to God than all these people.  That is a powerful and really frightening point and it demolished any validity to the rapture theory for me.<br />I would give the book 4 stars for that alone but Thigpen goes on to discuss where this rapture nonsense comes from. Although it has it's roots in German Europe, the full flower of the theory is a totally American thing. In short, it's not an ancient belief and is one that the early church fathers would've looked in askance of. <br />Now, Thigpen is a little dry in his writing style and I think the book could've been shorter but that's okay. This book isn't for entertainment it's for setting the worried and  confused individual straight. If you are troubled by the rapture theory, or have been pressured by friends and family to read and believe the Left Behind books you seriously need to read this book.	2004-07-04

It was supposed to be the first of a 3 part series but she died before completing it. It is the story of John the second son of Henry IV, brother to Henry V and grandson of John of Gault. The book begins in the nursery playroom with three little boys and dances back and forth between the views of their beloved grandfather, their father, their step grandmother, Katherine Swynford, the strange and sometimes insane Richard II and back again to each one of the boys. This is an impressive literary feat. Getting into a character's head and making that character come to life for the reader is hard and Heyer did it beautifully. Their are heroes here and villains, pitiful victims and people who were simply trying to get along. Heyer brought the Middle Ages to life. What a shame that she never got to finnish the series.	2004-07-04

It was only 50 cents so I got it. Well, should you come across it you can safely skip it. Ms. Barrows pretty much uses this book as a platform to defend herself and explain why she turned to pimping. That's okay, but wasn't that the purpsoe of her first book? So after re-reading her story again in Between Us Girls you finally get the meat of the book and what do you get? Not much. Mostly, Barrows argues that in order to hold on to your man you have to act like a $500 a night call girl in the bedroom. You must be on guard, on your toes and ready to perform at a moments notice. To back this up she points out that some of her old clients actually left thier wives and families to marry her girls. I wonder how long those marriages lasted?  Should you take Ms. Barrow's advice? That's up to you but ask yourself this: If you have to do turn yourself into a geisha in order to hold onto your man is he really worth it?	2004-06-27

This book is a sweeping peep into Stephen King's (circa the early 80s) head and the experience is very much like what you  would expect to feel if you could've sat down on the couch with him and a couple of beers. <br />The book jumps back between the 50s and 80s all the way through. One minute you'll be reading about Dracula the next you'll read about young Steve's experiment with a dead cat. There is a lot of horror ground covered in this book, perhaps too much. King goes from a brilliant discussion of the 3 great granddaddies of horror: Dracula, Frankenstien, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to the best and worst of horror movies to horror on TV (Interestingly enough King didn't seem to grasp how great, Thriller, Outer Limits and Twilight Zone were) and then sort of splatters along with observations on modern horror novels, a few writers that King admired and throws in a couple of other oddities as well. <br />The book is very self indulgent. It appears to not have been edited and you have to remember that King was still a young man when he wrote it. If some of his views seem terribly shallow it's the youth talking and I find myself wishing that King would update the book. The big flaw of the book is King's really, really annoying Vietnam tangents. They are all over the book and go on for several paragraphs and don't have a thing to do with the book's stated subject.  <br />Danse Macabre isn't perfect but about 75% of it is extremely entertaining. If you skip over the boring parts, the obsessive parts and don't mind the sloppy last chapter and if you really love the horror genre then it is book worth putting on your &quot;keeper&quot; list.	2004-06-24

Baroness Thatcher tells the story of her life with humor and restraint. She never uses being a woman as a crutch or excuse and although she obviously loved her husband and children the main focus of the book is what was going on in her head. Tough, stubborn and bold she slowly pushes forward through school, through a legal career, through the back benches and finally when the chance for the highest office in the land comes her way she pounces on it. <br />Path to Power is excellent reading for those who find Parliment to be incomprehensible, for those who wonder if an American woman can ever be another Thatcher and for those who simply like a Horatio Alger story. Now, is it a bit dry? Yep, it certainly is but you didn't really expect gooey girl talk from Margaret Thatcher, did you?	2004-06-24

The author rails against whites who moved to the suburbs or placed their children in private schools and against blacks who did the same. She seems to long for some sort of state run utopia where we are all forced to live side by side and forced to smile and like it or else.<br />No thanks. <br />In the wake of the aniversary of Brown v. Board of Education several silly books like this were published. All, and this one especially failed to grasp what Brown was about. It wasn't that black people need to be near whites or that we can't live without them in our neighborhoods or schools. Brown was about the chance to go out and meet opportunity. We are free to go to school where we want. The national guard doesn't have to be activated in order to get black chidren into a shchool anymore. We are free to live where we want. We are free to socialize with whomever we want. I'd hardly call that integration's failure. The book and the author don't make their cases.	2004-06-24

Relatives or other inmates of Wilkerson should have come forward to confirm or deny the story. Relatives of the victim who was hit by the hotdog cart should've come forward.<br />Apparently none of these things happened so I don't feel comfortable calling the book a memoir but frankly, it almost (but not quite which is why I can't give it 5 stars) doesn't matter. This a towering book of probably part fact and part fiction (the trial scenes are imposible) that you will not forget. Carcaterra is a brilliant writer and the book is worth every penny.

It's the story of a young man who finds himself in jam. He's got a scholarship to go to law school and a girlfriend who's made it clear to him that she won't wait for him while he's studying. What does our young hero do? Does he run towards a future without his girlfriend or does he hang on to the past in the name of love?<br />The characters in this book are wonderfully written. All of them talk and react as real people would. I really cared about the hero and cheered when he discovers that growing up isn't all about doing as you please.<br />Ernest Hill has created a really excellent book.	2004-05-30

Everythig they publish is wonderfully written, packed with informattion and fun. <br />Essential Shakespeare gives you an overview of Shakespeare's life, looks at the different argurments about his &quot;true&quot; identity and talks about the role and realities of theater life in the Elizabethan and Jacobean ages. Next it launches into in depth discussions about each play, long poem and gives a quick look at the sonnets. <br />The book sumarizes each play, gives you a who's who among the characters and then tells you in detail what happens act by act. Then it talks about how the play has been shown to audiences through out the years. Like all DK books it's full of pictures and sidebars.<br />I spent hours readig this book and only put it down because I had to get up early the next morning. Essential Shakespeare is not only a great gift for a Shakespeare lover but it's a really effective way to itroduce the works of the Bard to someone who didn't know much or anything about them before. <br />Alls well that ends well, this book is most definitely worth the money.	2004-05-24

I don't think I've read anything this sad in ages.  Here was a talented, charming and highly astute man who really could've made history but instead he almost came to social and political ruin.<br />This book carefully explained what Brown blundered into and why it was so bad. The only criticisms I have are these: the author relies just a tad bit too much on one of Brown's companions for details (the natural urge to see oneself in the best light probably colors this person's memories) and overdoes it with the melodramatic foreshadowing. We all know what happened to Brown so there's no need to harp on what's coming in each chapter.<br />One sensible thing Cashill does is that he didn't get bogged down in a conspiracy theory. He offers the reader a number of scenarios to explain why the plane crashed and how Brown's body got the infamous head wound. He then allows the reader to make up his or her own mind and he withdraws.<br />For the most part it's a well written and surprisingly sympathetic book. The chapters on Brown's visit to a chapel before his death and the jockeying for position at his funeral are worth the its price alone.	2004-05-19

Katherine is the story of Katherine Swynford the mistress of John of Gaunt. Their romance was remarkable in that it lasted until his death. In spite of all practical concerns after years of waiting John and Katherine shocked the world by marrying. <BR>Anya Seton takes you right into Katherine's world and you fall in love with John just as she does. <br />Another great thing Seton does is the way she handles Sir Hugh's character. It would have been easy to make him a cardboard villain but she doesn't. Crude, ugly and not much more sophisticated than the lowliest serf Hugh becomes a sympathetic figure becasue Seton clearly shows that he loves his wife but it too proud and too afraid to show it.<br /><BR>Now, is this the true story? Was Katherine really as great a heroine as she's presented in this book? Well, as the saying goes if this isn't the true sotry it ought to be. I loved this book as a teen and it's still a favorite. I'm so happy that this new edition has been published.	2004-05-11

Finally somebdody says it out loud: Most women's magazines sell misery.  About 10 years ago it dawned on me that reading my favorite magazines was well, depressing. All the articles were either about losing weight, (You arent' good enough as you are) or were about sex (You aren't good enough) or how to get a man,keep a man, change a man (Men are the enemy but you can tame one through clever manipulation)or seemed to be pushing some new crisis. They painted a picture of American women that makes us look dumb, helpless and under constant attack. The lifestyle magazines were bad but the fashion mags were even worse. And they all seemed to be pushing a political agenda. <br />Today I still read a lot of magazines but the Vogues, the Allures, Redbooks and Good Housekeepings don't cross my doorstep. Martha Blyth was actually part of the women's mag industry for many years. She took part in slinging the women's mag slop and admits it. The book is very good and explains  completely why women's magazines are so dreary and how the readers are being manipulated.	2004-04-11

For those who worship celebrities -- many of whom are seriously messed up, uneducated individuals -- this book is will come as a shock. Your gods have feet of clay and with their PR machine out of way they are no prettier, smarter, nicer or more talented than you. <br />After reading this very dishy, very tough expose I was left wondering about the whole American cult of celebrity.

It was considered vicious trash by the critics but the public ate it up. Reading it almost 30 years later I'm struck with the feeling that the hype was more than the book. There have been allegations that Kelly relied on backstairs gossip and a lot of what's in here can't be proven. Then there is the fact that Jackie was alive when the book was published. Kelly's decision to write about Jackie's treatment for depression (The woman lost a son and a husband within months. Who wouldn't be depressed?) seemed simply cruel for the sport of it.<br />Reading Jackie Oh is kind of like finding your old high school year book and being embarrased by the clothes, the hobbies and the sentiments written therein. You look at it and are chagrined at how important such sillines seemed at the time.	2004-04-11

When I was a kid the only people who I knew who got fired were a couple of odd relatives by marriage who were generally thought of as the family nut cases.

You can be a great employee and still get the corporate shaft. The odds are a firing or whatever euphemism you want to use could be in your future so grab Mr. Laskoff's book and get ready. <br />The book is very funny, and is the only career book I've read so far that honestly describes how humiliating and frightning it is to be out of work but Laskoff doesn't just allow his readers to wallow in grief. As he states himself, this is not a pychobabble book. It's a pratical guide to getting back on the right side. Laskoff tells you the truth about resumes, how to really work an interview and how to negotiate when you get a job offer. It's a great book.	2004-04-06

It's a history book that is fast paced, written with all the drama of a novel and even has an elment of supsense. Great Betrayal tells the story of how the League of Nations treaty fell apart. It brings all the players from the proud and inflexible Woodrow Wilson, to Henry Cabot Lodge and Lord Grey. And it includes includes comments from editorial pages from around the country and Europe at the time. Woodrow Wilson was an extremely difficult man and particularly after his illness (the book makes it clear that Wilson should've resigned) he may have been one of the prime reasons why the treaty failed. I really enjoyed this fascinating look into a piece of our country's history that still affects us to this day.	2004-03-19

I have to say that it is quite well written. Randine Lewis presents her case clearly and consisely. She doesn't make any wild claims and she's not pretending that her mehtods are the only ones that will work. I went looking for something to criticize in this book and I can't find anything. It's the best &quot;natural&quot; infertilty book I've come across and I've read enough of them to fill a book case over the years. <br /> Now, who is this book for? I think it's best for mature readers who have nothing left to lose. If you no longer have any illusions and won't be heartbroken if this doesn't work out go ahead and buy this book. However, I would say to any potential reader to go to her doctor first and then to remember two things: Rhinos and tigers are endangered mainly becuase Eastern medicine promotes the idea that pills made from the bodies of these animals has medicinal benefit. In other words Eastern medicine is not perfect. It's a diferent approach to the human condition, not necesarily a better one. This is a entertaining, and highly readable book but don't expect a miracle; okay?	2004-02-18

Some of the art,such as Unexpected Party or Gandalf with the Balrog was simply brilliant. Some of it looks dated today such as the hideous 1976 granny dress that Galadriel wears or the Sgt. Pepper mustache on Aragorn and the silly looking Fell beasts ridden by Nazgul who look like they're about to fall off at any minute. Oh well. Nobody got out of the 70s without some style howlers. Laugh at the funny stuff and be awed by the great.<br />One of the strongest and most charming elements of the book is  the descriptions from Greg Hildebrant's son who was five when the brothers began working on the calenders. Young Greg's memories are full of wonder that's in keeper with what his uncle and father were working on. It's not all sweetness and light however, young Greg remembers that toward the middle of the project things got increasingly difficult in the studio. The pressures of the deadline, creative disagreements and artistic disappointments (Among other things the brothers didn't have time to do a huge battle scene that they'd planned) and the need to do separate projects are all mentioned.<br />Besides all three Hildebrandt calenders, the book has  pictures of privately commissioned works (some of which are better than the orginal paintings), prelim sketches, and photos of the models. If you loved the work of the brothers or have just discovered it this will be a highly entertaining treat for you.	2004-01-28

I picked up this book expected to chuckle. I thoght it would be along the lines of the Worse Case books. It starts out with that droll, almost English tounge in cheek humor and rapidly gets serious. It's obvious Max Brooks did some research. Everything you ever wanted to know about zombie lore plus a dollop of human history and nature is thrown in. <br />The first half of the book talks about dealing with a class 1 through 4 zombie outbreak and offers advice such as don't go down in the basement, don't go to the hospital--there's dead and dying folks there to begin with, keep moving, don't let the zombie get close enough to touch you, and keep quiet until you reach safety. <br />The second half describes recorded attacks from ancient time until today and it's actually scary. If Max Brooks ever decides to write straight horror fiction I'll buy it. The story about the slave ship full of zombies gave me genuine chills. <br />Another very amusing and clever touch is the way Brooks never breaks away from the tone of the book. The dedication, introduction, about the author page and acknowlegement pages all <BR>stick to the book's theme. All in all, I'm delighted with this book. It's funny and scary and that is very difficult to pull off. Head to your secure location, turn the lights down, turn the radio off and read this little thriller.  Max Brooks, take a bow!	2004-01-18

Ms. Raines states very strongly that there is nothing wrong with seeking mental help and I commend her for that.	2004-01-18

He's seriously thinking of quitting and goes as far as composing a bitter resignation from the Secret Service. He's restless, unhappy and is looking for ...something. And then he meets a girl. In the middle of a romance that surprises and even scares him a little Bond gets handed an asignment that turns out to be far more complicated than even he could've dreamed. Blofeld is back and this time their encounter becomes personal. <br />If you saw the excellent movie then you know what happens. <br />Ian Fleming did a fantastic job with the sublte foreshadowing. Bond meets Tracy in the same town where he met Vesper Lynde in Casino Royale. We learn that he's been visiting Vesper's grave once a year for years. It reminds the reader that Bond does have a heart and it can be moved. Later, Bond, to his chagrin realizes that he wants to wrap this Blofeld business up mainly so he can get back to Tracy.<br />In addition to this, the usual Bond trademarks are here.  You have a horrifying villain, revolting flunkies, glorious scenary, a desperate chase that almost gets Bond killed and an unforgetable ending.	2004-01-11

From the very begining it's obvious that there is somehting wrong in this ordinary suburban home. It's inhabited by ghosts and seems to have a mind of its own as well. Three families, all with desperate problems, buy it one after another and the house deals with them. <br />The first and most interesting are a young married couple; Becca and Dan. Becca is too snooty, cold and hard and her talented,dreamy husband is too soft. The house dislikes Becca but wants to play awhile with her husband.<br />The second family consists of a miserable woman and her even more miserable 8 year old son. The house and several of it's ghosts offers them a solution but it's one that most of us would probably reject. <br />The final family consists of Richie and his son. Richie is a talented writer who can't go one hour without a drink and is rapidly turning into a mean drunk. Something in the attic reaches out to Richie and something in him reaches out to it. <br />Laced in between the adventures of the happy homeowners is the story of Glenn, the sensible, sane and newly widowed realtor who sells the house to all these people. She likes the house and  can't understand why it seems to have so much bad luck. <br />The Dwelling is not a gobs of grue type of horror novel. If you grew up on Uncle Stephen King or delight in Poppy Brite this is not the book for you. It's a cool, intellectual type of horror that belongs more to the Shirley Jackson school. Terrible things happen in this book but they are written up in such a subtle way that you may need to go back a re-read certain sections to figure out what just happened.  You don't see the bogey man in the closet but you do feel his breath on your neck in the dark. You don't get a pages long description of the ghoul under the bed but you know he's there waiting to caress your foot if you let it stick out from under the covers. It's that type of book. <BR>I liked it and I really appreciated the non ambiguous ending.<BR> <BR>My only nitpick--and it's a tiny one is the use of the elderly neighbor. She appears for a deliciously spooky scene and is abruptly withdrawn. I got the feeling that she has a bigger part in the story but it was edited out except for this one brilliant scene.	2004-01-01

Simon Cowell has written an extremely amusing book. It starts out logical with Simon's childhood. He was by his own admission a really ghastly little kid and grew up into the kind of teenager that makes teachers retire. His saving grace was his love of music. Luckily he ended up with a music career and became a producer. From that success he was able to create Pop Idol and it's American spin-off, American Idol. <br />Simon is very, very frank in his opinions and I think he is mostly right. Britney Spears has made a miscalculation with her image, Madonna really hasn't produced a monster hit in America in years and Michael Jackson's career has suffered a totally self inflicted wound. <br />The behind the scenes gossip is the meat of the book and the tidbits are fascinating. One contestant alienated the show's crew members because of a foul attitude, another contestant blew it due to weird behavior. Another, probably lost because of one off night in a performance. <br />The best part of the book is Simon's advice to aspiring singers. Talent isn't enough to get you over. As he points out, there are a lot of talented folks singing in hotel lounges, and at amusement parks. Getting to the big time takes smarts, guts and strategy. I wouldn't want to sing in front of Simon and I don't think I'd invite him to dinner but the man has a way with words and I enjoyed the book.	2003-12-24

Actually it's not. The book is not good at all. The reluctant sleuth, Helen, who we are told is very smart, and savy is on the run from the law back home in St. Louis and now jumps around the country working for cash and living quietly. Once she made a six figure income and now she's half a step from poverty. It's kind of like a female Fugitive but the heroine is such an annoying and stupid woman you won't care about her plight. This is a short book but Helen falls into bed with two terrible men in the space of a few days. The character learns nothing and shows no growth at all. <BR>The mystery actually is set up well. Page Turner III, the victim is a swine who no one misses after his death. Helen stumbles and bumbles her way through this case and finally figures it out with a few pages to spare at the end. <BR>I just didn't like this book and won't buy more from this series. The heroine was just too dumb, the humor was flat and the side characters were stereotypical.	2003-12-10

I assume that shortly after she began writing Rita Mae Brown fell in love with her intended victim and decided to spare him. I fell for the character too and was very glad that she did. Apparently someone at the publishers didn't get the message and wrote up a blurb with the orginial plotline. Oh well. <br />Now for the book itself. I love the character of Sister Arnold. I love the interplay between her and her pack and the flawed, maddening and fascinating souls in the hunt club but this was NOT the best book in the series. I'd say that honor belongs to Hotspur. I'm happy that Brown managed the trick of making black characters behave like humans and not stereotypes and I'm glad Sister found some love in her life, I'm even gladder that the I wasn't treated to a long love scene. I really didn't want a full blown description of how Janie Arnold gets her groove back but the relationship with her new love interest didn't seem natural. What was it about this man that made him more appealing that all the other men in Sister's life? I never saw it.  <br />Here's what I didn't like: The animals didn't get their due. All of their conversations and scenes were too short. <BR>One major character who we've come to love to hate does not get his comeupance. I felt let down. <BR>The victims weren't interesting. In Outfoxed, the victim is a fascinating individual who almost deserves what happens. In Hotspur you care passionately about Nola and Guy though they've been dead 20 years by the time the story gets going. In Full Cry I didn't care about the victims. They are just &quot;off camera&quot; throw away characters. It was as if Brown was in a hurry and just wanted to get the murder over with. <BR>In both Hotspur and Outfoxed the killer is interesting and in Hotspur, sympathetic. In Full Cry the killer is drab. <br />I was thrilled by Hotspur and Outfoxed so this half hearted effort was reallya disappointment. I hope that Rita Mae Brown will do another Sister book. I want this series to get back on its feet.	2003-11-19

It is full of violence, passion, lust, envy, anger, love and grace. The folks in the Jefferson County Hunt Club are all so complex and each one has his or her own fully fleshed out backstory and then there are the animals: Dragon the arrogant hound, Inky the black fox, wise Aunt Netty the red fox, Athena the fearless horned owl and Raleigh the devoted Doberman. The creatures in Rita Mae Browns books all have intense lives and opinions of their own and I cared about them as much if not more than the people.<br /> Some reviewers complained that the book gets too deeply into the day to day life of the hunt but that IS what the book is about :Sister Jane's life with murder thrown in to complicate things. I loved Sister. She's a tough old girl with a mind as sharp as Jane Marple. My only regret with this entire series is that Sister is 71. I hope this series goes on for quite a while and at this rate Sister may have to live to be over 100 like Poirot did. <br />If you want a book that offers a complete escape from the ordinary and you want a book that takes its time to settle into the story then you'll like Hostspur.	2003-11-14

Unless someone finds a confession with the Rippers real name on it we will never know who he really was but Cornwell's book is FAR superior to idiocy like Prince Jack or any of the silly books that attempt to pin the killings on elderly Dr. Gull. While I think she's mistaken I do respect the research, the mighty effort and the entertaining prose. Never mind what the critics said, this book is worth your time and money.	2003-11-05

My parents owned a copy but I was never allowed to read it. Finally after all these years I saw the new edition and bought it. Things certainly have changed. Rachel and Trudy were lighthearted, funny girls who got into madcap adventures that no sane flight attendent today would dare try. <br />Back in the 60s stews had to be single, attractive and thin, today as anyone can tell you flight attendents don't have to be any of these things. Sex seemed to be a game both men and women were playing. Today romance on the job isn't much fun at all. Back then flying was still fun. Today it's more like Dante's Inferno. Rachel & Trudy occasionally dealt with pervert passengers, and often with drunks and rotten kids but the whole phenomenon of air rage was stil unknown. <br />Some of the observations Rachel and Trudy made about  certain types of  male passengers were considered beyond the pale back in '67, today we don't even give it a second thought. Check out their comments on page 237 and you'll see what I mean. One more thing I noticed about this funny book. It couldn't be written today.

It's not a defense like Chief Moose's book, nor is it sensational like the two other books by reporters. In Mr. Ward's book he tells the story of each shooting, and because he is a native of the area he describes as only a native can what the scene of each crime looks like today and how it looked when he was a boy. Ward also explains why these killings so horrified 4 million people who lived in the sniper's range. Each killing took place while the victims were doing normal, everyday suburban things. The killers attacked the old, the young, white, black and latino.  <BR>When Ward is discussing the crimes his book is quite good but when he gets to the heart of the book--the religious discussion he's not as good. He doesn't take any really strong stands. His comments are mild enough to offend no-one but they won't inspire anyone either. I found that a bit frustrating.	2003-10-03

Opal has finally gotten the strength to run from decades of abuse in her miserable marriage. Slowly she recovers herself and begins to build the life she always wanted and deserved. This book has a brave, resilient heroine, side characters who aren't cardbook stereotypes and it has a great story. Sheila Williams has written a book she can be very proud of.	2003-10-02

I remember malls being half empty, silent playgrounds and seeing people weaving and bobbing at the gas pump. It was a terrible time. Former Chief Charles Moose has written a book abou those days and it's infuriated a lot of people. For my part, I don't see why he couldn't write a book. A lot of people have made money from this case including reporters from USA Today. Also, according to Moose reporters from the Washington Post contacted him about joining with them to write a book of their own. <br />As for the book itself, it's a difficult read. Moose is not an easy man or an especially likeable one. His treatment of his first wife and his admited hot temper didn't endear him to me at all but the story of how a kid from North Carolina ended up as the Chief of Montgomery County (one of the richest, proudest and self satisfied places in Metropolitan DC) is interesting.<br /> The sad story of his parents deaths, and his early days in Portland, Oregon (I'm certainly crossing Portland off my list of places to visit!)are compelling. The book does a good job at showing how dull the day to day details of semi small town police work are. It's nothing like a TV show or movie. Moose is pretty honest about his shortcomings. He tells how he managed to deeply offend his officers by showing up at an academy graduation without his dress uniform and he tells the story of how he got the job of Chief of Portland.  <br />Now about the investigation. Frankly, despite what Moose says, his team didn't catch the snipers. The big break came because a trucker spotted the killers in their car and called the hotline. The trucker never would've noticed if a description of the car hadn't been released by the media. Perhaps this was too big for a small town man, perhaps the ATF and FBI should've taken over instead of providing assistance. We'll never know for sure.  The man in this book is complicated and angry. The book is worthreading because of this perhaps unintended portrait.	2003-09-19

I'll put that to the side for a minute. The story is actually well done. It tells kids in a clever way about being fair, the wrongness of envy and the truth that things aren't always what they appear to be. The art work is decent and it's rather nicely written. <BR>Now back to Madonna. If you find her revolting or if you think this is nothing more than  a publicity stunt then obviously this book isn't for you. If you're neutral you may want to wait until it shows up in your public library. Most little kids don't or shouldn't even know who Madonna is so this is probably a best bet for her fans.	2003-09-19

The organization was run by the mafia and it had violent ways of making clients quit. The Policy starts out in that theme but very quickly gets worse(in a good way). The mafia would be a blessed relief compared to the insurance company of this novel. <br />The hero and his hapless friends are offered insurance policies from agents who are foul mouthed, and vicious. They learn that turning down the offers lead to horrible events like ending up in jail or finding out that  relatives have been killed or that a newborn child has been ruined for life. <br />The tension and the horror keeps going up and when Hunt and his wife realize that the company and it's agents aren't human it's a brilliant, spooky moment. And then Bentley Little ruins it. I won't give it away but the ending was incredibly weak. Did Little lose interest in the book or did he just run out of steam?	2003-09-10

She was selfish, and had a bad habit of messing with men who were better left alone. It's clear that the author doesn't much like her subject and is more interested in Worthington's character flaws than anything else. That's why I couldn't enjoy the book. <br />The book is filled with annoying personal asides from the author and frankly, takes an intriguing crime and makes it dull. One of those quickie true crime paperbacks would've done a better job than this. Hopefully, a better writer will tackle this story.	2003-09-01

Walker	Books	4	3	8	N	N	The best Walker book yet	There have been other books about Madame C.J. Walker but this one is the best. It's not a romance and it doesn't offer a glossy,worshipful picture either. This solid biography tells the story of one woman who triumphed over incredible adversity. In a time when most black people were miserably poor Madame Walker built a fortune. The book tells what Madame did right and what she did wrong and it's the only one that really gets into what went wrong with her daughter and where the money went after Madame's death. Some people have objected to the book because the author is not black but what does that have to do with the ability to produce good scholarship? If you're interested in this fascinating woman and the turbulent times she lived in, give this book a chance.	2003-08-30

Dr. Barbet described in forensic detail what the body of a condemned man went through. He explains from history what the Romans commonly did to prisoners. For example, scourging wasn't just a beating. <br />Crucified victims died slowly, in agony from suffocation. I expected the book to be dry, it wasn't.

First, you have a woman who loves so intently that it's unhealthy. Second, you have a victim who is perfectly blameless and is far more loveable than Poirot's client.  Christie turns this into a psychological drama full of passion, envy, sadness. Poirot steps into the scene almost in mid book but it works. He's the laser sharp light that clears up the mess Elinor, Roddy and the killer have made. Seek this one out.	2003-08-17

Rise and Fall is a bit dry. It's a workmanlike text book but I enjoyed it. If you're coming to this book expecting romance, high drama and emotion go find another book. The author treats Anne like a politician or a warrior. She shows what steps Anne took and offers a theory as to why she took them and finally, the author shows why Anne fell. You'll probably enjoy Lady in the Tower or The Concubine better but if you collect Anne Boleyn books this is a worthy one for your collection.	2003-08-16

It doesn't get into how Wendy actually made her jump into stardom and it doesn't tell much about how a radio show is produced or what it's like to be a woman in the music industry.<br />I will give Wendy credit for one thing: She doesn't hold back when it comes to telling on herself. We get to read about her serious drug use, her miscarriages, her rape and her husband's affair. Whether she meant to or not she paints a picture of a profoundly unlikeable person. It's a curious book. Usually biographies don't work so hard to make you dislike the subject.	2003-08-01

It's a delicious &quot;cozy&quot; mystery that features a spunky, opinionated, bold heroine who runs an antique shop and lives in one of my favorite places, upstate South Carolina. From the very first line I was hooked. The book features huge chunks of laugh out loud hunmor, kooky characters and a web of clues, twists and turns. There's only one thing I didn't like: The killer turned out to be the one stereoytpe in the book. Making this person the villain was way too easy and seemed like an act of literary laziness to me. However, I love Tamar Myers's work. She's obviously done her research and has managed to pull of mystery with a dose of humor very well.	2003-08-01

After failing to graduate her exasperated mother packs her off to house sit for grandfather while he goes off on a lecture tour. Immediately, things get strange. Someone is terrorizing Lee and she suspects it's due to he skeletons in her family tree.  <br />So far so good. I liked Lee and I loved how the story moves along up to this point but two things come close to ruining the book for me. First: Are the nation's creative writing teachers all telling their students that black characters must be written the same way? Lee's black roommate from college is sassy, jokey, and calls her \\"baby\\" every five minutes. She also suffers a complete melt down at the sight of a 50 year old klan robe. The author meant well, with this character but I suspect she doesn't know any real live black people and based this character on stuff she's seen in the movies. Next, the description of New Orleans was dumb. As another reviewer said, things have changed. The Big Easy depends on tourism and the scene with the TV never would've happened in real life. The town has had  two black mayors, and the police force is mostly black. The author needed to do her research. <BR>Bottom line: Would I buy another one of this author's books? Yes, but only after I spend some time leafing through it first and after checking out the Amazon reviews.	2003-07-31

Noor's son is in line for the throne and one can assume that she wants him to get it so she tows the Middle East line. One would be tempted to believe the things she says about Jordan if it weren't for books like Lost Honor which tells about a recent so called &quot;honor killing.&quot;  There are a lot of unpleasant things about Jordan and the other Middle East countries that have nothing to do with Israel but you won't find any mention of them in the book. It's a completely sugar coated with whipped cream version of events.	2003-07-15

Poirot pulls himself out of semi retirement and puts his little grey cells to work at tackling secrets, lies and old sins that several people want desparately to keep hidden.

The book begins and ends in the period we now call Holy Week. The author spends a lot of time setting the scene, he talks about what Israel was like and briefly goes into who the political players were but the most important part of the book is when he discusses the attitudes and actions of the people involved. The innocence of the apostles, the guilt, jealousy and hopelessness of Judas, and the casually brutality of the Romans are all brought to life. This is a highly intellectual book that ought to be read slowly so you can fully understand some of the intricate things the author is saying.	2003-07-04

Levy was part playboy, part crusader and a passionate lover of beauty. He was also Jewish and for this reason he was not popular with the neighbors.  Later his nephew Thomas Jefferson Levy owned the place until 1923. The Levy family saved Monticello from ruin, made great efforts to preserve and restore the estate, especially the grave site but instead of being thanked for their efforts they were criticized. Disaster struck when Jefferson Levy invited a woman named Maude Littleton to dinner. She was horrified by the decor and apparently, the Levy's themselves and launched a national campaign to wrest Monticello from them. Levy fought back and when he did sell the estate it was to a private foundation that runs the living history site today. <BR>The Levy's presence was ignored or mentioned briefly and in offensive ways until the 80s but it's only with the publication of this amazing and highly entertaining book that they have really gotten their full due. <BR>If you are fascinated by the life of Jefferson and are curious about what happened after his death or if you love history, architecture or simply want to read a good story get yourself a copy of Saving Monticello.	2003-07-03

The Lady in the Tower is the story of Anne Boleyn. It begins and ends in the Tower with Anne, tired, wiser, and almost ready to die; trying to figure out where things went wrong. Once she was a king's beloved, now that same king was so sick of her that he'd signed her death warrant. How did she fall so far and so fast? Thus, the incredible story begins. <BR>Most biographies, fictional or not tend to skip over her years in France but this one spends quite a lot of time on them and it's to good effect. Anne's life in France helps to explain her actions in England. This is a sympathetic portrait that shows Anne as impetuous, thoughtless at times, and too ambitious but not the evil, scheming seductress that she's been painted as. Brilliant. If you've never read Jean Plaidy, this is a good one to begin with.	2003-06-25

It was great fun when I bought it in the 80s but it hasn't aged well. The whole thing has a heavy handed feminist air and since this is a collection of essays and opinions it's not entirely accurate. For example, the descriptions of the women of the James Bond novels is completley wrong.

The civilized world is danger, Sherlock Holmes is missing and believed dead  and Mina at the request of Campion Bond,( guess who's ancestor he is) and a mysterious person known as M, sets out to assemble a team up to the challenge: Dr. Allan Quartermain, Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and the Invisible Man. The only trouble is Dr. Quartermain's hooked on drugs, Jekyll can't control Hyde, who still enjoys killing people and the Invisible Man is still a meglomaniac. Can Mina hold them together and get the job done? <BR>This is a delicious romp for the classic literature lover and for the graphic novel fan. I do have to say as other reviewers have pointed out, there are intense scenes in League. This is a comic book but it's not for little kids, okay? Everything that was hinted at in the books that all these characters are derived from is fully described here. If you're sensitive about violence you might want to wait for the movie to come out.

By the end of the book I still felt terrible for the girls but only annoyance for Ms. Roush. <BR>It's horrible to think about two American girls being trapped in one of the most repressive countries on Earth but what can be done really? Should a team of commandos be sent in to snatch the girls or should the American government hammer Saudi Arabia with sanctions?The first option won't fly. Nobody wants to see American soldiers get killed for the sake of a domestic dispute and if America punishes Saudi Arabia what about all the other countries? American children are in Germany and other European countries with their mothers and their American fathers can't even see them. The situation is also reversed. American parents have snatched children away from foreign born parents. <br />This is a sad story and there is a lesson in it for the reader: think before you marry a foreigner.	2003-05-28

They were doomed but didn't want to know it. The  family should've left years before but convinced that everything would be eventually fine if they stayed out of the public eye and caused no trouble, they stayed. That was a mistake. The author's father was arrested, tortured and hung. Her mother was shockingly abused and her grandmother was murdered. The family fled to Israel. <br />After this heartbreaking begining the book doesn't quiet down. The author's years in Israel were happy but eventually she and her husband and kids went to America and oddly enough, that's wear her life got really interesting. Anonymous became a researcher and went undercover at meetings held right here in the United States. What she found out will horrify you. <br />I was on edge the entire time I was reading this book. It's as griping as any thriller and the description of her handsome young father's last days is almost too painful to read. I kept on reading because the suspense kept building.

Most of the PR implies that this is a roman a clef about those days. So far the reviews that I've seen in a least two major fashion magazines haven't been kind but that can be chalked up to fashionistas being annoyed with someone who mocked their world.<br /> Does the book live up to the hype? Yes and no. <br />It's an amusing book. The descriptions of downtown life in NYC, the side characters and the horrible antics of mean Miranda Priestly are fun but the heroine, Andrea is such a stuck up little snob that it's difficult to care about her. Margaret Mitchell was able to take a character who was an absolute monster and make millions love her. Lauren Weisberger doesn't have that kind of ability.<BR> <BR>What's really annoying is that the book has a choppy feel. Andrea lurches from one disaster to another with no transition in between. The plot has a formula that is an old as Greek mythology. The scenes with the best friend character, Lilly and the boyfriend, Alex won't surprise anyone. The climax is straight out of an old Edgar Wallace plotwheel. The ending was a sappy, predictable let down.<BR> <BR>The bottom line is this: if you love fashion and gossip The Devil Wears Prada will make you smile.

Ricciotti explains how Israel was structured, how Herod and the Romans ran it and the hierachy of the Israelite politcal and religious powers.

There is only one truly brilliant story in this collection: The Man in the Brown Suit. It chilled me like King's stuff always used to. The rest, except for Little Sisters is filler. <br />Everything's Eventual is also something of a rip off. Most of these stories aren't new to any regular King reader. Several are from his Blood & Smoke book that was supposed to be available only in audio form. This was a beautifully packaged disappointment.	2003-04-10

Alas, it wasn't the kind that the author intended. The France that she's talking about exists only in the movies now. Paris has high crime and housing projects full of poverty and anger. <BR>As for the delightful, French girl of the book, she's not that unique. The exact same things could be said of the most sophisticated and chic women in the world--New Yorkers.

I've been reading his books ever since so it's with sadness that I have to say that this is one of the weakest books he's ever written. King has announced that he's retiring. I was sorry to hear this but haaving read Buick I think it may be time for him to hang it up. This book is not scary so it fails. A romance book is supposed to be about love. A mystery has to have a central puzzle. A  horror book is suppose to have at least one good really good scare in it. Buick 8 doesn't live up to it's genre. <br />Buick is about a car from another world and the 20 years it spends sitting in a police barracks garage. Occasionally it spits out monsters and occasionally it eats people but that's about  it. Buick would've been a superior book if King has either skipped the supernatural and wrote a Shawshank type story or if he'd allowed the Buick to do more. We never learn the who, why or where of this car and the ending reads like King just got bored. Lump this in with King's other unsatisfying efforts like Dreamcatcher, Hearts in Atlantis, Bag of Bones,Tom Gordon, and Rose Madder.	2003-03-23

Steven Cojocaru looks like a chicken that has just undergone shock therapy and he's actually mocking other people's fashion sense. When I saw the cover I thought this was satire. Alas, Cojocaru is writing in all seriousness. <br />The book tells the story of how he, a nobody with questionable taste gets to interview celebs and mock them. Steven Cojocaru's life story isn't interesting, his gossip is stale and his observations aren't particularly enlightening. This book will be on the 99 cent rack in 6 months.

It has wonderful scenes, fantastic chapters and is so good in places and then she seems to get lost and goes on and on with fairly boring stuff. I can only assume that it was unedited. Also, she tends to play the wide eyed innocent too much. This woman worked in the White House and lives in NYC-- you can't survive in either place and still be a babe in the woods. The scene where she goes to Jack Kemp's party and behaves like a yokel was pure smaltz and sacarhine. It was laid on too thick--like a pool of jello and I didn't believe it. What I Saw at the Revolution was a much better book and it's one I go back to again and again.

The story of the Sammaritan woman is one of the most memorable of the New Testament and Obery M. Hendricks clevery brings the &quot;background&quot; story to life. The life of woman in Asia Minor was and still is, hard. Obery M. Hendricks makes you feel the heat, the sweat, and the daily indignities that a woman of that time faced. The Samaria of this book is very much like Segregation Era Mississippi and that's no accident, I'm sure. The brutality of the Romans, the joking conversations of the men, the bitterness of having to bow and scrape just to stay alive and the private feelings of the women are all very familiar. <BR>The only thing wrong with this book is the marriage of Maryam and Yeshua and the ending which strays just a little too far from the story of the Bible but those are small mistakes and the rest of this magnificent tale more than makes up for them.	2003-03-05

He's ticked off at the black women who  have done him wrong going all the way back to elementary school. I  have to say  that he has a point. There is a war going on between black men and women and it's destroying our community.The images of women in both rap and Hip Hop are revolting. Black women do share a responsibility for taking care of their own lives. He's right but he's so bitter it ruins the book.   <br />There is way too much cursing in the book. It get tiresome after a while and it contributes nothing. It was more like an 8 year old trying to shock his babysitter than a grown man with a serious thesis. 90% of the women in this book are sick, evil or nasty. Why does Maddox keep attracting such low quality women? He never figures it out. His reactions and his violent fantasies about paying them back was scary. There is so much rage in this book I couldn't help but wonder if Mr. Maddox is really the one to offer any constructive advice. It's rather telling that when he finally meets a truly praiseworthy, good, honorable woman he blows it.	2003-03-02

I grew out of it but reading Wife of the Chef makes me glad I did. The restaurant business is a tough one and only the strong survive. The author  talks about what it takes to get the business going and what goes into keeping it alive. Crazed waiters, drunken dishwashers, obnoxious diners are all part of the daily show. The pace that the author and her husband keep up is so tough that I got tired just thinking about it. <br />On the down side, Courtney some times comes off as being a bit too cranky and so much of a perfectionist that it must be very trying to work for her. <br />The best thing about this peek into the kitchen is the way that the husband, the chef was described. He's so endearing that I can overlook Courtney's apparently endless grouchiness with the rest of the world.	2003-02-16

This is most detailed Twilight Zone episode guide in print. It does a fine job describing the episodes and includes Rod Sterling's opening and closing lines. It talks about the behind the scenes history of the show and has vingettes on the most important of the show's writers. <br />There's only two things wrong with it. The author gives a totally uncalled for critique of each episode. His understanding of the Twilight Zone seems to be only academic because he doesn't seem to &quot;get&quot; anything nor does he seem to like any of the episodes that are considered to be fan favorites. <br />Secondly, he drops the ball on the Charles Beaumont section. He tells us that Beaumont suffered horribly from a strange disease and died at 38 (but looked and acted like a 90 year old) but after devoting pages to his story fails to tell the reader what Mr. Beaumont died of. <br />Until someone else writes a companion guide this book is it. I'll read the episode guides and ignore the snotty commentary.	2003-02-16

It's a brilliantly written book and up until the second half it's a funny one. Monk, the novel's hero, in a fit of anger writes a slang and stereotype laden piece of trash and is horrified to see it sell better than anything he's ever written before. <br />On one level, this is a book that any author could relate to. Why do garbage books always seem to be in the top ten best selling lists? It's easy to become bitter and Monk does what many authors have only fantasized about. The book starts out as a satirical hoot then its gets serious. It's very hard to put comedy and drama together and the effect here is rather like throwing a bunch of rocks into a jelly mold. When  Percival L. Everett gets serious the book sinks under the weight. I wish he could've kept it funny throughout but it's still a remarkable book that slyly pokes fun at the publishing industry.	2003-01-31

She's tough to survive to violent attacks with her wits in tact and she's vital to the success of the mission. <BR>Moonraker shows the reader more of Bond's day to day life than the previous book, I didn't even know Bond had his own secretary. The movies combined Miss Ponsonby and Miss Moneypenny into one character.

So why did he give it all up to walk into the Alaska wilderness armed only with a bag of rice? Instead of beating eaten immediately by a polor bear or a pack of wolves he was found 4 months later, having starved to death.  So what was Chris McCandless? Was he a Darwin Award winner? Was he crazy or was he simply a romantic young fool? The book never really tells us and even the author can't make up his mind. All we really know is that in Alaska a young man's boyish notions ran smack dab into cruel reality. <BR>It's an interesting book about an endurring mystery.	2002-12-29

Instead of another dog figure Margaret Hodges has created a man who loves his child and wants to do the right thing, even if it means sacrificing his own happiness. In the name of love and duty Rick makes some terrible decisions but the author made me see why he made them. I want to see more characters liket this.  <br />Dajah, his love interest really didn't catch me. She's so frosty and it takes so long for to warm up it didn't seem likely that a love story would get started. <br />The character of Gina left me annoyed. Must even baby's mama in black fiction be portrayed as a [bad], money grubbing, man draining tramp? Yes, Gina is the problem but she was presented as more of a [model] than as a human being. <br />Ultimately, this book is a mixed bag.	2002-12-29

Several of the agents I've contacted have moved or are longer in the business. It has some very good features such as the advice section but I could've gotten the same advice for free from the internet. As other reviewers have noted there is an easier and cheaper way to get writing information. Pick up a book that is similar to the stuff that you write. Go to the dedication or thanks page and read it. Many authors thanks their agents and editors. Write down those names and track them down. It takes more time but it's easier on your pocketbook and will probably be more accurate. <br />Next year I will by the Writer's Market book instead.	2002-12-29

For ghost hunters this is a pretty useful book. If you don't believe in ghosts and are merely intrested in spooky tales you can skip it. No pun intended but this book really could've used a ghost writer and a no nonsense proof reader. There are spelling and grammar errors and in places the writing is repetitive, and goes off the subject.  Try Dixie Ghosts by Chris Coleman as an alternative.	2002-12-29

Deal with it and keep on reading because this is going to be fun. <br />All of Fleming's books were fast paced fun but Russia stands out among them. The characterizations are brilliant. The description of the vicious and dreadful woman, Rosa Klebb goes on for more than a page. By the time Flemming is finnished you KNOW this woman and you're afraid of her. Tatiana, the beautiful innocent caught in a web of lies, Kerim Bey, the tough half wild head of T branch and psychotic Irish giant, Red Grant are all beautifully brought to life. The Russian scenes are written with such tautness you'll wonder how anyone survived life in the Soviet Union with thier sanity in tact. <br />If you're used to the Bond lite presented by Roger Moore' in his last two films or Pierce Brosnon's version, the Bond of the books will be a surprise.

One is quite interesting and good, the second is dull and the third is rushed and poorly done. When Carter is talking about upper class black life he's good.

Instead it got one of the most impressive ad campaigns in recent history. Hype is powerful and can make a bestseller but it can't make a so-so book great.

Later--much to late--in the book we find out why Winnie is such a mess but by that time you'll no longer care. People don't behave normally in this book. The characters make speeches instead of having converesations and the plot wanders all over the literary map. Is this a take on Christmas Carol? Is it a Jack the Ripper story?

Staniece Anderson went from middle class college girl to a hard core, junkie and not only  lived to tell the tale but found God and sobriety. <br />The chapters on her rape at 14, the terrible abuse she recieved at home and her distant, almost absent father show that drugs were not her only problem. Today Ms. Anderson has been drug free for 17 years. She's a writer of unusal talent and grace and has completely turned her life around by Faith. <br />The word \\"inspirational\\" is overused but that's exactly what this beautiful book is. Whether your life is as bad as Ms. Anderson's was or if it's mired in a different kind of misery this book will change the way you see things and if you pay attention to what it says, it will inspire you to change your life. Five stars is not enough. Staniece Anderson has written a ten star book, at the very least.	2002-11-24

Toby Young came from England to live in NYC and work for Vanity Fair. In short order he turned into a drunk, drove away friends, offended just about everyone at work and got fired. It's actually quite funny in places. Young was a self absorbed, shockingly boorish fool and he admits it in the book.  On his very first day at Vanity Fair he shows up to work wearing jeans and a T shirt with a vulgarism on it. It never once occures to him that this might not be a good idea. Watching him stumble blindly through Manhattan's VIP land is amusing and horrifying at the same time. The only thing really wrong with this book is Young's inability to really understand why he blew it in NYC. There is a bitterness in this book that clearly shows that Young still doesn't get it.	2002-11-17

I've read about Della Sutorious in the news and saw her story on the Discovery Channel so I knew this is a fascinating case but Aphrodite Jones buries under minutiae. There is no way she can know what was said word for word in private conversations so why give the reader pages of it? It seemed like book padding to me. <br />Della/Dante is a twisted monster but Ms. Jones actually managed to make me feel almost sympathetic towards her, which I'm sure was not her intention. The neighbors, in their recollections of Della all seem envious and nosey. The Sutorious children, especially the  eldest child are portrayed as whiny, selfish brats and the victim is shown in the most unkind light possible. I think the author became so caught up in her fascination with the killer she forgot to portray the crime and how it was it was exposed by forensic science.  This book was a terrible let down.	2002-11-09

Christopher Coleman is a talented writer who tells the tales with a fresh new spin. I particularly appreciated the sympathetic treatment of African Americans and Indians in his version of the classic ghost stories.

The heroine is a light skinned black woman who is the widow of a white man. A new love, a black man this time walks into her life and shakes it up. Love, race, class and family expectations all SHOULD make for a riveting novel. It doesn't work out that way. The heroine is too weak and pliant for my taste and the romance just didn't ignite.

Although the tone of the book is lighthearted and fun, the author obviously did his homework. He explains LOTR and The Hobbit by answering questions that new fans have. Why are Tolkein's elves so tall? Where did the idea for hobbits come from? How old is Gollum anyway? He tells how Shelob the spider came to be (Tolkien was attacked by a tarantula as a small child) and what Gandalf really is, and so much more.<BR>The reader will learn that LOTR is heavily inspired by Beowulf and Norse mythology. After reading this well written and amusing book I have decided to re-read LOTR. I now have even more respect for J.R.R. Tolkein. This book is actually a respectful tribute to him and his genius.	2002-10-30

A  decade later it seems rather tame. Why did Burke write it? He seems to have no rancor against Kennedy and admits that everything Teddy did, he tried to outdo so the question is never really answered. The portraits of Joan Kennedy and Rose Kennedy are gentle, almost tender ones. The best part of the book is when Burke gets out of Kennedy's bedroom and starts talking about the political goings on behind the scenes. The chapters on the failed 1980 campaign and Kennedy's relations with the Carters are fascinating.	2002-10-27

Either you like the sad, beautiful type ala Interview With a Vampire or Spike and Angel from the Buffy universe or you get something from the Stephen King mold. I prefer King's vampires. Kurt Barlow and any of the night creatures from Salem's Lot are mean, feral and cunning. They don't suffer from angst and they don't spend time on philosophy. <br />Salem's Lot is a pleasant little town with a nasty underbelly. There is embezzlement, gossip, wife and child abuse, and alcoholism going on behind closed doors. King does such a good job describing his townsfolk, both the heroes and the lesser villains that you almost don't notice when the long, heavy box arrives at the old Marsten house. Once the vampire is loose things move very quickly in this book and you will go for a roller coaster ride. King makes you love certain characters and breaks your heart when he kills them off. The book raises so many emotions but best of all it scares the reader. You can not read this book at night without being unnerved. This, along with the Stand and the Shinning is King's best book.	2002-10-27

The author was by his own account, not the best friend of JFK Jr. It isn't a great or even very good biography. The author also, can't seem to explain why he wrote it. This book, alas adds nothing to history and seems more like backstairs gossip than anything else. It's Kitty Kelly without the clever writing. Even if you collect Kennedy books this is not a must have.	2002-10-20

Yes, there are no &quot;on screen&quot; appearances by monsters and there is no crazed slasher in the book but it is extremely scary. There is something mean and undead in Hill House and Shirley Jackson wisely did not allow the reader to see it fully. Instead she cleverly hinted and allowed both poor, disturbed Eleanor and the reader to guess. Does the house call to Eleanor or did she choose it? Is Eleanor a victim or has she finally found where she really belongs?  This is a horror and pyschological suspense classic and I can't think of anything better to read on Halloween night.	2002-10-20

She's fat, her 4th husband has just left her with a mountain of debt, she's been fired and almost everyone from her mom to her best friend thinks it's all her fault.

Although it doesn't sound like it at first this is one of the funniest (not smiling funny but laugh out loud funny) books you will read all year. <BR>I can't believe this is Chris Burks's first book.

Instead we get the story of pitiful Ottile, who in real life was imbalanced and probably carried on the affair in her own head rather than real life. The chapters on Anna Douglass, however are superb. This is a tender portrait of a woman who loved a man who, despite their marriage, never really was in her grasp. My only real gripe is the on the final paragraphs of the final Ottile section.

Sounds like a rehash of \\"Christine\\", right? Wrong. \\"Buick 8\\" is nothing like \\"Christine\\". The Buick is from another world, maybe even another dimesion. Christine was definitely from hell. Ned Wilcox is grieving but he's no high school loser, like Arnie Cunnigham. Christine deliberately destroyed anyone who messed with her or Arnie. The Buick occasionally eats people who just happen to be around. So enough about Christine.<br />\\"Buick 8\\" is quite different from Steven King's other works. 90% of the novel is told in flash backs and by several different people, living and dead. The book gets off to a slow start, (this is deliberate, I think),smacks the reader with great big gobs of horror and then pulls up to an abrupt end. <br />As usual King takes ordinary folks, puts them in a hideous situation and makes the reader care about them. The good, the bad and the pathetic are all lovingly portrayed. I loved Curtis Wilcox, I liked Sandy and pitied George and Eddie and Mr.Dillon (especially Mr. Dillon). My major complaints were about young Ned and Arky, both of whom seemed a bit overdrawn to me. My only other real complaint has to do with logic. In all the years that the monstrous Buick sits in Shed B and after witnessing all the ghastly things it could do why didn't any of the troopers try to destroy it? <br />I enjoyed Buick 8 but it didn't thrill me or keep me up all night. It's a very good book full of great characters and incredible scenses but it doesn't have the same power or magic that King's earlier books had.  Still, it does entertain and I'm sure it will be appreciated by Stephen King fans both old and new.	2002-09-27

Then hurry up and buy this wonderful anthology. In the entire book there is only one clunker of a story and it is short. It starts with Dean Koontz's \\"The Black Pumpkin\\", one of the most frightening short stories I've ever read and rolls onto to end with \\"Porkpie Hat\\" which is simply remarkable. How Peter Staub could write so realistically about black life before the Civil Rights era is almost supernatural in itself. Another stand out is \\"Heavy Set\\" a story that when I first read it at 13 I didn't understand. Reading it again as an adult I finally got the hideous point Ray Bradbury was makinng. The stories are laced with essays on the authors favorite Halloween memories. Some are tragic, others a little sad and several were quite funny. <br />Whether you like unabashed gore, or cool,subtle horror there is a story in this book for you.	2002-09-26

The book surprised me. It is another of the new urban street novels but it's not a clone. If you read the ghetto fairy tale True to the Game or B-More Careful then Reason is the book for you. It's better written, edited and plotted than both of those books and it makes sense. Pam aka Carmen is done very well. I couldn't agree with her decisions but the author shows why she made them. The ending was sad but realistic.  So, is this book as good as Coldest Winter? No, Sistah Souljah's crown is still firmly on her head but unlike True to the Game and B-more, Let That Be the Reason is good enough to be in the same category.	2002-09-22

She takes a job working for an organization that serves the elderly and immediately starts falling over dead folks. The author does a fine job portraying old people and draws a believable potrait of the city but the book's message is a heavy lead weight. <br />There was way too much preaching about assisted suicide, and religion. Clea's character is a delight but it was extremely unrealistic, in a city like New York where everyone is obsessed with race that no-one has a problem with Anita and her husband Benno's adoption of her. This is going to be my last Anita Servi book. When I sit down to a mystery, I expect to be entertained, not lectured or bored. There is a lot of good in this author's writing but someone ought to tell her that in fiction  it's more important to tell the story than to advance a social theory.	2002-09-22

It gets boring in places and there are way too many transition scenes. I found myself having to skip pointless sections. <br />Antia's character sometimes annoys. She's too smug and a little too self righteous. At the climax she does something that makes no sense at all--something that no reasonable New York woman would even think of and that almost ruined the book for me. <br />Also, it occasionally gets preachy and that's not what I pick up a mystery for. The plot is clever, the side characters are very well done especially Clea, Miss Elizabeth and Miss Catherine. Marcuse's black characters come off as humans, not stereotypes and I appreciated that. She also does a fine job of caputring the West side of NYC. Will I buy another Anita Servi book? Maybe but I'll check the reviews first.	2002-09-19

Jane is rich and lives in what should be paradise but her friends are nuts and thanks to her super busy, competitive and secretly fearful mother, Jane doubts herself. Then she gets Silver.

Thanks to him, she finds out what love is, and who she really is. Powerful stuff. <BR>Of course, love like this can't last and defy anyone--even if you don't like Sci-Fi or romance, not to be moved at the climax of this book.

Rogers wrote the Five Black Presidents--that was a landmark work. This book is not. Let me explain why. First, Dr. BaKhufu's feelings about whites mars the book. She can't stop letting her anger intrude on the narrative. Second, she makes a lot of mistakes that would be insignificant by themselves but put together make the book look bad. First, Thomas Jeffeson was born in Goochland County, not Coochland. His boyhood home was Tuckahoe, not Tockahoe. Sally Hemmings was not auctioned off; she was set free by Martha Jefferson and allowed to stay in Virginia with her sons as free people by an act of the state legislature. Robert Lincoln was predjudiced, not predjudice...The author really should've gone to a proofreader and fact checker.<br />Several chapters are simply weird. The author's poems and even a herbal remedy for hoarse throats are scattered throughout the book and she goes off on these wild tangents. One minute you'll be reading about Abe Lincoln, and in the very next she's accusing Eleanor Roosevelt of being a lesbian.  The sad thing is that the book doesn't settle down and get serious until the middle. The section on Harding, who probably had black ancestry is very good. The chapter on Eisenhower is pretty good but other than a picture of his mother there is no credible proof offered that he was black.<br />As a black person and a historian I know that the truth of history is often not what we were taught in school. Lies have been told about black people and our contributions to this country but that doesn't justify making up a mythos of our own. So, to sum up I have to say that this book doesn't cut it as serious history (except for the Harding section) but it does do one thing: It makes the reader curious about J.A. Rogers and his books.	2002-08-31

Blaze is different and his teachers and school psychologists have called him everything from retarded to autistic to having attention deficit disorder. This book is about Ginsburg's fight to save her son from being labeled and stuck away in special ed classes. The book is about love, Ginsburg's family is still in her corner and it's about hope, there is still no  telling what Blaze will be like when he grows up.

It's part biography--and a fascinating one at that-- King's childhood was NOT one you'd want for yourself and looking back on it, it's no wonder that he writes horror today. It's an honest look at his joys, and sorrows and his former addictions. The second half of the book is purely about writing and it sometimes goes wildly against the advice you may have gotten from your Fiction 101 college course. King talks about inspiration, magic, genius and tells the brutal truth about bad writers. He charms, infuriates and challenges. I have read this book several times and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be a writer. My only quible is the quality of this paperback. It's fine if you are only going to read the book once or twice but if you intend to use it as a manual you'd be better off buying the hardback or the more expensive but sturdier quality paperback edition. <br />Kimberley Lindsay Wilson	2002-08-12

The trials of Spunky young Faulkner, evil queen bee, Joyce and loving Margaret will keep your interest and in a few places you'll even laugh. So why do I feel such mixed emotions about this book? The underlying attitude. Ms. Spencer seems to think there is only one way to be black. We know immediately that one character is a bad person becuase she wears a hair weave. When this character gets rid of the weave, the reader is given to understand that she is \\"okay\\" now. Another character looks and dresses like ordinary black women all over America and she is presented as a figure of fun--not to be taken seriously by anybody until she stops dying her hair, cuts her nails and puts on a business suit. The nominal heroine wears her hair natural and listens to Nina Simone---that supposedly means that she's got herself together. This kind of stereotyping really annoyed me. <BR>On the other hand Ms. Spencer does a wonderful job with characterization. I loved Margaret (the real heroine of the book) and felt more and more concerned for her health with each page. I loathed Joyce and cheered on Faulkner. If you can ignore the quiet lecture on \\"correct\\" blackness that runs through the book you'll enjoy it.	2002-08-05

The first half of the book could be skipped over completely. It's full of trite platitudes--something I've never seen in a Jakes book before. We all know that Bishop Jakes has an enormous compasion for women. This compassion has led him to overdo it in this book. I've known and been friends with women from Africa, Asia and a few Arabic countries. Compared to the ordianry misery of their lives America women live like queens. Most of our unhappiness is self inflicted. Jakes makes the life of a busy American woman sound like one long prison sentence. Come on now! Let's get real. <br />The second half of the book is better. Jakes finally gets to the point but it's not great either. His example of Rahab, the prostitute is disturbing. Rahab was saved because she saw the light and turned her life around. Jakes, makes it seem as though she was saved because she was merely willing to take a risk that the Hebrews were the winning team. I found myself grabbing my bible and comparing it to what Jakes was saying and I found his book wanting. This is a nice book but if you need real Christian answers (which are not always sweet and will not always make you feel good) then this aint the book for you.	2002-08-04

Although it's billed as  a horror novel most of the ghostly aspects are implied rather than shown.  The hero, Alan is a difficult young man. He's old before his time, priggish and smug. He's redeemed by one thing: his love for the gorgeous Karin. She is reduced to poverty by the aftermath of the war. In the name of love (or was it security?) a crime is committed and the in the name of justice it's  paid for. This really isn't a great love story.....you are never really sure if Karin loves Alan or if she just, as many women did at that time, wanted to get out of Europe. Is Karin a victim or a cold hearted monster? Adams can't quite bring himself to tell the reader what he thinks. This book has some exquisite moments and some embarassing ones (the sex scenes are all ridiculous) and it never really settles down. Is this a ghost story, a novel of obsession, or a love story? Girl on A Swing tries to be all of it and succeeds at none of it.  I will say that I learned quite a bit about porcelain so it's not a total loss.	2002-08-01

Earl Mills, knew her as well, if not better, than anyone else and his book does a fine job in telling the reader why DD was so tragic. The humiliations, the anger, the stupidity that she had to put up with from Hollywood and America are all spelled out without going into hundreds of pages. The story of DD's ghastly marriages and her retarded daughter were quite moving. This book is respectful of DDs memory and is clearly written by a man who loved her and was able to see the real woman behind the star. Frankly, I enjoyed this far more than I did the huge minutiae laden book by Donald Bogle.	2002-07-17

She's frank about these things and her family's experiences with racism and snobbery. On the lighter side, she's not ashamed to admit some of the foolish things she did as a girl.

This coming of age story will touch you. Johnnie Mae's baby sister was drowned in the Potomac. Johnnie Mae and her family live in segregated Georgetown. Racism is alive and dangerous. Johnnie is afraid that her parents blame her for Clara's death.

This book goes a long way toward making you see Mary as something else. Is this the real story? Perhaps or perhaps not. This is historical FICTION afterall. The real Mary not only outlived her brilliant siblings but managed to find marital happines. It's a fascinating story and well told. My favorite Boleyn book is The Concubine by Norah Lofts.

First the good, Little Sisters of Eluria is downright creepy. From the moment Roland the gunslinger arrives in town with a sick horse you know things aren't going to go well for him. Even non Dark Tower Fans will enjoy this. The Death of Jack Hamilton shows once again that King is the master of the old fashioned 1940s noir style crime/jail story. The Road Virus Heads North builds up tension so fast you  really have no idea of how it's going to end and it has a sly poke at some of King's nuttier fans. The Man in the Brown Suit was terrifying. Anyone who ever had an unpleasant childhood encounter with a strange adult will find it unforgettable. Everythings Eventual is terrific until the climax. Kings personal political feelings got in the way and that led to a somewhat weak ending.<br />Now for the not so good news. If you're a King fan you've already  read Riding the Bullet, Luckey Quarter and All that You Love Will Be Carried Away . You've probably already bought the Blood and Smoke tape and the L.T. tape. These stories all came out last year or so. It's too soon for them, as good as they are, to be in a written collection. It made me feel like King was just padding the book.<br />There was one clunker in the collection and it's the one about the highly unlikable middle aged woman who slips into her own private vacation hell. Luckily this one is very short.<br />Was this King's best collection. Nope. That honor probably goes to Nightmares and Dreamscapes or perhaps Skeleton Crew but it is enjoyable and if you're a serious King fan you've got to have it.<br />Kimberley Wilson	2002-03-22

If you are familiar with Harry Knowles from viewing his website then you've already read most of the stories in this book. If you are a fan then you'll buy the book regardless of reviews. If you aren't then skip it. Mr. Knowles obviously loves movies to an almost alarming degree but there is nothing really orignial in this book. Is Hollywood turning out garbage? Yes. Critics have been saying that since the silent movie era. Are the stuidos more interested in making a quick buck than producing great films? Yeah, of course they are. Not one single observation that Knowles makes hasn't been made before by better writers. The book is a little too slick, a little too cute and way too long.

The writing has style and it moves along quickly.<br /> I asked bookstore clerk who was buying this book and was told that it was mostly young boys--teens and college age kids. To all the young male readers I have to say don't take this book seriously. Have a laugh but don't make it your bible. The author places all black women into 4 catergories. That is way too simple. He portrays all poor black women in an extremely unflattering light that is neither fair nor factual. He also defends pimps as nothing more than clever businessmen. Go to any hospital on a Saturday night and watch all the prostitutes who come in with injuries caused by their pimps or  read the facts on child prostitution. Real pimps aren't nice guys. Ultimately, treat this as a joke book and buy it strictly for it's humor value.	2002-03-08

Books	3	15	15	N	N	not bad at all	If you are a serious fan of CSI or if you are fascinated by forensic science then this book might belong in your collection. The author actually has a degree in the subject so she really knows what she's talking about. The good points about the book are: You get a quick overview of how crimes are really solved. It's not by the flashy cop like in the movies it's by the CSI person in the lab. The author liberally sprinkles examples real life crimes and how use or misuse of evidence affected the outcome. For instance she shows how the JonBenet Ramsey crime scene was ruined and why the coroner will never be able to get an approximate time of death. She also mentions the O.J. Simpson case. Poor handling of physical evidence turned the tide there.  The only objections I have to the book are the design problems. The brittle paper feels horrible... your visible fingerprints will be left on it... frankly for the cost of this book I think the publisher could've made a better looking product.	2002-03-08

Perhaps I just picked up the one weak book in her collection. Debora Green is an unpleasant woman and a killer but it's clear from the start that Ms. Rule's personal feelings about her have adversely impacted the book. From the first chapter there is a long litany of Debora BAD and Mike GOOD language. Even Debora's youthful looks are described as coarse while Mike's are called fine and delicate. Appearance doesn't dictate character. I tired of the saintly presentation of Mike. No-one is THAT perfect. Rule doesn't even try to explain why Debora was so angry at her husband all the time. Finally when I got the page were Rules criticizes Debora for &quot;wasting her mind&quot; reading novels and yes--true crime books I had to put the book down. <BR>Bitter Harvest has a huge amount of nicely done descrpition but it's too lopsided.  A hideous crime was committed and two children are dead. I have to believe that the story behind their deaths is more complicated than the simple version presented in this book.	2002-02-25

It was a fascinating forensic study but this book fails to show that. Instead, it offers long (HUGE) passages of dialouge. Dialouge that the author can not really know happened word for word.

We know nothing of his childhood. His father's name is mentioned only twice and his mother does not make an appearance in the book until it halfway over.  This man was obsessed with hookers and strippers. He was an accomplished con man who stole from his wife, his mother, his friends and acquaintances and was getting away with it.

Shakur's public image was of an out of control thug but his poetry shows an intelligent, educated and even sensitive mind. A genuine American poetic talent has been lost. Even if you would never in a million years listen to Shakur's music give this book a try.You'll be surprised at how much you'll enjoy it. <br />Kimberley Lindsay Wilson, author of 11 Things Mama Should Have Told You About Men.	2002-01-26

Many of the readers have probably never seen early photos of free and even prosperous proud ante-bellum black people. I would give this book five stars were it not for the commentary. Jackie Napoleon Wilson tries so hard to interpret the photos that he makes ridiculous assumptions. There is no way to know what was going on in these  people's heads. As other reviewers have pointed out, becuase of the daugeretype's long exposure time the man in the photo on page 3 didn't just get caught in the scene he must have been posed. When Wilson says the woman and daughter on page 13 didn't have a close attachment he's speaking nonsense. How on earth can you tell that?  Despite the commentary this book is a worthy addition to the bookshelf of anyone who is interested in history.	2002-01-26

It is well written and intersting. By looking at each Presidential mother the reader will many times have a better understanding of the son. The author doesn't sugar coat anything.Many of these women were incredibly galant, good or bold but others were poor or ineffectual mothers. The author mentions gently, that Franklin Pierce's mother had a drinking problem--and so did Franklin and talks candidly about the smothering domineering ways of FDR's mother.

No. As Paula has said repeatedly in each edition of her books, you dont' have to agree with her.

Now, with Lady First she is free to set the record straight.<br /><br />She explains fully for the first time why she really left the White House and although she clearly adored Clare Booth Luce she's now free to show that working for her was no picnic.<br /> Also, we get a superior picture of the author herself. Bold or pushy, if you prefer she charted her own course and made  her own dreams come true whether it was to get herself to Paris or into the CIA or to be the first American female tourist in Yugoslavia after WWII.<br />If you think of Leticia Baldrige as just being the etiquette lady or  you only remember her from her White House stint then this book will will show you an entirely different side.	2002-01-08

Michael Hall is an annoying kid, and since he's the main character, the one we are suppose to fear for and identify with that'a flaw. He's supposed to be a preteen but reacts and behaves like a little boy. The womenfolk in this book are all ineffectual victims. There's suo much oddness and death in this town it's ludicrous that the cops and a possee of social workers don't make an appearance. The single most interesting character, including Nathaniel is Amos the grim grandfather who was not above killing to fulfill his vision of how things ought to be and he's one of the bad guys.

The Hippogriff, the Red Cap demon and the house elves who populate the Potter series all come from European or Eastern folklore. Nagini, the evil snake companion of the evil Voldemort is taken from ancient Indian myths. The centuars in the Forbidden Forrest come from Greek mythology. Hagrid the half giant can trace his literary lineage back through centuries of English and Irish tales. The more you read this book the greater your respect for J.K. Rowling will be. She obviously studied Brittish folklore before she sat down to write. Thanks to the Companion I now know that Nicholas Flannel and his wife were real people and that Flannel was a well known alchemist in his day who claimed to have created a Philosopher's stone. Using this historical figure in the her first book was a brilliant stroke. If you are fond of folklore this is the book for you. If you haven't read the Potter books becuase you thought they were just for kids this book may make you curious enough to pick one up.	2001-11-26

This aint a fractured fairytale but it is a fascinating book that stands apart from the author's previous work. The heroine Winnie is a difficult woman. She's made bad choices, and suffered a heart breaking loss that turns her in a Scrooge-like figure. No real friends, no family except one step cousin in England and a talent for disliking people. Like her ancestor, who is believed to be the model for Scrooge she has completely shut herself off from happiness. Like Scrooge she's haunted. This book is at times deeply offensive, sometimes funny and it has some real moments of classic terror. Lost is a perfect title. Winnie is lost, it seems that her cousin John is lost and lost boys figure very strongly in the plot. I started reading this book at 9 AM and finnished it around midnight. The ending is not strong enough by any means and was so sublte that I felt let down.	2001-10-31

The heroine Eve/Lynn/Kit Kat is a fascinating and complicated woman. You see why Stuart and Simon go to such lengths over her. She is both more and less than the image the two guys have of her. I laughed all the way through this book. It's rare that a writer can produce a book that's funny, touching and totally &quot;real&quot; all at the same time. The ending is a huge suprise.

I adored the movie Moulin Rouge and the soundtrack is one my favorite CDs but the book was a great let down. I was hoping to find a written explaantion of how Moulin Rouge was made and to see pictures from this glorious film. Instead it seems more like an overpriced graphic novel. The fact that there is not one clear photograph of either Nicole Kidman or Ewan McGregor is ridiculous. Hopefully some one else will write a real book about the making of the film.	2001-10-27

My only criticisms are about the sudden shift to the secondary romance between the two supporting characters. Their romance seemed to be contrived and I skipped over the chapters that were wasted on them. Also, the problem of Malcom, the no good son is never answered. Did he decide to grow up?

The gardens pictures reminded us both of my grandmother's garden. The book doesn't just show garden pictures though. It explains why Black gardens tend to look the way they do. I always thought my grandmother kept a dirt front yard because nothing would grow there. The book explained that this practice was a common method of controlling the bug population. I'd reccomend this book to anyone who loves gardens or has an interest in anthropology.	2001-08-04

It's a little too worshipful  and is far too sweet and is a good argument for why the best biographies tend to be written years after the subject's death. Deaver is so deep under the Reagan spell that the book reminds me more of an old 1940s MGM biopic. It's glossy, heroic and there are no warts. I found Peggy Noonan's book What I Saw At the Revolution to be much more realistic.	2001-08-03

Thai, the protagonist is like a lot of young black men growing up in the inner city. He's never been anywhere but his  own 'hood and only dimly realizes that there is a world beyond that. Not until he escapes to North Carolina do the chains on his mind loosen. Dark is a pretty  good first book. It's perfect for  teens who think they know it all and young adults.

First, the heroine is smug and self righteous. She has no convincingly strong motivation to find the killer other than curiosity. The victim wasn't interesting enough for me to care who killed him. The author had an incredibly annoying need to describe in detail what exact shade each black character was and she spent way too much time talking about the heroine's and everyone elses clothes. The one thing I did enjoy was the roman a clefs. One character is clearly meant to be John Johnson of Ebony Magazine. I won't be buying anymore Alex Powell mysteries.	2001-07-30

The experience was a huge awakening for Graham and is the major part of the book. <br />But don't overlook the esays that make up the rest of the work. &quot;Dinner with Mr. Charlie&quot; is pricless. If you are black and want to eat in NYC you must read this one. Graham went to several well known New York restaraunts and reports on how he and his guests were treated. The next time I'm in New York I won't be eating in any of these places! &quot;The Harlem on My Mind&quot; essay is heartbreaking as is the &quot;Black Man with a Nose Job&quot; piece. Graham keeps beating his head against an inmovable barrier. Despite his education, nose job and fine career he isn't and can't ever be a &quot;member of the club&quot; and that's the one fault of the book. I kept hoping that at some point he'd conclude that being a member isn't worth the pain and humiliation but he never does.  It was a satisfying read. At turns it's funny, pitiful and maddening. I rushed out to buy Graham's next book, Our Kind of People as soon as it hit the bookstores.	2001-07-15

You will watch with horror as Jack Torrance goes totally insane, you will feel both pity and irritation at Wendy Torrance and you'll cheer when Dick Halloran starts his rescue mission.   Killing a child character &quot;on stage&quot; was something a horror no-no until King broke the &quot;rule&quot; with Cujo and smashed it with Pet Semetary and It! and you will fear for young Danny's life. On a side note, The Shinning was one of the few books written in the 70s that let the black character survive!	2001-07-14

Most of them are very frightening. &quot;The Bogeyman&quot;, which I first read when I was 12 will make you think twice about leaving the closet door open at night was especially good. &quot;Strawbery Spring&quot; has a horrifying twist ending and &quot;I am the Doorway&quot; has an echo 20 years later in King's book Dreamcatcher.  Read the introduction by John MacDonald and the foreward by King himself. In light of what life was to throw at King in later years both are fascinating.	2001-07-12

Whenever King does a prison story you know it's going to be special. The Mile is one of the saddest most heart breaking novels King has ever written. I defy anybody who reads it not to hope that there's some way John Coffey can be saved. Is there  horror? Oh yes.

Only King could take flatulence and belching and turn them in terror.  But the lovely moments are too few and far between. I wanted to love this book but I didn't. For the first time in my life I actually had skip whole sections of a Stephen King novel. The character of Kurtz, and the soldiers in general never came alive. Kurtz is just a stock villain--the crazy military man straight out of central casting. Duddits is too much like a remix of the ... character form The Stand. I kept expecting him to start spelling m-o-o-n everytime he spoke. The S weasels are very scary but the gray aliens are too much like the Tommyknockers. It's a very mixed bag. I'd give it 2 and half stars if I could. If you love Stephen King buy the book. If you've never read King before please don't pick this book as your introduction. Go back and check out the Shinning, Carrie or Salem's Lot.	2001-07-07

I promise you that your mouth will fall open at least once on each chapter because you will be shocked. Mr. Hamblin says what others only whisper in the privacy of their own homes. The book is harsh, but ultimately hopeful. It's funny in places and tragic in others. It's a well written manifesto of Mr. Hamblin's veiws. He's not trying to convice anyone of anything he simply lays it all out and tells the reader to take it or leave it.	2001-07-07

I'd give it three stars but so much missing. For example it could have discussed how to visit other churches. AME Zion is not the same as a Baptist chuch and neither one is the same as a COGIC church. I would have loved to found out what to bring to a baby dedication...it's not the same as a baptism.

Fawn Brodie doesn't appear to enjoy writing unsavory things about her subject. I'd say  the book is a fair and accurate one. The writing is so enjoyable.

Thomas Sowell's early family life was not ideal and eventually drove him out of his home while still in his teens. With almost no support from anyone young Tom propelled himself into night schoool, then college, graduate school and teaching. Sowell has called his life an odyssee and that's exactly the feeling you get from the book. It was a long and remarkable journey.	2001-06-15

It's enormously satisfying and raises many questions. Would Steven King be Steven King if he hadn't been such a sickly little kid? If he hadn't taken that first drink back in high school or if he hadn't married Tabitha Spruce what would he be now? On the craft section of the book, King offers solid advice that every would be writer should follow. Most books on grammar and dialouge are so dry you miss half the wisdom but King's book is laced with so much humor that you get what he's saying. I love Stephen Kings horror and I've read my copy of his non-fiction, Danse Macabre to bits. This is a great addition to my collection.	2001-06-12

How she goes from being a contract performer on a soap opera to a movie writer and producer is a fascianting story. I'd buy the book for this alone. The struggle to make the Sally Hemmings mini-series is another remarkable tale. Although I think the actress playing Sally was miscast,(I collect books on Sally Hemmings and the actress looks nothing like the description given by both whites and former slaves of Sally) and the addition of the  beating scene was unnecessary I enjoyed the mini-series. Ms. Andrews overcame huge odds to bring this story to the public.

We've all heard these stories. What makes Pulpit Confessions so amazing is that it's written by a minister. He's not justifying the behavior that he's describing he's just being brutally honest. Once you start reading it becomes obvious why he has to use a pen name.

The Samauri's Wife is really good at capturing life in the Land of the Rising Sun except for one thing:A samurai would've rid himself of a wife like Reiko. Her character is totally unrealistic. The average well to do Japanese lady of this time period did not behave like this at all. Historical fiction is one thing, fantasy fiction is another. <br />On top of this problem, the character of Reiko is annoying. Her prime function seemed to be to get in her husband's way. I found myself hoping that Sano would turn to the bald headed nun. The most compelling love story the book was between Sano's arch rival, the Shogan's second in command and his cunning new lover, Hoshino.

I just finished reading the Complete Idiots Guide to Getting Published and I had to say thank you. The book is clear, to the point and all my questions. Using the advice I've come up with a nice query letter and book  proposal. So far a few agents and three publishers have shown some  interest. I don't know if any of this will come to anything but I know I  wouldn't have gotten this far without this book.	1999-12-15

Gordon-Reed does a fine job presenting both the pro and con arguments and best of all she asks the question why is it so hard to believe that  Jefferson, like many many men of his class had a slave concubine? Why does  the idea that Jefferson may have actually loved Sally seem to horrify  Jeffersonian scholars? What was worse, owning 187 slaves or loving one?  Gordon-Reed's book raises questions not only about Jefferson and Sally but  about today's attitudes about race and class as well.	1999-10-03

This book was written by someone who is obviously sympathetic to Darlie. The boy's are almost a side  issue. Ye, Darlie was not popular with the media or the public but does that make her inocent? No. Out of all the  Darlie books this was the worst.	1999-09-19
