Important applications addressed in the book include Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) already used in cell-phones; radar and sonar signals; and others.  <br /> <br />This book is intended for use as a reference work for engineers and computer scientists as well as to serve as a textbook for a course in digital communications.  <br /> <br />The book gives a URL for a web site to be used for additions, corrections, and updating.

The United States has made some fundamental changes in its foreign policy as a result of the 9/11 attacks. These largely center around the almost unilateral decisions to change the governments of Afghanistan and Iraq. The United States had the power to do this, and exercised that power.  <br /> <br />It appeared unlikely that the US would get UN approval or a UN based coalition to work together. France and Russia were getting favorable oil pricing from Iraq in exchange for weapons and would likely veto any decision in the Security Council. The addition of numerous Islamic states into the General Assembly. So the decision was made to proceed anyway. It was certainly popular with the American people still operating in great anger after 9/11.  <br /> <br />Americans tend to believe with an almost religious fervor that our way is best, that the America system (under God) is clearly the way that the world should work. Americans believe that their global actions are benevolent, that the rest of the world is almost child like, and should look up to us as a father.  <br /> <br />The rest of the world doesn't exactly agree. The Islamic countries look at the US support of Israel and see a contempt for Islam. Europe looks at the US with some alarm. President Bush is often viewed as some kind of pistol packing Texas cowboy.  <br /> <br />Any book like this is a snapshot of the situation at a given time as seen by one person, the author. He certainly presents an interesting fview of other states worred about US dominance and who are starting to turn their concerns into action.  <br /> <br />It's an interesting book to read now, and it will be interesting to read in ten years or so to see just how a good a predictor Dr. Walt turns out to be.	2005-10-14

Reviewers all over the country wrote reviews about how great it was. The initial sales were fantastic. It went immediately to a book club. Published in 18 (last I heard) countries. That was in the early summer of 2005. Switch to early fall. I see lots of places with the book for sale saying 'Publisher's Overstock.'  <br /> <br />John Twelve Hawks, the author, supposedly lives 'off the grid.' That is, no permanent address, no credit cards, no Social Security number, etc. Question -- how does he get paid royalties? For the publisher to pay him, they are going to want to deduct that expense on their taxes. To do that they have to have a Social Security number, a corporate ID, or possible make the payment to a foreign national in their own country. It's still good hype to have the author remain quite mysterious - no interviews, no book tour, no e-mail. He communicates only through his agent via scrambled-signal satellite telephone. How is the satellite phone account paid for?  <br /> <br />Anyway, the story. This book, the first of a trilogy, sets up a fight between the forces of light and darkness that is happening behind the scenes, off the grid if you wish.  <br /> <br />The bad guys are the Tabula. They're sort of like the Patriot Act run amok.  <br /> <br />The good guys are the Harlequins - no they don't write romance novels. They run around with swords in what I envision as  a 'Kill Bill' environment and fight the Tabula.  <br /> <br />Inbetween are the Travelers who have an ability to project their spirit into other worlds where they can receive wisdom to bring back to earth.	2005-10-14

Books	5	12	26	N	N	A View of Combatting Radical Islam	Tony Blankley argues that the rise of radical Islamist jihadists poses a threat to the United States and an even worse threat to Europe. I would say that he believes that the threat of cultural warfare is the biggest problem facing out future. He asserts that too many politicians and journalists believe that our challenges are business and politics as usual and ignoring the real problems.  He also presents a view of the ultra right wing Christians that is rather refreshing. Basing our entire set of laws on books written in the middle-east a thousand or two years ago  doesn't seem to make an awful lot of sense.  <br /> <br />A lot of what he says makes a lot of sense. But a lot causes me trouble. One thing missing is the impact on the future world of global warming and the ending of a society, a culture, based on oil. Any predicition of the future that doesn't have an entry for oil in the index causes me concern. <br /> <br />I am also reminded of the old comment by Benjamin Franklin (also attributed to Thomas Jefferson) that 'He who sacrifices freedom for security is neither free nor secure.' Unfortunately his solution seems to me to require the sacrifice of several freedoms and I'm not so sure that they give us any more security.  <br /> <br />This book is well worth reading to see the thinking behind his proposals. If you agree with him or not is up to you, but this is the way that a surprising percentage of the people are beginning to think.	2005-10-13

The book is intended as a text for drama students with a wide collection of plays to be studied. The plays range from 'Oedipus the King' (first performed about 430 BC to 'How I Learned to Drive' - 1998 Pulizer Prize winner for drama. <br /> <br />This is the third edition of this popular book. In this edition the number of plays has been expanded to twelve (from nine) and the introduction has been expanded with coverage of Greek 'old comedy' and the theater of the absurd.

The man who gave the order on the carrier 'Yorktown' to turn on her landing lights after dark to give them a place to land was Jocko Clark. <br /> <br />That alone would justify reading more about him, but there is lots more. An indian, he went to the Naval Academy (Class of 1918) while the indian wars were a fresh memory. Early recognizing the value of aircraft, he became a pilot when planes were still wood and fabric. World War II came with the Japanese attack at Pearl. Getting rid of the battleships left the carriers and the aircraft admirals in position to win the war.  <br /> <br />Younger than the famous admirals of World War II, he was commander of the Seventh Fleet operating off of Korea. He lived through the transition from wood and fabric through to the time of the jets. Not just lived, he commanded.	2005-10-13

The newspapers are filled with a running count of how many soldiers were killed today and in total. As of now it's about 2,000, just about how many Americans are killed every two weeks on the highways. But that's not news.   <br /> <br />It's nice to see books like this come along once in a while. Dr. Coppola, pediatric surgeon was in Iraq working on Iraqi children. The title of the book says a lot, he made a difference for that one. That one baby, perhaps a casualty of the fighting, more likely a normally sick child, that one baby he could do something about. If you can read this book without a tear in your eye. And without feeling that we are indeed doing some good over there I will be surprised.   <br /> <br />It's too bad that books like this one which show the good side of a man, and of America will not get the readership, will not get the reviews in the New York Times that would make it a best seller.	2005-10-13

I'm sure the schools would never go for it, probably too interesting. Then again, do we really want today's kids (or probably yesterday's as well) studying poison?  <br /> <br />Note the title. This book is on the elements that make the best poisons - arsenic ... really good for your complexion but too much and you have a nice looking corpse, antimony, lead, mercury, and thallium, yes thallium a metal, ... sold in over-the-counter products as a treatment for ringworm in children. It was also used in an Agatha Christie mystery 'The Pale Horse' to remove unwanted relatives.  <br /> <br />Because it concentrates on the basic elements, it does not go into poisons in general. Nothing here about the blowfish toxin or that kind of this, this is a chemistry book, not biology.  <br /> <br />Once again, this is a chemistry book. But it's a chemistry book that is hard to put down. Great fun reading in a sort of macabre way.	2005-10-13

It required the development of this book that gives a good introduction to functional analysis for statisticians and an introduction to statistics for functional analysts.  <br /> <br />The book is positioned so that it can be used for both groups of students. This is a delicate balance that can teach introductions (graduate student level) to both fields without leaving the other half of the class bored. As such it is not a text on either subject, but is inbetween. The sections on statistics are written from a viewpoint familiar to the functional analyst, not from that of a mathematician. And the reverse is true in the sections on functional analysis. This is to complete the view of the two groups typically taking the class.  <br /> <br />This is a graduate level course, it provides relatively little background information to the basic mathematics needed.	2005-10-13

That single sentence pretty well sums up the intent, the intended audience, and the direction that this book takes.  <br /> <br />This is a new paperback edition that has been updated in response to customer input and with data updated to reflect happenings since the last edition. The bulk of the book hasn't changed that much, after all the basic concepts of what GIS can do for you and how to implement it haven't changed that much. To be sure the details of the available software have changed a bit, but the basic concepts have not.  <br /> <br />This is not a technical book on doing GIS, this is a book for managers that will tell him what can be expected from a GIS system and gives the manager enough information that he won't be snowed by the teckies implementing the system.	2005-10-13

It was called the cold war because not much fighting occurred. To be sure, there was some in places like Korea, Viet Nam and Afghanistan. And there were some time where the two superpowers faced each other over loaded weapons such as Berlin and Cuba. But all in all, this was the longest time since the Roman Empire that the two strongest countries on the globe didn't go to war.  <br /> <br />During much of this time the Military History Quarterly has provided a venue for the most prominent historians of our time to present articles on points of history as it was being lived. Robert Cowley is the founding editor of MHQ. In this volume he has selected articles from the Cold War period that serve to be a history of the Cold War written as it happened. The authors include some of the most prominent historians of that time, and some others that are not so well known but who provide an insight into the times.	2005-10-13

These homes are primarily older (as much as 300 years) that have been seriously redecorated to make them into jewels of plesant styling.  <br /> <br />For the most part, the redecoration of the homes has been to retain (or return to) the styling of the time they were built. Magnificant old beams show off well with modern appliances and decorations. The traditional outside of the houses hides the modern interiors. The original builders could not have imagined things we take for granted such as electricity that now has been fitted into their houses.  <br /> <br />Redoing an old house is easily as expensive as modern construction, so these houses have not been done for cost savings but for  other reasons like living in a part of history.  <br /> <br />While this book concentrates on this region of France, many of the techniques used in these houses could well be applied to houses in the United States where old houses be they farm or city center can be made into something unique and wonderful.	2005-10-11

This exhaustively researched book tells the story of each ship that was there from the 136 gun 'Nuestra Senora de Santisima Trinidad' to to the 30 (maybe 35) men on board the Armed Schooner 'Pickle.' (The 'Pickle' was smart enough to stay out of the way of the big boys and watch the battle. Afterward she went in to rescue sailors from sinking ships.)<br /><br />Each ship is described in detail, many with drawings made by the author for this publication. The history of each ship is given along with a description of what she did at Travalgar. Along with the history of each ship, there is a good bit of summary information about the three fleets. Carrying some 47,000 men these ships were the visible evidence of the most complex things yet devised by man.<br /><br />This is a beautiful book, and includes several pages of full color illustrations from paintings of the period, modern photographs of models of some of the ships, and current photographs of the preserved flagship 'Victory.'	2005-10-11

At the time there was little or no understanding of earthquakes other than their being acts of God. It wasn't until 1968 that the concept of plate tectonics began to be developed that explained not only this earthquake but the 'ring of fire' that circles the Pacific Ocean.   <br /> <br />Mr. Winchester is an Oxford trained geologist who approaches this writing with the knowledge of an expert and the eye of a novelist. This book is a story of how the San Francisco earthquake was the first to be a major media event. He starts with the story of San Francisco and the earthquake. He recreates the story through the experiences of selected witnesses -- scientists, laborers, businesmen and more famous people such as Enrique Caruso and Ansel Adams.   <br /> <br />Beyond the story of this particular earthquake, this really began the study of earthquakes and eventually to the development of theories explaining how they happened.	2005-10-11

The authors of this book has studied some 1,000 of the centuries business leaders that have made their companies into household names. They were attempting to find out what made these leaders succeed while others languished.   <br /> <br />One factor recognized by the leaders is something they call 'contextual intelligence.' This is an ability to understand the times in which they are working. Through this factor, they are able to direct their company to take advantage of the times. Bill Gates and Microsoft for instance came along at just the right time to capitalize on new personal computer market. There were other software companies with competing products, but they are now just part of the history.   <br /> <br />The business leaders that have succeeded so well are put into three general categories:   <br /> <br />Entrepreneurial Innovation - Here is Microsoft, but also Ford, Disney, Wal-Mart. This is the biggest category  <br /> <br />Savvy Management - Such as Alfred P. Sloan who took over a struggling auto company and made is a giant - General Motors.  <br /> <br />Transformational Leadership - Jack Welch who transformed GE from a faltering conglomerate into a powerhouse in selected industry segments.	2005-10-11

The women who have created the workspaces shown in this book seem to care about things like what color the walls are, what decorations are up. Probably even how clean the floor is.   <br /> <br />The art supplies stored in the dish washer (p. 49) is a lot more my style.   <br /> <br />The other thing that surprised me is how few computers are in view. I find that computers seem to multiply and there are at least a half dozen of them around, some in various states of disassembly.   <br /> <br />This book is interesting to see how these creative women have set aside an area in which to be creative, in which their choice of work style, work flow has designed a work space to suit their particular needs. And strangely enough, I don't think I could work in them.	2005-10-10

First came cellular telephone technology, and more recently wireless data applications. Second is the dramatic progress in VLSI technology which has enabled small-area and low-power implementation of sophisticated signal processing and coding. Third has been the success of the later digital wireless standards, especially the IS-95 Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) wireless standard.  <br /> <br />This book is aimed at a first year graduate school level course in wireless communication and is usually taught in the electrical engineering department.  <br /> <br />Virtually every aspect of sending a signal through the air is discussed from power, frequency, noise, fading, interference, and from a hardware standpoint the all important antennas including design, positioning,  reflections, and shadowing.  <br /> <br />This book is the most up to date available, and has been used in preliminary form at a good cross section of universities across the country.	2005-09-29

But even in this early time there was a need for transportation from San Francisco to the communities being developed southward. Before that time the only way to travel was by animal power, either horse or walking. The answer was an electric trolley system that began on Market street and ran down to San Mateo. This system continued to operate until 1949.  <br /> <br />This book is one of the Images of Rail series put out by Arcadia publishing. It is basically a picture book with perhaps 200 photographs of what was called the '40 Line.' The pictures are nothing less than amazing. It must have been a labor of love on the authors part to collect these pictures and put them together as a book. (As one indication of this, all of the proceeds from this book are being donated to the Bay Area Electric Railroaders Association.)  <br /> <br />While these pictures primarily show the sights connected with the 40 Line, the people, clothing, and backgrounds show a lot about life in those times.  The first pictures show horses on dirt streets. The last show the cars of the 1940's.  <br /> <br />This is a delightful book.	2005-09-29

But as the systems were developed and marketed security became less important than getting to market quickly and of course price. As a result, the seurity features built into the initial systems was fairly weak. While the home user typically didn't care about security, the enterprise user was very concerned. After security flaws were discovered and published the widespread use at the enterprise level was halted. The IEEE standards community completed the revision of the security related components of the 802.11 standard in 2004, and equipment meeting the new standard is just becoming available.  <br /> <br />This book covers the security aspects of WLANS, first discussing the initial designs and then how they were corrected in the new protocols.  <br /> <br />The last part of the book is on the 802.16 Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks which have the promise, or perhaps the hope of dramatically increasing broadband access in areas not covered by cable systems and at distances too great for DSL service.	2005-09-29

But I found myself laughing all the way through. Mr. Sanjuan was working at the UN in the 1980's. A good bit of his commentary is about the Soviet Union using the UN as a base for spying on the United States. I kept thinking that all this effort certainly did them a lot of good.  <br /> <br />And his comment abouting having to have the telephone directory, excuse me, the 'repertoire telephonique' having to be published in French since French is still the international lingua franca, sort of summarizes everything there is to know about France. <br /> <br />The UN was formed by the victors of World War II to prevent another World War II. It has no power of its own. The powerful countries of Germany and Japan were excluded from positions of power. The United States and the Soviet Union didn't want to give up any of their soverign power, so the UN was designed to be powerless. And so it remains.  <br /> <br />I think that the surprising thing is that anything gets done by the UN at all. Smallpox is probably their greatest accomplishment. It succeeded there because no one could object.  <br /> <br />The current Bush foreign policy seems to be to ignore the UN in most cases and to act in a unilateral fashion in areas that concern the US. While this seems to be annoying a lot of countries, it doesn't seem to annoy them enough that France agrees to a Europe that would be powerful enough to counter the US.  <br /> <br />As the real problems of the future (or what they appear to be now anyway) of Islamic (and perhaps Christian) fundamentalism and changing away from an oil based economy begin to grow, it will be interesting to see what happens to the UN.  <br /> <br />Like I said earlier, I really enjoyed this book. If I'd only known, I'd have tried to go to work there. It seems you could have lifetime employment with nothing to do, and no way to get fired.	2005-09-28

Perhaps you want to look at news stories and display the headlines of what's happening today with a link to the site of the story. In the early days of the web, when you wanted to do something like that you had to do it manually or do some kind of hard coding to parse the information you wanted out of the HTML. Tedious, and if they ever change their web page you're re-doing your code.  <br /> <br />This is the problem that RSS/Atom are intended to fix. These are standards that, when followed, present the information from a site in a standardized manner that makes it easy to parse.  <br /> <br />First, what this book is NOT. This book does not tell you all the details about how to put RSS/Atom information up on a site. Instead, this book is on taking the information from an RSS/Atom 'page' and getting into a form you can use.  <br /> <br />The book is broken down into three parts: Consuming Feeds, Producing Feeds, Remixing Feeds. In each part the author programs a few simple applications to show you what can be done. The programming is in Python, the operating system he uses is Linux.  <br /> <br />The only complaint I could make about this book is that it would help the newbie to have another chapter at the beginning that talked about some common feeds and the nature of the tags they use to encapsulate their data.	2005-09-28

This edition has been expanded to include additional coverage of Egyptian and Mesopotamian architecture at the early end, and the coverage of the architecture of the twentieth century has been greatly expanded. There is also expanded coverage of the architecture from Asia, particular that of Japan.  <br /> <br />The book now has 50 color and 931 black and white photographs. Most of these are from Europe, but the rest of the world does have some coverage.  <br /> <br />The increased size and scope of the book now presents a continuous coverage of the evolution of architecture from the earliest building, about 5000 B.C. to buildings constructed in the twenty first century. It is the most complete single volume history of architecture available and it's new edition is greatly improved.  <br /> <br />The author, David Watkin is Professor of the History of Architecture at the University of Cambridge.	2005-09-28

Instead the word comes from the Spanish word for 'war' which is 'guerra.' Adding the Spanish suffix for small and getting converted (not translated, just converted) into something easier for English speakers to say gives us 'guerrilla.\\"  <br /> <br />The word comes from the 'small war' that the Spanish irregular forces fought against the French -- Or did they.  <br /> <br />This book comes from talks given at a symposium on the Napoleonic period held by the School of History at the University of Liverpool.  <br /> <br />The research conducted by the speakers presents a variety of interpretations, some of which was determined more by location than anything else. In some places the French and the Spanish worked together to maintain a respect for private property, the church and the people and there was little fighting. In other places the French had little discipline and the Spanish fought back.  <br /> <br />Besides Spain the book talks about resistance in other countries such as Germany, Russia and other countries. The sub-title of the book is well chosen. In different places the 'resistance' was indeed patriots, partisans or land based pirates.  <br /> <br />This book opens an area of discussion that I've not seen before.	2005-09-28

It was his son asking why he was taught evolution in public school and creationism in Muslim school that caused Dr, Shanavas to research and then write this book. He sees it as lamentable that many Muslim imams have taken the psuedoscience of the fundamentalist Christians and are teaching it to their students. Likewise he laments that students in the sciences look at what the imams are teaching and begin to distrust or reject Islam.  <br /> <br />His studies took him back to the Qur'an itself and further into the teachings of early Muslim scholars to come up with a view that evolution is an intelligent design in its own right. It was (I have to say 'may.') have been set up by a higher power to manifest His omniscience, supremacy, and grace in a universe constructed with creatures of limited free will. ==The rejection of science by the Muslims has to be a major part of why the Muslims, on a world wide basis, are so far behind the western countries. <br /> <br />This book certainly presents a view different from the fundamentalist Christians. It is to be hoped that our Government can see enough to take other religious views into mind when crafting legislation. We do have a fundamental tenant in the separation of church and state.	2005-09-28

The Bear basically invented college football as we know it today. Before him, it was a minor thing, something that was an afterthought to the atheletics program. Afterward, it became big business.  <br /> <br />This book is more about football and the changes that made it big time than it is about the personal life of the Bear. To be sure it covers his life from it's start from small town Arkansas to Birmingham.  He gives his early life as a player then working his way up the chain to Head Coach for the 'Crimson Tide.' It was a life of football. <br /> <br />The author, Allen Barra is a native of Alabama, he grew up with the stories, the atmosphere, the legend.

It should be no surprise that when printing was invented, the first document to be printed in volume was the Gutenberg Bible. Then as radio and subsequently television became available so did the religious use of the new media. With each advance the ability to communicate expanded in volume and shrank in cost.  <br /> <br />It should then be no surprise that as the new electronic media became available the churches began to take advantage of the new possibilities offered. As Catholic Archbishop Chaput said, 'For us to miss the opportunity new technologies give us to preach and educate and inform would be harmful to the mission of the church.'  <br /> <br />This book discusses research on how religions have used the Internet and e-mail to expand their ministry. And how individuals have used these same media to find what they seek in religion.	2005-09-28

It helps you to analyze and define what are your security needs. Determining your needs before you start to look at solutions can be a real cost saver.  <br /> <br />Second, it looks at the various types of systems that are availabe. This includes prepackaged systems that are basically turn key operations. It compared the offerings from several vendors to make vendor selection your choice rather than restricing yourself to one offering.  <br /> <br />Third, it looks at the solutions you could build yourself, either independently or in cooperation with one of the established vendors.  <br /> <br />Finally, it covers what you might call 'living with the system.' This includes testing, day to day use, maintenance.  <br /> <br />This is a general introductory book that covers virtually every aspect of building and using a security system for your house. If this is something you are planning to do, it will provide enough information for you to make intelligent decisions.	2005-09-27

This is a profession in the midst of drastic change as new technologies emerge. No one yet knows what the internet is going to do to publishing. As you read this, you are getting the information that was published on the net, displaying it, and reading about a book published using olf fashioned dead trees. In spite of the changes, the industry published a record of about 175,000 new books and revised editions in 2003. The industry is growing, particularly among the publishers who fill small niche markets. This is causing a demand for people in virtually all aspects of publishing.  <br /> <br />The book concentrates on those jobs that are unique to publishing. The people in more general professions from accounting to janitorial remain the same in the publishing industry. The book has chapters on:  <br /> <br />The Writer  <br />The Literary Agent  <br />The Editor  <br />The Book Designer  <br />The Sales Representative.  <br /> <br />It gives a very good summary of these jobs, including such sage advice as just because you are writing, don't quit your day job. You can only say so much in a book describing an industry, you don't know how much detail to include. This is an excellent first introduction.	2005-09-27

The basic story is of Claire, a time traveller from the twentieth century going back to the mid seventeen hundreds. If you've already met Claire and Jamie the long wait for this book is now over. If you are new to them, then you have a true delight awaiting as you dig in. To save you the time of having to look them up, the previous novels are:  <br /> <br />Outlander,  <br />Dragonfly in Amber,  <br />Voyager,  <br />Drums of Autumn,  <br />The Fiery Cross,  <br />Lord John and the Private Matter.   <br /> <br />This particular story takes place in 1772, during the very early phases of the American Revolution. The question is how would you act if you knew that in only a few short years the colonies were to begin a vicious war. The story line revolves around several strong characters with a background of love and war. The historical settings are surprisingly well researched.   <br /> <br />Good characters, good writing, good history; what more could you possibly want.	2005-09-27

The format has been to invite a combination of chef's or celebrities to the kitchen on the set of the show to present a favorite recipie or two. In this book, the best of these recipies have been put together in book form for the benefit of the T.J. Martell Foundation to fund research into leukemia, cancer and AIDS.  <br /> <br />Because of the wide range of people appearing on the show, the recipies vary across all kinds of specialty foods. This even includes traditional American fare such as Apple Pie. Of course when they cook polenta, you need to remember that this is just a fancy word for good old southern grits. The Valencian Paella (Spanish, not Mexican but from Spain) is excellent, as is their Chicken Satay (Thai).  <br /> <br />The range of skill level required to take advantage of these recipies ranges from the complete novice to quite experienced cooks.  <br /> <br />Often in cookbooks you get the recipies from one person. And often these sound very much alike. In this book, the wide range of authors allows each of them time to select just a few of their favorites. It's a good idea book when you're pondering what's for supper.	2005-09-26

But it seems that writers can't seem to stop writing. And over the past few years Mr. Vonnegut has written a number of short essays that were published in various place.  <br /> <br />In this book twelve of these essays have been collected together. I guess you can't say the Mr. Vonnegut has written another book. He just did some writing and Daniel Simon has put them together in book form.  <br /> <br />The topics of the essays are varied, from the joy of doing a simple task (going out to buy an envelope and mail a letter) to the fire bombing of Dresden, from running out of fossil fuels to the state of the earth.  <br /> <br />At 82 years old, it's clear that Kurt Vonnegut has not lost his sense of humor, his ability to see wisdom in ordinary actions. The book is a delight to read.	2005-09-26

It turns out thought that the Dutch, who were building an overseas empire that would rival that of the British also issued letters of marque (Dutch - commissie van retorsie) that  gave their ships the right to act as privateers to attack the ships of eneny countries. And as was the custom with the British and French privateers, some of them found that their weren't enough enemy ships so they broadened their range to become outright pirates.  <br /> <br />In this book, Virginia Lunsford, a professor of history at the United States Naval Acadamy describes the story of Dutch piracy and privateering in an excellent bit of original research.  <br /> <br />One strange aspect of Dutch pirates is that a surprising number of them retired back to Holland after their career as a pirate and lived with a certain esteem  and respect. This was in spite of the existence of laws that specifically outlawed piracy and prescribed hanging as the penalty.  <br /> <br />This book not only gives the history of Dutch piracy in narrative form, but has several appendicies that give specific detailed information on individual ships and the results of their cruises.  <br /> <br />This is a pioneering work covering a subject I've not seen covered before.	2005-09-26

Images enable a doctor to view the inside of the body in a manner that gives him useful information he could never decipher out of the raw data. With the increase in the demand for images, so has the need for information on digital image processing.  <br /> <br />This book begins with the image sensor and continues through the programming techniques that are applicable . This includes both processing the image for automatic analysis (fingerprint or facial feature analysis), or presenting the image for human evaluation (a digital camera). The book is primarily interested in still images rather than video.  <br /> <br />The early chapters in the book are oriented to the basic technology of image processing that are used in virtually all applications. This includes a chapter on color imagry and others on the mathematical tranforms. Later chapters are broken down more to application areas such as biomedical, and satellite sensors and imageries.  <br /> <br />Finally the last chapters discuss image compression to minimize image storage space and transmission times. This includes a full discussion on the new JPEG 2000 standard. One of the authors, Dr. Acharya was a member of the committee developing this standard.  <br /> <br />This book is suitable for use as a text in a formal setting, or for the individual who may be interested.	2005-09-26

When your father dies on a karaoke stage it's bad enough, but when you then find out that he was (or had been) a god it's pretty funny.  <br /> <br />Then there's your brother, the one you never knew you had. But of course he now shows up. You combine all this with a bit of mystery, a ghost, a little romance and bit of British wit to get this story. This book is set in the world of his previous book, 'American Gods.' That is to say that it's not the same set of characters, but it is set in the same kind of environment.  <br /> <br />The book has the same feeling of normal life, but then the gods get involved and strange things seem to be happening. This book seemed to me to be a bit lighter than Americna Gods, more humor, easier reading. I enjoyed it very much. <br /> <br />Mr. Gaiman is certainly a productive person with the books, the new movie (Mirrormask) coming out and more. I expect we will see a lot more from him in the future, and I guess that we'll just have to wait.	2005-09-25

In the play the Southern representatives agreed to support the Declaration only if words prohibiting slavery were taken out. Politics is the art of compromise, and without the Southern states there would have been no Declaration. So slavery was left in.  <br /> <br />In the time of Roosevelt the Southern politicians had enough clout to stop all of the New Deal legislation if it were made truly color blind. As is often the case, it took a politician from the affected states to force legislation through the Congress to right this wrong. Lyndon Johnson had been in long enough that he truly understood how to get what he wanted through the congress.  <br /> <br />In this book, the author explains how nominaly racially blind legislation and programs were in fact deliberatly and subtly were able to exclude blacks from participation. He uses this to make a plea to eliminate poverty and inequality in America.	2005-09-25

It would be expected that such a divergence would create a lot of different food and cooking styles, and it has. In this book there are 188 different recipies as well as an explanation of Arab culinary traditions. The recipies have been collected from all over the Arab world.  <br /> <br />Here is, for instance, a discussion on the several different kinds of rice grown in various countries. She cooks her rice a bit differently that I. First she prepares seasonings and oil, adds the rice and then adds boiling water. This is something that I have to try, and I'm going to try it tonight.  <br /> <br />The meet dishes are made with chicken, beef or lamb, pork is never mentioned. The meats are treated with a wide variety of spices that we do not use. I've only tried two or three of the recipies. Obviously I tried the ones that sounded most like something I would like.

And the more similar the schools (or countries) the stronger the rivalry. In schools they play football. With countries they go to war.  <br /> <br />But all of a sudden this doean't work any more. The Cold War never turned very hot. I've often wondered if this was because of nuclear weapons. For once, the old men can't sit around and send young people off to do the fighting. The old men, sitting in their capital building are just as much on the front line as the Grunt carrying a rifle. The longest stretch of time since the Roman era passed with the largest powers going to war.  <br /> <br />In this book, the authors describe a similar situation that seems to exist between India and Pakistan. After fighting several smaller wars, both countries obtained atomic weapons. Now they have avoided a war. Did the leaders suddenly realize that their own personal hide was on the line?  <br /> <br />Do you think that Osama would think differently if he was convinced that continued bombings might cause a mushroom cloud to grow over Mecca?	2005-09-25

In England during World War I, this worked entirely too well. The people of England decided that they were likely to be invaded and insisted on protection.  <br /> <br />The Government knew that any invasion would have to be huge and that the Royal Navy and regular forces would be adequate to resist it. But the public wasn't convinced and the Volunteer Force was created.  <br /> <br />At a time when the regular army was being greatly expanded, official equipment was in very short supply, the 'Dad's Army' had to make do with whatever was available. Transportation was often by bicycle. Motorcycle units were formed when the soldiers brought their own motorcycles - a spare parts disaster. Those were just part of the problems.  <br /> <br />This carefully researched book tells the story of these 'forces.' It's the story of an army that never fought.	2005-09-24

I don't know what defines and intermediate or advanced user, but this is certainly not a beginners level book. You'd best have quite a bit of experience in Photoshop before you tie into this one.  <br /> <br />Why a Canyon Conundrum? Because pictures of the basically brown canyons of the American West just don't look like those same canyons to to our eyes. He starts with a picture of 'Artist's Palette' in Death Valley. Artist's Palette is a canyon where there is a lot of different colored dirt. When you look at it, you see green dirt, purple dirt, etc. You remember it as being a lot greener than it actually is. And you want the photographs to match the memory not the reality. LAB to the rescue.  <br /> <br />This canyon is a good place to start, and he follows it with several other canyons to illustrate what LAB can do. This serves as a good introduction to the capabilities and from there it's on to working with lots of different kinds of images from faces to locomotives, from landscapes to a rose.  <br /> <br />As I said, not a beginners book, but an excellent book on color processing.	2005-09-24

Film and books have given us an image of World War I as being a bloodbath in the trenches where every available body from all of the companies involved were fed into the fight. John Hughes enlisted in the Canadian Army and was sent to France expecting to be in the infantry. Unbelievably when he got there he found that he was surplus to their needs.  <br /> <br />'Hughes,' he was told, 'I want you to start a kitchen garden for me.'  <br />'Yes, Sir. Where will you have it.'  <br />'Oh, wherever you find room.'  <br />'How large do you wnat it, Sir.'  <br />'Oh, make it large enough to supply potatoes and vegetables for a million men.'  <br /> <br />And he did.  <br /> <br />For three and a half years, Major Hughes was the Agricultural Officer. He farmed using ill and injured cavalry horses and recovering wounded men. While doing this, he wrote a letter to his wife back in Canada nearly every day. This book has been put together from these letters by his grandson, John R. Hughes. It tells a story of World War I that is dramatically different than what we are accustomed to seeing.	2005-09-24

If it had worked, there should have been no poverty left in the world, democracy should have developed everywhere, and the whole world a better place to live. Needless to say, it hasn't worked out that way. Instead we are seeing countries facing massive amounts of debt that will never be repaid.  <br /> <br />Dr. Rosberg is a Canadian living in Belize. This book reflects what he has learned from his years of observing and working with developmental projects. He says that for a project to be successful, an individual's self-interest (which he calls greed) has to tell him that doing these things will be beneficial to him. Dr. Rosberg says that the sterile debates of morality associated with wealth generation have to be laid aside. This is a pragmatic book that looks at the world of developing companies as he finds them, not as something abstract as might be viewed from an ivory tower.  <br /> <br />This is an interesting point of view that looks at modern problems in a way that almost relates back to the work of Adam Smith many years ago.	2005-09-24
37218:US	50776149	R24NS7DYU6N7F5	0072262125	351819332	Networking: A Beginner's Guide, Fourth Edition	Books	5	24	25	N	N	A Good Place to Start	Note that the sub-title of this book says that it is a Beginner's Guide. It is designed for people who understand computers and have some experience in using operating systems such as Windows, Mac, or Linux. It starts with this base and talks about how to interface these systems into networks.  <br /> <br />One thing that I like about this book is that it starts with an overview of what networking is, how the company will benefit, what the goals of establishing a network might be. From there it goes into the types of networks, i.e. peer to peer, client/server. I often find that this overview, what should be the first 40 pages or so of the book, is missing. Here Mr. Hallberg does an excellent job of providing the basic understanding of 'this is what I'm trying to do.'  <br /> <br />After 38 pages (not quite a full forty pages, but close) he begins to get down to the nuts and bolts like cabling, repeaters, hubs, switches, and firewalls. From there he goes on about like you would expect to more advanced topics until the basics of networking are pretty well covered.  <br /> <br />One particular strong point is the chapter on Network Disaster Recovery. You're going to have a disaster, it's just a matter of time. Having a place to at least start looking for how to recover is very good and not common in beginning level books.  <br /> <br />One point I would like to see more of in a beginning book is security. Windows XP has some security features built in. A discussion of using their firewall vs. a hardware firewall would be good. And some discussion of keeping the salesmen out of the accounting package would be nice. Perhaps in the next edition.  <br /> <br />Conclusion: A Very Good Place to Start.	2005-09-23

In South Louisiana where I grew up it was rice. Consequently I never really liked Italian food because everything seemed to come with pasta. It was several years that I visited Northern Italy and behold the restaurants served rice instead. It was wonderful.  <br /> <br />I spotted this book. The cover photograph looked an awful lot like a Spanish Paella, a favorite of mine. I started flipping through the book. I haven't found out just which dish is on the front, because I can't seem to get all the way through the book. I keep finding things that I want to cook.  <br /> <br />First I couldn't get past the first page of the risotto section. Risotto Saporito al Gorgonzola -- Gorgonzola, a blue cheese that's one of my favorites --Pinot Grigio, a dry white wine that's one of my favorites. There's no point in going any further until you try this recipie. After you get to a recipie like this, why go any further until you've tried it.  <br /> <br />Then, only a couple of pages later, Risotto Giallo con Peperoni -- saffron, you can never go wrong with saffron in a dish. Garlic, onion, peppers, wine again.  <br /> <br />And Risotto alla Moda Dalamata.  Lean beaf, Italian sausage, veal, cognac - need I say more. <br /> <br />Well, I'm going to keep working my way through the book. Maybe I'll find what's on the cover, maybe I won't. It no longer matters.	2005-09-23

Worse, she dies at an early age and of suicide. The remaining brothers gather and have to understand that they are facing a future with a loss that will be there forever. Further there are the practical problems of the youngest brother remaining at home, and of their father slipping deeper into mental illness as he ages.  <br /> <br />The family is very well described, not the ideallic loving family that we all would want, but the normal dysfunctional family made up of people with their own problems, agendas, and history.  <br /> <br />Ms. Forkin has written a book that shows unusual insight into the way families work. This appears to be her first book, I suspect that it will not be her last. She is likely to be an author of reknown in the coming years.	2005-09-23

His work spanned the full range from spectacular houses, to churches (both small and St. John the Divine in New York City), to the university campus (Rice, Princeton, West Point). This book is the second in a two volume biography (the first volume is called Boston Bohemia, 1881 - 1900). It covers from 1900 to his death in 1942.   <br /> <br />Compared with most biographies, this book is profusely illustrated. There are some 130 photographs and drawings included along with eight pages of full color plates. These are of Cram's work, the churches, houses, buildings that Cram designed. Noticably missing are the usual pictures of his father and mother, wife and kids. The author understands that the story of an artchitect is in the things he designs, not the old, musty looking family members.  <br /> <br />This will almost certainly remain the definitive biography of Cram.	2005-09-23

The smell of the still drying paint, the echo's from unexpected sources and more now have an impact that wasn't there in the plans.  <br /> <br />This book consists of two essays:  <br /> <br />The first surveys the historical development of the eye-centric orientation of our Western culture that began with the Greeks.  <br /> <br />The second begins to lay out a way towards a multi-sensory approach to architecture that forms a sense of belonging and integration.	2005-09-23

Now in its 7th edition, this book has been revised and updated to be include the new information being used in the new PMP exam that is starting on September 30, 2005. This book has proven to be the standard by which others are compared. It's very layout is different, more structured toward the material that is need for the exam. This is combined with the details behind the answers to the questions, right next to the questions so that you don't have to go looking through another book to find what you want. The mathematical formulas are included in with the text in a manner that makes them easy to pull out. <br /> <br />At 500+ large pages it is not a small book, but then again, it isn't a small test. It begins with some background information. Simple things, but things that might prohibit your even taking the test, i.e. take your elgibility letter with the authoriztion number on it, a photo ID and two other forms of ID.  <br /> <br />Of course you must meet the education and experience requirements, but other than that, everything you need to know is here in a clear, concise manner. The book includes several practice tests, with answers so you will know if you are passing. One of these is on the CD. The publisher maintains a separate web site for us in conjunction with this book that has much additional information.	2005-09-23

Books	5	21	21	N	N	Moving a Musical to the Big Screen	Being an observer of plays and movies with a particular interest in musicals I've long been puzzled by the difficulty there seems to be with moving a musical from Broadway to Hollywood. Why does a smash hit like Gypsy, sometimes called 'The best damn musical ever,' basically flop on screen?  <br /> <br />Darcie Denkert is an expert on both Broadway and Hollywood. In this book she has carefully researched a series of the most famous musicals that were made into movies. Sometimes, like with Gypsy, the play simply doesn't translate into the big screen. The scene at the train station, for instance when Rose is shifting her attentions to Louise after June left in the play works well. The train station doesn't look like a train station, it looks like a set. The orchestra is visible, the song works. In the movie, at a real train station, you don't just burst into song. And the stars, great movie stars, just didn't fit.  <br /> <br />This is the kind of information that only an insider with a foot into each camp could get and then put into a book. Referring to Gypsy again, the author also tells us how the stories got written, who did what, how did the music get written, what did they do in the screenplay to adapt it?  <br /> <br />The book covers 6 big plays: My Fair Lady, West Side Story, Gypsy, The Sound of Music, Cabaret, and Chicago, and 8 smaller ones. This format gives all the space that is needed to completely tell the story. Gypsy, for instance gets 38 pages, and they're big pages. To we outsiders, not plugged into either Broadway or Hollywood, this is an absolutely fascinatin book.	2005-09-23

The mathematicians were concerned with procedural processes where the mathematical techniques were asimportant, if not more so than the resulting formula. The physicists, on the other hand were concerned with using that formula to describe what's happening. Now the situation is even worse as computers have come in to allow the use of numerical techniques in many areas of physics that can be treated in a completely different by the mathematicians.  <br /> <br />There seems to be a trend to develop math and computer science courses to be taught in the science departments. This is the course in math to be taught by the physics department. It strikes a nice balance between procedural math and cookbook physics.  <br /> <br />This is the third edition. It has been updated based on feedback from requests. There is also additional information on the use of personal computers. She points out to students buth the usefulness and the pitfalls of computer use in most topics.	2005-09-23

Proteomics seems to be entering mainstream cancer research, but it is still a new research area and relatively few researchers have any training or understanding of the procedures, equipment, approaches or techniques.  <br /> <br />This brand new book (July 29, 2005) brings together articles from some of the pioneering researchers in the field. These articles cover everything from setting up a laboratory to the bioinformatic processing (including identifying appropriate software packages and their vendors), and reports of several areas of current research. <br /> <br />Dr. Liebler is a researcher at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. The authors of the individual articles come from a wide range of respected schools and institutions. This approach of using various writers was used to keep the information contained in the book as current as possible.	2005-09-22

They required entirely too much arithmetic to be useful before the age of computers. But with computers the whole concept of fractals became something that could indeed be studied.  <br /> <br />A bit of time goes by and all of a sudden the people doing fractals begin to discover that using the right kind of mathematics can be used to produce a lot of images that begin to look like things in nature. These drawings began to look like things such as trees, mountains, clouds, explosions. And all of a sudden there was an interest beyond those of the mathematician just drawing cute geometric patterns, it's called game development.  <br /> <br />This book is not on gaming, it's on the basics of fracticals. It includes software to generate fractals, and it gives the mathematics of how these fractals are created. It's a basic, beginners book to computer graphics at the mathematical level.	2005-09-22

This is a lot like the military uses schools like Top Gun to teach warriors how the expected opposition fights.  <br /> <br />The book covers virtually every aspect of how a computer works down at a low level in the software. It starts off with a discussion on the registry. It goes on from there to the network, the e-mail server, the web, and common approaches to hacking such as 'buffer overflow.' He then goes on to discuss the common virus programs and how to combat them.  <br /> <br />Hacks into systems are generally based on bugs in the code. Generally accepted guidelines say that there are 5 to 50 bugs per thousand lines of code. Windows XP has approximately 40 million lines of code -- That says somewhere between 200,000 and 2,000,000 bugs in XP alone.  <br /> <br />This book will teach you what hackers are doing, the legal aspects, the damage done and most important how to avoid your own systems getting maliciously hacked. It is not intended for the beginner - when you're reverse engineering binary files or investigating what's happening with the stack your're pretty deep into what's happening in the system.  <br /> <br />This is the most complete, most detailed book I've seen on hacking.	2005-09-22

It is intended for both self study and for formal classroom use.  <br /> <br />Java is increasingly be used as the first language to be studied. It is not only a powerful language in its own right, but has the ability to quickly and easily put graphics on the screen without the work necessary to create separate windows. The browser handles this part allowing the program to do it's own thing.  <br /> <br />One thing I particularly like about this book is its treatment of objects. So many  Java books start talking about objects in the first page or two, stringing together a bunch of words that absolutely no meaning to the beginning student. After this, the word object tends to not be mentioned for a hundred pages or more, by which time the student has completely forgotten the description. This book takes a more incremental approach. It starts with simple applets, increasing the size and complexity as the student progresses through the chapters. Objects com in at chapter 5, about the same place as in the other books, but having skipped those first confusing words.  <br /> <br />The CD-ROM is designed to be used with Windows (sorry Mac Folk). It contains the source for every program in the book, as well as all of the figures  used.	2005-09-22

I'm writing this as Hurricane Rita is headed towards the Gulf Coast somewhere. Hurricanes happen. They come in all along the Gulf Coast. Katrina came in to New Orleans, well, actually it didn't hit New Orleans but the high water came. (Politicians don't like to spend money on things like maintenance of the levies.)  <br /> <br />Now comes Rita. Last night Rita was headed to Galveston. A million people left. Now Rita is projected to hit somewhere quite a ways east of Galveston. The western side of a hurricane is usually beautiful weather. The million people will decide that they shouldn't have gone through the effort (a normal 2 hour drive took 12 hours). Over the next few years the whole thing will have faded into the past. Ten years from now, another hurricane will come in that way. People won't leave.  <br /> <br />Dr. Siegel says that our fears come from three sources:  <br /> <br />The Government - if politicians can create a crisis and then fix it ....  <br />The Media - the hype about Rita today is nothing less than fantastic.  <br />The Big Drug Companies - How many ads have you seen on TV lately about illnesses that you never even heard of before?  <br /> <br />Terrorism, yes it killed about 3,000 people one day in 2001. But we kill about 4,000 every month in automobile accidents. Why are we so concerned about terrorism (making airline flights impossibly difficult - go pay cash for a one way ticket and watch what happens to you) and there are no thoughts at all about making the cars and the roads safer?  <br /> <br />It's a funny world, and Dr. Siegel tries to bring a bit of sanity to our lives. I'd write more, but I've got to go see my doctor about this drug I saw advertised last night.	2005-09-22

To be sure, there were a few constants to be evaluated to a few more decimals. Then came 1905 and an obscure physicist published a paper that turned everything upside down. His name was Einstein. Among the things that was turned upside down was our understanding of time. It appears that the fundamental nature of time is very far fron what common sense would lead us to believe.  <br /> <br />This book has the simple intent of changing the way that we look at time. It discusses the latest theories to in a non-mathematical approach intended for the non-scientist. The concepts he discusses are at the leading edge of presently understood cosmology.  Perhaps understood is to strong a word, believed.  <br /> <br />Surprising to me is that the author has taught philosophy at Oxford for many years. As such he is willing to talk about things like time travel that the more doctrinaire physicists don't mention. Note that non-mathematical does not necessarily mean simple. These are not elementary concepts. Good Reading!	2005-09-22

It has since grown to a worldwide organization reaching some 110 million households. This is the story of EWTN, but more important it is the story of its remarkable founder and guiding light. <br /> <br />I am not catholic, so the discussions of the liberal vs conservative aspects of the church don't have a great deal of meaning to me. But the strength of her convictions, the life she has lived make her life one worth learning about. She has done a remarkable job of living a life.

If we still attend church, the critical few are repeated on an annual basis. And the common scripture readings again cover these moments.  <br /> <br />In this book these stories are again repeated. But this time they are combined with a historical view that helps to present a more human view of Jesus, one where we might can view what the man had to go through. In the section on the crucifixion for instance, he talks of how this was a Roman punishment. He adds understanding to the whipping administered beforehand. The Mel Gibson showed this most graphically. But the author points out that the condemned often died under this preliminary punishment, thus being spared the greater one to follow. <br /> <br />Of the crucifixion itself, the whole thing was designed to be as cruel as possible. Death often took two or three days to occur. Jesus was 'fortunate' in surviving only a few hours. And remember that in John, the people involved didn't want the event to continue so the soldiers were instructed to break the legs of the three on the crosses. This put all the weight on the arms and caused suffication to occur quickly.  <br /> <br />This little book provides a view that fills in background information to those told in the Bible	2005-09-21

Within a couple of pages the book has you opening a spreadsheet and making changes to it. If you have some spreadsheet experience, even just a little, then this book will take you a long ways. Far enough to get you to pass the Microsoft Office Specialist test. <br /> <br />Being a Microsoft book, this book is about using Excel in a Windows environment. Some of the information would be useful to Apple folk, but there are probably better books for them.  <br /> <br />When looking at Excel books, I first look to see what they have about Pivot Tables. In this book, there is an entire chapter devoted to them. This is something that the beginning user just won't understand but which will be very helpful to someone of intermediate level. There is even a section on Pivot Charts, something not seen very often at all.  <br /> <br />I didn't do all of the exercises, especially if I had a good understanding of that area.

But experience at universities have shown that while studying the X86 may be proper for a computer science major, the engineering student is more likely to be professionally involved with some other kind of processor of the microcontroller variety being used in some kind of embedded project.  <br /> <br />As a result, this book was developed along with a microcontroller based on the PIC 18 cpu. This microcontroller is supplied as a parts kit to be used with a prototyping board. It was discovered that supplying the student with a finished PC board led him to  thinking of the computer as a monolithic device. Supplying the kit of parts makes him think of the components and a more skilled engineer results.  <br /> <br />This is a slightly different approach to teaching microprocessors that would leave the engineering student more capable of doing useful work after school.	2005-09-21

Microsoft Project is a full fledged project management system that is fully integrated into the Microsoft Office environment. This means that the screen looks a lot like any other Office application. There are several versions of Project, and these are described to assist in deciding what to buy.  <br /> <br />Finally you get to the point where you have Project on your system and have gotten it started. The book then becomes a Step by Step tutorial. It explains what you are doing and why, and gives you a good understanding of why this particular bit of information is being required. As you would expect in a book this size, the book continues through all the aspects of project management reaching the use of Project Server where multiple inputs can come in from users throughout the organization.  <br /> <br />Of all the books I've seen, this is the one I'd recomment for the beginning user. There are some more complex reference books for advanced users, but this is the place to start.	2005-09-21

The once elegant stairways were now topped with chain link fence. The fence around the school yard was topped with razer wire. There were metal detectors at the entrances, just like getting on an airplane. How can you possibly learn in this environment?  <br /> <br />This book takes this change in schools to one chillingly logical conclusion where the schools are truly battlegrounds.	2005-09-21

Once voted the most beautiful woman who ever lived by the Guinness Book of World Records. Sometimes nicknamed The Face.  <br /> <br />This book is a compilation of photographs from her private collection. While the dates all of the pictures were taken is not given, they appear to be from about 1923 to perhaps the late 40's or early 50's. The pictures were saved by Garbo and shared with her family.  <br /> <br />Now as a celebration of the centinnial of her birth these have been collected together and mixed with short articles about her life.  The articles are not the important part of this book. It is the photographs. Even across 80 years she comes across as beautiful and sexy. The do not have the look of so many pictures of that time. Here the hair style, the clothing, the photographic style is timeless. The quality of the printing of the photographs is absolutely first rate. This is a beautiful book.	2005-09-21

The registry is that thing down at the bottom of the operating system that controls what the Windows XP operating system does.  <br /> <br />Thankfully the first part of the book starts out with pretty basic information like what's in the registry. Then it discusses its structure, and begins to define some of those cryptic things like HKEY_USERS, and a bunch of other HKEY's. At the very least, the information in Part I is of interest and probably something that any fairly advanced user should know.  <br /> <br />Part II gets into Registry in Management, this has chapters on Using Registry-Based Policy, Windows Security, Troubleshooting and so on.  <br /> <br />Part III, Registry in Deployment is on using the registry to set up individual systems in a broad based deployment.  <br /> <br />All in all, this is the most complete, best thought out book on the registry available. This is the second edition of the book on Windows XP, but it follows on previous books where Mr. Honeycutt described the registry on previous operating systems such as Windows 2000. His development of both understanding and the ability to describe that understanding is based on writing several previous books.	2005-09-21

The problem is that it's impossible to quantify a lot of things. (McNamara tried to use numbers for everything and we got the Viet Nam war.) There is a school that teaches that metrics are the only thing to consider. There's another school that says that metrics can't measure teamwork, drive, or as this book calls it 'makeup.'  <br /> <br />This book, by long time Braves following journalist Bill Shanks follows the Braves way of using professional baseball scouts as they go looking for players with the right makeup. The book is a series of anecdotes and stories that illustrate how the Braves do something that basically can't really be defined, that is, attract each year a stable of competent players, run them through their farm team system to keep a major league ball team supplied with competent players year after year.  <br /> <br />This book uses the Braves as examples because they use the scout system. It would be equally useful for other teams, but using one team as an example gives better consistency in a story. Highly recommended, especially if you're a Braves fan.	2005-09-20

This Michael Jackson is a consulting editor for Whiskey Magazine, and this book is a summary of years of study of what else -- whiskey.  <br /> <br />The first couple of chapters give a general introduction to whiskey. What it is, how is made, the stuff it's made of, just about every aspect. This section goes into pretty good detail giving the interested reader a pretty fair understanding of the whole process.  <br /> <br />The back part of the book, and by far the biggest part is called The Whiskey Countries. Beginning with Scotland, and then on to Ireland, Canada, The United States, Japan and the rest of the world he discusses not all of the whiskey's produced, but spends more time on the higher quality brands. I went to look at my favorite brands first, and they were all there.  <br /> <br />The problem with these 'best bourbons' is that they are sometimes very difficult to get once you go very far from home. Tomorrow a friend is coming to visit from Virginia. He has promised to bring a couple of bottles of Virginia Gentlemen Small Batch.	2005-09-20

Flies have been buzzing around for at least 250 million years. There are now some 150 families, with 150,000 defined species. Flies have been studied as long, if not longer, than any similar organism. There have been so many studies that it is difficult for individual researchers to gain a broad perspective on the organisms they study.  <br /> <br />This book is an attempt to bring together contributions from a diverst group of scientists in a single volume. The book is broken into three broad units: Phylogeny, Genomics and Developmental Biology, and Evolutionary Ecology and Biogrography.  <br /> <br />In each of these parts, leading researchers have written articles that cover the main areas where research is being conducted. Yeates and Wiegmann edited this collection and contributed one article of their own. The other articles are written by specialists in their particular area and have been peer reviewed by a distinguished panel of scientists. Each chapter ends with an extensive list of references that can be used for further study.  <br /> <br />This volume is the best single volume work that provides a general overall view of the subject that I've seen.	2005-09-20

By any standard the B&M was a nice little regional railroad. While the overall track mileage was much less than the big national roads, they made up for any shortcomings by the population density they served and by the willingness of the road to experiment.  <br /> <br />One task of the road was to provide commuter service in the area surrounding Boston. This called for self propelled cars, not unlike the commuters of today. On the B&M these cars could be electric, gasoline or diesel. They tried them all. Sometimes these cars were used as locomotives to pull a passenger car or two.  <br /> <br />The cog railway up Mt. Washington is one of the few (if not the only) like it in the country. The B&M even ran boats. And to keep pace with the times, in 1933 they began an airline using a Stinson trimotor - it was advertised as being well ventilated. In the cold New England winter that must have been brisk.  <br /> <br />The B&M was also in the resort business. They built hotels on the seashore and in the White Mountains and of course ran the trains to bring the tourists to the hotels.  <br /> <br />This is one of the Images of Rail series. The book is mostly pictures, probably about 200 of them collected together to provide a visual history of the road.	2005-09-20

There are a bunch of lose weight books on the market. They talk about diet, exercise, all the same standard things that we've all been taught about for years. In this book, Mr Montignac analyzes why the French people have the lowest average body weight per capita in the Western World. As you might guess from the title, it concerns the French eating habits.  <br /> <br />Most popular diet books will work if they are followed. Unfortunately most people either don't lose as much weight as they wish, or they quickly regain the weight lost when they go off the diet. This book, instead of pushing a regimen that probably won't be followed, presents an eating philosophy that invludes wine, chocolate, cheese, and red meat while you are losing weight.  <br /> <br />The essense of the French Diet is glycemic index, which measures the portion of carbohydrates that are converted into sugar inside the body. The book discusses this philosophy and includes some 60 recipies. And a lot of these recipies aren't bad at all. Shrimp with Green Peppercorns, for instance, is cooked in olive oil and wine. <br />cooked in olive oil	2005-09-20

One of the minor mysteries of life is why Paulo Coelho isn't better known in the United States. This new book is being published in 100 countries in 45 languages. It is the No. 1 best seller in 22 countries. His books are almost unknown in the United States.  <br /> <br />The Zahir, a Novel of Obsession is the new book. A Zahir (an Arabic word) means something that is visible, present and unable to go unnoticed. The story here is about a missing wife. The narrator is living in Paris when his wife Esther disappears in the Middle East. Also missing is her friend Mikhail, who may or may not be her lover. This is the background for the narrator to travel across Central Asia discovering more about himself than he ever expected.  <br /> <br />As this search becomes an obsession we learn more about the narrator, and in the end about ourselves. This is one sign of a good novelist. We are entertained by the story, but at the same time it forces us to think about ourselves; to learn, perhaps, something more of the world.	2005-09-20

How and why does someone become a terrorist? Are there common causes? Is there a terrorist personality?  <br /> <br />For the first time I've seen, a senior psychologist has approached the concept of terrorism with a view to trying to understand what makes the mind of the terrorist  work. Only with a greater understanding of every aspect of terrorism will we be able to work out the techniques that will enable the world to effectively fight it.  <br /> <br />The author has conducted research that considers terrorism as a process and exploring three distinct phases of the making of a terrorist: becoming involved, remaining involved (or being a terrorist), and then leaving terrorism behind.  <br /> <br />Despite the ongoing search for a terrorist personality, the most insightful and evidence-based research to date not only illustrates the lack of any identifiable psychopathology in in terrorists, but demonstrates how frighteningly 'normal' and unremarkable in psychological terms are those who engage in terrorist activity.	2005-09-19

There are two articles in this section, one is on the 'Psychology of Terrorists and Terrorism.' The article is written by Dr. Norman Itzkowitz. He is the aurhor, co-author, editor or translator of eleven books on Near Eastern or Balkan subjects. His discussion covers several aspects on terrorism from the views of the europeans, comparisons with previous terrorist operations from the Romans on, describes the organizations terrorist have, and so on.  <br /> <br />The last article is on a comparison between the present war in Iraq with the US War in the Philippines beginning in 1899.  <br /> <br />These articles originally came from the University of North Texas's annual Military History Seminar.	2005-09-19

In 1851, the legislature passed a law that all rails laid in Canada would be 5'6\\". This was to keep Yankee domination of the railroads from happening. The fact that you then couldn't send a car from Toronto to New York wasn't important. This lasted until the 1870's.  <br /> <br />Canada's narrow gauges came from two sources. One was the 'British Metric,' not really metric, but 3'6\\". The other, more common in the west was copied from the very successful D&RG of Colorado which used a 3' gauge.  <br /> <br />There were some 17 narrow gauge railways in Canada. Generally speaking they were in areas where the narrow gauge meant significant savings in construction costs. The tighter turning radius meant that a lot less earth had to be moved in mountains.  <br /> <br />This book is a loving collection of the pictures and stories of these railways. And lest you think of narrow gauge as something of the last century, there is a great picture on page 115 of a diesel engined train leaving a tunnel and crossing a bridge. What makes is to great is that everything in the picture, the tunnel, the bridge, the engines, the cars is of later than 1968 vintage.  <br /> <br />Lovingly Done, Great Pictures, Good Book.	2005-09-16

Basically each page has two columns. The outside column has the text that describes what is being done on that page. The column near the gutter of the book is used for screen shots that show what the screen should look like as you do the procedure described on the outside column. This philosophy is combined with an excellent index and table of contents to enable you to quickly find what you want to do.  <br /> <br />As such, you can read the book straight through like a tutorial, or you can go directly to the part you need like a reference book. It's a book design that successfully combines the two book types.  <br /> <br />Although beginning level users can get a lot out of this book, it will be a big help if you have at least a bit of basic video editing experience. Final Cut is a professional level program. A little work with iMovie first might be a big help.	2005-09-16

Mr. Von Hoffman is a journalist who has worked for several of the countries largest newspapers and then gotten fired. He now pens columns for the New York Observer, and has written some thirteen books, several plays and more.

That's a lot of words. What it really means is that this book is aimed at the beginning to intermediate user and is intended to get him started with the 20% of the software that he will really use 80% of the time. It uses a combination of text with drawings of what the screen should look like, and even a few short QuickTime movies (on a CD-ROM that comes with the book) that show some processes that are difficult to explain with words and static pictures.  <br /> <br />The book does not require any previous experience with page layout programs. However, if you have experience with QuarkXPress or PageMaker, the first chapter talks about using your experience to give you a head start with InDesign.  <br /> <br />By chapter 2 you are looking at the pretty butterfly on the InDesign Welcome Screen and quickly moving on to the InDesign workspace. One problem beginners often have with InDesign is keeping track of all the palettes, toolboxes, and shortcuts. Chapter 2 also talks about these and helps you get the workspace set up the way it's comfortable for you.   <br /> <br />The subsequent chapters are about what you would expect, chapters on text, on bringing in graphics, on vector artwork. By the end of the book you'll know enough to use InDesign to product the documents you need.

Tourette's syndrome is a neurological disorder of the brain which causes involuntary movements and vocalizations known as tics. (For more information visit [...] an organization founded by Jim Eisenreich of the Florida Marlins.)  <br /> <br />But the story in this book is not about the disease, it's about one young man and his struggles to live a normal life while living with the syndrome. Because the tics occur in public, people with the syndrome are faced with the attitudes of other people. This might vary from ignoring the tic to thoughts in his early life that he might have been possessed by the devil. His treatment by teachers and fellow students in the public schools was as horrible as you might guess. Children can be very cruel to one another, and anyone standing out is fair game.  <br /> <br />Overcoming not the syndrome (there's no way) but the attitude of other people is the core of this story. Mr. Cohen was lucky in his finding a series of school principals, teachers, and bosses. Dating, he says, is a whole other story in itself.	2005-09-16

It includes some 1,600 granting organizations selected because libraries and information services are specifically stated as a type of organization they support, or because they have given out actual grants of $10,000 or more.  <br /> <br />The granting organizations are broken down by state, and within states by name. Information supplied about each organization includes how much money they have, how much they give out, their stated purpose, fields of interest, types of support and any limitations (some organizations limit their giving to local areas, such as Boston).  <br /> <br />There are quite a number of books written on how to apply for a grant, what should be included in your application, and so on. But after you get the application written, what do you do with it. To whom do you send it. This book is put together by The Foundation Center, a non-profit organization that was set up to assist other non-profits in their grant writing process. Their overall database includes over 78,000 grantmaking foundations.  <br /> <br />This book has only those organizations making grants to libraries and information services extracted from that database. This obviously saves your time, and of course your money. At the $125 price, smaller organizations may be unwilling or even unable to spend that much for such a book. The price however, seems fair. This book is not going to sell in the quantities you would expect of a Harry Potter novel, and The Foundation Center has to recoup their costs.  <br /> <br />What you are buying for the $125 is time (it would take you a very long time to find these organizations) and completeness (you would never find all of these organizations). The cost should be recovered in the first grant received from a source you never contacted before.  <br /> <br />This book hasinformation that you basically cannot do without if you are seeking grants.	2005-09-16

He presents some theories that the early Jewish patriarchs  and prophets (Joseph, Moses and others) were in fact Egyptian. He also presents some thinking that the Risucrucian Order began in ancient Egypt rather than being a development of much more recent time.  <br /> <br />In summary, this book presents an alternative view to the history of religion as it is commonly understood.	2005-09-16

There have always been beople who will tell you that by using their product your life would be better. And now television has come about so they can tell millions of people at once. In this case the product being sold is drugs. But what people are buying is peace of mind. It may be that that new car will help you get the girl, or maybe it's Viagra.  <br /> <br />The ones I particularly like are those commercials that can't quite describe what the illness is, but taking this drug will fix it. And I also like the bit in all of them where they have to tell about things like side effects. Strangely enough this bit seems to be spoken very fast. My favorite one here is if you get an erection that lasts more than four hours seek medical help. ==While the authors make a good case that the drug companies are treating non-existing illnesses, is it any real difference from telling us that brand name pain killers are better than those bottles labeled aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen.  <br /> <br />I think the book is quite right, the drug companies want to sell us more drugs. And they will find people willing to pay for them.

And our longevity rates are not at the top of the lists.	2005-09-16

They are the ones designing the new products, implementing the data processing systems, managing the activities of the company. These are the workers upon whom the future of the company rests. In far too many companies, the same standard rules of management are applied to these workers as to the assembly line worker.  <br /> <br />Mr. Davenport contends that knowledge workers are very different from other types of workers and need to be managed differently. In this book he reports on findings made in his study of some 100 different companies. He also reports on research conducted by other organizations. This includes such things as the working process, the development of and continuing education of knowledge workers, the physical work environment, and finally Managing Knowledge Workers.  <br /> <br />As the United States changes from a manufacturing company to a knowledge based country this becomes an even more vital concern than it was before.	2005-09-16

And most of what is written comes from the viewpoint of the American or British side. The British, for instance in their capturing and turning all of the German agents sent to England.  <br /> <br />In this book the viewpoint is of that of the head of the German Abwehr, the German Secret Service. Canaris had been a success at nearly everything he did. And the organization that he built up was quite effective.  <br /> <br />This book takes the point of view that Canaris did an awful lot to help the allied cause. Most of this took the form of putting a bias into the reports sent to Hitler. For instance the reports about what the invasion of Britain was facing showed England having more than twice as many divisions to oppose the landing as were actually present. It is difficult to say if this was deliberate or a part of British disinformation.  <br /> <br />Canaris was a member of the Hitler inner circle. This was a furiously competitive atmosphere, and in the end he lost as they fought over who would lead the falling nation.	2005-09-15

We all took the required course in Algebra. We struggled through it, we got out, and most of us never thought about the subject again.  <br /> <br />If this had been the math book we used, math might have been considered fun. It might even have taught us that we wanted to study more math. In this book the authors take some real problems, problems that might even interest one of today's teenagers and use that to discuss mathematics.  <br /> <br />Any kid would have some interest in learning about secret messages. Probably both the boys and the girls. The boys by their very nature, the girls so that the boys couldn't read their diary. Secred messages lead to cryptography and an opportunity to study prime numbers, factoring, all kinds of things.  <br /> <br />And topology, mobius strips which only have one side. You could make mobius strips in class and do some experiments that would be a lot more fun than going to the board to do long division.  <br /> <br />In part it's the subject matter that makes this book so interesting. Infinity and choas theory are just plain interesting. But it's also the writing style, for instance: 'If we were to randomly kidnap 35 people off the street, two events are remarkably likely to happen. The first is we'd probably get arrested, the second ....'  <br /> <br />Delightful book.	2005-09-15

What it's really about is teaching the IT requirements writer to communicate with the programmer folk about what he wants a business software system to do. Perhaps a title like Teaching the Business Folk How to Talk with the New Object Oriented Programmers. True, he does use UML to define the business model. But if you understood the problem you'd still not necessarily understand that UML is what you need.  <br /> <br />Object Oriented programmers talk funny, at least as far as we old fashioned procedural programmers are concerned. Mr. Podeswa uses a 'What They Say -- What They Mean' approach to help us understand the jargon of the object oriented world. Then he combines thing we can feel and touch to describe these words. For instance a specialized class like 'Samsung Camera Phone' belongs to the generalized class of 'Mobile Phone.'  <br /> <br />This is an example of the writing style where the author is leading us by the hand (with things like sample work sheets) to producing a model that the object programmers can understand. Lo and behold, it's using the UML.	2005-09-15

But like anything else in Hollywood they go through cycles. There will be a truly great, award winning, lots of money making movie; then the copycats will start making movies that are worse and worse until the idea goes around that this genre gets a bad reputation. <br /> <br />But that's a nit. Mr. Muir has done a great job talking about musicals from the 1920's to now. About a quarter of the book is a general history to get us up to through the 1980's. The remainder is broken down into decades. From the 80's and into the early 90's musicals languished. Not a solid hit among the bunch. Then came 1996. Madonna did 'Evita.' Then came 'Chicago' with a bunch of Oscars. Finally the book ends in 2004 with 'The Phantom of the Opera.'  <br /> <br />The musical has changed over time and the book talks about these changes in a literate and understanding manner. Very interesting reading from a very knowledgable author.	2005-09-15

As you can see, that's pretty basic.  <br /> <br />What makes the Maran books so good is the quality of the graphics they incorporate as part of their philosophy.

There was no underlying theory or undestanding of how changes came about. It is amazing to me that Darwin and Wallace were able to integrate their findings into a generalized theory that has stood the test of time so well.  <br /> <br />In recent years the bioinformatics people have been able to look at the basic DNA structure of species and determine changes that earlier observers just observed externally. Needless to say, this is a science that is itself rapidly evolving as more and more genomes are analyzed.  <br /> <br />This book came about as the result of a conference organized at the Institut Henri Poincare that was held in Paris in June of 2003.  Each of the major presenters were asked to write survey chapters based on the research they had presented with the aim of compiling a compact summary of the state-of-the art mathematical techniques and concepts currently used in the field of molecular phylogenetics and evolution.  <br /> <br />This approach has produced a book that is timely when compared with a single author trying to understand each of these areas of research.	2005-09-14

It is almost a coffee table picture book, filled with photographs of the earth. Yet at the same time its first edition became the text book of choice at over 300 colleges and universities around the world.  <br /> <br />This is the brand new second edition. The new edition has taken comments about the previous edition, integrated them with the results of recent discoveries and more examples, photographs, art work, and text to make the second edition even better. Each chapter of the first edition was sent to an expert reviewer (a world leader on that particular subject) for comment.  <br /> <br />The biggest change in the new edition is to stress plate tectonics earlier and stronger to provide the underlying theory that covers most of current geologic thinking.  <br /> <br />I also like his explanation of the oil situation. He looks at alternatives and points out that we may well be living in a unique time of history.	2005-09-14

They were certainly interesting times and he relates the stories very well.  <br /> <br />Second there is the story of how legislation gets passed. There are a hundred senators, all with the main focus of their lives being how to get reelected. Each has a craving to say something, anything, that will keep their face on television and the front pages of newspapers back home. All of them are independent, just like cats, and getting them moving towards the goal of passing any legislation has to be a lot like Hearding Cats.  <br /> <br />The third subject is the spectacular rise in the Republican party in recent years. When Barry Goldwater ran for president, he didn't stand a chance. I can well remember a TV comentator rhetorically asking why anyone of a minority race, anyone living in a city, any working person would vote Republican. They don't ask that question any more. The Republicans have done a supurb job of putting together a coalition that gets them into office, while the Democrats are running around in circles claiming that Bush stole the election.  <br /> <br />Regardless of your views on the Republican vs. Democrat situation, here is a story from the inside of the Senate talking about life as it really is.	2005-09-14

While the basic rules of the game haven't changed, the fact that you have to go on line, sign up, give out information such as credit card numbers make the game just a little bit different.  <br /> <br />This book is on those differences. The author talks about the various on line casinos, how to protect yourself from illegitimate operations as well as viruses, trojan horses, worms, etc. She lists about 170 casinos that she at least implies she has visited and found them to be worth recommending.  <br /> <br />It turns out that all the various casinos use software from a few software vendors. She lists these vendors and discusses some points about their software. Finally, these software packages, and consequently the casinos offer many different versions of the classical blackjack game. She goes into these differences and talks some about strategy to use with each.  <br /> <br />Note that on line casinos shuffle after each hand, so card counting won't work very well.	2005-09-14

This single match, called the 'Battle of the Sexes' was far, far more than a tennis match, and the aftereffect was far, far more than levelling the tennis game.  <br /> <br />For a tennis standpoint, before The Match womens tennis was not a serious sport. The women played, but almost by themselves. The money, the sponsors, television, the fame wasn't there. After it was all there.  <br /> <br />From a legal standpoint, The Match put power behind Title IX that required equal funding in schools for men and womens atheletic programs. From the overall women's rights viewpoint The Match was in 1973, so was Row v. Wade.  <br /> <br />Ms. Roberts is a sports columnist. This training gives her a newspaper like writing style that is very well suited to the subject she is covering here. The book reads almost like a novel, an excellent novel but also conveys the impact of The Match that changed women's sports forever.	2005-09-14

If all you want is sex for the thrill of the chase and a way to keep score, you can do it. Sure there are some mechanics to learn about how to start a conversation, how to move it along until you're in the sack. It's a numbers game. If you can coax 10% of the women you meet into bed, and if you want to bed a hundred women, then you need to contact a thousand women.<br /><br />If on the other hand, you can learn techniques that improve the percentage from 10% to 20%, then you only need to contact 500. This book is one description of a set of techniques that will help improve that percentage.<br /><br />This book is specifically aimed at men seducing women. But if you change the subject just a bit, it's like most ordinary sales manuals. Just change the subject. It's that you want to sell a hundred computers, or cars, or time shares in Iraq. It's a numbers game.<br /><br />In the sex game, it's like the author found out. Most of us seem to be programmed to want to form a couple, a permanent couple. Someone who can see your bad side and still want to put up with you down through the years.<br /><br />The book. Oh yes, the book. Funny as hell. It might even help you sell those time shares.

This book gives not only the most rounded discussion, but includes worksheets to help you define your goals and desires.  <br /> <br />There are a few specific comments worth making:  <br /> <br />Chapter 1 talks about retirement from a general sense, but the underlying tone is about the concern people have about being bored. I and the vast majority of people I know didn't have that problem at all. Instead we wonder how we ever found time to go to work. I wake up in the morning with nothing to do and by bed time it's only half done. There's the Arts Council, the community theater, church, two or three volunteer organizations, the grand kids, travel, Elderhostels and I'm outta time.  <br /> <br />The chapters on money hint at some things but I think it would be better to say simply: After the house is paid for, the vehicle is paid for, the last kid is out of college, it doesn't take all that much to live.  <br /> <br />There is one area that I wish the author would have covered. I realize that it would just be a guess, but what impact is rising oil prices going to have on retirement. Oil is now about $64 a barrel. In the future that price will double and double again. How does this impact the rest of the book? As a retired employee of an oil company I would value his guesses.	2005-09-13

They cannot be viewed as normal people. When they are female, far from beautiful, remain unmarried, somewhat sequestered, a name like Eudora, and live with their mother, the image comes unbidden of a demure Southern Lady, incapable of expressing emotion, if they have any. Eudora Welty fit this image perfectly, and because she did it is too easy to dismiss her writing as worthless.  <br /> <br />Then you look at the prizes:Pulitzer, National Book, eight (yes 8) O. Henry's, National Medal of Literature, Medal of Freedom. There had to be something more behind the image, something of life to give the understanding for such insight.  <br /> <br />Ms. Marrs biography does an excellent job of giving life to Eudora Welty. That she considered New York her alternate home. That she was for integration in a segregationist South. That the loves in her life happened to be unavailable, but that they indeed were there.  <br /> <br />Ms. Marrs book provides a view of Eudora Welty that rounds out her life in a most plesant way.	2005-09-13

It used to be that we all used view cameras. Then we put in Polariod film and shot until we got what we thought we wanted. Except that Polariod just didn't have the contrast, the lustre that real film had. Then we would switch to real film. And because we could never be sure we would shoot at the exposure we thought was right then under expose a couple, then over expose a couple in hopes of getting it right. (Anybody want to buy a view camera?)   <br /> <br />With digital, the LCD readout on the back or through the viewfinder is as perfect as it's going to get. You shoot a lot of pictures, but you vary the placement, the lights, you move things a bit. You can look for yourself or show your client the picture on a display immediately. You can save a few hundred shots on a CD-ROM and keep them forever. And the new DVD's are even better.   <br /> <br />Of course there's a chapter on selecting a camera. This book concentrates on the professional grade cameras, not the consumer point and shoot models. These SLR camers have more pixels, more features, etc. Next year the current models will all be obsolete, the features of the SLR will be down in the point and shoot and the SLR's will have even more.   <br /> <br />After these fundamental chapters, the next several chapters of the book are on shooting pictures of girls. How to select the model, how to position her, lighting, what props to use, a complete lesson on shooting for fashion.   <br /> <br />>Then it's to digital retouching to get the most out of an image. And finally some tips from a pro on how to make money in this business.   <br /> <br />Fashion photography is a nice little niche of the photographic market. There are people even in small cities making a living taking fashion pictures for advertising. Why. Look at the ads in the paper, in catalogs, on billboards.  <br /> <br />Somebody had to take those pictures.	2005-09-13

Walsingham obviously supplied Elizabeth with what she wanted. Using techniques that sound like they come from a James Bond novel, he was able to set up an intelligence network that gave the queen proof of the actions of traitors, vital information about the Spanish Armada, and more. He did this without the nicieties of Miranda warnings, or search warrents, his men opened the mail and copyed letters (especially bad for Mary Queen of Scots).  <br /> <br />Mr. Budiansky's writing style is open and easy. It reads fast, not like a history book. There are no footnotes (but there are some notes at the back of the book), there's not even an index (sorely missed if you want to look up something like where does he talk about Dudley).  <br /> <br />I'm not so sure that Walsingham's spy networks fit into today's world quite as easily as he believes. Then again during World War II with the 'Man Who Wasn't There,' and other activities, maybe it was pretty close.	2005-09-12

Easily the most famous commando type to come out of the war, this book tells the tale of just one of his exploits, the rescue of Mussolini after the Italians had arrested and imprisoned him.  <br /> <br />Hitler was furious at the Italians for treating his friend Mussolini this way. The answer was a dramatic rescue by Skorzeny. Called Operation Oak, a hand picked selection of German soldiers flew to the remote hotel where Mussolini was being held and then flew him out of Italy to Germany.  <br /> <br />This incident is possibly the best known of Skorzney's exploits. Others include the attack on the Belgian fort Eban Emael, and after the war he broke out of an American POW camp and set up the ODESSA organization to assist in the escape of former SS men to South America.	2005-09-12

I guess it must get a bit tiresome to keep going back to the same place, the same characters. So in this book Ms. Kellerman takes us back to 1920's Germany. This novel is set in Munich. Munich is known as one of the friendlier cities in Germany. Go there today and you'll visit the beer halls (well I do anyway) the quaint down town area. You'll eat some of the little finger sized sausages that are the in food there. In general you'll have a very good time.  <br /> <br />In the 1920's it must have been very different. The aftermath of World War I, the revolving door politics as Hitler was playing every point in his climb to power. The massive inflation that was to destroy the currency. And we know what's comming - World War II with its massive dying, the holocaust, the bombing. As the title says Munich was headed 'Straight Into Darkness.'  <br /> <br />Ms. Kellerman has picked her time well. This was just the start of darkness, but the clouds form a background for her novel. The novel itself is a murder mystery about a serial killer. I found myself thinking of all of these characters and the future they had before them. Does one or a few murders really matter when sixty million people are about to die. Yes, you can comprehend a few killings. And then to realize that most of these characters, young and old alike probably didn't have long to live. The young men would be in the Army. The women, the young, and the old would face the bombs.  <br /> <br />A delightful book that goes far beyond the usual mystery.	2005-09-11

Of course that's true, everyone knows that digital cameras make pictures composted of pixels but you don't quite get the importance of this until it is compared with film. It used to be that we all used view cameras. Then we put in Polariod film and shot until we got what we thought we wanted. Except that Polariod just didn't have the contrast, the lustre that real film had. Then we would switch to real film. And because we could never be sure we would shoot at the exposure we thought was right then under expose a couple, then over expose a couple in hopes of getting it right. (Anybody want to buy a view camera?)  <br /> <br />With digital, the LCD readout on the back or through the viewfinder is as perfect as it's going to get. You shoot a lot of pictures, but you vary the placement, the lights, you move things a bit. You can look for yourself or show your client the picture on a display immediately. You can save a few hundred shots on a CD-ROM and keep them forever. And the new DVD's are even better.  <br /> <br />Of course there's a chapter on selecting a camera. There are simple point and shoot cameras. Some of which are simpler than others. The top of the line have almost as much control as do the more expensive SLR cameras, including aperture, shutter speed, and the ISO setting you are using. The SLR camers have more pixels, more features, etc. Next year the current models will all be obsolete, the features of the SLR will be down in the point and shoot and the SLR's will have even more.  <br /> <br />After these fundamental chapters, the next several chapters of the book are on shooting pictures of food. How to select hte food, how to position it, light it, what props to use, a complete lesson on shooting food.  <br /> <br />Then it's to digital retouching to get the most out of an image. And finally some tips from a pro on how to make money in this business.  <br /> <br />Food photography is a nice little niche of the photographic market. There are people even in small cities making a living taking pictures of food. Why. Look at the ads in the paper, look at the photographs in some menus. Somebody had to take those pictures.	2005-09-11

Foster Collection of Marine Paintings	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Beautiful Set of Paintings, Now Broken Up	A successful stock trader, Glen S. Foster was also a champion yacht racer and for many years a major collector of maritime paintings. Most of his paintings were of yachts as opposed to military or other subjects.   <br /> <br />As might be expected the various America's Cup boats are prominent in this collection. Mr. Foster was a member of the New York Yacht Club so his interest in the America's Cup boats was not just incidental. As a yachtsman himself, he had frequented the waters where the race had been held and could recognize a true rendition of the race.   <br /> <br />This book contains 95 color plates. Each plate has a history and description written by Alan Granby. Dr. Granby is the owner of Hyland Granby Antiques which specializes in maritime antiquities and marine art. He was sponsored as a member of the New York Yacht Club by Glen Foster, and served with him on the Fine Arts Committee.   <br /> <br />The collection of paintings represented by this book was sold at auction after Mr. Foster's death so can no longer be seen as a collection anywhere but in this book.	2005-09-10

You would think that there isn't much you can do with the traditonal office space. You walk in the door, there's a desk with a receptionist or guard to sign you in, the obligatory sick looking plant or two.  <br /> <br />But in this book you can see what it is possible to do. Here some fifty of the top design firms present photographs of design projects they have completed for some of the top corporations in the country. Most of these are in the United States, ranging from New York to Los Angeles, only a few are overseas (mostly in England).  <br /> <br />Generally eash two page spread shown one project to that there are a hundred and fifty or more projects illustrated with beautiful photography.

With the advent of photography, art changed to other forms, some of which bore no recognizable appearance of anything known to anyone but the artist.  <br /> <br />With the advent of digital photography and the necessary software to manipulate images, digital artists began to move in the way of the painters. Their digital images are formed by the manipulation of multiple images, of changes that can be made down to the bit level if desired.  <br /> <br />This book explores digital art. While as of yet this is not well received by the conventional art community, it is a sign of coming times. Specifically in this book the same three specific images have been given to seventeen artists to use to illustrate what they might create. The procedures they followed to create new images coming from these three seed images are documented. The results are wildly different between the resulting pictures.  <br /> <br />This is the forefront of digital art.	2005-09-09

Terry reports that he has found his true love online, Alyssa is still looking.  <br /> <br />The web is perhaps the most significant change in communications since the invention of the printing press. And to move to match making is a logical use of these communications capability. The Internet expands your horizons beyond the local bar, or church, or any other social group that you might use to meet people.  <br /> <br />First talking about the general rules, the authors move on to the mechanics of selecting and then using these sites. Let's face it, there are some commonly understood rules about making yourself as attractive as possible over the web without telling lies. As the story goes: 'She wants Tom Cruise, but she's no Nicole Kidman.'  <br /> <br />The mechanics here include how to show yourself best in a picture, what to put in the written summary, how to phrase your first e-mail, and how to keep out of trouble -- the web is pretty wide open , how to proceed from just communicating online to gathering your heart in your throat and having that first meeting.	2005-09-09

Their son Sean would now be thirty. I find it hard to believe. I look through this book and the pictures of John Lennon and I see the life being lived to the fullest. The magic of a time long since gone. Perhaps a time of my own youth, now past.  <br /> <br />Bob Bruen was John's personal photographer for about ten years. He took thousands of photographs, and here has selected about 150 and arranged them by year. He shares them with his personal stories of being with John. Doing simple things like having dinner, or working on a concert, John being a husband and father.  <br /> <br />All I can really say is that it is a fitting tribute.	2005-09-09

This is the bible of the gun hobby. It has a series of articles that range from an analysis of the 400 Whelan, to a major article on the Bowie knife. As usual, it has a summary of what's new in handguns, rifles, shotguns and accessory items, and finally it has a complete catalog of all of the offerings of all the gun companies. I have each annual volume of Gun Digest in my library going back more than 50 years. I can't imagine doing without them.  <br /> <br />One really big change in this year's edition is that the front half of the book with the articles is printed on slick paper and in color. This really improves the appearance.  <br /> <br />As for changes in the guns themselves for this year, the big news is the sunset laws that removed the Assault Weapons Ban. This means that large (or as the Gun Digest says) full capacity magazines can now be sold again, and the evil appearing nasty looking rifles can be sold again.  <br /> <br />The one complaint that I might voice is that in the pistol section there appears to be nothing but 1911's shown. Regardless of the manufacturer, these all look the same. I'd like to see some of the more unusual guns pictures. For instance: the Olympic Arms .223 pistol, the Steyr, the Wilkinson Sherry and Linda. I guess what I'm really saying is that we need another hundred pages or so.	2005-09-09

And in the days of film cameras each new major film body would be followed in a year or two with a housing to enable its use underwater. In those days camera bodies stayed in production for a long time.  <br /> <br />With digital cameras, the industry is still in a period of fast change. The camera you buy today will probably be replaced in a year or two. The underwater housing people have come up with housing just about as fast as the cameras come out. Sometimes it seems even before the cameras are shipped.  <br /> <br />Jack and Sue Drafahl have been underwater photographers for 35 years. They have made the change to digital and in this book describe the advantages and differences of using digital equipment underwater.  <br /> <br />The book is a general introduction to underwater photography as well as covering the specialized parts of digital photography. Well worth reading before your trip to the islands.	2005-09-09

Of these sports, in the form of special olympics has probably generated the most attention. But plays have been written that feature disabled people.  <br /> <br />The late Christopher Reeve raised the bar, so to speak, with his public appearances where his speech was delivered with the help of artificial breathing apparatus.  <br /> <br />The book is a serie of articles written by, I guess you would call them experimenters, working in these fields. Most of the writers are connected with universities but vary widely in their areas of study including: theater, sociology, women's studies, social anthropology, medicine, communications, English, and dance. Other writers are practicing musicians, playwrights, or poets.  <br /> <br />This is a book that is breaking new ground in the area of disability studies.	2005-09-09

It is the story of learning from failures. In the history of the space programs there have been some 2,500 failures of one kind or another.  <br /> <br />I can well remember the first American attempt to launch a satellite using the Vanguard rocket. It was a beautiful rocket. It fired up, rose a few feet, then still perfectly balanced came back down and blew up spectacularly. Then there was the European Mars lander, Beagle 2, the problems with the Hubble Space Telescope, and of course Challenger.  <br /> <br />Broken into two main parts, the first half of the book is on failures in the Launch Vehicles. The second half goes into the failures in the satellites and space probes. The surprising thing about all these failures is the ability of the engineers to often work around the failures and still get some value out of the mission.  <br /> <br />It seems the Murphy really rules space activities. Everything has happened from dropping satellites on the floor, to soaking them in water through a hole in the roof, pieces left out, screws tightened to tightly, or not tight enough, hundreds of things.  <br /> <br />The rockets are designed at the limit of everything to reduce weight, increase performance. The spacecraft have to operate in environments impossible to test on earth. Adding redundancy to a space craft reduces the weight/space available for mission payload.  <br /> <br />Fascinating book	2005-09-09

But the vast majority of the book is on electrical equipment. After all, most of the things on the boat sooner or later wind up being part of the electrical system.  <br /> <br />Many boats have two electrical systems in parallel. There's the basic DC system, usually 12 volt, sometimes 24. Then there's an entirely separate circuit for 115 volt AC power used when the boat is docked at appropriate places. This book covers it all. The first chapters are on the battery itself and the circuitry around the boat. Then it gets into battery chargers, inverters, wind and water generators, solar cells, everything you ever wanted to know. There are chapters on corrosion, lightning protection, radios and antennas and on and on. About half the book is on purely electrical devices.  <br /> <br />The remaining half has chapters on engines, toilets, air conditioning and so on, but this also includes a lot of electrical devices such as autopilots, bow thrusters, and so on that may require electrical power.  <br /> <br />Basically this is the bible on how to fix things on the boat.

Mr. Gibson takes some offense at this as there were others before him. In fact you might consider Frankenstein as the start, although to be sure 'cyber' hadn't been invented then. Numerous other science fiction novels have something with computer enhancement to a human, even if it is only with 'smart' prostheses replacing a lost arm.  <br /> <br />This book traces the transformation of cyberpunk from a literary movement into a multimedia cultural phenomenon. He traces the development of cyberpunk into comic books (Deathlok), film (Robocop - but how could he have missed Darth Vader?), and into other areas.	2005-09-08

Some schools use it heavily, some treat it more as a formality. At any case, if you are planning on grad school, it's probably something you have to do. The testing will take three hours.  <br /> <br />This book, just out with a 2006 edition is based on many years of monitoring the test. While the actual questions are copyrighted and not released, questions that are very similar to the actual tests can be made up and used for practice. In addition, comments on strategy and test taking techniques can be of great help.  <br /> <br />There are three parts to the test, Math (Quantitative Ability), Verbal Ability and Analytical Writing. This book has five major parts, one each for of the three test parts. Each of these parts of the book has a description of the test, some hints and tips that have been frequently helpful in the actual testing, some study guide information, some sample questions to illustrate what they are talking about. Two other parts are an introduction/description of the test, and a part containing five sample tests. Finally there's a CD-ROM included with the book. This has a practice test designed to be as much like a real GRE as possible.  <br /> <br />It is often said that you can't practice for the GRE, that you should just go into it and do your best. This would be true if this were an intelligence test, but it isn't. It's just another standardized test. And you can certainly learn more about how to take a standardized test.	2005-09-08

There's a crime (a missing beautiful teenage girl -- do ordinary looking teenage girls ever go missing?), it brings a sense of deja vu to the investigating officer Lieutenant Jonathan Stride because of its simularity to a previous case.  <br /> <br />The investigation proceeds, the case goes to court, then -- well then all kinds of things start to happen.

That way you get the low down on things like the quality of life, cafeteria food, social life, political leaning, all in all some 60 categories. That's in addition, of course to the standard information that you'd get from the school itself like admissions criteria, deadlines, phone numbers etc.  <br /> <br />You've got to enjoy some of the categories in which colleges are ranked: Under Politics:  <br />    Students Most Nostalgic for Ronald Reagan  <br />    Students Most Nostalgic for Bill Clinton  <br />    Students Most Politically Active  <br />    Election? What Election?  <br /> <br />Under Food:  <br />    Best Campus Food  <br />    Is It Food?  <br /> <br />There are about 3,500 colleges and universities in the United States. Selecting the 361 to feature here is a combination of science and art. At the top is certainly a set of schools like Harvard or Stanford that will be on any list. As you get down into the hundreds there is more choice. After a while geographic diversity, rounding out the variety eventually has to get down to a feeling that we want this one more than that one. You may disagree, but this is the editors choice of the top 10% of the schools in America.  <br /> <br />Easily one of the best college reference books.	2005-09-08

His scope is vast, this book is on music but there are other books on theater and film. His insight into music comes not from his performing ability (he doesn't) but from his love. His comments display his wide knowledge of not only music but the entire range of the performing arts.  <br /> <br />The book contains four big sections on Criticism from the 1970s, 80s, 90s and the 2,000s. Within each section there are reviews and essays that are arranged chronologically according to the dates they were originally published in the various magazines or newspapers for which Mr. Simon writes.  <br /> <br />You will find Mr. Simon's writing to be erudite and a pleasure to read. His topics are far ranging, and he is able to see connections between his current subject and a wide range of past events.  <br /> <br />Very enjoyable reading.	2005-09-07

Become computer literate at a level where you can swap out a failed hard disk or powersupply or upgrade your memory. Your local community college probably has courses on doing this if you need help. Then keep spares of parts that are likely to fail around: power supply, hard drive, monitor, motherboard, CPU, etc. I usually buy these things on eBay before I need them - I just ordered a motherboard for $20 and an 866 MHz Pentium III for $9.  <br /> <br />2. Research your business carefully. Some of the ideas in this book aren't very applicable. For instance #46 Internet Service Provider has been pretty well taken over by the big guys and you probably can't compete. And a lot of the things like medical transcription has been taken over by companies in India.  <br /> <br />They comment that you should buy the fastest computer you can afford. Unless you really need the power, to do something like high end graphics or computer aided design, you don't need that much power. My fastest machine is a 1 GHz AMD Athlon that I bought with a 17\\" monitor at a thrift store for $75. I did upgrade the memory.  <br /> <br />Further, you need more than one machine. I use four networked together: web server, database & mail server (the Athlon), and two slower machines for serfing the web, word processing, etc. Why two machines, often one gets busy for a minute or two (downloading something for instance) and then I can work using the other one. I also have a spare machine sitting on the floor if one of these should fail. Computers do fail, and Murphy says that will happen at the worst possible time, i.e. Sunday afternoon when you need to deliver your work on Monday morning.	2005-09-07

Then when you take two things that taste as good as coconuts and pecans and mix them together how can it not be wonderful. Oh well, that'd dinner for tonight.  <br /> <br />Being a southerner, I then had to go look and see what they had for recipies using grits. They have a garlic-cheese recipie that looks pretty good. My only complaint is that they specify quick-cooking grits. Not good, I'll use high quality stone ground yellow grits from some place like the Old Mill at Guilford (NC) or Bob's Red Mill (Portland, OR).  <br /> <br />Officially designated at the Christmas cookbook, there are lots of deserts. That's OK, because my circle of friends tends to have lots of pot-lucks, and deserts are definitely in order. Besides the normal cakes and pies, here are some wonderful sounding candies: chocolate-Praline Truffles, Roasted Nut Clusters, Millionaires (sometimes called Turtles), and of course fudge (can it be Christmas without fudge) and Mississippi Mud Brownies. <br /> <br />This is a Sunset book, you know what to expect, and you won't be disappointed.	2005-09-07

This is not exactly a new concept as the cyclical nature of markets has been a major point of study in the price of stocks, bonds, interest rates, and just about everything else.  <br /> <br />Note though that the cycles are not quite as even and regular as his diagrams show. You have to make decisions yourself using not only the techniques he describes, but factors that may be unique to your own location.  <br /> <br />For instance:  <br /> <br />I live in an area where gold mining is the largest industry. When the price of gold starts up, the mines start hiring more people and the availability of houses goes down and prices sky rocket. When the price of gold falls, well would you like a house where the previous owner dropped the keys off at the bank on his way out of town?  <br /> <br />Housing is also a factor of other things. What will happen to the value of houses in the new sub-divisions that are 50 miles from down town? What was resonable last year may be quite different with gasoline over $3. Suppose gas goes to $10.  <br /> <br />Read what Mr. Trass has to say, he has some very good points and expresses them well, but then modify it to suit your own ideas.	2005-09-07

To Terence Kirk, it is more memorable as the day that he (and 202 other China Marines) were captured by the Japanese. They were to remain prisoners for 1,355 days, the entire length of time the U.S. was at war with Japan.  <br /> <br />American Marines in Japanese prisoner of war camps were 17.5 times more likely to die from the treatment in those camps than they were to die in combat. Mr. Kirk survived. and as of the time of writing this book there were 31 survivors of the 202 China Marines.  <br /> <br />Unique to Mr. Kirk, so far as is known he was the only one to have built a camera while in the POW camp and taken pictures. This is his story and some of the pictures.  <br /> <br />Mr. Kirk ends this book: 'If not for the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , we would have met certain death.' I think he's right.	2005-09-07

They distill what you really need to know from all the techno jargon. This gives you a book that will help you get the job done without being so heavy that you can hardly carry it.  <br /> <br />This is a book on setting up a small office or home office (SOHO) network. It starts with the basic question of why do you want a network, and some comments on what a SOHO network will do for you. The second chapter goes into what hardware you'll need, i.e. cabling, hubs and switches. Chapters three through five go into choosing the specific hardware you'll need, setting it up and configuring it the way you need.  <br /> <br />Chapter six is on firewalls. Most of the chapter is on using the firewall that comes with Windows XP. This is fair, because this firewall is basically free. But this firewall only protects the system it's running on. That means that you have to set up the firewall on each machine and keep it up to date. My own suggestion here is don't use the Windows firewall, instead go buy one of the commercial hardware units - I've used D-Link DI-604's (They're only about $50) for years and never had any trouble. Other brands are probably OK as well, I've just not used them myself. <br /> <br />The last chapter is on Voice Over Internet Protocol or VOIP. Regular telephone long distance has gotton so cheap that I don't use it. But if you talk overseas a lot it would save a bunch of money.  <br /> <br />Good book to get you started.	2005-09-07

Mr. Read seems to give Hitler the same kind of reverence that religious leaders have had. The actions and loyalty of his closest allies is difficult to explain in any other way.<br /><br />The book is arranged chronographically. At different stages Hitler needed different kinds of support, and he was able to get it from a variety of people that you wouldn't expect would have been so filled with puppy like devotion. At the same time these 'disciples' were fighting each other like children seeking the teachers attention in elementary school.<br /><br />About two thirds of the book takes place before the Polish invasion of 1939. This was the critical time when Hitler was rising to power, selecting his closest associates and formulating the plans he had for Germany.<br /><br />The book ends with the execution of the Germans as a result of the Nurnberg trials. Their struggles for power and recognition were over.	2005-09-07

But I'm certainly glad to have an opportunity to read about her experiences. Aside from the sexual aspects, her Army experience was much like mine, basically like being in the Boy Scouts but with no adult leaders. But then, if this were the story of just another GI, it wouldn't be half as interesting.  <br /> <br />Her stories of what it is like to be bright, pretty and female in an ocean of men. As with any GI, she treats the problem with a mixture of understanding and profanity. She doesn't explicitly state it, but she also learned an awful lot about men while in Iraq. At one location she was one of four women along with 500 men. As soon as you walk down the chow line, everyone is staring at you, at every part of you, with looks that clearly show what they are thinking.  <br /> <br />All in all, a great description of the life of a female in the Army. She has a great insight and can clearly express her thoughts and feelings.	2005-09-07

This book is on building in a way that provides everything you need in a house, but doing so with a minimal impact on the earth.  <br /> <br />The first step is building a house that is satisfactory but not so big as has become normal in the US, and designing it for energy efficiency. Well insulated houses are easier to keep warm in the winter, cool in the summer.  <br /> <br />After the design is completed, then comes the selection of components and materials to be used in the construction of the house. That's where this book comes in. In going through the book you can find ideas that will help you in the design, but more importantly, you will find components that fall into the general rules of 'reuse/recycle.' Here is lumber recovered from older buildings, lumber made from plastic that from recycled packaging. Here are high performance appliances, insulation made from recycled components. <br /> <br />This book takes the form of a listing of suppliers, broken down by category. I find that by looking at these procucts, many of which I didn't even know existed, the design of the house is changed to fit.  <br /> <br />These people have done an excellent job of research as to what's avaialble.	2005-09-07

As such what could be a clear presentation of an interesting possibility comes across as just more Bush hatred.  <br /> <br />Judging from the title of the book, Mr. Clark's main emphasis is that continuing to have oil priced in dollars rather than spreading the standard pricing out to other currencies such as Euro's was a major cause of the decision to invade Iraq. This is a very interesting point and should receive greater emphasis.  <br /> <br />In chapter 2, US Geostategy and the Persian Gulf, he talks about the history of the US relations with that region. I don't find much about dollar vs. Euro in this chapter.  <br /> <br />Chapter 3 is an excellent introduction to the peak in global oil production which is as he says is the Millennium's Greatest Challenge. He's clearly right there, but this goes far beyond dollar vs. Euro. It has the potential for massive starvation, end of private automobiles, all kinds of things.  <br /> <br />Chapter 4 is called Manifest Subterfuge. Here he is almost ranting and raving that the Bush administration deliberately lied in his reasons for going to war in Iraq. He has a chart for instance of part of the organization chart of the government that he calls the 'Lie Factory.' There's no possibility in Mr. Clark's mind that the case for weapons of mass destruction was simply a mistake. For another view you might want to read the article in the Atlantic Monthly, January/February 2004 issue. In this article entitled 'Spies, Lies, and Weapons: What Went Wrong' by Kennety Pollack, a leading Iraq expert from the Clinton administration gives another account of how we erred. He says that every intelligence agency in the world was convinced that Iraq had WMD's. Note that this was from the Clinton administration, and he says that they considered invading Iraq as well. I wonder if in Mr. Clark's view, a liberal like Clinton would be better than Bush doing the same thing.  <br /> <br />I do recommend this book, I just wish it were not quite so strident. We need to have all points of view brought out as we enter a troubled future.	2005-09-06

It has been found useful in enabling the Java programmer to get the most out of the basically procedural oriented SQL.  <br /> <br />This particular book has a good title that comes from the fact that this book is intended to get the reader up and using Hibernate quickly. It could also be called Hibernate 20%. Like with most languages, about 20% of what Hibernate can do is really used in about 80% of the cases.  <br /> <br />Hibernate Quickly is basically a tutorial oriented book that starts with the installation of Hibernate and leads you through a series of uses of the software. It begins quite simply to illustrate what the software can do, then incrementally increases the tasks until the 20% level is reached.  <br /> <br />For more information about Hibernate, i.e. a reference book that covers everything it can do, Hibernate in Action was written by the developers and is excellent. It's not as user friendly in getting started as this one, so both books are recommended.	2005-09-06

Here they've given this treatment to the home of American submarines, the base at New London, CT. As is usual in these books, they start with the first pictures available (which probably came from before it was a base at all), through the initial uses of the base, i.e. a coaling station for the Navy, and the first submarines.  <br /> <br />The first was the USS Moccasin (SS-5), built in 1903 and in New London shortly after that. In 1916 it became the Submarine Base, it had a flotilla of subs being used in World War I. Gradually it grew to include the school that by World War II was producing the crews to take the war to the Japanese.  <br /> <br />As usual, I find it difficult to see where they could have found all the photographs reproduced in this book. The normal layout is two pictures per page, so there are probably a couple of hundred pictures in this little book. It's a fascinating book.	2005-09-06

On 18 July in 2004 he was sent to Iraq. And on that date he began keeping a diary of his thoughts and actions.  <br /> <br />All in all, it doesn't seem like the Army has changed much since I was in. There is work to do, but it isn't very taxing (I was not getting shot at), and it doesn't take very long. Then there's the pool and the beer hall, endless hours at the pool and the beer hall.  <br /> <br />This is an interesting book because it is about the day to day life of a low level soldier in Iraq. In general he is upbeat about the American actions in nation building over there.  <br /> <br />I find myself wondering at the end of the book about Mr. Kiver's future. In a quick scan on the internet it said that after six years in the Army he was still a PFC. That's a pretty low rank for someone of that much time. And the book says he has a masters degree in the History of the American Civil War. If he stays in the Army or not, I hope this is not the last we hear of Mr. Kiver.	2005-09-06

Back in 1970 the book The Limits to Growth told us that we were going to run out of oil and that there would be a collapse of the kind of society that we've come to know (and love or hate) by around 2050. The first half of this book updates what was said back then. And the news isn't good. If anything the basic findings from 1970 are confirmed. This analysis takes about half the book. We will not have the free wheeling oil based economy that we have now. <br /> <br />The part that was missing from The Limits to Growth was the social aspects. Mr. Heinberg has at least made an attempt to forecast what these will be. There's an old saying that predicting the future is easy, it's being right that's hard. Mr. Heinberg's future certainly seems to be based on facts reasonably extrapolated into the future. Will he be completely right, of course not. Is his thinking a good start, absolutely.  <br /> <br />The point that I think I found most fascinating is his description of four sets of voices talking about the oil situation:  <br /> <br />Conventional free market economists -- No problem, higher prices will make us find more and develop substitutes.  <br /> <br />Environmental Activists -- Conserve because of greenhouse gasses and polution for our children's sake.  <br /> <br />Petroleum Geologists -- We are about at the peak of production and it will decline from here on.  <br /> <br />Politicians -- Generally support the economists, they don't want to go to the voters and say anything bad. Leftists think price caps and subsidies to low-income people and blame the oil companies. Rightists think eliminating environmental regulations will open vast new fields. Sounds just like our last presidential election.  <br /> <br />Mr. Heinberg is down on nuclear power because of the environmental concerns. Since the book was published the impact of the Kyoto Accords has made the elimination of greenhouse gases a requirement in manycountries. In the past year the price of uranium has gone up 500%. Nuclear is just about the only practical alternative available today. While the environmentalists are concerned, the great unwashed wants power and the politicians don't want them upset.	2005-09-06

Experience has taught me several things.  And I'm going to use that experience to comment on some of her 101 tips.  <br /> <br />Tip #1 - Do a business plan. There are several software programs that are almost fill in the blank. Get one and fill in the blanks. Even if you never show this plan to anyone else, it will force you to think through your whole business.  <br /> <br />Tip #7 - Start on a Shoestring. It is much easier to get money to expand a business than it is to get money to start from scratch.  <br /> <br />Re a bunch of Tips on borrowing money - Don't. It has to be paid back. Unless you are very, very certain that you can pay it back in a very short time - DON'T!  <br /> <br />Tip 46-48 - Yes, yes, a hundred times YES!. Live cheaply. Don't buy the big car, big house, whatever.  <br /> <br />Tips 77-80 - Government Programs. Forget them, they aren't worth the time they take.  <br /> <br />Tips on venture capital and going public. This is a basic business decision. Do you want to run a small business or create a public company that you can get out of?  <br /> <br />This lady understands what she is writing about.

It has taken some time for Vietnamese foods to have become established as one of the authentic ethnic foods available over most of the country.  <br /> <br />In part this time delay was caused by the availability of authentic spices.

But it's more than that. Telescopes have been the ultimate interaction between hard core science (Newton's development of the theory of gravity for instance) and the state of the art in quite a number of technologies.  <br /> <br />For instance lens making was in the early days an offshoot of manufacturing eye glasses. One of the first things to be actually manufactured that could be called high tech. Today the mirrors of large telescopes are made by putting molten glass in a bowl (if you will) that can be spun around a vertical axis so that the centrifugal force causes the glass to flow outwards to rise along the edges of the bowl and form the curve wanted.  <br /> <br />The glass used in these large lenses is not old reclaimed Coke bottles. It is precisely defined and manufactured by only three or four companies in the world. It is also not cheap.  <br /> <br />Any imperfections in the rotation of the 'bowl' will cause ripples in the surface so the bearings are as perfect as it is possible to make them and the drive motors designed for absolutely perfect speeds.  <br /> <br />All of these technologies must come together to make a modern instrument. Like it has for four centuries, these technologies have driven the state of the art every higher, and there is no end in sight.  <br /> <br />This book details the history of the telescope, and in doing so, describes the state of the art in a lot of manufacturing fields. Highly recommended.	2005-09-03

And as the author says, 'it was fun to visit with Leonardo while I was writing this.'	2005-09-03

With one and a half million Robosapiens sold in the Christmas season last year, this is the largest selling robot of all time. 99% of them will be played with a little, the novelty will wear off, they'll go in the closet with the rest of the old toys. But that other 1%, maybe that many, will be used as the basis for any of a number of other projects. This book shows how to take the basic Robosapien and convert, modify, add a number of alternative features and capabilities to it.  <br /> <br />Some of these 'hacks' include, controlling Robosapien from a home computer, adding any or all of several electronic features to Robosapien, adding a different processor to Robosapien. Several of these hacks would make a very good science project for a high schooler, and would even be a pretty good introduction to abeginning class in electronics.	2005-09-03

About twenty years ago the advent of big/fast computers (by the standards of those days) began to allow the ready solution of these problems without requiring large numbers of people doing the computing.  <br /> <br />Borwein and Bailey have been pioneers in the exploration of the types of mathematical problems that would lend themselves to solution using digital computational means. This book describes this new approach to mathematics, commonly called 'experimental mathematics.'  <br /> <br />Obviously in computer related mathematics it began with a lot of emphasis on prime numbers, on calculating the value of Pi to ever greater precision. It has since moved on to many other classes of problems, and the work of the principle researchers in the field is summarized here.	2005-09-02

Straight was hansome, rich, and moved in the power circles in America. He visited Roosevelt and offered to become his personal secretary (what a job for a communist agent), but was turned down. Roosevelt instead got him a job in the State Department.  <br /> <br />Straight entered the Army during World War II and in his 'confession' in 1963 he said that he had stopped working for the Soviets when he joined the Army. In this book Mr. Perry presents pretty good evidence that this was not true and that Straight continued to work for the KGB until at least the late 1960's, and possibly until is death in 2004.  <br /> <br />This is a new book, exhaustively researched and contradicts Straight's own book 'After Long Silence,' especially on activities since World War II. The interested reader should read both books. Mr. Perry further speculates from time to time on activities of which there are no records. These are, however, clearly marked as speculation.	2005-09-02

Why would you want to buy a book on the movie?  <br /> <br />Well, maybe because you want to see how they did some things. Maybe because the still shots in the movie give you time to look at what you are seeing for a while instead of being forced to go on to something else.  <br /> <br />The making of a major motion picture like this is a big effort combining the talents of a lot of highly skilled folk. If you're into movies, knowing how they had to import material for Arthur Dent's pajamas from Turkey makes a very good trivia point to have at your fingertips.  <br /> <br />I guess there's really no good good, solid, sound reason to buy this book. Except I like it, I found the pictures and writing to be fun to read. I've loaned it out to a few other fans. Good reason or not, I think you should go out and buy it.	2005-09-02

It isn't, it's a microcosm of what the United States SHOULD BE.  <br /> <br />Vernon Jordan, is quoted as saying, 'there was a time when the Vineyard was the only spot for successful black people, and in many ways it still is.' And that's good. There should be places where the stresses of our daily lives are relaxed regardless of the color barrier.  <br /> <br />Perhaps it's the isolation, perhaps the income level, but I read this book while 26,000 National Guard troops are being sent to New Orleans. There the mostly black, unbelievably poor are reportedly shooting at the helicopters bringing releif supplies into the city. This is not going to contribute to the long term state of race relations.  <br /> <br />This book is good to read just to show what a delightful place the world could be.	2005-09-02

Back when I was studying physics in college we studied the theory of gravity. It, like evolution, is only a theory. But in all of recorded history there has never been an observed violation.  <br /> <br />Yes, evolution is only a theory. But it's the best theory we have as a result of lots of very bright people working over a very long time as to how the world came about.  <br /> <br />In this book Ms. Scott presents a very balanced view of saying this is how the scientific mind works. Developing a theory, testing that theory against experimental and observed evidence, evolving the theory to meet the data. She also presents a pretty good view of creationism or its newly evolved name 'intelligent design.' She is hampered here because the authors of the main books in this area have refused to allow her to quote from their publications. Oh yes, openness is another characteristic of the scientific principles.  <br /> <br />There is a feeling, a belief amongst the creationists that their views have been subject to peer review, just like any scientific paper. Yes, they've been subjected to peer review. It's just that the peers have rejected them, but that doesn't get mentioned.  <br /> <br />Ms. Scott has presented a reasonable, well balanced argument. I wish I had a feeling that anyone would change their opinions after reading it.  <br /> <br />It seems strange to me that here in the US we have this kind of debate going on with the fundamentalist folk, just like we have with another set of fundamentalists who tellt heir followers to go blow up the World Trade Center.	2005-09-02

But not this one. Here are the random thoughts, the sketches from life on the recesses of their minds of a bunch of people who keep diaries or journals. These are kept for various reasons, but for private reasons (except for scientists documenting their research) just to enable them to record what impacts their day.  <br /> <br />Jennifer New managed to get a bunch of people to share their journals with her, and now with us. The format she has followed is to give a page or so of writing about each person and then a few pages from their journal. These are the private thoughts of these people that are now being shared. Some of the thoughts, the pictures, the words are profound. Some are fairly mundane, such as the chart of a month's temperature. Some reflect theoretical mathematical thought, an insight into a scientists mind.  <br /> <br />It's an amazing collection of random art. Very enjoyable to look at, and that's what art is all about.	2005-09-02

This is a light and amusing little book on the serious subject of crossword puzzles. I say serious, because anything done on a regular basis by 64 million people in the United States alone has to be considered pretty serious. And you'd better read it with a dictionary close by. Crossword people know lots of words, some of them pretty strange, and when they write their own book, they get to use them. While most of us have a hard time putting words like adit (an almost horizontal entrance to a mine), oryx (African antelope genus), ani (members of an American bird genus), esne (my dictionary didn't even have this one) into our working vocabulary.  <br /> <br />And of course these people at this level only have one crossword in mind, the one in the New York Times (four to ten minutes to finish, 16 on Sunday). I liked the story where someone asked him if he could have his paper when he was through with it. 'Yes,' he replied, 'but the puzzle is already done.'

It was the regiment that had Private then Corporal Hitler in its ranks.  <br /> <br />It was in the regiment that Hitler claimed he changed from a self-confessed 'weak-kneed cosmopolitan' into an anti-Semite and ardent pan-German nationalist. It was here that he decided he must place his dreams of architectural or artistic glory on hold and instead devote his immediate post-war future to politics. As Hitler claimed, the List Regiment provided him with his University of Life.  <br /> <br />It was also here that he developed his understanding of military affairs. In the greatest successes of the regiment, in defensive actions on the Aubers Ridge, Hitler developed that the belief well-entrenched and well-supplied German soldier, suitably motivated and ideologically reinforced was invincible.  <br /> <br />It was this kind of belief that led Hitler to many of the decisions he made during the entirely different situations in World War II. But after all, this was his university.  <br /> <br />This is a splendid book on describing the war on the Western Front, and how being there influenced Hitler. Highly recommended.	2005-09-02

I've seen it from several angles, including overhead from a plane on an absolutely gorgeous day. I've never really had the urge to go walking up that vertical face. In fact I've often wondered just what it was that drove climbers to challenge the rock, to challenge themselves.  <br /> <br />Mr. Madgic calls the two principal climbers reckless. But he also explains that this was a typical decision that they would make as a way to conquer their own fears.  <br /> <br />I was left with several feelings. One is that their actions really caused a great deal of risk and effort on the part of the rescue people. Their own foolishness is one thing, but to cause others to be at risk is quite another. Two, any remote desire that I might have had to climb half dome is totally erased. I'll just look at it from a distance.  <br /> <br />As for the book itself. It is well written, it reads almost like a mystery novel. You are wondering just what's going to happen to these people. If it is evening while you're up to the lightening strike, put the book down right then. Otherwise you'll be up later than you planned.	2005-09-01

It was armored (sort of, about 1/3 of an inch), and because of the tracks had very good cross country mobility. It was reasonably reliable (in later versions) and cheap. It was made in several factories in the UK as well as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA.  <br /> <br />This book is another of Osprey's specialist books describing a single line of vehicles in great detail from its history to cut away drawings, dozens of variations, a magnificant set of photographs. It is probably the last word on Bren Gun Carriers (a name by which they are universally known, that was totally incorrect).	2005-09-01

The book starts with some background information about transport aircraft in general with some photographs of the Douglas C-124 Globemaster flying in formation with a C-141. From here it goes through the procurement process to the construction of the first aircraft. Then towards the end of the book there is a photograph of a C-141 having been chopped into several parts at the Aircraft Maintenance and Regeration center (AMARC) in Tucson, Arizona.   <br /> <br />In between is the story of the C-141 itself. The story includes all versions of the C-141, including the single commercial aircraft constructed and variations that were proposed by Lockeed to the Air Force. The implication in the book is that the C-141 was itself successful. One question I would like to ask is: 'why were the commercial aircraft and the optional tanker, etc. aircraft types not successful.' What was better about the DC-10 to make it a better tanker than a modified C-141?   <br /> <br />In 1994 the Air Force determined that flying C-141's bast the equivalent of 45,000 hours could jeoparize the design's inherent fail-safe features because of the onset of widespread fatigue. At that time, the C-141's began to be rapidly replaced by the C-17. As of June 1944 63 C-141's remain, 24 of which are in active use.   <br /> <br />Finally at the end of the book is a list of the 19 aircraft that were lost to accidents and crashes, and a list of the places where preserved aircraft can be seen.	2005-09-01

There is just enough writing to explain what the photographs show. Combined they make a pretty good history of the United States involvement in World War I.  <br /> <br />While the American involvement in that was was much later and much smaller than that of their allies, they came at a critical time. The British, French and German armies had bled each other nearly to death. All of a sudden the arrival of a million Americans with more on the way tipped the balance.  <br /> <br />There is also a suggestion that the tactics used by the Americans had been upgraded from the march in formation tactics used in the early days to more of a 'fire and maneuver' tactic that is much more suited to attacks in the days of machine guns. I do not know if this was an American invention, or if the other allied armies had learned this as well by this time in the war.  <br /> <br />The key though to this book is the pictures. I can remember trying to find pictures of World War I some years back and had great difficulty. Here all of a sudden here they are.	2005-09-01

In the American Southwest that means Adobe and rock. Adobe is, of course, a sun baked mud that has been reinforced through the addition of straw, small sticks, and originally manure. This lead to a style of house with vertical thick walls, flat roofs that minimized the amount of wood needed and little decoration. Just exactly the type of house memorialized in one western movie after another.   <br /> <br />Of course in today's world the one or two room shack just won't do. But the style serves as a basis for some of the west's finest architects and designers. Today's Southwestern home can come complete with heavy duty stainless steel appliances nestled in around the rock face. The bath may have a rustic look, but it's with a designer sink. The strong room, where you originally hid from the indians or tornados may today hold a wine cellar.  <br /> <br />Arizona native Martinson has carefully selected a series of houses to show in this beautifully illustrated volume that shows just what Southwestern style can do under good hands.	2005-09-01

This was Kasserine Pass. This was the first time that American forces came into contact with the Germans in World War II, and a lot of the American ideas were found wanting.  <br /> <br />The battle itself was really quite simple. The Germans under Rommel were retreating from the British. The Americans intended to cross through Kasserine and block his retreat. Rommel decided to teach the upstart Americans a lesson and sent a force to attack the advancing Americans. This is sometimes called Rommel's last victory. The Americans were hurt badly, but because of Arnim's refusal to help and the advancing British, Rommel's forces could not exploit his victory.  <br /> <br />The critical points about Kasserine were in the aftermath of the battle.  <br /> <br />General Fredendall, the commander of the American II Corp had established an excellent reputation in training his men. Taking them into combat proved to be a different proposition. He was releived and replaced by Patton.  <br /> <br />The British generals, especially Montgomery looked at the American defeat and developed the opinion that the American army was not good. At that time they were not as good as his 8th Army. But he forgot that his own introduction to combat had been at a place called Dunkirk. British General Anderson's performance was also found wanting and he was sidelined for the rest of the war.  <br /> <br />Some American equipment, the 37 mm anti tank gun and the M3 medium tank were definitely found to be obsolete. The M4 Sherman tank was found to be the equal to what the Germans were using and the decision was made to put it into high volume production. The Army was very slow about improving the Sherman, the Germans went on to the Panther and Tiger.  <br /> <br />A lot of the American armies organization, training and doctrine was found to be wanting and was changed. The American army in Normandy in 1944 was not the same as the one at Kasserine.  <br /> <br />This small book is an excellent description of the battle. It's maps and drawings clearly illustrate what happened. Mr. Zaloga concludes that this was, in the end, not a defeat for the Americans. It's true that the Americans eventually stopped the Germans, but I think he is a British writer being gracious to the Americans. How about we conclude that this was an American defeat but not a disaster?	2005-09-01

He has spent his life sturying counter-terrorism. This book is based on his doctoral discertation 'Israel's Counter-Terrorism Strategy.' It has been expanded to cover the world rather than just Israel.  <br /> <br />Most of the book is presented in the form of dilemmas. For instance, is terrorism a crime such as murder where the individual who did it should be hunted down, tried, imprisoned, etc.? Or is it a form of warfare where the individual perpetrator is less important than the organization be it govermental or otherwise behind him? The answer to this question determines what investigative techniques can be used, what incarceration rules should be followed, how extradition agreements are applied (murderers can be extradited, political activists are not ).  <br /> <br />All of these examples are just in the first chapter. There are ten chapters, each of which cover one area of dilemmas. Chapter 8, for instance covers the media. The terrorists understand and play for media attention. On the other (and darker) side, coverage of terrorists increases viewership or numbers of newspapers sold.  <br /> <br />This book is the most complete, most thought-out comprehensive discussion on counter-terrorism that I have seen. Note my emphasis on counter-terrorism. This is a book on how to fight terrorism, it is not a book on terrorism per se.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended. I hope our leaders read this.	2005-09-01

The subject, Godel, is one of the pre-eminent mathematicians of the twentieth century. This biography, written by a mathematician spends a good bit of time on the math that Godel was doing as well as the story of his life.  <br /> <br />Chapter III, for instance is a capsule history of the development of logic to 1928. This is to give background to the mathematical world as it existed when Godel was starting his work. In particular it discusses the open problems in mathematics that David Hilbert proposed in 1900.  Godel resolved the second of these problems.  <br /> <br />Coupled with his genius in mathematics, Godel also had serious psychological problems. He eventually died of starvation because he was convinced that the food he was getting had been poisoned and refused to eat. Dr. Dawson has written a compasionate and understanding biography, even if the mathematics gets just a bit deep once in a while.	2005-09-01

The taxes in England at the time were something like 90%. Hey, it made good sense.  <br /> <br />As I grew older I learned more about taxes, usually by having to pay them. But I also learned that there are limits to taxes at which it is more beneficial to find a way to not pay them than it is to make more money. Of course you want to stay on the legal side of the boundry, because jail is not a good thing -- ask Martha Stewart. Of course if she had done her stock trading with an account in Vanuatu or some place like that she almost certainly wouldn't have done jail time.  <br /> <br />This book talks about what companies do to reduce their tax burden. And it's a pretty good primer on how to do it. His philosophical point of view is another matter. He seems to feel that there is something basically imporal about this. Be assured though, that the politicians and the tax authorities know all about this. Knowing that this will happen, they simply raise taxes a few percent.	2005-08-31

And it doesn't seem like much has changed since. This area, from Turkey in the north, around the coast of the Med to the Egyption border is home (or a major center) of seemingly every religion in the world. And they all seem to hate each other.  <br /> <br />The government of the Lavant has usually been been subject to larger empires from the Egyptians to the Romans to the British. When not subjegated, it has been fractured into a mix of countries as it is today.  <br /> <br />Mr. Harris has done a splendid job of writing this history, description, and especially his concluding chapter, 'What's Next in the Lavant.' In this chapter he gives his impressions of the Israeli pullback from the settlements in Gaza, of the presence of the U.S. Military in Iraq, the high growth rate among the Arabs and more.	2005-08-31

Even more of the naval battle where Nelson came in. Here is a view of the invasion of Egypt left from the Egyptian side. His comments are rather surprising. It was very clear that the French military machine was vastly superior to the military forces then in Egypt. The French knowledge, science, technology was likewise admired by Al-Jabarti. On the other hand their claim to be the defender of the faith is obviously ridiculous, even though they did have a translation of the Koran.  <br /> <br />This particular edition of the book has been expanded in honor of Al-Jabarti's 250th birthday. The translation is by Shmuel Moreh of the Hebrew University, and  Robert L. Tignor provides an introduction giving an overview of the events.	2005-08-31

How to Protect your Assets from the Lawsuit Explosion	Books	5	6	7	N	N	I Only Wish I'd Had this Book a Few Years Ago	This is a book that I wish I'd had (and paid attention to) some years ago, that is, before being sued for divorce. I then had to learn what he says here through talking to attorneys (at $much per hour this is an expensive approach) and by writing my ex-wife big checks (but I got sole custody of the kid so it was worth it).  <br /> <br />Dr. Goldstein is talking about protecting what assets you have (after divorce that may be considerably less than you had before). When your major assets have been stripped away, you still need to protect what you have left, but some of the rules change. For instance liability insurance, if you carry a million dollar liability policy and have only $10,000 in assets, this may entice a hungry attorney to sue you while if you only had $20,000 in insurance, he may go look for another target.	2005-08-31

The advent of powerful personal computers has meant that the hand drawn, hand lettered, hand colored prints from the past no longer are what the printer wants. Instead the book now goes to the printer on a disk.  <br /> <br />Doing the work on a computer means software, and the author uses Photoshop. Most of the books on Photoshop are on manipulating photographs. Here the emphasis is on producing the art work for comic books. Photoshop obviously can do both, but the techniques and the particular tools used are different. For one thing there is a lot more information here on the printing process, including inks and paper.  <br /> <br />While the author uses Photoshop, which is the professional software used throughout the industry most of the techniques could be used with less expensive software packages, or you might try buying an older version of Photoshop through eBay.	2005-08-31

There has been tremendous progress made in materials science in the last twenty years or so. And a surprising amount of that work has been in materials used in fabrics. Fabrics, including rigid items like fiberglass or carbon fiber items, have been designed to handle a wide variety of tasks that previously either couldn't be done (the bouncing satellite on Mars), or were much more expensive, or were performed less adequately (sporting equipment).  <br /> <br />This book is a review of these advances. Ms. McQuaid is at the National Design Museum where she oversees a collection of more than thirty thousand textiles produced over 23 centuries. She has written much of the book, but has gotten contributions from a series of other textile experts from London, Canada, and of course the United States. The book is profusely illustrated to serve as an idea book of the types of items that can be manufactured with the new fabrics.	2005-08-31

Ms. Gillespie is pregnant (\\"I feel like a walking trash bag full of pig fat.\\") and has a little girl. All of a sudden the neighborhood of crack houses, whores and gunfights is no longer as much fun as when she was a Bleachy-Haired Honky Bitch. I tell ya, it's a bitch to have to grow up.  <br /> <br />And while most of us have to do that sooner or later (it's the short phase you go through before you realize you're old). Most of us don't have as good a way with words or a particular twist of mind to see quite as much humor in it as she does. Hard as it is to imagine, she's now a homeowner.  <br /> <br />This book is a reprint of articles that she wrote while going through this change. This adds a timeliness to her writing. And also a randomness as this week she is thinking of this problem and next week something else. Besides few of us read her normal publication, 'Creative Loafing.'  <br /> <br />Her next book will have to deal with the PTA,   the school system, all the joys of home ownership (plumbing, electric, paint), and of course the other mothers at the soccer games.  You'll just have to read this one while you wait.	2005-08-31

Bad intelligence, new Japanese tactics, horrible terrain, tired troops, vegetation that hid the rough terrain all combined to change the estimated three day campaign to put down a few hundred Japanese troops lasted for 71 days of truly vicious fighting by the 10,500 Japanese troops dug into the caves and hidden. It has even been argued that the invasion of Peleliu wasn't necessary as leaving it behind to wither on the vine would have done just as much good.  <br /> <br />None the less, Peleliu was taken. One of the bloodiest battles in the the Pacific, now largely forgotten. About the only good think you can say regarding Peleliu is that it tought some valuable lessons to the Marines. These were to be well used in subsequent campaigns where the Japanese again fought with similar tactics.  <br /> <br />Mr. Wright is becoming a well known author after publishing books on Tarawa and Iwo Jima.  <br /> <br />The front cover is from Peleliu and has become famous as 'The Two Thousand Yard Stare.\\"	2005-08-31

John Keegan was a Senior Lecturer at Sandhurst, the British equivalent of West Point. He produced a series of books on WW II and on other wars. This book is, in my opinion, his masterpiece.  <br /> <br />The book is profusely illustrated, and the illustrations are carefully tied into the text. The text itself tells what happened and when, but is also expanded to cover what other activities might be going on at that time. It also relates how that particular incident ties into the rest of the war.  <br /> <br />If there is any complaint you might make regarding this book, it would be that the war in the Pacific is not given as much coverage as the war against Germany. To be sure there are sections on the Pacific war, but they do not have nearly as many pages as the other.  <br /> <br />John Keegan is a supurb writer and this book is excellent.	2005-08-30

The Cold War was the longest period of peace in a bi-polar world since Roman times. Coming right after World War II, the biggest most disastrous war in history, the two superpowers spent fifty years threatening each other, competing in every way they could imagine, fighting wars through proxy (in the most part, Korea, Viet Nam and Afghanistan were exceptions), but not going to war.<br /><br />In retrospect, I wonder if this was because Washington and Moscow would have been the front lines, and the politicians would have been the first casualties. But at any case, there was no war.<br /><br />This book, one of a series on Living Through the Cold War is an excellent synopsis of life under the threat of nuclear war. A small book, it gives some of the speeches made by the political leaders of the time, it describes a couple of movies that gave significant impressions to large numbers of people.<br /><br />An excellent small concise history of a critical fifty years.	2005-08-30

In this book Mr. Hilton has carefully researched the pilgrims, their travels and activities once they reached America. He tells the tale with knowledge, respect and a writing style that really leaves you wondering if they will survive the next problem.  <br /> <br />Beyond the basic history, he provides some very interesting commentary on the long term effects of the document they all signed, the Mayflower Compact. He traces the sentiments, even some of the wording in the compact to the constitutions of other states, even to the United States Constitution. This was an aspect that I had never seen before.  <br /> <br />There is some puzzlement with why they landed in Massachusetts. One document that I have heard of says that it was because they were out of beer on board. The brewing process kills all pathogens in dirty water. This is one way to clean the water for a sea voyage. I have no idea if this is true, but it's a very good story.	2005-08-29

Sort of like the houses made of ticky-tacky in Daly City. Then once in a while you find a book like this one which features a series of buildings, that truly stand out.  <br /> <br />Located mostly in Nova Scotia, the architecture of Mr. MacKay-Lyons stands out as truly distinctive. Mostly of small rather inexpensive residences that are very difficult to make dramatic, here are examples of beautiful buildings. Further, most of them are small, and that means inexpensive. As he puts it, they do not have the big debt philosophy. You live in a tarpaper shack until you can afford siding.  <br /> <br />Besides houses, there are various commercial builings included from a dramatic theater, a Canadian embassy in Dhaka, Bangladesh, office buildings and university buildings.  <br /> <br />Finally, for several years he has hosted a gathering of interested people in building a structure on land he owns just to explore the limits of what can be done. These projects, called Ghost, are illustrated to give form to some of their ideas.  <br /> <br />Splendid book.	2005-08-29

Mr. Feldman has brought a lot of clear thinking, history, and a legal opinion to the separation of church and state in the US. Like a good legal opinion, much of the book is on prerequisites, i.e. history. Only in the last fifty pages or so does he get to the present and future.  <br /> <br />It is an interesting problem. We (that's the universal we, as everyone must think like I do) look at Islamic fundamentalists as somewhat crazy. Yet it seems that the American fundamentalists are not too far different in their blowing up of abortion clinics, or Pat Robertson wanting to kill the President of Venezuela (or maybe just kidnap him).  <br /> <br />It further seems that the more science learns about things, the more that some people reject the scientific evidence in favor of knowing in their own mind that God didn't do it that way.  <br /> <br />I'm not so sure that this isn't just a current fad. One day the Democrats will decide that they want to get back into power and start putting together candidates that can win. Perhaps then we'll go back to some form of sanity.	2005-08-29

Modern design techniques, including using computers to assist in the design and new materials with which to implement them have enabled yacht interiors to create a dramatic impression that simply wasn't possible before.  <br /> <br />In this book forty four yachts, from some of Europe's best designers are illustrated. They range from fairly small and just possibly affordable up to something that you're likely to see only in a James Bond movie. These are not yachts that I think you want to take through a hurricane, but what a craft to take to the local pub at say Monaco. Both sail and power boats are included.  <br /> <br />Oh well, maybe I can get a job as a deck hand on one of these.	2005-08-29

As such it covers every aspect of the job from jumping out of the airplace (static line or freefall), how to let yourself down if you are caught in a tree, and what to do once you get down to the ground (or water). It includes operations in both peacetime and in the combat zone.  <br /> <br />As you would expect from an official document written by the Air Force, it does not the most exciting style in the world. But you can rest assured that it is correct in the way it defines Air Force policy. I found myself looking at the book, deciding not to buy it, and then continuing to think about it as I wandered around the book store. I finally had to give up and go back to get it.

Well, maybe more than just a bit. Infinity doesn't necessarily mean a bunch, it means, mathematically, that a number cannot be determined.  <br /> <br />Infinity is not a new idea. Mathematicians have been working on them for hundreds of years. Physicists really got involved when Einstein published the Theory of Relativity in 1905. He talked about all kinds of things happening when you approached the speed of light. Then when you actually got to the speed of light his equations went to infinity. This was a bit disconcerting. One of the real reasons for the willingness of physicists to believe in string theory is that that the equations still show valid values at and above the speed of light.  <br /> <br />But enough on infinity. If you want to know more, here's the book for you. It discusses just about everything there is to know about infinity. It would be great for the high school math/physics teacher to use for examples.

In his all to brief a life Michael Rabin was a star that shined very brightly. He picked up a violin for the first time at age 7. In six months time he had outstripped the ability of his father (first chair violin with the New York Philharmonic) to teach him anything more. By his late teens he was argueablely the best violinist that America has ever produced. His career climbed to a very high peak, then declined. And at 35 he died under somewhat mysterious circumstances.   <br /> <br />Dr. Feinstein is a professor of psychiatry. Most of his previous publications have been in medical journals and the like. To this book he brings a love of music, years of admiration of Michael Rabin. I think he also has a better than usual understanding of the pulls, pleasures and pressures that the life of a performer puts on a child that never had a chance to develop normally.  <br /> <br />Michael paid a very high price for his violin mastery. Shy and awkward away from his violin, he never really matured into adulthood. His relationships with his recording managers, his agent, with adults in general was difficult. In the thirty years since his death his star has faded further until he is largely forgotten except among a very few. <br /> <br />This is the first authorized biography of Michael Rabin. In its writing the author had the cooperation of family and friends. It is likely to remain the last work on Michael Rabin's life.	2005-08-27

The very title of this book 'WildBrews' explains why. The traditional lambic beers of Belgium are produced using wild yeast. While you can find wild yeast everywhere, the ones you get here in the US produce truly bad beers. Each batch you produce will be different, sometimes totally different, but in my experience always bad.  <br /> <br />The yeast that seem to abound in Belgium produce beers with a consistency that has lasted for generations. I don't know if it is true, but I have always suspected that clumps of yeast would gather together rather like cob webs or dust balls around the brewery and fall or be blown into the mix. I was rather surprised at the appearance of the breweries in this book as they seemed clean and sanitary.  <br /> <br />Lambics have not been among the most popular beers made in this country. Only a few micro breweries produce lambics, the most popular around here is New Belgium from Ft. Collins, CO.  <br /> <br />You can, of course make your own Lambics, the recipies start on page 255 of this book. But you don't do it with the natural yeast floating around the air in your garden. You buy Lambic yeast from a couple of companies.  <br /> <br />One scary thought. Beer was invented some 5,000 years ago. Probably some grain got wet, sprouted, dried out, got wet again and some yeast got into the mix. Boy that must have been bad stuff. At that time it was all wild yeast. Personally I'm glad that we've had 5,000 years of yeast development. <br /> <br />This is an enjoyable book, almost a travelogue through Belgium beers.	2005-08-27

(That's Heinlein's book not that horrible movie they made.) A good part of the book is on the training and philosophy of a soldier. It has been brought up to date and this time the target is not the bugs of a far off planet, but the Earth.  <br /> <br />Specifically it's a future earth where people have given up virtually every freedom for the illusion of safety. Sort of like the Patriot's Act run amuck. And what then happens with a relatively small (200) group of terrorists (If you're on Earth's side) or patriots (If you're on Freehold's side) commit a series of coordinated acts of sabotage.  <br /> <br />I'm not so sure that the relatively little ammount of damage (in percentage of population killed) they did would cause that much disruption. I was living very near New York when 9/11 occurred and the average people handled it very well. But I am not the author.

Generals who trained, studied and would be expert in fighting the Russians across the fields of central Germany. Equipment, like the Hum-V that would be perfect behind the lins in Germany. Rear echelon lifers (career soldiers) (also known as REMF's) who are primarily interested in getting promoted and who will not be out where the guns are really loaded.   <br /> <br />Thanks Crawford for bringing this to us. Best of luck in the future.   <br /> <br />If only those people didn't have all the oil in the world....	2005-08-27

There are lots of ways to make money in real estate. Some people swear by buying rental properties. Some want apartment houses or commerical property, warehouses, storage units or whatever. There are those who buy run down building and fix them up. And there are those who build houses. Some books talk about buying distressed properties at auctions or estate sales, neglecting that there are a lot of people looking for deals like this, especially the real estate agents in the area. This book covers all of these ways and many more. It's a generalized coverage of real estate investing in all of its aspects.     The author, Stuart Leland Rider is a long time real estate developer and investor. He writes from personal experience. He covers nearly every area you could ask from why real estate at all to providing a CD with customizable forms and spreadsheets to give you a start on the analysis that you need to do.     There's just one point I'd recommend that he doesn't mention. That point is: if you're seriously thinking about real estate, go get a job working in real estate. Probably the easiest job to get and the one that will give you the most general background is to be a salesman at a small real estate agency. But if this is not your bag, go to work for a contractor, a handyman, or whatever your particular interest might be. You'll learn a lot. This may be things that you can learn from this book, but if you actually see them in action you'll understand them better.	2005-08-27

The differences were, of course, land and water. Napoleon had few rivals on land. But he came up against Nelson and the Royal Navy. He went no further in that direction.  <br /> <br />This book is put out by the British National Maritime Museum which has an emense collection of artifacts from that time period. Most of the book is more or less a catalog of a special exhibit put together at the Museum commemorating the 200th anniversary of Nelson's victory and death at the Battle of Trafalgar.  <br /> <br />The pictures in the book are the closest that most of us will ever get to the exhibit, but the photography and printing is of such a quality that you feel like you came close to seeing the exhibit. Further, the commentary in the book is probably more extensive than what you normally see at an exhibit. Each chapter in the book has a few pages of explanation of what the overall chapter was trying to cover.  <br /> <br />It's a beautiful book.	2005-08-27

Or, then again, what he is really referring to is perhaps only a dream of what should have been. At any rate, the old story is going to work for a giant company, working your entire life for that same company, married (forever, no divorcing), 2.4 kids, retiring at 65 and kicked the bucket five years later.  <br /> <br />Instead, my parents worked for the same company for 30 years, the company got sold, both companies had too many people and my father was out of a job in his late fifties. His company retirement plan was out the window. You had best plan for a life with some ups and downs like this.  And Mr. Astre does an excellent job of presenting you with the options that exist in today's world. He talks about all the different kinds of investing, the implications of the IRS being your partner for life, basically he covers the classical approach to financial planning the will work for some people.  <br /> <br />I particularly like his twelve 'Prosperity Points.\\" These are things like protecting yourself from Lawsuits, Audit-Proofing your Tax Return. My only complaint would be that it doesn't go quite far enough. He needs a few more points. I'd suggest:  <br /> <br />13. Divorce - If you're male, your savings, retirement, etc. get wiped out. If you're female, you don't get anything. Sound stupid, go talk to ten divoced people.  <br /> <br />14. You plan to spend your retirement driving around the country in your motor home. Today oil is $67 a barrel. Suppose it goes to $200 and fuel is $10 a gallon, do you still like that motor home? <br /> <br />15. Retirement is fun. Nursing homes for the last few weeks/months/years are not, and they are very expensive.  <br /> <br />16. Can you retire? I can't. I started my own business and work 50-60 hours a week, but then take off 3-4 months a year. I haven't touched savings.	2005-08-27

This makes them targets for counterfeiting. So a special series of processes has been developed to poduce such documents.  <br /> <br />The things that can be controlled in the printing process are essentially the paper, the ink, and the printing equipment/process. This book discusses all of these and more as it talks about the technology of making documents secure enough that forgeries can be immediately recognized by people with little training.  <br /> <br />In recent years the advent of color copying has forced a whole series of changes in the security printing business. This means that new technologies such as inks visible under special lighting conditions, micro printing, holograms and many other techniques have become available and are covered here.  <br /> <br />Finally there is a section on marketing security printing along with some discussion on the risks involved.	2005-08-26

Books	5	37	56	N	N	Good Solid Traditional Financial Advice	I like the introduction to this book. It says simply: 'Can You Retire.\\" And on that page she asks a half dozen questions. Perhaps the most important is 'how long do you think you will live.'  <br /> <br />There're another couple of questions that go along with that which she didn't ask, and which is hard to answer, that question is: 'what do you think your terminal medical costs will be.' Living in a nursing home for the last several years would be very expensive. Going in a car accident while you're still working is an entirely different situation.  <br /> <br />Another question is can you retire. I can't. I'm old enough to but couldn't imagine not working so started my own company and work 50-60 hours a week (I also take 2-3 months off a year for vacation).  <br /> <br />I also take exception to the estimates she quotes of needing 75% to 80% of your normal income at retirement. Somewhere along there your house gets paid off and that's a big savings. Then too, perhaps you don't drive nearly as much and your car lasts a lot longer. And the kids get out of college and that expense goes away. No house payment, no car payment and no college payment and life gets a whole bunch cheaper.  <br /> <br />Finally Ms. Savage gives you the conventional wisdom here. It's good solid advice if the future works out as planned.  <br /> <br />But in a divorce, if you're a man, expect to get all your savings, your house, etc. wiped out; if you're a woman, don't expect to get anything.  <br /> <br />And pay a lot of attention to the price of oil. $67 a barrel today, what happens when it goes to say $200. What kind of car, house do you want then?  <br /> <br />What happens with a really big recession or massive inflation -- a 1929 like recession or an inflation like what happened to the Confederate money my southern ancestors saved.   <br /> <br />In planning for retirement you are making guesses as to what the future holds, it's easy to predict the future, but it's very hard to be right.	2005-08-26

Katherine and Peter Vessenes have been coaches and consultants to the financial service industry with more than forty years of experience between them. They have worked with, consulted to, learned from many of the industries superstars who are earning more than $1 million per year.  <br /> <br />They have carefully reduced what they have learned into eight 'prosperity factors.' These are given and defined and further illustrated by reporting the improvement that each factor has given in at least one true to life incident.  <br /> <br />In this book they have distilled their whole consulting approach, their teaching seminars into writing.  They have included more than 30 sample forms/documents that the superstars have used.  <br /> <br />This is one of the few books aimed specifically at this industry, it has specific industry tips that you won't find anywhere else.	2005-08-26

Zamba, when very young, was found near death in Zambia and was given to the author. The author and Zamba lived and worked together for eighteen years. Zamba was a movie star. He worked with numerous stars and was the origin of several amusing annecdotes.  <br /> <br />The second part of the book you get kind of between the lines and is about his travels in Africa. Africa is a mess. Take what he says as being the good side. Since then has come the AIDS pandemic, drug resistant TB, and even more wars with no reason for them apparent to us outsiders.  <br /> <br />Finally, and perhaps most important this is the story of Mr. Helfer's approach to animal training. He was among the first to use affection and kindness to train wild animals. This approach worked wonders, and produced a series of animals that worked in many areas.  <br /> <br />A most interesting book.	2005-08-26

Only since 1995 however has the price/performance ratio of sensors and processors been good enough to allow extremely sophisticated devices using DSP to become consumer items.  <br /> <br />In 1995 the first really popular digital camera, the Casio QV-10 entered the market and became a great success. Since then, the technology has grown at a phenomenal rate driven by the huge volumes of cameras being sold. This advance shows no sign of slowing down.  <br /> <br />This book is on the basic foundations of digital still cameras, the image sensor and the techniques used in processing the image coming from the sensor. It includes both the theory and the concepts of both the hardware being used and the software that ties everything together to make a useful system.  <br /> <br />This field is one that is rapidly changing. As a result Dr. Nakamura has gotten a group of people from various companies to write chapters on their own area of expertise. The companies by whom these contributors are employed is a who's who of the digital camera field including: Konica Minolta, Canon, Olympus, Fuji and various specialized companies that work in this area. Dr. Nakamura is employed by Micron, a major semi-conductor company.  <br /> <br />This is not a book on how to take pictures, this is a book on what happens underneath when you press the button. It is highly technical, designed for engineers.	2005-08-26

The web must be a lot like the old west was rumored to be. Except that there doesn't even appear to be a sheriff anywhere around. All of us have to build our own little forts for protection against the bad guys. One of the best forts you can build uses the Cisco ASA/PIX Security Appliance.  <br /> <br />You can, of course, set up the equipment without anything but the manual. But this book goes into a lot more background that is very nice to know. It starts with why they might want into your network. (I couldn't imagine why anyone would want into mine until they started attacking to use my equipment for  re-mailing and bandwidth.) It then goes into they types of attacks that might be used against you.  <br /> <br />It's probably impossible to build a totally secure system unless it isn't connected to the outside world in any way at all. But when your users want things like e-mail, web access and more, you've got to do something. The Cisco approach at least makes it very difficult for all but the most determined bad buy to get into your system.  <br /> <br />The author has been working on the Cisco approach to security since 1996, he understands it pretty well and has a good writing style to make it understandable to you. Highly Recommended!	2005-08-26

Arcadia Bublishing has about forty titles in their Images of Rail series. Each book has about 200 photographs of the railroad or area covered by the book. I wouldn't have thought that there would have been this many photographs still around. Their authors must a particular nose to go out and smell photographs hidden in all kinds of places.  <br /> <br />Anyway, this book is on rail service in and around Toledo. In the 150 years since rail service began there, Toledo has been served by 35 railroads (down to four now). The photographs show Toledo's rail services through bridges, roundhouses, stations, yards, and of course equipment.  <br /> <br />I find something wonderful about looking at a photographic history like this. These pictures tell a story different than all the descriptions that anyone could write. They show how it really was. The casual things like the man working in the switch tower wearing a suit. The ladies all in long dresses. The ships hauling coal and iron ore that still have sails.  <br /> <br />All these images of times past, that will never come back. The buildings, the equipment that later got torn down or demolished. The book is both a joy and a sadness.	2005-08-26

This includes radar, sonar, ultra-sound or other medical imaging system, and more. Once the data is captured (the realm of the pure enginnering types) some kind of processing has to be done to convert the data (a string of 0's and 1's) into something that comes across to us as information.  <br /> <br />Now the problem moves to the mathematician who has to decide how to best take this data and process it to get it in a form that provides useful information. The basic mathematical techniques are not new (Fourier did his work about 1800, Hilbert around 1900) but nor are they the things you normally study in high school. As digital computers have become possible, new techniques have been developed to speed the processing task.  <br /> <br />This book is positioned at the intersection of the engineer producing the signal, and the programmer who has to do something with it. It is the solid mathematical background to signal processing. It is basically a selection of the mathematical techniques needed to do signal processing.	2005-08-25

What that really means is that it's not nearly as crowded with tourists. Still prime wine growing country the first vinyards date from the middle 1800's. It also seems that wine people tend to not be poor. The houses from the old vinyards are classical and elegant. The houses from the new vinyards are not bad either.  <br /> <br />In this book you'll see a lot of kitchens with Viking type stovetops. There aren't many stoves from Sears purchased second hand. The book is a description of some of the more elegant houses in Sonoma Valley. It is profusely photographed by Steven Brooke an architectural photographer of reknown. His works include books on Rome, Jerusalem, Savannah, Napa and others. His pictures have a warm, creamy look that I find very inviting. The description that goes with the houses combines descriptive information with history and tales of the people who buile/remodeled them.  <br /> <br />The book is about what you would expect of a coffee table book on a region: high quality pictures, high quality writing, high quality printing.	2005-08-25

It took about two pages in chapter one before I understood what he was saying.  <br /> <br />He uses as an example a sight that sells eyeglasses. Then he says, people shopping for eye glasses might need to expand the font size being displayed by their browser. That made good sense. Then he showed how a common programming technique would prevent the user from doing that. That makes good sense. Why would you want to do anything that could cause him to move away?  <br /> <br />He then discusses how the possible fixes would be handled by various browsers including a different image shown by IE version 5 and IE version 6.  <br /> <br />Going just through the first chapter I learned a lot that I hadn't seen anywhere else. Then the rest of the chapters taught me even more.  <br /> <br />This fellow knows what he is talking about. This isn't a book for the absolute beginner, it's aimed at the intermediate level user who understands what HTML is all about and has at least some knowledge of CSS and XHTML.

Then a few minutes ago I went on-line to e-Bay looking for a RAID controller for my web server. The picture of the first unit was so dark that it almost looked like a big black blob. The image was way underexposed.  You can see exactly what I'm talking about in the center picture on page 62.  <br /> <br />The second unit had a picture taken using a flash. It was a straight on shot that caused the light from the flash to bounce straight back at the camera. The entire center of the item was pure white from the reflected light. All you could see was the few items at each end of the card. You can see exactly what I'm talking about in the picture on page 91 of this book.  <br /> <br />A little simple math. To shoot either pictures of the RAID controllers would take say a minute. To shoot a much better picture might take three minutes. That's two additional minutes. Let's say that the better picture caused the item to sell for $5 more. That's $5 for two minutes. That's equivalent to $150 an hour. That's pretty good pay.  <br /> <br />There are lots of good books on photography. This one talks about the standard photographic stuff, but explains in simple terms how it will help sell the item on e-Bay.	2005-08-25

Perhaps this came from travellers there during or right after the war when good ingredients were hard to obtain. But it's certainly not true. Restaurants like 'Gordon Ramsay,' only a few blocks from Buckingham Palace are the reason.  <br /> <br />The best places in London serve foods that have a French flair, but which aren't really French. They are English. And the first thing that this book did for me was make me decide that I need to make another trip over there. There must be some excuse I can think of that will let the IRS pay for the trip.  <br /> <br />But the next thing the book did was take care of dinner tonight. I found some pretty good looking Tuna at the supermarket today. I note in his book say that the best meat comes from the tail end of the fish. I asked the lady at the supermarket if this came from the tail end. She gave me a very funny look. Anyway it's marinated tuna salad for dinner tonight.  <br /> <br />Now I'm going to stop writing and flip through the book looking for something for desert.	2005-08-25

In it the author has taken a solidly provable mathematical theorem that makes no sense at all when you say it and used it as an example to describe some pretty elegant mathematics.  <br /> <br />The area he talks about is given in the title. Of course if you're in the know it's called the Banach-Tarski theorem. It says that you can take a solid object like for instance a pea. You then cut it into pieces and you can then reassemble the pieces and get something as big as the sun.  <br /> <br />Obviously untrue, but you can prove it mathematically. Of course you can mathematically prove that a bumblebee can't fly. The bumblebee doesn't know math, so he just keeps on flying. There are a lot of mathematical things, E=MC-Squared for instance, that just can't possibly be true.  <br /> <br />Written for the non-mathematician, this book is a discussion on the history of the B-T theorem. But it's at a level that my mother isn't going to understand it.  <br /> <br />For the casual mathematican, a delightful read.	2005-08-25

As a male I'm sure that I see things just a bit differently than the lady who handed me this book.  <br /> <br />It seemed to me that Heath was a perfectly reasonable man. I liked the deal he proposed at first: 'You've got one chance. Tomorrow night. Hit me with your best candidate. Introduce us, stay at the table twenty minutes exactly, then take her away. Now get the hell out of my office while you're ahead.'  <br /> <br />Isn't that a reasonable way to have a first meeting.

I like the High Desert country so well that I moved here a few years ago. I couldn't afford to get something as elegant as these hideaways, but I was quite plesantly surprised to get this book and see that I'd been to several of these. Even better, she has discovered some that I didn't know about.  <br /> <br />I've also been to several others that she doesn't mention, but as she says, 'You may discover your own special hideaway in this book or you may not. There are a lot more out there. One is waiting for you. Go find it.'  <br /> <br />I guess that we all have our likes and ideas about where we want to go. She has found some nice places even in (or very near) cities. You certainly won't go wrong in picking up some of her recommendations. In comparing her book to the places I've been, she is right on the money. The photographs are better than good, the activities/amenities are well described.

She specialized in absent healing, mainly with sufferers of cancer and AIDS.'  <br /> <br />She also claims to be a confidante and healer to Princess Diana during the last five years of her life. This then is a 'doctor tells all' (although not a doctor in the traditional sense) book.  <br /> <br />I had heard before that Diana had a borderline personality disorder. This book makes it ever more clear that she was not the most mentally healthy person in the world. It is sad that with all of her wealth, beauty and power that she wasn't able to get help.  <br /> <br />Then again, borderlines usually don't want help.	2005-08-24

The authors have collected illustrations on every conceivable market from camel caravans crossing the Sahara to the latest scenes on Wall Street. You don't think of a coffee table picture book as having the world's financial markets as a suitable subject, but that's what this is.  <br /> <br />The book goes back a few thousand years and covers the basic development of trade that began in the fertile cresent. Major epochs since then are given chapters. These include the depression, the wars, OPEC and so on.  <br /> <br />As big as the book is, 350 pages, 10 x 12 inches and six pounds in weight, I'm reluctant to use the term 'concise history.' But's that's really what it is. The book, both because of its illustrations and it writing is very good, it's enjoyable reading, much better than what you would expect to find in the usual coffee table book.	2005-08-23

Most of these new hotels have been designed for a close, harmonious fit to their surroundings. This is particularly striking in some of the hotels built in mountain or desert locations.  <br /> <br />Other hotels built in cities for instance, do not have unduely striking exteriors but make up for it by the attention paid to the design of the interior areas both public and in the individual rooms.  <br /> <br />The selected hotels are scattered widely around the world, showing that such design is not restricted to one locale or even to one continent.  <br /> <br />Seven of the hotels might be considered to be the design experiments, where the basic structure or use of the building stretches design to the limits. These are not your basic Motel 6 designs.	2005-08-23

In this book, gone are the traditional views we have in mind of the small sleeping mat on the floor of the traditional Japanese bedroom.  <br /> <br />Instead, these homes are primarily located further south: Bali, Singapore, Thailand. Here the beds are more in the traditional western style, elevated above the floor with traditional pillows and coverings. Still however, the location in Asia, with Asian architects and customers provides for design touches that are both striking and subtlely different from the standard American design. For instance many of the designs have updated appearing mosquito netting. This reflects more on the history of the location rather than the current needs in locations where these homes are located.  <br /> <br />Beautifully photographed and printed, this book will serve as an idea book for ideas that could well be incorporated into standard western designs.	2005-08-23

In looking at the new books that are coming out it seems that our country has developed a polarized view of Iraq that has simply continued the 'Bush is Wonderful' / 'Bush is Satan' views being expressed before the last election.  <br /> <br />You can pretty well tell what Mr. Glantz's views are from the title of the book. Before you can say that America 'Lost' you have to make the presumption that America 'won' or 'had' Iraq at some time. This view comes from a feeling Mr. Glantz had right after the end of formal hostilities.  <br /> <br />Mr. Glantz is a leftist leaning radio announcer. At the beginning of the war he warned of dire consequences of the US attacking Iraq. Immediately after hostilities formally ended, he visited Iraq and was told by people he interviewed that they were very thankful of the US for taking out Saddam. This was, in his mind, when we 'won' Iraq.  <br /> <br />More recently, as the difficulties between the Sunni, Shiite, and Kurddish have become more pronounced, as al-Queda has sent in more fighters, he went back to Iraq and in the interviews then he reversed his decision back to the pre-war anti-Bush stance.  <br /> <br />Mr. Glantz's reports on interviews are very good and interesting. His conclusions less so. The reports of one reporter, talking to a very limited number of people cannot reflect the views of a whole country.  <br /> <br />Is there just possibly a bit of comfort for Mr. Glantz to return to the anti-Bush feelings that he held previously.  <br /> <br />I notice that in the index of the book, neither al-Queda nor oil is listed. I'm not sure what this means either.	2005-08-23

If one defines greatness as the ability to create a series of masterpieces over a broad range of musical media, then Dvorak was, demonstrably and without exaggeration, the greatest composer of the last half of the nineteenth century.' This quotation from Mr. Hurwitz leaves litle to question about his opinion of Dvorak. And in the last half of the nineteenth century when Brahms, Mahler, Wagner, Tchaikovshy, Verdi, Strauss, and Sibelius were working. Not a bad company with which to be associated.  <br /> <br />Mr. Hurwitz has a reputation for taking the work of a composer (Wagner, Mahler, Mozart) and providing an insight into the music, it's history, it's derivation to give the reader a better understanding of the music you are hearing.  <br /> <br />The book is about 250 pages long, and the book comes with two full length audio CD's containing 22 tracks of Dvorak's work. These serve to illustrate Mr. Hurwitz's commentary and analysis.  <br /> <br />A book of this length and two classical CD's for this price is extraordinary in itself.	2005-08-22

It is therefore to see this book come out with a somewhat different view of what the earlier Greek philosophers meant by the word phusis means.<br /><br />Usually translated as nature, the author has come to the concusiion that the ancient philosophes used the word to mean 'origin, process and result.'<br /><br />The author is clearly an expert on the ancient or classical Greek language, including some very obscure details of the grammer. He has used these to make his own translations of some of the earliest philosophical works. The differences in his translations are subtle, but they impact the meanings some of the earliest philosphers : Anazimander, Zenophanes, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocies, Anaxagoras, Leucippus and Democritus when they were using the word. The meaning of the word, obviously, can change the meaning of the entire work.<br /><br />This is not an introductory text on Greek philosophical, but provides an interesting insight into some of these points.	2005-08-22

In October 1957 the Soviet Union launched the first orbiting earth satellite. This was before the United States was even scheduled to launch their first one. Then the Soviet Sputnik was so big. Then the Vanguard rocket NASA was using lifted off, went up beautifully for a few feet then beautifully went back down for several feet before blowing up.<br /><br />Then John Kennedy gave NASA a mission - to take a man to the moon and return him saftly to the earth. It was a beautiful time. The country was filled with pride as one accomplishment after another took us to the moon.<br /><br />Since then it almost seems as if NASA has been floundering. The big question has been between unmanned equipment and sending men up.<br /><br />Another argument centers around the entire concept of a big agency like NASA. For a cost in the $20 million range, Burt Rutan ([...]) built Space Ship One and successfully flew it into space. NASA couldn't even write a proposal to buy such a ship for $20 million.<br /><br />This book talks about the  trouble NASA has had in defining a mission and makes a few guesses about the future.	2005-08-22

Now we are approaching the 200 year anniversary of his death at the Battle of Trafalgar. And we are hearing again of his famous signal 'England expects every man will do his duty.' And his famous last words 'Thank God I have done my duty.'  <br /> <br />In this new book, nine noted historians contributed articles. Each views Nelson's life and legacy in a different light. In Part 1 of the book the subjects are Seamanship, leadership, orgiginality, Friendship, Freemasonry, Fraternity, Manliness, patriotism and body politics.  <br /> <br />Of particular interest was Kate Williams article Nelson and Women which discusses how Nelson was marketed to the female consumer of the time. This included romance novels, fantasies about how sailors whould behave, and various consumer items offered for sale. This is a view of early nineteenth century England not seen before.  <br /> <br />Part 2 of the book goes into the Nelson legacy. This legacy didn't just happen, it was carefully constructed by the British Navy, Government and others. They did a good job, the legacy has now lasted for 200 years and shows no sign of dimenishing.  <br /> <br />A most interesting book that discusses parts about Nelson that haven't been emphasized.	2005-08-22

He built it up into a nice sized company, only to see it eventually fail and for the standard reason - the owner believed more in the dream than in the nature of actually running a business.  <br /> <br />Like most entrepreneurs he took a close look as what happened and started over determined not to make these same mistakes. He also did a better analysis of what went wrong tham most.  <br /> <br />His analysis of the failure of his own company has been digested into this book. It's one of the better that talk about not trying to fix a giant corporation, but what an individual can do in his own small business.	2005-08-21

Before World War II started he had contacted William 'Wild Bill' Donovan and asked him to set up a foreign intelligence agency along the lines of what the British were doing. He formed just what FDR wanted and it was called the Office of Strategic Services, a non-descript name that could have meant anything. ==The OSS was a crazy agency that grew like crazy, eventually reaching some 10,000 people. All in all, the OSS provided some useful intelligence. They performed some useful operations during the war. They trained some very good people. This book will give you all the details. ==This whole concept was done over the intense opposition of J. Edgar Hoover who fought with every skill he had to prevent what he considered competition with the FBI. ==After FDR died, Truman and Donovan didn't get along all tht well. Truman shut down the OSS, but shortly thereafter realized that the Navy, the Army and the FBI along with all the others didn't play well together so he set up the CIA a few months later. ==Of course 9/11 taught us that none of them play well together now.	2005-08-21

Pretty, but not really applicable to the desert scene where I live.  <br /> <br />Looking inside I realized that their definition of terrace is really something like a transitional area, not enclosed in the house, but closely associated with and connecting the house to the outside.  <br /> <br />Then I realized that this is an concept about my house that I had been thinking about for some time. A place to sit, talk, relax a bit in the cool of the evening. Kind of like what we used to do on grandmothers porch.  <br /> <br />The houses here are broken down into three general categories:   <br /> <br />Urban, some of which are more like the little garden areas in back of houses/restaurants in city centers like New York or London.  <br /> <br />Countryside, where some striking scenes are shown even with flat farm or desert landscapes. We think of terraces being on the side of a hill with an expansive view. But here are some very interesting ones that are not.  <br /> <br />Finally there are Seaside Terraces, where indeed there are some dramatic pictures.  <br /> <br />The book certainly gave me some ideas about what I'm going to do in my front yard.	2005-08-21

Stephen Sondheim would probably say something similar.     He has acknowledged being influenced by classical music, Broadway, Tin Pan Alley, Hollywood and many more. In the end though, Sondheim's work has taken these together and produced something uniquely his own. The results speak for themselves: West Side Story, Gypsy, Sunday in the Park with George, Sweeney Todd, Into the Woods, Do I Hear a Waltz and the list goes on and on. In 2004 alone there was the first Broadway production of Assassins, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (London), The Frogs (Lincoln Center), Passion, Pacific Overtures.     This book though, is not a description of what he has done, it's an in depth analysis of the way his music came about. The author teaches music at Dartmouth. His analysis, aided by Sondheim himself talks not only about the origins of music, but the way Sondheim goes about developing a song. It's a fascinating look at the creative process.	2005-08-21

Just about every other page says 'more secure,' 'no viruses,' etc. I've got to say that I don't much care about the free aspects, but it was a really lousy weekend. I'm having to start over from scratch, reload Windows, reload the aps, etc.  <br /> <br />While it was reloading, I turned to Chapter 23 in this book, 'A Friendly, Free and Powerful Alternatives to Windows XP.

The sick machine will have finished reloading Windows XP in approximately 31 minutes. While it sits there, I'm going get the Friendly, Free and Powferful etc. system and give it a try.  <br /> <br />I don't need more weekends like this. This is what I needed out of this book.

During railroadings heyday of passenger travel, there were some 250 railroad depots in northwestern Ohio alone. Many of them were in the standard shape favored by that particular railroad. These, of course, came in several standard sizes depending on the size and nature of the city. The larger towns and cities had structures that were built to show off the strength and power of the road. Lots of marble, polished wood, elegant architecture were a visible symbol that the railroad had arrived and that the horse and buggy or stagecoach days were gone forever.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there's a sad part to the tale also as the railroads passenger carrying days followed the horse drawn vehicles that went before. I don't know just how many pictures there are in this book, probably a couple of hundred, most of the pages have two photographs each. The captions of most of the end with words like 'torn down in 1972,' 'destroyed by fire, not rebuilt.' A few, just a few say things like 'moved to the town's city park,' or 'converted to a restaurant.'  <br /> <br />The book ends with a chapter 'Reuse of Depots.' The chapter is all to small, but it's good to see that at least some of the old structures have found new uses.	2005-08-21

People lived a farming, fishing existance.  <br /> <br />Second, the sense of using natural surfaces: wood, fabric, thatch and some rudamentory manufactured items: paper, pottery, cast iron makes for a room appearance that we could all strive to find.  <br /> <br />Third, as with any architecture book, the ideas of style, decoration, and utility in a small space give one ideas that may well be applicable in housing designs that we may be considering.  <br /> <br />These houses have a utility and a simplicity that is all their own. It is great to see what they have done with simple items and a rather small amount of money. These are not the million dollar homes often seen in architecture books, these are lived in.  <br /> <br />Beautiful book.	2005-08-20

The movie/entertainment business doesn't have a clue about what to do with the digital revolution. Movie distribution, shipping a film to your local theater was a way of getting lots of bits to a place. And in the days of 28.8 modems, that was about the only way to get a lot of data anywhere.  <br /> <br />Now we look at a house. The TV is connected to cable or satellite with megabits of data. Companies have lots of infrastructure to get this data distributed. The computer is connected to DSL or a cable modem with maybe a megabit of data. This is a general purpose bandwidth that you get to specify what data you want.  <br /> <br />With better compression techniques and the ever increasing bandwidth movies, music, all the things promised by Darknet (Page 45 or the book) are going to come into the house. It's just going to take a way for someone to make a profit out of it. <br /> <br />This book talks about Hollywood fighting a battle against evolving technology. Put your money on technology, not the old approach.  <br /> <br />Good book about the state of the art as it exists today. But wait a few years.	2005-08-19

The Clay prizes were offered on May 24, 2000. They offer a million dollars (yes, $1,000,000) for the solution to each of seven problems. Of course the first problem is the Riemann hypothesis, which people have been trying to solve for about a hundred and fifty years.  <br /> <br />This book is light and entertaining.

It first gives some background of the development of the bases, the activities going on at the time, about like what the books on Pearl have to say about Navy activities. Then it moves on to the attack itself.  <br /> <br />All of the books talk about the radar site that picked up the incomming planes. It turns out that there were multiple radars that detected the incomming planes. But to no avail. The Air Warning system is described in some length. It was a pretty good plan. But on December 7th most of the little boxes had people in them. Much is made of the  officer in the air defense center telling the radar operators not to worry about the blip on there screen.

His view was that students could read the text and he didn't need to go tell them what the text said, that's what the book is for. Instead, the teacher should go beyond the book. Answer questions, propose questions that would generate discussions on what the text talked about.  <br /> <br />As a physicist/mathematician he viewed the world just a bit differently. Most of his work was oriented around economic theory viewed from a mathematical perspective. The basic nature of his work set up the foundation from which at least three Nobel's were awarded.  <br /> <br />This book is  not a detailed mathematical explanation of the economics, it is the story of a man's life, a most interesting man, told through an explanation of the economic theories.  <br /> <br />It's a biography, but it's not a 'born of humble parents' story of a life. It's what he did, it's what he lived. Well researched, well written, it's a nice book to read.	2005-08-19

This makes several presumptions that have to fall in line exactly right. For instance some products (like in the medical field) take longer than a year to go through the approval cycle. Electronics have to have FCC testing, perhaps CSA (Canada), all of which takes time. Plastic parts may have to have a mold made, that takes time, and if it isn't right the first time, well you get the idea.  <br /> <br />What Mr. Debelak says is that if you start from day one with the right product, use some of the new techniques he talks about (outsourcing the production to a contract manufacturer for instance), then if all the gods are smiling at you, maybe you can do it in a year.  <br /> <br />Ignoring his one year time frame, his book is right on the money in a lot of areas. His practical advice on patents is dead right, they may or may not be of value to your particular venture.  <br /> <br />His comments on financing are excellent, but here you're going to need a good bit of luck. There are a lot of people looking for financing.  <br /> <br />In fact, everything about starting a new product require a good bit of luck. Just remember it's been done before, and it will be done again. Here are a good set of guidelines to get you started.	2005-08-19

Of course a skilled web programmer can do any of these applications. All it takes is time, thinking about the problem, writing, debugging, checking out, and making the customer (who may be the programmer him/her self) happy.  <br /> <br />Today there are several scritping languages that can be used to tie the web site together with a database for storing the data. One set of software that you can use is PHP and MySQL. Both of these are highly advanced products (often combined with Linux and the Apache web server for a high performance web server with no software cost). You might use these to write the applications you need.  <br /> <br />But when we are talking about common applications, these have been done over and over. In this book, six applications are included, working and ready for you to install. Once you get them operational, you can easily modify them to suit your particular needs. The code for the application is given, both printed in the book and included on the CD that comes with the book. The code is then carefully explained both conceptually as to what the app does, and line by line so you know what's going on and modify it as needed.  <br /> <br />The application included are:  <br /> <br />two login apps  <br />shopping cart  <br />content management system (allows users to publish documents on your system)  <br />Online bulletin board.  <br /> <br />The book is intended to be self standing, but if you know nothing about PHP or MySQL you might look for the same authors book PHP & MySQL for Dummies.	2005-08-19

All of a sudden I was faced with the idea of raising lots of money instead of just the small amounts we need to put on individual productions.  <br /> <br />To my surprise, although I guess I shouldn't have been, Chapter 7 is on Capital Campaigns. She summarizes them as: 'unique, occasional, exhausting, exciting, and productive; they focus organizations on a particular goal during a finite period of time and allow us to sharpen our sense of purpose and impact.' To that I can only say: Yup!  <br /> <br />Ms. Grace has obviously been there, done that, not only in raising money for capital, but every other kind of fundraising activity as well.  <br /> <br />This book is well written, and it positioned at a higher level than most fundraising books. By that I mean that she treats fundraising as almost an art form. Something where you don't need to feel like you're begging for a handout. Highly recommended.	2005-08-19

The dollar standard is inherently flawed and increasingly unstable. Its collapse will be the most important economic event of the twenty-first century.  <br /> <br />Mr. Duncan is based in Asia and has a first hand view of what he is talking about as well as the theoretical background to understand what's happening. Or at least he has a different view than we have here. ==His comments from a strictly monetary standpoint are pretty good. But I'm afraid that his conclusions don't quite agree with mine.  <br /> <br />First, one thing he urges as at least a partial solution is a Global Minimum Wage. You gotta be kidding. France can't even agree with the rest of Europe on how to do things. Are you really saying that the kid in Zimbabwe driving an ox team dragging firewood is to get paid the same as someone working in a factory in Taiwan?  <br /> <br />Second, he doesn't spend nearly enough time on the coming oil crisis. Today oil is $65 a barrel. The biggest 'economic event of the twenty-first century' is going to be the change in our entire culture as oil goes to $165 then $265 a barrel. The whole economic situation of the world changes as transportation has to change. It costs about $3,000 to bring over one of those 40 foot containers from Asia. What if that goes to $30,000? What happens to the economics of Asian manufacturing?  <br /> <br />The dollar crisis is just one of the fun and exciting things we have to look forward to in the next few years.	2005-08-19

And his real problem was political generals, particularly Democrats who seemed to have both little capability as generals and who spent too much time as politicians. Burnside and McClellan come to mind.  <br /> <br />By far the most successful of the Democratic political generals was Black Jack Logan. A Congressman at the start of the war, he was one of those who went out with the Union army to watch them smash the Rebels at Bull Run/Manassas. Unlike the rest of the observing congressmen, he grabbed a rifle at the start of the battle and followed a Union unit into battle.  <br /> <br />Afterwards he entered the Union Army and by its end was a Major General in command of the Army of Tennessee. He was arguably the most competent of the volunteer generals, the political generals.  <br /> <br />After the war, he became a confidant of Grant and was supported by Grant for the presidency. Frederick Douglas was another supporter. All in all he was the odds on favorite to win the 1888 election but unexpectedly died.  <br /> <br />This is a very well written biography of one of the little known but most effective generals of the American Civil War.	2005-08-18

Your house was automatically connected to the city water mains when it was built and for a few dollars a month all the water you needed was supplied at the turn of a tap.  <br /> <br />My first home made water supply was out in the Louisiana swamps where average rainfall was more than fifty inches a year. It was a simple matter to build a catch system that caught the rain off the roof. But it was full of crud. A simple little device to catch the first of the rain in a bucket and when the bucket was full it pulled the outlet over to the big cistern and I had a water supply.  <br /> <br />Later I moved to the desert and water got a lot more tricky, with rainfall of eight inches a year the rules are different. The biggest projects were a series of about five thousand small enclosed catch basins which were burried in every little dry creek bed to catch what little water there was for birds to drink. Yes, it may sound silly, but that's what the people with the money wanted.  <br /> <br />As for this book, I only wish that I had known what contained in it when I started. Everything he says sounds so simple, makes so much sense that I wonder why I had to spend so much time making mistakes that taught me these same things.  <br /> <br />If you're going to go play in the water business, either for yourself, or even for a water department read this book first.	2005-08-18

Big enough that ESPN would buy the national organization and use their promotional power to make it even bigger. And with prizes in the $100,000 range, it isn't up to basketball or the other huge sports, but it certainly isn't just peanuts any more.  <br /> <br />Mike Iaconelli is still a young man but he's made it quickly (five years) into the really big time.  <br /> <br />This book is a sort of a cross between an autobiography and a basic primer on bass fishing. He talks about his life, but also gives a lot of detail on the research he does in advance of a tournament, the details which he has studied to determine where to go, what to do, what equipment to use, etc.  <br /> <br />To be sure this is pretty light reading. It won't take you very long to get through it. But it's very interesting to see how a pro approaches a subject, regardless of what that subject might be.	2005-08-18

The crime happens at a place with a geographical location, and the criminal must have come from some place (home, school, work) to get to the crime site, and he must have gone somewhere afterward. As early as the 1930, the 'Chicago School' began analyzing crime by sticking pins into maps on walls. By the 1970's sociologists began researching more deeply into 'mapping crime.'  <br /> <br />Beginning in the 1960's Graphical Information Systems began to be developed for various applications, and was given a big boost by space based imagery systems.  <br /> <br />In recent years the dramatic reduction in the price of computer processing power and the understanding of how crime mapping can be used to predict/prevent/solve crimes.  <br /> <br />In the last very few years many of the major technical/social problems in crime mapping have been either solved or great strides have been made in finding a solution.  <br /> <br />This book presents the state of the art in using GIS for Crime Mapping. It starts most chapters with tutorials devoted to some particular aspect, and concludes most chapters with a case study illustrating where these techniques are actually in use.  <br /> <br />This book is a general, overall introduction to GIS and Crime Mapping. It will be of use to departmental officials and to academics beginning to work in this area. It is well written, well researched and up to date (Published: July 22, 2005).	2005-08-18

By most standards of the business world it wouldn't make sense to be a teacher. The hours are long, the pay is relatively low. The respect and esteem that used to flow to teachers automatically is not seen quite so often. The bureaucracy seems overwhelming as more and more record keeping and reports are demanded.  <br /> <br />This book, conceived of and put together by Ms. Nieto asks the simple question in the title of the book to twenty-one teachers around the country. We parents can only hope that the views expressed by these teachers are representative of the majority of teachers that have our children under their care. And for the most part, the few teachers I know on a social basic, they are.  <br /> <br />The nice thing about this book is that the teachers have found ways to express their thoughts and feelings so nicely. It's a book you might want to present to your teacher friend on Christmas.	2005-08-18

It stopped at Sacramento, California. From there passengers and freight had to transfer to riverboats to get the rest of the way to San Francisco.  <br /> <br />The route between Sacramento and San Francisco was completed just after the Golden Spike was driven and ran south from Sacramento to Tracy and then west over Altamont Pass through Niles Canyon to the town of Niles. From there it tied into other railroads that provided continuous rail connects to San Francisco.  <br /> <br />In 1909 the Western Pacific built their route through the same canyon (but on the other side) into Niles. Through this canyon they ran the famous California Zephyr. (The California Zephyr still runs as Amtrak train No. 5/6, but not through Niles canyon. It just passed my house, westbound, four hours and three minutes late today.) <br /> <br />By 1984 the route through Niles canyon was abandoned.  This would have ended an era, but a preservationist group stepped in.  <br /> <br />With volunteer members doing all the work, track was put down on the old right of way, a magnificant collection of locomotives and rolling stock was moved there and the Niles Canyon Railway is one of the premier operating railroad museums in America.  <br /> <br />This magnificant book documents the Niles railroad history. It is profusely illustrated with pictures from the earliest days to the famous 'Train of Lights' (60,000 Christmas lights on twelve cars). I don't know how many photographs the book has, most pages seem to have two pictures, but they are an outstanding collection of vintage photographs to go with the new pictures of vintage equipment.  <br /> <br />If you're wondering just where Niles is, it was incorporated into the city of Fremont, northeast of San Jose. Read the book, then go spend a day (or a weekend) at the Niles Canyon Railway.	2005-08-18

The problem is that the waterfront there is almost entirely privately owned  with access restricted and with so much vegitation (trees) so that these views cannot be seen by the casual visitor.  <br /> <br />A surprising amount of these houses are the work of or were influenced by one architect, Frederick L. Savage. This magnificant book takes us not only back in time through historic photographs, but also through the trees and down the private access roads to see these houses and their settings.  <br /> <br />The style of these houses, most dating around 1900 have become almost a traditional United States style, although sometimes looking somewhat out of place when placed in a different kind of climate. These houses were designed to keep out the severe Maine winters, with small windows, strongly build roofs and the like.	2005-08-18

Regardless of which of these you pick, the information provided here is the most reasoned, the most thorough analysis of suicide terrorists I've seen. Perhaps there's more in the innards of the CIA or DIA or whatever, but as an independent outsider (I presume) I hope those folk are talking with Mr. Pape.  <br /> <br />Again, regardless of your view of this book, the critical question is the one he asks in the last chapter, 'can we find a lasting solution to suicide terrorism that does not compromise our core interest in maintaining access to one of the world's key oil-producing regions.'  <br /> <br />His answer is a qualified yes. The first thing that he mentions we should do is return to a policy of 'offshore balancing' in the Persian Gulf. That is, get our troops off shore and out of sight. Perhaps, but what happens if al-Qaeda appears to actually be taking over the government in Saudi Arabia and our troops go back in. Would moving them off shore have done any good? Do we pull them out completely, back say to the United States? What then happens to the access to oil?  <br /> <br />He says that a military victory is unlikely. But he does mention one case where decapitation of a terrorist organization worked. What will happen when we catch Osama bin Laden, or if he dies for some other reason? His financing of al-Qaeda seems a very important part of his leadership. Will it end? Does he have a successor?  <br /> <br />If you are doing any thinking about the situation in the middle east at all, this is a book you definitely need to read. The data he presents may not be perfect, his conclusion that occupation troops are the main cause of suicide terrorism may be open to question, but the data he has collected is something that you cannot ignore.	2005-08-18

She will then press the print button and you get billed for a thousand dollars or so.  <br /> <br />Kevin Finck is a San Francisco attorney practicing law in California. He decided to take his standard corporate form and put it out in the form of a book. In the book he will ask you a bunch of questions, taking the time to point out the alternatives (that a lawer probably doesn't do unless asked. You then take his standard corporation form (supplied on a CD) and fill in the answers. Files these with the appropriate offices and you have a corporation for only the filing fees the state charges. The forms used here have been used thousands of time to form California corporations. This is a new book (May 2005), it reflects the latest changes in California law. New corporations rarely have any excess money. Doing this work yourself will literally save the corporation hundreds of dollars that your organization probably doesn't have.  <br /> <br />Even if you prefer to use an attorney, going through this book, filling out the forms, and then simply asking him to review the forms will save you a lot of money. <br />	2005-08-18

No one will ever know the number of children killed, injured or made to suffer during World War II. The number of children simply vaporized in the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or the fire storms in Tokyo or Dresden will never be known. Tragic as these incidents are, the deliberate actions of the Nazi's stand out with a particular cruelty because they were deliberate, the active policy of the Government that should have been in charge of their welfare, not their death.  <br /> <br />In this monumental work, Ms. Nicholas discusses the lives of children in the Nazi world. The book is wide reaching covering the special 'orphanages' of the SS set up to generate more racially acceptable people, to the deliberate starvation and killing of children in concentration camps and other institutions, and the enlistment of Hitler Youth into special military divisions. One such division she reports entered the war with 10,000 'troops,' 600 made it back to Germany. The famous last movie of Hitler giving awards to the children outside his bunker as he shook with palsey shows his treatment of these children.  <br /> <br />Throughout the book the sadness, the futility, the inhumanity of this use of children fills every page. Then you look at a magazine and see the children in Africa, in the Middle East and elsewhere carrying their AK-47's. You would think that we would learn.	2005-08-17

It's far more than just the best plays, it's virtually every play.  <br /> <br />Of course it covers Broadway. But it also covers OFF Broadway, and OFF OFF Broadway. And it covers the major regional theaters around the country.  <br /> <br />Yes, it does have a section on what they consider to be the best plays of the season. But this section is only about a hundred pages and is really a description of these 'best' plays. I almost never agree with their selection of these as the really best plays, but I expect that their internal discussions must get pretty 'spirited.'  <br /> <br />Basically this is the book of what happened in theater from June 2003 to May 2004. Some of the things they cover: cast changes in ongoing Broadway plays, new plays published, long running plays, an In Memoriam, awards -- and the list could go on. It's what happened in theater.	2005-08-17

This is not an in depth text that will make you a patent attorney. This is also not a go get a patent yourself type book. This is an introduction to the process of getting a patent and what it is that you have after you get one.<br /><br />When you work with a patent attorney, the first thing that he has to do is explain to you what you need to do, how you need to document things, the procedure that you're going to have to go through and a whole lot more. This procedure is long and tedious. If the lawyer has to sit and explain it to you, he's going to charge you a bunch. This book does that job for a lot less money, and probably does a better job.<br /><br />There's one point that needs stressing. After you file for the patent, the application will be declined. This seems to be an unwritten rule of the Patent Office. If they reject it, you're supposed to refile if you think it's worth while. Sort of a test to see if you're serious.	2005-08-17

And he reports that his wife has refused to let him go again. <br /> <br />Then after that, he made another trip, this time in search of a Me-109. He found it, he bought it, and another miracle, they shipped it. Not only did they ship it, but they included a second Me-109. Now, with a million dollars, you can get a flying Messerschmitt.  <br /> <br />I'm passing this book along to a friend of mine who goes to Russia (not far from the P-63's) a couple of times a year (gold mining) to see if he can find a P-63 -- it would be almost worth it's weight in gold.  <br /> <br />He went to Russia in 1993. This was one of the first to begin to try to do business in Russia. I don't get the feeling that things have improved very much.	2005-08-17

Across the Hudson, even beyond New Jersey there is a culture that is alive. In many cases this culture is reflected in a theater that is far removed from Broadway, and ignored by the Broadway play wrights.  <br /> <br />Ms. Cohen-Cruz (although a New Yorker) has looked outside the New York boundries and studied both the history and the current state of local theater. She has looked at the South and at the larger regional theaters around the country and described the vitality that exists there. <br /> <br />This book is really good in its analysis of local theater. I think, however, she needs to do one more book.  <br /> <br />I live in the far west, and there is theater here as well. Many smaller communities have amateur productions that relate to the unique culture they have. Salt Lake City, for instance, has two. One, put on by the Mormon Church tells the story of the development of their religion and it's life in the Salt Lake valley. The other is a secular production that is rewritten each year to poke fun at the foibles of the church and local government.  <br /> <br />Here, further west than that I'm off this weekend to see a local play called Cathouse Afternoon. It does not reflect church values.	2005-08-17

She goes on to describe a set of idealized criteria that not coincidentally describe the USB interface.  <br /> <br />Actually I liked the first sentence in the previous edition better, it said: 'Computer hardware doesn't often get a chance to start fresh.'  <br /> <br />In any case the USB was a chance to start fresh. The PC was started by IBM as part of a crash project. They did a quick and dirty bus. It got expanded into the AT or ISA bus with the PC/AT God knows how many years ago. From this Intel developed the PCI bus.  <br /> <br />After several revisions (that never took off) Intel/Microsoft/Apple/Motorola and I don't know just how many others finally got together and started fresh with a design for a peripheral interface.  <br /> <br />The result was the USB. A point Ms. Axelson didn't mention was that the basic interface in the PC was cheap, really cheap. Motherboard manufacturers started including the connector on all their motherboards because the additional cost was something on the order of ten cents.  <br /> <br />For years we motherboard companies produced motherboards that went into computers that had USB and no one ever used them. Then all of a sudden, there were literally hundreds of millions of computers out there with USB and the peripheral manufacturers detected that a critical mass had been reached and behold, why connect using anything else.  <br /> <br />The USB interface at neither the basic signal sending hardware level nor the bit diddling software level is simple. But an inexpensive interface chip (because they're now produced in huge volume) and standard software in Windows and Linux and you can implement an interface. It's not the easiest thing in the world to do, but this book explains it in reasonably simple terms. If you're designing your new peripheral, here in one well done book is all that you need.  <br /> <br />Ms. Axelson starts with the basics about the USB and goes on to explaining how to select a chip (you'll want to look at the manufacturer's offerings as well, they change things a lot), implement it and program it. If it's your job to design the USB for a peripheral of some kind, this is the place to start, hands down, no question about it.	2005-08-17

I don't know why but has always embarrassed me to go to someone and ask for money. It took a lot of courage, kind of like asking that first girl for a date, to go try to collect money. <br /> <br />After a while I recognized that there was no reason for me to feel embarrassed. These people had contracted with me to do something, I had provided what I promised, and now these people were trying, deliberately or otherwise, to cheat me out of what they had previously agreed to pay.  <br /> <br />Ms. Dunn provides in this book a series of techniques -- first you start with a credit policy -- then you implement it. She talks about your legal rights both at a state and federal level -- yes, you have considerable rights. And she tells you how to read a credit report so that perhaps you don't need to go to a great deal of effort to collect by simply not doing business with these people.	2005-08-17

It was a battle between the British on one side and the combined navies of France and Spain on the other. But why, what else was going on, what made the British Royal Navy such a decisive victor, losing no ships but destroying 18 of the enemy.   <br /> <br />Beyond being a history of the battle itself, these are the kinds of questions addressed by Mr. Nicolson in this excellent new book. He views the battle as set in its time, when Napoleon had his army gathered on the coast of France and ordered the French Navy to clear the channel so that he could invade England. Viewed in this light, it might be that this should be called the first Battle of Britain.   <br /> <br />Further the ships of the Royal Navy were not in good shape to take on the battle. They had been at sea for a long time, their crews were tird, many were ill, and the ships themselves were in need of repair.   <br /> <br />Mr. Nicolson has researched the battle carefully, using previously unpublished diaries and reports. He also applies a sociological view to the British and gives some good explanations of why things happened the way they did.   <br /> <br />After the battle Napoleon, like Hitler was to do later turned his sights eastward. In December, barely six weeks later he fougnt and defeated the armies of Russia and Austria at Austerlitz.	2005-08-16

And the forward observers or FO's are what make it happen. The gunners can't see what they are shooting at. So up front, living in the dirt with infantry is the FO. <br /> <br />One of the big advantages the US forces had in World War II was artillery. Yes, the German 88 mm dual purpose gun got most of the attention, but it was an anti-aircraft gun also used in the anti-tank role. The real killer is a lot of guns firing explosive ammunition, especially with proximity fuses, sometimes called Variable Time fuses, that make it go off in the air above the troops.  <br /> <br />After the start it received in World War II, the Army learned to let the big guns do as much work as they could. The Chinese entered the Korean War eventually, and what they learned as an army was the effectiveness of good artillery well served.  <br /> <br />This book is in the form of individual stories of young men charged with the responsibility of making the big guns effective. Their stories describe a part of the war not often told.  <br /> <br />Korea was a time in between, as I guess all wars are. Now the FO has much more sophisticated equipment in the form of laser range finders, laser designaters that make him even more effective.  <br /> <br />Fascinating Book.	2005-08-16

This folume concentrates on the Vocal Works. To listen to great music and to enjoy it is one thing. Yet the professional student of classical music sees/hears/understands so much more than the rest of us.     In this book David Hurwitz, the founder and executive editor of [...], a daily classical music magazine, takes readers through Mozart's seven major operas, one part at a time explaining what he sees in each area. This provides an insite that most of us, particularily those of us living in remote areas, can never see.     I never imagines that you could see so much in this music.

The first part is on taking pictures. This doesn't talk about how to use your camera, that comes with the instructions supplied with the camera. Instead it talks about things like framing the image, setting the exposure, and things like that. If you're an experienced film photographer, this is probably repeat information. But if you're new to photography and this will give you a basic grounding.  <br /> <br />The second part talks about manipulating the images in your computer. Their software of choice is to use Paint Shop Pro. This is a good choice for the beginner because most books like this use Photoshop which costs a fortune and is quite complex.  <br /> <br />Finally it goes into printing. Obviously since this is the Shutterfly Guide, it talks a bit about using Shutterfly to do your printing. If you want to use them, this is an excellent book. If you want to do your own, there is still a good bit of information about printing the images yourself.  <br /> <br />All in all, a good introductory book on digital photos.	2005-08-16

Located close to there the dwellers have to go (work, school, shopping).  <br /> <br />6. Refurbish older buildings where possible.  <br /> <br />The thirty or so houses described in this book fit these criteria as best as possible. Some of these are in remote locations so fail in that criteria (unless you work at home and do not have children in school). But a surprising number of these dwellings are in cities: New York, Vienna, Stuttgart, Melbourne, San Antonio, Phoenix.  <br /> <br />The houses are striking in appearance, inexpensive to build, totally functional. As with other books of home plans, these houses serve as idea books for architects and potential owners to use in their new designs.	2005-08-16

Nanotechnology is not something that I would normally think of as being of interest to Dummies. I guess I'd best not give examples of subjects I'd think of as being suitable For Dummies.  <br /> <br />However, that misses the point. The For Dummies series has pioneered a writing style that enables the non-informed reader to get a much better understanding of complex subjects.  <br /> <br />Nanotechnology is a science that is only about twenty years old. I say 'about' twenty years because it really depends on just what you consider to be the start of the science.  <br /> <br />Nanotechnology deals with things that are nano in size, say around 1/5000 the size of a red blood cell, about 1/75,000 the diameter of a human hair. At that size, all kinds of strange and wonderful things begin to happen. The technology promises to offer significant improvements in all kinds of areas from energy, health, to computers.  <br /> <br />I can't really talk about the subject in this short review, it's too big, that's why it takes a whole book to cover.  <br /> <br />Conclusion: Written in the For Dummies style, this is a book on Nanotechnology that makes it understandable to the average person. I'd consider it mandatory reading for anyone thinking of going into chemistry or physics for a career. My prediction (and the authors) is that this is going to be the hot science subject of the next generation. If I knew a high school student interested in science....	2005-08-16

It describes the life of a wonderfully interesting lady who didn't stay just home and make babies.  <br /> <br />2. It gives a picture of Washington D.C. as it existed at the time of the Civil War. This picture is in two parts:  <br />a. the physical aspects, the filth, smell, and how life was lived, and  <br />b. the way Washington worked then (and now) power, money and sex.  <br /> <br />3. It is based on new information -- her diary, originally thought to have been written in code, but in fact just very poor penmanship.  <br /> <br />The story starts with a message sent to Gen. P.G.T Beauregard to give him an week's notice of when the Union Army would attack Manassas (Bull Run). He used this information to order reinforcements that enabled him to defeat the yankees. Through the course of the war Rose would be caught, imprisoned (without habeas corpus to even know the charges against her). She was exiled to the South, where she was sent by President Davis to France and England to try to get them to assist the South.  <br /> <br />This is a fascinating book. All the more so because it is true. Rose was a character born long before her time.	2005-08-16

I love Germany so much I'm really glad that there are two of them.' <br /> <br />Of course there are not two Germanys any more. And this book studies the question that since Germany is now the great power in Europe how will it use its power. Will it go back to its past aim and attempt to dominate Europe, Or has it renounced its imperial ambitions following the trauma of division during the Cold War?  <br /> <br />In an attempt to answer this question, Dr. Readman has looked at the situation in the Baltic states, caught between the countries of Russia and Germany, both of which are in a period of turbulent confusion.  <br /> <br />This book is based on numerous confidential interviews with key political actors and access to still classified material. Profusely referenced, this is a breadthrough book for those interested in the German question.	2005-08-16

And by middle classed I really mean rich when compared to a large number of people. I knew nothing of the bottom part of the world.  <br /> <br />My first experience at actually seeing the other side of the story was when I went to a meeting at a high school in New Jersey only a short distance from the mouth of the Holland Tunnel that lead to Manhattan and one of the richest parts of the world. Approaching the school, I was first struck by the razor wire topped chain link fences. And this was inside the building to seal off places such as the janitor's closet. How could anyone possibly get an education in such surroundings?  <br /> <br />Then in Africa I realized just how well off the school in New Jersey was. New Jersey at least had electricity and running water. And the walls of the school in New Jersey were brick and not a home to the birds and bugs of the thatch roof and woven walls.  <br /> <br />In Africa they have an excuse, the overall income of the country is so low that they are lucky to afford a teacher.  <br /> <br />I can only be very thankful that there are people like Sarah Sentilles around.

His comment, 'The central policy challenge remains as urgent as ever - how to get America to borrow less, import less, export more, save more, balance its budgets, repairs its national balance sheet, and lift the burden of unafforable public promises off the shoulders of today's young people,' reflects the view of a conservative financial manager.  <br /> <br />His suggestions of how to fix it would, if implemented, work.  <br /> <br />Are they likely to be implemented?  <br /> <br />No.  <br /> <br />There is one thing that every Senator and Congressman has, a wrinkled index finger from putting it in his mouth and holding it up to see what way the wind is blowing. And the wind isn't blowing this way.  <br /> <br />We just listened to the election last year. There was nothing substantial being said by either party. As Mr. Peterson says, both parties are ignoring this issue. Perhaps more than ignoring, they are denying that there is a problem. That's what they think the public wants to hear(including a bunch of bashing of the other party over non-issues).  <br /> <br />Mr. Petersen concentrates on financial issues. And everything from the graying of America to his discussions on the Course of Empire makes very good sense. I would like to hear his comments on some other issues, oil for instance.

Here's the image of a twelve year old boy standing up in a kayak, holding the paddle above his head using both hands and wearing a hundred watt smile as though he had just won the race, triumphed over the rapids or something grand.  <br /> <br />Instead we learn that the child is on a camping trip with a pedophile and that the evenings are spent having sex.  <br /> <br />This book treats the sexual escapades almost as games. He tells of this time almost like the stories of a secret agent. Clandestine meetings where he is doing something that the rest of the world just doesn't know about. Only later does he begin to realize the sickness and the violation.  <br /> <br />After three years, at the age of fifteen, Marty realizes the mess he is in and begins the long struggle to recovery. He realizes that he is homosexual, but wonders if this is because of his sexual introduction or is it the reverse.  <br /> <br />Transferring to a public highschool and getting out of the oppressive all-male Catholic he is able to discover drama and begins to develop a career on stage.  <br /> <br />This book tells a story of abuse that should not happen in a fair world.

It is a military history, written from the standpoint of a senior military officer who is able to see and understand what the military of both sides were doing.  <br /> <br />Second, this book goes beyond the military history of the two countries to explain the internal workings, the culture, the commercial activities of the two countries. He is then able to relate these points to the overall battle.  <br /> <br />Third, the reason to study history is to be able to relate what happened to what is happening now. And he is able to relate these wars from so long ago to the conflict between the Soviet Union and the West.  <br /> <br />Fourth, at the beginning of wars, the finding of competant generals has been a problem. This was true in the Punic wars. This was certainly true in the American Civil War (witness the number of generals Lincoln put in charge of the Army of the Potomac). And it was true at the start of World War II on the part of both the British and the Americans. In the short wars of the future, this cannot be allowed to happen. <br /> <br />Splendid history with direct applicability to modern times.	2005-08-15

It was, of course, a time of prohibition and speakeasies.  <br /> <br />It was also a time when a handfull of women writers were beginning to come out from the shadow of literature where women had to use male names to get published. This book gives the story of four extraordinary writers: Dorthy Parker, Zelda Fitzgerald, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and Edna Ferber. It's not exactly a biography of these four women, more of a tone piece with stories of incidents in their lives.  <br /> <br />The times allowed these women to do things they couldn't have done before. Yet at the same time it extracted quite a price. This period and these women set the stage for the depression that followed and Rosie the Riveter that came later. For their independence, they paid a high price in their own personal lives.	2005-08-15

I always thought it would take too much time to drive that far just to see another indian thing. In a way I was right, because when I finally went there it took all the rest of that day and part of the next to drag myself away.  <br /> <br />This book goes a long ways in explaining Chaco. Yet at the same time, I find that the more I learn the more pronounced become the questions. Who indeed were these people? Why did they build such big houses? And why so many? It seems that the times in which they lived were as arid as now, how did that many people live there? And what was Chaco? And why locate at Chaco canyon rather than any others? The houses and the 'observatory' that marks the solstice have a sun orientation but why? ==Anyway those are some of the unanswered questions. What this book does do is describe Chaco Canyon in detail and give the best current answers to a lot of the common questions.  <br /> <br />If you are not familiar with Chaco Canyon, it is a very remote canyon in New Mexico that has the remains of several huge apartment house like buildings. They were built by the Ancestral Puebloan Indians. To me it ranks as one of the big four archeological sites in the Four Corners area. The others being the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings in Colorado, Canyon de Chelly (Pronounced Canyon de Shay) in Arizona, and Hovenweep in SE Utah.	2005-08-15

The very openness of the web on a worldwide basis makes it very difficult to find the bad guys. This is especially true when countries like China, Nigeria and numerous 'stans from the old Soviet Union don't seem to care.  <br /> <br />The result is that it is left up to the individual to build his own fences, hire his own guards. And use software that is written without the holes that allow the bad guys to come in.  <br /> <br />This book started with the Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Security Division. The director asked John Viega to define the most common well-understood programming mistakes that lead to break ins. The result is this book. The authors say that the rules they followed in writing this book were quite simple:  <br /> <br />Keep it Simple -- no war stories, no funny anecdotes just the facts.  <br /> <br />Keep it short -- the facts and nothing else.  <br /> <br />Cross Platform -- because the Internet runs on everything.  <br /> <br />Cross Language -- because many languages on many platforms are used on the web.  <br /> <br />This book is aimed at software developers and outlines the most common and destructive coding sins and how to eradicate them from code before customers use the software.	2005-08-14

Then I turned to the first page of the introduction and pictured was the country home of the Eleventh Duke of Marlborough in 1722. His home, called Blenheim Palace, was not moden, definitely not small and incidentally was the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill. Next to it though was the tiny cabin used by Henry David Thoreau at Walden Pond.  <br /> <br />The book is organized into four chapters with houses separated by style. The styles he features are:  <br /> <br />Organic -- homes made to fit in with the surroundings. This includes both a sensitivity to the site and landscape but also to building materials: stone, timber, adobe.  <br /> <br />Verhacular -- Powerful and beautifyl homes that fuse vernacular references and ideas with contemporary demands for open-plan living and flexible spaces.  <br /> <br />New Modern --Where new materials and technology bring in innovation with engineering challenges but still preserve a respect for their rural surroundings.  <br /> <br />Experimental -- Where anything goes. Well away from the restrictive covenents, building codes and other pressures of society, these are homes that stretch the limits of thematic, structural and let the country be one of the great laboratories of architectural change.  <br /> <br />This book provide great photography and descriptions with a selection of houses from around the world.	2005-08-14

This book is a collection of stores that feature the best of these presentations including apparel and accessories, home boods, specialty items, food and restaurants, the latest Chiristmas windows in New York and more.  <br /> <br />The editors have literally travelled the globe looking for stores to highlight. They features stores from Paris to New York, Miami, smaller cities like Lakewood, Colorado, and several stores in Tokyo.  <br /> <br />As with other architectural picture books, this book is intended to provide inspiration for you to design your own merchandizing. It's a beautiful book, and only one idea that helps you sell more will easily cover the cost.	2005-08-14

To be sure you could select the film you wanted to use to highlight blues or reds or whatever, and when printing the image you had some control over the printing process. With the advent of desktop publishing this has changed. Color management is in your hands.  <br /> <br />This is a book that concentrates on color. It uses Adobe Photoshop Creative Suite 2 as the standard software package for illustrating what can be done. And there is one chapter on using Quark Express.  <br /> <br />The book starts with the simple question -- why doesn't the image coming from your printer match what you see on the screen. By the end of the book you'll not only know why, but you'll know how to fix it.  <br /> <br />As you can guess from the title, this book concentrates its discussion on Windows XP platforms. It's a welcome addition to the literature of handling color	2005-08-14

The most famous, of course is the big elaborate Broadway production. This features (usually) big name writers, producers, elaborate costumes and scenery, 25 piece orchestras, a big operating budget and correspondingly high priced tickets ($100 a seat is not uncommon).  <br /> <br />The off-Broadway venue typically has smaller plays, a cast of a half dozen or so, a couple of musicians, and a ticket price that more of us can afford. These plays are often seen endlessly in the smaller theaters around the country.  <br /> <br />There's a third type of play, that put together in the smaller communities that put together plays locally. They usually feature loconomic, political and social realities -- 'People we know, telling our story.'  <br /> <br />This book contains seven plays put together by some of the better known ensemble companies from around the US. They have not been previously piblished. This book illustrates the creativity of the local theater in various parts of the US, outside of New York City.  <br /> <br />And yes, local theater is alive and doing well.	2005-08-14

She will then press the print button and you get billed for a thousand dollars or so.  <br /> <br />Anthony Mancuso is a corporations corporations attorney licensed to practice law in California. He decided to take his standard corporate form and put it out in the form of a book. In the book he will ask you a bunch of questions, taking the time to point out the alternatives (that a lawer probably doesn't do unless asked. You then take his standard corporation form (supplied on a CD) and fill in the answers. Files these with the appropriate offices and you have a corporation for only the filing fees the state charges.  <br /> <br />The forms used here have been used thousands of time to form California corporations. This is the eleventh edition of this book, it reflects the latest changes in California law. Non-profits never have any money. Doing this work yourself will literally save the corporation hundreds of dollars that your organization probably doesn't have.	2005-08-13

Then I thought of the floating bridges that the folk at the Department of Transportation seem to like. I would have been disappointed if these bridges hadn't been included in this book. But they were, along with a bunch of other bridges that have failed also. One failed when a herd of sheep crossed it. Another when fireworks set it on fire. Earthquakes and the eruption of Mt. St. Helens caused more to fail. Then there was the one where a forty ton logging truck attempted to cross a bridge designed for a five ton load.  <br /> <br />But enough about failed bridges. This is really a book on the hundreds of other bridges around the State of Washington. Some of these are magnificant structures. A lot are surprisingly different, one bridge for instance that was bought war surplus. And I didn't realize that there were still three wooden covered bridges in the state.  <br /> <br />This is mostly a picture book, with just enough technical description as to the types of bridges to make it even more interesting. A lot of these bridges would make a good weekend excursion trip to go see. If you're interested in this sort of thing, this is a most interesting book. It's one that I intend to take along on vacations to tell us a bit about where we are going.	2005-08-13

Some of them offering quite unusual house designs. But nothing I've ever seen compares with the designs in this book. ==I've seen houses built on poles because they are located in a flood plain. Of course the Swiss Family Robinson and the Ewoks of StarWars fame lived in tree houses. I had one as a kid, and when my daughter came along, she had one (she could pull up the ladder and keep her brother out).  <br /> <br />In this book however professional architects from all over Europe, Tasmania, and the U.S have been used to design houses that live up in trees. The houses are mostly not the entire living structure but are offices, retreats, studios, and some of the most exciting entertainment areas imaginable. The results are unbelievably striking.  <br /> <br />The integration of the advanced design with the natural look of the trees gives a feeling of working together that I wouldn't have expected. This is true if the tree house is ultra modern, traditional, or some that I guess I'd just call unconventional. A surprising book.	2005-08-13

I've always thought of Salmon as something you could only cook in one or two ways. This book came as a big surprise as it includes 120 or more recipies showing salmon being cooked in just about every imaginable fashion. Bill Jones is the editor of the book. An accomplished chef in his own right, trained in France and England he has since specialized in the regional foods of the North West. <br /> <br />In this book he has worked with many of the chef/authors who have published books with Whitecap publishers. They have each contributed salmon recipies from their own kitchens. The recipies are broken down by the course of the meal, as follows:  <br /> <br />Marinades & Curing  <br />Stocks, Soups & Chowders  <br />Canapes & Snacks  <br />Appetizers  <br />Eggs & Pastry  <br />Salads  <br />Barbecue  <br />Baked & Broiled  <br />Poached & Steamed  <br />Saute & Stirfry.  <br /> <br />I can't think of any other part of a meal. The only problem I have with the book is that I'm having a dinner party tonight. I think Barbecued salmon might be a very good thing to have. But there are eight different barbecue recipies. Which one should I try first?	2005-08-13

It's the thing that tells your customers what you do and gives them the detailed information that they need to make a decision.  <br /> <br />Catalogs began with the mail order industry where the technology grew to measure sales return per square inch of paper. Over time, the professionals learned what worked and what didn't. Then when everything was working pretty well, the Internet came along and changed all the rules. All of a sudden space was endless, no more big checks to the printers. Communications was essentially free, no more big checks to the post office. The rules changed because the option to thumb through the catalog was no longer there. Instead sophisticated search and discover techniques needed to be worked out.  <br /> <br />Jack Schmid has been in the catalog business, both print and electronic for many years. In this book he passes along dozens, if not hundreds of points. The book covers quite a lot of ground. Much of the book is on the functions that have to be performed whether the catalog is printed, electronic or both. This includs things like product selection, fullfillment, customer service and finance. There is a goodly amount of material on the printed version of the catalog, as these are still required by most companies. There are several points interspersed throughout the book and finally chapters on things like database marketing, the Internet, and more.  <br /> <br />This is one of the most all inclusive books available on catalog marketing and includes just about everything there is to know.	2005-08-13

Unlike many publishers, they have not concentrated on the giant mansions that few of us can afford. This book is a compilation of houses selected from about ten years of hous books. It features fifty homes, perhaps ten percent of the homes featured in all of their books, that have been selected by a panel of distinguished residential architects using a number of criteria based on both attractive design and things like livability.  <br /> <br />I'm thinking of building a new house. I live alone, kids are gone, I don't like house cleaning so want a small easy maintenance house. That's not to say that some distinctive architecture would hurt. There are some houses here that really have me thinking. One in Kansas was built to a $50,000 budget using a lot of salvaged commercial building pieces such as trusses.  <br /> <br />Then at the end of the book, three of the architects who helped select the 50 houses have short essays on residential artechitecture. This is a splendid coffee table book, but beyond that, if you've any thought of building, this is a marvelous book.	2005-08-12

She covers virtually every culture in almost every time with an amazing selection of photographs. She combines this with interviews, stories and descriptions of puppeteers. She describes all of the wide variety of puppet shows brought about by the advent of television, some of which are still on the air.  <br /> <br />Part of her discussion is on the way that puppets can be used to show/discuss things that wouldn't be allowed in other ways. Politics, for instance is different when a puppet is making the remarks about your leader. And of course sex has long been a staple of puppet shows. She has a picture of the romantically challenged Miss Piggy delivering an illustrated lecture on ideal frog physique.  <br /> <br />If puppets are your thing, you'll find nothing better than this book.	2005-08-11

Ms. McEvoy has pioneered using glued to add decorative pieces, to dress up virtually everything around her house. Sometimes her decoration has gotten a bit strange, I don't think I'd want the seashell decorated fireplace in my house. In a beach house, it might go well. Some of her other pieces show features that I like much better. Her way of adding a bit of trim to a very plain lampshade suits my likes much better.  <br /> <br />In this regard we're just getting into a sense of style. It isn't expected that we'd like each others style. What is expected is that she would use a wide variety of items in this book to show what she is capable of doing with the glue gun. And on this she comes over very well.  <br /> <br />I also liked her comments on selecting the glue gun. The first one I bought was a super cheap one and it barely worked at all, I eventually threw it away. Following her recommendation I'm going to go look for an Aleen's Ultimate. The different tips make a lot of sense.	2005-08-11

Having visited there many times, I think that from the ground I saw too little. I especially saw too little of the beauty and too much of the trash, dirt, and wear. And I don't know when the pictures were taken, but I never saw the freeways look so empty.  <br /> <br />Ms. Evans is a well known landscape photographer. I'd think of these pictures more as a cityscape, but she has an amazing eye to to point the camera exactly in the right place for maximum impact.  <br /> <br />In addition to the downtown metro area, she has also been able to find scenes of wilderness, of parks, of residential area, even of the U-505 submarine at the Museum of Science and Industry and in all seasons of the year. This book is obviously the work of a lot of time, and the pictures are dated in 2003 and 2004. A marvelous book that shows Chicago in it's most favorable light.	2005-08-11

This magnificant book is the companion book to go with the Tutankhamun exhibition that is currently touring the United States. It features the magnificant photography for which National Geographic is famous complete with a narative written by Zahi Hawass, the secretary general of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities and director of the Giza and Saqqara Pyramids. In the descriptions, he talks about the life of the boy king, the state of Egypt at the time, the religion and much more. Each piece of the exhibit is discussed as to what it is, what significance it has, and where it was found.  <br /> <br />Perhaps most striking is the reconstructed image of Tutankhamun. It was made by a special CT scanner that obtained images from inside the mummy's wrappings without damaging them. This created the first three-dimensional picture of Tutankhamun.  <br /> <br />The exhibit will show in LA, June 16 to November 15, 2005, Ft.

And I suspect that at 23% the rate is a little bit low. If you're going to put on a National Sales Tax, I'd like to see it cover all the other hidden taxes as well. I believe the tax on gasoline is a bit over 50 cents a gallon. Property taxes, state sales taxes, excise takes on things like tires, and the disposal fee on tires. There are literally hundreds of taxes that I think we would be better off without, and for the same reasons getting rid of the income tax is good.  <br /> <br />The politicians you might be able to convince, all you have to do is get them to believe that their change of getting re-elected is better. It sounds like progress is being made. The criminals are smart enough to never vote for this, but there aren't too many of them. The liberals will never be convinced that if you give them a dollar and a half for every dollar they get now, and then take 25 or 30 cents away in the sales tax that they will have more money.  <br /> <br />Let's hope. It makes so much sense.	2005-08-10

It begins with a volcanic eruption that causes a collapse of the ground around a burial site. Now exposed is the small frozen mummy of an Inca girl, presumably (but not certainly) a deliberate sacrifice.  <br /> <br />The discovery of this mummy, now called the Ice Maiden began a series of architectural discoveries in the region that have greatly expanded our knowledge of the Incas and their way of life.  <br /> <br />This book takes the form of a personal travelogue written by one of the National Geographic's Explorers-in-Residence. It is a blend of architecture, mountaineering, and exploration in an area still not frequented by many. It is at once a personal story and a report on a momentous finding.  <br /> <br />The photographs in the center of the book are so stunning, that my one regret is that this section isn't twice or three times as long as it is.	2005-08-10

The articles are written my masters of their respective field and together they bring modern thinking on every aspect of such invasions into view. <br /> <br />Early in the project it was suggested to bring the contributors together for a workshop.

The general tone of the book is a lot like the first one, with an approach of this is what I wanted to do, and this is how I did it.  <br /> <br />The casual sub-title of this book is 'Learning to Play with Others.' The overall story is how to use After Effects with various kinds of input data, and how to get the resulting animation out to what the customer can actually use.  <br /> <br />It is highly recommended that you first read and become master of the techniques described in Volume 1. Then this book itself is Highly Recommended.	2005-08-10

New technologies such as the Internet are creating both opportunities and confusion. Combine this with broader context of educational needs, the explosion in very expensive scholarly periodicals, the ever present budgetary problems, and the profusion of remote campuses. All of these are combining to force change upon the library system.  <br /> <br />This book provides both an analysis of the changes that are occurring, but also the ways libraries are facing these changes. The book is suitable for use as a text in library and information science courses as well as an introduction for new professionals and academic administrators.	2005-08-09

There were people with views from one extreme to the other. While we focus on the 'big names' in history, the war was fought by individuals who came to join the Continental Army. We tend to ignore the impact of the slave holding states that forced words into the Declaration of Independence that were to cause a massive war 'four score and seven' years later.  <br /> <br />Mr. Nash presents, not a revisionists history, but a view more along the lines of 'the inside scoop.' There is little here that is truly new, but it is put together in a very interesting manner that makes the history of the American Revolution more understandable, more lifelike. These were real people struggling to make things happen, some suceeded, some didn't, just like the rest of life.	2005-08-09

Numerous publications led the world of science into a new and better understanding of our world.  <br /> <br />The most famous today was of course Einstein. His seminal work led to the establishment of the Standard Model of the Universe. It was published in 1905. It also led to the Atomic Bomb which probably saved the lives of a million servicement, including two of my uncles. (Although I'm writing this on the anniversary of the Nagasaki bomb, and there is certainly a different view than mine being expressed in Japan.)  <br /> <br />Fritz Haber published seventeen different papers during 1904 and 1905. He was basically defining the science that we now know as Physical Chemistry. The Haber-Bosch process for taking nitrogen out of the air and making it into fertilizer is repsonsible for the food supplies that we have in the world today. While there may be starvation, without Haber there would be much, much more.  <br /> <br />The story of Fritz Haber is the story of a giant among scientists. This book tells his story. It tells it however with a negative tone that seems common today among left wing writers.  <br /> <br />\\"Had German politics taken a different turn, Fritz Haber might be considered a hero, and statues of him might stand in prominent places,\\" Charles writes. \\"Instead, Haber became a tragic figure, trapped within the moral blinders of his time, unable to recognize the direction of history....Haber could not forsee the ultimate consequences of the path he chose; perhaps it isn't fair to expect that he should have. But those consequences - the fateful prolongation of a senseless war, the invention of new methods of dealing out death - stand as a warning to all who follow.\\"  <br /> <br />Einstein left Germany, came to the US, and wrote the letter to Roosevelt about building the bomb. Haber remained a German patriot and did the best he could for his country. Perhaps Haber should have come here, would Charles think better of him? But he couldn't predict the future. Who could have possibly have predicted the Nazi's?  <br /> <br />I still rank the book quite high, a biography of Haber is long overdue, this one is well researched and well written. I just think that asking a scientist to predict social happenings and condemning him when he is wrong is asking a bit much. Even our philosophers and politicians who should be the best at this sort of thing don't do very well.	2005-08-09

Many companies do not want to invest, perhaps they cannot invest in their own IT department to understand and develop exactly what they need.  <br />Microsoft understands this very well. Consequently many of their products are designed so that someone else can take their products and make it function as the final customer needs.  <br /> <br />A perfect example is a database. A company wants to keep track of something. A database is the ideal way to do this. But does anyone at that company understand enough about database design to implement the database, design the forms and reports to make it easy enough for the clerks in the company to use, and then train the clerks?  <br /> <br />The result is Microsoft's partnering philosophy. If you will set up your company to take Microsofts basic software and make it work as the final customer wants, then Microsoft wants to work with you, will supply you with support and leads, give you all kinds of advantages.  <br /> <br />The alternative in the IT industry is to do your own thing, perhaps in competition with Microsoft. History tends to say that this isn't all that wise.  <br /> <br />The authors fo this book are experts in working with Microsoft. In this book they give you the whole scoop, including the bad points (Suppose the customer really should use Linux!).	2005-08-09

The United States Navy was ill prepared to enforce such a blockade. Officially the U.S. Navy consisted of ninety vessels. Only forty-two of these were in commission, the rest were in moth balls, or as it was called then 'in ordinary,' or they were on foreign station, or patrolling the Gulf coast. Nor were the ships that were available suited for blockade use. The Navy primarily had ships designed for deep water operations, not the shallow coastal areas typical of the southern coast.  <br /> <br />As the title says, success was expected. The blockade of course lasted throughout the war. By the end the Navy was not only prepared, but was indeed able to effectively blockade these ports.  <br /> <br />The particular area covered by the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron covered from Cape Fear to Cape Canaveral. This book joins the authors previous bookon the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and presumably there is at least one more book to come in the series.	2005-08-09

A flat tax makes so much sense that you have to wonder why all the politicians are so blind that they don't pass it tomorrow.  <br /> <br />Answer: Congress works on the basic idea that they want a complex tax system. Every twenty or so years congress passes a new simplified tax system to reduce the Internal Revenue Code from several big thick books down to one or two. They they spend each year of the next twenty years writing additional loop holes to give some break to a favored contributor.  <br /> <br />In this book Mr. Forbes makes a good concise argument for the flat tax. It will be argued by all kinds of people that this is a plan to benefit only the rich, that corporations will make ever more money, that it's only to get the stock market up, or whatever.  <br /> <br />Will it happen? There's some reason to think that the world is moving that direction. The current strength of the Republicans might make it happen, while the basic 'soak the rich' attitude of the Democrats would make it impossible for them to pass. There is some indication that people are tired of the 'simplification' dance that Congress does without changing anything.  <br /> <br />The new information coming from the ex-Soviet states adds some interesting points to Mr. Forbes views.	2005-08-09

This is material that is more advanced than what I was taught in college. Now this material is produced in a form suitable for a young audience.  <br /> <br />The wording, the explanations, the selection of what to present in this small book is excellent. It presents todays standard model of cosmology, that is, the most recent theories of how the universe was formed from the big bang theory itself to the people who helped to develop the theories.  <br /> <br />I do not know the background of the author, but I have rarely seen such simple and clear explanations of such a complex subject.

Following a course that a lot of us have had to take she was lonely, bored, and generally unhappy. Eventually she remembered how much she had enjoyed playing basketball and turned to playing  as a way to pass the time, meet people, develop a life.  <br /> <br />Basketball was her thing, never with a thought of turning pro or anything like that (she admits to not being very good), but just finding a place to be.  <br /> <br />That sounds kind of dull, but it's a story of finding oneself, of growing up. And through basketball she is able to discover things about the issues of race, class, gender, religion, sexual politics and love.  <br /> <br />Hers was a trip that I had to take long before she was born. I can only wish that I'd had the literary skill to record it as well as she does. This is a delightful book.	2005-08-08

It is divided into three sections, of which I found the first to be the most interestiing. This part, simply titled Islam is about 120 pages and uses quotes from the Qur'an to illustrate his contention that Islam is a very militant war-like religion.     Being a skeptic, and not very familiar with the Qur'an I went to my favorite on line card catalog of free books on the web - [...]and went looking for a copy of the Qur'an to see if he was at least quoting it correctly. I didn't check every reference, but the ones I did check he was quoting absolutely correctly. Specifically he used the Picthal translation.     This part of the book is pretty scary. While he has deliberately inflamatory sections of the Qur'an to discuss, it seems that a bunch of the radical Islamic folk have picked the same sections to justify their actions. This doesn't bode well for the future.     The second section of the book is on the Crusades. He says that the Crusades are being used as justification for some of the more radical elements. I suspect that this is true. He says that the politically correct people in the US are picking up on this and using it to blame us for the whole thing. They forget that the forces of Islam took over Spain, sacked Rome, etc. etc. Yes, a thousand years ago there was a lot of fighting. But there is little we can do about that today. If the extremists want to justify their actions based on events from that long ago, there is nothing we can do about it.     The last section in the book, only about fifty pages long is on today's Jihad. All I can say is that it's damn scary.	2005-08-08

With that much money involved, it is a very long way from the game the kids are playing int he park across the street. Yet we seem to want to put the trappings of a sport on the whole thing.  <br /> <br />Baseball's current set of problems began with the strike in 1994 which wiped out about half the season. What could be done to get the fans back into the parks, buying tickets? The answers to jazz up the game, do things to make it faster, do things to make it more exciting. Don't pay too much attention to anything else.  <br /> <br />The result it, we have a scandal. ==Duh! What did you guys expect? ==What rock star doesn't have a reputation of having done drugs? The movie stars have face lifts and boob jobs. The baseball players found a way to improve their chances of being superstars in the form of bottles of pills.  <br /> <br />If MLB is a game, with these guys setting examples for youth and all that, it's one thing. If MLB is a business with these guys basically being entertainers it's quite another.  <br /> <br />Mr. Bryant tells the story of MLB since 1994, the title of the book calls it a game. I'm not quite sure if he really sees it that way. He certainly understands both sides.	2005-08-08

The development of ULTRA and MAGIC gave the Allied Admirals a significant advantage in the battles of the Atlantic and of course at Midway. This was really the start of intelligence moving from a dead end career to a position of some prominence in the Navy world.<br /><br />This book gives a bit about the history of operational intelligence during World War II but is mostly about the development of Naval operational intelligence after the end of the war.<br /><br />Our intelligence agencies took a hit in the aftermath of 9/11. Perhaps there was still too much orientation to the Cold War. Perhaps there was no orientation at all, just continuing business as usual. This book concludes with a chapter called Transition, Refocus, and the Future. This covers the time vrom the Goldwater-Nichols Bill which restructured the U.S. military command structure into a series of worldwide joint-service regional and functional commands. In the jargon of the services, many functions like OPINTEL went \\"Purple,\\" that is no more concentration on the White uniforms of the Navy, the Blue of the Air Force, or the Green of the Army. The change isn't complete, but experience has shown that an understanding of the past and the capabilities that were built up are the base upon which the organization of the future is built.<br /><br />The book is dedicated to the eighe Naval Intelligence shipmates who died in the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.	2005-08-08

To me this books title and sub-title are inconflict.  <br /> <br />The title, 'America's Right Turn' implies to me that the overall attitudes of the country have taken a gigantic turn to more conservative rule.  <br /> <br />The sub-title, 'How conservatives used new and alternative media to take power,' implies to me that the right wing has been able to put together a way to convince the populace in the last couple of elections to put them in office.  <br /> <br />Yes, they did a very good job. But the left wing knows how to do this also. If you look at the last election, it was a very close election. And it was this close with fairly weak Democratic candidates. The United States does not tend to elect senators, we elect people with line management experience -- governors mostly: Bush, Clinton, Carter, Reagan. And Edwards came out as particularly weak, an ambulance chaser with little experience in anything else.  <br /> <br />Viguerie & Franke give an excellent report on the trends in media and advertising. But remember that the liberal media they decry is constantly falling in impact. New channels have to be developed, and the right doesn't have an iron clad hold on the new.  <br /> <br />The country isn't as 'right' as these authors believe - people want the right to have abortions, and 'Creative Science' is downright silly. But nor is the country as left as the Democrats would have you believe - people don't want gun control or 'soft on crime' any more than the right wing message.  <br /> <br />This is a book to read for history, and for technique. Let's wait until the next election to see if the right turn is permanent.	2005-08-07

To do this in a profitable manner, you need two sets of skills.  <br /> <br />The first is the one you know about. You've got to find customers, you've got to do the job they want done and you've go to make them happy. This is probably the job you've trained yourself to do through experience, through training, and through the basic aptitude that you had to get into that business in the first place.  <br /> <br />The second job is harder. You've got to realize that you are a business manager. You need accounting (to keep your business partner the IRS happy). You need to develop a busines plan, budgeting, etc. You need to know how to prepare and send out bills and how to handle the money when it comes in. And the most critical of all, telling the customer what your effort is going to cost him.  <br /> <br />In this book Mr. Williams gives an excellent introduction on how to do these critical things. He also includes enough war stories from his past to give you the understanding of how he learned these things.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed his page one story of starting his own company: sold his car so as to eliminate the payments, crammed his office into his bedroom, paid off all credit cards, in general reduced his expenses to a minimum. When I started I did almost exactly the same: I had a very tiny kind of dumpy house in not too good a neighborhood - but no payments. I had an ancient vehicle - but no payments. Like with him, I was profitable the first month, but you had best not bet on it.  <br /> <br />Mr. Williams has been there, done that, walked the walk. His book makes excellent sense.	2005-08-07

Imagine what it must have taken to stand in your place in the phalanx and chop away with your sword or pike at another batch of soldiers just in front of you. You had to stand there while the men on either side of you, behind you, and if you weren't the front rank the men in front of you were hacked to pieces. And when the ones in front fell, you had to move up and take their place.   <br /> <br />And the Greeks developed a training regimen that produced young men that could take their place in the phalanx.   <br /> <br />Coming forward a couple of thousand years and the same concepts in training produced people that could step out of the woods on a mile long treck up hill with the rest of Picketts division. Or could get up out of the trenches and walk into the machine gun and artillery fire between the trenches. How could you do this other than stoicly?   <br /> <br />The problems come when the soldiers return from the battle, when they are in control of captured enemy soldiers, and in many other areas.  Ms. Sherman does a great job of understanding the military mind, and of some suggestions as to what may need to be changed as the world changes. Highly recommended!	2005-08-07

They vary from simple, use Front Page type books, to books on the back end process like those on .asp or php. There aren't many books that take a step back and ask questions like 'what is it that you are trying to do with this web site,' 'how easy is it for the visitor to find what he wants,' 'how does the web help fulfill the overall business mission of the organization.'  <br /> <br />This is not a teckie book. It doesn't tell you how to do HTML, instead it is on the things you need to think about first before you start to cut code, or have someone else do the site. One of the big mistakes is who to pick to design the web site. An artist tends to make it pretty. A programmer makes it clean looking. A marketeer wants to sell things. Management has to decide the goals of the site. And management often isn't prepared to do that because of a lack of knowledge about what is possible. This book attempts to bring management up to the level of specifying a web site.	2005-08-07

The dot-com burst of a few years back has created the impression that on-line marketing died with it. Yet, just a few days before Christmas last year Amazon reported that they had had their bussiest day ever, averaging 38 orders per second for twenty four hours. Furthermore, their most popular item was the Apple i-pod, a fairly expensive item.  <br /> <br />The dot-com craze was just that, like tulip mania and many others, it was basically trying to be the one selling to the last fool in line. While it was happening, others were learning about selling on line. It was slow going, you had to ignore the hype, you had to put together real companies rather than one just polished up for the stock market.  <br /> <br />In this book Mr. Meyerson has collected what appear to be 24 specially written chapters by 24 of the most successful internet marketers in the world. While there are no real secrets to internet marketing, the old marketing rules have to be slightly transformed to fit the new communications medium.  <br /> <br />This is not a tutorial on how to do it as much as here is what we've tried that worked.

Then again, I guess it's always changing. I had dinner last night with a young man that seemed a lot like Hawk Hyde must have been 40 years ago. Forehead white as can be, the rest of his face well tanned. Not a dimestore cowboy. He even made the same comments about rodeos, he competes in the local ranch hand rodeos, but the big money circuit is not for working ranch hands.  <br /> <br />I guess this is more of a memoir. Tales told by a raconteur of no small skill. These are stories of the west from the thirties to the years after the war, and a bit on the times since. The stories improve over real life. Real life is endlessly riding a horse along a fence line in the cold, the rain, the hot, hour after endless hour. This is the good moments of the west.	2005-08-06

Bob Dole, obvious of course because of the injury to his hand, Jack Kennedy, Nixon, and Eisenhower, and probably many more.  <br /> <br />I had not known that Jim Wright, long time representative from Texas and eventually Speaker of the House had served combat tour with the Army Air Force. This story wasn't written until some fifty eight years after the fact. And it's written as an answer to his grandchrildren's 'What Did You Do in the War, Grandpa,' even if they hadn't asked the question.  <br /> <br />His is a fairly standard tale of fairly standard people engaged in something so big that from the lower levels of the Army they could only glimpse a tiny bit. As he says, they weren't the Greatest Generation, not extraordinary people, just fairly malleable yound folks, products of our times and of our parents guidance. Hitler thought these young men decadent, indolent and soft. They weren't that either.  <br /> <br />There are few surprises to the story. Young man, Pearl Harbor, hasty marriage, and a long B-24 flight to the war in the South Pacific. But then there is:  <br /> <br />Lt. Hal Grace, bombardier, shot down, beheaded by the Japanese.  <br />Lt. David Lippencott, pilot, show down, beheaded by the Japanese.  <br />Lt. Edward Skuzinski, navigator, disabled in crash, left by the Japanese to perish inside plane as the tide came in.  <br />Lt. Harold S. Mulhollen, pilot, killed in action.  <br /> <br />I'm writing this on the anniversary of Hiroshima, tell me again we shouldn't have dropped that bomb.	2005-08-06

This requires that the city adopt new traffic patterns, changes in the way people do things, bringing in tourists - many kinds of changes. Suppose a city was to be designed around a permanent event like that.  <br /> <br />This book is the result of a week long design workshop at the University of Catalunya in Barcelona (BCN). The workshop brought together architects, designers, educators, and students. What new urban and architectural forms, imagined along the parameters of speed and friction, might result, and how might they become an innovative model for urban form.  <br /> <br />The book is profusely illustrated, bilingual (English and Spanish). The workshop was intended to stretch the limits of design with no goal but to see what might result.	2005-08-05

It is used by many grad schools as part of their entrance criteria. This book is intended to give you an introduction to the test, provide the background you will need to know to score highly, and has practice questionsin the book.  <br /> <br />In addition there are four full-length practice tests on the CD-ROM. There is also an on-line web-site to provide additional information and still more testing. One component of the on-line material is a detailed score analysis of your score to tell you where you should concentrate your studying time.  <br /> <br />The GRE has three main components: math, verbal and analytical writing. Each of these areas has a major section in the book. Another big part of the book is the introduction and strategy sections which tell you what to expect on the test and how to approach it for the best results.  <br /> <br />While the exact questions for the next test are secret, the books study exams uses questions both like those used in past years and many of the actual questions.  <br /> <br />If you've used the Princeton Review books beforek you will not be surprised by this one.

This book attempts to strike a balance between the mathematics and the engineering. It is intended that the students have had one class in complex analysis and perhaps one in ordinary differential equations. It is aimed at the junior and senior level university students in engineering, particularly electrical engineering.  <br /> <br />While providing sufficient mathematical theory to give the student a reasonable background, the book uses MATLAB and the Control System Toolbox as aids in the actual design and analysis. It does not allow MATLAB knowledge to substiture for engineering knowledge.  <br /> <br />The first seven chapters of the book cover classical control theory, and is probably suited for a one semester class. The next chapters cover an introduction to nonlinear control, modern control, and the control of hybrid systems.  <br /> <br />The author is a professor at the Jerusalem College of Technology, Israel.	2005-08-05

One example is the new spiral bridge being built in the French Pyrenees, where the author was instrumental in its design. More about this bridge can be found at [...]  <br /> <br />The concept is that nature has created shapes and forms for all kinds of functions from the flight of a maple trees seed pod to the lattice of the sponge. The author is in the forefront of the effort to achieve architectural elegance from the study of biological forms - especially plant morphology. This book describes his current research.	2005-08-05

He says, and I believe correctly,  that the rest of the world, including the United States should be willing and able to help in this process.  <br /> <br />The courage being shown by the Israeli Government in withdrawing from Gaza is remarkable. As evidenced by yesterday's soldier getting on the bus and deliberately murdering four Arabs, there is a fundamentalist (or perhaps zealot is a better word) fringe group in Israel that is as dedicated to war as is the HAMAS organization in Gaza.  <br /> <br />All that we isolated individuals can do is hope that the crazy's on both sides don't take over the asylum, and be ready to help through the UN or directly as needed. Just a bit more peace in the Middle East would make so much sense.  <br /> <br />Mr. Makovsky's book is well thought out, well presented, and I hope the appropriate people in our own Government are thinking along the same lines. Well worth reading.	2005-08-05

And that something is usually the quality of its food. Note: New York here really means Manhattan, and to a slightly lessor extent the other boroughs.  <br /> <br />When I first picked up this book it fell open to page 86, polenta crostini with chanterelles. Polenta is grits. And in step 4 they fry the grits. That's almost the same as hush puppies. Then you add a topping of mushrooms and a couple of kinds of cheese. Well, now I know what's for dinner tonight. And any book that gives you a new recipe for grits has got to be pretty good.  <br /> <br />Kidding aside, this is a beautiful book. It is profusely illustrated and absolutely guaranteed to give you some ideas that you'll want to try. What more can you possibly ask out of a cookbook?  <br /> <br />It's been a while since I lived in the city. I've been thinking of going back for a visit.

So it is no surprise that once in a while a ship ends its days in a strange way. The stories of these ships are the ones told here.  <br /> <br />The first section of the book covers ships that sank, usually with enough of an interesting story to justify its inclusion. This includes ships like the Titanic, the Lusitania, and the battleship USS Maine. It also includes some lesser known ships that likewise sank, blew up, or otherwise died in a way that makes for a good story.  <br /> <br />The second part of the book is on ships that have ghostly tales told about them. This includes the Queen Mary, the Flying Dutchman, even the USS Thresher. These are stories that have remained current in spite of the current view that there can't possible be anything such as ghosts.  <br /> <br />The last section is on ships that have created mysteries that remain a mystery to this day. Here is the story of the Mary Celeste, found drifting and abandoned with a half finished dinner on the table. Here are the stories of some ships like the USS Cyclops, lost in the Bermuda Triangle.  <br /> <br />These stories are not new. The Mary Celeste was found in 1862, almost a hundred fifty years ago. In this book the story is well told, including separating out some commonly believed fiction. Recommended for anyone intersted in the sea.	2005-08-05

Of these 1400+ companies they selected companies who had ten years of OK financial results, followed by fifteen years of stellar performance. Companies that met this requirement are considered to have made the leap from being a good company to being a great company.  <br /> <br />The study then looked for common factors about these companies in an attempt to find what had enabled them to make this leap from good to great. To greatly summarize their findings:  <br /> <br />People count. The CEO is extremely important, and usually is promoted from within having a deep understanding of the company.  <br />Don't kid yourself. Look at the hard problems, at the companies core competences, the market opportunities and make these fit together.  <br />Manage carefully. Support, promote and bring people along while moving forward with focus.  <br /> <br />Obviously they looked at past data. The interesting point will be to see if these companies retain their greatness down through the coming years.	2005-08-04

I wonder if we are beginning to see a mainstream American center.  <br /> <br />During the Bush/Kerry election the book tables were filled with books screaming on one side or the other with no hint of compromise. Now there seems to be signs that a middle course is developing. This book is one example.  <br /> <br />Most of us are neither as left wing as the Democratic party officials would like to think, nor are we as right wing as the Republican party officials would like to think. Both parties seem to think that their far out views are the norm.  <br /> <br />The Republicans seem to have found a fundamentalist Christian belief set that they believe represents where America lies. They ignore that church attendance is falling each year.  <br /> <br />The Democrats mostly seem to be simply screaming how evil George W. is. They complain about his proposal for privitizing Social Security, yet I see no proposals from them at all, just screaming about what George W. wants.  <br /> <br />I am beginning to see a few books, like this one, that take more of a middle ground. I'm sure that both the left and right wings will find plenty to be angry about in this book -- just look at the reviews on Amazon.  <br /> <br />Instead I find his views and descriptions of people to pretty well fit. I lived in Louisiana when New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison was ranting and raving about the conspiracy that killed Kennedy. He finally took the case to court, and it was laughed at. Exit Jim Garrison. But Oliver Stone then picked up all of Garrison's wild-eyed conspiratorial theories and put them into the movie JFK as though they were fact. Oliver Stone deserves his position as number 65 on his list.  <br /> <br />Many of the names on his list I would replace with some of my own favorites, but as he says, this is his list.	2005-08-04

And investing in anything is making some predictions about what the future holds. There have been times when almost any investment you can name has done well. Then there have been other times.  <br /> <br />When you buy a mutual fund, especially a fund put together by one of the for-profit mutual fund you are basically paying for someone to be hired to make his best guesses about the future. You are also paying for the advertising costs of them to tell you about themselves, the commission to the salesman who sells it to you and so on. On the whole, these people have not been all that successful.  <br /> <br />Mr. Swensen discusses the mutual fund industry from an insiders viewpoint. He then presents an approach of using funds based on the common stock indexes. These would include the various Dows, the S&P, the Wiltshire 5000, or others. The funds should be purchased through non-profit organizations that operate the funds at just their cost. Without the 6 or 7 figure income paid to a hot stock fund manager and other expenses, the funds four out of five times outperform the managed fund.  <br /> <br />This kind of information is going to be very important as the investment aspect of social security debate continues (well, if it even gets started, so far I've just seen complaining, no alternative proposals).  <br /> <br />An excellent way to invest, even it it is somewhat duller than taking a high flyer.	2005-08-04

Yup! Suppose I want to build a factory to supply something to Los Angeles and San Francisco. I could locate the factory in either of these cities, or I could put it in some smaller town inbetween, or perhaps even in Nevada or Arizona and balance the shipping costs vs. manufacturing cost (which includes the cost of the factory, the land it is on, the prevailing wage rates, the local tax structure, and everything else). If the factory is going to cost me $100 million and Nevada lets say will give me $300 million to move there, do I really have a choice? Should I not ask what incentives they will give me?  <br /> <br />He seems angry at companies for playing off businesses.  Businesses owe their stockholders to cut the best deal they can. During the presidential debates, the candidates all talked about bringing jobs back to the mid-west, especially Ohio. They never mentioned the cost. I guess it was supposed to happen like magic.  <br /> <br />He's also right about the sports stadium. The Dallas Cowboys wanted a bigger, better stadium. Irving (where the stadium is located now) and Dallas, said no. Arlington said yes. There were protests. A bond issue was passed by the voters. My brother who lives in Irving is very happy, the game day traffic which totally plugged up the freeways will be moving to Arlington. The people in Arlington don't need to go anywhere on game days anyway.  <br /> <br />Yes, Mr. LeRoy, this is the way it is. Thanks for letting us know. Don't let the rage get to you so badly that you have a heart attack. It works the same the world over, China will incent you to build a factory, so will England, Russia, or Arlington, Texas.	2005-08-04

Writing something that is intended to be read is different than writing for television, radio, or anything else that is to be spoken. There are different techniques for the two approaches, and Mr. Sugarman is a consumate master of the written word.  <br /> <br />The concentration in this book is intended to be mail order writing -- sometimes in letter form, sometimes in the form of a brochure. Mail order advertising has a lot of advantages over other types of writing. The biggest one is that you have an almost instant measure of its success -- how many responses do you get. Then you can change the mailing package - any part of it, the writing, the typeface, the color of the envelope - and again you get an immediate response. There's no room for BS. And the successful people have to be good.  <br /> <br />Most of the orientation here is for direct response mail order. The interesting challenge of the next few years, or maybe the next few decades, is to convert this writing style to the web. At first glance, most of the techniques given here would seem to apply.

Much of life starts with conversation. To some of us it comes easy, to some of us it is very difficult. Perhaps the hardest is the conversation at a job interview, or that first conversation with someone to whom you are attracted.  <br /> <br />In the job interview, the interviewer will usually be asking questions. Your job is to provide the answers he wants to hear. Even if you decide you don't want the job, if you don't get an offer you don't get to decide.  <br /> <br />In the romantic area it's really much easier. If both of you are interested, the conversation will flow - once you get it started. If the other person isn't interested, there isn't anything you can do to change it, move on to the next person. Getting it started is your job, and as with the other situations where you need help, this book will give you some good ideas. Good ideas of both things to say, and things not to say.  <br /> <br />This book has eight chapters on the basics of being a good conversationalist. Then there are nine chapters on talking in various situations from the workplace to social events to talking with romance in mind. She knows what she is talking about.	2005-08-04

Partly it's a biographical sketch of Tennesee Williams, partly it's a review of the struggles gay and lesbian people had during the 1940's and '50's, partly it's an analysis of the homosexuality in Williams plays, partly it's an analysis of the critics writing about his plays. And all of that is a lot to put in one rather small book.  <br /> <br />Strangely enough, even with all that in the book, Mr. Paller pulls it off quite well. He is able to describe the gay-bashing of the time, and the tremendous internal struggles that this created in Williams. His descriptions of the critics analysis of the plays tells us a lot about the critics themselves, more about them than the plays.  <br /> <br />It's too much to say that this is a book that you can't put down. Instead I found it's a book that you read for a while, and then you want to think about what you've read before you go on.  <br /> <br />Tennessee Williams is probably America's foremost playwright. Some like Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Glass Menagerie,  A Streetcar Named Desire and more are still among the best plays ever done. The anguish in the writer in facing first his own discovery of his homosexuality and then finding it in the opressive eyes of the time make for quite a story.	2005-08-04

Here is another story of abuse, beatings, rape, drugs, unhealthy sex -- and that was before sixteen.  <br /> <br />From this start, how would you expect her to life. She can't have a good opinion of herself, the men she will find will tend to perpetuate her life up to now.  <br /> <br />She says that this 'tell all' autobiography is intended to provide an insight into an otherwise romanticized industry. It indeed does. It also isn't bad as a story in its own right. Perhaps the facing of her own life and getting it out in the open will help her to understand what has happened and be the starting point of developing a real life.  <br /> <br />This is not a plesant book to read, it leaves you with a feeling of great sadness. But it does leave you with a slight feeling of hope.	2005-08-04

It reminds me of the pro-Bush, anti-Bush books from just before the election. I wonder if they are by the same authors. Only now, here and there are books coming out that are written by the people actually involved in the operation.  <br /> <br />In the case of planning for Operation Iraqi Freedom, that responsibility was assigned to CENTCOM (Central Command) headquarters in Tampa, Florida.  <br /> <br />This book, written by the senior intelligence analyst for Iraq at CENTCOM describes the planning process, the questions being asked, the intelligence being gathered and the final plan developed for the invasion of Iraq. Obviously he has the advantage of hindsight, but also obviously, the plan worked when it was put into practice by the American and allied forces.  <br /> <br />This book provides a fascinating insight into how the planning process actually works within the military.	2005-08-03

This book is an almost hour by hour account of the development and use of the atomic bomb on Japan. It's not exactly an unknown story, but it's a story well told. This is what happened. Mr. Walker has done a supurb job of what happened on the ground in Japan, on board the Enola Gay, and back home in the states. It is a documentary of what happened, and does not go deeply into the thoughts and discussions of 'should we use the bomb,' 'should we do a demonstration first,' 'should we even build the bomb.'  <br /> <br />In recent years these subjects have come up in a sort of revisionist history. As best I can determine there was little to no discussion on these points before the bomb was dropped.  <br /> <br />Later on, Oppenheimer had a meeting with President Truman and expressed regret, sorrow, etc. Truman listened politely and after the meeting told his staff, 'don't set up another meeting with that cry baby.'  <br /> <br />One fun revisionist history deals with Hitler's mistakes and would it have been possible for him to have won the war. Answer -- NO! If the Germans had not already been defeated they would have gotten to see what the atomic bomb could do instead of the Japanese.  <br /> <br />Relatives of mine who were in the war against Germany were at home on leave before heading to the Pacific for the planned invasion of Japan. They believed to a man that the dropping of the bomb saved their lives. The estimates were for a million American casualties during the invasion. More Japanese than that would have bene killed. Instead the bombs killed maybe as many as a quarter million. Can you imagine the political fallout if an American president allowed a million American casualties to occur rather than use a weapon. Look at the screaming now when 1,700 have been killed in Iraq. <br /> <br />Down through the years I've talked to several young Japanese. They universally condemn the bombing. They knew nothing of the Bataan Death March, the Rape of Nanking, or Unit 731- the germ warfare unit set up by the Japanese which may have killed as many as 200,000 Chinese in their testing.	2005-08-03

This book covers the German fighter groups assigned to eastern front against Russia. By 1944 the front line German fighters were the FW-190 and the Me-109. Against the Americans and British the FW was the machine of choice. In the East it was still the Me as the Russian front line fighters were still inferior to the German machines.  <br /> <br />By late 1944 newer Russian aircraft became the equal to or exceeded the capabilities of the German fighters. By 1944 the enormous tank battle at Kursk had taken place, and the armored units were in bad shape. More and more of the burden fell on the German air force.  <br /> <br />Then in the middle of 1944 came the invasion and a new set of problems as the allies were quick to build fighter strips in France and brought over huge numbers of planes. This required the removal of some units from the Eastern Front.  <br /> <br />As with the other books in this series, this book is mostly photographs and drawings of the planes used by the various German units on the Eastern Front. A considerable amount of research went into determining the actual colors, markings, and other details of aircraft used by individual units.  <br /> <br />While Western historians and certainly movies would have you believe that the bulk of the fighting occured on the Western Front, the Eastern Front was the primary battleground so far as Germany was concerned. In 1944 the Russians admit to the loss of over 10,000 aircraft, the German loss was over 8,000.  <br /> <br />If aircraft color schemes are of interest to you, this book will be invaluable. If you are merely interested in the history of the Germans defending on the Eastern Frong, the photographs shown here present a story themselves that would be an excellent accompanyment to any written story.	2005-08-03

SQL Server Express 2005 has changed the rules about databases. To be sure it is a more limited version than the full blown SQL Server versions but FREE is such a nice price. The real limitations of 'Express' are: supports only one CPU, supports only 1 GB of memory, supports a database of only 4 GB. To be sure, there are a few features that would be nice to have (such as notification services), but you have to consider just how much more that would be worth.   <br /> <br />At this time only preliminary releases of the software are available, and that's what this book covers. If you were thinking of using MySQL or PostGre SQL on your next project, you might want to consider this instead.   <br /> <br />This book is a fairly general overview of the Express system, how to install it, what it contains, things like that. Transact-SQL, the programming language for SQL Server is only given about eight pages. Transact SQL is a big time SQL. You'll want a big book on that alone. This book is inexpensive and gives you a good introduction to what Microsoft is doing. It'll well worth the few dollars it costs.	2005-08-03

This is a book about a real life ten year old murder. The victim was the authors father.  <br /> <br />As she had progressed through life, the murder had left her with ghosts in her path and as she was preparing to marry she decided to go investigate the murder. The book reads almost like a fictional murder mystery. She interviewed the detectives who investigated the case. She talked with every relative (and there were a lot between the several marriages) she could find. Everyone had a story, no one had any idea who did it.  <br /> <br />By the end she had no better idea of the killer than when she started, but she had resolved some of the questions and puzzlements in her own life, and reestablished a relationship with her family. For her, that had to be enough.	2005-08-03

This book covers the German fighter groups assigned to defend Germany from the British and American bombers. By 1944 the numbers of bombers had grown significantly from the early days. At the same time, the long ranged P-51's were now available in quantity as well.  <br /> <br />Germany was now using the FW-190's in the earlier A models and the later inline engined D models. Their pilots were told to ignore the fighters and attack the bombers. Following orders, the German pilots attacked the bombers and were shot down by the fighters who soon learned that they were relatively safe from attack.  <br /> <br />Then in the middle of 1944 came the invasion and a new set of problems as the allies were quick to build fighter strips in France and brought over huge numbers of planes.  <br /> <br />As with the other books in this series, this book is mostly photographs and drawings of the planes used by the various German units on the western front. A considerable amount of research went into determining the actual colors, markings, and other details of aircraft used by individual units.  <br /> <br />Two points jumped out at me as I read the book. First, at the beginning of the book some aircraft are shown being towed around the airfield by trucks. By the end of the book aircraft are being towed around by oxen, reflecting the extreme measures being taken to conserve fuel. Second, as the east and west fronts got closer, a number of eastern front aircraft are shown where the pilot deliberately flew to the west and surrendered to the Allies.  <br /> <br />If aircraft color schemes are of interest to you, this book will be invaluable. If you are merely interested in the history of the Germans defending on the western front, the photographs shown here present a story themselves that would be an excellent accompanyment to any written story.	2005-08-03

A lot of people have died that way. Mr. Dray correctly says that Franklin was a very good scientist. Yes, he was, but more than that he was a very lucky scientist, he lived through that experiment.   <br /> <br />Mr. Dray views Franklin as an established scientist who at a later time took up the cause of American independence. And he presents a very good case for this point of view. I wonder though how Franklin thought of himself. He was not a professor of science at one of the big schools, he was a publisher/printer concerned with running a business.   <br /> <br />Franklin was certainly no slouch as a scientist. As a result of his studies on electricity he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. That didn't happen then, and it doesn't happen now to the casual bumbling experimenter.   <br /> <br />Still, regardless of the scientific point of view, this is a biography of Franklin. And you come out of reading this with a feeling that Franklin would have been a very good fellow to know.	2005-08-03

His description of how you will be treated by the drill sergeants is completely accurate. His recommendations for getting into shape first is a good idea, it will save you pain later on.  <br /> <br />Now I've got to put in a few words of my own. ==The basic rules of how you will be treated in basic can be traced down from the training program developed by the Greeks to teach people how to fight in their phalanx. The training works because the raw material, young men, hasn't changed all that much. (Yes, it also works for women.) Yes, the details change -- there wasn't much training in machine guns before the time of Christ -- but the screaming drill sergeants were there then.  <br /> <br />This book starts with getting to your basic training unit. Before that you will have reported to a reception station. You will probably arrive at the reception station about 3 in the morning, they want you tired, somewhat disoriented, pliable so that you acclimated to the screaming quickly. The stay at the reception station is horrible. You know no one, you have no idea what is happening, where you are going, it's chaos. It's actually semi-organized, just relax as much as you can and go with the flow. The book says you will get lots of sleep and be well fed. I didn't find it so. It was worse than basic.  <br /> <br />The training in basic, physical, mental, and technical is carefully designed to take in almost any body and convert them to a soldier. It works, almost no one flunks out. Some have a harder time than others in any of the three areas, but 99% of the recruits make it, it's designed that way.  <br /> <br />If a year or so later you on run into your drill sergeant, chances are he won't remember you. You were only one of the thousands he trained. You can probably buy him a beer and find out that he's really a pretty nice guy. It was all a show.	2005-08-03

The discussion here is not on the rules or the odds (although there's a little bit on odds). Instead it's more of a tale of playing the game at the upper levels. It's a story of how Mr. Greenstein has lived his life as a professional poker player.  <br /> <br />Beautifully printed with hundreds of full color photographs of people (un-identified in the text, but captions in the back of the book), casinos, and game rooms -- this could almost be considered a coffee table book. It comes across as an introduction to a world that most of use will never know, or really even want to know. It's a book, though that's written well enough about a certain lifestyle that it's hard to put down. You want to find out what happens. Then at the end of the book there is an analysis of several hands of poker that shows how an advanced player thinks. These hands are complex enough that for us beginners they are barely understandable.	2005-08-03

It basically allows the creation of a whole new class of database operations that can be written in TSQL and which run asynchronously as part of a queued system.   <br /> <br />This concept adds a whole new dimension to SQL programming. It is an enormous extension to the standard capabilities of the language. As an example, a web server running an order entry application takes an order and puts it into the database. It quickly releases the web server to allow it to handle the next order. At the same time it puts information into a que to allow the back end processing of the order, inventory control, shipping, etc. to take place on a basis of operating when resources either on the database machine handing the order entry or an entirely different machine.   <br /> <br />This book is written by the Group Program Manager for SQL Server Service Broker. It is the first book available and is based on the Beta release of the software. As I write this, the third Beta for SQL Server 2005 is available on the Microsoft web site. This Beta includes Service Broker as described in this book.	2005-08-03

Sometimes they forget that wild does really mean wild. It appears that in this case a lesson was needed that bears are not just people in brown furry clothes.  <br /> <br />Timothy Treadwell was a character. He had a love for the bears in Alaska's Katmai National Park. For thirteen years he had studied the bears, promoted his actions, and developed some controversial ideas about the bears. His actions and attitudes earned him the scorn of hunters, the adoration of some animal lovers, and the skepticism of professional naturalists.  <br /> <br />He rejected the conventional wisdom of experts on observing dangerous wildlife to live with the bears themselves. In the end, it cost him his life and that of his girl friend.  <br /> <br />This book tells Treadwell's story, but further than that goes deeply into bears, bear behavior and the lengthy relationship between humans and bears. I was surprised at the caliber of writing. I'm going to look up more books by Mr. Jans and keep an eye out for new books he may publish.	2005-08-02

We have a long tradition of separation of church and state, where the rules of church and state seem to operate in parallel with almost no touching. And we seem to be in a time where the most fundamentalist Christian beliefs have become stronger in America while the most fundamentalist Islamic beliefs are being used to build an army for a holy war against America, the Great Satan.  <br /> <br />At the same time we see that under the guise of religious behavior we find Mormon polygamous families where the patriarch marries the thirteen year old children of other members of their cult. We find that Catholic priests, once held at the highest esteem are being regularly accused of molesting young boys. We find families holding their children out of schools that teach what they decide offends their religion, leaving their children ill prepared to face a life outside their particular restricted community. We find other families that because of their religious beliefs refuse medical care that would save the life of children.  <br /> <br />This book covers these interactions of the church and the state from the standpoint of the United States Constitution and the subsequent laws that have been passed by Congress. It is particularily apt for this time in our history and very highly recommended.	2005-08-02

It was a masterpiece of logical deduction based on the observations he had made while serving as a naturalist aboard the H.M.S. Beagle on a scientific expedition around the world. His views were both orthodox for the day and flawed.  <br /> <br />Only seven years later Mendel published the results of his research on genetics. Over time these sciences were merged together into what is now called the 'Modern Synthesis.' Genetics explains the why and the how of species begetting species, and how changes in the species are made when a change is made in the genes.  <br /> <br />In 1944, with the advances in mathematics, von Neumann and Morgenstern published 'Theory of Games and Economic Behavior.' Over time the modern synthesis of the genertic approach to evolution has been fit into game theory to help understand how the randomness of genetic evolution can be predicted using game theory.  <br /> <br />This book gives a rigorous introduction to the mathematics of game theory as applied to Natural Selection. The book presents the tools necessary for understanding many of Nature's mysteries.	2005-08-02

(All in all, as of today there have been about 1,700 deaths, roughly what we kill on the highways every ten days or so.)  <br /> <br />And on the tables at bookstores I find books talking about how we are failing, and failing disastrously in Iraq. But these books are right next to the ones that say we are being extremely successful in restoring democracy in Iraq. (Kind of like the stacks of anti-Bush books just before the election, right next to the pro-Bush book stacks.) (I wonder if the stacks of books have the same authors.)  <br /> <br />Once in a while you find a book like this one. It's isn't strident in either direction. Instead it reports on what one small unit of soldiers is doing in Iraq to make it a better place. This fits pretty closely with the reports that I've received from the few Iraqi people that I've met.  <br /> <br />This is the story of Civil Affairs Team-A 13 (CAT-A 13) as they help to rebuild a war-ravaged area. They represent the absolute best that our country has to offer, and it's great to see that they get some of the recognition that they deserve.  <br /> <br />This book won't change the minds of the stridents on either side, but for those of us interested in what's really going on it's good to hear.	2005-08-02

He was condemned to lifelong imprisonment.  <br /> <br />In 1777 a group of people gathered in Paris to prepare an Encyclopedie that would encompass all of human knowledge. It was based on the most current scientific knowledge of the time and generally ignored the thinking and belief system of the church.  <br /> <br />At this point in time, only 144 years from the time when Galileo had been convicted, the writers would have been killed if the church had known that they were atheists.  <br /> <br />The material that they published was bad enough that the book was banned by the Pope. And during the sixteen years it took to write, compile, and produce all twenty seven volumes the authors were constantly risking jail, exile and censorship. Still they continued.  <br /> <br />This book is the story of the people who wrote the Encyclopedie, the Paris they lived in, their lives and the writing. This was a time that was setting the stage for the French Revolution that was soon to follow. <br /> <br />In 1992 Pope John Paul II gave an address in which he admitted that errors had bene made by the theological advisors in the case of Galileo. He declared the case closed, but he did not admit that the Church was wrong to convict Galileo.	2005-08-02

The story of Waterloo has been told so many times, by so many people, that you have to wonder just what a re-telling can add. ==The answer is: 'quite a lot.'  <br /> <br />First, this new book is written by an Italian historian and novelist. He has an outsiders viewpoint that bring a perspective different than that of a French or English historian. He treats the Prussian Army, advancing from the north with more attention than normally shown. He gives the German forces actually serving under Wellington more attention than they are usually shown. His novelist experience give him a writing style far more interesting than the normal dry writing of the typical historian.  <br /> <br />Second, he is writing at a time when a definitive book on Waterloo hasn't been done in several years. As a reult, new material that is constantly being found can be incorporated into the new book.  <br /> <br />This book just covers the battle. There is an absolute minimum of background information taking up space. But there is more insight to the overall events and their aftermath in terms of the overall impact on history.  <br /> <br />This new book is a welcome addition to the literare on this most famous battle.	2005-08-02

Convention of 1940 and How It Freed FDR to Save the Western World	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A Story of a Pivotal Election	The 1940 Presidential election was one of the more interesting and more important elections in US history.  <br /> <br />It was a time when the bulk of the American public was strongly isolationism, while a world view of Germany and Japan called for cooperation with the rest of the world to stop them.  <br /> <br />It was a time of a calm before the storm as Pearl Harbor was only about a year away. With that incident, the mood of the country changed immediately to make America ready to go to war.  <br /> <br />It was a time when FDR was running for a third time. Something that had never happened before and which later was made impossible by the twenty-second amendment. (The 1940 Republican platform called for a two term limit.)  <br /> <br />It was a time when foreign intelligence services were active in trying to influence the American political system. The Germans were running isolationist advertisments in newspapers, ostensively being placed there by isolationist politicians. The British intelligence service was active including supplying a mistress to the leading Republican candidate. (The subject of foreign intelligence activities in the election of 1940 would make a good book in its own right, it's just touched on here.)  <br /> <br />As a forerunner of things to come, the Republican platform called for an end to discrimination against the Negros in the military, the civil service, and all areas of Government. This subject was to wait a long time before the Democrats made it their own issue.  <br /> <br />Philip Roth's novel 'The Plot Against America' imagined what would have happened if an isolationist Republican president had been elected over FDR. Now this book does an excellent job examining another aspect of the election. There is a lot yet to be learned about this pivotal election.	2005-08-02

In that book Cornwell says that fundamentally the Pope was a pro-Nazi anti-semite. (By religion John Cornwell is Catholic.)  <br /> <br />Now Rabbi David Dalin has come out with this book to refute Mr. Cornwell's book. Rabbi Dalin says that Pope Pius the XII actively spoke out against the Nazis and did all that was possible to assist the Jews to escape. At the same time, he talks about Hajj Amin al-Husseini, one of several Arabic leaders who were actively working for a German victory.  <br /> <br />Having read both books, and know of the subject being mentioned in a dozen more I come to the conclusion that this book is more truthful than the others. The Pope lived surrounded by the German War machine. One false move and Hitler might well have taken over the Vatican. He had to tread a very careful line. It appears that he did enough to assist and save many thousands of Jews whose other fate would have been much worse.  <br /> <br />I would say that if this is an area which interests you, you definitely need to read both books. This one has, to me, the ring of truth, backed up by most of the othr books I've read on the subject.	2005-08-01

Robert Oppenheimer: and the Birth of the Modern Arms Race	Books	5	34	37	N	N	A Man of Great Strengths and Great Weaknesses	In studying Oppie I am reminded of the old saying about 'Gods too have feet of clay.' Oppie was a man of great talents, and some characteristics that I don't know if could be called great failures or not.   <br /> <br />This book concentrates on the 1949 to 1955 period. These were the McCarthy years, when rumor, accusations, and the red scare. World War II was over, the Soviets, under Stalin had imposed the iron curtain. And it had become clear that communist spies in England and the United States had delivered the secrets of the atomic bomb to them.   <br /> <br />As you might guess from the title, this book is very pro Oppenheimer. She blames Air Force officials, anti-Communist politicians, and competing scientists, particularily Edward Teller for seizing control of the U.S. nuclear policy and building ever more deadly weapons. Her telling of what happened is clear. Her philosophical tone is a bit more questionable.   <br /> <br />She asks: Could development of the H-bomb have been averted? -- As a physicist I'll answer - No! It could be done (they thought at the time and were right), it would have been too intriguing a scientific question to let it pass. If not exactly at that time, then it would have been later. And considering the political situation at the time, no question that it would have been done.   <br /> <br />She is very good about Oppie's weaknesses. After making an emotional appeal to Truman, Truman is rumored to have said, 'don't let that cry baby back into my office.'   <br /> <br />There's a question I've always wondered, she doesn't answer it, I don't know that there is an answer. After the loss of his security clearance his influence on science policy was over. He became the director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton. He thought and wrote about the problems of intellectual ethics, morality, and the most advanced subjects in physics. Was he as happy doing this as he had been in the public eye?	2005-08-01

It is 700+ mages of the highest quality photographs, printed on very high quality heavy weight paper, of the most impressive residential interiors I've ever seen. The title says it best, here are Inspirations. The views shown here are guaranteed to give you a world of ideas. A lot of the pictures appear to have been taken in Europe, where I think the general style level is higher than it is in this country.  <br /> <br />The book is organizied into separate sections covering:  <br /> <br />Entrances & Hallways  <br />Kitchens  <br />Dining Rooms  <br />Living Rooms  <br />Bedrooms  <br />Bathrooms  <br />Home Offices  <br />Terraces  <br />Garages  <br /> <br />Yes, Garages, of course when you garage houses a Maserati, a Mercedes and a couple of Jag XKE's, you want something to show them off well.  <br /> <br />The sections vary in size depending on the importance of the room - Living rooms get 110 pages, Garages only 42. And as you might guess, they are not pictures of low end track houses. But if you are looking into the design of a high end custom house, this book will provide inspirations.	2005-08-01

Some marketing programs simply work better than others. Here in one (large) book is a collection of the best programs put together by the best in the business. With this new edition, the latest trends in direct marketing are discussed giving them exposure along with the old standbys. Also some of the techniques (sweepstakes) that were huge a few years back have crashed in popularity. Their story is included.  <br /> <br />One big change since the last edition of the book is the growth of the Internet. Still in its infancy (direct mail has been around for about 800 years) I view the Internet and E-Mail marketing as a baby, but an important one to watch as it grows up. In general Mr. Hatch has a fairly negative view of the Internet as an advertising medium. I think he's just not seen the effectiveness yet. Amazon sold 1.5 million copies of the latest Harry Potter book before the book was published. That's a pretty good sized business.	2005-07-28

It is refreshing to see that throughout Mr. Hendra's life (from age 14 up) there was Father Joe, a man so solid in his faith and in his life that he becomes a rock upon which Mr. Hendra was able to anchor his own life.  <br /> <br />Mr. Hendra a prolific and accomplished writer lived a life of ups and downs. Tragedies like the two miscarriages, a failed marriage, some substance abuse are combined with successes both in business and personal life (attributed by Hendra to Father Joe).  <br /> <br />This is a story of the redemption of one man who at the end returns to the faith that sustains him. This is a story also filled with delightful humor as only Tony Hendra can write.	2005-07-28

She spends most of the time talking about the Italians who conquered it, the British who chased them out, and the Americans who built an electronic listening post and staffed it with about 4,000 people. She is careful to point out how these countries, and the rest of the world, could have done better.  <br /> <br />In this she is right. But just to blame the outside world is to provide excuses that will not help the country move on. African nations have plenty of ability to mess up their own lives. The outside world is not responsible for the spread of the AIDS emergency in Eritrea, that's a life style of their own choosing. The outside world is not responsible for the hundreds, if not thousands of years while this region was filled with corruption, slavery, and violence.  <br /> <br />And while Eritrea is a mess, so is a lot of Africa. The genocide in Rwanda comes to mind. The present situation with Robert Mugabe in Zinbabwe has taken a bread basket nation and converted it to starvation. If we could do anything, where would we start? Ms. Wrong has a lot of opportunities to pick African countries in big troubles.	2005-07-28

I have met people like Joey O'Shay who have such a deep seated drive to wipe out the drug business that they almost couldn't function doing anything else. Popeye Doyle of French Connection fame was one.  <br /> <br />I've also seen them reach the point where perhaps they have been shot a time or two, perhaps they have looked at all the drugs that the French Connection stopped from comming into the country ($32,000,000) doesn't mean that drugs are any harder to get. (In fact police tell me that the drugs on the street are of higher quality and lower price than ever before.) Then like Joey O'Shay they begin to question the futility of our never ending war on drugs. And somewhere along there Mr. O'Shay you'd better find a way to leave this life behind.  <br /> <br />I do not profess to know the answer to the drug problem, but, Guys, this isn't working.  <br /> <br />As you might guess, in this book Joey O'Shay is a cop on the undercover drug beat. He's being very successful, but the people he puts away are replaced immediately. He's involved with another huge drug deal. He's having a problem understanding that winning the battles he is fighting isn't winning the war.	2005-07-28

They were also much more heavily armed, much more like the German E-Boats. During World War II they were mass produced and used in a wide variety of tasks from air sea rescue, mine laying, coast line patrol, etc.  <br /> <br />In this book, John Lambert gives an exhaustive coverage of the boat. His concentration is on the D model, the most heavily armed, but he also covers the earlier craft that preceeded the D.  <br /> <br />The book is profusely illustrated with what seems like most, if not all, of the pictures ever taken of the boats. With his encyclopedic knowledge of the vessels, many of the illustrations are commented with details of changes made to the boat after it left the factory. In addition, there are numerous line drawing of the various boats that show precisely the details sometimes obscured in photographs.	2005-07-28

To be sure, the book is certainly for advanced Excel users, but it won't help you do an advanced business application.  <br /> <br />You'd best have some knowledge about Excel before starting this one. There's a brief survey of Excel at the beginning that starts off comparing a spreadsheet to an accountant's ledger. That's pretty basic. Anyone with any Excel experience at all can follow the first three pages. On page four he is talking about making a thousand point plot with random numbers, normal distribution -- no longer something from Excel for Dummies. By page 5 he's calculating averages and standard deviations. By the end of this Survey chapter he's talking about the accuracy of the calculations performed by Excel.  <br /> <br />Subsequent chapters discuss various types of mathematical manipulation that are often needed in the analysis of scientific data.  <br /> <br />There are three chapters on Least Squares. This is the fitting of a curve to collected data so that the trends might be more easily visualized.  <br /> <br />There is a chapter on Fourier Transformations, which is the probably the most frequently used analysis tool when working in signal processing. Geophysical  seismic data, radar receivers, cell phone systems are all processed primarily using Fourier Transforms. This kind of data is of course too voluminous for Excel, but the techniques used here would be ideal for quite a number of laboratory applications.  <br /> <br />A couple of chapters cover convolution, deconvolution, and time-frequency analysis as well as Numerical integration of ordinary differential equations.  <br /> <br />All of these processing tasks are done using macros. These are described in the book, or can be downloaded from the author's website -- [...] This web site also includes some additional macros that enhance Excel's computationability when handling numbers of higherprecision.  <br /> <br />The final four chapters of the book are on writing your own or modifying existing macros, with an orientation to scientific analysis.  <br /> <br />I consider this to be almost a mandatory book for anyone interested in using Excel to analysis scientific data.	2005-07-27

Instead it's about selecting the play you might want to put on.  <br /> <br />And it's description of some plays you might want to consider is very good. It gives you the story of what's happening, but far more information of a specialized nature that you need to know. For instance, how many performers, what kind of sets, costumes, props, special effects, etc. A very important detail given about the plays is where to go get rights. This can save you a lot of time.  <br /> <br />I have only three complaints about the book. First it needs updating, there are a lot of new plays you might consider. Second, it needs a section on smaller plays. My stage needs plays with 6-8 people, few of the ones listed here are that small. Third, the book needs to be about three times as long, I'd like to see all the plays that are available in a format done like this.	2005-07-27

William Lynch to circumnavigate the Dead Sea was approved by the Navy. The specific goal of the expedition was to establish the elevation of the Dead Sea. He also intended to collect mineral and other specimens. What he really wanted to do was to find the ruins of Sodom and Gomorrah.  <br /> <br />Traven in these days was not nearly as easy as it is now. Lynch had a 'metallic' boat which he proposed to travel. But the horses that were to pull the boat were broken to the saddle, not harness. That was just the beginning.  <br /> <br />This book tells the story of this expedition, but more than that puts it into place as a story of the time as well. This is a little known episode in the history of the U.S. Navy.	2005-07-27

Once there we live with a woman living a life so alien to ours that it could have been science fiction. But it isn't.  <br /> <br />The life of Chinese women comes through almost as a life long prison sentence handed out when seven years old and just because they were born female. Here we see an acceptance of traditions that we now see as evil. In particular foot binding, painfully binding the girls feet to make them small, three inches long, about the length of a finger. And strangely enough this was a custom that continued for nearly a thousand years.  <br /> <br />In this book you visit with 83 year old Lily, as she pens her autobiography. More than that, you live her life, and you cry more than she does.	2005-07-27

Arleigh Burke started the war as a commander on shore duty at the Washington Navy Yard, also known as the Naval Gun Factory. His superior officer refused to let him go.  <br /> <br />Eventually he got orders to go to the South Pacific, it had been twenty years since he had graduated from the Naval Academy. From there his career skyrocketed. Twenty years younger than Nimitz/Halsey he was the most famous Naval officer in active service after the war. He eventually became Chief of Naval Operations under Eisenhower. He was the CNO for an unprecedented six years.  <br /> <br />The author of this book served in the Navy during World War II, and afterwards was a civilian faculty member of the Naval Academy. His biographies of Nimitz and Halsey won numerous awards and was selected by Burke and some of his friends as biographer. Admiral Burke, by then unable to read because of failing eyesight, listened to the book as it was read by his wife and assisted in the correction of errors.  <br /> <br />This book is well written and brings interesting insight not only to the story of World War II, but of the political happenings afterward when Truman wanted to unify the services in an attempt to do away with the inter-service rivalry.	2005-07-27

We like to think of Lincoln as the Great Emancipator. Mr. Lind is careful to point out that he was no slouch as a politician. You don't get elected to that office without being an accomplished professional politician. Perhaps the Great Emancipator is a title, a view that we hold of him several generations later.<br /><br />Mr. Lind spends a good bit of time on the definition of the United States as a nation vs. an alliance of sovereign states. Mr. Lind shows Lincoln's vision of the United States as a model of liberty and democracy for the world. Mr. Lincoln's model seemed to be that a state had the liberty to join the Union, but did not have the liberty to leave.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed reading Mr. Lind's book. I do question some of his conclusions. They are based on the thinking of a man raised in a culture offset from Lincoln's by a hundred and fifty years.	2005-07-27

He pegged me like an entomologist peggs a bug with a pin to it's place in the collection. (If you're curious, I found my home in the Big Empty.)  <br /> <br />Then his next book Edge Cities, about the definition of new and growning centers of culture, business, etc around the edge of the Big Cities that have become too big, too crime ridden, too expensive again helped define what I was looking for.  <br /> <br />Now he's done this one on what the future may hold. He investigates a lot of leading edge scientific projects and examines what the future may be like if they truly come to pass bringing the 'benefit' that they promise. He then ties these into three senarios that he calls Heaven, Hell and Prevail.  <br /> <br />His descriptions of where science may be going is great. His forecasts of the future remind me of the old saying that 'Predicting the future is easy, it's being right that's difficult.'  <br /> <br />Whatever the future holds, it won't be as forecast. It'll be something different. Perhaps, indeed, almost certainly it will contain elements of all three senarios Mr. Garreau is describing. But it will also have big changes forced on it by the every increasing shortage of oil. The AIDS pandemic is just getting a good start, and so far at least I don't see any immediate end. Warfare is changing with al-Qaida on the one hand and the nuclear aspirations of North Korea and Iran.  <br /> <br />This book is a great attempt at laying out one direction the world can go, it's worth reading for that alone. Just keep an open mind.	2005-07-27

As a man, it is impossible for me to every understand the female friendship, it is simply twoo alien.  <br /> <br />It seems that the two women share a part of their life in a way men simply do not. There seem to be few, if any, secrets (men don't tell each other much of anything). There seems to be an emotional bonding that men never reach, perhaps this is part of the female carrying the emotional content of a family.  <br /> <br />I read this book then from a standpoint different than the female reader. I was wondering if the stories of friendships breaking up would provide any enlightenment. I must say that they did not. Perhaps mens lives are just easier. If there is someone you decide that you miss you call then and say \\"how about a beer.\\"  <br /> <br />I did find the book to be most interesting as an insight into the depth of feelings that women have regarding friends. This book should be a starting point for a whole bunch of Ph.D. theses on using this as a way to better explain certain thought patterns.	2005-07-27

His achievements were great, but only because a bunch of inventors went before him. He too stood on the shoulders of giants, he just didn't admit it.  <br /> <br />Andrea Sutcliffe has done a good job here of pulling together the history of the development of steam powered vessels in the United States.  <br /> <br />She mentions that Henry Miller Shreve (after whom Shreveport, Louisiana was named) built some steam boats. I tend to say that the thing Robert Fulton built was really a steam ship, that is a deep draft vessel, suitable for use in deep rivers like you find in the Northeast. Shreve invented (along with some help of course) the typical Mississippi River Steamboat.  <br /> <br />This is probably not important, but when we think of the early boats, we tend to think of riverboats on the Mississippi not the early boats on the Hudson.  <br /> <br />Recommended book.	2005-07-26

Then again I didn't realize just how many different insurgencies are going on at any one time. In fact, he concentrates on the contemporary world, only mentioning in passing that Roman Armies also fought insurgents.  <br /> <br />Part of a scientific analysis is to classify them into types based on common attributes. By assigning names to these classes, we make it so that we can use these names and immediately know what kinds of programs have worked against them in the past, and of course what have not.  <br /> <br />Dr. O'Neill has looked into the Types of Insurgencies, Politics and forms of Warfare, Insurgent Strategies, the Physical Environment, the Human Environment, Types of Popular Support, Organizational Structure,  External Support, and Government Response.  <br /> <br />Through these classifications, he is, for the first time beginning to draw together a consistent approach to the study of terroism. Perhaps this is the start of a Terrorism Science to go along with Naval Science or Military Science.	2005-07-26

His history through the Mongols, the British and others was quite good. This alone makes the book well worth reading.  <br /> <br />It's when he gets to the last chapter on where do we go from here that I find his thoughts a little weak. For instance he would like to see a UN multinational peacekeeping force take over security. My own experience doesn't show a lot of faith in these, they were in Bosnia remember.  <br /> <br />He says, American firms have been given the inside track on all the major reconstruction contracts, while most Iraqi and firms from other countries have been excluded. Then he says firms from France, Germany, Russia and Canada have been excluded. If it's American money being spent, we should have some say in who gets it. And excluding four countries still leaves a hundred or more countries that could bid. France and Russia in particular were illegally selling Iraq weapons under the oil for food program. Excluding them now doesn't seem at all unreasonable. If France should want to pay for some of the reconstruction, they can use a French firm to do it.  <br /> <br />I am reminded of the comment made during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. \\"If these were countries without oil some low level State Department clerk would issue a statement of regret and then gone off on vacation.\\"  <br /> <br />But they do have oil.  <br /> <br />And they do have al-Qaida	2005-07-26

The 2005 issue is one of the most interesting volumes yet.   <br /> <br />The first article is on the failure of British armor piercing big gun shells to pierce armor and then to fail to explode. It is surprising to me that such little details seemingly are ignored until a country goes to war, ships have sunk, and people have died. I was reminded of the failure of the American (and German) torpedoes to explode. After all the effort put into submarines, training the crew and sending them off to war, it appears that only one live test of a torpedo had been run and it had failed.   <br /> <br />Another article is on the early steam powered torpedo boats built by the Royal Navy in the late 1800's. These definitely do not look like they would be good boats on which to serve. I had seen pictures of them before but the article goes into things like sea keeping, and life on board as well as more technical details on the ships.   <br /> <br />The articles in this book are not short, averaging something over a dozen pages. Annual columns reviewing the navies of the world, a gallery of pictures and others take up about a quarter of the book.   <br /> <br />As usual, this is a fascinating book. It brings up points of history that aren't seen very often. It's very very well written. Highly recommended to any interested person.	2005-07-26

Except that the first time you do it you're going to screw up badly. In order to make as much sense as he does, the writer of this book must have screwed up several installations. It's clear that he knows whereof he speaks.  <br /> <br />There are only a couple of areas that I'd stress more highly. He talks of power and cooling. A lot of people used such figures, especially people who were setting up big co-location centers. Then these new 1U and 2U servers started coming out, and the number of watts per square foot or meter skyrocketed. Watts were a direct measure of power needed, and in turn of the amount of cooling needed. It also seems that every new Intel processor needs more power. The new Pentium D takes about 140 watts. Four of them in a 2U cabinet is over 600 watts per unit (adding a little for other stuff). 24 of these in a rack is 14,400 watts in about a square meter. The highest rating he shows is 2,000 watts per square meter. Do some calculating before you design.  <br /> <br />The next thing I'd add is put your backup center a long ways away from your primary center, like maybe in Europe. A fully redundant center in the same building when an earthquake/bomb/hurricane/fire cuts off power/telephone or whatever does you no good. You might want to outsource this secondary site, just as he says. Or maybe you can put it in the London office and get a good excuse to go visit once in a while. <br /> <br />This book is just about the best summary of data center facility design I've seen.	2005-07-26

There will be at least one more Beta release before the first actual product release. Note that the product may not be called Indigo at the actual release. As I am writing this review, the Beta1 release of Indigo is available on the Microsoft web site.  <br /> <br />Microsoft continues to expand their offerings based on their .NET technologies. Indigo is the code name for Microsoft's next generation Web Services technology. This concept is intended to provide a better way of enabling business applications to be distributed among multiple systems.  <br /> <br />This book describes the architecture and concepts embedded into Indigo as well as programming. It has sufficient information that fully operational and secure can be developed. The concluding chapters in the book talk about, and give code for, two distributed applications, one for an enterprise wide order processing system and another for a digital whiteboard so that all participants in a widely distributed can be looking at the same screen.  <br /> <br />Indigo stresses interoperability, but seems to use the word differently than the rest of us. I don't see anything about operating in other environments such as Linux. If, however, you are headed towards Indigo, here is the way to get started.	2005-07-25

Here is where they put in all the new technology first. So any improvements in components such as the CCD's will be here first. While point and shoot cameras now usually have 3 to 4 megapixels of resolution, the digital SLRs start at about 6. The new Nikon D2X has 12. Do you need this much, maybe, maybe not, but Digital SLR's get this kind of thing first.  <br /> <br />Second, Digital SLR's have more controls, interchangable lenses, every accessory known to man and so on. More control give you more the ability to do things that you simply couldn't do with the earlier cameras. It also offers you more opportunity to screw up, but with the LCD viewer you can catch this faster.  <br /> <br />This book is a general introduction to the features you typically find on Digital SLR's and what you get with those features. It is not so much a description of what cameras are available with what features, there are magazines to do that -- and still they go out of date quickly. Here you will find more generalized information to help you decide what features you really need.  <br /> <br />This is the most complete generalized introduction to what these cameras do that I've ever seen. Buy it before you spend a lot of money on a camera, relatively speaking it's cheap.	2005-07-25

And the answer is a whole range of new and different weapons. Some of these were big and designed for attacking the United States after being launched from Germany. Some were small guided weapons to be launched from aircraft against high priority targets.  <br /> <br />There are several brief discussions on the German nuclear weapons programs. This includes missile designs with proposed nuclear warheads. I am skeptical of the authors interpretation of these designs. What little information I've seen on the German program says that they made very little progress, even that the basic fundamental theories that Werner Heisenberg were so badly flawed that even if they had been able to gether the components it is likely that they would have blown themselves up rather than actually produced a bomb.  <br /> <br />The first bombs were big - 5000-7000 pounds, Heisenberg's design was much bigger than that. Note that just because I'm skeptical doesn't mean that the German scientists weren't working on the problem.  <br /> <br />This book covers development areas that have been generally ignored in the press. I presume that it is in part based on information from what was East Germany that wasn't available until recently.  <br /> <br />The book appears to have been put together based on relatively little hard information. But after that many years, it isn't surprising that projects which never came to pass would be hard to find out about at all.	2005-07-25

It starts off with this is what a firewall is and this is why you need one up through each step along the way to a very secure system.  <br /> <br />The author is a lead network engineer for the University of Kentucky. It's clear that so far as a firewall is concerned, he's been there and done that. His description of what is done/examined/checked about incoming packets before passing them through the firewall is the best I've ever seen. Unlike so many computer books, his introductory chapters tell you the 'this is what we are trying to do here' before getting down to the type this in kind of commands.  <br /> <br />This book is based on Cisco hardware and the Cisco philosophy of how a firewall should be implemented. If it is your job to handle a Cisco firewall of any type I recommend this book. It concentrates on ASA and PIX (Version 7), if you have (or are getting) one of them this book should be considered mandatory.	2005-07-25

The story of the Wave Dancer only serves to remind us that any mistakes, any assumption will once in a while turn out to be deadly.  <br /> <br />In retrospect, you can find the mistakes they made, you can establish a policy that says no one stays on board when a hurricane is forecast, but as the people in the path of the tsunami learned, sometime it just isn't enough.  <br /> <br />This is the detailed story of the Wave Dancer, told by an eye witness and through interviews with many of the survivors. Beyond that, Mr. Burnworth turned out to be a pretty good writer as well.  <br /> <br />This incident didn't kill nearly as many as some others, but that is little consolation to the survivors or relatives. It's a good story, told warmly, and it's true.	2005-07-24

Einstein was born at a time when his discoveries in science were possible. For three centuries the world had run on Newton's theories. Any deviation from those theories was heretical. But by the time Einstein was ready to publish his Special Theory of Relativity in 1905 there were enough pinpricks at the edges of Newton's theories so that the world was ready.  <br /> <br />Much earlier than 1905 and Einstein's theories would have been dismissed as gibberish, if indeed he hadn't suffered the same fate as Galileo and put under house arrest. As it was, Einstein became Time Magazine's Man of the Century, an honor no one else could come close to claiming.  <br /> <br />Much later and it is quite possible that Einstein would have been rounded up with the rest of the Jews and killed. Perhaps his great achievements would have been discovered by others, perhaps not yet.  <br /> <br />This book examines the culture of Germany at the end of the 1800's and how this helped to prepare the ground for him to work and produce his theories. It is a book that presents a somewhat different view of Einstein and his work.	2005-07-24

Depending on the readers point of view it will be given one of two choices:  <br /> <br />A. Right On. This author finally understands what's happening in the world and telling the truth about how America is doing wonderful things.  <br /> <br />B. Right Wing Gibberish. This author hasn't a clue. He doesn't understand how anything in the world works and doesn't see that America is doing nothing but make enemies everywhere.  <br /> <br />All in all he presents an interesting view. He says that the easiest way to understand Americans is to realize that we think of ourselves as inhabiting an island. Further, our basic goal, from before the Revolutionary War was that we wanted to be left alone on our island, and especially that we didn't want to get involved with the eternally warring great powers of Europe. There's certainly some truth to that. And this certainly continued up until the time of World War II. We didn't want to get involved with another European war until Pearl Harbor.  <br /> <br />Since then, I'm not so sure he makes such a good story. His views are consistent and make sense, but they are too complex to go into in a short review like this one. Just a couple of points: During the hostage crisis in Iran, should Carter have used the Navy to close the Strait of Hormuz to prevent the shipment of Iranian oil. And then he feels that we had to go into Iraq - for me the answer's not back on that one. Ans some of his comparisons with the foreign polities of various European countries ring with truth.  <br /> <br />Recommended, if you love it or hate it.	2005-07-24

It was written in secret during the war and put together in book form after his reporting days were over.  <br /> <br />It is written with a style of stories of personal contact with people all over the Eastern Front, combined with his own personal analysis of things like the psychology of the German troops.  <br /> <br />This is not a history, but reflects opinions, feelings, thoughts that were enough to get him confined in prison several times. It is also said that parts of the book are fictionalized. I do not know. The New York Review of Books lists it as history not fiction.  <br /> <br />True in every detail or not this is a story of 'normal' people in a particularly crazy time. His style of writing helps to bring out the crazyness of the time. Some of his descriptions get quite long, but force yourself to read them picking up the imagery. I get the feeling that he is doing his best to describe something that is undescribable.	2005-07-24

If you wear your underwear at work, that's the time when UPS is going to make a delivery. Of course I don't look nearly as good as the girl on the front cover. I've also got to say that I've never gotten rich, but I don't have a boss.<br /><br />Basically this guy knows what he is talking about, so I'm only going to comment on those areas where I think I have something to add.<br /><br />Chapter 3 is on naming your business. He gives some good advice, but I think he has the chapter backwards. For me, the most important thing is to have a good web domain name. Joe's Plumbing doesn't need a domain name, but most companies now do. He lists three companies to check on domain names. Network Solutions was the original Government set up monopoly. At that time everyone had to use them. [...] for exactly the same thing, and their customer service is great. (I have no connection with GoDaddy except being a customer of theirs.)<br /><br />Chapter 4 is on locating the business with regard to zoning. There are a lot of restrictions on operating a home business and he mentions most of them. They come down to don't cause a mess -- a lot of customers parked at your neighbors, a big flashing neon sign, big delivery trucks coming by. These things annoy neighbors. The kinds of things he talks about in Chapter 9 don't need these things, and zoning won't be a problems unless a neighbor complains.<br /><br />Most people say to form a corporation, Mr. Hupalo doesn't. I strongly agree with him, forming a corporation is expensive and probably not worth while. There is some protection under the law if you do business as a corporation, but lawyers are very experienced in getting around this shield. If you do want a corporation, you lawyer will do it for you for a few hundred dollars. For this few hundred dollars he will have his secretary type up the standardized papers he used for the last hundred corporations he did. Or you can get these same papers out of several books and file them yourself for only the filing fee.<br /><br />One last comment, chances are your business will fail, most do. But with the failure you'll learn something. Work for a while to get back on your feet and your second business will work better.

The fact that you're looking at this book at all is that you probably have some special job that needs programming and it's up to you to do it. If you have not programmed on an Apple before, or if OS X is new to you, then this is the book you need.  <br /> <br />This book is aimed at the novice/beginner programmer who doesn't know how to get into the programming environment using OS X, doesn't know what tools are available, and needs a bit of a guiding hand to get started. If you know any programming language it will be a help. If you know C it will be even more help. If you don't know either of these, this book will at least get you started up to the point where more specific documentation will take over.  <br /> <br />This book uses a hands-on approach where you type something in and your computers screen should look like the illustration in the book. That is, it's not so much of a reference book as it is a tutorial.  <br /> <br />The illustrations in this book were made using OS X 10.4 the Tiger release.

Yes, of course there were planes before 1935, and there are still ships, but Pan Am changed the concept. Now air mail and air passenger service was a reality.  <br /> <br />This huge book, obviously a labor of love lasting for many years is a masterpiece. It has literally hundreds of photographs of planes, people, and the collectable memorabilia from Pan Am's Clipper days.  <br /> <br />Each aircraft used in Pacific service is described -- there were only twelve. Three were Sikorsky S-42's, three were Martin M-130's, six were Boeing B-314's. It is remarkable that the story of twelve aircraft is still being told, romanticized (Indiana Jones movies for instance), and have instant recognition this many years later.  <br /> <br />A mystery -- in the harbor at Port Vila, Vanuatu (previously the New Hebrides) there is a sunken flying boat. The story they tell there is that this was the last pre-war flight of a Pan Am Clipper coming home after Pearl. On the takeoff run the pilot spotted a native in an outrigger canoe directly in his path, he swerved the plane and avoided the native but tore a hole in the bottom of the plane when he hit a coral head. He managed to beach the plane where the expensive parts - engines, instruments, etc. were removed. The hulk of the plane was then towed out to a deep part of the harbor and sunk.  <br /> <br />There is a plane there, I made a SCUBA dive on it. It is a seaplane. At the time I hadn't seen this book and couldn't identify what type. Now I do have the this book, it lists all of the Pan Am planes, and none of them were lost at Port Vila. I wonder what that plane really is.  <br /> <br />This book marvelously tells the story of an interesting chapter in the development of aircraft.	2005-07-23

It almost seems like this is the second volume in a mystery series. It just took an awfully long time for the second book to come out. Down through the years as one after another of the people named as Deep Throat died and no one said anything I wondered if we would ever find out. Then boom, 'I was him.'<br /><br />It's been more than thirty years. Probably half the population in this country were born since then. Nixon, Watergate, and 'All The President's Men' are from a history as far back as World War II, or World War I or maybe even the Civil War. It's from before they were born.<br /><br />I read that Bob Woodward wrote this book over thirty years, not to be published until Mark Felt died. He certainly had time to think about the situation, to carefully write his thoughts, to carefully analyze more background as to the where and why. He has done a marvelous job. This is an amazing conclusion to history that a lot of saw happening.<br /><br />Now I've got to pull out my old copy of ATPM re-read watch the movie again, and then re-read this book.	2005-07-23

Specifically Mr. Macinnis, do a short anecdote on Erwin Rommel and the poison he was given to drink as a result of the attempt on Hitler's life.

Luca Cavalli-Sforza	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Crosses the Boundry of Science and the Humanities	In recent years it has becomm possible to use DNA to trace human development. For instance the people of iceland believed themselves to be of Viking descent. DNA testing has shown that yes, the men of Iceland are of Viking descent. But the women came from England and Scotland. Apparently the Vikings stopped off to capture a few women on their way west.  <br /> <br />This little tidbit of knowledge is a mixture of multiple sciences and fields of study. The beliefs of the Icelanders has to come from a humanities perspective. The DNA evidence has to come from the hard science in the laboratory. (The supposition at the end is my own.)  <br /> <br />Dr. Cavalli-Sforza, as the title of this book says, has spent a lifetime of study spanning across many fields of study in the hard sciences and in many different areas of the humanities. This is a book that spans the globe from his offices in California and Italy to field studies in Africa and elsewhere.  <br /> <br />Written by an anthropologist and a geneticist, this book is also a good combination of crossing the fields of science and humanity.	2005-07-22

And there was a time when Woman's Wear (as it was called) was right up there with the Wall Street Journal, or Variety. Each of these is basically a specialty newspaper that covers one industry. Woman's Wear obviously covered the Rag Trade. From some time in the early 1950's to the end of the 1960's Woman's Wear was a must read. Today it is still a big paper, but nothing like it was.  <br /> <br />This book is the personal recollection of seven of the editors that made Woman's Wear what it was. They held verious positions on the paper and tell the stories with wit and a tenderness about the paper they obviously loved. Most of the stories, like the stories we remember of our own career are short with unexpected endings. The things that make a good story.

As part of Operation Double Cross the British were able to capture every German spy sent to England and either turn them or execute them.  <br /> <br />In the United States there appears to have been much less German activity. The most famous was the landing of Nazi Spies and Saboteurs by sub along the East Coast. These were cought, tried before a military tribunal, found guilty and most of them were executed.  <br /> <br />This book covers this case in great detail with an amazing number of photographs. It also covers various other spying situations, where information was being passed to Germany, sometimes by Americans. There is one case discussed where a Japanese consular official was deported.  <br /> <br />I was struck by two thoughts while reading this book:  <br /> <br />1. No cases against the Japanese living here were ever made. We put many thousands of Japanese into concentration camps, but no Germans or Italians. Was this just racially based?  <br /> <br />2. The use of military tribunals to try spies is just what President Bush is doing with the 'detainees' we are holding in Cuba. I guess the Germans during WW II were the necessary precedent.  <br /> <br />Most interesting book about a little known series of incidents.	2005-07-22

First he took several wives, but second he seemed to have a, shall we say, very close companion. ==In our homophobic world, Alexander just simply couldn't be called a queer. You certainly wouldn't want to use such derogatory language to his face, it doesn't seem to have been such a nice person either.  <br /> <br />In this book Dr. Ackerman examines the epic story of King Gilgamesh and the biblical story of King David in the view of sexual relationships and gender roles that were in place at the time. This was a time before romantic love. This was a time when the present day definitions of the proper roles for males and females shouldn't be applied.  <br /> <br />She carefully analyzes these tales from a view that she thinks fits the views of the original narrators.  <br /> <br />We think we live in a time and a culture that must have existed for all time.

What the gender roles will be in the future is impossible to say, but they will be different, just as they are different in various parts of the world now.	2005-07-22

She has definitely made the switch to digital photography, and is a master at Photoshop. But she goes far beyond this. She sometimes uses traditional art techniques to take the basic photographic digital prints to a new level of creative expression. For instance she may decide to color the image herself using traditional paints and a brush. Perhaps she prints the image on canvas and uses this only as an outline for the painting she wants to do. Perhaps she wants an old fashioned appearance, complete with aging caused discoloration or a sepia tone.  <br /> <br />There are a lot of books on using Photoshop to produce special effects. And what you can do with Photoshop is truly amazing. But what you can do with some special attachments such as infrared filters is far more.  <br /> <br />This book adds an entirely new dimension because when you get right down to it, the whole world doesn't have to be handled digitally.	2005-07-22

True, but only from the men, the Icelandic women came from Scotland and Ireland. And there is a an equally fascinating story of tracing homosexuality, boy/girl ratios, etc. through history.  <br /> <br />The second message is about the Y chromosome - what in the human species determines gender. For a long time (centuries perhaps?) the Y chromosome has been decaying. It has lost many of its genes, and become much less healthy. If this continues, it will go away. And if it goes away, there will be no men. And of course, with no men, there are no women either. Delightful book.	2005-07-21

It's fast to read, and by the time you finish you will have a good overall view of the subject. In this case that particularly includes the vocabulary. In fact knowing the jargon, as per Cisco is about half the battle in passing the test.  <br /> <br />The other half of the battle is knowing how all this stuff hangs together. I'd suggest that you read this one go through the test on the CD-ROM, and then study one of the harder books -- my own suggestion is the 'official' guide from Cisco.  <br /> <br />The reason for doing it this way is that I find the Cisco books a bit more difficult to use when trying to get an overview of the subject. They get down into the details too quickly and I get lost too quickly. Read 'For Dummies' to get the overview, then the other.	2005-07-21

The loosers of a war must an entirely different viewpoint than the victors. This is perhaps especially World War II with it's horrific memories of the holocaust.  <br /> <br />This novel explores this situation from the eyes of four children who find family photo albums showing a beautiful opera singer with \\"Italian eyes.\\" Perhaps this is the origin of their own dark eyes in a world of blue eyed kids. That the other kids taunt them would not be unexpected, kids are mean to anyone they consider an outsider. That other family members forbid the children to speak of the family's past is much more forbidding.  <br /> <br />This is not your standard assembly line mystery story. This is a story from a first rate writer, and it just happens to be his first. It is clear that this won't be his last.	2005-07-21

Writing a winning grant is not. Like any other form of specialized literature, you want your grant request to look like it's professionally done. That is, you want it to look like the rest of the stack of requests that the granting organization has in front of them. Then inside the request you have to include something that makes it so outstanding that you will get past the first reading and each subsequent review until that magic moment when you get the check. <br /> <br />The keys to doing this are well known and established, IF you've been in the grant writing/reading business. These rules are often simple, i.e. don't request from Handgun Control, Inc. for money to build a shooting range. What you need is a simple, step-by-step guide to the rules, and here it is.	2005-07-21

Why with all of their success does it take drugs for them to get through their lives? And in the news you don't hear about followups. What happens to these people after they get out of their court ordered treatment (or jail)?  <br /> <br />In this book the authors have managed to get an extraordinary collection of people to talk about their lives under drugs and how they were able to beat their habbit. In each case it was clearly a struggle, it was not easy, but they managed.  <br /> <br />I say the collection of people is extraordinary because it contains far more than just the musicians that seem to get all the press. It includes sports figures, writers, comedians, and actors. The stories leave me with a feeling of both sadness and hope. That these people can not only accomplish what they did but that they are now will to share their experiences with the rest of us speaks great things about them.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-07-21

You can read it pretty quickly, it starts out quite simply and builds slowly. You don't think you're getting as much information as you are until you've finished.  <br /> <br />Again as usual, this book is written by a couple of people who combine personal experience with a casual relaxed writing style. (For what it's worth, I've tried writing like this and it isn't easy.)  <br /> <br />Most of us thinking about investment clubs already have some investing experience and think that we might be able to teach the club a lot. Most of us learn that the other people in the club can teach us a lot. Investment clubs attract the advanced amateur who bring specialized knowledge, their own experience, and above all enough questions that you might have forgotten to ask to make it well worth your while.  <br /> <br />Great Way to Get Started.	2005-07-21

It is a world that will exist only in the mind of the audience, but it is a world none the less. He has to start with some kind of image of the space he is creating along with the emotions that he has to make the audience feel. To do this the author must look at the conflicting ideas inside his head and bring them out to mere words on that piece of paper.  <br /> <br />Susan Zeder is the head of the playwriting program at the University of Texas at Austin. Jim Hancock is a teacher of acting and movement. Over many years they have jointly developed their approach to teaching acting. This book summarizes their efforts. It combines an array of psychophysical and theatrical approaches to playwriting that is unique.  <br /> <br />Following a series of short exercises, this book will enlighten and entertain while uncovering ways to invigorate your writing from within.	2005-07-21

Roosevelt would send a trusted aid out on a mission once in a while, but he esentially ran the War by himself. Truman wasn't even aware of the Atomic Bomb project until after Roosevelt's death. Stalin and Churchill were aware, but not Truman.  <br /> <br />It makes good sense that Truman then created the National Security Council, and it's no surprise that he included the vice president as a member. It's also not much of a surprise that also created by the same legislation the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Central Intelligence Agency. After all the interservice rivalries Army vs. Navy and FBI vs. OSS during World War II were pathetic.  <br /> <br />In this exhaustive history of the NSC Mr. Rothkopf discusses the working relationship between the President and the NSC since its birth. As you would expect, the organization has waxed and waned depending on the individuals involved. A major influence on the NSC from the late sixties through about 1990 has been Henry Kissinger whose influence has extended far beyond his actual time in office.  <br /> <br />The conclusion I reach after reading this book is that the NSC isn't perfect, what is, but it's a hell of a lot better than the way Roosevelt did it. This book is a good introduction to how one rather obscure part of our Government works.	2005-07-20

At at least $200 million each, it is certainly the most expensive. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, is it needed?  <br /> <br />The plane that eventually became the F/A-22 began as a planned replacement for the F-15 and F-16 as they were reaching the end of their useful lives. The thinking about the plane began as early as 1969. Now in 2005 they are being delivered to the Air Force.  <br /> <br />This is a beautiful book that starts with the early thinking, goes through the competition, initial testing, early production troubles, engine development, everything and in great detail. There's a bit about the competing F-23 fighter, which also looks like it would have been a pretty good bird.  <br /> <br />There are some artist's concepts of a proposed F/B-22 bomber version and a comment that Northrop was dusting off their F-23 design to make it a bomber. A bomber like this might finally enable the Air Force to have a self-defending bomber like they thought they had with the B-17.  <br /> <br />Do we need the F/A-22? -- I think that yes, we probably do. The United States professes to be a peaceful nation, but we go to war a lot. And if we do, I'd want our warfighters to have the best possible equipment. For at least the next twenty years, that's the F/A-22.	2005-07-20

Most of us then stumble our way through the whole dating process, the first introductions to sex with a lot of hear-say information.  <br /> <br />Finally, here's a book, not for dumb people, but for people who just don't have the knowledge they need quite yet.

Then I turned to the first chapter. It's called Advertising: The Last Choice in Marketing. And it was dead on right -- To be sure there is a place for advertising, Pepsi up against Coke has no choice (which isn't to say that they do it well). They have no choice because they can't do the kinds of things this book talks about. They can't produce a new product -- Remember New Coke?  <br /> <br />In any case, this book isn't about Coke, it's about marketing a small business or service. That means you need to market locally. Effectively you can't advertise. I was recently involved in promoting a play for a local community theater. We had posters all over town, both supermarkets, half the business windows on main street, three articles in our local paper plus announcements every issue in their Community Calendar, there was a twenty minute interview program on the local radio station -- all the kinds of things this book talks about. The play was a great success, both performances sold out, standing ovations for the performers. Afterwards a great number of people came up and said, \\"I heard you put on a play, I didn't know anything about it, tell me about it when you do another.\\" What possible good would advertising do?  <br /> <br />If I had run a few thousand dollars of advertising do you think any of these people would have noticed? If they didn't read the articles, see the calendar or tune in the radio. What else could I have done? <br /> <br />Marketing now is a different matter. We marketed, it worked. We paid very little money out. Did we do everything the book said? No. We didn't do internet for instance. This was a local play to a local audience in the back room of a local restaurant. The book talks about the internet. And yes, I have to agree the internet is excellent for some kinds of marketing, not for every situation. A small business with a specialty product for which you couldn't possibly find enough customers in a local community couldn't do better than the net. Example -- crystal radio kit. You might could sell one in our little town. You could make a business of selling them world wide.  <br /> <br />Great book. If you're just starting out or need to improve marketing the ideas expressed here can be agreat help.	2005-07-20

There are all kinds of 'ceilings' imposed on minorities, be they women, native Americans African-Americans, or as described in this book Asian.  <br /> <br />This book, obviously about Asians looks at the situation and examines not only the situation as it exists, but then attempts to find out why this situation exists. This includes an analysis of the mental attitude of the Asian worker who is coming from a different culture that teaches a different standard of behavior.  <br /> <br />This book is written by an Asian woman who is a career coach or human resources consultant to Fortune 500 companies. Her book offers some advice aimed at the Asian worker that might help to point out ways that an individual might use to change certain cultural behavior patterns. This includes such points as speaking out, participating in a conversation may be more important than the study hard skills learned when the goal was to make good grades.	2005-07-20

It's a small magazine with limited circulation, largely to professionals in the area. Often though it publishes articles dealing with areas of interest to us amateurs. These articles might include more information that has just become available on the German Enigma of World War II, or the article in this book on code breaking by the Vatican.  <br /> <br />It now appears pretty generally accepted that the Japanese codes that had been broken did not provide any definitive information as to the attack on Pearl Harbour. There is new information however about the receipt of some messages sent in other non-broken codes that would have directly pointed to Pearl as the target. Unfortunately these codes were not broken until after the war. There is enough confusion about these messages that people are still not convinced of its truth. But there are two articles on the subject in this book, one taking each side.  <br /> <br />Reading Cryptologia to pull out the interesting article would be a task. Artech House, the publisher of this book has managed to pull together what amounts to the editorial board of Cryptologia to put this book together. It follows the supurb book - The German Enigma Cipher Machine. These books seem expensive, but they are not printed in high volume and the contain information not available anywhere else. I recommend buying them before they go out of print.  <br /> <br />Now I'd like to put in a request to these authors and publishers. Do a book on Russian/Soviet codes and code breaking. Success in code breaking seem to come with capabilities in music, mathematics, and chess -- skills at which the Russians seem to excell. And of course there's the Venona project.  <br /> <br />Regardless, please keep these books coming.	2005-07-19

In the book he covers every aspect from the harvesting of the grapes by Mexican migrant farm workers to the final steps of trying to get a superior rating from the critical tasters at Wine Spectator magazine.  <br /> <br />More than the simple story of the production of a single wine, this is really an insight into the California wine industry. It's a huge industry, yet at the same time is is also somewhat of an art form. Each bottle of premium wine is produced to be unique, to be the best possible drink that can be made from that batch of grapes. And after it's produced, how do you tell if this is the best or not. You read the reviews with their words of 'a hint of sour peppermint,' or whatever and wonder even what they mean. What they mean, of course, is that the writer had to struggle to come up with something to say, and that something makes or breaks a wine.	2005-07-19

The scan is looking for genes that prescribe a likelyhood of future diseases. Each of the major diseases that affect men are analyzed to see what his future holds. This is combined with some serious thinking about the implications of knowing that you are pre-disposed to have cancer, Alzheimers, Huntington's Disease or something else that is pretty nasty.  <br /> <br />In addition the book reports on a series of discussions with leading researchers at the forefront of knowledge about DNA. This gives an up to date view of the state of the art as it exists today.  <br /> <br />This is a fascinating book to explain a science that will have impact on us all. As I read it though, I was almost constantly reminded of the situation in Botswanna where the average life span is expected to drop to 27 years by the year 2010 because of AIDS.

It shows a young, attractive, stately, elegant lady. And when I saw the title was Martha Washington I had to realize that I had always thought of her as old, the First Mother of the country so to speak.  <br /> <br />Of course Martha Washington wasn't always old. She married when she was 18 and had two children by her first husband. She was also wealthy, strong-minded, and seems to have had a delightful, intelligent personality.  <br /> <br />After she married George Washington, she was for forty one years her husband's beloved partner and the mainstay of his stressful life. She set the standard for how first ladies should act in trying to balance the public and private parts of her life. As George set the image for the Presidency, Martha created the rule of the First Lady.  <br /> <br />This is one of the most interesting biographies in recent years. It is extensively researched and well written, but it also covers a subject that has gotten inadequate attention from biographers down through the years.  <br /> <br />The picture on the cover -- It is new.

This is an introductory book that basically tells you the general rules of buying things at probate. While the introduction and the back cover talk about buying all kinds of things at probate, the bulk of the book is on buying real estate.  <br /> <br />Real estate, as Mr. Banks puts it, is the 'Big Nuggets' of the investing world, especially if you are thinking of commercial property. When you buy something at the probate auction you are expected to come up with the cash or a cashiers check within minutes. You don't have time to go looking for a lender. He says find a rich friend if you don't have the money or credit yourself -- good luck. Why wouldn't the rich friend just pay you a finders fee and take the investment himself.  <br /> <br />Most places have a person in charge of selling estate property. Here in the county where I live that office is called the Public Administrator. They put out an auction list periodically that lists the personal property they have for sale -- computers, guns, camera, jewelry, etc. You might want to call your county clerks office and try to find such a department where you live.  <br /> <br />Investing in real estate obtained via probate is fine, but it's not quite as competition free as Mr. Banks implies. Hint: go watch an auction before you decide to go into the business.  <br /> <br />This is a good introductory book. It will give you the broad outlines, it's up to you to make it into a real business.	2005-07-18

I wanted two books. One book would look at all the digital cameras that are avaiable and tell me which one to buy. I found this information in Consumers Report.  <br /> <br />But beyond that, I had a bunch of questions as to what the various features and specifications really mean, and what are the differences in taking digital vs. film pictures. From my experience with film photography I knew that I wanted a single lens camers. I didn't want to carry around a bunch of lenses. And the single lens needed to be a zoom with the ability to focus up close for macro work. <br /> <br />This book answered the questions I had, and many more that I didn't even know I had. It covers the digital zoom cameras on a conceptual basis, it does not pick out a particular brand. But it talks about zoom lenses. It talks about macro lens adapters (I need to try out the particular camera I ordered before making decisions about what, if anything, I need in this area). More important it talked about the differences in film and digital in areas like color sensitivity, and the digital equivalents of the ISO film speeds. Like I said, it talks about things that I never thought to ask.  <br /> <br />The few bucks that this book costs will be well paid back in either choosing the right camera or in getting better pictures.	2005-07-18

Most of the birds are no longer in use, but some are still flying and will be flying on the 50th anniversary of the plane. It began as an all-weather fleet defense interceptor for the US Navy, but will be remembered most as the mainstay of the Air Force operations in Vietnam.  <br /> <br />This book is the exhaustively researched records of what happened to each of the planes that were built. It includes the McDonnell build information and more on the planes lives. Most of the data is in tabular form, you can't put too much about each of the 5,000 planes in only 360 pages.  <br /> <br />And of the 360 pages, about sixty of them are beautiful four color photographs showing more imaginative paint jobs than you can imagine. <br /> <br />This book is going to remain the definitive report on the construction and operational use of the F-4.	2005-07-18

The pointy haired managers are all too common. This book is on solving that problem.  <br /> <br />People in most companies are made to feel that their contribution, their importance to the company is just about nil. Experience has shown most of us that devotion to the company is not reciprocated. We think we are doing well, we think we are doing what the company wants. And we are on the lay off list.  <br /> <br />The difference here is communications within the company. Are we really pushing in the direction that the company wants to go, do we understand what the company is expecting of us. Most of us care, most of us don't feel that the company cares.  <br /> <br />This book talks about inter company communications and how management can most effectively communicate their views to employees. This includes the three key points of identifying and tailoring your messages for maximum effectiveness, understanding and using various communications tools to get as much understanding out of your messages as possible, and most important, measuring the effeciveness of your messages.  <br /> <br />This book presents internal communications in a new but easy to understand light.	2005-07-18

Not true here. Perhaps the answer is to create different pen names and then you get to write an entirely different genre of books with whole new types of characters in whole new situations.  <br /> <br />This book is a sort of combination of high tech thriller (DNA, forensic genealogy) with old fashioned detective work. In this case, the nominal task is to research a family. And if you thought your family was dysfunctional, wait until you see this one. It helps to make a really messy family if it involves murder, illegitimate children and ties to crime.  <br /> <br />And it makes researching ancestry more interesting if there are still family members practicing these assorted skills and aren't particularly interested in having the family history brought up.  <br /> <br />The ties to ancesters make interesting points. As she says, 'your ancestors were people too. Their lives weren't lived just to be certain that YOU someday would be born. If it would upset you to find out that the people whose genes you carry weren't saints, don't go asking questions.'  <br /> <br />An interesting book set in the American southwest.	2005-07-18

It was a surprise to find that they were being met with MIG-15's. The not-quite-ready F-86 was rushed over to meet the challenge, and meet it it did.<br /><br />Overall the American pilots achieved a 8 to 1 kill ratio. (Subsequent information from the Soviet Union says that up against the few Russian pilots that were volunteers to the North Korean Air Force held the Americans to about a one to one ratio.) The plane was obviously a great improvement over what went before, and the training of the pilots significantly better.<br /><br />This book is the story of the F-86's that flew in Korea. It is probably going to remain as the definitive book on the subject. The book depends a lot on conversations with men who flew the planes, and as this was now over fifty years ago, the number of remaining pilots is rapidly declining.<br /><br />This book is the complete history of the Sabers, including the down sides such points as inadequate armaments (six .50 calibers) and friendly fire. It of course also includes the good side, with the story of all the Aces that came out of the war.	2005-07-18

In Harmony they don't have the Harry Potter kind of magic, they don't have the gruesome murders most foul. In Harmony they have a bunch of people that live in, well, not exactly harmony. They have the usual dysfunctional people struggling along as best they can and usually making it through another year.  <br /> <br />With each year the characters of the residents of Harmony get better defined. Some of them we want to go join for dinner, at McDonald's of course. Some of course we'd just as soon leave behind.  <br /> <br />A sample of the dialog:  <br /> <br />Sam read aloud from the twenty-five years ago this week column in the paper: \\"Sam Gardner ... will receive a fifty-dollar schlorship to the college of his choice and a shoe-care kit, compliments of Morrison's Menswear.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Do you still have it?\\"  <br /> <br />\\"The shoe-care kit?\\"  <br /> <br />\\"No, the fifty dollars.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Spent it a long time ago,\\" Sam reported.  <br /> <br />\\"Rats.

On the other hand, if you're like me, you really have no choice, this is just something you have to do. I started my first one while in college. I had no idea of the problems that I would face, and sure enough it failed within a few months.  <br /> <br />My second business lasted a little longer, my third for about ten years. Then it got cought in a classic inventory squeeze and boom it was gone too. When your business fails, you have to go to work for someone else. Hopefully you have learned something from the failure, and the next one works better. My current little business has paid me a living for some years, shows no signs of failing and is a hell of a lot more fun than having a boss.  <br /> <br />Why do I say all this, it's because if I had known what was printed in this book when I was first getting started I could have done a lot of things differently, a lot of things better, and understood a lot more about what I was doing in general.  <br /> <br />This book is basically a full course in running a small business. It's better than what you'd get in college (I know I have an MBA.) because colleges teach you how to be mid-level management in large companies and in a small business all the rules are really different.  <br /> <br />This is a wonderful book. Open it to just about any page and you'll find something that will help you. Note especially the opening paragraph, with everything you have here, you'll still need some good old-fashioned luck. But the rest of the book will teach you that you often make your own luck.	2005-07-15

As the title says, it covers the frontier as it moved from the original colonies to the west.  <br /> <br />The first story takes place on July 30, 1609 when a fellow killed a captured Iroquois with a single shot from an arquebus. From there it goes on to to the mid 1800's ending with the first battle of the Mexican War. ==The treatment that the book gives these guns is a combination of technical, especially as this was the time of great improvements from the matchlock of 1609 to Colt's revolvers, and of the history of their use such as that by Walker which resulted in the definition of the Walker Colt. It is illustrated with 58 line drawings that show both the weapons and the people who used them.  <br /> <br />This book covers an area that has largely been ignored in other books. It is well written and recommended for readers with this interest.	2005-07-15

Some of these are merely reporting on the city of this name in Brazil. Most of them however relate to the story of a crashed UFO. The report is that in April, 1997 a UFO crashed in the town.  <br /> <br />This book consists of research conducted in Varginha by the author. He personally interviewed most of the known witnesses and presents this book as a summary of everything that is known about the incident.  <br /> <br />As with the situation in Roswell, the incident occurred, and the military responded. The aliens that were captured were taken away by the military and have not been seen since. Nor is there any physical evidence in the hands of people outside the military that would definitely point to an extraterrestrial origin. ==Unfortunately we are left with a matter of faith. Those who believe in UFO's will remain convinced, those who do not will merely look at like any other story.  <br /> <br />Dr. Leir is a podiatrist who has published other books in the general area of UFOlogy.	2005-07-15

This book talked about a highly modified B-52 that went on a mission over the Soviet Union. This theme of taking existing products or products that are on the drawing board and using this technology as a central part of the theme has continued through all of his books.  <br /> <br />In this book, Mr. Brown has made the necessary transition from having the Soviet Union as an adversary to the seemingly unlimited world of terrorists (of course back then the Soviets were also thought of as being unlimited).  <br /> <br />The book starts with an entirely reasonable possibility, the explosion of a nuke at an oil refinery. Enter Army Major Jason Richter, his new hero (not bad for an Air Force guy to have an Army guy as the hero). Walking through the scene of the attack in an CID Exoskeleton (a real device being worked on by the Army) he is just in time to save the beautiful newscaster.  <br /> <br />As you can see, this is vintage Dale Brown.

Although it is kind of hard to find between the ranting and raving, I think Mr. Taibbi has the American presidential campaign pretty well understood.  <br /> <br />He repeatedly attempts to ask hard questions of the various candidates. The candidates do a supurb job of not answering in any meaningful fashion. After all if they say anything serious it is bound to offend someone.  <br /> <br />He lambasts his fellow reporters for being too cozy with the candidates. But if they say anything bad about the candidate they would get kicked off the campaign plane or out of the White House press pool. Hey man, they want to keep their jobs.  <br /> <br />He attacks both parties, but Bush harder. He says that he would prefer Count Dracula over Bush. That lets you know his political views (actually far left of any Democrat). He views both parties as tweedledee/tweedledum. And they are, they have to be to win an election.  <br /> <br />His real views is that the American political system doesn't provide for needed change, as he views needed change. It makes me think of the Churchill quotation, 'Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those others that have been tried.'	2005-07-14

That means that instead of reading 528 pages you only need to read about 70. But, you may really, really need that 70 pages. The reason for this is that the book covers seven of the most common databases: IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, PostGreSQL, SQL Server, SyBase, Informix. These programs are so different that what applies to one does not generally apply to the others.  <br /> <br />Each section of the book covers one of the databases. It usually begins with some history of both the database and attacks on it. For instance the Slammer worm compromised more than 75,000 SQL Server databases within ten minutes of its release in January 2003.  <br /> <br />After that there is a discussion on the database, its architecture, how it handles things like authentication and so on.  <br /> <br />Finally it goes into how to defend the database against attack. This includes information on how to remove unncecessary features and services that might serve as gateways to attacks, and talks about how to use the databases own internal security systems to their maximum effectiveness.  <br /> <br />As I said, you really need the 70 or so pages that refer to your own database.  <br /> <br />PS - What's the most secure database - PostGreSQL, and it goes into why.	2005-07-14

This is the book that nearly any business manager from marketing, to engineering, to sales, should read.   <br /> <br />The first time I travelled to Scandinavia I was struck with the simple elements of design that they do so much better than we do in this country. Simple things like the design of hotel doors, no more expensive than what we do here, just better.  <br /> <br />And the sub-title, 'why there are no locks on the bathrobe doors in the Hotel Louis XIV' -that's a great story, it makes such eminent sense.

Perhaps you have to do it because of some kind of internal drive that simply won't accept anything else. Perhaps you have to do it because you're tired of working for someone else, or tired of getting laid off because the owners kid got your job.  <br /> <br />Once you make the decision to get started, there are a couple of things to remember:  <br /> <br />One is that the only thing you have to sell is your time. Therefore don't waste time on trivia, that is, if you can find out what just what constitutes trivia. You obviously have to take time to set up an office, get the computer working, all that kind of stuff. But you don't have time to paint the house, wash the car during business hours, etc.  <br /> <br />Two is that you have to treat this seriously as a business. Begin doing real accounting, so that your relationship with the IRS can remain smooth - remember they are your partner in this venture.  <br /> <br />Three specialize in something. You may be the greatest thing in web design (a popular new business area), or TV ad production. Play to your strengths, don't try to be all things to all people.  <br /> <br />Four, take advantage of the services offered by things like the Small Business Councils, often funded by your state university.  <br /> <br />Realize that it's going to be difficult and plan for Murphy to screw things up, for it to cost more than you expect.  <br /> <br />This book covers many of these areas, but just keep these points in mind as you read the book.

The physical are minimal, low impact, exercises that lead you to believe that this is intended for a somewhat older audience. The mental exercises are not unlike those on I.Q. tests where you do problems in math, complete sequences, and so on.  <br /> <br />As you might expect, these exercises are intended to be maintained on a regular basis for the rest of your life, or at least as long as you want to remember things and keep your body alive.  <br /> <br />As a doctor, he can't resist talking about the drugs that are available to assist the aging population. Some of these are more in the area of diet supplements, some are prescription only.  <br /> <br />All in all, this is not unlike the programs advocated by many physicians, just a bit more about mental agility than most.

This is the first (but almost certainly not the last) of the official histories of the recent war with Iraq. It is written by the marine officer in charge of the marine history unit in Iraq. It combines his own observations with those of his team and with the official reports produced by each of the major marine units in the field.  <br /> <br />This book provides the first comprehensive story of the marines in Iraq. It begins with the run-up to war in 2002 and continues through 2003 as the commanders analyze the lessons learned in this war and the departure of the last Marine in the fall 0f 2003. There is only a hint that the Marines would be returning in 2004.  <br /> <br />These will be other, bigger, more complete official histories that come out of this war. This book is the first, and probably will form the framework that will be used by the later historians.  <br /> <br />This book is also written with a view to its being read by the general public.

If you come from even the normal dysfunctional modern family, to get assigned as the author did to one of the hell hole areas in New York City has to be one scary damn way to get started on a career.  <br /> <br />Of all the books I've read on big city cops, this is the one most blatent, grim (how can people life this way), hard to vizualize and downright scary. It is also the one that confess, if you will, the lengths that the cops will go to in order to get someone off the street.  <br /> <br />This book says that the police, or at least this individual think little of being the judge and jury combined together to put people away. This gives me two real thoughts: one is that I hope they don't decide to come after me, and second, if the same rules are being applied to death sentences, our whole country is in trouble.  <br /> <br />Mr. Cea believes that the laws give criminals more rights than the police and you have to take that advantage back. If this is the way the whole criminal justice system is working.... This is an imposing book, well worth reading, but scary.	2005-07-13

Like a lot of others in America, he began in a poor family having to work at an early age - but he got a job at the local airport (sweeping the hanger, mowing the yard) and learned to fly. And he learned well. Well enough to be a Navy test pilot flying the latest and greatest Navy planes as they were being developed. And from there he literally went to the moon, the third man to walk on the moon. Reading about his life is quite interesting.  <br /> <br />Reading about his dreams is even better. He was not just a flyboy driving the plane around. He was able to understand where space science might take us. After his Navy/NASA career he started four separate companies to privitize going into space. His vision included much of what has happened since, and much that is still to come.  <br /> <br />One think I believe you can say about Pete Conrad, he lived life to the fullest he could.  <br /> <br />His was a time when things were happening, before NASA became so bureaucratic, a time when the public looked forward to what was happening, where we were going. He had quite a ride.	2005-07-13

Dr. Ostler (who speaks 18 languages) has written a view of world history based not on where they live but of the languages they speak.  <br /> <br />He writes not only of the major languages (like the English I'm using to write this -- English, tied with Spanish as the second most popular language), but of languages long dead. He is able to trace the evolution of languages from common bases or roots to the variations that people are using today.  <br /> <br />He further talks about what makes a language grow (birth rate, military/governmental control, religion). And he talks about conflicts that arise when incoming languages (Spanish in the case of the U.S.) define a minority of the people in a community.  <br /> <br />By the way, if you hadn't guessed, the number one language in the world is Chinese -- 900 million speakers as opposed to 300 million for English and Spanish. Arabic is about 200 million, but like Hebrew is the language of a particular religion.  <br /> <br />This is a fascinating book, made interesting by the light hearted writing style that relates the language being discussed to the rest of the world.	2005-07-09

The book is based on the International Game Developers Association Curiculum Framework.  <br /> <br />Steve Rabin, the editor of the book is a ten year vet in the game industry, and is currently a senior software engineer at Nintendo. He contacted twenty seven of the world's leading game developers, programmers, and designers to do chapters on their specialty. These are not professional writers, but are actively engaged in and work for some of the best known companies in the gaming business.  <br /> <br />Game programming is nothing without movement, so the book almost had to contain a CD. On the CD are all the animations, documents, source code, demos, etc that are referenced in the chapters. In addition are the actual images being discussed in the text. Finally there is a PowerPoint presentation that complement each chapter.  <br /> <br />This is perhaps the most complete book on gaming development that exists.	2005-07-08

Perhaps the most successful of these were the Free French under de Gaulle, which fought along side American and British forces during the invasion of France. Another famous group was the Polish pilots in the RAF during the Battle of Britain.  <br /> <br />In the Cold War one notable exile army was the Cuban Exiles and the infamous Bay of Pigs operation. Other exile armies abounded in Africa during the numerous wars that have occurred since colonial departures.  <br /> <br />This book is a series of articles, each by an expert in their particular area, on the history of these Exile Armies. Some, like the French mentioned earlier were quite successful. Others like the Independent Czechoslovak Brigade were neither very successful in battle or in returning to their homeland.  <br /> <br />This is a most interesting area of history that has been largely ignored. This book is a welcome addition to a World War II or Cold War library.	2005-07-08

All the more tragic because the victums have been the weakest members of society: women, children, the elderly.  <br /> <br />This book talks about one such case where some 191,000 people were rounded up one night and were moved some 4,000 miles across the Soviet Union. For years no one knew why Stalin ordered this. The stated reason was for collaboration with the Germans. But this seemed unlikely. Only with the collapse of the Soviet Union has the information come about that they might have interferred with one of Stalin's plans to attack Turkey.  <br /> <br />This book is a well researched story of the movement as forced by the Government, and the gradual return of many of the remaining people to their ancestral homeland.	2005-07-08

GoLive is an interesting package that presents quite a different view to the developer than more traditional packages.  <br /> <br />This is a Hints and Tips books. As such it is probably the second book you should read on GoLive. It doesn't give you a 'Get Started' type tutorial, it starts out with 'If you don't like the home screen, here is how to change it.'  <br /> <br />All in all, there are 250 Tips and Tricks. I found the most useful to be the Third-Party Actions and Extensions. In this area are extensions like Adding PayPal eCommerce (Free, a very good price, but of course you pay later in commissions), a Secure Shopping Cart (various prices) and a bunch of utility packages that are free to nominally priced. This was the most useful because I wasn't aware that some of these add-ins were even available.  <br /> <br />At any level from beginner to pro, if you read this book you'll get an idea or two well worth the cost of the book.	2005-07-08

It's the official book from Adobe press, the official training workbook from Adobe Systems, it's even written by Adobe (well ... people at Adobe). This new edition is printed in full color, a great improvement over earlier books that were mostly black and white with a small section of full color pages.  <br /> <br />Color is important in Illustrator because a very small percentage of the work you'll be doing is in black and white. If the book is telling you something about color and illustrating it in black and white, it's hard to know what they are talking about.  <br /> <br />This book has fifteen lessons that you can complete very quickly if you know what they are talking about but take longer if you're a complete beginner. The first lesson starts out with a simulated advertisement and gets you started making changes to the ad. This approach is helpful in remembering what the various tools you've used really do. Primarily in tutorial style, this book is a supplement to the reference type documentation supplied with Illustrator. It provides a good way to get started and to have a complete presentation with logical flow from start to finish.  <br /> <br />The CD supplied with the book contains illustrations from the lessons, a collection of fonts, and other materials.  <br /> <br />All in all, this book is well written, simple to follow, tells you enough to become if not a true expert, at least an advanced intermediate user.

In talking about Elizabeth I's favorite drink: spices, syrup, grape wine and honey, \\"a sickly-sweet concoction that would not appeal to the un-Tudored palates of modern Chablis drinkers.\\" \\"un-Tudored,\\" anyone who can write like that deserves to be read.  <br /> <br />The next chapter talks about what happens to any bacterium that happens to fall into honey. The highly concentrated sugars in the honey pull the water out of the bacterium. The bacterium then shrink up and die. The ancients, applied honey to wounds, they didn't get infected and they healed faster. Honey impregnated bandages are available in Europe, Australia and New Zeeland (but not in the U.S. - probably no way to get honey through the approval cycle) but worth a try next time you get a cut.  <br /> <br />Finally, the book concludes with an Afterword, which is entitled 'A Letter to the Hive.' It's a copy of what might be a letter to the bees, sent 'care of the hive.' It says, thanks and we love you.  <br /> <br />Delightful reading along with a great mass of information.	2005-07-07

For every glow of a candle such as Nelson Mandela, there are hundreds of dark corners. African governments are, almost without exception corrupt, filled with politicians out mainly to protect their own position and to line their own pockets for the time when they may have to leave the country. Foreign aid supports most of the governments, and it appears that most of the money is totally wasted. Popular fund raising activities such as the musical efforts Live Aid, are but a drop in the ocean of dispair.  <br /> <br />This book basically covers the history of Africa since the end of the days of colonial empire. It has not been a pretty picture. Wars, despotic leaders, tribal genocides have all been a legacy of European departure.  <br /> <br />Some critics of the book question the overall pessimism of Mr. Meredith. I think he is too optimistic. For instance he speaks highly of the government in South Africa. And in many ways he is right. The willingness of the whites to turn over power to the black ANC was remarkable. Perhaps even more so was the willingness of Nelson Mandela to voluntarily leave office. But now Mbeki is in office, he who says that it isn't clear that the HIV causes AIDS, he who praises Mugabe, will he leave office willingly? Will he yield to the more strident anti-whites to begin land forclosures, a la Mugabe. You can't borrow money to buy a farm now because the banks are afraid of confiscation.  <br /> <br />Then there is AIDS. With 10% of the world's population, Africa has 70% of the known AIDS cases. In 2010 the average life expectancy in Botswanna (one of the mroe civilized countries) is expected to be 27 years. And this pandemic is still in its infancy.  <br /> <br />Africa is not a pretty scene. The happy carefree life of the native in the old movie The Gods Must Be Crazy is gone, if it ever existed, just like the actor who recently died of multiple drug resistant TB.  <br /> <br />A sad book. Unfortunately all tootrue.	2005-07-07

As you can tell from the title, this is not exactly an unbiased look at the Social Security situation. I read what he says, and find it very interesting. As he says, the literature regarding social security reform is copious, complex, and abstruse. Yep, I gotta agree with that. This book takes the stand that the Bush plan is fradulent, partisan, favors the rich, etc. etc.  <br /> <br />The book is well worth reading to try to understand what is really happening. On the other hand, it is so strident in its attack on Bush that I'm not so sure just what's going on.  <br /> <br />I listened to Bush make the pitch for allowing some part of the amount we pay into Social Security be used for investment in the private sector. This seems to work all right in other countries such as Japan. He also said that he would welcome working with the Democrats in Congress to come up with a plan that would be acceptable to everyone.  <br /> <br />So far I'm only seeing attacks like this one with no alternative plans being offered by the Democrats. Mr. Hiltzik says that only minor changes are necessary, what he considers minor may not be so minor when viewed by the Republicans (they include raising taxes). Let's hear these from the opposition in Congress. But it appears that they would rather just attack than really work on the problem.  <br /> <br />It looks like it's going to be a long argument.	2005-07-07

The maritime laws have been developed over centuries of agreements between countries. The cruise ship operators have very carefully looked at the overall situation with a view to minimizing their costs.  <br /> <br />The ships are built in shipyards where government subsidies reduce the cost of building the ships. If the government of France wants to tax its citizens to pay part of the cost of building the ships, why should the cruise companies object.  <br /> <br />The ships are licensed in countries offering \\"Flags of Convenience.\\" If it costs a few thousand dollars to 'flag' the ship as Liberian, and a few hundred times that to flag it as American, well, that's a pretty easy decision as well.  <br /> <br />And if it's a foreign ship, then it doesn't have to abide by U.S. minimum wage laws, safety requirements, etc. The dish washer can be any nationality that you can hire at the lowest possible price.  <br /> <br />Sure the U.S. politicians can get involved, pass a law about ships leaving and returning to the same port, i.e. if you leave from Miami and return to Miami then the ship must be U.S. flagged, U.S. crewed, U.S. polution law compliant, etc.  <br /> <br />This though would dramatically raise the cost of a cruise, and people wouldn't like that. It might also mean that the cruise would start/end in Nassau or some place like that.  <br /> <br />It's fascinating to see what the cruise ship companies have done to create the idea of an ocean voyage that goes basically nowhere. It makes you wonder if cruises between New York and London wouldn't make sense. Then we could redo the kind of travel that the airlines put out of business back in the '50's. Hey, the SS United States is (last I heard) tied up in Philadelphia and is probably for sale. <br /> <br />Of course cruising the North Atlantic in winter is different than the Caribbean.	2005-07-07

A contemporary of and sometimes associate of Edison, he held a great many pivital patents in the area. Largely ignored during his lifetime, many of his inventions were used by other companies (Westinghouse, Edison, GE, Marconi) without acknowledgement or payment to Tesla. As a result Tesla died alone and broke. Eight months after his death the Supreme Court reviewed his earlier radio patents and ruled that he had indeed been the basic inventer of radio, not Marconi as is still commonly believed.  <br /> <br />Tesla is also remembered as a \\"way out\\" thinker. He worked for years on the transmission of power through the air rather than using wires - it didn't work. He was trying to build a death ray, the papers of which are held in a classified library at a U.S. defense research agency and are accessible only to members of the intelligence community - no one knows why they remain so closely guarded sixty years later.  <br /> <br />Tesla is a person who should be remembered better. This book is a welcome addition to the bookshelf.	2005-07-07

They have selected these colleges because of national recognition, geographic diversity, and sometimes just because they like something about the school.  <br /> <br />And this makes sense. If you are interested in the Southern Utah University in Cedar City, Utah (good Shakespeare department); the Naval Academy at Annapolis (you know what they stress); or Oral Roberts University - you probably know enough about the school to makie your own choice.  They aren't listed here.  <br /> <br />This is a general guide, it is based mostly on information supplied by the schools themselves so obviously it presents all of the schools in a favorable light. The standard format of each listing includes: academics, campus setting, student body, financial aid, housing, food, social life, extracurricular activities.  <br /> <br />Only six foreign schools (4 Canada, 2 British) are included. I'd have liked to see some more as some excellect opportunities exist for low cost, high quality education abroad. Some schools in Australia, even the University of the South Pacific in Fiji (great setting & $400 per year dorm room with meals), would be interesting to consider.

When a writer has a popular series novel going it's difficult to look at a book that's out of the series without some prejudice. After all, we know the characters in Big Stone Gap. They've become our friends. We want to know what's happening to them lately.  <br /> <br />Yes, I know Ms. Trigiani must be needing a break from the trials of life in West Virginia. But here we are being asked to accept a new set of characters that don't have the same characteristics as those in Big Stone Gap. These people even live in, yuck, New Jersey.  <br /> <br />OK, we'll just have to pretend that Iva Lou Wade (in her mind the sexiest woman alive), who drives the book mobile to Big Stone Gap brought us this book and wants us to read it while we wait on the next installment from Big Stone Gap.  <br /> <br />Now you've got to say that even if these aren't the same characters we've come to know and love, can we put up with them, even like them. Yes, we can put up with them, some of them we can even like. And the basic story of remodelling the church is pretty entertaining.  <br /> <br />All in all, I guess I have to admit it's a pretty good book. It's enough to give you a fix while you wait for the next installment from Big Stone Gap. If it weren't for Big Stone Gap, it'd be a five star book. I guess then you've got to say that it's still a five star book.	2005-07-07

The basic plot is fairly simple, take a bunch of recent law school grads and put them in a how powered big time law firm and watch what happens. The real story is the break between the ideals of law school where everything is black and white while in the real practice of law the problems are much more mundane, like billing enough hours, putting up with the managing partner.  <br /> <br />The legal cases that come in, kind of on the side when compared to the rest of the story. To be sure they are interesting cases: trying to save a death row inmate, a class action suit against a Texas chemical company after an explosion killed dozens of workers.  <br /> <br />This is not a legal thriller where the answers are clear. A lot of time is spent on the philosophy of the law itself. I came away with the feeling that this is the way it is, and tat while this is the best system created so far, it's still pretty poor.  <br /> <br />It made it clear that I don't want to be involved with the law.	2005-07-07

Reagan will probably go down in the history books as one of the better presidents during this time period. After all, at the beginning of the period we were in the midst of the Cold War and at the end it was over, the Soviet Union was no more. Untold fortunes spent, tremendous risks of nuclear war, all were gone, the Cold War was over.  <br /> <br />Note that this is concerned with Ronald Reagan conservative views. This is not necessarily the same as the George W. Bush views. Mr. Bush seems to have taken the conservative agenda re abortion, affirmative action, and other issues much further than did Reagan.  <br /> <br />The present day conservative Republicans would have you believe, would like to believe themselves that the country has made a major turn to the right wing. They view the past election as confirmation of this rightward shift. I believe they are ignoring the fact that a couple of week candidates in the form of Kerry/Edwards, and good fundamental politics on the part of the Republicans (especially the Ohio grass roots effort) enabled a victory.  <br /> <br />It is at their risk that they forget that the country isn't as right wing as the stalwarts of the Republican party.

That was, however, after the conquering phase.  <br /> <br />While a country was being conquered it was pretty rough. The standard rule was to approach a city, if the city surrendered all was fine. Any resistance at all and everyone in the city was killed. This tended to make the next city surrender.  <br /> <br />By any measure, Genghis Kahn was one of the great military leaders of all time. The empire he conquered stretched from the shores of the pacific to the very gates of Europe. His exploits are less well known than others because of his Eastern origin, yet his empire was twice (or more) the size of that conquered by Alexander.  <br /> <br />This is a small book, intended for younger readers, but gives an accurate telling of this rather unknown story.	2005-07-06

Unlike a talent for singing or telling jokes, their performance has to depend on the setting of an expectation in the part of the audience and then performing something that you would normally think impossible. When you strip away the sleight of hand tricks, magicians are essentially masters of attracting and holding attention and impressing audiences, exactly the psychological secrets you need to be successful in life and business.  <br /> <br />In this book Mr. Cohen talks about, not the magic tricks themself, but the staging of a magic show. How do you keep the audiences attention where you want it? How do you prepare them for something unexpected so that they will remember your point later? How do you make them listen to you carefully so that they won't miss a word, and thus remember it better? How do you sense what people are thinking, and perhaps more important, feeling while you are presenting so you can make them feel like they are getting your points?  <br /> <br />Remember, he's talking about showmanship, not magical tricks. For those you need a different book. For some interesting tips on how to hold attention while making a presentation, this is the book.	2005-07-06

That's basically, and basically means that a lot of the same electronic circuitry is used in both systems. Having said that, the PLC has a lot of differences in the way they are built, PLC's have to operate in filthy, hot, electrically noisy environments that would kill PC's.  <br /> <br />More important, the engineers that program PLC's are taught to use different programming methods, different kinds of flow charts, different kinds of terminology than conventional computer programmers.  <br /> <br />This book starts out by showing the ladder type logic diagrams used by PLC people. It then leads to a series of 'process control' applications that utilize concepts already familiar to the student, i.e. a logic chart to decide whether or not to date someone. Other tasks, a burglar alarm and a traffic light are less interesting, but closer to the actual applications the student will find in real life.	2005-07-06

His books show an insight far beyond the traditional click here to do this approach. Two, he writes far better than any other Excel writer that I have ever seen. Three, he gives you his e-mail address. He invites comments or suggestions about the book and says that he unfortunately cannot answer specific questions. But on the couple of occassions where I've had questions, I asked and he answered. They were, I think, pretty good questions, it well may be that he can't take the time to answer the simple obvious questions where the answers are in his book.  <br /> <br />As the title implies, this book consists of a couple of hundred quick little things that mostly fall into the \\"I could have done that if I'd only thought that this was what I wanted to do\\" type. This includes things like wrapping text in a cell.  <br /> <br />Some of the other points, like why does Excell take a credit card number and make the last digit a zero, fall into the obvious once you see the explanation.  <br /> <br />This is not for the absolute beginner, you need to have some experience with Excell before you realize that you need the information that is here. For the advanced beginner to intermediate or even advanced user, the tips and tricks here will save you time and effort.	2005-07-06

This book is aimed at covering all aspects of Spring from introducing it to the beginner to covering advanced topics that ensure that even experienced Spring users will find information to help them use Spring more effectively. <br /> <br />The book is aimed at the Java/J2EE developer or architect who wants to use Spring in anything from simple web applications to complex enterprise systems. Obviously a rather complete knowledge of Java/J2EE/JDBC/EJB/JMS/OO Design/SQL is assumed.  <br /> <br />The book is written by the Spring development team. As such it gives a complete understanding of:  <br /> <br />WHAT Spring offers, including its large feature set and how these features form a coherent whole.  <br /> <br />WHY spring does what it does and gives a rationale for Spring's approach.  <br /> <br />WHEN to use Spring and the best practices to follow when using Spring.  <br /> <br />This is the most complete, most authoritive book available on Spring and is likely to remain the basic text (as modified in subsequent editions of course) to Spring.	2005-07-06

You might well guess that the view he takes of the Masons is pretty favorable.  <br /> <br />For instance, the book starts out with President Truman's visit to the Beech Grove Lodge No. 8 on October 15, 1948. He concludes, \\"Truman's visit was not an attempt to seek votes. It reflected his genuine interest in the masonic fraternity and the fraternity's importance in his life.\\" Is he kidding? Nothing done during a campaign is not an attempt to seek votes. President Truman could have gone to a different lodge each night, but this one, with the Secret Service and press waiting outside sent a message to masons all around the country.  <br /> <br />This kind of one sided view is common throughout the book. But the value of the book is in going beyond this one sided view to look at the overall history of the organization down through its several centuries of existance.  <br /> <br />We are now at a time when organizations such as the Masons are declining in size and importance. Still they are an influence in thousands of small towns around the country, and this book is important in understanding the organization history and goals. This book alone will not be enough to end the 40 year decline in membership but it may help.	2005-07-06

In this book three stories of Simon, Catherine and Luke (with slight name changes) take place in New York over about three centuries. In a way, New York is a fourth character in the stories as it changes so much yet remains so similar. The fifth character is Walt Whitman who provides yet another link between the stories as well as the title of the book.  <br /> <br />The middle story, called the Children's Crusade is the story set in our time. As with many of today's writers, it is Mr. Cunningham's version of the post-9/11 times, combined with the suicide bombers now seen so often in the news from Iraq. This is perhaps the most chilling of the stories as it pictures a search for young suicide bombers.  <br /> <br />The other stories are more difficult to relate to modern times. One story is set in the late 1800's is the more or less traditional worker as a component of a machine story. A tragic time, but the factories got enough workers to imply that the alternative was worse. The final story is set far enough in the future where the Cathering character is a four-and-a-half-foot tall green lizard refuge from another planet. I found myself wondering if she would get a job as a taxi driver. She might be easier to talk to than some of the drivers you get today.  <br /> <br />What makes any novel is the quality of the writing. And in this catagory Mr. Cunningham is a consumate master. The imagery he creates with words rivals that of artists with their paints.	2005-07-06

Nothing grabs my attention, then neither does the book. Once in a while I find something that I want to cook, then a page or two away something else, and then in another few pages -- well you get the idea.  <br /> <br />That was the case with this book. First I found \\"grilled garlic swordfish with chipotle chile sauce and polenta.\\" Swordfish is certainly becoming common, but I've always found it to be so mild that it had no flavor. Chili sauce on top of it, sounds really good. And polenta is just yankee talk for grits. Being a southerner anything with grits has got to be good. Tonight's dinner.  <br /> <br />A few pages away is \\"seared ahi tuna with lilikoi-shrimp salsa.\\" Just the picture was enough to attract my attention. The tuna is seared really hard, hard enough that the top looks almost well done. But this was done on a relly hot cast iron skillet. It was only cooked for a half minute on each side for rare to 1 and a half minutes for medium-rare. It's beautiful. And then the passion fruit (Lilikoi) shrimp salsa sounds like it would add a most interesting set of conflicting tastes. Next Saturday when guests are coming over.  <br /> <br />It turns out that there are several tuna recipes, a lot of them sound good. I like tuna, and it's something that most of my guests seem to like. I'll use several of these. <br /> <br />As the title says, this book is on fish and seafood. There's no beef, pork, etc. in it. This is a welcome addition to the bookshelf, as even here in the desert west we are seeing a lot more variety in seafood, and more and more people are asking for it.	2005-07-05

At different times these rulers have Turks, Germans, Russians and others. The secret to survival of the Romanian culture has been an ability of influential Romanians to outwit powerful outsiders while attempting to accept their 'alien ways.'  <br /> <br />The result is a country with an entrenched dominant party or oligarchy have created a partly democratic country with limited, tolerated opposition and a week independent sector but little real democratic culture.  <br /> <br />With the fall of Ceausescu in 1989 democracy resulted, but essentially the same power structure remained through the Social Democratic Party.  <br /> <br />This book presents a view of a Romania at a crossroads where the traditional powers that be are being confronted with an outside view as Romania has joined NATO and the EU, and local democratic forces are growing tired of the blatant corruption.  <br /> <br />Romania could well be one of the world's next trouble spots.	2005-07-01

The ones made by my grandmother, let alone the ones made by the grandmother of a friend of mine, are so much better than the ones I've been able to make.  <br /> <br />I found though, that Mr. Villas has the same problem. In his case it was a great-aunt. She threw in a little of this, a little of that, put them in the oven, and then without even looking to see if they were ready, she'd take them out -- perfect biscuits. ==Instead, the rest of us have to follow recipes, try this, try that and finally come up with biscuits that at least begin to approach grandmothers.  <br /> <br />Here in this book is several pages of what you might call biscuit lore -- what kind of fat, yeast, flour (where do you get Southern flour made from soft winter wheat). Well you can order it through the mail, but you pay $7 for shipping $2 worth of flour -- that's OK, it's worth it, after all, that's the way you have to order good quality grits.  <br /> <br />I haven't tried all 101 'foolproof' recipes in the book.

Bush instituted the first in depth re-analysis of the American nuclear policy in many years. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of international terrorism so changed the international situation that the previous policies were essentially useless.  <br /> <br />This book is a detailed analysis of the changes in the policy. It consists of eighteen chapters, each written by a recognized authority in a specialized area. Representative chapters cover Command & Control, Missile Defense, Arms Control, The NATO Relationship, and of course a great deal of information on the Nuclear Posture of the United States.  <br /> <br />The conclusions are fairly dramatic: Russia is now regarded as a friendly nation rather than an enemy, Nuclear weapons have been removed as the central focal point of U.S. strategic capabilities, the reorganization of the armed forces to eliminate the Space Command and replace it with a more integrated Strategic Command, A greater emphasis on intelligence matters, and more.  <br /> <br />The strategic problems facing the U.S. at the moment appear more complex and difficult than in the Cold War era where there was one acknowledged enemy rather than a wide complex of rogue states and non-governmental entities such as Al-Quaida.  <br /> <br />This book provides a policy, a starting point from which the actual strategic plans of the U.S. will be developed.	2005-07-01

Yet the native cultures, the social philosophies and behaviors have resisted change.  <br /> <br />Even in the developed countries the public satisfaction with the service received from government administration is not held in high regard. In much of the third world the governmental agencies are notoriously bad.  <br /> <br />This book analyzes the public administration around the world in a series of essays, each written by a specialist in a particular geographic area. The essays cover developed countries such an the U.S., Britain, Belgium, etc; and the developing countries such as Russia and perhaps China; and the true third world of Africa and the middle east.  <br /> <br />In addition to the analysis of the individual countries or cultures, there is discussion on a wide range of subjects such as globalization which is opposed by a wide range of people even as is proceeds at an ever increasing rate.   <br /> <br />This book is a snapshot of the operation of the world as it exists today. One weakness that I see is any thinking about the changes in the world that will enevitably occur with the ever increasing shortage of oil. I would like to have these authors make some guesses as to how this will affect their regions of the world.	2005-07-01

It was probably stronger than all the rest of the navies in the world put together. After the war it was reduced in size but still remained very formidable. The ships of 1815 had been modernized, but would still have been identifiable to sailors in the days of Drake and the Spanish Armada.  <br /> <br />After this time, a series of rapid changes began. As early as 1824 it began the construction of steam powered ships, initially tugs, but was one of the first navies to move to steam warships, ironclads, and iron warships.  <br /> <br />This book is a concise short history of the Royal Navy from 1815 to the present time.

In this book Professor Thomas Woods takes the approach that, \\"The Church built Western civilization.\\"  <br /> <br />To a certain extent you have to agree with him. During the middle ages the church remained the center of knowledge. The priests retained what knowledge existed in the form of written records. And the church did a lot to help in the formation of the legal system as we now know it.  <br /> <br />At the same time there was evil if you did not agree with the Church authorities. Galileo was 'shown the instruments of torture' and sentenced to house arrest for the remainder of his life for reporting what anyone with a telescope could see, but which conflicted with the teaching of the Church. And I note that the word 'inquisition' isn't even in the index.  <br /> <br />We are living in a time where even sided discussions are in short supply. There has been a lot of material published against the Church lately (birth control is a big one) it's fair to have a book so filled with praise as a counter.	2005-06-30

Yet at the same time the military is in a constant state of change. Since the end of conscription, the end of the Cold War, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union the militaries of the world have been in a state of rapid change. This change has been more apparent in the major countries of Europe and the United States than in many parts of the world such as the Middle East and Africa.  <br /> <br />This book is on the military as a social organization. This encompasses both the relationship between the military and society, and the inside view of the social structure of the military institution itself. The book is a series of articles written by specialists in military sociology from around the world. Authors are from the US, Germany, England, Canada, Slovenia, the Netherlands, Russia and France.  <br /> <br />Many different aspects of military life are addressed from the changes in communications with family at home (i.e. the impact of e-mail), to veterans affairs, the demands of a low (or zero) casualty rate, and more.	2005-06-30

Certainly you will realize that this is the answer that the computer Deep Thought came up with after seeking the answer for seven and a half million years. And 42 is the answer to the ultimate question, but unfortunately we don't know what the ultimate question is. It may have something to do with the fact that 6 x 9 = 42 if you're doing your arithmetic with a base of 13. <br /> <br />If you've followed this, you're a Douglas Adams fan. (Do a Google search on 42 and you come up with about 143,000,000 references to 42.)  <br /> <br />This book though isn't about 42 (well not very much), it's about the real science behind what Douglas Adams was writing about. He was a science writer, and at the time he was starting the series new information about the Big Bang, dark holes, multiple universes, quantum weirdness and serious debates on alien life first took on a real understanding. Mr. Adams used these theories and more, adjusted with a great deal of wit, to provide some basis for his stories. Mr. Hanlon is less witty, but gives the real science behind Mr. Adams stories. It's fascinating reading.	2005-06-30

In the Vor Game, told here on nine CD's, he has finally been allowed to complete training at his planet's Military Academy and gets his first assignment.  <br /> <br />As you would expect he gets involved in a nefarious plot, barely escapes but solves the situation. From there he goes on to investigate a suspicious military build up that might mean their enemies are up to something, then the emperor disappears. All kinds of sub-plots tell many conflicting stories, but good has to triumph in the end so that Miles can go on to the next book.  <br /> <br />This sounds worse than I intend, but explaining the plot in only a few words is difficult. I think Ms Bujold's books are among the best sci fi written in recent years, and those about Miles are among the best of recent science fiction.

The book is based largely on an unidentified source code named 'Ali' who has supplied numerous memos to the Congressman.  <br /> <br />Further Mr. Weldon attacks the American intelligence community. This includes the CIA, DIA, and NSA. While it's clear that these agencies didn't do enough to prevent 9/11, it isn't clear that they haven't shifted resources to provide better coverage in the future.  <br /> <br />The biggest counter to this book is the assertion by the CIA that 'Ali' is a fraud, supplying this 'intelligence' material for money. This wouldn't be bad, unless, as the CIA says, the material is pure fiction, made up just to sell.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there is only one clear solution to this problem. And that is to see what happens in the future. If the future holds terrorist acts predicted by 'Ali,' then the CIA and the rest of the intelligence community have some explaining to do. If not, then it will appear that Mr. Weldon was duped by 'Ali.' If there is a terrorist action kind of like, but not identical to what 'Ali' describes, then both sides will claim to be right.  <br /> <br />The material in this book needs to be known, unfortunately the risks of being wrong are very high.	2005-06-29

I first look in the Index for Grits. First I look to see how many recipes use grits. Then I look to see if any of them sound any good. If one of them jumps out at me so strongly that I want to have it for supper, I'm hooked. At least hooked enough to look at other things.  <br /> <br />I opened this one as above, and I'm having Cheese Shrimp-and-Grits Casserole from page 102 for dinner tonight. One thing about this recipe is the use of chicken broth rather than water for the grits. I've used chicken broth with rice but not grits. 'Gotta try it.  <br /> <br />I also note that in the 'Cooks Chat' column about this recipe there is a comment that this might also be good if cooked with crawfish instead of shrimp. That sounds good too, but we were planning on shrimp so maybe crawfish in a week or two.  <br /> <br />A lot of the recipes here are good, 'Fried Pork Chops with Cream Gravy' for instance, but doesn't everybody already know how to do that?  <br /> <br />Then I found Slow-Roasted Pork, page 195. Some ingredients here like orange juice, grapefruit juice, lemon juice that I'd never thought to try. And it's suggested that it be served over Caribbean Rice and Peas, page 321 ... That's for this weekend when some people are coming over.  <br /> <br />Well I guess you get the idea, a bunch of standard old favorites, and some new ones with an uncommon selection of ingredients. This is a collection of favorites, and some of these may become my favorites after I try them.	2005-06-29

The techniques of raising high dollar amounts from few contributors requires a different mind set, different techniques than the standard #10 envelope, bulk rate, and mass mailings. Instead the appeal package is usually more expensive ($5 each - no not a typo), and the mailing list is very selective.  <br /> <br />Not every organization is ready, or even capable of raising money in these kinds of appeals. But when the right appeal is made to the right audience, the rewards can be great.	2005-06-29

I first learned about these camps many years ago when a friend of mine of Japanese ancestry was talking. As a teenager, he had been put into a camp (just like in this book, his parents were living in the Seattle area) and after a few years he reached draft age and was drafted into the Army from the concentration camp. I would have felt rather angry at a Government that did that to me, but he had accepted it gracefully.  <br /> <br />The Army took one look at him and said, 'Japanese interpreter.' He said, 'I'm third generation, I don't speak a word of Japanese.' 'You will.' He did.  <br /> <br />The treatment of these people seems to have been a combination of racism, fear, and some feel a desire on the part of some people to get their lands and buildings. No only was there never a proven case of anything at all against these people, there was not even an accusation of problems among the far more Japanese Americans in Hawaii. There was never a suggestion of moving German-Americans or Italian-Americans into camps. My friend's father died in the camp. Two brothers joined the famed 442 Regimental Combat Team, one was wounded and highly decorated, the other was killed in action.  <br /> <br />This is a book that reminds us that a real group of people were treated pretty poorly by the rest of us and still retained a sense of well being. Very well done.	2005-06-29

I don't know if you'd call this a cookbook, a novel, an autobiography, or maybe even history. I've now seen mysteries, novels, and memoirs written with this concept.  <br /> <br />In the book part of this work, the stories follow the courses in a meal: Appetizers, First Courses, Second Courses, Eggs, etc. The stories that go in each of these chapters are at best loosely connected to each other. Each stands on its own and presents a short succinct story.  <br /> <br />Likewise I don't see much connection between the recipes and the stories they accompany. What, for instance, does visiting with her mother while her father retreated into his room 'resting' have to do with 'Cream of Peas,\\" the recipe that is next to it.  <br /> <br />I think that in truth the recipes somehow serve as a marker of the time. She cooked the Cream of Peas that night or something like that.  <br /> <br />The recipes I would call non-traditional Jewish Italian. Some of them, Pork Chops with Oranges are really good and very simple to make. The stories have become classics in Italy. They are quite dependent on the culture of the time to make a lot of sense. There is some attempt on the part of the translators to add information on her culture, but being an American male, it's difficult to understand the viewpoint of an Italian female of thirty years ago.	2005-06-29

In the first part of the book the author talks about relatively recent research into the weather changes in the last hundred thousand or so years. This is based on things like drilling cores into the ice in Greenland and Antarctica. Trapped air in bubbles in the ice provide clues to the climate at the time.  <br /> <br />After that the author begins to look into the effects of these changes on life at the time. This includes both plant and animal life as well as human. The author contends, and with some very good reasoning, that the climatic conditions at the time did a lot to define an awful lot of things that we take for granted today, things like the differing gender roles, color blindness (men are about 20 times more likely to be color blind than women), migration patterns (a lot of the old thinking has been revised in view of DNA studies).  <br /> <br />One striking point is the possibility or even likelyhood that there was a migration from Europe to America in the 20,000 year ago time period. This is was suggested by the similarity of arrowheads (the Clovis points) in America and parts of Europe. Then DNA evidence of Indians living around the Great Lakes seem to have a different lineage than the rest of the American Indians.  <br /> <br />This is a new book that reflects the new theories that result from recent scientific discoveries.	2005-06-29

Today the U.S. Supreme Court issued their ruling on several cases about the constitutionality of religious displays on public property. Displays of the Ten Commandments were central to the case. Although the overall message was mixed, it seems that they can be displayed when they are viewed as a foundation for our laws. It is illegal to display them as a symbol of any specific religion.  <br /> <br />This book has a really quite simple premise. There are ten commandments as handed down by Moses. Each commandment gets a chapter. There is not a heavy Christian emphasis on the commandments, after all, they date from long before Christ. The book would probably pass muster in the Supreme Court's view.  <br /> <br />More than a simple description of each commandment, each chapter uses the theme of the commandment to examine an aspect of American society. Most of these views are not good. They focus on the poor, the uneducated, the hopeless. It's a view of the underside of America, frightening in what it shows.  <br /> <br />A Powerful, Eye Opening Book.	2005-06-28

The sub-title of this book says a lot, there is a passion in the real estate business in Manhattan. In a space of only a few square miles the rich (sometimes famous, sometimes not) have created a strange sub-culture that exists just like others around the city.  <br /> <br />The difference here is that these people are the people you would expect to be secure in their lives, not filled with petty gossip and rivalries. But that's not the case. A good bit of the book is about the co-op board who has the right to accept or reject a new prospective purchaser. For instance no attractive divorced women need apply, the wives of the existing tennants don't want their husbands riding in the elevators with them. Likewise, no single men, we, after all, don't want gays in our building. I was surprised to read a lot of this. I would have thought that the civil rights legislation would have prevented such actions. But perhaps that was only to be applied in the South.  <br /> <br />Very interesing side of the housing market.	2005-06-28

This has long been a staple of my diet. Some people start thinking about a meal and wonder how they are going to fix the potato, others start with noodles. I start with rice.  <br /> <br />Then the second sentence under Basic White Rice says that she prefers the fluffy long grain varieties such a basmati and jasmine. I buy jasmine in 25 pound bags. Then after the basic rice comes Fried Rice, two kinds of Pilaf, Herbal Rice and some more. <br /> <br />The difference in this book is that the follows the guidelines of the Department of Health and Human Services in the formation of a healthy diet. Instead of the basic guidelines, the book uses the guidelines as a start for the development of delicious as well as healthy dishes.  <br /> <br />The author spent years in the orient learning their culture which strangely enough tends to followed the HHS recomendations fairly closely.	2005-06-28

On the second page we learn that she has delivered and is delivering this child without medication. This is a choice on her part, offering the pain of her labor to God for the health fo her baby and for her mother's return to the Catholic Church. Later on he prays, \\"Lord Jesus, accept this suffering as an offering for the salvation of Deirdre's mother, for her return to the church, and for the health of the baby. Lord give her strength to bear this suffering.\\"  <br /> <br />That rather sets the tone of Mr. Lickona's life and beliefs. The book is a series of short (ten page or so) essays on the development of his rather extreme faith in the Catholic Church. Anyone who habitually wears a scapular (monk's robe) in today's society has to be viewed as pretty far out.  <br /> <br />As you would expect, his views on abortion, even contraceptives are pretty right wing. One statement, \\"for a child to be born into a life of unremitted misery is a terrible thing, but for a man and woman to take part in a contraceptive act to prevent such a birth is worse.\\"  <br /> <br />It's fascinating to see such complete confidence that his views are correct. It's a little scary to realize how close this is to the Muslim fundamentalists that are acting so crazy around the world. I enjoyed reading this book, even though I disagreed with many of his views. I certainly hope that his views don't become law.	2005-06-28

It would seem that it would be a better world if we had a return to a higher form of morality.  <br /> <br />Second, one of the bigger problems facing the world is AIDS. That word doesn't even make it into the Index of the book. Mr. Shapiro's discussions on sex education seem to say that sex education should be oriented around teaching of abstinence. Is he really saying that kids should be kept ignorant about AIDS about how their bodies work? Is he saying Ignorance is Bliss?  <br /> <br />Third, I get very concerned about who is to define that morality. Today around the world we are seeing conservative religious fanatics (mostly of the Muslim faith) take over governments and impose their view of morality (girls don't need to be educated, forced female circumcision, wearing the Chador) upon the populace. Who does Mr. Shapiro say should be the one setting the rules. I'm not so sure that I want Mr. Shapiro being the rule maker for the rest of us any more than I would like some ayatollah. One problem I have with writers like Mr. Shapiro is that they attempt to define the way that the rest of us should think. They are first certain that they are right and second they can't believe that the rest of the people don't see things the same way that they do.  <br /> <br />A book worth reading to understand the right wing view.	2005-06-27

It began with purchases in 1938 of planes that were largely training planes, transports (some of which were made into patrol planes and bombers). By the end of the war, literally thousands of aircraft were delivered of virtually type to the big countries like England and Russia and a dozen or more others including Cuba, Ethiopia, and Norway among others.  <br /> <br />This book discusses each receiving country and each type of plane being delivered. Because of the large expanse of time some rather uncommon aircraft such as early greenhouse cockpit P-51's with Allison engines, a P-80 Shooting Star as delivered to England and Italy, a P-61, even some early helicopters and experimental gliders.  <br /> <br />This book makes very interesting reading.	2005-06-25

Globalization is accelerating yet localizing processes remain powerful.  <br /> <br />The presenters at this conference are trying to predict the future. While predicting the future is easy, being right is very difficult. These authors present differing view points, some in direct conflict with each other.  <br /> <br />Their views range over nearly every issue imaginable: AIDS, nuclear weapons, environment, OPEC, terrorism, government and non-governmental organizations. Many of these subjects are addressed by different authors and each gives a different slant, a different point of views. The authors are from various countries, including Turkey, United States, United Kingdom, Egypt, and Denmark so you would expect differing points of view. The opinions of these authors are very thought provoking.   <br /> <br />You can be sure that the future will not be exactly like what any of these authors believe, but their thinking certainly provides a starting point to thinking about the future.	2005-06-25

It stresses a hands-on operational approach rather than concentrating on mathematical design. The 24 chapters (including one chapter on the CD) can be conbined in various ways to teach courses in several areas including: electrical motors, solid-state variable-speed drives, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), servomechanisms, sensors, and various specialty areas such as instrumentation or process control.  <br /> <br />In the PLC area, the Allen-Bradley SLC-500 is used for examples. This provides a consistency with the equipment used in today's education and training program.  <br /> <br />In addition to the chapter on practical applications, the CD that comes with the book also includes a lab manual so the student does not need to purchase another book. The publisher also provides additional material related to this title on their web site, however as of yet the on-line material still refers to the second edition rather than to this new third.  <br /> <br />This book is well thought out, it's approach is sound. Very little mathematics are used in the book, it is more of a descriptive, hands on book.	2005-06-24

The first entry under grits in this book is called Hot Brown with Fried Cheese Grits. Now you're not only talking grits, but fried as well. How can you get more Southern than that? And the more I looked at this recipe the sooner I had to try it. It was wonderful. The recipe called for it to be used as a bread replacement in an open faced turkey sandwich. Unfortunately the fried cheese grits by themselves were all eaten before the turkey could get put on them. Oh well, I'll just do another batch.  <br /> <br />I'm actually from the Atchafalaya (Pronounced chaf-a-lie - I know, I know, but that's the truth.) Basin, so Crawfish Etouffee was a big thing when I was a kid. Now most crawfish are being imported from China rather than the Atchafalaya swamps. They of course aren't as good, how could they possibly be, but they'll do. Just remember to do as the book says and don't boil them too much.  <br /> <br />The editors comment that there seems to be no regional or even generally agreed upon recipe for fried oysters. So the editors whipped up a bunch of different ones and say that the one in the book is the best they found. It certainly has some different stuff in it. I haven't tried it yet, tomorrow night. The thing I'd add is use small size oysters rather than the giant ones you can get now a days. They get crisp rather than having the soft insides like the larger ones.  <br /> <br />That's enough writing. I tried a few other recipes, most worked out very, very well. (One we didn't like, but I think that one was my fault, I changed a couple of things.) This is a good Southern cookbook, possibly even the best.	2005-06-24

As soon as you open it you start to see color printing everywhere. There must be dozens, if not hundreds of four color images, and they are scattered throughout the book. This isn't at all like a lot of books that only have a few color plates. It also appears to be a higher quality paper that looks brighter than the other books in the series. This makes sense because Photoshop is a highly color oriented software package. The really nice thing about all this is that they didn't raise the cost significantly. A lot of books printed like this one are twice the price.  <br /> <br />Of course the real test of a book is not its appearance, but its content. This book is aimed at the beginner to intermediate level user. It kind of combines a tutorial and a reference approach. The first few chapters are really introductory. It doesn't make much sense to jump around in them. But after that the chapters are pretty much stand alone. You can use the index or the general chapter heading to find the particular area that interests you and get the information you need.  <br /> <br />This is a welcome addition to photoshop literature. While it's aimed at the beginner, even an expert will find a few points that will help him on his next project. The author runs a help desk in real life. That means he knows what people are going to ask and he included it in his book. Very well done.	2005-06-24

White collar crime likewise gets less police or congressional attention. Even when, as in this case lives are at stake, there is usually little attention being paid at any level.  <br /> <br />In this book, Ms. Eban, an investigative reporter specializing in the medical area reports on the rise in counterfeit drugs being sold through the traditional drug outlets such as hospitals, pharmacies and nursing homes. She exposes the way drugs are really distributed in the United States. What would at first appear to be a straight forward path from licensed manufacturer selling to licensed wholesalers, selling to licensed pharmacies turns out to be much more confusing than that. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of small companies involved with questionable licensing, inspection, quality control and some of these are definitely people you don't want handling the drugs your life depends on.  <br /> <br />Ms. Eban points out the problems with the drug distribution channels (another of those where the companies see no need for governmental control as they are going to police themselves). She also reports on numerous cases where definite illegal activities including mis-labelling, counterfeiting, and theft have been involved, with the bad drugs then entering the legitimate distribution system. Ms. Eban estimates that as much as 1% of the drugs sold through pharmacies are tainted in some manner.  <br /> <br />Another aspect I hope she investigates for her next book, I have seen estimates that half or more of the drugs ordered from Internet companies is really just sugar pills.	2005-06-23

OK, what do we do now. It doesn't seem that the world has gotten a significantly safer or better place. Terrorism, AIDS, and energy prices are major problems that seemingly just are not being addressed. The news spends far more time on Terry Schiavo or Michael Jackson than they do on these three subjects. There was also very little discussion during last years Presidential race on such substantiative issues.  <br /> <br />In this book the author says that the United States is at a point where it has an Oportunity to organize a world that is a better place to live. He addresses the issues of terrorism, AIDS and energy to some extent, but does not provide good concrete proposals. Oil today is within pennies of $60 a barrel. Demand is going up, production is not. What happens to the world economy if oil is at $100 or $250 a barrel? He offers no real solution. He does point out that the use of nuclear energy is probably the only real solution. He does not say anything about the public reaction to building more nuclear plants.  <br /> <br />I really liked his discussion of the problems and the opportunity that the United States faces. The future is going to be an interesting time.	2005-06-22

We install anti-virus packages, firewalls, anti-spyware and so on. These kinds of packages are designed to stop attackers from getting into our systems. We typically do not attempt to investigate who is attacking us or why, we just want them to stay out of our systems.  <br /> <br />This book is aimed at a different point. It is about collecting evidence that will stand up in court and be understood by a jury. This is not a small problem, the FBI was worked on nearly 10,000 cases in 2003. The book is aimed at the beginner to intermediate level. It explains the problem, gives some ideas on the approach to solving the problem, some software that you might try to do things like recover data that's not readable, etc.  <br /> <br />Beyond the standard criminal type problems, the book discusses some of the more serious problems likely to be encountered in the future. This includes terrorism, information warfare, cyber spying and the like.  <br /> <br />This is the second edition of this book, updated from the edition of 2002. It reflects trends and changes to the threat that have developed since then.  <br /> <br />The CD from the book contains several computer forensics software tools and the documentation to go with them. It's an excellent introduction, a bit short on the technical details. Using this introduction you can at least see where you might want to spend more time studying.	2005-06-22

There's a big flack in the news every so often about homosexual men or women marrying. The unwed mother rate is sky high, and there seems no stigma attached to it at all. Some sects (or perhaps cults) of Mormons actively practice polygamy. Half of the marriages end in divorce and most of the divorced people re-marry - serial polygamy perhaps. I wonder just how many of the half that didn't divorce really would rather not be with their spouse, but stay with them for who knows what reason. Then again, how many people just live together without 'benefit' of the legal or religious system.  <br /> <br />In the past thirty years, marriages have changed more than in the past few thousand. In 1972 the first prenuptial agreement was written. Is marriage is a period of crisis? Is the concept of a marriage based on love reaching its limits? Do we go back to family arranged marriage, still common in a lot of countries? Undoubtedly none of the above, marriage is going forward in it's own way to an unknown future.  <br /> <br />This book is said to be a history, but it is more than that. It is an analysis of the history of marriage but it is also an analysis of the present state, and a glimpse into the uncharted future.  <br /> <br />I'd say that everyone thinking of marriage should read this book, but it wouldn't do people in love any good. Only from a more advanced age can you look at marriage a bit more realistically.	2005-06-22

The author is neither scientist nor historian, but an English professor.  <br /> <br />When I first picked up the book I was puzzled by the sub-title, why would anyone have any anxiety about something as commonplace as electricity. The answer, of course, is that in those days it wasn't commonplace at all. Experiments had shown that electricity was the basic force that made life work. Working with something so close to the basic life force had to be something that you approached very carefully.  <br /> <br />All in all, this book reminded me of the anxiety that is today being caused by things like stem cell research which like electricity works with the basic fundamentals of life. In the future, will we look back on stem cell research as we now do the concerns about electricity?	2005-06-21

I am reminded of the quotation from Benjamin Franklin, \\"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\\"  <br /> <br />It also seems that the security authorities always want more power, which they promise to not abuse. This happened when Lincoln suspended habeas corpus during the Civil War. It happened in the aftermath of 9/11, and as beautifully described in this book it happened during World War II when the Germans landed eight men to sabotage aircraft plants and railway hubs in the US.  <br /> <br />The planned acts of sabotage never happened, the eight men were captured when one of them turned himself in. Six of them were executed, the other two sentenced to long prison terms. Public opinion was strongly for this action. Legally, Mr. O'Donnell explains the situation was rather disgraceful. And this is the precedent that President Bush is using to justify his actions in detaining \\"enemy combatants\\" in Cuba.  <br /> <br />These are strange times in which we are living, but as this book says, it isn't the first. Let's hope we pull out of this as well as we have in the past.	2005-06-21

It is not a biography exactly, but it contains a lot of biographical data. Where it really shines is in the relationship between Tony Bramwell and the four singers that made up the Beatles. As he grew up knowing three of them he was a natural for staying with them throughout their career.  <br /> <br />Indeed Paul McCartney has been quoted as saying \\"If you want to know anything about the beatles, ask Tony Bramwell, He remembers more than I do.\\" What better recommendation can you get?  <br /> <br />The bare facts of the Beatles are well known. What this book provides is those little interesting side effects that can only come from someone who was there with them living their life. It's these kind of stories that put a more human face on people who were bigger than life. It's a delightful book.	2005-06-21

Well let's see, in the movie 'Eddie Presley' he was the asylum attendent. In Spider-Man he was the announcer in the boxing ring. Not exactly the leading actor in Star Wars. From this background he wrote an autobiography that became a sleeper hit. <br /> <br />Now he has written a novel, 'Make Love! the Bruce Campbell Way.' It's not about making love at all, it's about making a movie called 'Let's Make Love.' As the author says, \\"everything in the book actually happened, except for all the stuff that didn't.\\" That sets the tone. It's semi-autobiographical in that the lead character is him, the story is the kind of story I've heard from a lot of actors, except that the way he tells it is is a lot more fun.  <br /> <br />Don't take this too seriously, but if you have a budding actor in your family, he/she will get a lot of laughs.	2005-06-21

I thought that this particular genre was owned by Anne Rice with no room for a newcommer. And besides that I thought that Harry Potter pretty much owned the rest of the mystical market. It's clear that I was wrong.  <br /> <br />Ms. Kostova has written a classic. It's not a small book, and the detail is tremendous. The book has about four stories going on at once. Still it's not that difficult to keep them straight, and of course they all come together in the end.  <br /> <br />I particularly liked her setting the main character as a sixteen year old girl beginning in 1972. The story is being told by her some thirty-six years later in 2008. As she said, she tells the story of those who survived, and those who did not.  <br /> <br />This is not a terribly bloodthirsty/gruesome novel, but the body count is certainly respectable. I hear that movie rights have been sold, this just may be the start of a new publishing phenomenon.	2005-06-21

She lives and works in the prison in one of Mexico's most notorious jails, a place I would be afraid to even visit. Just to read about her life is frightening. <br /> <br />It is also encouraging as we come to understand that one person can make a difference, that her innate goodness is repaid many times over by the prisoners under her care.  <br /> <br />The two authors of this book won the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for their coverage of Mexico's criminal justice system. They are an ideal pair to look at this small facet of the Mexican system.  <br /> <br />It's an incredible story. Mother Antonia's ability to live this way and to have been able to convince others to help are a sign that maybe, must maybe things aren't as bad as they seem.	2005-06-21

The information on the drugs comes from the manufacturer, has been blessed by the manufacturer's medical department and is based on information officially filed with the FDA. The publisher takes the information from the manufacturer and puts it together in one book with similar information from all of the other manufacturers.  <br /> <br />This book is the one single source for information about all of the approved drugs by all of the manufacturers. This information is combined with an extensive indexing system to enable any drug to be rapidly found. The indexing is in several different sections including indexing by the trade name of the drug, the generic name, the manufacturer, the condition being treated, etc.  <br /> <br />There is also a color section with pictures of both the packaging and the pills or tablets themselves. This is to enable the health care provider to show the patient the picture of the drug to get confirmation of what he is or should be taking.  <br /> <br />This is the standard book for the industry, updated for the latest approved drugs.	2005-06-21

Neither mother-son nor father-either one causes nearly as much trouble. Being a mere male, I mostly watched while my wife and daughter fought (rather unsuccessfully) to establish a changing relationship.  <br /> <br />In this book Karen Stabiner lives through the years when her daughter is from ten to fourteen years old. Karen is pre-warned of the impending troubles and is able to counter most of them. One of her quotes is \\"Even when its difficult, the onus is on the mother to be an adult.\\" She's right about that.  <br /> <br />This is a delightful book about one woman, one child making it through those years. It has a definite ring of truth. To be sure they had a lot more money to do things like a lengthy vacation in Italy, but what they're really saying is spending the time together. We did things like vacation trips to places like Lake Louise in Canada, camping out on the way.  <br /> <br />The problem with this book is that it ends when the kid is 14. Perhaps this is just book 1. Still ahead is dating, sex, drinking, pot ... And oh yes, the drivers license.	2005-06-21

Perhaps that's why he's been able to live to be a hundred years old. With these he can combine the serenity of the garden and the realization that you are planting something that will provide a future pleasure, with the poetry he gets to express his feeling better than simple prose can do.  <br /> <br />This book contains a series of, well, I guess you'd call them essays, reflecting on a century of gardening, of poetry, of life. These were distilled from a series of converstions between Mr. Kunitz and Ms. Lentine. They have never been previously published.  <br /> <br />The poetry, the essays, show a vibrant man, comfortable and serene in his view of the world. This is a beautiful book about a beautiful man.	2005-06-19

One is that it is a book about the formation, rise, operation, decline and fall of a company. The other is that it is about the rise and fall of the telecom market in the early 2000's.  <br /> <br />The author was the CEO of Net2000 a telecom company formed in 1993 to its final hours in 2002. Inbetween was the magical moment of an IPO making the company listed on NASDAC. Only about 300 companies a year do an IPO, and that's out of about 600,000 companies that are started each year.  <br /> <br />The other part of the story is about what happened in the telecomm market during these years. This was the time when WorldCom made the slight error in their accounting, only a small error, just a little over $10 billion.  <br /> <br />This is the book of how they took the company from just an idea in the telecom business, through getting it started, initial funding and finally an IPO. Then the market changed. The best planning they could do failed. I am left with the question of what could another set of managers have done or was the marketplace so disruptive that nothing could have saved them.	2005-06-19

Thankfully, he hit a creative brick wall (since he doesn't really know anything about pottery from China or anywhwere else).\\"  <br /> <br />Also suggested were books on sea turtles, circumnavigation of the globe, building jet engines at home, the sociology of chickens, or fungi of the skin.  <br /> <br />Well you get the tone of the book, even if the book is really a memoir of his life. What else could expect from one of the funnier comics around.  <br /> <br />His story of his first sexual encounter which was with a prostitute is a classic. It should be part of his comedy routine, maybe when he does Vegas.	2005-06-19

Each of these twelve base foods are used as the base ingredients for some 200 recipes. First, I opened the book to the recipes using -- what else -- chocolate. There are twenty or so chocolate recipes.  <br /> <br />Then I found the salsa recipes. Black Bean and Mango Salsa is the only one I've made so far, it rapidly disappeared at a party last weekend. A couple of other dips and salsas are on my to do list.  <br /> <br />I didn't realize that so much good could be made with healthy stuff.

After all, one juror said that she rejected the testimony of the mother because she snapped her fingers at the jury.  <br /> <br />Bob Jones was head of Michael Jackson's company MJJ Communications. He created the answers to many of the bizarre stories created around Michael.

This book is largely the result of what these executives had to say combined with the years of experience that EDA has had in preparing specialized training classes for executives.  <br /> <br />As people have worked their way up the organization, they have had to develop leadership and numerous other skills. At the executive level they are now faced with new challenges. These particularly involve strategic decisions for which they have not been previously responsible.  <br /> <br />Without going into the details of the book, the problems these new executives face include directing the corporation into new organizational forms, bringing new leaders up the chain, and preparing to meet the big changes that are coming in their corporate world. For change is always coming, and to ignore it is to effectively kill the company. What will happen to your company with dramatic jumps in the price of energy? What effect will the Kyoto protocol have? These are the known challenges. You can be sure that the future has a bunch of surprises that executives will have to meet if their companies are to survive.  <br /> <br />This book contains not the answers to these problems, but how to prepare executives to effectively face them.	2005-06-17

On the one hand there was the seemingly minor inconvenience (to the Germans) of the Battle of Tannenberg which took some divisions from France. On the other hand was the impact on Russia itself as a precursor to the revolution a few years later.  <br /> <br />In this  book the author, an expert on Russian history, has written an excellent history of the actions of the Russians during the war. This includes not only the military campaigns but the impact on the Russian citizens, both the elite and the plebeian. Like the rest of the world, Russian industry was mobilized to dramatically increase production. In Tsarist Russia this was somewhat less effective than in other places like the United States. Likewise Russia had problems in feeding themselves.  <br /> <br />These situations seem to have started the problems that remained with the Soviet Union for generations to come. This is a book that points out the beginnings of recent history as we have come to know it.	2005-06-17

It was, of course, launched for purely peaceful, scientific purposes.  <br /> <br />This book talks about the CORONA project which had the public cover name 'Discoverer.'  <br /> <br />Years later I was selling high-tech equipment to the Government. The buyers were organizations with initials like N-PIC and NRO. Even the initials were secret, and the names National Photographic Interpretation Center and National Reconnaissance Office were so far into the 'black' that they weren't even mentioned.  <br /> <br />This book says that the information in it has been cleared for release by these very organizations.  <br /> <br />Once in a meeting someone mentioned 'Keyhole.' I said, \\"What.\\" He shut up really quickly.  <br /> <br />Most of this book consists of pages that were marked \\"TOP SECRET - TALENT - KEYHOLE.\\" TALENT is imagery. KEYHOLE is the camera system (designed by Polaroid).  <br /> <br />I later was talking to an Air Force pilot who had been transferred to Hawaii. when he got there he asked another officer what the deal was. He was told, \\"Oh, we fly out to a spot in the pacific and we use a hook system on the plane to catch a parachute out of the air that is lowering a capsule that has been ejected from a satellite up in space.\\" What a wise ass, he thought until he found out that that was what they were really doing.  <br /> <br />The CORONA images are now available for anyone to use. But now their biggest utility is to examine what has happened over the forty five years since they were taken.  <br /> <br />This book is the first released on CORONA, it consists of the original reports written at the time, declassified but with certain parts blacked out. It's the original scoop.	2005-06-17

This photograph is as complete and beautifully made as if it were taken yesterday of a living insect. And this is only one outstanding picture. Altogether there are 995 photographs and illustrations in the book, the majority of which are in color.  <br /> <br />Extensively researched, there are some 70 pages (large size pages) of references. Every aspect of insect evolution is at least touched upon from the history of the prominent scientists to the insects themselves as they began, developed wings and other distinguishing features, evolved to the forms we see today.  <br /> <br />This is the definitive book on the subject.	2005-06-17

And you can find instances where that was true. But you can find just as many instances where the Americans outnumbered, with inadequate support from armor or artillery outfought the Germans man to man.  <br /> <br />During the Battle of the Bulge there were several such engagements. In the one described in this book the small, very small Intelligence and Reconnaissance platoon was assigned a position before the attack. When the Germans attacked they were told \\"You are to hold at all costs.\\" There was no possibility of support. They held up the German advance by themselves until they ran out of ammunition. Finally captured they were held by the Germans as POWs until the end of the war. After the war they had become the most decorated platoon in World War II.  <br /> <br />This is a book about a small unit action during the war that did its part in holding up the advancing German Army. It's also a book about how the Germans treated American prisoners.	2005-06-17

But what happens when an old agent retires and gets himself confused with the many legends he has lived in his past. What a way to get multiple personality disorder.  <br /> <br />Martin Odum is the retired CIA agent. Or maybe he is Dante Pippen or Lincoln Dittmann. Of course his shrink is the Agency's psychiatrist, perhaps he is the one who created the legends.  <br /> <br />Then of course he gets an assignment. It's a job from a Russian lady to go find her brother-in-law. This takes him (who ever he is) to one country after another, and gets him involved in all kinds of dangerous activities. Then it turns out that the places and incidents have some relationship to the places he actually worked during his career. Who set all this up anyway?  <br /> <br />When in the second sentence the local priest is just getting off of a week long binge, you can guess what to expect. <br /> <br />An interesting offshoot of the typical spy story which is wandering around a lot since the big evil KGB went away.	2005-06-17

You get to wear the Smokey Bear hat, live (mostly) outside, and it doesn't look like the work is all that hard. Now that I read this book, I don't really think that I want to put up with all these idiots.  <br /> <br />There's this comedian who talks about people dumb people having to wear signs saying that they are dumb. He tells jokes about people and concludes the joke with \\"Here's your sign.\\" I'd probably want to go get some signs printed.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile I'll take heart and sit back in my reading chair and learn from Mr. Burnetts expeiences in the parks. After all, the people might take my signs and beat me over the head with them.	2005-06-17

Then when I started looking at the pictures of thing made with puddings, ice cream, cookies, cakes, pies, tarts, oh dear!  <br /> <br />The basic rules here are: minimal cooking (sometimes a stovetop for a few minutes), easy to find ingredients (is there anywhere in the country, even the world, where you can't find Oreo cookies?), chocolate (mandatory, unfortunately addictive -- do you suppose the druggie cops will find out about this one?), some liqueurs (and wines and spirits, especially things like Grand Marnier), fresh fruits, frozen pound cake. etc.  <br /> <br />The fun of cookbooks is taking their recipes and adjusting them to your own likes. Two days from now I'm taking the dessert to a dinner. Her Chestnut Mouse Charlotte with Chocolate-Orange Sauce looks to me like it will convert well into Pecan Mouse Charlotte with Chocolate-Orange Sauce and a layer of Coconut on top of everything else.

Instead it is profusely illustrated with all kinds of rather simple but informative drawings. Then when I did see some photographs of equipment it was of Linksys gear. Only started to read the Foreward of the book did I read that Cisco purchased Linksys. Now it makes sense for them to do a book about Home Networking.  <br /> <br />Cisco specialized in things like big heavy duty networks. I was concerned that they might write a book on home networking the same way. But they didn't. The authors are Cisco people (well, one of them recently left Cisco) but then they tied in with the Geek Squad a volunteer group that offers computer support on the web ([...] It appears that these guys have seen every problem the end user is going to have. They probably read the book and made suggestions, and then once in a while they add a little comment to further clarify what the authors have said.  <br /> <br />Everything you can ask for about home networking is covered. It's covered in an easy to understand manner. All in all, this is the best, most complete book on home networking I've ever seen.	2005-06-16

Instead it appeared that he had peaked early and did litle for the rest of his careet.  <br /> <br />In this extensively researched book, Clinton Heylin uses shooting scripts, schedules, internal memos and much more to come to a different conclusion. He says that the subsequent five movies Wells made were effectively ruined in post-production editing and cutting. For instance his movie 'The Lady from Shanghai' was cut from 155 to 86 minutes.  <br /> <br />I suspect we will never be able to see a 'Director's Cut' of this movie, the 69 minutes that wound up on the cutting room floor were probably thrown away. So looking at the script and what recollections remain after half a century will have to do.  <br /> <br />Mr. Heylin does point out some of the problems that were self inflicted, disappearing for a few days at critical times for instance. The book remains, however, a condemnation of the movie production system. I suspect this remains today as I look at the number of re-makes of old movies, the sequels, and how few original groundbreaking movies get made.	2005-06-16

He gave it to only a few who remained from the Second Rangers. At that spot, forty years earlier to the day, 225 'boys' mostly 19-20 years old landed and climbed the hundred foot cliffs. They were to destroy cannon that would have had the ability to disrupt and possible prevent the D-Day landings. They were to be releived by noon. Instead the Second Rangers were there for four days. At the end of that time there were only 99 left. There were 66 present at Point Du Hoc forty years later.  <br /> <br />There was plenty of background material for a speech and the speech that Reagan gave was supurb. It is included in the book, it's a short speech, five pages. It's not as memorable as the speech given at Gettysburg, but almost.  <br /> <br />This is a book about a moment that changed our history.	2005-06-16

The broader Turkic World, those countries or regions where Turkish is the predominant language, lies to the northeast of Turkey and make up the region that lies between China and Russia.  <br /> <br />In this book, Mr. Pope who heads the Istanbul bureau for the Wall Street Journal, gives a report of his travels throughout this part of the world. He reports on the transition in the countries that were previously part of the Soviet Union. He reports on the religious aspects of a country viewed with suspicion by the Christian West because of their Muslim religion, and shunned by their co-religionists in the Islamic world for its alliance with the Christian West.  <br /> <br />This book is more of a chronicle of Mr. Pope's travels and experiences through this world than a true history. The years since the collapse of the Soviet Union have been years of drastic change in this region. Countries like Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and others are visited and some of their story told.  <br /> <br />This is a region previously hidden in the monolithic Soviet Union. Now it is opening up to be a part of the rest of the world but independently. This book brings this region to light in a light and easily understood manner.	2005-06-16

Originally it found its biggest use in web servers, mail servers and the like. In recent years it has grown into supercomputer clusters, increased scientific/engineering use, and lately increased use as office workstations.  <br /> <br />In the installation sections, Fedora is used as the example of a distribution to install. It does not cover applications, it spends minimal time on the GUIs, it is heavy on the administrative aspects, including setup, networking, and security. The book is designed around the CompTIA 2005 Linux+ certification exam.  <br /> <br />This is an excellent book for what it covers, as the title says, it covers the operating system in depth. It will not be the only book you will need. For instance the vi text editor only gets ten pages. Other packages such as make or ANT are not covered at all. The application packages for graphics, for word processing, for serving web pages, for mail, all have their own books. This one is an excellent start on your library.	2005-06-16

In only one volume there was the complete story of what happened in World War II. In the decade that has passed since its publication there have been many new releases of previously secret files. More information has also become available from the publication of additional memoirs, additional translations from foreign books, and of course from the opening up of the archives of the Soviet Union.  <br /> <br />Here in one book is not only the history of the second World War, but an analysis of why things happened, the faults, the successes. Many of the supposed truths of the war are dispelled by the history of what happened. For instance it is commonly accepted that man for man the Germans were better soldiers than anyone else. Yet here battle after battle is described where the American infantry, in inferior numbers, and lacking adequate armored support held and then defeated the German forces.  <br /> <br />If you have one book in your library on World War II, this should be it.	2005-06-16

There are foods, foods that we even tend to like that are mostly water. The book says eat more water based foods to fill your stomach, and put enough other stuff in your stomach to round our your daily diet to a well balanced nutritionally sound balance.  <br /> <br />The devil, as they say, is in the details. How do you plan such a daily menu. It's got to have lots of low cal stuff. It's also got to have things you like or you won't stick with it. In this book there are a lot of things that you'll like. And it gives two versions of a lot of things, one made using traditional methods, the other using methods that will taste much the same but uses ingredients that have a lot few calories.  <br /> <br />This is an eating plan that makes a lot more sense than taking the time to carefully count carbs or calories. It's a plan that many people are much more likely to stick with. This is a program that's much more painless than most, and it works.	2005-06-16

Like Burke, Mr. Standage looks at the six (well maybe seven) drinks that basically were a technology that changed history.  <br /> <br />To illustrate this I'll talk about only one of his drinks -- Beer. Beer probably began as some leftover cooked grain, perhaps the kids morning cereal, was left outside in the rain. Soaking in water, it turned into malt. Wild yeast fell into the mix, and in a few days the result was beer. While I'd bet it was foul tasting beer, it was the only alcoholic beverage around.  <br /> <br />OK, so you have beer, how does this mean anything? Well, to get more beer, you need more grain. To get more grain you basically move from being a hunter-gatherer to a farmer. You also need the ancillary technologies of pottery to make and store the product. If you have beer, and your neighbors have food, perhaps you can make a trade. Expand on this and you have a need for writing, for record keeping, for accounting. And with accounting can the tax people be far behind? And that's not all. No pathogen lives through the brewing process, so all of a sudden you have a beverage that's safe to drink, cutting down on illnesses. Think about all that the next time you sip a brew.  <br /> <br />Surprisingly, a lot of the glasses Mr. Standage talks about have this same factor of sterilizing the water, thereby cutting down on disease.  <br /> <br />A delightful book, now if we can only get it made into a TV series.	2005-06-16

For instance, the first chapter of this book is on the internal structure of Oracle. That's a long ways from the standard beginning of this is what a database does.  <br /> <br />A thing this book is not for is the database administrator. There's very little on things like set-up, assigning users, security (there's a little on this); those kinds of administrative details. This book is, as I said at first, for developers.  <br /> <br />The book does go heavily into programming techniques like triggers, regular expressions, object types, XML, defining your own functions -- things like that.  <br /> <br />The authors all have extensive experience with Oracle, most of them work for or have worked for Oracle. As this series of books proclaims, this is a book written at the programmer to programmer level.	2005-06-15

What this book does is clearly point out that the idea of cooking light doesn't have to be the usual bland stuff.  <br /> <br />When I opened the book it fell open to Roasted-Poblano Guacamole. Wow! Then I flipped a few pages and came up with Buffalo-Style Catfish Strips. Double Wow!  <br /> <br />There's a whole section on breads. I don't normally bake, but their Jamaican Banana Bread just happened to fit the ripe bananas sitting on the counter. The rum, pecan and coconut topping for the bread sounds great. The bread has just finished cooking as I write so I can't tell about it yet (too hot). I had to sample the topping while preparing it and it's wonderful -- just like the whole house smells.  <br /> <br />This book is organized by the big dishes: breads, meats, soups, desserts, etc. The only real question is how light can these foods be, yet the banana bread took half or less of the sugar that most banana bread recipes require. That's a lot lighter. Highly recommended.	2005-06-15

Once a citizen of Israel he was drafted into the Israeli Army. After eighteen months of active duty he spent the years from 1984 to 2002 as a reservist serving one month a year on active duty with Company C.  <br /> <br />An excellent writer, Mr. Watzman writes of the history of that time from the view of a low ranking soldier. He observed from a low ranking infantrymans point of view the Oslo Accords, Israel's reoccupation of the West Bank, and broadened this to seeing how the rest of the world viewed these same events. At the same time, he has the ability to examine our oblications and our duty to country from both the view of the solfier and the outsider.  <br /> <br />Above all else, what comes through is the small unit comradery. Soldiers don't fight for home, mother and country. They fight so as to not let down their fellow soldiers.  <br /> <br />At the same time literate, sensitive and giving a military view, this is quite a book.	2005-06-15

The U-505 built in Hamburg was launched on May 24, 1941. She was not a lucky boat. While she made several war patrols with modest success, she aborted several patrols to return to port with one kind of problem after another. She was so unlucky that on June 4th of 1944 (two days before D-Day) she was captured just off the coast of Africa. She was the first ship captured by the American Navy since the War of 1812.   <br /> <br />After capture the U-505 was taken into the American Navy and made several tours to Atlantic and Gulf ports to promote the sale of War Bonds.   <br /> <br />Finally she was towed three thousand miles to the mouth of the St. Lawrence, across four of the great lakes to Chicago. There she was made a part of the permanent display of the Museum of Science and Industry. Remodeled to war time condition, the U-505 now sits in a specially constructed building to create a U-Boat experience dedicated to the people who fought the Battle of the Atlantic.	2005-06-15

After all, what can you have one set of characters do without having them do the same things over and over again. In this series, the first three titles were on marching across the planet Marduk. Now, having made it across the planet, captured a space ship it's time to go home.  <br /> <br />Home is not what they remembered. There has been a palace coup, Prince Roger, once a playboy is now first in line for the throne. But taking his place on the throne will not be easy. This moves the action from being a small high-tech force combating natives to an underground action trying to reclaim his throne. Of course you can guess what's going to happen.  <br /> <br />Both Weber and Ringo are succesful authors in their own right. Here their working together brings both of their strengths together. There's a hook left at the end of the book for a follow-up in the series. I don't know if it's true, but there are rumors of as many as three more books in the series.  <br /> <br />One point, the series builds on itself.

The recipe was right on. To be sure, Grandmother used yellow cornmeal rather than white, but that's OK. And in the recipe says \\"stir until the batter is the consistency of grits.\\" -- That's southern.  <br /> <br />Speaking of grits, there are six different dishes cooked with grits. I've only cooked four of those so far. (For you yankees, grits is polenta.) One recipe was not so good, it called for quick cooking grits. No self-respecting southerner would use quick grits. Instead get some good stone ground yellow grits. (Google will give you a lot of choices when you search for \\"stone ground grits.\\" I've not tried them all, but all that I've tried have been good.)  <br /> <br />This book is a collection of recipes from Southern Living magazine. They take a pretty wide interpretation of southern including gumbo from Louisiana, some Texas/western dishes, and even some Mexican.  <br /> <br />As an annual book, this one contains a selection of recipes that were well received by the readers and by the magazine staff.

One part is a story of the Jewish diaspora told from the standpoint of the foods they had in their new lands. This takes the form of a series of essays that discuss the movement of food with the people. As they went to new places, they encountered new ingrediants and couldn't get others. The food had to change accordingly. These essays give a history of some of these changes and are fascinating to see how foods develop through change.  <br /> <br />The other part of the book is a cookbook of Jewish dishes from around the world. Of course there are the old standbys, mostly originating in the middle east. But the variety is what is striking here, you wouldn't think of Bombay curried fish as being a Jewish dish. What about Mexican Baked Blintzes -- what, you don't usually put poblano peppers in your blintzes. Then there's sweet and sour pot roast, brisket with coca-cola and many, many more.  <br /> <br />This is an unexpected book because so many Jewish cookbooks only have the traditionals and here there is so much more, and the stories to go with the dishes.	2005-06-15

This book is nominally the story of the formation of a small company building houses on Martha Vinyard. The sub-title says this is about reinventing small business. That's only part of the story. Another part is that the entire corporate structure of the world is changing.  <br /> <br />The days of going to work for a big company, probably joining a union and remaining there until retirement, are found less and less. Those kinds of jobs are moving to anywhere in the world where they can be performed. And with the growth of education and infastructrure in the world, the global economy is a reality.  <br /> <br />During the last election a big point was made of returning jobs to places like Ohio. Hey, fellows, those rust belt jobs are gone, and they are not coming back. The future lies in the big transglobal companies, and even more important in small business. Virtually all the growth in our employment comes from small companies, not the giants.  <br /> <br />This book presents one way, not the only way, but one good way. It is not an automatic formula for success, but a way that small business can compete, compete very well against the giants. It is a window into the future, worth study.	2005-06-11

And as strong as it is for a father, it must be even stronger for a mother.  <br /> <br />The other word that I find for this book is magic. I suspect that the teckie in me says that this is what you would get from combining good photography and photoshop. In fact I had wondered just what the photoshop special effects would be used for. Now I know. It's to produce magic.  <br /> <br />This is an absolutely wonderful book. Then you combine the music with the words and pictures and you have truly marvelous.

You could say that this is version 10.4, but that'd make you sound like a geek or something. As nearly everybody knows by now, OS X (that's X as in Roman Numerals or 10 in Arabic, pronounced ten not X) is the Mac GUI (Graphical User Interface) on top of Unix. <br /> <br />Why, you might be asking, do you need a book if the Mac interface is so easy to use. Because if you just start using it, and using the help screens you don't get a solid overview. You tend to learn what you need for right now and never get around to all the things that you can do if you just realized that you wanted to do them.  <br /> <br />Having written a whole bunch of previous books for dummies, this one has benefitted from all the comments made about the previous editions. Dr. Mac doesn't think you're really dumb. He would have liked to name this book Mac OS X Tiger For People Smart Enough to Know They Need Help With It.

And Robin Cook's books do this. Marker refers to a \\"marker gene\\" that marks mutated genes which indicate major health problems in the future. This is a direct reference to the mapping of the human genome's 3.2 billion base pairs that was published in draft form about five years ago.  <br /> <br />While this was presented as being very important, it quickly faded from the news as no one could explain just why it was so important. This book explains at least one aspect of why this was so important.  <br /> <br />This book is also a mystery, the two leading figures work in the Manhattan medical examiner's office, so you know that the story will start off with dead bodies. And in the morgue of New York there are a lot of dead bodies. What makes these bodies so special? And of course, who did it, why did they do it, and what will happen to the on-again/off-again relationship with the two heros? Well, since they've been in several of Robin Cook's books so ....	2005-06-10

It is not \\"THE\\" book on the subject. Instead, it is a general overview of how to start a business of your own, and only incidentally uses the idea of a home inspection service as the business to start.  <br /> <br />Before starting your own Home Inspection Service, you do need to know about a lot of things such as licenses, legal aspects, record keeping, setting up an office, and this is all here. The description of most of these is rather brief, but it will tell you at least the general concept of what you need to do.  <br /> <br />As for inspecting homes, this book points you in a few places that you should read and classes you could take. My own experience is that you should go to work for a home inspection service for a while to learn what the business is really like before you attempt to delve into it yourself.	2005-06-10

Even back in Dickens \\"A Christman Carol\\" the relationship was strained. Then around the turn of the last century we had all the efforts with the unions being developed. Now unions are declining and the lawyers have taken over.  <br /> <br />I've had my share of working for bad managers. In fact there've only been a couple that I would have rated as good. Those managers followed the rules that Mr. Janove has written down. This is good legal advice, but it is just plain good management advice as well. This is the way you would want to be treated by a manager, and it is clearly the way you should treat your employees.  <br /> <br />The eight deadly sins he defines are not coached in legal terms, they are just good common sense that we should all follow.	2005-06-10

Without the ability to transport such private information as credit card information, none of the commerce oriented sites from Amazon or EBay, none of the porn sites could exist. The net simply wouldn't be as we know it today.  <br /> <br />Much of the stories that we know of cryptology have to do with the breaking of the German Enigma or the Japanese codes from World War II. These codes would be trivial to break today. Faster more powerful computers, significant advances in the mathematical theory and techniques have made today's cryptography an entirely different animal.  <br /> <br />Dr. Oppliger's book draws a balance between the computer scientist approach who is looking to implement a secure communications protocol, and the mathematician who is interested in the theoretical concepts. This book does not presume to cover any of the many (sometimes conflicting) patent claims, nor the terribly confusing export regulations that are changing even faster than the cryptologic techniques.  <br /> <br />This is the state of the art in cryptography today at the conceptual level.	2005-06-10

Even at the time I can remember watching the television news the night Brown vs. Board of Education (separate but equal education was not equal at all) and realizing that the world was about to change.  <br /> <br />It's good to read this book and review what happened through the eyes of a professional reporter who was actually there for most of the action.  <br /> <br />The title talks about the 'Rough South.' And indeed it was. In looking back on it with fifty years of perspective, it was an amazing transition. And all in all, it was not nearly as rough as it could have been. There were a lot of people there who really hated each other and on both sides. Today there is still some racial friction in the south, but not even a shadow of what it was then.  <br /> <br />This is a remerberance of a time of great fundamental change in out culture very well told.	2005-06-09

After a series of very successful books featuring defense attorney Mary DiNunzio, Ms. Scottoline has turned the tables to write from the other point of view. Her new heroine is Vicki Allegretti, a brand new assistant U. S. Attorney.  <br /> <br />The setting is Philadelphia, that's 'Philly' to anyone from there. The book was inspired by one of the biggest crack cocaine busts in Philly history. The heroine buddies up with Reheema Bristow whom she had kept in jail for a year or so. That part didn't seem too likely, I don't think I'd want to partner up with someone who had kept me in jail. Other than that the story moves along quickly, and has the ring of truth about how the crack cocaine business really works.  <br /> <br />I couldn't help but think, as I read about the crack cocaine business that many years of wars on drugs don't seem to have done much to stem the drug business. This book is, of course, fiction, but the reviews I've read seem to say that this is a pretty good look at the drug business. Pretty bad. I don't profess to have an answer, but one definition of insane is that you keep doing something that you know isn't working.	2005-06-09

Most of the other generals, just like in the American/British armies, had served in World War I.  <br /> <br />Meyer's combat career really began with the invasion of Poland in 1939. From there he fought in most of the major battles: Poland, Rotterdam, France, Balkans, Greece, Peloponnesus, Soviet Union and finally France again. In France in 1944 he was commander of the 12.SS-Panzer \\"Hitlerjugend\\" division. He was heavily involved with the fighting around Caen and the Falaise Pocket where he was captured.  <br /> <br />In British and American histories of Caen and Falaise there is the big argument regarding the British/Montgomery view vs. the American/Patton view. Here is the view of a senior German commander of what happened during the battles. As you might guess, he contradicts both views.  <br /> <br />After the war General Meyer was convicted of war crimes and sentenced to death. This was commuted to life in prison where he actually served nine years. He died in 1961, only 51 years old.  <br /> <br />This book is based on an autobiography he wrote shortly after his release from prison, newly translated from the German.	2005-06-08

It was originally written in 1993 and just reprinted after being very hard to get.  <br /> <br />The Cuban Missile Crisis was the closest the major powers came to actual combat during the Cold War. While all of the services played their part (I can remember nuclear armed bombers parked at the end of Boston's Logan Airport's runways.) the main tasks fell on the Navy.  <br /> <br />The pictures on this book show just how ready the Navy was. Pictures of planes in the air and on carriers show them fully armed with rockets and bombs.  <br /> <br />Only at the end of the crisis did the tensions go down. And in one point a Navy helicopter lowered a Navy tie clasp to the Russian freighter 'Alapayevsk.' The Russians returned with a gift of a bottle of vodka.  <br /> <br />I also remember discussions that we should invade Cuba. Only since the end of the Cold War have we learned that the Russian military forces on the island had short range nuclear weapons and were prepared to use them. Phew! That was close. Closer than we got again.	2005-06-08

But some might be called suicidal rather than dysfunctional. How does a child who starts being beaten when he is fifteen months old grow up to be even sane? How does a child grown up into manhood and break the only pattern he has seen while growing up?  <br /> <br />Perhaps the answer comes when you see the photograph of the author first holding his own new born son in his arms. He says, \\"The moment I held Eli in my arms, I knew I could never hurt him the way that my father hurt me.\\" The day you first hold your own new born is a kind of magic day in your life. I remember it well.  <br /> <br />This is a story of great sadness. This is a story that happens all too often. And all too often the cycle of violence continues from one generation to another. This is also a story of great triumph as the author preports on how he managed to overcome a childhood from hell. This part of the story doesn't happen often enough, it's glorous when it does.	2005-06-08

In reality, this is a business anyone can enter. There are no licensensing or special educational requirements.  <br /> <br />In reality though, it isn't all that easy. How do you get started? How do you first find a promising young star and second, convince him that you can do as good a job as one of the bigger, much better known agencies? How do you even go about convincing the young athelete that you can do a better job for him than he can do for himself, and save your fees?  <br /> <br />This is the story of Matt Sosnick, a west coast businessman who decides to change his career from the high tech industry to being a sports agent. For several months the author a baseball insider worked with Mr. Sosnick, watching, following him around the country to provide the first real insiders view of the glamorous world of the sports agent. After reading the book, you come to believe that it's not so glamerous after all. It looks like a lot of hard work. <br /> <br />Filled with insider details, this is a very interesting book.	2005-06-08

The Visual Quickstart Guides have a format where each page is divided into two columns with one column showing what you see on the screen and the other column having text that explains what's going on and what you need to do. A few such pages are then used to cover a small topic within the chapters. The small topic is self contained, easy to identify and makes a nice little mini-less all by itself. A good index leads you to this mini-lesson if you are looking for just that one thing.  <br /> <br />In this book, the tried and proven approach is used to give an excellent beginning leven introduction to GarageBand 2. GarageBand 2, just introduced at MacWorld 2005, is \\"music software for the rest of us.\\" Basically this one program, included free with iLife, enables the Mac to do the work of what used to take a whole room full of equipment.  <br /> <br />GarageBand 2 does not come with a manual. You can, you are supposed to, learn about it by experimentation. Reading a coordinated book like this one gives you an overview that covers the entire program rather than a hit and miss approach that sometimes lets you miss things.  <br /> <br />This is not your typical giant sized computer book.

If you're just getting started, I'd suggest you first get After Effects 6.5 for Windows and Macintosh: Visual QuickPro Guide. That will get you up and started quickly. What this book is for is to take you to the next level. It presules that you know your way around the After Effects workspace, if you've gone out to buy a bigger monitor just so you can open more Windows and palettes then you're ready for this book.  <br /> <br />After Effects is a heavy duty package. It is fully capable of producing professional quality big screen work. The key is to use the software with which you are most familiar because that way you can get the effect you want with the minimal amount of time expended. Reaching this level is mostly practice and hours spent in front of the screen.  <br /> <br />The hard part is looking at the image and deciding what needs to be done. And the only way this can be done is by showing before and after photographs of scenes and clips. This book has a lot of those.  <br /> <br />The CD included with the book contains a demo version of After Effects 6.5 that can be used for training. It also has several plug-ins and footage to use in the lessons.  <br /> <br />Published by Adobe, this is as close to being the official book as you can get.	2005-06-07

At the same time, some of the things he says are so one sided that they simply do not reflect an overall view. He writes with a seeming hatred for George Bush that trandsends logic.  <br /> <br />For instance, he talks about the weapons of mass destruction as though they were simply an excuse made up by Bush to justify what he wanted to do. There's an excellent article in the Jan/Feb 2004 issue of the Atlantic (available on line) by one of Clinton's foreign policy advisors. It says, in part, that every intelligence agency in the world: ours, British, French, German, Russian and on and on believed that Iraq had WMDs. It says that Clinton's administration even talked about invading, but lacked the political capital because of Monica.  <br /> <br />He talks about the mongol invasion of 1258 still affecting the memory of the people of Baghdad when faced with the invasion in 2003. Does he forget the Muslim invasion of Europe, the last Muslim fortress in Spain wasn't defeated until 1492, almost 250 years after the Mongols. How far do you want to go back?  <br /> <br />He says that we should treat the Israelies and Palestines more evenly. We live in a democracy. We have a lot of Jewish voters. This is the way it is. That's the way a democracy works.  <br /> <br />There's still one question to which I cannot find the answer: There was a time when the Arabs ruled the world. This was the center for culture, literature, medicine, science - we still use arabic numbers. What happened, why did they fall so far behind?	2005-06-07

John Babcock was a college student before the war. In the Army he was put into the Army Specialized Training Program. This program took smart guys and trained them for various professional jobs, usually giving them officer rank as well.  <br /> <br />Then after D-Day when combat really got started the Army began to realize that their carefully planned formations of men had everything in it from truck drivers, to supply clerks, to artillerymen (canon cockers), to everything else. But at the pointy end of the stick was the front line rifleman. And guess where the majority of the casualties were occurring.  <br /> <br />The author was pulled out of training one day, along with many thousand other young men, and all of a sudden was a rifleman. He got to Europe just in time for the Battle of the Bulge. Freezing in the European winter (In the infantry it is always too cold, or too hot, or too wet, or too dusty.) he learned the hard way what combat was like. His story, first written just after the war but bundled up for a half century has the ring of truth, and better yet, the ring of understanding.  <br /> <br />I particularily liked his story of getting promoted to Private First Class (PFC) after being in the Army for about a year and a half. I was finally promoted to PFC thirteen days before they would have had to write a letter explaining why not.	2005-06-07

In that society the separation of the genders was even more complete. This training procedure has been followed, not without some minor change for a couple of thousand years. And the change that has come in, has come in reluctantly on the part of the military. After all, the training procedure works. That's why it is still followed by nearly every army in the world.  <br /> <br />Ms. Burke chronicles the story well. She sees things from a female and folklorist point of view that is different that what I would see. She comes to two recognizable conclusions.  <br /> <br />First the American Military is dysfunctional. Yup! No doubt about that. And to think that this is the military that wins. Imagine what the others must be like. Go read Len Deighton's book \\"Blood, Tears and Folly\\" about the screw ups in World War II.  <br /> <br />Second, she would like to see a bunch of changes in the military. Yup! Let's change it. But let's change it slowly. Bad as it is, the current system has worked for a couple of thousand years. Be careful you don't produce something even more dysfunctional in an attempt to be politically correct. <br /> <br />Finally she talks about Jane Fonda. Yes, she's probably right about that too. I hear that her new movie is pretty good. It's undoubtedly silly, but I'm not going see Hanoi Jane in a movie.	2005-06-07

When first meeting with the realtor I said that I wanted a house where I could get broadband communications. I was the first person to put such a requirement on the purchase of a house. And it severely limited the number of houses available.  <br /> <br />Since then the situation in town has changed, but not much in the outlying areas. If you are line of sight of the mountain north of town you can use wireless. If you are in neighboring communities you can only get dialup service.  <br /> <br />This book defines those with the ability to get broadband service from those who cannot as being a 'digital divide.' Those without broadband are at a disadvantage when it comes to education, better jobs, and levels of civic participation.  <br /> <br />This book then looks into the problem of greater wideband access from the technical, legal, regulatory and economic aspects. The three editors have selected experts in each of these areas who have contributed papers on their specialties. There is no other book on the market that covers all of these aspects in the depths covered here. From an analysis of the telecommunications act of 1996 to FTTH (Fiber To The Home) it is all here. The concentration of effort here is on North America and Europe along with the more advanced Asian countries. There still isn't much hope for the third world where an ox-cart is the latest technology and fundamental needs such as electricity aren't even met.  <br /> <br />The book is intended for network engineers, planners, designers, researchers, students and academics, it suceeds well at its task.	2005-06-07

Also they worked with Christian Kennerney who runs a music shop selling top brands of Guitars.<br /><br />As always from Maran, the book is profusely illustrated with very high quality color photographs as well as graphics created specially for this book. Every aspect is covered from the history of the guitar to recording and mixing, even to repairing the Guitar.<br /><br />Unusual in a book on playing an instrument is the chapter on how to read music. This is not a generalized how to read music description, but is written specifically on how to read Guitar music.<br /><br />To go along with the book, there is a specialized web site that contains the MP3 files you will be taught. That way you get an example of the way that your playing should sound.<br /><br />This book is intended for beginners, and is the most complete introduction I've seen. This combined with the maran graphical treatment makes this an excellent way to start.	2005-06-06

The people who play poker up at this level live in a world that's simply different than any I've even heard of. In fact, I don't even understand the rules of the games well enough to understand what's happening.  <br /> <br />All that having been said, it's fascinating to read this book to see that such people exist, what they do, the nature of the game as they play it, and the various histories that they bring to the table.

So why did I get this book? Because I want a lot of this stuff in my delivery vehicles.  <br /> <br />I don't much care about a game console. Not true, I do care, I don't want it there. But a PC, a GPS, internet connection, and a printer make good sense. This would make a lot more sense than simply having people calling in all the time on their cell phones.  <br /> <br />One I liked about this book, was that it had all the information I needed from the technology, through installation, through the actual use. While I'm not going to do the installation myself, now I have a feeling of what the technician has to go through and I'm a lot less likely to get snowed by what he says.  <br /> <br />The first guy I talked to about doing this wanted to sell me an industrial grade PC for several thousand dollars. Instead the cases and other components discussed here tell me how to get the job done with a small fraction of the cost.  <br /> <br />The other thing that I liked about this book is that each project or device is separate and free standing. I didn't need to read about the audio visual system to find out what I needed to know about putting the PC in the vehicle.  <br /> <br />For me this book did exactly what I wanted.

My conclusion is that \\"No, they don't compete.\\" The basic rules are too different. Instead, what the guest chef cooks and what the author cooks are two different dishes. In looking over the recipies, sometimes I would prefer one, sometimes the other, often both sound like they would be good to eat --Example: A chef cooked Baked Stuffed Crab, Bittman cooked crab soup. Not the same disk, but I could handle either one but the baked one sounds better.<br /><br />This book is the companion to a series of TV shows where these \\"challenges\\" will be shown.

And the best paintings tried to paint life as it was. In the Mona Lisa, in the portraits of the time, at the roof of the Sistine Chapel the image was as near life like as could be painted. Then photography came in. With accurate pictures now available, the painters turned to the various kinds of abstracts.  <br /> <br />Now comes digital photography and powerful editing software that allows the creation of photographs of things that never were. These new images are produced from multiple photographs so carefully merged that they appear original, just of something that never was.  <br /> <br />Most of the images in this book are simply shown with a bit of text that describes what the artist was trying to do. With some others a series of intermediate steps are shown to show how the artist got to what was wanted.  <br /> <br />This is not a text on how to use Photoshop, instead it is an illustration of what can be done. Great Images.	2005-06-06

She had killed a half dozen people before she was caught and sentenced to life. She went to jail a dozen or more years ago. At the time there was a lot of comment that she should have gotten the death penalty. In fact, even after her death there were peole who said that she should have been put to death. I asked some of them why. She was locked up, she didn't hurt any more people, society was just as safe as if she had been killed, but we didn't kill her. They didn't have a good answer beyond \\"we just should have.\\"  <br /> <br />The United States is right up there with all the other progressive countries that allow the death penalty: North Korea, Iran, Iraq, China, Vietnam, most of Africa and the middle East. Notably missing from this list include England, Germany, France, Finland, most of the civilized countries.  <br /> <br />I don't know why, but I guess that I had hoped that with an issue so important that our Government, our legal system would be very careful and lean over backwards to execute only the worst of the worst. Why do we allow people to be executed because a piece of paper was filed a day late? Why do we execute people when there is any chance at all that they might not be guilty? Why do ask the state to make our society a little more violent than it already is.  <br /> <br />This is a sad book that makes compelling reading.	2005-06-06

The steady income from an investment portfolio provides a base that can sustain the existance of the non-profit during bad times.  <br /> <br />The techniques needed for obtaining endowment funding are quite different than those used to secure funds to answer immediate needs. The author has been a professional fundraiser for many years. Yet, when she started she was assigned a series of tasks including fundraising, a membership program, a volunteer corp, and \\"Oh yes, establish an endowment.\\"  <br /> <br />As she says, this is the book she wishes she had had to start her fundraising career. This is a combined how-to book and a how-to-think book. It talks of every aspect of endowment funding from what is an endowment to measuring the success of your efforts. Inbetween are stories of projects that have been conducted by successful fundraisers.  <br /> <br />There are very few books on endowments, this is the most recent and reflects the current state of the investment marketplace and what has been successful lately.	2005-06-06

But you've put it off. The books on XHTML and CSS are long and tedious, and written for beginners so they contain a lot of fluff that you already know.  <br /> <br />This book is different. It starts with the presumption that you are already an HTML programmer. In fact you are probably running a site that has a few hundred pages on line and you don't want to go redo the whole thing. This book starts with a fictional web site that uses good HTML 4.0 as was proper in the late 1990's. It's a typical site with lots of tables within tables as was the style of the day.  <br /> <br />The first thing that he does is go re-write the HTML into XHTML, removing the commands that handle the style of the presentation. Going to XHMTL is a pretty straightford thing, but without the style aspects you have a pretty dull page.  <br /> <br />Second he says let's use CSS to make the page pretty once again. Since you've seen the pages. And you've looked at the HTML that generated them, the task is a conversion, not a design the page problem. This probably matches your real problem a lot better than the way most books cover the subject.  <br /> <br />Third is the first word in the title: Accessible. There are now laws coming into effect that say a web site should be accessible to people with various disabilities. What does this mean, and how must you think about page design to make the site accessible?  <br /> <br />Finally there is a chapter on what's coming. The web is dynamic and the rules are still changing. This chapter covers the things that are being considered, designed, or discussed about in the committees that make the rules. This is what you will be having to learn next.	2005-06-05

In this one book Ms. Collier attemts to tell everything there is about settin yourself up in such a business. It's about as complete a book on the subject that could be written.  <br /> <br />My first advice is: \\"Before you sell, go buy some things.\\" She talks about finding things to buy using eBay's various search tools. She also gives out some of the little secrets such as searching on mispellings. For instance searching for \\"motherboard\\" right now finds 5328 entries. Leaving out the \\"a\\" and searching for \\"motherbord\\" finds five entries that aren't getting much action. One \\"motherbord\\" has two bids, one penny and six pennies.  <br /> <br />After that you're ready to sell things. This book is mostly on selling thing (check your spelling). And every aspect from signing up as a seller to getting payment (Paypal and other), to setting up your own store is included.  <br /> <br />The section on getting products to sell is as good as you could expect in a general book, but you're going to have to work this out yourself as you will need to specialize in something. What that specialty is doesn't much matter, but you've got to find some little niche of your own. That's got to include what will sell and where to get more at a good price. Don't get me wrong, her comments aren't incorrect, just generalized.	2005-06-05

I did exactly what he said when I was setting up my on-line business. The only thing was that this book didn't exist then and I had to learn it all one step at a time. Well, I guess that's the only way any of us learn anything.  <br /> <br />One thing he emphasises strongly and with which I cannot agree more, be a good e-mailer. If you get a question, a complaint, or anything else, respond quickly and in a friendly manner. Remember the old saying, \\"The customer is always right, even when he's wrong he's still right.\\"  <br /> <br />If you ship someone a bad CD (if that's what you're selling) and he comes bad and says it's bad, send him a new one immediately, before you even tell him to send you the old one back. Send it by first class mail, or even overnight. The rating he is likely to give you on e-Bay or Amazon or just with his friends is worth far more than the cost.  <br /> <br />One point I would emphasize stronger. Pick a niche in which to market. Amazon sells everything, but not REALLY everything. Specialty hobby products from rock climbing to clock making, specialty books like maybe I-10 from one end to the other (and if you publish this, Amazon might sell it for you). You must specialize in something, something you cna define in a short sentence, or may two.  <br /> <br />If you start an on-line business, remember that the web is only a communications medium. You're really just using the web to do what we used to call mail-order. This book emphasizes the on-line part of the business, just like the title says, you'll learn all this sooner or later, in this little book you'll have everything at your fingertips.	2005-06-05

It was taken over by the Government and made into an aerodrome. It was a fighter base, part of the defenses of London for almost fifty years. This book is a collection of photographs from in and around the air field, along with a small amount of text.  <br /> <br />Most of the pictures in the book is concerned with World War II. During that time it was a Spitfire base. Lots of pictures of the Spit in every situation imaginable from flying in formation to scattered around the countryside in pieces.  <br /> <br />This is kind of a specialized book, but I found it quite interesting. It shows a side of life during war time that you don't often see.	2005-06-05

Her life expectancy with this much burn was about 25%, unlikely to survive the first night. But she did. She was recovering until her body began destroying itself. The name of her condition is severe sepsis.  <br /> <br />Anyone with a child will shed tears as they read the struggles Janice's little body made against the infection and her own out of control immune system. But with Dr. Tracey this was a life changing experience as his experience with Janice's fight made him choose a life of scientific research into severe sepsis.  <br /> <br />The remaining third of the book talks about the research Dr. Tracey and his associates have conducted in the subsequent years and serves as a preliminary finding as to what they have discovered, the status of the research, and the hope for the future.	2005-06-05

However, I look at it a bit different. It's really about four books in one.  <br /> <br />Book 1 is the operating system itself. Specifically, it's about how to use the operating system as most users will use it, that is, through the Graphical User Interface of GUI. As such, you might think of Book 1 as being a book on Windows if you're familiar with the Microsoft world.  <br /> <br />Book 2 is on the applications that come with the basic operating system. OS X ships with a bunch of software. Not as much as with a typical Linux distribution but with more than comes with Windows. In Book 2 I would include things like surfing the web, networking the Apple, and things like that. You might combine this with Book 1 and say that there are only three books in this book. I don't mind if you do that, but I'm the one writing this review, and I put them separate.  <br /> <br />Book 3 is on hardware. It talks about adding all kinds of things to the Apple, from cameras and scanners to printers and tape drives. It even includes things like memory and disk drive upgrades.  <br /> <br />Finally, there's Book 4. This begins with the chapter ...And Unix Lurks Beneath. It tells you how to get to the underlying guts of the operating system. It is not a Unix book in its own right, but how to get to the familiar (or not so familiar) Unix things like vi and emacs and perhaps most important (for my needs) Apache. It isn't a book on Unix, but enough to serve as a bridge to a Unix book.  <br /> <br />There's a lot of material here, well presented. The MAC OS is easy to use, but there's a lot you won't find without a book like this one.	2005-06-05

Research is telling us more and more how the brain works. And as we learn more and more, a lot comes into conflict with what a lot of us want to believe. If evolution presented a crisis between the evolutionists and the creationists, wait until the raft of issues discussed here become more mainstream in the science textbooks.  <br /> <br />Starting off with a strong step into when is a fetus alive, he jumps quickly to stem cell research he asks some very interesting questions: \\"Does the mother of five, hiding from the Gestapo have the moral duty or right to smother the crying baby so the whole family will not be caught and shot?\\"  <br /> <br />The future offers the promise of many more such decisions in the future from \\"designer babies\\" to learning more that so called \\"free will\\" just may not exist at all.  <br /> <br />As we live in a time of growing religions fundamentalism, be it muslim or Christian, the future promises to be a most interesting place. This is a book that will make you think of many things in a different light.	2005-06-05

It includes not only operations against Russia, but also the covert operations during the Viet Nam war, operations against Cuba, etc.  <br /> <br />As I was reading this book I couldn't help but think of the older book \\"Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage\\" by Sherry Sontag, Christopher Drew, and Annette Lawrence Drew.  <br /> <br />I didn't realize just how close we and the Russians were going at each other during the Cold War. We are very, very lucky that some of these incidents didn't turn out to be really nasty.  <br /> <br />The one thing that I kept expecting in this book was more on the RB-47 intrusions into Russia during the late 1950's and early 1960's. It is my understanding that about 40 US planes were shot down with a loss of a couple of hundred men.  <br /> <br />One thing that I really liked about the book was the summary chapter at the end. His analysis of what we did, what the Russians were doing and the results were surprising and very informative. I'd like to see this part expanded another fifty pages or so in the next edition.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile it's still a great book, get it and \\"Blind Man's Bluff.\\"	2005-06-04

On the one hand we have the fundamentalist Christian right wing that would like to think that theirs is the dominant religion in the country. And on the other we have the fact that fewer and fewer people are attending church regularly.  <br /> <br />The left wing, seems to be ashamed to mention religion in any way. While again, most Americans report that they are not without faith of some kind.  <br /> <br />In this book the author goes looking for a faith on the part of the soldiers we have in the Middle East. Obviously he finds it. What I don't know, and can't determine from reading between the lines is any percentages, any numbers of the faithful vs. the non.  <br /> <br />Having written the book \\"The Faith of George W. Bush\\" this author seems to be seeking confirmation of his own thoughts. I find the book quite interesting, but am not so sure it is unbiased.	2005-06-04

What people wanted to steal from me was server time and bandwidth that I had to pay for. Inadvertantly I've distributed SPAM for this guy, current first run movies for that guy, just last week someone found a way to add his message to the newsletter we send out.

Virtually all teams are identical in capability, at least within their league. Great efforts are made to insure that small high schools play small high schools. They don't play grammar schools or NBA teams.  <br /> <br />As a result, the differences often come down to leadership. There's something that makes one coach consistently a winner. And John Wooden's record of 10 NCAA national championships in twelve years is nothing less than outstanding. That alone qualifies his thoughts on leadership to be worth noting.  <br /> <br />He breaks down the route to success into a pyramid of skills, attitudes and abilities.   This simplifies the understanding of what constitutes success and allows the route to success to be analyzed from many views. From this foundation Mr. Wooden outlines his principles for finding the champion in individuals and in teams.  <br /> <br />This book shows that in addition to knowing how to coach, Mr. Wooden knows how to write and how to move his views to a field broader than sports.	2005-06-03

That he can make a living doing what he loves, and that a major publishing company will publish a book like this on a fairly obscure subject is icing on the cake. Thank you Tim Gallagher. Thank you Houghton Mifflin Company.  <br /> <br />The book is well named. The second definition of grail is \\"the object of a prolonged endeavor.\\" And the search for the Ivory-billed Woodpecker certainly fits that description. The book was started as a way of permanently recording the reports of various sightings made in the 1930's and 40's. These sightings were treated with scorn and derision. Then in 2004 the author and another expert actually saw the bird. Since then, a massive search effort has resulted in some seven sightings being made. The bird lives.  <br /> <br />Birding has become a major hobby in the United States.

About the Laffite brothers we know little behond their helping Jackson defense of New Orleans fought after the treaty ending the War of 1812 (although the war was still on in New Orleans - the treaty went into effect at the speed of a sailing ship carrying the news).  <br /> <br />This was a time when the new nation of the United States was preoccupied with too many problems to take on policing of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. It was too far from Spain to be policed by them. So for a few years the corsairs could run wild. The Laffite brothers (Pierre was the older and the brains of the two, but Jean is more famous for some reason.) could operate for many years as pirates or privateers. Opportunist may be a better word, anything to make a living, with little regard for legalities, but more or less excluding working.  <br /> <br />This is supurbly researched well told tale of a time little studied.

One photograph in the book shows 80,000 people who paid more than a million dollars to watch a fight in an open field. And this was in 1921 when a million dollars had a lot more value than it does today.  <br /> <br />This is the background against which a perceived has been of boxing James Braddock managed to get a fight with the heavyweight champion Max Baer. Going in as a ten to one underdog, the conventional wisdom was that Braddock didn't stand a chance. As history shows, he won.  <br /> <br />This was a time when the individual sportsman reigned supreme. And of these boxing was the top of the heap. Boxers were at the top of society, perhaps just as a novelty, but invited to all the best parties, the best restaurants.  <br /> <br />Mr. Schaap has given us a view of the time, the people, the society of the time.

Salonica (or Thessaloniki as it is known today) is located at one of the crossroads of the world. It is Greek at the moment, but has at times been Turkish. As a crossroads it had strong Christian, Muslim and Jewish communities. It was not without conflict, but they lived together for centuries. Only in fairly modern times were the Muslims forced to leave, and during World War II the Germans rounded up the Jews as part of the final solution (which makes for tragic reading).  <br /> <br />This is an area far from the mainstream of most modern American history books. Most of our history comes from other areas of the world. So this book opens new areas to study for the first time. It is exhaustively researched and provides an insight into a world, a culture far from our own. For many years, this was considered the orient, where east meets west.  <br /> <br />A fascinating place, a fascinating read.	2005-06-03

This is not about clustered micro computers being used to work on big computational tasks as though it is a supercomputer.  <br /> <br />Clusters of customers is a key area in data mining and knowledge discovery. You are usually trying to find groups of people with similar buying patterns but not necessarily identical. For instance if you have a group of people that have purchased a book on PHP, you might want to try to sell them a book on MySQL, or Apache, or Linnux.  These programs fit together, but are not identical. Still the customer who purchased the PHP book is more likely to want a MySQL book than he is to want an audio CD of a murder mystery.  <br /> <br />In this book, two of the most popular clustering techniques, K-Means and Ward's Method are presented. They are presented for a reader interested in the technical aspects of data mining as a theoretician or a practitioner. It is intended (the author says) that the material be useful to a reader with no mathematical background beyond high school. But the author also says, it might be of help if the reader is acquainted with basic notions of calculus, statistics, matrix algebra, graph theory and logic. (The author went to a different high school than I).  <br /> <br />Clustering is described in this book to be used in a wide variety of applications, most of which are oriented to discovering social patterns, biological taxonomies, machine learning, etc. The book discusses the various techniques that have been developed and gives examples where they have been used in a wide variety of applications.	2005-06-02

Well, this is a James Patterson novel. There's murder most gruesome. There are clues aplenty -- some of them sending you in absolutely the wrong direction. There's a child paralyzed for life from a gunshot in a wheelchair with noisy assisted breathing (I can't help but think of Darth Vader). There's also a court scene where the hero in one set of murders is being tried for another murder -- have you got all that.  <br /> <br />In essense, this is the kind of mystery that mysteries were invented to be. It's not something that you can take too seriously. It allows you to escape from today's mundane problems. It lets you forget for a few hours that you're in the cramped center seat of an airplane.  <br /> <br />Great literature it isn't. A great read it is.	2005-06-02

In many ways you can't but agree with him. He claims that classical music in the United States peaked at about 1900 and that since then it has been falling in impact, in quality, and in just about every other way.  <br /> <br />I'm not so sure that I completely agree. One of his points is that American orchestras have become fixated on performing only the music of the old masters and ignoring American composers. In fact he says that at the turn fo the century we were waiting for a major American composer to come in and set the stage for the new country. And that didn't happen.  <br /> <br />Music has certainly changed in the last hundre years, but there are more symphanies than ever before. Even the smaller cities like Salt Lake city, San Jose, etc. sport local orchestras. Performances at places like Vail, Colorado and Tanglewood draw good crowds.  <br /> <br />I think that there may be a discussion waiting to happen on what is classical music. Shakespeare is certainly classical literature, but it was theater of the masses in its day. Musicals on Broadway, movie themes like John Williams work on Star Wars aren't defined as classical. But in a hundred years Phantom of the Opera may well be considered classical.  <br /> <br />Mr. Horowitz certainly raises interesting points, and has crafted a book well worth reading.	2005-06-02

It is basically an analysis of research involving advertisements, brands, customers, and sales reps. The format is basically a series of little two page points. The left hand page is labeled \\"Scientific Advice\\" and the right hand is \\"Practical Ideas.\\"  <br /> <br />A lot of these are the old standbys like: KISS, Keep it Simple Stupid. Make your message so a ten year old can understand it. But even the old standbys need to be thought over every once in a while.  <br /> <br />And some of the scientific advice directly contradicts the old message. Selling the sizzle rather than the steak for instance is often a mistake. And he gives the evidence to prove it.  <br /> <br />Most of the messages seem to me to be more concerned with a smaller company, even a start-up rather than a giant operation. There's more on selling new widgets rather than convincing people to buy Coke rather than Pepsi.  <br /> <br />An inexpensive little book, even one idea for your next marketing project will cover its cost many times over, and I got much more than one idea out of it.	2005-06-02

It's hard to imagine that newspapers would treat the crossing the Atlantic times as events to be covered as headline news.  <br /> <br />But it is true. The years from 1889 when Kaiser Wilhelm II declared that he would \\"seize the trident\\" from the British up until World War I was a period of time when the civilizations of the world pushed technology and luxury to the limits. Even minor inconveniences like the Titanic running too fast for safety with fatal consequences provided only a short interruption.  <br /> <br />Strange also was the way the era came to an end. With the outbreak of war the German liners were taken over by the allies and used to transport American troops to fight against Germany.  <br /> <br />This book is a delightful history of the time and well worth reading. I'd just like to see another couple or three chapters. One would be on the times between the world wars. And another on the attempt after the war to return to the great age of ship travel with ships like the United States and Andrea Doria. Perhaps a final chapter on the modern cruise ships, at 70,000+ tons, these dwarf the ships from the Superliner Era, and they just go around in circles.	2005-06-02

This book is based on information from the OSS archives that was finally released in 2000. It tells a story that was simply unknown before.  <br /> <br />Fritz Kolbe was a walk in. One day he walked in to the OSS office in Switzerland and offered to spy on Germany. Both the British and the Americans were very concerned that he was a double agent. Eventually though Allen Dulles, then head of the OSS in Switzerland took a chance with him.  <br /> <br />Kolbe was a medium level officer in the German foreign office. He was not a Nazi and became disenchanted with the Nazi regime. All in all he passed some 2,600 secret documents to the OSS.  <br /> <br />After the war Kolbe wanted to continut working for the German Foreign Office. But the Nazi officials who had by then re-entered the German government considered him a traitor and refused to employ him.  <br /> <br />The CD is read by Michael Prichard, who has recorded some 430 full length books.	2005-06-02

Rarely have I heard so many words spoken that had so little meaning. All of those guys were truly expert in answering questions with a bunch of words that said nothing that could possibly offend.  <br /> <br />It is unlikely that this book will change the way they talk. Politicians, corporations, news media and the rest have learned how to talk without communicating. After all, if you say anything, it cna't help but offend someone. Taken out of the context in which they were intend, it is certainly funny to see the words that the author uses to illustrate his points.  <br /> <br />One point that he doesn't mention is the growth of paper written by non-English speakers. You see this often in instructions on products made in the far East. How can anyone plan to sell a product in the English speaking world and not convert the writing from Chinglish or Japlish.

No, you can't use any other brand of corn chips, Frito's. Over the top pour a layer of chili without beans, yes, without beans. Then chopped onions and grated cheese. Cook in the oven until the cheese bubbles. I was taught to make two layers of all this. Her family apparently used one.  <br /> <br />But this book is only partly a cookbook. It's a series of little stories she reports on her life, combined with a bit of wisdom on how to look at the future.  <br /> <br />She's a bright lady, who lived her life to the fullest (and is still going strong), and she did it her way, just like in the song.

And this is time that is in the two to three dollar minute category. What I find that this book does is enable the small businessman to save attorney time.  <br /> <br />If you want to start a business, learn about LLC's (Limited Liability Corporations), and S-Corporations (Corporations formed under subchpter S of the IRS code) and others before you go see the lawyer. When you get to the lawyer, say I want you to form a \\"whatever you want\\" type corporation, it's name should be \\"whatever you've picked,\\" the directors are \\"A, B, and C.\\" And have this written down. If you tell the lawyer these same points, he will have to write them down at dollars per minute. <br /> <br />What this book does, is give you the background to save an awful lot of attorney time. Think of the cost of the book as being eight or ten minutes of attorney time.  <br /> <br />One thing that I'd emphasize a bit stronger than was brought out in the book is find and register a web domain name and make it the business name. The book tells you about checking on domain names, I'd just suggest that you combine this with the business name.  <br /> <br />One more thing, he suggests you go to [...] to check on domain names. That's fine. But for registering the name, Network Solutions charges $35 a year. [...] will also let you check on name availability at no charge and then only charges $8.95 a year for the registration.	2005-06-01

There is little of earth shattering importance here, just enough to make you chuckle a bit and make life better than it was.  <br /> <br />Perhaps my favorite was her learning how to pray -- she was teaching her teenage son how to drive a pickup truck with a manual transmission. Oh how I remember those days.  <br /> <br />If you're under forty something, if you haven't been married, if you don't have any kids -- you simply won't understand.

After all, the author had done all the work, the translator merely took the written word and converted it, almost word for word into the new language.  <br /> <br />It is only as I have grown older that I realize that the meaning behind the words or between the lines is as important as the words themselves. It is a skill all its own to take the writing of someone else and faithfully produce a new work with a meaning as close as possible to what the original author was trying to say.  <br /> <br />This is compounded when the setting of the original work is so different than that of the intended reader. For instance the Spanish heritage in Latin America being translated to the world of the United States. Every aspect from life, from the law, from the history needs to be considered.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the untimate compliment comes to the translator when the author says that the translation is better than the original - as Garcia Marquez has said of his book \\"One Hundred Years\\" as translated by Gregory Rabassa.	2005-05-31

I was still thinking as a GI.  <br /> <br />Here you have a bunch of troops, generally speaking not from the higher rankings of society. They are wearing uniforms (which gives you a strange feeling anyway). They are carrying loaded rifles.  <br /> <br />There you have a bunch of students, generally speaking they are from the higher rankings of society. The students are taunting the troops, throwing rocks at them, screaming four letter words at them.  <br /> <br />As Mr. Caputo says, \\"to respond to stones and bad language with a random volley of .30-caliber bullets was not imaginable in America.\\" But that's what happened, Kent State made it imaginable.  <br /> <br />There are several real lessons to be learned by Kent State. One is that you shouldn't go throwing stones and curse words at people who don't like you very well anyway and who have loaded rifles. Another is that if you're in charge you don't put soldiers trained how to act in combat in such a role. Finally you start doing some research in conflict resolution, like the new center at Kent State.  <br /> <br />This book is a complete story of the incident. It also incorporates some very good analysis of the aftermath. In 2003 the demonstrations against the war in Iraq happened with no bloodshed. Highly recommended.	2005-05-31

Except for the special case of arbitrage, investing is really placing a bet on the future. And it's pretty hard to play in the arbitrage business because there are an awful lot of very smart people with very big computers already doing that.     The next thing that I noticed was the long list of web sites given in the contents. The amount of information available on the web is truly amazing, so much that just knowing where to look is difficult. Here is an extensive list along with some description of what to find there. Most of the investment books around haven't yet cought up to the fact that the web exists.     Finally I noticed the section on Technical Analysis. This is the first book I've seen that discusses this in simple enough terms that the average investor (I consider myself average) can make sense out of it. Most books on the subject turn out to be statistics texts.     In short, this book is intended to take the average investor and make him a more knowledgable investor, more \\"Astute.\\" Dr. Prentis is trying to make the average investor a bit smarter, a bit more able to understand the investment world and how the big guys operate.

It reminded me a lot of the British calling the American forces during the Revolutionary War cowards because they wouldn't stand up in straight lines and shoot at each other, instead they hid behind trees to make it harder to be hit.  <br /> <br />Whatever else they were, these nineteen young men were not cowards. A coward is not going to deliberately crash an airplane into a building knowing it would cost his life.  <br /> <br />In this book gives us a careful look at these men. Mostly middle class, generally well educated, from families no more dysfunctional than average, the hijackers became convinced that they were soldiers of God, chosen to do his bidding. How they were converted to radical fundamental Islam is perhaps not so different than what is happening in this country with the fundamental Christians who blow up abortion clinics.  <br /> <br />The conclusion in the book is that finding such soldiers to perform other terrorist activities in the future. Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be wrong. Suicide bombers and Japanese Kamikaze pilots seem fairly easy to find.  <br /> <br />Frightening book, that we can only hope does not fortell the future.	2005-05-30

Having been through both, that's not a bad saying. And this book will give some idea of the things you can expect to happen during remodelling.  <br /> <br />This is not a book on how to remodel. It's a book about when, where and what to remodel. It's about permits and contractors. It's about what a remodel will gain you when you sell the house. It's about the real world, not the world you see on the remodelling shows on television. It's about what you can do yourself, and what you want to get done (unless of course you're an expert).  <br /> <br />This is not a big book, and it isn't expensive. Before you even think about getting started on the big project buy it and read it carefully.	2005-05-29

This book is a series of papers describing the ethical and social issues this raises. A second theme is a discussion of the quality of life for disable persons.  <br /> <br />This book came from a working group that the editors convened. Papers were presented on the subject, and then afterwards they were revised in light of the deliberations at the conference. The contents range from the social contract under which we all live to the right of the individual woman to terminate a pregnancy for any reason what so ever (as defined by Roe v. Wade).	2005-05-29

It's a modest little place on Charlotte Street in London ([...] If you are familiar with Charlotte Street you know what that means. It's a small, short street where you find one modest little place after another that have to rank among the best restaurants in the world. It's London's equivalent to Restaurant Row on West 46th Street in New York.  <br /> <br />\\"Passione\\" fits that bill perfectly. It won the award as the best Italian restaurant in London in 2005.  <br /> <br />I haven't tried all the recipies, that will take me a long time. But his recipies featuring polenta provide a couple of new variations on what mother used to make. But being in the south we called it grits instead. I must also say that his comments on using old fashioned grits rather than the new quick grits (taste kind of like library white paste) are exactly right. I'd even suggest that you spend some effort to find the coarse ground yellow grits done by people like Bob's Red Mill in Oregon or the Old Mill of Guilford in NC.  <br /> <br />The other recipies I've tried are equally excellent. Tonight I'm going to do the king prawns with garlic and chili. His recipie is close to one that I've used before, but with a couple of new items that sound like they would make an interesting taste.  <br /> <br />The best thing I can say about a cookbook is that this is one that I use.	2005-05-29

(It was even more of a surprise when it was discovered that this was a strain developed by the U.S. Army and ordered destroyed. But that's another matter that hasn't been discussed much outside the Government. I suspect that there has been considerable discussion inside the Government, at least I hope so.)  <br /> <br />The contaminated mail was treated with ionizing radiation to kill the spores. It was fortunate that the incident occurred in Washington D.C., which was basically the home town of many of the American organizations working this area.  <br /> <br />Subsequently a conference was held by NATO on using radiation to inactivate such materials. This conference covered the state of the art in facilities, equipment, the sensitivity of the microorganisms, and much more. This book is a reprint of twenty two papers presented at the conference.  <br /> <br />The technical papers presented in this book are by authors from all around the world, including severalon the United States Government efforts in the 2001 attack and an investigation into using irradiation on High-Risk luggage on airlines and other potential threat areas.	2005-05-29

The new leader will be a prince with a more fundamental muslim outlook. This story really has two parts.  <br /> <br />First is the actions of the good guys and the bad guys. And here Mr. Robinson does quite well. We have met both of them in previous books, General Ravi Rashood, the head of the Hamas organization and Admiral Arnold Morgan have met in previous books and have an ongoing relationship not unlike Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarity.  <br /> <br />But second, there is the underlying tone of what would happen to the world oil marketplace if Saudi Arabia stopped shipping oil? As I write this the price of oil went to a new interday high last week (it seems that this could happen nearly any week). And this happened with no dramatic news like the sudden shortage that would happen if Saudi oil stopped flowing.  <br /> <br />This book is, of course, fiction. But a good writer has to come up with a story that is at least possible. And Mr. Robinson has done an excellent job with this one.	2005-05-29

Second, I recommend that you don't do what the title says.  <br /> <br />Use this book as a guide to do as much of the work as possible before you go to a professional. That will save you a lot of time, and this is lawyer time at a bunch of dollars an hour. You're going to have to be the one producing much of this paperwork anyway, but if you can present it to the professional at the beginning it will save him having to educate you.  <br /> <br />Read the book carefully. For instance the first thing that the patent office will send you after you file the applications (in a year or two -- yes, a year or two) is the \\"first Office Action\\" or \\"OA.\\" It will turn down your application.  <br /> <br />It seems that the PTO rejects the first application on general principles just to see if you're serious about applying for a patent. I don't expect this is a written rule, but it's the real rule. This book says it slightly differently, \\"rarely will an application be allowed in the first OA.\\" I think \\"Damn Rarely\\" would be better wording, like the last time was in 1906. That's probably not true, but close.  <br /> <br />You can probably use this book to get a patent. But if that patent ever went to court, it had better be worded exactly as the court wants it or you can find it thrown out.	2005-05-29

Every time I pick up one, I find something that I find useful that I never knew about before.  <br /> <br />When I first picked up this book and started thumbing through it I found Hot Tip #49. It is named \\"Quickly shut down Windows with a souble-click.\\" How come I didn't know this before? It is certainly something that I can use. I find clicking Start (Ignoring that Start shouldn't mean Stop), then clicking on Turn Off Computer, and then having to confirm that yes, this is really what I want to do to be a drag.  <br /> <br />This tip, like all the others in the book uses the famous Maran full-color illustrated approach to tell how to do it. I did it on my computer, and everything looked exactly like their illustrations, it took about a minute, and now there's a shortcut named ShutDown on my desktop.  <br /> <br />There are a hundred and one such hot tips in this book. Many, like \\"Customize the Mouse for Left-Handed Users,\\" don't interest me.  <br /> <br />All in all, I set up a handful of things following their directions, and there is another handful that I'm thinking about. What more can you expect out of a little, inexpensive book like this one?	2005-05-28

Still, I've never thought of them as \\"THEM.\\"  <br /> <br />That their daughter turned out as well as she did should also teach us something, but I'm not so sure just what. But it's interesting that the writing about \\"Them\\" seems honest about both the good and bad sides of her parents personalities. \\"Them\\" are treated with love and respect, but also with both eyes open to their weaknesses as well as their towering strengths.  <br /> <br />You do get the feeling that Francine felt that here parents were ignoring her.

Contrast this with learning to do something like \\"Flight Simulator.\\"  Or look how fast the kids pick up the new, rather complex game.  <br /> <br />\\"Formal\\" education began with a teacher taking a handful students to instruct on the way of the world.

I was put on a bus at some ridiculous hour like 3 or 4 in the morning. After a few hours on the bus we were let off in front of huge building with the words, \\"Go find the sign that says where you are going and wait under the sign.\\"  <br /> <br />There was no sign for where I was going. With great trepidation I went to find a sargeant and asked, \\"Where's my sign.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"You're not supposed to be here for another twelve hours, what are you doing here so early?\\"  <br /> <br />What I wanted to say was that I was calmly asleep when some sargeant started yelling at me to get up, get dressed and get on this stupid bus that took me to here.  <br /> <br />But I didn't think that that was wise, I don't remember just what I said. Anyway I was told to come back in twelve hours. I left there quickly.  <br /> <br />In World War II German prisoners were taken to a large room and told to go stand under the sign of the unit to which they were assigned. If they couldn't find a sign they eventually went to a sargeant and asked. The sargeant would make a new sign for his unit. And the Army would then know that a new unit had been moved onto the battlefield. Something important for the Army to know, and something the soldiers had been told not to tell -- name, rank and serial number remember.  <br /> <br />Here are the rules, and no, they do not include flushing the Qur'an down the toilet.	2005-05-27

The first one is usually that you can't find the file you are seeking. You product something, you save it, and pretty soon your directory is full of files with strange names and you can't quite remember just what they are. That's the sort of thing that the authors of this book tell you how to fix.  <br /> <br />Eventually most of us have to learn these little tasks, but here in one book, you get a concise and complete list and description of all these little things that you should do every so often.

It makes for very good reading not only to learn what was happening, but to understand what makes stories newsworthy.  <br /> <br />At one point Edward R. Murrow went to visit Belsen camp. He did not write a story about, he said, \\"I am an American reporter for the American public, and I cannot go north to talk about the British occupying a camp.\\" One of the things that journalists are taught is to provide what their readers want to read. Murrow's readers wanted to read about what the American Army, their sons were doing.\\" That says \\"talk about the Bataan Death March, not the Holocaust.\\"  <br /> <br />This book causes me to think a lot about the situation at the time and about publishing in general. Right now the respect of the average American for the press is pretty low, probably right down there with respect for Congress.  <br /> <br />This book has a story to tell. But it's telling the story in retrospect. We now have access to a lot of facts that were collected one at a time over years. Now we can see the big picture that allows us to pull out those facts that may have been invisible at the time. This is not unlike the facts that should have warned us in advance about Pearl Harbour.  <br /> <br />The book certainly makes for interesting reading. And the anti-liberal media people will have a blast with it.	2005-05-27

As the head of the Army Materiel Command, he had 100,000 people working for him to supply the worldwide needs of the Army. ==In this book he discusses every aspect of logistics support for the Army of today and tomorrow. This includes equipment, many of it specialized such as transport ships that can conveniently carry armored vehicles at a high speed. These are not the same requirements as that of the commercial market. But it also includes using commercial equipment or companies when possible so that cost advantages can be obtained.  <br /> <br />Each major area of logistics is examined from the timely delivery of mail from home to evacuating casualties from the battlefield. The books examines the effect of the information explosion and looks into new technologies that are coming into being.  <br /> <br />This is the first major book to be published in forty years or so.

The Army spent years thinking about, planning for, buying equipment for fighting the Russian Army coming through the Fulda Gap in Germany. Then they had to learn about fighting in jungle. Then they fought some in desert. Now all of a sudden they are getting killed one or two at a time fighting while trying to patrol a city.  <br /> <br />In a city there isn't much need for the Abrams tank. But a Humvee isn't enough. The new Stryker armored vehicle that the Army is just now fielding used a new concept in armor for the Army ([...]) - although not for the Marines which have been purchasing this vehicle under the name LAV (Light Armored Vehnicle).  <br /> <br />Equipment is just one of the points covered in this book which is a survey of current thinking from around the world.

Not understanding much about shooting the big guns he was happy to volunteer for a \\"hazardous duty behind enemy lines.\\"  <br /> <br />He didn't know that he was volumteering for the OSS. But he was, and he was accepted and began training. He was young, it was an exciting time. And then he was sent to the Med for a variety of jobs, at which he says he was woefully unprepared.  <br /> <br />The United States had no intelligence operations before the war. They had to build one from scratch. They did.  <br /> <br />Written in a very humorous style, this book has the ring of truth, with some strong hints of Mr. Roberts. Dr. Kloman makes it clear that he fought a pretty good war. Safe, well behind the front lines, he writes with an entertaining and amusing tilt. It's only in reading between the lines that you realize that they were doing pretty good stuff.  <br /> <br />As a war rememberance this is not as important as say Ike's \\"Crusade in Europe.\\" But it is a pretty good story of a young man.

She had spent the war on the East Coast of the United States doing rescue work, patrolling, and other tasks. Her last job was towing a target for dive bombers out to sea. Sitting dead still in the water a massive explosion occurred mid-ship and blew the \\"Eagle\\" into two parts. Forty nine of her crew were killed, either immediately or from emersion in the frigid spring waters off Maine.  <br /> <br />The Navy ruled that the explosion was an accidental boiler explosion. This was in spite of some of the crew reporting that they had seen a submarine surface just after the attack. The \\"Eagle\\" was the last American warship sunk by a German U-boat. A few days later the Navy changed their ruling to \\"undetermined causes.\\" And there the matter remained for forty seven years.  <br /> <br />Paul M. Lawton was convinced that the Navy was wrong and patiently worked (a little at a time) for forty seven years to collect evidence that the Navy ruling was wrong. He was finally vindicated when various previously classified documents were released, and the knowledge of the U-853 came out. Finally the Navy changed its finding that the \\"Eagle\\" was lost \\"due to enemy action.\\"  <br /> <br />This is the story of Paul Lawton's quest.

Looking at what he did, there is no question that he was a very bright fellow. He couldn't have done all that he did otherwise. He was also very dedicated. He lived and breathed rockets. He started working with rockets very early and kept at it all through his life.  <br /> <br />But just think how lucky he was. Had he been born earlier (like Goddard) there were no rocket programs. Had he been born later, say he turned 16 or 17 in 1944, it is likely that he would have been cannon fodder on the eastern front. Had he been fascinated by any of a hundred other subjects: machine guns, aircraft engines, submarines or whatever, he would have been just another member of the Nazi party and the SS. Rather than a trip to the US as a \\"Special Employee\\" of the US Army, it is likely that he would have a trip to prison instead.

After all, the people who major in journalism are liberal arts majors. Dan Rather and the like are not physicists or computer scientists. Indeed if he were, he would have looked at a supposedly typewritten document from long ago and noticed that there were superscripts. Superscripts are easy to do with Microsoft Word and ink jet printers. But you didn't do them thirty years ago with military typewriters. But what can you expect of a liberal?  <br /> <br />As for the national news, I'm not so sure that they have been defeated by the conservatives so much as having self destructed. I watch any of the three (four if you count CNN) and I don't see much liberal bias. After all, you have to report on things like the news if you spend all of your time on the trivia that they seem to consider the important stories of the day.  <br /> <br />I mean, we have real problems to talk about, who really cares if some guy in California killed his wife. That happens all the time? There is nothing magic to draw me to Scott Peterson. Who really cares about a nutty pop singer who somehow gets young boys to come visit? If you are going to show only such fluff, how can you be accused of having any bias at all? They are entertainment shows, not news.  <br /> <br />This book talks about the growth of the conservative media: talk radio, Fox News, and the internet Blogs. It's interesting to see, but as of yet, the big networks and CNN still dominate the airwaves, and the big newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post still have tremendous readership and influence.  <br /> <br />The future's not ours to see, will the big media recover, will the \\"rebel\\" conservative press grow to dominance, will electronic media grow to match the traditional? Let's keep watching.	2005-05-26

When you first start working with digital photographs, that is beyond the shoot and store on hard disk, you wind up working with Photoshop. And when you start working with Photoshop, you are faced with a bewildering assortment of things that you can do. You're going to spend lots of time with your computer. If you're like most of us, you will try this and that, and eventually find that you can spend an enormous amount of time manipulating an image. Some of the things produce dramatic impact, many do not.  <br /> <br />Most people want to go shoot pictures and not spend too much time staring at a computer. This book is about applying some organization to using Photoshop. If you follow a procedure to first look at your pictures, then decide what to do and in what order, you can get better pictures faster, leaving more time to go shoot more.  <br /> <br />This book is about all of these steps. It is a mixture of what to do to an image (it is not a how to do it, that's a Photoshop book), in what order, and how to wind up with a spectacular picture quickly.  <br /> <br />This is a different concept from any of the Photoshop books I've read.	2005-05-26

Obviously they bring their religion with them, yet at the same time they live in the west and generally have adopted Western ways.<br /><br />Intermixed with this is discussion on the more radical elements of Muslim people. He especially talks a lot about Ben Ladin and other armed groups such as Palestinians, Chechens, the Balkans and others. He appears to view them as only the radical fringe.<br /><br />When he talks about Christians, he generalizes, ignoring the radical fundamental fringe in the United States that blows up abortion clinics; and the conflict in Northern Ireland. This may well be due to his being French and living in Europe.<br /><br />The points he makes are sometimes difficult to understand, but that may well be because of the language. I'd hate to have someone review a book I'd written in French.	2005-05-26

From being just a dream a few years ago, now the hardware and software is available to make the dream come true. It's not quite to the point of where you think of Cisco as you phone company, but it's getting there.  <br /> <br />This book concentrates on the lower end of the Cisco equipment, for small stand alone or corporate branch offices. It is aimed at the small business owner, the manager in the big organization responsible for remote communications, and to the reseller interested in expanding his offerings to his business customers.  <br /> <br />There are a lot of different Cisco hardware products in a range from very small to bigger systems. The first part of the book talks about these various products, including both the switch and the telephones themselves.  <br /> <br />Most of the book, however is on how to use the software that makes it all work. This software is Windows based, and for the most part can be administered from a remote terminal. Because it is so powerful and capable of so many things, there are a lot of screens to work with. As you would expect, there is also a good bit of background theory and troubleshooting information. Basically everything you need to know about ordering, setting up and operating a system.	2005-05-25

They talk mostly about the use of IP devices in truly mobile, as in moving around. This includes not only the commonly known devices such as Palms or BlackBerries, but also specialized devices installed in delivery trucks, police, ambulances, fire trucks. Furthermore, there is a very defined need for devices using Mobile IP Technology in semi-permanent locations. This includes applications such as ATM machines and gas pumps. These devices are much easier to install and maintain if they communicate wirelessly.  <br /> <br />Still, regardless of the application, the technologies discussed in this book apply. Here the basic communications protocols and techniques that are used. It is an excellent summary of the way that IP traffic is handled in a wireless environment.	2005-05-25

After all, it was just a concept where scientists could exchange papers. Even if you would have told the original developers where it was going to go they would have just laughed at you.  <br /> <br />Anyway, Snort is another tool in stopping the bad guys from coming into your system. In particular it is an intrusion detector. Note the word detector. Snort monitors your system to see what's happening. It is not an anti-virus like program that detects, quarantines, deletes, etc. an infected file. Instead it watches what is going on in the system and looks for behavior that is outside the rules.  <br /> <br />Snort watches, records and reports on what the systems in you network might be doing. On a big network, running Snort could well be a full time job. It can produce volumes of information. Some of this information regarding your employees might be considered spying on them, there are also some words (a few more wouldn't hurt) on what you can do to outsiders vs. your own people.	2005-05-25

But that was because of the publicity that was high at the time regarding who actually shot him.

The author works for Cisco and has contributed questions to the exam. He has a pretty good idea of what you need to know.  <br /> <br />I really like the way he starts each chapter with a little \\"Do I Know This Already?\\" Quiz. If you know the material in the chapter pretty well, why spend a lot of precious time going over it again. Instead, you can spend your time more wisely on those points where you need more study.  <br /> <br />The security of networks has become ever more important as more and more people seem to want to hide behind anonymity of the web and for thrill, pleasure, or profit disrupt your system. The demand for security specialists is large and growing. As of today, there are only 473 certified security CCIEs.  <br /> <br />In addition to the standard review type material, this book also contains a CD-ROM with over 500 simulated test questions which allows you to take the sample exam as many times as you like until you are comfortable with the test procedures and your knowledge level.  <br /> <br />The security exam is not easy, and it's just the first step. After you pass the written part, you are ready for the lab part. While this book concentrates on the written exam, Appendix C & D gives you some idea of the level of the tasks involved.  <br /> <br />All in all, this is probably as complete an exam guide as you will find.	2005-05-25

In this book he is on the destroyer Tuareg operating in the Eastern Med. This is still early in the war, and the British flotilla is facing the might of the German Luftwaffe. Then the order comes to make one more trip into Crete.  <br /> <br />Mr. Fullerton has done a supurb job of developing this new naval series. This series has the spirit of the Horatio Hornblower and Jack Aubrey series, but it is set instead in the world of World War II. The author served with distinction as a submarine officer in the British Royal Navy. It is clear that he knows whereof he speaks, and his writing skills are up there with the best.	2005-05-25

The author was a young girl of ten at that time. This is the story of her life after her fathers arrest and execution. Obviously well to do at the time, the two daughters were sent to school in Austria, and finally to an uncle in America.  <br /> <br />As part of this, I am reminded that when people move to the United States, they often become the best, most capable citizens we have. In this family of four children there are two doctors and two lawyers. Often, usually, the people who leave a country are the best people that that country has. Our country is benefitted by their being here.  <br /> <br />Finally, this is the story of how an Islamic government moving into power. At one time the author's mother is showing hospital records to the jailer, and is told that it doesn't matter what proof she has, the decision stands and he will be executed. Not too different, I guess, than the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, but a pretty rough way to life. And this is what people say they want???	2005-05-25

My own results will (usually) please the ones doing the eating, but they sure aren't going to look this good.  <br /> <br />I notice in the opening of the book she refers to her creative team to set a mood, set a table, accessorize it, and given us room for inspiration. I guess that's it. I don't have a creative team. I notice a couple of times she covers the table with something for her husband. Yes, it looks great, but the old man probably wouldn't notice any difference if it were covered with yesterday's newspaper.  <br /> <br />But what you really want out of a cookbook is the recipies. And what you really look for in recipies is something that sounds good, but which you are probably going to just use as a place to start as you add/subtract things that you like better. And I've got to say, I got some great ideas here. I have tried everything I want to use, but I will.	2005-05-25

This is a new translation, presented side by side with the original Hebrew with Rashi's commentary given in both English and Hebrew as well. In addition, alternate forms of translation are given to reflect that many words can be accurately translated in more than one way.<br /><br />Virtually every student of Torah, from the child in elementary school to the gadol/hador,no matter what area of Torah he studies, refers to Rashi. As a simple wine merchant Rashi accepted no rabbinic position. He died in 4865 (1105 CE), but his awe-inspiring works have ensured that in a deeper sense, he will live on forever.	2005-05-25

In this case the subject is the Computer Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) Network+ test. The book contains little that isn't needed for the test and includes a CD-ROM with a practice exam, flashcards (if you prefer to use them), and a glossary. It's a rather small book (compared to the giant size computer books normally seen). The chapters are arranged in the same format as the test, four major sections: Media and Topologies, Protocols and Standards, Network Implementation, and Network Support. This edition of the book is current to the 2005 objectives as stated by CompTIA.  <br /> <br />All in all, this book is a cram guide. It is not intended to be a generalized reference work on networking, it's purpose is to pass the test. And if you study this book enough, practice using the CD, and understand a bit of what you are doing, you will pass the test.	2005-05-25

Perhaps the deaths of his parents?  <br /> <br />Would you ask about the formation of the most successful band in history?  <br /> <br />Perhaps you'd want to know more about his work in support of AIDS and hunger releif.  <br /> <br />All of these questions, and many, many more are asked and answered in this book. In fact, almost the whole book is a series of questions that ramble from subject to subject with no pattern. These questions and answers are like a normal conversation flows between friends.  <br /> <br />Because they are friends, a true respect exists between the two men and it comes out in the book. This means that there is great insight shown into how Bono thinks. And it comes out that he thinks very well indeed.  <br /> <br />This is a fascinating book, not just because of the fascination with the singer, but because of the insight he brings to us about places like Africa and the Soviet Union.	2005-05-25

On page one, for instance he assumes that you understand the statement SUM(A5000:A5049) means. Then he points out that writing SUM(USSales) would make it easier to understand. He then describes how to name a range of cells -- Not exactly what I'd call advanced, but certainly above novice.  <br /> <br />The first third, or so, of the book is on these kinds of slightly advanced procedures that you could get out of several Excell books. After that he kind of turns the approach around to things like \\"Estimating a Demand Curve.\\" This is looking for what you want to do rather than just looking at a technique within Excell.  <br /> <br />Many of his chapters have fairly sophisticated subjects, \\"Incorporating Qualitative Factors into Multiple Regression.\\" In this chapter he then looks at multiple factors that might go into predicting things like predicting sales, predicting the Presidential race - with fairly surprising results.  <br /> <br />In a couple of chapters he has a bit of fun, i.e. Chapter 73 is \\"Picking Your Fantasy Football Team.\\"  <br /> <br />Excell is quite a powerful package. It can be used for a lot of things beyond just filling out an expense account. In this book a lot of non traditional uses are described in a very light but informative manner. It is a very well done book.	2005-05-24

In this period, large numbers of slaves were transported from Africa to America. This book covers this part of our time in great detail including both transportation, runaways, and the domestic slave trade.  <br /> <br />After the Civil War, the freed-slaves began their own migration away from the south to the northern and western states.  <br /> <br />There were two great migrations from the south to the industrial north during World War I and World War II.  <br /> <br />Finally since 1970 there have been migrations from the Caribbean areas and from Africa. Many of the immigrants from Africa came to the United States for college and did not return to Africa. There has also been a migration returning to the south.  <br /> <br />Each of these migrations is described in detail and the implications analyzed.

The political officer on board was one of the rising stars in the fleet. A dedicated communist he became convinced that the Government in the Soviet Union had deviated away from true communism. His solution was to get the crew of the ship to stage a mutiny where he was to launch a revolution to get rid of the current leadership and restore the Soviet Union to its original comunist goals.  <br /> <br />Needless to say, the rest of the Soviet Navy did not take kindly to this sort of thing and neither did the KGB. Elements of the Soviet Navy attacked the \\"Storozhevoy,\\" stopped it, boarded it, and arrested everyone.  <br /> <br />This incident was the trigger for Tom Clancy to write \\"The Hunt for Red October.\\" In one point in the movie Jack Ryan is talking to the president.

He points out the before the war, the British Army was very active but mainly in peacekeeping roles in small units spread all around the world. Rarely, vary rarely did British commanders have a unit even as large as a division under their command, in one location, doing division sized battles.  <br /> <br />Now, when thrown into WW I they did not know how to command. Further, their staff officers who should have been doing things like planning for supply, movement, and all the other tasks were likewise not experienced in large scale operations.  <br /> <br />At the beginning of the war the leadership asked for a few months to train their men, their officers. For political reasons this was turned down and the Army was sent to France.  <br /> <br />Dr. Robbins breaks down the war into two major periods. In the first, 1914 to 1916 the army was learning, and unfortunately doing the learning by getting young men killed. By 1917, the most grossly incompetent officers had been releived of command and sent home. The British Army by the end of the war was, as shown by comparison with other armies, the equivalent of any.  <br /> <br />I am reminded of certain American generals who were good peacetime generals but failed the test of combat. General Fredendall, of Kasserine Pass fame; Admiral Gormley, Guadalcanal; and General Lucas of Anzio.  <br /> <br />This book presents the difficulties of handling the battles in World War I from an entirely different aspect. The thesis of the book makes sense, and it is highly recommended to anyone with an interest in this period. It is extensively researched and very well written	2005-05-24

The front and back cover are made of plywood. Fitting I suppose. Certainly interesting you your bookshelf.  <br /> <br />Inside, the book is divided into three main sections.  <br /> <br />The first is a history and description of the uses to which bent plywood has been put to in the past. Surprisingly the first patents on plywood go back to 1895, just about the time that the steam engine was becoming powerful enough to spin a log against a slicing knife. Continuing the history through World War II talks about (and shows pictures of) plywood airplanes.  <br /> <br />The middle section is on the production of the plywood furniture, it starts with the bare logs and how they are cut into veneer and finally put into bent-ply furniture. It talks about a bent ply desk designed by Mr. Pfeiffer. This desk has veneer made in Latvia, the assembly of the desk is in Italy, and it is produced for the American market.  <br /> <br />The last section of the book shows a wide selection of furniture articles, illustrating what can be done with bent ply.	2005-05-23

Someone apparently forgot to tell my neighbors who on most days put on their hard hats with headlamps and go down a half mile or so to carve gold ore out of the mountain.  <br /> <br />No, the world out here (Nevada) isn't quite like that pictured in the book. Then again, it's closer to the book than is life in most cities. He visits Carol who provides him with a \\"commercial embrace,\\" for $15 for a half hour.

The right wing will say that it is wonderful. The left will say it is a pack of lies. I guess that I'm in the middle. I don't much care for either the left or right wings.  <br /> <br />I do, however, find the book to be fascinating and well worth reading. His comments on Kerry and Kerry's election are the comments of a seasoned politician watching the national scene. They point out as well as anything that I've seen what Kerry did wrong, and they do so with great insight and understanding.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, the strong right wing stance is not a winner with me. Bush being so far right, and Kerry being so far left ignored the center. And that's why most Americans didn't vote.  <br /> <br />I must say that I'm also concerned about the growth of the religious right in power. They have little tolerance (although Jesus preached tolerance) for opinions not of their own. We don't want this country to become the right wing Christian equivalent of the Islamic countries.  <br /> <br />Read the book, but keep an open mind.	2005-05-23

You don't really know what happened until the books come out. And this is the first book I've seen on what happened in the last election from the point of view of the Democrats. It is fascinating to see what they are thinking happened. This book is not written by the main powers within the Democratic party, but of people from numerous organizations that participate within the framework of the party.  <br /> <br />While getting their viewpoint is fascinating, unfortunately I don't believe that they have \\"Started Making Sense\\" just yet.  <br /> <br />For instance one of the sections is on the Iraq war. The consensus is that we should pull out immediately. The comment is then made, \\"if they choose civil war, it will be their civil war.\\"  <br /> <br />Let's see what could happen. The Shiite's have most of the population, they start a genocide of the Sunni's. The Sunni's call on Syria (predominately Sunni) who responds by sending an army to kill Shiite's. The Shiite's call on Iran (predominately Shiite) who sends another army. This expands all over the Middle East, oil flow stops and gasoline goes to $100 a gallon. Not a good plan Democrats!  <br /> <br />Further, it seems that the main complaint is that some 1,600 American soldiers have been killed. Tragic, true, but. That's about ten days of what we kill on American highways. Where is the demand for safer cars, lower speed limits, etc. It seems that these people segregate deaths into OK (car accidents) or evil (military).  <br /> <br />There's a section in the book on environmentalism, and their mantra is the Kyoto protocol on greenhouse gasses and global warming. Out here in the west where mining is king, people are very happy with the Kyoto protocol. Uranium, you see, has gone from $6 to $21 and the mines are going full boom. Nuclear reactors don't give off any greenhouse gasses. It appears that somewhere between 100 and 200 new nuc's are going to be built in the next few years. Is this really what the environmentalists had in mind?  <br /> <br />Like I said, it is fascinating to see what these people are thinking and well worth reading the book. But as for making sense, not yet.	2005-05-23

The first would have gained him an honorable mention in the chemistry texts of today. The second would get him a Nobel prize, and become the foundation of what we now know of as television. The third article was the theory of relativity.  <br /> <br />Forty years later Paul Tibbets, piloting the 'Enola Gay' dropped the 'Little Boy' atomic bomb on Hiroshima.  <br /> <br />This book is the story of those fifty years. It's a fascinating story of people with genius level minds making new breakthroughs in physics nearly every year. It is also a story of people, of Lise Meitner making a magnificant discovery but having it ignored because she was female.  <br /> <br />Those fifty years transformed the world of physics from a backwater of levers and pulleys into the queen of all the sciences.	2005-05-22

Lee had only five years to live. The heart problems that caused him to spend the battle of the North Anna River in an ambulance killed him. ==In the years following his reputation as a battlefield leader was heavily promoted by writers lamenting the lost cause of Southern independence. These included not only Southerners but Northernors as well.  <br /> <br />In this book Brian Holden Reid, Professor of American History at King's College London, writes from the vantage point of a disinterested outsider to argue that Lee was one of the great commanders of all time. He does not claim that Lee didn't have faults. Everyone does, but that the overall generalship of General Lee ranks him among the best.  <br /> <br />The American Civil War took place at a transition point in military affairs. The war before (Mexico, 1843) and the war that followed (World War I). The author contends that Lee was among the first of the modern generals. If the armies had listened to him during World War I, it probably wouldn't have turned into the mess that it was.	2005-05-22

It's 388 recipies (I'd guess you'd call them, after all this is a cookbook) that comes from the big, worldwide Python community (which can be found at [...]  <br /> <br />Since these recipies are on-line, why would you want to pay money for another book?  <br /> <br />Because the authors have taken best, most tested, most useful of the recipies and put them together in one book.  <br /> <br />Because the book is better organized in terms of an index, a table of contents, and a few pages on each of the major categories that urther define what's in that category. All this is so you can more quickly find what you are looking for.  <br /> <br />Because on-line is great, but you don't exactly know what you're getting. The descriptions on like are very, very short, immediately followed by code. In the book they tell you what problem the programmer is trying to solve, gives the solution, then has a discussion that talks about what that solution really does. And because these writers know what they are talking about.  <br /> <br />Why would you want to read it every month or so? Because like a food cookbook, people don't really follow recipies, they use recipies as a guide to something that sounds good and then they modify it to suit their own tastes. You probably won't use the cookbook code exactly as it very often, you'll use it as a starting point. And just a quick scan of the recipies here may (it does me) give you a starting place for that piece of code you're about to start writing.	2005-05-21

(No, I'm not related, never worked for them, etc.)  <br /> <br />Other than that, this is a combined cookbook, travelogue, and a story written almost like a Bible. This book treats Barbecue almost like the religion that it is.  <br /> <br />You're not going to find instructions like go out and buy a bottle of sauce here, you're going to get instructions on how to make your own sauce (his has fourteen ingredients). You're also going to get the secret formula for Mr. Mills Magic Dust dry rub.  <br /> <br />This is the book for you if you take your Barbecue seriously, and how else would you take it.	2005-05-21

The amount of material available on the Holocaust is emmense. We basically went to war to stop the \\"Ethnic Clensing\\" in the Balkans. But in Cambodia, almost noting, even while it was going on it seemed to be largely ignored. The famous pictures of the piles of skulls seemed to have no effect.  <br /> <br />When this was happening we had just ended our participation in the Viet Nam war. I asked a Viet Nam protester why they weren't protesting what was happening there, why are we building a Holocaust museum when something of almost horror was happening in Cambodia. There was no answer.  <br /> <br />For a time I thought that it might be an issue of race/color. The Jews were white, the Cambodian brown. Then the happenings in Rawanda got a fair amount of press coverage. And I can only conclude that it was just a matter of time. Viet Nam took all the energy the protestors had, perhaps combined with such a contempt/hatred for our own government that they couldn't see the evil in the Khmer Rouge. Maybe it was the left's \\"love\\" for communism that made them blind.  <br /> <br />Peter Maguire's book puts a personal and human face on this genocide. He has talked to the people all over Cambodia, he has analyzed the international response and concluded that \\"international law, human rights, and international criminal courts are little more than sonorous fictions without political will.\\"  <br /> <br />There is no political will to even think much about Cambodia, not while it was happening, not now.	2005-05-21

In the hands of these people Painter is what mere canvas was to the old masters.  <br /> <br />I must say that Ms. Threinen-Pendarvis has done a masterful job in her own right in explaining what the program will do. Her approach, her writing style, is much, much better than the standard click-on-this approach used by many writers and suitable for the beginner or power user.  <br /> <br />This is combined with what seems like more than one color picture on each page, brilliantly printed on a very white paper stock. It's a beautiful, as well as informative book.  <br /> <br />Now if only I could load the CD [demo version of the software, phots, video clips, stuey guide and over 100 custom brushes, and more (developed by Cher)] into my head and develop some talent.	2005-05-21

First though a point of absolute agreement. She says concentrate on something, it really doesn't matter, but something. I concentrate on books and computers.  <br /> <br />First she says that she sets her alarm to go off at 5 AM so that she can get to the opening bell at the garage sale, flea market, or whatever. Nope! I'm not going to set the alarm anywhere nearly that early. Today a local church had a flea market from 7 to 11. I got there about 10:45, I was just about the only customer there. The church ladies were beginning to recognize that they had an awful lot of stuff left. The book table still had an awful lot of books. The sign said Paperbacks $1, Hardbacks $3. These numbers were scratched out and new numbers of 50 cents and $1 were written in. These were scratched out and 20 cents and fifty cents were written in.  <br /> <br />I asked, \\"How much if I take all the books you have left?\\" That caused a conference among the church ladies.  <br /> <br />They came back, \\"Make us an offer.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Well, I brought my truck with me, how about I help you haul stuff out of here in turn for the books?\\"  <br /> <br />Another conference and we made a deal. (This works really well at estate sales where the kids are there from out of town to clean out Grandma's house.)  <br /> <br />Free is a good price for books, you can list any of them for sale at Amazon for a penny and make fifty cents or so on the shipping allowance that Amazon gives you. More important, you may find a jewel. I've sold a few free books for $5, $10, $20, in one case $75.  <br /> <br />Ms. Carbone recommends several things that you should carry in your car. A thing  that I find invaluable is a computer type cell phone with web capability. I can browse to the Amazon web site and quickly check the value of an obscure book while I'm looking over the inventory at athrift store. Some books look like they would be rare and hard to find but it turns out they were recently reprinted and Amazon has 441 copies available starting at a penny.  <br /> <br />As Ms. Carbone says, you will probably eventually specialize. You can't be an expert in everything. Pick something you like, you're going to spend a lot of time working on those things.  <br /> <br />Good Luck!	2005-05-21

About the only good think you can say regarding Peleliu is that it tought some valuable lessons to the Marines. These were to be well used in subsequent campaigns.  <br /> <br />The intelligence about Peleliu was bad, the overall stragegy was arguable, the whole thing was screwed up. Originally it was thought that it was necessary to protect MacArthur's flank as he took the Philippines. Subsequently there was thought that this wasn't necessary, but Nimitz believed that Peleliu would be a easy campaign and useful as an airbase. He was wrong.  <br /> <br />The battle for Peleliu was supposed to last for only about 72 hours as the few hundred or maybe a couple of thousand Japanese were defeated. Instead 10,500 Japanese fought very, very well for thirty days of continuous fight-to-the-last-man combat. It was one of the few islands where the Marines faced Japanese tanks.  <br /> <br />This book follows (mostly) K Company, Third Battalion, Fifth Regiment - K/3/5. K Company was in the forefront of the invasion with 235 men. At the end of the battle 85 answered roll call. This is their story, a story of an incredible brotherhood.  <br /> <br />Great Reading About a Tragic Battle.	2005-05-20

Each one is self contained and more or less independent. I say more or less because quite often the subject relates to racial issues.  <br /> <br />For instance the first essay (and the books title) \\"Black RedNecks and White Liberals\\" talks about the origins of current Afro-American culture as being adopted from the poorer areas of England and Scotland from whence the Southern whites came. I was reminded in this essay of the book from a few years on the Bell Curve, mostly in that it presents an opinion that is all but guaranteed to annoy a lot of people.  <br /> <br />\\"Are Jews Generic\\" presents the idea that the people really being killed in such uprisings were the middlemen who ran small businesses. Something like today's gasoline price situation. The producers in OPEC are responding to the world's supply and demand situation. The oil companies are passing along higher costs (and ever higher taxes). A poll in California said that 73% of the people blame the oil companies for the higher prices. That China and India are buying more doesn't matter, indeed isn't even known. The Jews were the middlemen. The oil companies are now.  <br /> <br />In \\"The Real History of Slavery\\" he points out that our of view of slavery being only a Southern White/Black thing is flawed. For instance the selling of white slaves in Egypt wasn't outlawed until 1885 (although you could still sell Sudanese and Abyssinians).  <br /> <br />The other essays are on Black Education, Germany, and \\"History versus Visions.\\" In these he likewise presents arguments based on how we view history to fit our own perceptions and prejudices reflects our vision.  <br /> <br />He presents fascinating discussions.	2005-05-20

This book is her eulogy. It is composed of letters she wrote between 1966 and her death two days after Christmas, 1985. The letters are combined with more than a hundred color photographs of she and a reverential story of her life by journalist Camilla de la Bedoyere.  <br /> <br />Dian spent most of her adult life in the study of the mountain gorilla. She loved those animals more than life herself, and it was her dedicated attempts to preserve them and protect their future that lead to her unexplained killing.  <br /> <br />Her legacy lives on. Even with the tremendous upheavals in Rwanda, with the killing of a million or more people, the numbers of wild gorillas is growing. It can only be hoped that this book will help more people to understand what Dian stood and died for.	2005-05-20

Unfortunately they have a lot of evidence that they are right. Mr. Cain ran for office. He was defeated in the primary but took great pride in that he finished second in a three way race. Sorry Mr. Cain, but second in the primary is a long way from writing the laws.  <br /> <br />Mr. Cain says that our country has real problems. He is right. But the politicians have learned that the way to get into office is to talk about what an S.O.B. the other candidate is rather than promote plans fo their own.  <br /> <br />Social Security is in trouble. We all know that as the baby boomers retire the present welfare, non-acturarial, based system can't continue as is. President Bush has suggested one step to fixing it. The Democrats have a lot of poll data saying that using this to bash Bush is helping them. They have no incentive to come up with a plan. They even got angry when a Florida (where Social Security is a real issue) suggested part of one.  <br /> <br />The title of the book says, \\"They Think You're Stupid.\\" And the sub-title should be, \\"And the voters are proving them right.\\"  <br /> <br />This is an excellent book in so far as it talks about the problems facing America.

That reached a point where I got handed this book and told to go away.   <br /> <br />First, of course, I turned to the index, looked up what I wanted to do, went to the proper page and it didn't make any sense at all.   <br /> <br />Son-of-a-gun!   <br /> <br />The guru said, \\"have you read the manual?\\"   <br /> <br />Well, not all of it.\\"   <br /> <br />Go read the manual, start at page one.\\"   <br /> <br />I did. And the surprising thing was that it didn't take long at all. From the beginning, it made pretty good sense. And as I got further into it I started finding something neat that I should do about every six or ten pages.   <br /> <br />ANT is a pretty powerful program.   <br /> <br />The book? It's an O'Reilly book, professionally written for professional programmers, what more can I say. Oh yes, it's a new book, and it covers ANT 1.6.   <br /> <br />Highly Recommended!	2005-05-20

When we reach the age when our first parent died we have to come to a kind of realization that they didn't have any more than we're already had. Somewhere about then many of us start to reflect a bit on the life that that parent lived.  <br /> <br />In my case it was a father who lived very poor in rural Arkansas.  His father ... well this is not my family's story. It was later that I realized what he had gone through working in the hot Louisiana sun to give me a couple of college degrees.  <br /> <br />I wish that I had the way with words Mr. Freedman has to put down the story of his mother's life. Indeed I'd like to have even researched my father's life as extensively as he has his mothers.  <br /> <br />It was certainly a different life in the East Bronx than it was in the Arkansas Ozarks. I don't think better, or worse, just different. Mr. Freedman's grandmother had a major and not necessarily beneficial impact on his mother's life. My father's mother had died when he was six (childbirth).  <br /> <br />Mr. Freedman has taken this story beyond just the story of one lady, it's a tale of the life of new immigrants living the Depression Era American Jewish experience. It's a good tribute to Eleanor Freeman. It's also a good tribute to Samuel Freedman.  <br /> <br />He, like I, think of the casual cruelty we caused our parents. We'd like to go back and fix a few things, say a few things. But we can't. Instead, we smile and think of the things our kids have done, and we don't mind.  <br /> <br />Mr. Freedman, your mother is, I think, looking down on you with pride, as I think my father is with me -- even though we know we don't deserve it.	2005-05-20

It's basically a set of standardized XML commands that allow other systems out there to pick up your new stuff and spread the word that it's available.  <br /> <br />At it's simplest, RSS is only a handful of commands that allow you to publish a feed. But this is the computer business and it seems that we strive to make it more complex.  <br /> <br />RSS split into two factions, both of them rightfully claiming that their way is right -- if you need what their way offers. (At the simple level, they are compatible.)  <br /> <br />Tired of the unwillingness to compromise a third group has created Atom, a different set of XML commands to essentially do the same things. Totally different of course.  <br /> <br />One thing this book does is very clearly explain the differences in these various versions and the history about why/how they came about, and a little about where they might be going.  <br /> <br />At least a third of the book then goes into the other side of RSS, which is how to read an RSS Feed. His examples are given in Perl. I don't use perl, but the important part of the examples are simply that they can be done, i.e. getting Doonesbury automatically every morning or tracking a FedEx package.  <br /> <br />As with most O'Reilly books, this is the definitive book on the subject, written by a professional programmer for professional programmers. It's all you need on the subject.	2005-05-19

So I started reading this book with a view to selling some camera and computer items that I had collecting dust. First I decided to read about buying things to see if I agreed.<br /><br />Not only did I agree, but they pointed out some things that I had never thought about, like searching for things with mis-spelled words in the title that would not show up in a search. Sure enough under \\"moboard\\" rather than \\"motherboard\\" I found a dual processor motherboard with no bids that would have gone for thirty - forty bucks if they had spelled out motherboard. There were also lots of boards with the search using the misspelled \\"motherbord.\\"<br /><br />Sounds like these ladies know what they are talking about. I started listing some items for sale, and while the bids haven't closed yet, so far at least what they said has proved dead on accurate.<br /><br />As for making e-bay into a business, their comments on how to find a continuing source of supply for what you can sell profitably makes good sense, but I'm not there yet.<br /><br />Finally the last part of the book is on the gerneral rules of starting any business such as licensing, accounting, taxes, etc. These are a lot like the same rules for starting any business but are tailored slightly with e-bay in mind.<br /><br />All in all, easily worth the money.	2005-05-19

The fact that they exist at all is amazing. Then you have to realize that they are taken a mile or two or three below the surface of the ocean. It's a long ways down there, you can't spend long there, and you are shooting the picture through water. And the pictures you are taking are of things that man has never seen before, at one point they counted 500 newly identified species.  <br /> <br />I also liked the occassional reference to the way this is not unlike space exploration, one comment, \\"piloting a mini-sub at 12,000 feet is very similar to flying a spacecraft to another planet.

From every movie Hollywood put out, combined with excellent public relations, the Air Force was the Golden Boy of the war. It appeared that the Air Force won the war themselves (especially if you listened to an Air Force General) and there was no longer any need for any other services.  <br /> <br />This translates to no budget for the other services. The Navy had to find a way, or better yet, multiple ways to deliver nuclear bombs. And the short range and limited lift of carrier based aircraft eliminated them. The answer was a plane to complete with the B-47. And since there had to be something to do with the water, make it a flying boat. Great idea, it got the budget, unfortunately it didn't work.  <br /> <br />This is the story of the development of the Martin P6M Sea Master. It was a sleek looking, jet powered, high performance machine. Unfortunately technical problems delayed its development, and the needs of the Navy changed. Although it could be argued that the admirals in charge at the end of the war were as carrier oriented as their predecessors were battleship oriented.  <br /> <br />Also the technology passed them by. Nuclear weapons got smaller, carrier aircraft got larger, no need for a big bomber. The maritime patrol application got replaced by the satellites. And by then there were a lot of concrete runways all around the world.  <br /> <br />It's sad to see the project fail, but looking at it realistically, there haven't been any really successful flying boats produced since the war except for specialty applications such as air-sea rescue or forest fire fighting.  <br /> <br />Very enjoyable reading.	2005-05-19

Like a lot of others I have known that I should start to learn Linux. The reliability, the cost (FREE is a very good price), the speed; everything points to moving to Linux.  <br /> <br />But I haven't. Just like the opening pages say, I don't want to take a chance on ruining the Windows operating system that is already installed, I don't want to risk losing the data on the hard drive. All excuses, but real enough for me and millions of others to say \\"not just yet.\\"  <br /> <br />Using the Move Linux distribution distributed with this book removes any and all of these excuses. Here's a Linux that's set up to run from the CD-ROM drive. It won't touch your hard drive in any way. Likewise you can't save anything unless you put in a USB Jump drive, but that's OK, they're cheap - in fact I got a couple as give-aways at trade shows.  <br /> <br />Anyway, put in the disk, start the system, answer a few questions simple enough for even me to answer (like what language would you like to use - English I quickly answered as I don't speak any others), and there was a windows-like desktop.  <br /> <br />I say windows-like because it isn't exactly the same as windows, but it is close enough that you won't have any problems. The book leads you through a Linux test drive by starting out quite simple. First you go web browsing. This is familiar to Windows-IE users and not all that different using the browser included on the CD (Konqueror). I then skipped a bunch of chapters on things I didn't care about like games and image processing.  <br /> <br />I looked at the StarOffice suite of products some years ago, BOY has that progressed. The OpenOffice.org people have done a supurb job. It's not identical, but close enough that using it is no problem. This is another one of those things that I wouldn't have gone to the trouble to download and install, but here it is on the disk, already installed.  <br /> <br />The last part of the book is on moving from this CD-only installation to a real installation. Mr. Brickner has the best discussion I've seen on which distribution to use. This is all that I possibly could have asked out of a book like this.	2005-05-19

The techniques are used to attempt to identify some cause and effect relationships in our culture.  <br /> <br />The big one that has generated is his analysis that relates the passage of Roe v. Wade (the abortion case) to the big reduction in crime that's been seen in recent years. His analysis offends a lot of people, but for the most part the author just puts out the data as he sees it.  <br /> <br />Other points that directly affect what our culture is doing involve the public education system:  <br /> <br />One analysis of his says if you install standardized tests in school with a program to reward the teachers who do best, then you encourage teachers to cheat -- in some cases by directly altering the test sheets, as was the cause of a scandal in Chicago.  <br /> <br />Another looks at what things (such as reading to them) help a kid in school. As with his other studies, the results are surprising.  <br /> <br />This is a popular book, written somewhat to amuse and illustrate. It does not have the heavy mathematical analysis that you would expect in an economics book.	2005-05-19

At least not in our lifetimes. These documents were collected by Gordon Prange while working for the Military History Section of the American forces that occupied Japan. Afterwards Prange with the assistance of Goldstein and Dillon wrote several books on World War II.  <br /> <br />In this book, Goldstein and Dillon have collected various papers from various Japanese sources. These included the C-in-C of the Japanese Navy to Naval Commander Chihaya who worked for Prange in Japan and wrote several essays on the war.  <br /> <br />As you would expect the quality of the documents quoted here vary from excellent to rather terse. Admiral's Kondo's report on the sinking of the Repulse and the Prince of Whales says simply \\"...our planes succeeded in catching the enemy fleet in sight off Kuantan just through a slit in the clouds. And they succeeded in sinking them!\\" On the other hand he tells what he and the rest of the second fleet were doing at the time.  <br /> <br />These are the original documents, or as close as we will get, they are the basis for a lot of the books written on the war. It's interesting to see what the people involved were thinking.	2005-05-18

Boy, was I ever wrong. These people don't approach fishing like that at all. \\"Nuts\\" is not a word that I would use, but it's not far off.  <br /> <br />A little background, the world record for large mouth bass is now 72 years old. Other catches have come close to the twenty two pounds four ounces of that fish, but so far, none have surpassed it.  <br /> <br />Since then, but especially in the past few years people have been diligently seeking to surpass this record. I hate to have to say this, but it is rumored that some people have even tried to cheat to break the record. Texas is even trying to breed the biggest fish, well, what would you expect from Texas.  <br /> <br />This is the story of the quest for the fish, the people, their lakes, and tales of the \\"sport.\\" It's a delightful read. And while you'll necer catch the winning pass at the Super Bowl, you could catch the biggest bass.	2005-05-18

This is the fifteenth of Ian Rankin's mystery book featuring John Rebus and Siobhan Clarke. As with all of his excellent stories, there are murders all over the streets of Edinburgh. They are, of course, all inter-related but how. I'm not going to tell the story. That's what the book is all about.  <br /> <br />A good mystery has to have something else going for it besides a good mystery. This book has two things:  <br /> <br />One is the developing characters of the two heros. They are getting along, and developing as they go. Times are tough, but they'll grow to get through.  <br /> <br />Second is the background story of the growth in England of the \\"people of colour\\" through immigration. This is a much darker story of life in the underside of our world.	2005-05-18

In January of 1943 General Groves ordered the commandeering of 670 square miles of Washington State land as \\"necessary to the public interest.\\" On it he built the Hanford plant to produce plutonium.  <br /> <br />Everything was done one a rush basis, and by 1945 something like 30 pounds of plutonium had been produced. No one knew if a bomb produced using plutonium would even work. About thirteen and a half pounds of it were used on July 16, 1945 at Trinity site. It worked. A duplicate of that device, with some streamlining and tail fins added was dropped over Nagasaki. It worked there too.  <br /> <br />This book is an oral history, a series of discussions with dozens of people who were working at or in conjunction with Hanford. It's a unique side to the story.	2005-05-18

Of the half million or so items in the museum, some 200 have selected by the museum's curators for photographing and presentation in this large format book.  <br /> <br />Included are paintings by Catlin, Russell, Moran, and Remington. The front cover of the book is Moran's \\"Tower Falls\\" perhaps the single thing that caused the Congress to set aside Yellowstone National Park.  <br /> <br />While the subject of the American West may be thought of by some as not suitable for serious work, some of the painting, such as the night time scene of the Pony Express (Frank Tenney Johnson) are of as high a technical quality as can be found anywhere.  <br /> <br />A mere book is not the same as visiting the museum, but is about as close as most of us can come.  <br /> <br />Beautiful Book!	2005-05-18

They each contain 100 hints and tips that intermediate to advanced users will find very useful. In fact, I don't believe that it's possible to pick up the book and not find something that you wish you had known earlier when you were working on some project.  <br /> <br />This is not a book for beginners. It presumes that you have and have used Access. To get full advantage of the book, you also need to have at least a little bit of experience with Visual Basic. It is also not a beginner's level introduction to SQL, the language of databases that Access speaks. It talks about SQL in some of the hacks, but again the concept is something you should know.  <br /> <br />Having said all this, the intermediate/advanced user will find this book to be absolutely filled with good information. The only complaints I have are that the book isn't big enough. I'd like to see a little more on SQL, and the differences between The Access version of SQL and the other versions that are out there. Also, I'd like to see some information about using Access with it's alternative back end database engine -- MSDE. Microsoft included this with Access. Which engine should I use, why?  <br /> <br />Mr. O'Reilly, maybe this should be the idea behind a new book on Access.	2005-05-18

It remains one of the biggest disasters in military history. In addition to the French casualties, there were untold Russian casualties. Not the least of these was the battle at Borodino, 70,000+ men killed in one day. Then came General Winter.  <br /> <br />This book concentrates on just this escapade of Napoleon. It is based on the diaries and letters of soldiers, many of which have not been published in English before. It goes far beyond the bare facts often cited in traditional histories to more clearly show Napoleon's actions as the primary general of his time making several mistakes that would eventually cause his downfall.  <br /> <br />This book is far more complete than most, giving much better coverage of the north and side flanks of Napoleon's army than is generally found.  <br /> <br />Exceedingly well done, this book is going to remain the definitive book on this campaign.	2005-05-18

S. make it imperative that any country concerned about an attack from the United States have nuclear weapons. I note that I don't see President Bush talking much about attacking North Korea. General Gary Luck offered a quick sound bite on the costs of a war in N. Korea: \\"one million casualties, one trillion dollars in industrial damage and lost business.\\"  <br /> <br />In this excellent book the authors attempt to bring some sense to the scare headlines so loved by the news media -- Newsweek called the North Korean leader, \\"Dr. Evil.\\" The book is written by two professors, one a bit more hawkish, one a bit more dovish. They present their views, they discuss the others viewpoint, they then try to come up with an overall plan that makes sense.  <br /> <br />A million casualties -- somebody better come up with a plan that's better than TV's talking heads.  <br /> <br />With this book I also highly recommend \\"North Korea at a Crossroads\\" by Suk Hi Kim.	2005-05-18

It's difficult to imagine that a character of Howard Kapostash's complexity springs to the page as complete as it does here. And that of his high school girlfriend Sylvia equally scarred. The story seems almost perfect for a movie: the damaged Viet Vet, Sylvia who all but dumps her nine year old son Ryan on Howard when she goes into drug rehab.  <br /> <br />It would have been easy for such characters to get trapped in so much sugar water that they could never get out. But that doesn't happen. In the hands of Mr. King the characters become human, they become people we want to know, they are certainly people we don't want to lose at the end of the book.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended. This may be Mr. King's first novel, but it certainly won't be his last.	2005-05-18

As such it is, perhaps, just a bit one sided, but it does produce a work with more previously unknown information than would be possible. The author is also an American and views the Pope through American eyes, not necessarily the most universal of views.  <br /> <br />At over a thousand pages, this is likely to remain the definitive biography for years to come.	2005-05-18

The books on the land battles of the American Civil War have to outnumber the books on the naval side by a hundred to one. This book is basically the diary of William C. Whittle, the executive officer of the CSS Shenandoah. It was lost until discovered in the 1980's by his grandaughter. It is a day by day report of the rather remarkable voyage of the Shenandoah.  <br /> <br />This ship was purchased in England, converted to a raider, and set sail for the pacific ocean with 42 men on board (a ship of this size would normally need a crew of 150). From October 8, 1864 until two months after the war was over (no communications) the Shenandoah captured thirty-eight Yankee vessels valued at over one million dollars. After the war she sailed back to England.  <br /> <br />Lt. Whittle's diary varies from short position reports with the direction of the winds, to reports of the ships captured, and other activities. Surprising to me was the constant referencing to the weather -- important if you're in a sailing ship, but not something I realized. Almost every entry begins with the two words \\"At sea.\\" The Shenandoah didn't spend much time in port, the longest was a visit to Melbourne, Australia for about a month.  <br /> <br />Lt. Whittle's writing is clear and to the point. You are left with a better understanding of what it was like to operate a warship during these, the last days of sail.	2005-05-17

WDSC is an Eclipse based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is being emphasised over the 20+ year old Source Entry Utility (SEU). [Although to be sure SEU still has some strond supporters, and is even being expanded with new features and capabilities.]  <br /> <br />The step-by-step approach is to build a web site using virtually every tool built into WDSC. Each chapter starts out with a checklist of each step, this list has a bunch of things like \\"Click on the Green Tab.\\" But don't worry about this. Each step will be discussed later on in much more detail. It will tell you what the Green Tab does. Inbetween steps, there is some discussion of what's really going on behind the Green Tab, which you can read now, or easily skip to move on if you're comfortable with what you've done.  <br /> <br />The Step-by-Step books have come up with this way to help you move through the learning process, I rather like it.	2005-05-17

This lets out all the burger-chicken-fish places and limits the choice to those kinds of business that might be done in a home. And wisely, the first page of the book asks the question, Is It Legal. There are an awful lot of restrictions on running a business out of your home. The book points out some common ones, but you need to investigate local laws. Some of the businesses listed in this book wouldn't be legal to run from a home in most places.  <br /> <br />After that, up to page 108 in the book is about general rules of running a business and the advantages and disadvantages of a franchise. Advantage: it should be a proven concept that is simply being replicated elsewhere. Disadvantage: you have to run the business exactly as the franchiser tells you.  <br /> <br />After that the book lists some generalized information about 300+ franchise operations. Maybe one of them will fit your needs. Note that in their top ten list, eight of the ten have something to do with cleaning.	2005-05-17

First she has to deal with all the normal problems of a separation, the feeling of abandonment, the effect on the kids, the rest of the family and the job of rebuilding your whole life. Then as word gets out, all kinds of advice comes in from family, friends, and various members of her Christian church -- you can imagine what some of these are. Competing with another woman is one thing, but how does a woman compete with a man?  <br /> <br />That's, of course, not enough, Sheridan's father comes down with cancer, her sixteen year old son (yes, a teenager in the family), there's teenage pregnancy, and her best friend who can't settle down.  <br /> <br />This is enough to slam anyone down to the ground.

Most books talk about the big three SQL commands of SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE as being just about all that SQL can do.  <br /> <br />In reality, the \\"L\\" stands for \\"Language\\" and the full fledged SQL's in the big databases are full fledged languages. Like other languages, they have logic, loops, functions, and internal variables just like other languages.   <br /> <br />While SQL is a standard, each implementation does things just a bit differently. This small book gives a very quick overview of the standard commands like SELECT, but spends most of its pages on doing stored procedures the IBM way.	2005-05-17

It begins with a general discussion on the rising number of nonprofits that are seeking grants from the rising number of granting organizations.  <br /> <br />From there it goes into what it takes to make your grant fit what the grantor is looking for. It lightly covers each point of grant seeking including mundane things like accounting/budgets and the impact of various laws and IRS rulings like Sarbanes-Oxley. It also goes into what the reader is going to be looking for such as how the grant will be managed, why the foundation doesn't like to fund adminstration, operating costs and endowments, and other points.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the most important part of the book is its discussion of where to go for more information on nearly every aspect of the grantwriting project. Many of these are web related at no cost, others such as the authors favorite books on grant writing have fairly nominal costs.	2005-05-17

I was surprised, I always thought ANT was a pretty dull tool.  To be sure, every time I wanted it to do something I could eventually get it to do it. (Actually I went and got help from the guru.) That reached a point where I got handed this book and told to go away.  <br /> <br />First, of course, I turned to the index, looked up what I wanted to do, went to the proper page and it didn't make any sense at all.  <br /> <br />Son-of-a-gun!  <br /> <br />The guru said, \\"have you read the manual?\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Well, not all of it.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Go read the manual, start at page one.\\"  <br /> <br />I did. And the surprising thing was that it didn't take long at all. From the beginning, it made pretty good sense. And as I got further into it I started finding something neat that I should do about every six or ten pages.  <br /> <br />ANT is a pretty powerful program.  <br /> <br />The book? It's an O'Reilly book, professionally written for professional programmers, what more can I say. Oh yes, it's a new book, and it covers ANT 1.6.  <br /> <br />Highly Recommended!	2005-05-17

Lewis.  <br /> <br />There are numerable books on what happened in the war. But this one does two things, first it covers Mr. Lewis's war years, a period often skipped in the traditional biographies of Lewis. But second, he uses the war years and their impact on Lewis to examine the expectations people had of a more settled life being replaced by the trauma of an almost unbelievable war. Lewis, an Irishman, wanted to escape the war and wound up on the front lines. He survived the war, but was wounded (and had shell fragments in his chest) and suffered nightmares. This was what we now call PTSD, but it was long before that term was invented.  <br /> <br />Dr. Gilchrist has produced a book of rare insight.	2005-05-16

In this book, the authors have examined the files of the British Air Intelligence (AI) for every scrap of information they could find on every airplane that the Germans had.  <br /> <br />Then they organized this information so that each airplane has a chronological report of what the British learned, when, and from what source. The main sources are photo recon (PR), prisoner interrogation, and examination of crashed planes.  <br /> <br />From a standpoint of studying the planes themselves, there are only a few tidbits of new data (and some of the things that the Brits learned were wrong and didn't show up until later). From the view of trying to see what the British were learning and how they learned it it is a fascinating piece of work.  <br /> <br />It gives an insight into how intelligence is gathered. It makes it much easier to understand about how big intelligence lapses (Pearl Harbour, 9/11) can happen.  <br /> <br />A specialized book, but very interesting.	2005-05-16

Cuba's economy, as with most of the communist centrally planned economies, is at subsistence level. Average annual per capita income is about $1,500 per person. But still it survives. Two new books go a long ways towards explaining why.  <br /> <br />Don Bohning's \\"The Castro Obsession\\", talks about the secret (and not so secret) operations conducted against Castro from 1959 to 1965. The appearance of a giant country like the United States arrayed against a small insignificant country like Cuba, and then failing created a groundswell of respect and support for Castro among people and countries that root for the underdog.  <br /> <br />Humberto Fontova's \\"Fidel: Hollywood's Favorite Tyrant\\", is really two books in one. The main theme talks about the comments from selected Hollywood types, media and political left wing liberals, praising Castro (shades of Hanoi Jane Fonda). The secondary theme is that Castro has instituted a bloody repressive regime that attempts to control all life in Cuba. While this is not a surprise, the details are shocking in that we have so much more information because of the communication with large numbers of Cubans now living in the US but retaining close links with the island.  <br /> <br />These two books provide interesting background for the actions that will be playing out over the next few years.	2005-05-16

There are other books aimed at the complete beginner that will start off with a much simpler \\"Here's How\\" approach to get you started. This book instead starts off with the history, the basic ECMAScript standards and a discussion on the Object nature of JavaScript. It's written by a working programmer to fill the real world needs of other working programmers. It does this job very well.  <br /> <br />Further, the book is new and up to date. JavaScript is an evolving language as the web grows to demand increasing capabilities. Some of these features that now get full chapters in this book include: XML, Client-Server communications, Web Services, interacting with Plug-Ins.  <br /> <br />The last chapter talks about the next step in the development of JavaScript, with cautions that this material is still preliminary and subject to change.  <br /> <br />Excellent book for the intermediate to advanced JavaScript programmer.	2005-05-16

There is no question in my mind that the balance of openness vs. security is a major question of the time. Today we are seeing more and more people calling for ever increasing security. The paper yesterday said that a new requirement for a drivers license will be to present four forms of ID. Where is a sixteen year old supposed to get four forms of ID?  <br /> <br />There is a big flack about issuing drivers licenses to illegal migrant workers from Mexico. Do these people say that we want these people driving without a license. A drivers license is (perhaps was is a better word) supposed to be proof only that the person understands the little driving book. That's good if someone is to drive a car.  <br /> <br />This book recognizes the problem of more government control, but says that the constitutional protections are sufficient to say that the Government won't run amuck. In view of the Patriot's Act and the Drug laws that says the carrying of 'significant' amounts of cash is presumptive of drug purchasing intent, I'm not so sure.  <br /> <br />The author also puts his faith in an ID card with embedded biometric data. I have one of those. It was issued by the passport people and at selected airports a kiosk would let me come into the country without having to stand in the passport line. After 9/11 they stopped using these machines. Evidently the Government decided that measuring the biometrics of my hand was less secure than having an immigration person ask me a few questions.  <br /> <br />A very interesting contribution to the story of our time, I'm just not quite convinced yet.	2005-05-16

Virtually all of the developed countries in Europe, Asia, and around the world have gone to a non-draft mode.  <br /> <br />The results have been astounding, far exceeding what the original proponents had predicted. The troops (and we are really just talking about the Army as the other forces were all volunteer before) that we have now are: smarter, better educated, more law abiding (a criminal record keeps you out of the service), use fewer drugs, have a higher esprit de corp, and re-enlist at a higher rate.  <br /> <br />This book is a report based on a conference of people with direct experience with the AVF. It is based on the first thirty years of the AVF. The report is broken down into five parts:  <br /> <br />The All-Volunteer Force in Perspective  <br />Sustaining the Force: Recruiting and Retention  <br />Reserve Component Contributions to the All-Volunteer Force  <br />Transformation in Military Manpower and Personnel Policy  <br />The Next Decade.  <br /> <br />I have heard rumors in the press that currently enlistments are down because of the war in Iraq. Doing a quick search on the internet shows a lot of smoke and noise, but little real data. Everyone opposed to the war seems to have a web page saying that recruitment is down, and we must get out of Iraq, etc. Other pages say that the military is increasing incentives and attracting the number and quality of the people they need.  <br /> <br />In the long run, I doubt that we will return to the draft, but I suppose if the anti-war people are successful ....	2005-05-16

Cuba's economy, as with most of the communist centrally planned economies, is at subsistence level. Average annual per capita income is about $1,500 per person. But still it survives. Two new books go a long ways towards explaining why.  <br /> <br />Don Bohning's \\"The Castro Obsession\\", talks about the secret (and not so secret) operations conducted against Castro from 1959 to 1965. The appearance of a giant country like the United States arrayed against a small insignificant country like Cuba, and then failing created a groundswell of respect and support for Castro among people and countries that root for the underdog.  <br /> <br />Humberto Fontova's \\"Fidel: Hollywood's Favorite Tyrant\\", is really two books in one. The main theme talks about the comments from selected Hollywood types, media and political left wing liberals, praising Castro (shades of Hanoi Jane Fonda). The secondary theme is that Castro has instituted a bloody repressive regime that attempts to control all life in Cuba. While this is not a surprise, the details are shocking in that we have so much more information because of the communication with large numbers of Cubans now living in the US but retaining close links with the island.  <br /> <br />These two books provide interesting background for the actions that will be playing out over the next few years.	2005-05-16

The Story of the North American X-15	Books	5	5	5	N	N	The Definitive Story	Today when the space shuttle is about the only advanced thing going, it is hard to imagine what was really going on almost fifty years ago. Then a remarkable airplane was built in a very short time and flew 199 times to set records that still stand.  <br /> <br />Funded by the Navy, Air Force and NASA, three X-15's were built. They carried pilots high enough to earn them astronauts wings and to set one speed record after another.  <br /> <br />Here in almost 300 pages is the complete story of the X-15 that starts with the conceptual blueprints of the four bidders (Bell, of the X-1 fame; Douglas, of the SkyRocket, Stiletto); Republic; and of course North American, the winner of the competition. It goes from there through each flight until the last in 1968. There are over 500 photographs of everything from the people, every detail of the plane, and of course of the flights.  <br /> <br />This is the definitive story.	2005-05-15

As a kid it was my father and I outside cooking and talking. (I still remember the time that he couldn't get the charcoal to light fast enough until he got out the oxy-acetylene torch.) And as recently as last night a bunch of friends and I got together and drank and talked and cooked.  <br /> <br />Almost always I've stuck to the same simple foods, steak, hamburger, chicken, maybe a piece of fish or some shrimp. It wasn't until I got this book that I realized that I had just scratched the surface. Flipping through it yesterday I found a way to do shrimp that I had never considered. I did them that way last night.  <br /> <br />Tonight I'm going to do chicken, but I'm going to do it following his recipe for Chicken Under Bricks, I've always had a problem with the thin parts of the chicken cooking too fast. This sounds like a good approach. I don't suppose the author will mind if I put a few more spices on the chicken, something like his Mexican Chicken. It's ideas like these that make a book like this so worthwhile.	2005-05-15

We have had airport security for years now. It didn't help on 9/11.  <br /> <br />Now we have the so called Patriot's Act. How could you possibly be opposed to something with a name like that? Until, of course, you read it. And a policeman friend of mine thinks that it's just fine as it is. We'll have to see what the courts say as the test cases wind their way through the system.  <br /> <br />This book is somewhat of a scare book that talks about the way Big Brother can watch you virtually all the time, like sending this book review across the Internet. The techniques the author talks about are real, and the book is well worth reading just to find out what they are.  <br /> <br />But this is not the whole story either. All of this information that is being gathered has to be selected, corelated, and combined in strange ways for it to be useful to anyone. And the volume of data makes this ever harder. Remember that the information about the 9/11 was in the system somewhere beforehand. It was only later that it was pieced together to show that the data was there, just not put together.  <br /> <br />As more and more data is collected, pulling out the jewels from the garbage gets harder and harder. Most important, things tend to go in cycles. The Democrats just weren't there when the Patriot's Act was passed. They just didn't fight it. One day the Democrats will be in power again. We'll have to see what they do.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Bib Brother is watching. Has it removed enough drugs from the streets to make difficult to get? I don't think so. Will the next terrorist act get caught before it happens? No. Some acts may be prevented. But a dedicated terrorist will be ableto do something some day.  <br /> <br />Today I read in the paper about a bunch of drug enforcement people who were in the drug smuggling business. who watches the watchers, and who watches them.	2005-05-15

Ms. Duffy's other books have titles like \\"Christian Home Educators Curriculum Manual.\\" In this book it appears that she has tried to become more general in approach to present information to the broader spectrum of home teachers.  <br /> <br />I really like her approach to stressing that the advantage of home schooling is to enable the schooling to be tailored to the specific needs of each individual student rather than fitting into the master plan of the school system. This is stressed in the sub-title of the book.  <br /> <br />Only in the science area is the Christian view brought strongly to the fore. Here she selects curriculum that stress creation and if evolution is mentioned it tends to be mentioned as, \\"provides tidbits of scientific information with which to challenge the theory of evolution.\\" A child going on to college with only this kind of background may have a much more difficult time than one tought the generally accepted theories.	2005-05-14

Other than that, it's excellect. The book is intended for the almost newbie. That is someone who knows how to turn the machine on, knows that a mouse is a plastic thing with buttons instead of a furry thing in the pantry, and so forth.<br /><br />The book is divided into eight major subsections, or as the book says, 8 mini books. These are intended to be self standing so that if you want to set up an internet server you really only to read that particular book (but you may want to read a couple of others like the ones on administration and security).<br /><br />Like a lot of Linux books, this one comes with a DVD disk, filled with lots of software (the DVD can hold a lot more data than a conventional CD). Or for $11 you can order a set of CD's that contain the Fedorea 3 Core distribution.<br /><br />One point about the book I liked, he tells you how to make a partition to dual boot Windows and Linux. But he also comments that you might want to set up your experimental Linux system on a separate freestanding machine. This is clearly the way to go. I bought a computer at a thrift shop recently - 1 GHZ AMD Athlon - certainly not the hottest iron on the market, but it was only $75, including a 17\\" monitor. I've seen too many people screw up an installation and wipe out a hard drive to suggest that the newbie do a dual boot.<br /><br />The problem I have with the book. He includes five flavors of Linux on the disk. In the first part of the book he goes a bit into the various distributions, but he never makes a solid recommendation. (There is a hint that this was the editors recommendation to get one book that would please the fans of any distribution.) If the newbie knows enough to say that he wants Debian or SUSE or Fedora, he probably doesn't need a For Dummies book. And the author does not say the advantages of the particular distributions, merely that they are here and here's how you install them.<br /><br />By default the DVD loads Fedora, and that's fine. But in the installation section the author has to jump around a lot talking about the way the other distributions do things and it gets confusing. When you read the installation chapter, feel free to ignore what you aren't using.	2005-05-14

What's been missing has been a centralized source for information about the whole thing. This book provides that source. It's not complete - if it were it would be so big that you couldn't carry it around - but it's a great start.  <br /> <br />You can read this book from cover to cover in just a few hours. That is, just a few hours if you don't take the time to go out on the web looking at the things she suggests. And that right there is the key to this book. Here is a good start that covers the whole field from A to Z, and at nearly each and every point along the way she points you to web sites for more information about specific points.  <br /> <br />The problem with going to the web for more information, of course, is that web sites appear, go away, merge or whatever. She admits this, but accepts this risk and gives you multiple sites (you couldn't possibly visit all that she mentions) or suggests ways to find a missing or dead site.  <br /> <br />This is a great way to get the basic information you need before getting started with selecting a broker and deciding what to buy.	2005-05-14

Bob Dole spent most of his life as a politician, but that's another story, another book. This is the story of Bob Dole's military career and the aftermath of being wounded in combat.  <br /> <br />This story is one of courage and the continual battle to regain what was lost on a mountain in Italy. Bob Dole is a member of what has been called the Greatest Generation. And regardless of what you might think of his politics, he is a great member of that generation.  <br /> <br />Also surprising is his humor that comes out in his writing. His is not the dour even sullen personality that came across in the election. His is more the Bob Dole being asked for ID in the American Express commercial.  <br /> <br />We are now engaged in a foreign war where young men are coming back horribly wounded.

Quite possibly the two most common illnesses that cause this situation is breast cancer for women and prostate cancer for men.  <br /> <br />In this book, one of the premier surgeons specializing in the area, talks about both the disease and its treatment. There are many treatments, including drugs, radiation and of course surgery. All of these are discussed, although there seems to be a slight bias towards surgery. The book was published in April of 2005, this allows the most recent drugs and treatments to be covered, including some that are still in the test stages.  <br /> <br />Above all else, this book will help when these tough decisions have to be made.

Here is a 'New Kind of Christianity.'  <br /> <br />Whenever a movement as strong as the fundamentalists form, an antithesis has to come about. The certainty that drives the fundamentalists has been replaced by doubt and uncertainty. The dictatorial view of the pastor has been replaced by questions of 'what do you think, what do you believe.'  <br /> <br />An interesting point about the new Christianity is that it's main written foundation seems to be this trilogy (this is the third book in the series) which is written in the form of novels with the main characters (Pastor Dan Poole and his friend Neil Oliver) convey the theological message in the form of conversations. Well, why not, the Bible is mostly stories and parables. And if you approach this as just a novel, it's not bad reading, although they do talk about religion a lot.	2005-05-13

Then Front Page came along and you didn't even have to learn HTML.  <br /> <br />Alas, no more. ==Why standards? Because you want to get the most interaction possible between your web site and things the might be visiting it. Things? Yes, things. You normally think of a browser visiting your site to display the page, but search engines use robots to visit as well, and you want your site to show up when when Google or Yahoo come to call.  <br /> <br />The particular standards covered in this book include:  <br /> <br />XHTML, the logical extension to HTML,  <br />CSS, which has been around a while, but is largely ignored,  <br />Accessibility, where you need to consider that your visitor might not have a mouse or a screen,  <br />XForms, the upcoming replacement for HTML forms (note upcoming, don't use them yet),  <br />XLink, the same thing to replace hyperlinks, eventually.  <br /> <br />This book is kind of a heads-up on what web development is going to become.

There's nothing exactly new here. What there is here is a well written and clear way for us to understand what's really important to get out of life. Perhaps it's a way of looking over our lives and getting rid of a lot of emotional baggage that we've been carrying about.  <br /> <br />We all know that success is more than making money.

Something like a CD player that is smaller, holds more music, can be down loaded to hold the songs you like. A simple minded, easy to use device.<br /><br />In truth, however, it's far more. For one thing, the iPod is a very small machine with an incredible amount of memory. What you load into the iPod doesn't have to be songs. It can be any kind of data that you want to carry from one computer to another.<br /><br />That's the sort of thing that you expect to get from the Missing Manual series. In this case, how to use the iPod for data storage is just one use you can get out of the little thing. Other such applications include calendar, address book, to-do list, notes, eBook, Game Machine and more.<br /><br />Likewise the book covers the iTunes software that connects the iPod to a computer (either Apple or Windows based). Not only does it cover the standard things you can do with the software, but it goes into the details of how to do a lot of things.<br /><br />The Missing Manual series is a great way to get more out of something you already have.	2005-05-13

Instead it is a love story. It's about a love for the sea, for the boat, for life itself.  <br /> <br />Nominally it's the story of a voyage along the Atlantic coasts of England, Ireland, Scotland, and the islands north of there. It's partly the story of the trip; it's partly a philosophy of life, of man putting himself and his wind propelled boat against the elements.  <br /> <br />Mr. Nicolson has a way with the written word that makes his prose almost like poetry or music in the hands of another.

It seems that it is much easy to believe in a conspiracy with 'they' being out to get you than to simply say that a bunch of people screwed up. And now it seems that we've finally found one to, hopefully, replace the conspiracy that killed Kennedy and perhaps even the one about the UFO's at Roswell.  <br /> <br />The truth appears to be bad enough. The intelligence agencies of the United States, Britain, Australia, Israel, Germany, France and Russia all got it wrong. (Yes, France and Russia believed in the WMD's as well but didn't want an invasion because they were getting preferential oil pricing from Iraq to trade for weapons.)  <br /> <br />The real problem here is that if we believe in a conspiracy, then we won't feel it necessary to take the steps to fix the real problem.  <br /> <br />This book has been dismissed as centrist propaganda by one reviewer. I don't know what that is, left wing I know, right wing I know. Centrist to me says that the writer is trying to be unbiased - and that's what I really want to read. It seems to me that the book is pretty fairly balanced. My only real complaint is that it doesn't have an index, and with its format, it is sometimes difficult to go back and see where it said something.  <br /> <br />For another report, the article in the Atlantic in the January/February 2004 by Kenneth M. Pollack titled Spies, Lies, and Weapons: What Went Wrong is highly recommended - It's available on line at no charge.	2005-05-13

And I was surprised. Here is this man, married with two small children living in Asia. In the evenings he would go out to meet spies that he had recruited for the CIA. Somehow all this just didn't register as the romantic view that \\"Bond, James Bond\\" had created. It makes spying seem just like any other profession.<br /><br />And I guess that it must be so. He is concerned with the same kinds of things that bother the rest of us: salary, promotions, bosses -- all those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was expecting to read a lot more about wher he worked and just what he did, but this wasn't there. I guess that the author still respected the secrecy enough to simply not mention it.<br /><br />Perhaps the most useful parts of the book were on his observations about the various heads of the CIA and the view of the various Presidents toward the agency. Finally the CIA is an agency of our Government, with all of the strengths and weaknesses that that implies. This book helps to de-mystify the agency.	2005-05-13

Perhaps it's a medical problem, a mild heart attack or a mini-stroke that is the body's way of telling us to show down. Perhaps it's the realization that for years we've been doing things we didn't and headed in a direction that we really didn't want to go. Perhaps it's the birth of a child that makes you realize that there are more important things than you realized before.  <br /> <br />That's the theme of this book. And the questions are answered by dozens of people who took the time to produce the answers.	2005-05-13

But I find that you don't really know what happened until the books come out. This book is a perfect example. This is the story of the 3rd battalion of the 4th Marine Regiment - the Three-Four Marines - and their march from Kuwait to downtown Baghdad.  <br /> <br />The author was embedded with the Three-Four during the war. More important, however, the author had been a marine himself. He understood what the grunts were going through, he also understood what the leaders, especially Lt. Col. McCoy was doing.  <br /> <br />More than a story of combat, this is a story of leadership in action. McCoy leads from the front, inspires his men, all the things that the talk about, but he seems to do it naturally. It's also a story of the author learning a lot about himself by examining his own thoughts and feelings about the war.  <br /> <br />This is one of those books that you just have to be glad was written.	2005-05-13

At the Post: The 20th Century in Sports from Famed Washington Post:  Columnist Shirley Povich	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Like a visit with an old friend	For almost 75 years Shirley Povich was a fixture on the sports desk of the Washington Post. He didn't exactly invent sports reporting, but he certainly help define it in a unique way. His style of reporting, his style of writing created a respect that went beyond sports. He used the sports world as a window on the broader world of America. Sports reflected the dramatic changes in American society over the course of the twentieth century from the depression, to war, to race, to everything else.  <br /> <br />The problem with newspaper columns is that they get recycled with the rest of the paper. Only once in a while are a lifetime of columns lovingly collected by people who care (his children and a sports editor) and are published as a book.  <br /> <br />If you are familar with the original columns, here is a visit with old friends. If you have not read the originals, here is the way that sports (and maybe everything else) should be reported.  <br /> <br />This book is an absolute delight.	2005-05-12

Mobile was an important base for blockade runners, and was one of the victories that helped Lincoln be re-elected.  <br /> <br />Jack Friend has studied this battle for literally years. Among other things, he talks about just how effective the Confederate torpedoes (mines in today's terminology) really were. He begins in 1862 when Ferragut took command of the Union's West Gulf Blockading Squadron and continues through the end of the war. It covers the people, the tactics, the battle itself, the aftermath of the battle and the associated capture of Mobile.  <br /> <br />This is and will probably remain the definitive book on this battle.	2005-05-12

Enough so that you'd almost think that there are no universal rules that apply in any and all situations. Perhaps the real answer is that we are all made up of people. People are different, both the leaders and the led. Some can work well together and some simply cannot.  <br /> <br />Pat Croce's management style is one that he has developed over many years. It works wonders for him. He has also been able to convey his management style to others through writing and seminars. More than talking about management, Mr. Croce has actively seen business opportunities and exploited them by forming companies he then successfully operated and often sold for very good profits.  <br /> <br />The book has an open and casual writing style that is both entertaining and informative. If you can pick up just one tip that will work for you it is well worth the cost and the time.	2005-05-12

From ordering 435 airplanes in 1939, the US was to build 300,000 airplanes between July 1940 and August 1945. Planes are worthless without crews and the training organization expanded accordingly. Little Pyote Texas (population 100) was selected to be the site of a training base.  <br /> <br />Texas was considered to be an ideal place for a training site. Lots of land, not so many people, low elevation (relative to Nevada, Wyoming, etc.) so air is denser, good flying weather most of the time. An Army base with a few hundred people would have done great things for Pyote businesses. No one expected 40,000 people.  <br /> <br />This is the details of what happened at Pyote (and at many other sites around the west) as the Army Air Force expanded. It includes everything from the problems of inspecting the local restaurants for sanitation, to disposing of the thousands of rattlesnakes upset by the building of the base, to finally todays state of abandonded concrete and a historical market.  <br /> <br />It's a fascinating story.	2005-05-12

The looping concept of creating a small loop that can then be repeated a number of times reflected the way that much popular music is really written. That was just the beginning. ACID has now been through five major revisions, getting more powerful with each revision but retaining the basic simplicity that made the software such a hit in the first place.  <br /> <br />In this book, two consumate masters of the software have combined to produce an excellent book. This is one of those books that literally have something for everyone. On the one hand it gives tips to the newbie on things he might want to consider during installation. On the other hand, there are enough points brought out that the expert will find things that make him wonder why he didn't already know that.  <br /> <br />This book is part of the CMP Instant Series that combines screen shots with text to instantly convey the points of importance. A quick way to get started, or to learn about the latest version.	2005-05-12

S. Forester and indeed to the real world of of the Royal Navy of the time.  <br /> <br />The book is broken into sections on the major aspects of the Navy including: ships, officers, men, techniques, life at sea, enemies, the Navy in Action, and finally the experience of war.  <br /> <br />The book is a delight to read. Each of these sections contains not only information about the actual navy of the time, but also relates many of the details to particular Forester or O'Brian books. For instance the naval blockade is discussed as a tactic. Then there it talks about Hornblower having the Hotspur on blockade duty, and Aubrey being part of the Mediteranean Fleet in the book The Ionian Mission. He even mentions other novels, such as Sharpe's Trafalgar, while normally a soldiers story, Sharpe is put at Trafalgar almost as an accident.  <br /> <br />Profusely illustrated by paintings from the time, these include not only the usual outlines of ships, but of the details of the action. These include not only the use of the guns, but also of the less happy parts of the ship, like the surgeon's cockpit.  <br /> <br />It's fascinating to read just how accurately life is portrayed in fiction.	2005-05-12

Technology, and History (2 volume set)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Amazing Amount of Detail and Very Readable	I don't know when I last picked up an encyclopedia and read it cover to cover, but I did this one. It was truly fascinating in its depth and understanding. I spent more time on Volume One, Chemical and Biological Weapons because I know less about them than the Nuclear Weapons covered in Volume Two.  <br /> <br />I can't swear that the information in Volume One is totally accurate, but the information in Volume Two is dead on. And therefore I have to presume that Volume One is the same.  <br /> <br />The books cover everything from the earliest experiments and incidents to very recent data. There are hundreds of entries, each written by a specialist in that particular area. The entries on World War II alone cover an amazing amount of material that simply isn't generally known.  <br /> <br />This includes things like the Japanese Unit 731, the Porton Down research establishment in England, the production in the United States of 150,000 tons of chemical warfare agents as well as bacterial warfare agents containing some pretty nasty things like Cholera, Anthrax.  <br /> <br />Another tidbit that I didn't know -- The strain of Anthrax used in the 2001 incidents was one produced at Texas A&M for the US Army researchers. As I said, my knowledge in this area is weak. So perhaps this was more commonly known, but it was a surprise to me.  <br /> <br />On the nuclear side virtually everything is covered from the first design work in World War II to the North Korean Nuclear Weapons Program's announcements in 2002.  <br /> <br />If I have to pick out anything wrong with these books, it would be that I noticed one or two typos. And of course, I would like to see even more included, a good report on the SL-1 reactor accident for instance, the biggest (non-bomb) radiation leak in the US. To be sure you can find out about this on the web, and where do you stop when your book is already over a thousand pages.  <br /> <br />Very highly recommended.	2005-05-12

It's original and main intent is aimed at high school teachers who are preparing students for college. In this vein it addresses what should be tought to students and how they should be taught.  <br /> <br />The second goal is how to take whatever high school education a young person has and from this foundation prepare the student for what college is going to be like.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately the taking of the college preparatory curriculum in most high schools does a fairly poor job of actually preparing students for surviving in the college environment. Perhaps the knowledge the student has in math, english, or whatever is adequate. But there is still the lack of involvement on the teachers part, particularly in the large survey type classes of a hundred plus students with a TA doing the teaching. Combine this with the faster pace, the increased requirements for homework, and the outside influences away from home and the potential is there for significant problems.  <br /> <br />This book is a more basic guide than many of the college review type books that merely list some attributes of dozens of colleges. This is a guide on how to succeed rather than how to pick a college.	2005-05-12

It's about the Phoenix Initiative, an experiment in rebuilding the center of a city. In this case the city is Coventry (England). And not unlike what was done in several US cities such as Baltimore and San Antonio the results have been surprising. In each of these cities, there has been concern about protecting and in this case restoring the unique culture of the city. The center city of Coventry was a devastating raid by the Germans during the Blitz of the Second World War.   <br /> <br />The book itself is very well done. It contains a series of essays from the artistic standpoint, the architectural (from the designers), from art consultants, and even one from poet David Morley. Not a large book, it shows what can be done when people interested in a city can collaborate to produce a work of art on an urban scale.	2005-04-26

When Mr. Goebel left to join the Army Air Corps he was a high school graduate and 19 years old. When he returned after 61 combat missions and 11 victories, he was 22. I don't know just how many pilots they had by the end of the war, but it was a lot more than 2,000.  <br /> <br />Compared with most books of this type, this book has several really strong points. One is the technical aspects. The author later on got a degree in physics. He obviously had a technical view of things earlier and talks a lot about the technical aspects of flying and of the P-51. Second, he is a much better writer than most. He brings an insight to the times, the people and the overall situation far more than that expected of a youngster. Then he combines this insight with a writing stylke that says he could well have been a professional writer.	2005-04-25

I fixed that one.  <br /> <br />Later I found that my web server was using an awful lot of bandwidth, it was being used as a re-transmitter of first run movies. Then somehow one of the systems got infected with CoolWebSearch -- It was of course a new version so none of the erasing tools worked and I had to go back to an earlier state of the machine. Now somehow a popup thing is running on one of the machines that none of the anti-spyware, anti-popup software can catch. (I changed to the Firefox browser on that machine and the popups stopped, so at least I know it's an IE problem.)  <br /> <br />So now my machines are sitting behind a hardware firewall, running all kinds of anti software, and I feel pretty good. Well I felt pretty good until ... <br /> <br />Here comes this book from No Starch Press. (I find their books to be universally excellent.) It talks about a level of penetration about which I had only heard vague rumors. This book is a narrative of the web, of computer architecture, of the way protocols like TCP/IP work. It isn't so much a cookbook of how to install this piece of software to solve your problem so much as the background information on what you're dealing with. Not for beginners, this is a thoughtful, clever analysis of how things work.  <br /> <br />If you're a security type, you don't want to miss this one.	2005-04-25

And it may well be that the love is justified in this case. The mild \\"aw shucks\\" demeanor of an honest, average middle class individual thrust into crisis seen so often on the screen is reported here over and over by people who knew him during WW II. It's clear that he was no dummy, graduate of Princeton.  <br /> <br />This book though is on his wartime career. Entering the Army early in 1941 (and seeing his salary drop from $6,000 a month to $21) he was by the end of the war a seasoned bomber pilot with 20 missions behind him, including a visit to Berlin.  <br /> <br />In part this book has to concentrate on the differences a movie star has to see (the Army didn't want him killed), but most of it is on the way Jimmy Stewart handled himself in the War. It's a view of the war seen in movies like 12 O'Clock high, but this one is a personal view as seen by one man. If even half of what the book says is true, Jimmy Stewart clearly deserved his decorations.	2005-04-25

They were just in time for the sweeping social changes in this country that also began in San Francisco. The Grateful Dead may be the most lasting legacy of that time.  <br /> <br />As we look back on that time, the war protestors went away as did the war itself. The 'Free Speech' liberal movements at the colleges are no longer the news, and the colleges are just about the same as they were before. The drug culture getting started at the time has turned dirty and nasty.  <br /> <br />But for thirty years and more the band continued. This book is the untimate insiders view. Written by a founder this book tells of the bad management, drug addictions and every other imaginable problem faced by the members down through the years. The band even survived Ron 'Pigpen' McKernan's death. Still the band continued until, of course, Jerry Garcia's death in 1995, already ten years ago.	2005-04-25

This is basically an oral history of the porno movie business. The authors seemed to have talked to everyone who is anybody in the business. I guess that I find myself as fascinated with what these people have to say as anyone else. It is literally one of those books you don't want to put down.  <br /> <br />At the same time, this certainly doesn't make me think that this is in any way the kind of a business in which I would like to get involved. The story comes through that these people are just people. They happen to have a somewhat strange life. To call it unsettled would be a gross understatement.  <br /> <br />Also what comes across is what I see as a strange indictment of our society. The book starts with the Nudie-Cutie movies from just after World War II. It covers the people, the movies, the story of the move from simulated sex to nearly anything goes as the laws and the attitude of the people changed. So did the world of drugs, and AIDS.  <br /> <br />The Government aspects are quite ridiculous. Do the Christian Right really think they are going to stop anything. Of course, this is presented mostly from the viewpoint of the people in the industry, so you just get one side of the story.	2005-04-24

I've often wondered how any of us survived child hood. I had about as much trouble with school as she did, as she called it \\"The Long, Dark Night of Junior High School.\\" We didn't have a junior high school, but I certainly thought high school was a bitch.  <br /> <br />I was struck by her story of wanting to ride on the back seat of a bus. She was in the South at the time, and this forced the African American women to stand. But she didn't know. There weren't any signs, just 'everyone' knew.  Where I lived there were signs. I remember riding on a bus with our \\"negro\\" (the word at the time) baby sitter. She sat behind the sign, my brother sat just in front of her, with the sign in the middle. My brother and I played with the sign until the ultimate authority in the world, the bus driver came back and said, \\"leave the sign alone kid.\\" We sat perfectly still for the rest of the trip.  <br /> <br />This book is not a typical autobiography. It's a series of little stories from a time when the world was different. It wasn't as easy a world as one would have liked, but she made it through.  <br /> <br />My life was much the same, I wish I could write like she does.	2005-04-24

That took a little over two million men; 359,528 of whom died.  <br /> <br />Did he spark the Civil War? Certainly he was one spark. Dr. Reynolds writes that the Civil War might have been delayed, except for John Brown's murderous raids and the seizure of the federal armory at Harpers Ferry. If it had been delayed, might it not have happened?  <br /> <br />Seeding Civil Rights, OK! But if so, the growth and maturity of the Civil Rights movement took another hundred years and the actions of a lot of people.  <br /> <br />From this you can guess the tone of the book. Dr. Reynolds presents Brown as a Puritan pioneer rather than a crazed fanatic. I wonder if he would present Timothy McVeigh and the Christian Right prople who blow up women's clinics in the same way.  <br /> <br />You can certainly say that Dr. Reynolds presents a strong viewpoint almost praising John Brown, yet at the same time he does point out that the actions of John Brown would today mark him as a terrorist.	2005-04-24

Through these projects, most of the features of the program are illustrated and the reader quickly understands what the program is all about.  <br /> <br />To be sure, Cinema 4D has so many features and capabilities that they cannot all be covered in a book even twice this size. Instead the book attempts to teach the core, fundamental capablilities of the program and leave the reader to experiment with the other features by himself.  <br /> <br />The CD of the book is more complete than usual. It has a Demo version of the program for both Mac and PC. It has all the images used in the book. There are some extra tutorials that come from earlier versions of the book. These files can (mostly) be downloaded from the Maxon web site, but having them here on a CD is a lot faster and more convenient than downloading.  <br /> <br />I really like the writing style that the authors use, for me it comes across as clean, easy and yet conveys the information I wanted.	2005-04-24

Unfortunately the British and the Americans were somewhat slow to learn such co-operation. Both the RAF and the US Army Air Force had a series of generals that believed that they could win the war without the rest of the military if only they got enough heavy bombers.  <br /> <br />During the preparation before Overlord it was only with great effort that Eisenhower got them to assist in the invasion. They insisted on deep penetration raids into Germany rather than helping the ground forces. When finally ordered by higher command to assist they did so reluctantly and poorly. The beaches at Normandie were supposed to be riddled with so many bomb craters that no Germans were supposed to be left alive. Basically they missed all the beaches. Finally they were ordered to assist in the breakout from Normandy with Operation Cobra. They were to fly along a road and bomb only to the east of the road. Instead they flew across the road and the backward creap of the bombs fell on American troops. The highest ranking American general killed in the war, Lt. Gen. Lesley McNair was killed by such \\"friendly fire.\\" After that Eisenhower refused to use the heavy bombers again.  <br /> <br />Instead, Eisenhower concentrated on the use of the smaller planes of the 2nd Tactical Air Force. This book is their story.  <br /> <br />This is an absolutely beautiful book, profusely illustrated with hundreds of wartime photographs, most of which I've never seen before. Of particular interest to me were the pictures of the early Allison engined Mustang with its three bladed prop and greenhouse canopy, and of the Douglas A-20 (Boston/Havoc) bomber. Both of these were soon replaced by the Merlin engined Mustang and the A-26. But this volume of the book covers the time frame from June 1943 to June 1944, that's when these planes were in use.	2005-04-23

Instead it is a book that comes before that. It's about how to tell a story through animation. It's about the first steps that must be done right if the story is to be told at all.  <br /> <br />It all begins with the story. Without a story, animation is just a bunch of pictures. How do you make the story better? How do you make it fit animation as opposed to live action?  <br /> <br />How do you create the character? How do you make the image, the story give the character a personality? What kind of a background, a world do you design?  <br /> <br />From here the book goes through the whole production process. Once again, this is not a book on how to use a software package to produce the animation, it's a step before that. The author is a professional at film making. In addition he interviews quite a number of professionals from the major studios to get their view of the process.  <br /> <br />Finally the CD included with the book include film strips that you can use to evaluate just how well these guys did in following the precepts of the book.	2005-04-23

These are probably people who simply don't realize that damnyankee is one word. They probably don't even realize that this is a battle between the forces of good and the dark side of the force. They might, just might, you understand, even be people who say that this is only a game. I'm told that there are even people who said that who became President was more important, but I clearly don't belie that this is true, there just couldn't be such people.  <br /> <br />Well, that's the tone of the book. If you're a Yankee fan (I guess there are still a few out there), you can expect to get your bowels in an uproar by reading this book. If you're a Red Sox fan, well, the book is only simple Gospel fact, with a bit of humor thrown in.	2005-04-23

There have been several (make that many) books on Lance Armstrong and the Tour de France last July. However, for an insiders viewpoint, how can you do better than have one of his team mates write the book. From this point of view you can get a story of the personalities of the members of the team as well as an understanding of what it takes to win, even to compete at this level of competition.  <br /> <br />You also get a much better insight in what it takes to staff a team. They travel with their own chef, and of course they have to have bike mechanics. Bikes at this level are not the simple fat tire Schwinn's that never required any maintenance.  <br /> <br />Now that the next racing season is beginning, and Lance Armstrong has already announced that this is his last Tour de France, this book provides an insight that will make the next season more enjoyable.	2005-04-23

A collision of U.S. Navy and Imperial Navy carriers in the wake of the invasion of Guadalcanal--whose airfield the United States desperately needed and the Japanese desperately wanted back--the battle was waged at sea and over Guadalcanal's besieged Marine-held Lunga Perimeter on August 24, 1942.  <br /> <br />These battles were the result of the US deciding to draw the line in the pacific at the Solomons. If the Japanese had been able to complete the airfield on Guadalcanal, their planes would have been able to prevent the sailing of ships to Australia via the Pacific. So it was here that the Americans drew the line. Before the Guadalcanal battle the Americans fought the Battle of the Coral Sea stopping the Japanese southern advance.  <br /> <br />Remember that this was a time before the Americans brought out their newer aircraft. This battle was fought with Wildcats against Zeros. And the dive bombers were the old SBD Dauntless.  <br /> <br />This is not a history of Guadalcanal or of the overall place of this battle in the war, it is as the title says, a description of the carrier vs. carrier battles. This is only part of the story, but it is well told here.  <br /> <br />Not a companion book, but anyone interested in the stopping of the Japanese advances should also read the new Australian book \\"A Bastard of a Place.\\" This covers the stopping of the Japanese advance across Papua New Guina a fierce and deciscive battle little known in the US.	2005-04-22

Hitler particularly used a philosophy of divide and separate power so that no single organization can rise up against him. In the case of the SS, the top recruits, the most dedicated, motivated went into the SS. They then got first call on the best of the new equipment. Because of Germany's limited resources, this really strapped some of the regular army divisions.  <br /> <br />This book covers the way the SS got started, it's pre-war activities, and finally it's getting started as a military organization. It talks about the special qualifications necessary to get into the SS and finally concentratates on it activities during the war. Most of the book is on the straight military operations of the SS, although the fact that this is where the concentration camp guards came from is certainly discussed.  <br /> <br />I find one picture quite confusing. On page 76 there are two soldiers said to be from the Totenkopf division keeping watch. Yet the rifle being held by one of the soldiers appears to me to be a Russian Tokarev M1940. I wonder if the picture is incorrectly identified, of if these troups have liberated a Russian rifle.  <br /> <br />This is the most complete and throrough history of the SS I have ever seen.	2005-04-22

In reading this book I can see why it was so ugly. The original specifications issued by the navy were that two airplanes had to fit on the elevator of the Essex class carriers. This made the plane shorter than it should have been and resulted in the short, fat look of the plane. This caused instability in flight that really didn't get resolved until the -4 and -5 revisions. By then it had turned into quite an airplane, finally living up to its expectations and replacing the much older SBD.<br /><br />Peter Smith obviously loves the plane and has collected an amazing amount of material to write about and photographs to include in this book. He of course covers the use of the plane by the US Navy, but also talks about the Army version (A-25 Shrike) which was developed but fell into disfavor because the USAAF didn't want a dive bomber. Some interesting politics in this area.<br /><br />This is probably the best written, most complete single airplane book I've read. But I still think the Helldiver was ugly.	2005-04-22

Further, there is a track on the CD that comes with the book that has this bird's song recorded. It's not exactly like the bird outside the window, but birds (I've learned) are individuals too.  <br /> <br />Birding is one of the more popular pastimes in this country, and growing quire rapidly.

And they did a supurb job there. The stories of Montgomery's success over Rommel is filled with the Australians did this, and the Australians did that.  <br /> <br />But then came Pearl Harbor and the Japanese expansion to the south and east. The Japanese expanded to the Solomons in the east. To the south the Japanese landed on and controlled the northern coast of the island of Papua New Guinea. Their intent was to have their army march southward to meet a naval force going around the island. From there was the possibility of invading Australia.  <br /> <br />To the east the Americans drew the line by establishing a series of bases in the New Hebrides. First the American Navy fought a battle with this Japanese naval force, it is called the battle of the Coral Sea. Then the Americans invaded the Japanese conquered Solomon Islands to prevent the Japanese from building an air base at a place called Guadalcanal. The Japanese got no further east.  <br /> <br />No less important, but almost unknown here in the United States was the fighting in  The Australians held the southern. In between lay the Kododa trail. It was indeed a Bastard of a Place. It's still a bitch of a place just to walk it without being burdened with equipment and someone trying to kill you.  <br /> <br />The Australians wanted their army back from North Africa, the British said \\"No.\\" So the Australians had to fight the battle with militia and conscripts. They did, and they won. They pushed the Japanese back to the northern coast and with a series of other battles kicked them off of the island completely. From here the march northward began.  <br /> <br />During this time Dougout Doug MacAuthor was in Australia issuing press releases about how great he was doing. There was almost nothing in the American press about the Kokoda trail.  <br /> <br />This book, written in Australia, is very well researched and very well written. It deserves wide distribution in the US to bring an understanding that the entire Pacific was wasn't won entirely by the U.S. Marines.	2005-04-22

This book is a collection of his essays, mostly on baseball and its players, but fifty years of writing is a lot of writing. Here are his writing on many, many other people, other activities. Still, this is Roger Kahn, even the baseball stories make you remember that baseball players are still people.  <br /> <br />The short (5 page) Chapter 17 is on Joe DiMaggio's marriage to Marilyn Monroe. It brings a great sadness. This kind of reaching for the emotions is a thing that Roger Kahn does better than just about anyone else. He is able to look beyond the superstar personna to the peson underneath and then to bring this person to life using just the printed word.  <br /> <br />The really good thing about books like this is that they mean that the words printed in a newspaper that will be thrown away the next day remain available.

In 1918, 675,000 Americans died of the flu. In all, the flu killed some 50,000,000 peopleapproximately the same number killed in World War II (no one knows exactly how many in either the flu or WW II).  <br /> <br />In 1918 the medical profession was confident that they understood how disease was spread. In 1878 Louis Pasteur had published his breakthrough book \\"Germ Theory and Its Applications to Medicine and Surgery.\\" (Note that the publication date is well after the American Civil War where the doctors knew nothing about germs. This book is available free from [...]) While this was not immediately accepted by the medical profession, by 1918 it was understood, accepted and tought in medical school.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately flu is not caused by germs but a virus, and in 1918 they knew nothing of viruses. And it wasn't until World War II that penicillin, the first effective anti-bacterial was discovered. While this wouldn't have stopped a virus, it is likely that it would have stopped the pneumonia that followed the virus and was the actual killer of most people.  <br /> <br />Can it happen again? Yes! AIDS infects about 36 million people and is now killing them at about a million people a year. And both of these numbers are increasing.  <br /> <br />This is a powerful book that covers an area of history that it seems was almost deliberately covered up by the Government, the media, and the historians. Highly recommended.	2005-04-21

His is a story of undue harassment by southern students, and a strength that I don't think I would have had. It's a story worth telling and well told in this new book.  <br /> <br />What the book doesn't mention is that after graduating Mr. Brown remained in the Navy until he retired in 1969 as  Lt.

But I don't think I've ever read one that was 880 pages long. Then again, this one was about the 82 Airborne.  <br /> <br />The 82nd was Sergeant Alvin York's division in World War II, and was reactivated as an airborne unit during WW II. The European theater of operations in WW II was just about a \\"You name it, the 82nd was there.\\"  <br /> <br />This book picks up the story of the 82nd when Omar Bradley and Matthew Ridgway were assigned to form up the division. When you start a unit with men of that caliber and the unit is all volunteers you can expect good things. One of the first things they did was to invite Sgt. York to visit the division and make a speech.  <br /> <br />Of course after the speech the training was hard, then later the fighting was hard. The unit was first in action in the med, then came Overlord, Market Garden, and the Bulge.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the most famous story of the 82nd came from the bulge.  <br /> <br />As a tank destroyer from the 7th Armored Division moved west from Salmchateau on the highway toward Fraiture, the commander spotted a lone trooper from the 325th digging a foxhole for an outpost near the road. The commander stopped the vehicle and asked him if this was the frontline.  <br /> <br />The trooper, PFC Vernon L. Haught, with Company F, looked up and said, \\"Are you looking for a safe place?\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Yeah.\\"  <br /> <br />Haught then said, \\"Well buddy, just pull your vehicle behind me. I'm the 82nd Airborne, and this is as far as the bastards are going.\\"  <br /> <br />My only complaint, the author refers a lot to the 82nd as being the premier combat division. My uncle, who was with the 101st at Bastogne, just might have taken exception to that.  <br /> <br />Great Book!	2005-04-21

Most of the time the police get involved at the end, usually finding the wrong man. None the less, the stories do an excellent job of describing how \\"aggressive\\" network defenders might attempt to strike back at attackers. These stories are certainly a more interesting approach than the typical computer manual.  <br /> <br />The second part of the manual gets more technical and describes in greater depth the tools and techniques that the defenders in the fictional stories use.  <br /> <br />The whole book brings up a series of moral questions.

Most of the problems got solved, several by the invention of new fields of mathematics. Problem Number 8 was simply \\"Prove the Riemann Hypothesis.\\" It wasn't solved. (To see the other 22, do a Google Search.)  <br /> <br />Riemann wrote a short paper on prime numbers stating his hypothesis. He then became very ill and died at the age of thirty-nine. The proof has remained elusive for a century and a half. While watching the play \\"Proof\\" I found myself wondering if this was the \\"Proof\\" in the play.  <br /> <br />This book is the story of the recent attempts to prove Riemann's hypothesis.

This part of his story is broken into two parts, the first part of the book begins when he bails out of his P-40 over what is now Vietnam and talks about his three years as a prisoner of the Japanese, his subsequent escape and return to the U.S. This part was written by Lew Bishop.  <br /> <br />The second part goes back to his earlier life both in the United States and his activities in China. Remember that this was before the U.S. actually entered the war. The Flying Tigers, technically called the American Volunteer Group (AVG), were American military pilots who left the American military with the promise that they could return with senority continuing through their Chinese service. They were sort of mercenaries, sort of part of the Chinese Air Force, and sort of a covert action of the United States.  <br /> <br />While this part of the book is not unlike others on the Flying Tigers, it is very well done and has numerous side panels that provide very informative insight into points like Roosevelt's role in the establishment of the AVG, the theories of Gen. Chennault and the way he was treated by the military establishment (the military does not treat original thinkers very well, and even worse when they are proven correct).  <br /> <br />Finally the third part of the book goes into life after Lew Bishop returned to the U.S. This is a story of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder before we even knew what it was. Mr. Bishop was never really able to put his life back into order. The effect on his life and that of his daughter (who wrote the rest of this book) is described tenderly and with insight.  <br /> <br />Really not until after Mr. Bishop's death did his daughter begin the 'journey of discovery' (raising three boys of her own took a lot of her time) that led to this book. I, for one, am glad that she made the journey and that she has shared it with us.	2005-04-20

His neighbor told him that he was breaking Federal law.  The neighbor then said that if the Feds came around he would lie for him and give him an alibi.  <br /> <br />Then on Page 4 Britain's Royal Astronomer suggested that in addition to changing the clocks that the thermometer should be put up ten degrees in the winter so we would be warmer.  <br /> <br />I was hooked.  <br /> <br />The conclusions of the book: nobody knows why we have it, nobody can prove any savings (or cost).  <br /> <br />My real conclusions on this book. Be prepared to laugh. (I also found it necessary to telephone people and read them parts of it.)	2005-04-19

The United States assigned Allen Dulles as their chief spy master. Allen Dulles was later to become head of the CIA.  <br /> <br />Being neutral also did not mean that the Swiss were safe from Germany. This book reports on the actions of the Swiss intelligence services during WW II, and particularily on the communications channel between the head of Swiss Intelligence and General Schellenberg of German SS Foreign Intelligence.  <br /> <br />One interesting story was about Germany's Case Switzerland, the planned invasion of Switzerland. At one time in 1943 it appeared that this plan was under serious discussion in Germany and the Swiss Army went on heightened alert.  <br /> <br />Another of the things that I find amazing about this book is that it is, in part, based on previously unknown American documents. It makes you wonder just what other unknown American documents exist.	2005-04-19

This book is the story of her wartime career from launching in San Francisco through her nine month career. Yes, nine months, launched December 10, 1944, she fought in the South Pacific until hit by a kamikaze at Okinawa. She struggled back to the Philadelphia Navy yard and was in the process of extensive rebuilding when the war ended and such a damaged ship was no longer needed by the Navy.  <br /> <br />The crowning point of the England's career was the record it set for killing six enemy submarines in twelve days. This was enough to make the Navy use her name on a guided-missile cruiser (CG-22) to keep the history alive.  <br /> <br />The author was exec and then commander of the England during her short life. He writes a tale of navy life during the war that is fascinating and interesting.	2005-04-19

This is different from Cryptography in which the secret message is converted to what looks like a meaningless jumble of characters.  <br /> <br />Example: You mail a letter. It currently takes 37 cents in postage. Instead of using a 37 cent stamp you use stamps of the following values: 9 cents, 2 cents, 3 cents, 1 cent, 9 cents, 4 cents, 9 cents. That's the right amount of postage so the letter goes through. But the letter is meaningless. The message you sent is 9-2-3-1-9-4-9. Perhaps this means September 23, 1949, or perhaps it's comething else that the receiver understands. Or perhaps the message is in the green ink that you used to address the envelope.  <br /> <br />When you get to computers you can be far, far more secretive. A movie or audio file can be millions of bytes long. Changing a few bits here or there would be completely undetectable but could incorporate a huge message.  <br /> <br />This book is intended to be a guide to law enforcemtn investigators and cyber-forensics. It describes the techniques and the literally dozens of programs that exist (usually free on the web) for hiding messages and several programs for detecting these messages. This is an area that has received little attention in the past and this book does a very good job of bringing this field out into the open.	2005-04-19

I've got a lot of things to do myself, more than I can get done today. And then the time comes when you have to stop being busy, some times you just have to sit and let the batteries recharge. As the old saying goes, sometimes I sits and thinks, and sometimes I just sits.  <br /> <br />And the question has to come up of what can one person, you or me do to make the community we live in a better place. Suzanne Morse's book can't tell you what you can do. But it can tell you what other people like you have done. Will her ideas work in New York City, no. Will they work on the block you live in within New York City, in the neighborhood you live in, yes.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile I've got to quit writing about this book. I'm going help the local community theater try to get started. I don't know anything about theater, but I can find some way to help, even if it's just sweeping the floor.	2005-04-19

Most of them talk about the options we have available. And there are a lot of options, from nursing homes to taking the parent into your own home.  <br /> <br />What there isn't much about how we feel when we have to to this. I know of very few people who reached adulthood without having unresolved issues with their parents. (As one book says, all families are dysfunctional.) When the parent gets older, becomes in many ways a child again, all this old baggage you thought you'd gotten rid of is brought out of the obsure storage room where you put it.  <br /> <br />This book is not on taking care of your parents. It's on taking care of you when you have to take care of them.  <br /> <br />If you are facing, or will be facing the problem of elderly parents, you owe it to yourself to read this book. It just may save your marriage, your sanity.	2005-04-18

In the earliest cave man days it was learned that fastening a rock to the end of a stick made a club, or if sharpened an axe. But it is only in the 1900's that the man machine interface began to be really complex. And it was only in the late 1900's that serious work began on how best to handle this interface.<br /><br />This book was written by pioneers in the field and offers a principled approach to studying human work with complex technology. It describes a conceptual framework for analysis and concrete methods for the design of man machine interfaces where the amount of information to be transfered between man and machine can be analyzed and structured for its best effect.<br /><br />This book takes a rather theoretical approach to the problem giving few concrete examples. It seems destined to become a clasic in the field.	2005-04-18

Over time the procedures have changed, the reverence and dignity shown to the dead and to their survivors has increased. The amount of effort expended to find and identify any remains has grown significantly down through the years to include the latest scientific techniques. We have come a long way since the soldiers at Cold Harbor wrote their names on pieces of paper and attached them to their backs for later identification purposes.  <br /> <br />This book is the story of how the American military treats their dead. It is a book filled with pathos intermixed with cold facts. Some of the stories told reflect the horror of the situations, some tell of times when the procedures failed and the survivors were not treated as well as they could have been. After all, the military is filled with people just like the rest of us, some less capable than others.  <br /> <br />To go with this book there are a couple of other recommendations: First the book: 'Shane Comes Home',the true story of the return of a body from Iraq. Second the movie 'Saving Private Ryan' which is based on a true story of one GI returned from combat after all of his brothers were killed, and showes the effort that the military can expend. <br /> <br />I really don't know how to rate this book. It is supurb in what it does, but what it does not not very plesant.	2005-04-18

And among the subjects it teaches is leadership. The Army teaches leadership at all levels from the squad leader with only a few subordinates to generals with hundreds of thousands. With many years of studying leadership, the Army program nets down to the three words in the title of the book:  <br /> <br />Be - To be an effective leader you have to be the kind of person people want to follow. This comes down to almost the Golden rule, Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Other words would be loyalty, integrity, personal courage; a good set of personal qualities that make a good person.  <br /> <br />Know - You have to know what you are asking subordinates to do. It's hard to lead people into doing things that you can't do yourself.   <br /> <br />Do - The old adage, Follow Me, summarizes the leaders point of view. You have to do, you have to show the way.  <br /> <br />This book is different from many that are available on bookstore shelves. Most books are written by consultants or trainers that have developed their own programs. This book takes as its foundatation what the Army has developed over meany, many years, practiced, and observed the result. The study of the results of leadership training in the Army is based on combat where the losers die, not just watching the sales charts.  <br /> <br />This book is different, but directly applicable to the business, research, academic world.	2005-04-18

It has become part of our lives in a way that subsequent wars cannot. It was a war of emmense porportions, truly a world war fought in every time zone the world has.  <br /> <br />Yet, in a city of monuments there was no memorial to this war for sixty years. Finally, on May 29, 2004 this memorial was finally dedicated in the middle of the Washington Mall.  <br /> <br />This small book (exceedingly well bound to give it a long life in a library) is designed to assist children to understand the cultural importance of this war. While not the war to end all wars, this war probably marks the end of huge superpower wars. With atomic weapons, such wars as this could never be fought without ending life as we know it.	2005-04-18

This is one.  <br /> <br />Suppose you have a plant, corn let's say. Someone then delivers to you another variety of corn that has some valuable characteristic: resistance to disease, ability to grow with less water or in a salty soil. But the new corn doesn't produce as high a yield as the corn you have. You take this new variety, isolate the gene that provides this capability and merge it with your older variety to produce a new strain that combines the good features of both.  <br /> <br />The Biodiversity Convention obliges a signatory state to ensure that suppliers of genetic and biochemical resources receive \\"a just and equitable\\" share of the profits that accrue from the comemrcialization of their resources.  <br /> <br />To be absolutely fair and follow the law to the limit, how much do you owe to whom? What should the collector of the variety get? The owner of the property on which it is found? The country in which it is found? And oh yes, the United States is not a signatory nation to the convention.  <br /> <br />This fascinating book opens a wide variety of questions, and in doing so explains a lot about biodiversity that I never knew.	2005-04-18

As a result of questions and comments from readers he has produced this guide to specifically address how to overcome these dysfunctions.  <br /> <br />The particular points beind addressed include:  <br /> <br />Building Trust  <br />Mastering Conflict  <br />Achieving Commitment  <br />Embracing Accountability  <br />Focusing on Results.  <br /> <br />Each of these points is discussed with a view towards increasing the functionality of the team.

In spite of all the warnings most companies ignore the pleadings of the assigned security specialist until all of a sudden they are hit in the face with a penetration. And this is the theme of the introductory chapter, except that he explains it a lot better.  <br /> <br />The second chapter starts with an explanation of John The Ripper. This is a program that attempts to automatically crack your system's password file. (The John The Ripper program is included on the books CD so you can use it to test your own system.)  <br /> <br />By this point he had my attention. It was clear that if he wished he could get into my system and do whatever he wished. I interrupted my reading at this point and changed several system passwords to make them a lot more difficult.  <br /> <br />After that I went on to read the rest of the book on finding, fixing and preventing holes in a Linux network. I never realized it was so easy.  <br /> <br />The book is a combined explanation of what's happening and a wealth of software on the CD. This software, described in the text part of the book, is a selection of software off of the net. The net has a huge amount of software available. Here the author has selected a dozen or so packages that he discusses enough for you to use and to have some faith that the results you are getting are worthwhile.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the best book on Linux security ever.	2005-04-18

You don't notice at first that the image is printed over a rounded corner purple diamond shape that just happens to be the shape and color of the Viagra tablet. That sets the tone of the book.  <br /> <br />I think I have a new hero. I really learned some things about how I could have worked less hard. His technique was to sleep late, get started about noon, quit early. I was more of a morning person, go to work early, call the boss promptly, then take off in the middle of the day to play with the baby, before calling in just before quitting time. I was in a different industry, but most of the secrets are the same. I can remember ... but that has nothing to do with reviewing the book.  <br /> <br />This basically is how business is done in the United States, and probably in the world. There's more money in marketing than there is in R&D. The success of a new (or old) product depends more on sales and perception than it does on the product. And while this book is on drugs, I can assure you that selling computers (my field) and probably everything else is just about the same.  <br /> <br />If you're a youngster reading this, you may want to read this book pretty closely. It might be why you should go into sales. Now that he's a writer, the author will probably have to work a lot harder.	2005-04-18

And to survive (perhaps thrive would be a better world) in the next century you need to ask  <br />Can someone overseas do it cheaper?  <br />Can a computer do it faster?  <br />Do the goods and services I offer satisfy one of the nonmaterial desires of an abundant age?  <br /> <br />Yes, we are in a period of abundance.  <br />Yes, Asian manufacturing is replacing western manufacturing (and will in turn be replaced by even cheaper places like Africa).  <br />Yes, automation is encroaching on traditional manufacturing.  <br />Yes, the schools in Asia are turning out extremely competent programmers, engineers, even research scientists (just look at the number of patents issued to Japanese companies).  <br /> <br />His conclusion is that 'right-brained' people are needed in the emerging economy. <br /> <br />Two problems:  <br /> <br />Asian people have right brains too. There elements of design, music, and so on are good too.  <br /> <br />But the biggest problem with the book can be found by examining the Index. Go down to the \\"O's\\" and you find \\"Ohga, Norio\\" followed by \\"Olivier, Richard.\\" There's something missing here -- the word \\"Oil.\\"  <br /> <br />Anyone who hasn't considered the upcoming changes being brought up us by the decreasing availability of and increasing demand for oil hasn't finished his thinking.  <br /> <br />For instance:  <br />Abundance - How much of abundance comes from plastic. What happens when plastic goes up 1000% in price?  <br />Asia - it's a long way to ship things, and transportation is going to get much more expensive.  <br />Automation is a tricky thing. At one time big factories were highly automated to build computer motherboards. They were so difficult to change that they were abandoned and motherboards arenow produced semi-automatically at best.  <br /> <br />Conclusion: Good book in forcing you to think about the future, but it's only half done. Replacing oil is going to take a lot of left brain work.	2005-04-17

We are now cloning higher animals like horses and sheep. There have been cases of parents having another child in hopes of getting an organ to save their first born. Is it far (technically) to clone a human for their organ content?  <br /> <br />Ethically is an entirely different matter. And somehow the photograph of the beautiful young girl on the front cover just adds to the feeling of unease. Of course the gender of the clone would make no difference ethically, but emotionally the photograph pulls heart strings, especially to those of us who are male but have daughters. <br /> <br />As for the story itself. It is written as a voyage of discovery. The characters don't know what they are in for and the knowledge builds slowly. This is magnified by the use of terms like being a 'carer' before you become a 'doner.'	2005-04-17

The two authors were high level research people doing some of the fundamental algorithms used by McAfee. This book describes how the bad guys use various tools and programming techniques to get into systems.  <br /> <br />Unlike many security oriented books, this one is not a simple how do you install an anti-virus program. It is written at the fundamental levels given in the title. While there is a quick chapter that talks about programming, this is of more use to people who already know programming than the beginner. This book also talks about the security problems in Java and BSD Unix besides just the common Windows platforms.  <br /> <br />It will be interesting to see if the bad guys are so successful that people stop using commonly available software and revert to something else. For instance I was having quite a problem with Internet Explorer showing PopUps. None of the anti-adware packages could clean it up. I switched to another browser (Firefox) just to get away from the heavily attacked Microsoft products.	2005-04-17

It is intended for upper level undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics, computer science and engineering. I suspect only the quite mathematically inclined computer science and engineering students will find this book helpful. This is not a Boy Scout how to do secret messages book, but a book that will give the professional the data needed to implement cryptographic software, and the mathematician hints on both code breaking and creating.      This is the third edition of this book. With the second edition, the author got rid of several several subjects that were not right at the core of cryptography, with the intend of doing a second volume. Instead, the art and scienct of cryptography has changed so fast during the past few years that a two volume approach isn't practical. Instead, he has produced this third edition that picks back up many of the subjects from the first edition. All of the material in this edition has been extensively re-written to incorporate the latest theories and practices.     In recent years the use of cryptography has increased by several orders of magnitude. Every time we buy something with a credit card, use on line banking, send a password to access e-mail, we use cryptography. With this growth, the interest at software companies, universities, and other places has grown accordingly and this text has become the standard by which others are compared.     Highly recommended for the serious student.	2005-04-17

To be sure it isn't complete, perhaps Ms. MacDonald can be persuaded to do a similar book on the French and American activities in the Great War. Come to think of it, some more books on the air war and the sea war would be nice as well.   <br /> <br />I can't call this a history exactly, it is instead a series of letters, recordings, and reports from the people who were there. I suspect that a lot of these came from the Imperial War Museum which is creating a collection of such things.   <br /> <br />What I really can't imagine is where she was able to contain the huge number of truly amazing photographs. So many pictures you see of that war are reprints from a magazine and show the moire patters of being re-scanned, these do not.  <br /> <br />This has to be one book in your collection on the Great War, but I think you will find it to be a book that you pull down quite often, if for no other reason than the photographs.	2005-04-17

In this case, a young man finally marries after searching for Miss Right for many years, only to tragically lose her. After two years he finds other people in his life falling apart. And at the same time begins to straighten out his own life.  <br /> <br />Written by one of England's best up and coming writers this is not exactly a new concept, but in his hands there is wit, wisdom, love and recovery. It is most interesting in that this theme is more often handled from the female point of view, but not in this case. It's an exploration of men's feelings that is much less commonly seen.  <br /> <br />Yes, men have feelings too. But as one writer said, men tend to put their feelings in a room, close the door to the room and not visit it very often. This book is a refreshing change.	2005-04-16

Combine this with the title 'Beginning Programming' and you have a pretty good idea of what's it all about.  <br /> <br />This book is also set up to allow you to get into programing cheaply. It programs its examples using C++, Java, VBScript and JavaScript (along with a few references to other languages). These languages are available free for downloading over the internet. You also do not need a big, super powerful computer to do programming. Indeed, most of my own programming is done on an old Pentium II - 400 MHz machine that I bought for $55 (well, to be truthful, I added another $15 in memory).  <br /> <br />Finally, as the authors point out, after you learn one language you know enough about the general structure of programming to be readily able to move to another language. After a couple of weeks working with this book, you could move up to another language in probably a couple of days.  <br /> <br />This is indeed the simple way to get started in programming. I wish I'd had it when I started forty something years ago.	2005-04-15

There are an even hundred hacks that cover all areas from setting up projects to extending and enhancing Visual Studio.  <br /> <br />At its core, Visual Studio is just an editor, but it is quite a powerful editor with numerous features to increase productivity. There is a chapter and ten hacks on the editor section alone. And there are two additional chapters on Navigating and Customizing the editor to make it do things easier, faster or simply more suited to the way you choose to work.  <br /> <br />Finally there is a discussion on various types of third party add-ins that can be used to further extend the feature set. It is a great relief to have someone else test the add-in before you spend time finding out that it doesn't do what's advertised.  <br /> <br />Anyone who uses Visual Studio without reading this book periodically is not working as efficiently as he could. O'Reilly does professional quality books for professional programmers, this one is true to their heritage.	2005-04-15

And what literature exists has largely concentrated on the irregular forces operating in Northern Arkansas. Even most of the Trans-Mississippi forces were used in other places (Such as the Louisiana Tigers fighting at Antietam where they suffered 61% casualties.).  <br /> <br />After the attack on Fort Sumter in 1861 the Governor of Texas authorized the raising of regiments for the new Confederate Government. The Twelfth Texas Cavalry under Colonel William Henry Parsons was one such unit. Their first battle was against a foraging party on May 19. This was a battle of little overall consequence, but it was the first, and it was a victory.  <br /> <br />From then on until 1865 the Texans were constantly on the move around Arkansas. The book consists mostly of copies of orders and reports that cover the movements of the unit. It is fascinating to see the level of detail that illustrates what a military unit of the time was doing. An amazing amount of effort was spent on foraging for supplies, buying horses, sending men to perform some task or whatever. A surprisingly small amount of time was actually spent fighting. These combined documents present a direct first hand account of the activities of a unit.  <br /> <br />These documents are a direct representation of primary sources, transcribed from the original hand written documents.	2005-04-15

Perhaps that was because he never became president. He couldn't be president since he wasn't born in the United States. He claimed to have been born on Nevis, an island in the Caribbean.  We wax elequently about Jefferson, Washington and the others, and if we remember Hamilton at all we remember just two things.  <br /> <br />First Hamilton fought with Jefferson over the power of the central government -- Jefferson was a southern plantation owning slave holder; Hamilton was a New Yorker opposed to slavery.  <br /> <br />We remember that Aaron Burr killed Hamilton in a duel, but we don't know why.  <br /> <br />This splendid book presents Hamilton in an entirely different light, one who forsaw the development of the United States as a world super power and was creating the governmental institutions to allow it to become so. I wonder what he would think of the Federal Government of today, where Congress is just voting to get involved in a simple right to die case in Florida.	2005-04-15

The exception is that all of the text is in French.  <br /> <br />Back in about 1970 the Germans and the Americans decided to work together to build a new tank that was going to be the absolute state of the art. The resulting tank the MBT 70 wasn't liked by anybody. It was too heavy, too expensive, too everything. So the partnership split apart with the Americans proceeding to design the Abrams M1 and the Germans the Leopard I. I believe that both of these tanks were heavier and more expensive than the MBT 70, but that's another story.  <br /> <br />This book is the story of the Leopard I, from its design to actual use. It covers the various models that were built to come up with the final design, the optional features that various countries have used, and finally a summary of all of the countries that have used the tank.  <br /> <br />The book is beautifully printed, with probably a couple of hundred color photographs. I wish I read French better than I do. I must say that the book I have has a different front cover than the one pictured at Amazon, but it has the same ISBN.	2005-04-15

Think of it this way: It's bigger than the domestic box office of the film industry. The amount of time spent playing games by young people now exceeds everything but television in time spent on entertainment. The main factor driving the development of the new extremely powerful computers is gaming, slower machines are capable of handling almost all office tasks.  <br /> <br />The authors of this book have a great deal of experience in both designing games and teaching how to design games. This has given them an understanding of how beginning designers grasp the structured elements of games, common traps they fall into, and certain developmental exercises that help the student learn to make better games.  <br /> <br />Note that this is not a programming manual, nor is it a graphics design manual. It is on game design. What are the characteristics that make a game, how can you prototype and play test the game without a horrendous programming expense, and finally some input on the game industry and how to decide on how you might like to be employeed in that industry.	2005-04-14

This is a fantastic collection of portraits shot with low light to illustrate just what is possible when you know what you are doing. And the discussion (including light placement drawings) describe what Mr. Phillips was doing when he took the picture.  <br /> <br />I think the section on photographing children (the biggest market for portrait photography) is worth the cost of the book all by itself. The originality he shows in making a truly memorable picture of the kids is just great. I never imagined some of the things he shows as a way of getting the best out of the kids.  <br /> <br />Second to the kids section is the wedding photography section. Here as well he shows an originality in posing as well as in lighting.  <br /> <br />All in all, this is an excellent book.	2005-04-14

The traditional poses of GrandMa's pictures just won't do in today's market.  <br /> <br />Second, he points out that the only reason for taking a portrait is to produce a picture that the customer likes, that's the only way you can make any money.  <br /> <br />Third, is the understanding that there is nothing wrong with any pose if that's what the customer wants. That is, treat the customer with respect.  <br /> <br />Finally there are some very interesting hints, in taking a picture of a girl on a motorcycle, he also took a picture of just her face. The comment is made that the girl wants the picture of the bike, but the picture of just her face appeals to older people such as her parents. That's an easy way to make additional money out of the same basic setting.  <br /> <br />You may not like all the poses given her, but if the book gives you just one or two ideas for your next portrait shoot, it is well worth it's low cost and the time it takes to read it.	2005-04-14

He fathered fifteen children, six of whom were daughters, this is their story.  <br /> <br />The King's growing madness is heavily emphasized in this story. And this is fitting because this was a growing part of the lives of the children. Ms. Fraser did a remarkable job with this book. It is based on the extensive letters between Queen Charlotte and the six girls. It is not a typical biography talking of the major events of King George's rule, it is the personal story of this group of women trying to live a semi-normal life amidst life at the court.  <br /> <br />It is a fascinating book that looks at a time far removed from ours.	2005-04-14

However, the DSM is a lot of book to carry around, is somewhat difficult to use, and costs a bunch. Although the authors say nothing about this, I find this book to be almost a mini version of the DSM. If you're looking up a personality disorder just to refresh your thinking, it's here. If you want a quick survey of medications, it's here.  <br /> <br />The intent of the book is to be a review for USMLE, Steps 2&3 as well as an introductory text to a clerkship. It's a small book, easy to understand, and extremely complete for what it is intended to do. ==Highly Recommended.	2005-04-14

Palace upon arrival. Once there you would meet Dorothy McKibbin. She would give you a badge and arrange transportation up a thirty five mile treacherous, twisting mountain road to a place where your working companions were as rarified as the high desert atmostphere.  <br /> <br />This was a time when the changes in the world of physics were exploding. And of all the changes, those being made at Los Alamos were the greatest. This book, told through the eyes of Dorothy McKibbin, written by the granddaughter of the head of the project, comes out in Robert Oppenheimer's centennial year.  <br /> <br />In today's revisionist history mood, some people lament the dropping of the bomb. They forget the feelings in this country going back to Pearl Harbor. They also ignore the fact that if the Germans had been successful in driving the D-Day invasion back into the sea or at the Battle of the Bulge, the first to receive Atomic Honor would likely have been Berlin.  <br /> <br />Splendid Book.	2005-04-14

Robert Oppenheimer	Books	5	11	15	N	N	The Story of a Flawed Genius	You may remember that Prometheus was the god who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to mortal men. A fitting way to describe Oppenheimer who took the nuclear fire from the Sun and gave it to mankind.  <br /> <br />2004 was the centennial of Oppenheimer's birth, and this is one of the new biographies published about him. Unlike some of the others, this book is more about the person Oppenheimer rather than the development of the bomb. He was a complex person. One of the more brilliant men of our time, he was both a theoretical physicist and an extremely capable manager of the biggest scientific project of the century.  <br /> <br />A good bit of this book is on his later life, particularly the incident where his security clearance was revoked and the subsequent years until his death (throat cancer, a chain smoker)  <br /> <br />There is also some considerable discussion about the use of the bomb against Japan. Yet, can you imagine the public reaction if the invasion of Japan (Operation Olympic, scheduled for Nov. 1, 1945) had taken place and had indeed cost a million American lives when the public learned that the bomb existed and had not been used.	2005-04-14

This book goes into much greater depth than these, not on specific incidents, but on the organization of MI-6 and how it has attempted to provide its customers (other Government agencies) with the information they need. <br /> <br />An organization like MI-6 or the CIA is going to evolve over time. And this book is broken down by time. These are:  <br /> <br />Beginning to First World War, 1918  <br />Inter War Years, 1919-39  <br />World War II Years, 1939-45  <br />Cold War, 1946-56  <br />End of Cold War and After, 1956-95  <br />And finally a chapter on the machinery.  <br /> <br />There is also a few pages in the introduction comparing the British philosophy of intelligence with that of the American CIA. All in all, while based on open information, this is just about the most complete stucy of MI-6 ever made. It makes fascinating reading.	2005-04-13

He looks at our present lives and sees things that most of us miss. And in this book he is looking at the impact of the media (mostly television) on our society and that of the world. And to a surprising extent, the impact of the media controlls the world.  <br /> <br />The media controls what we see. For instance the United States media talks about each American soldier killed in Iraq. Yes, that's a tragedy. But what about the 125 people a day dying in automobile accidents in the US alone. What about the almost 3,000 people a day who die from AIDS. They aren't news.  <br /> <br />I live in a small town; far, far away from the centers of power, of media. I'd kind of like to know what's going on in the world, not have some puffy haired guy talk to me endlessly about a rock star on trial, or a right to die case. But of these things we have no power. We listen to what the media wants to tell us.  <br /> <br />A great book that talks about the changes that TY and the Net have brought to us.	2005-04-13

Dr. White clearly knows whereof he speaks. While I'm sure that he wouldn't use actual patient data, he would have a better understanding of how people really behave than most of us.  <br /> <br />The hero of his books (this is the 13th) is psychologist Alan Gregory. This time the book starts with the death of a colleague dead, and under mysterious circumstances. After this, various people start going missing, including a neighbor and former friend of JonBenet Ramsey who vanishes without a trace eight-years to the day after the real-life tragedy.  <br /> <br />Characteristics of Dr. White's books include a good sized serving of psychological information, analyzing the patient/doctor relationship, a rapidly changing plot and a very readable story that has roots in a real-life tragedy.  <br /> <br />If this is your first Alan Gregory mystery you are in for a treat with a dozen more to come.

It is written as an Official Study Guide for the exam. It talks about the test in a general sense, i.e. 12% of the exam is on Regulations and Standards. As an exam guide there are study guides, practice questions, and all the rest you would expect.  <br /> <br />The final surprising thing about this book is that it is very well written.

This is a book on the lessor heros, the little people, the women, even children that are also heros, even if of a lessor scale. Written in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack where we learned that the ordinary firemen, policeman, yes, even office worker occassionally does heroic things.  <br /> <br />This book, though is based on the characters in The Lord of the Rings. It concentrates on finding heroic behavior in the lessor characters to illustrate both the genius of Tolkien's work, how well it was adapted to the movies and to illustrate how these minor heros have simularities with's today's real-life heros.  <br /> <br />This book helps to understand how the adapted the book to the new medium of film, but also to show the depth of the original work and how faithfully this was carried out in the transposition to film.	2005-04-13

Perhaps more accurately, it is a book on computer programming but written with the vocabulary and direction necessary to have the computer programs automatically select and evaluate investment opportunities.  <br /> <br />The particular programming techniques described here use the Microsoft .NET environment, so the examples are very Microsoft centric.

The strange thing to me is that an expert on this subject might have some training in things like biology. But the jacket of the book says that Dr. Dembski's degrees are in mathematics, philosophy, statistics, theology and psychology.  <br /> <br />I think that this book is one of those that will convince the people who already believe it, and be rejected by the people who don't.

Another fundamental shift is the moving of wars away from the major powers to the developing world.  <br /> <br />The conclusions reached by a wide selection of researchers and professors of international relations, military theory are mixed. It rather depends on how you intrepret On War, not the easiest book to read. But in any case this book provides some profound thinking on the nature of war at the beginning of the new century.

Business One is their package that's oriented to small to medium sized businesses. They say businesses from 2 to 250 people. But I'm not so sure that I agree with the low end of this estimate. This is a pretty healthy package (with the corresponding price tag) for so small a company.  <br /> <br />Buying a book like this on each of the software packages you are considering purchasing makes good sense. Here you can get a feeling of just how well suited the software is to the way you want to do business.  <br /> <br />This book completely describes the Business One software package from the basic concept to modifying it via their SDK. It can be used as an evaluation guide (to see if Business One is for you) or an an implementation guide. It would be very useful to have read this beforehand. It's concise and to the point.	2005-04-07

(Dortmunder Novels)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Classic Westlake, Be Prepared to Laugh	You have to wonder how John Dortmunder manages to get through life without stepping in front of a truck or something else. On the other hand we have to be glad that he hasn't (so far at least) because it's nice to see someone whose life is more screwed up than ours. It's probably also a good thing that he's a crook. If he were just the standard hourly worker or whatever it is that would suit his mental capabilities, reading wouldn't be nearly as much fun. We can only hope that the real crooks out there are in the same class.  <br /> <br />In this, the 12th Dortmunder novel, he's collected the usual misfits to go out after an art collection. Then it turns out that their favorite watering hole, where they plan their capers has mob trouble.   <br /> <br />So the task is simple, rob the art while throwing the mob out of the bar. I'll leave it to you to find out how they do this, well, how they plan to go about doing it, well, never mind, just be prepared to laugh a lot.	2005-04-07

One of them German East Africa bordered Lake Tanganyika. On the Lake the Germans had established a Navy -- three ships.   <br /> <br />Ships,\\" well, the Kingami was 55 feet long. But it had already raided Bismarckburg and captured four machine-guns and ninety miles of telegraph wire. [This is hardly like what was going on in France at the time.]   <br /> <br />Out to get them was the British Royal Navy - using a flotilla (of two) forty-foot gunboats, The HMS Mimi [French for Miaow (as in cat)] and the Toutou [Bow-wow]. Each was armed with two machine guns and a 3 Pounder (37 mm) cannon.   <br /> <br />The intrepid crew - well Lt. Commander Spicer wasn't the oldest Lt. Commander in the Navy without reason, and the rest of the crew were shall we say consistent. There was fifty-something Sub-Lieutenant Tyrer, addicted to Worcester sauce as an aperitif. There was Chief Engineer Lieutenant Cross who knew almost nothing about engines.   <br /> <br />This book reads better than most novels, and it's true.	2005-04-07

Note the words vendor-independent. The modern company may well find itself with a NetWare network in accounting, Apples in marketing, Unix/Linux on the servers, and of course PC's. Not too many books cover all of these together. That's both together in the book and together in the network.  <br /> <br />Second, this book is also styled as a study guide to the CompTIA Network+ 2005 certification exam. It has sample questions and a general approach that is consistent with the CompTIA philosophy.  <br /> <br />Tamara Dean has worked in networking for over 14 years in a wide variety of companies and organizations. She has implemented the kinds of systems that she is writing about here. She is also a skilled writer, having written books several networking guides before. This has given her an understanding of what the reader needs and she has included this understanding in this book.	2005-04-07

World War I was a time of machine guns, air planes, tanks, and the big battleships at Jutland, not of three masted men of war.  <br /> <br />But the Seeadler (Sea Eagle in English) was just that, a three masted sailing ship that sailed for Germany in 1916/1917 attacking and sinking eighteen Allied ships ships. Amazingly they did this with the killing of only one Allied seaman.  <br /> <br />It's also surprising that some of the ships they sank were armed steamers with steel hulls. As one reviewer quoted on the flyleaf of the book says, this book \\"would make several films if audiences could believe it all really happened, which it did.\\"  <br /> <br />This is one of the more fascinating stories to come out of World War I.	2005-04-06

World War I showed us that making strong demands on the defeated (who didn't admit defeat to their own people) set the stage for the next big war.  <br /> <br />World War II was fought until the Unconditional Surrender of the Germans and Japanese. Something that thinkers still debate as having made them fight all that harder.  <br /> <br />VietNam was fought with no clear end in sight, and \\"another VietNam\\" entered our language.  <br /> <br />The first Gulf War was ended when Colin Powell and Bush II debated how to end the war. They stopped before they had to go in and see what the Sunni's, Shiite's and Kurds made of the power vacuum left by the removal of Saddam would have created. Bush II is learning about this now.  <br /> <br />This is the second revised edition of this book, originally published in 1971 and then updated in 1991 and now 2005 to reflect happenings in new wars.  <br /> <br />Still some of the old wars had interesting insights that I didn't know before, such as how Finland, originally on Germany's side against Russia, made a peace with Russia and kicked the Germans out before they became a Russian province. Great Book.	2005-04-06

It's a nominaly 128 pages of patterns. But what that doesn't say is that the patterns are broken down into parts. The top two thirds or so of the page is a picture and instructions for a basic bodice design. The bottom third is split separately so that it can be set to multiple sleeves, pockets, necks or whatever that fit with the bodice shown on the top of the page.  <br /> <br />As a result, there are sixty four or so basic designs (picture on left, instructions on right, each in four sizes from 21.5 to 40 inches in bust size) and to go with them are another sixty four (I guess you would call them) accessories. Although I'm not so sure that a sleeve is an accessory. Combining all of these options enable you to make over a thousand different sweaters.  <br /> <br />All of the patterns are set in the same gauge (22 stiches x 30 rows over 4 in.) and are calculated to produce this gauge using size 6 needles.	2005-04-06

We teach our young men (and our young women) how to fire a rifle, the basic weapon of all soldiers. This is important because without that knowledge disasters happen as they did at the Chosin Reservoir in Korea.  <br /> <br />At the same time we must also teach them when, why and at whom to fire a rifle (or not to). And to fire a rifle at another human is a difficult thing. It's a thing that we are taught not to do all of our civilian lives. The military spends a great deal of time thinking about this problem, because when it fails, as at the abusive prisons, Kent State, or Mei Lei the results are truly tragic.  <br /> <br />The author has written a call to arms to make the understanding of the profession of arms understood in our country.	2005-04-05

In its day the Star Spangled Banner was a \\"low class\\" drinking song, and they've been recorded by contrmporary artists. Likewise some of the songs recorded in Northern Ireland or Australia might well be considered country. I guess you don't have to be white and southern to be \\"country.\\"  <br /> <br />In this book there are a series of essays that deal with country music our country's early wars to the war on terror. In fourteen essays, the impact and actions of country music and its performers is analyzed.  <br /> <br />I think my favorite is the essay by Randy Rudder on the Dixie Chicks condemming President Bush on a stage in London. After Hollywood went berserk over Fahrenheit 911, why the commotion over the Dixie Chicks. DJ's were refusing to play their songs, there were CD Smashing parties, etc. Well, it's because they were country singers.  <br /> <br />If you're a country fan, or if you're a music theoritician, you'll love this book	2005-04-05

If you're a devoted fan of Michael Moore and his Hollywood crowd and believe that the Government is truly evil, capable of anything, and putting all kinds of nefarious conspiracy plans into action, then this is exactly the book for you (the author is an actor). If you believe the Government is a bunch of folk stumbling along as best they can, then you might want to ignore this book, or perhaps just ignore the big conspiracy and read it for the rest of the story which is pretty good in its own right.  <br /> <br />2. Surprisingly, the technical aspects of the book are also pretty good. I wouldn't put it quite up there with a Clancy, but the planes, bombs, and even the financial aspects are pretty detailed.  <br /> <br />The story itself has a post 9/11 plot, which begins with the first suicide bomber in the US. It goes on from there to more terrorism, interconnected in some pretty strange ways.  <br /> <br />There's also a pretty strange set of characters, especially the bad guys.  <br /> <br />Good story, highly recommended, if the anti-government aspects doesn't get to you.	2005-04-05

Some things like breathing we do all but automatically. We don't think about them at all. Some things like driving a car we do at least semi-automatically. We just go over to the right side of the road (unless we're British), we step on the gas to keep up with the traffic, but not run into the car ahead. Only when something unsual happens do we think about what we are doing.  <br /> <br />This book talks about the habits that are one step higher yet. These are the habits that make us go to work every day, determine how we spend (or save) money, make choices, and generally ignore dreams in favor of the comfortable.  <br /> <br />Mr. Tracy suggests ways that you can look at the habits you've aready acquired and compare them with the habits that successful people have developed. In addition to looking at your habits, he suggests ways to change them to those that might better meet your overall goals.	2005-04-04

It's a detailed account of the Colts season. Each game is described in detail with a couple of pages of summary and two or three pages of statistics. This is combined with a section of beautifully printed color photographs of Manning in action along with other information on Manning and the season.  <br /> <br />The focus of the book is, of course, on breaking the Dan Marino record of 1984, a record that was expected to never be broken.

He had an interesting task of making the project work with the Farm Bureau on one side of the battle, and the Sierra Club on the other. Then there are the well meaning tourists, and the poachers.  <br /> <br />In spite of it all, the reintroduction has prospered. the wolves have survived and in so doing changed the ecosystem of the park. In so doing, much more has been learned about the wolf behavior. The individual packs have been carefully studied, the pack dynamic, the survival of cubs in the wilderness, all have taught scientists more about wolf behavior.  <br /> <br />The stories are not uniformly plesant, the pack has survived, but not all members. There's the story, for instance, of a mother chasing an elk and running into a stick that pierced her chest and killed her. No one else would take over her pups and they died.  <br /> <br />This is a fascinating story of a decade of conservation.	2005-04-04

Most of these captured solders were treated with at least some respect and with some consideration of the rules set forth by the Geneva Convention.  <br /> <br />During this time however, some 350 soldiers were specially selected by the Nazi's as being Jewish, some by the \\"H\\" (Hebrew) on their dog tags, some just by looking Jewish to the Germans. These unfortunate captives were sent to a camp at Berga and forced to work at digging tunnels that were to hold a synthetic fuel factory. More than 70 of then died. Those that still lived have the appearance we've come to expect from the German camps, rail thin starvation.  <br /> <br />This is a little known incident in a horrific war. It is perhaps made worse because of the disappearance of Berga into the Eastern zone, the Cold War that followed. Maybe it was forgotten simply because it was too small. That is not to say that any life isn't important, but with perhaps 50 million killed....	2005-04-04

Dr. Puryear's concept is to present the thoughts of those who have held high leadership positions to see what they believe to be important.   <br /> <br />The list of admirals consulted for this book is too long to list here, but includes basically everyone you've ever heard of from World War II down to today. Some of the better known names include: King, Nimitz, Halsey, Burke, Turner, Crowe. Two of the more controversial leaders that are examined in depth are Zumwalt and Rickover.   <br /> <br />In between talking about Navy Admirals, Dr. Puryear sprinkles a bit of other tidbits from or about people like Benjamin Franklin, or Army generals such as Marshall, Eisenhower, and Bradley.   <br /> <br />I also found his discussion of Adm. Kimmel and Pearl Harbor to be quite interesting. In view of the continuing efforts on the part of Kimmel's descendents to exonerate him from any blame, Dr. Puryear takes a middle ground and presents a reasonable description of what happened.   <br /> <br />Highly Recommended.	2005-04-04

You went to the store and bought a TV set, where the only choices had to do with how big a tube and how fancy a cabinet. Not any more.  <br /> <br />This book is intended to make sense out of the techno-babble that the salesman is going to give you about modern day equipment. Even the words are changing. HDTV, aspect ratio, LCD and many such terms are thrown about by the salesmen, who may have only a slight hint as to what they mean but whom will try to make you look stupid by throwing them out.  <br /> <br />This book covers the current and soon to be technologies to tell you what is important and what is not when you are putting out your hard earned money. It covers the technology in a very general way, explaining what is possible, not the gritty details of how everything works. The book is generally speaking not brand specific. It talks about the general capabilities, not specific brands and models, most of which would be discontinued before you could find one.  <br /> <br />This is a very helpful little book.	2005-04-04

Kurt Cobain, a self admitted long time druggie had a blood morphine level of 1.52 mg/l. That's three times the accepted lethal dose. At the same time, there was a gunshot wound that was determined by the police to be the cause of death. The theory then was that he injected himself with drugs, picked up the shotgun and did himself in.  <br /> <br />From this comes a lot of conjecture, a lot of circumstantial evidence pointed in other directions. This includes a supposition that anyone with that much morphine in his blood couldn't pick up the gun. (Other experts say that after as long as he used drugs he had a tolerence that would have allowed it.)  <br /> <br />This is the kind of thing that creates a story. And it's a best selling story. There is somewhat of a conclusion that Courtney Love killed him. There are certainly those that think that. The conclusion is for you to read and of course the police and DA.	2005-04-04

In a full career John Boyd was not promoted above Colonel. This sounds an awful lot like Billy Mitchell who proved that battleships could be sunk by air power when the battleship people knew, absolutely knew, that they couldn't.  <br /> <br />Probably the most interesting part of this book is the story of the development of the F-16 \\"Lightweight\\" fighter. This fighter which has proven to be among the very best in the world, went through a torturous birth in two phases.  <br /> <br />First, while James Schlesinger was Secretary of Defense, the F-16 was a non-nuclear capable lightweight fighter. The second part is one week after his departure, the requirement was modified to require the ability to carry nuclear weapons. Other changes in Part II added over two tons of electronics to the basic airplane.  <br /> <br />The resulting plane, the author contends is a very good airplane, but \\"it is so much less than it might have been.\\"	2005-04-04

It is broken down into three major parts: Pre-implementation (Planning), Implementation, and Post-Implementation (Checking up with the end users).   <br /> <br />Within these areas there are chapters on the tools available to help you manage installations. This includes the Setup Tools, Windows Installer, and the lite version of InstallShield which will make your installation process look very professional indeed and with only a small amount of work.  <br /> <br />Obviously you aren't going to go to this much effort if you are just installing one copy in your own office.

Important stuff. <br /> <br />This is a guide to the current NASCAR season written by women, for women. It contains the usual information as to the racing teams, the drivers, the tracks, some history, some discussion on the season; all of the usual information that you'd expect in such a book. The difference is, as I said at the beginning, the emphasis is just slightly different.  <br /> <br />When you consider that some 44% of NASCAR fans are female, this equates to 2-3 million women watching the races each weekend.  <br /> <br />You might also want to visit the books web site: [...]	2005-04-03

It's the autobiographical story of Allison DuBois, the real-life medium who inspired the hit TV series Medium. <br /> <br />Ms. DuBois plainly says that she doesn't know how she encounters people who have passed over. The book is a story of some of the cases she has worked on and how it is to live a life where all of a sudden you have an ability that other people don't have, don't understand, don't even believe that you have.  <br /> <br />This also leads to some suggestions as to how you might handle a child with these abilities. This is not exactly a how-to book that most of us would need, but I can see that if you are faced with the problem, any help you can get would be great.  <br /> <br />Finally there is a very amusing chapter written by her husband on what it's like to be married to a medium. If nothing else, he's a very amusing writer.  <br /> <br />This is not a big book, this is not a spirituality text. It's the story of one woman's life. And that's enough for a small book.	2005-04-02

This is important because the tax laws of the US are so complex that it takes a specialized book (written in plain English) to cover a specialized area like this. For instance, changes in the tax law in 1999 made it easier to take the home office deduction and harder for the IRS to successfully object. BUT the IRS doesn't go out of its way to encourage landlords to take the deduction. Indeed you won't find a single word about it in any IRS publication or form. In this book there is a chapter on just this subject, and it includes such details that as defining when travel from your home office to your rental property is or is not deductible.  <br /> <br />This is the kind of detail that this book goes into. It is specific to landlords so eliminates all of the other material that is just in the way when you read it. It also includes access to a web site that updates this book with any changes in the law that affect the current edition of the book.  <br /> <br />Basically this tells you all that you need to know, and it is almost guaranteed to let you find deductions you would otherwise have missed.	2005-04-01

This includes: leases, rental agreements, managers, credit checks, security deposits, discrimination, invasion of privacy, the landlord's duty to maintain the premises, and much more, things you might not think about if you are just thinking about renting the house you're moving out of.  <br /> <br />Some interesting chapters include how to deal with those few tenants who will inevitably try to invent bogus reasons why they were legally entitled to withhold rent, another makes sure that you, your managers and any other employees know and follow antidiscrimination laws and, at least as important, make it clear that you are doing so.  <br /> <br />This book is now in its 11th edition. Any book that's been around for eleven editions must have something going for it. And one thing is access to a web site that keeps you up to date with any changes in the law since the book came out.  <br /> <br />Finally there's a CD-ROM with the book that includes most (quite likely all) the forms you'll need to be in the rental business.	2005-04-01

This book covers both the PMP examination and the basic knowledge in the PMBOK. It is much more clear than the PMBOK documents.  <br /> <br />2. This book presumes that it's been a while since you were in college and you may well have forgotten how to study, so it has some basic background \\"This is what you need to do\\" material.  <br /> <br />3. The book contains a sample test (60 Questions). It also has a CD-ROM with 400 additional questions. It also has a dedicated web site that provides additional material.  <br /> <br />4. It may be less expensive. I say may, because it's retail price is less, but it may be harder to find a discounted copy, that's because this is a newer/better book.  <br /> <br />All three authors have taken and passed the test.

The Natural Way means natural nutrition and a state-of-the-art exercise routine. It definitely does NOT mean steroids.  <br /> <br />Dr. Berardi is an expert in nutritional biochemistry. Mr. Mejia has a masters degree in Exercise Science. Both of these men are experts in their fields and they have combined their education and years of experience to produce this book.  <br /> <br />It is specifically aimed at the naturally skinny male who finds it as hard to gain weight as women find it difficult to lose weight. Mr. Mejia says that he knows your problem because he faced the same one in his earlier life.  <br /> <br />After failing at several attempts at building muscle, he met Dr. Berardi and they began developing a plan the combined nutrition with exercise in a logical and scientific manner to produce outstanding results. This book is the result of these years of experimenting and developing these natural techniques.	2005-03-31

It starts out with a \\"cheat sheet\\" that gives you a dozen or so web sites that have everything from vendor profiles (you will have to buy some equipment), to the standards and specifications.  <br /> <br />After that you get a plain English introduction to RFID. It's not everything you need to know, but it's enough that combined with the instructions for the specific equipment you purchase and the buidelines from your customer you'll be able to meet the customer demands.  <br /> <br />Don't worry, it's a lot easier than it sounds, you'll make it.	2005-03-31

Playing chess (very, very well) has proven possible, while driving a car or surviving in the wilderness is a long, long way from possible. Even the definition of these problems has proven impossible.  <br /> <br />This book first makes the assumption that unlimited computational resources are available, and then proceeds to develop a universal theory of decision making to derive a rational reinforcement learning agent.  <br /> <br />Even this approach is incomputable and impossible to implement. Chapter 7 presents a modified approach that will reduce the computational requirements, although they remain huge.  <br /> <br />Chapter 8 summarizes the assumptions, problems, limitations, performance of this approach, and concludes with some less technical remarks on various philosophical issues.  <br /> <br />This is a highly theoretical book that describes the state of the art in AI approaches. Each chapter concludes with a series of problems which vary from \\"Very Easy, solvable from the top of your head\\" to \\"If you can solve this you should publish it in the professional literature.\\"  <br /> <br />This is the state of the art as it exists today.	2005-03-31

His resume would fit right in with Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton and the others, but he was not president, he was not a signer of the Declaration of Independence. In fact, he did not initially favor independence from Britain. Yet, once the revolution was started, he was an ardent supporter of the new nation.  <br /> <br />In 1782 he, along with Adams and Franklin negeotiated the peace treaty with England. When he returned he found that he had been appointed Secretary of State. In 1789 Washington sent Congress a list of appointments to the new Supreme Court, with Jay as the first chief justice.  <br /> <br />As chief justice the Jay court established the court as a reasoned and honorable institution that carries forth many of the traditions that he established. After six years he retired from the court, and Washington immediately sent him to England to negeotiate a new treaty clarifying certain points of the 1782 treaty. While he was in England he was elected to be Governor of New York, where he served for two terms.  <br /> <br />Considering the quality of leadership he exhibited in New York, perhaps we should consider sending all politicians overseas somewhere while we hold elections.  <br /> <br />This is a splended book and well deserves a place alongside the recent spat of books we've had on our founding fathers.	2005-03-31

It gives me a kind of a funny feeling just to hold this book. I look at the pictures and read the descriptions of the various developmental models and then the production line machine. And all of a sudden I realize that not too many years ago this information would have been so secret that only the CIA (and other such agencies whose names I couldn't even guess) would have had them. Now, for only a few bucks, here is the complete story of this airplane from its first conceptual prototype to recently upgraded prototypes showing how it will be kept in service into the future.  <br /> <br />This plane was designed after American experiences in Viet Nam showed the Soviet planners that ground attack aircraft were still needed. It finished it's development just in time for the Soviets to use it in Afghanistan. It's still flying in the air forces of the now separate republics and of course in Russia itself. I find myself wondering if there wouldn't be a place in the US inventory for such a plane, but I then recognize that this is an old design, still useful, as is the US A-10 Warthog. Both of these planes are now 30 years old.  <br /> <br />Although a small book, this covers a plane little known in the United States.	2005-03-30

A lot of Lauren Bacall's friends have died in the last 27 years since she published her biography, By Myself. Here's a quote, \\"Less than two weeks after Greg's death (Gregory Peck), George Axelrod, another friend of fifty years, died.\\" Unfortunately there's a lot of death in this book.  <br /> <br />Lauren Bacall went to Hollywood young, became famous and through marriage and friends typically ran with an older crowd. (Gregory Peck was ten years older.)  <br /> <br />This book is sort of two books in one. As you might guess by the title, the first part is \\"By Myself,\\" seems to be a reprint of her original book of 1978. (I didn't read the first book so don't know if there are changes and updates or not.) The second part, 'and Then Some,\\" updates her life since.  <br /> <br />There have been movies, plays, successful books, but there's been a lot of alone. I can't say that that's bad, there are a lot of us who live alone, and by choice. But I'd have to say that this wasn't the best 27 years of her life. As she ends her book, \\"wit and a sense of humor and, thank God, I have hung on to mine.  <br /> <br />Keep going Ms. Bacall.	2005-03-30

By including good design practices from the beginning, the programming team can greatly reduce the effort required to produce the different variations of the game, in many cases using the same code to handle the different machines.  <br /> <br />The CD that comes with this book contains far more original material than most. It includes code for a memory manager, filesystem, and network driver developed using the principles shown in the book. In addition other code provides cross platform implementation of the major areas of game development.  <br /> <br />This is the only book I know of that handles cross platform development in a manner anywhere near so completely.	2005-03-30

This is NOT a book on using Photoshop to fix digital images to get what you want.  <br />2. This is NOT a book on the do everything automatically point and shoot digital cameras.  <br />3. This is NOT a feature comparison of all the different models of Digital SLRs.  <br /> <br />This book IS a book on the general features and capabilities of digital SLRs as opposed to the point and shoot cameras. And it IS on how to use these features and capabilities to their best advantage so you can get the best possible picture in the camera rather than in the computer.  <br /> <br />When I first looked at a \\"real\\" digital camera for the industrial pictures I was taking at the time, people were talking in terms of numbers starting at $5,000. And then there were the new lenses. I kept using film.  <br /> <br />Now the situation has changed. New camera bodies, some of which can still use older lenses (although not quite as automatically), have come out to completely change the picture.  <br /> <br />This book is very timely, and covers a subject that has been lacking.	2005-03-30

It was, in fact, the major task of the Union Navy during the war to button up the Confederacy. But with 4,000 miles of coast line from Virginia to Mexico, there had to be gaps in the blockade.  <br /> <br />Unable to face the Union Navy on anything like equal terms, the South turned to running the blockade using ships designed specially for the purpose. England, France and other countries did not declare themselves in favor of the South and did not send their ships to violate the Union's declared blockade. These countries were certainly willing to do business with the South, if the South could handle the last little bit of distance. As a result the Bahamas, Cuba and Mexico became staging areas where European ships brought in everything from weapons (like the Wentworth rifle used by a Confederate sniper at Spotsylvania Court House to kill Major General Sedgwick) to straight pins, and marine engines. They returned to Europe carrying bales of cotton.  <br /> <br />The South developed specialized fast, low profile ships to handle the other end of the cotton outbound, and manufactured items inbound.  <br /> <br />This book is the story of these blockade runners. Note that these do not include the Confederate raiders such as the CSS Alabama. The blockade runners were not armed, they were merchant ships carrying cargo back and forth in a desparate time.  <br /> <br />This book is the classic book on the subject, reprinted from the edition of 1958.	2005-03-29

It has a powerful set of wizzards, forms, reports and the like that almost make any additional programming totally unnecessary. None the less, Microsoft has developed a special variation of their Visual Basic for Applications programming language that runs on Access and which can greatly extend the capabilities you get with Access.  <br /> <br />The book starts off with a brief (33 page) introduction to Access including how to creat a table, define fields, and make a form. This is a quick introduction. If you know nothing about a database it's going to be a stretch to work your way through this chapter. If you're just a bit rusty on Access, this is a good quick introduction.  <br /> <br />Then in the second chapter he gets down to programming. I find this chapter a little backwards. The first thing he does is talk about \\"The Event-Driven Paradigm.\\" And he gives some code:  <br /> <br />Private Sub Form_Click()  <br /> 'write code in here to respond to the user clicking the form  <br />End Sub  <br /> <br />Wouldn't it be better to get the reader to writing some simple code, put in some code to be executed on a click and then explaining what he had just done. After this he just can't help from having to spend time describing the object model. Then he says, Don't worry about these details, we'll go into them later. After this, then the programming goes pretty well. I just didn't like this beginning. If you want to talk about objects which have properties, talk about them when you have them on the screen. Don't put in a few pages of stuff unreadable to the absolute beginner and then say don't worry about this stuff.  <br /> <br />I rank the book very high, because of the way it teaches programming. I just didn't care for the missionary zeal that object oriented programmers have to present their religion first. For the absolute beginner this is writing to impress rather than express.	2005-03-29

Active Directory design for your environment	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Uses 4 Hypothetical Companies to Illustrate Active Directory	One of the big changes brought about by the wide spread acceptance of Windows XP has been first the ability and then the willingness to use domains within networking systems. In this book John Savill uses several hypothetical companies to illustrate how Windows Server 2003 can use Active Directory features to establish and controll rather sophisticated networks.  <br /> <br />He starts with a Small Accountancy Firm that has been using NT 4 and Exchange 5.5 and describes how to upgrade them to a 2003 based solution. After that he looks at a medium sized firm, The Regional Legal Firm with three remote sites, multiple domains with differing levels of trust depending on the groups of users. Finally there's the big Retail-Based Company with 5,000 stores nationwide and an office in the UK. This company isusing the usual collection of equipment but now needs to be integrated together to provide the level of reporting and information flow that is needed. Finally there's the International Financial Company which just bought another company. Implementing the desired services in this company serves as a way to describe some of the more advanced features of the Active Directory.  <br /> <br />This book is positioned at an interesting level of describing the implementation of these systems where a network administrator could follow what is being done without going so heavily into the theory that he would get lost. It's intended to be a practical book, and handles this task very, very well.	2005-03-29

The Fed has been raising interest rates for some time now, although at a very slow rate. Investing for the future is really rather easy, you just have to guess right about the future of the market and your own life. <br />	2005-03-28

It's not a book on how to design, program  or play games.  <br /> <br />Instead it is a book that attempts to answer the question \\"what does it take to be asuccessful video game producer?\\"  <br /> <br />Here is a behind-the-scenes view of what it takes to succeed. It is about today's video game business. In the early days game production was usually a one man show. One man produced, designed, programmed, tested, sold, even designed the box. But not now. Now a major game project cost perhaps $15 million, this book is on what it takes to put together a $15 million development effort. It covers what needs to be done in all the areas, not how to do them, it's what needs to be done and how to put together a team that can do it.  <br /> <br />The author was Executive Producer at Relic Entertainment responsible for a major game, and now consults to some of the biggest players in the business. <br />	2005-03-28

This astounding book is her memories of a childhood from hell. Abandoned by her father, raised by a mother in an unloving home that deserves to be written about. Completely open, Ms. Moore makes you feel the pain of growing up that way.  <br /> <br />As the male equivalent, the Fat Guy, I understand. It was a lot like the life I lived at about the same time. But I think it was worse for a girl because our society places so much emphasis on beauty for females. But we still had a lot of the same thoughts, the same fears. I think it is a tribute to Ms. Moore's basic sanity that she was able to write such a deeply insightful book.  <br /> <br />The book closes: \\"I do not feel sorry for myself. I am what I am. I am glad I wrote this, and I am grateful - very grateful - that you kept me company while I did.\\"  <br /> <br />Thank you Judith Moore.	2005-03-28

Page 4 shows screen images of what we are going to program first, a simple take off on the KnockKnock game. -- Great. But then we have to take a detour as he wanders off doing things like \\"Introducing the WSH Core Object Model.\\" This contains the usual introduction to OBJECTS that object missionaries seem to have to put in.<br /><br />For instance he says: \\"The Windows operating system can be viewed as a collection of objects. For example, a file is an object. So is a folder, disk drive, printer, or any other resource that is part of the computer. What the core object model does is expose these objects in a format that allows scripts to view, access, and manipulate them.\\" -- What BS! -- I have a printer. It's sitting right on top of the computer. I can view it by turning my head just a bit. Yes, I'm wearing glasses to help me view it, but how is the WSH Core Object Model going to help me view it?<br /><br />He then goes on to say that if this is confusing, don't worry about it, we'll talk about it later. I realize that OBJECTS are Mr. Ford's religion, but I want to get on with programming a little VBScript. He doesn't go on to doing this until page 15 and 16 where we write a little \\"Hello World\\" program.<br /><br />Then we go on to a bit of history. We don't get back to programming the KnockKnock game until page 28.<br /><br />When he gets to programming he does a great job of getting the program running. In fact his concept of starting with a dead simple program and then building on it is about the best I've seen. One of the hardest things about programming is getting the first program running. Here he does it easily, quickly, concisely -- just great. But what good did it do me to spend all those pages reading that \\"Microsoft first released VBScript in 1996 as a Web-based, client-side .... ?\\"<br /><br />Chapter 2 gets us to programming another neat little game that gets us into a bit of logic. Great! But first, you guessed it, before we get to programming there a bunch of pages on the Core Object Model. Does it really help the Absolute Beginner to read that WshUnnamed provides access to a set of unnamed command-line arguments or that RegDelete() deletes a registry key or value? Do you really want the Absolute Beginner to even be thinking about the registry? Finally he gets to programming, and then he does great once again.<br /><br />He gets to Chapter 3 and as best I can tell, he never mentions the Core Object Model for the rest of the book.<br /><br />Conclusion: Great approach to teaching programming to the absolute beginner quickly. Perhaps Mr. Ford, you could put the programming of Chapters 1 & 2 into a chapter by themselves, and then you could put in a new chapter:  \\"The Zen of Objects and Some History.\\"ased, client-side .... ?\\"  <br /> <br />Chapter 2 gets us to programming another neat little game that gets us into a bit of logic.

In reality, there weren't that many Tigers produced (most of the German tanks in Normandy were Mark IV's). But the size, strength, and overall awesomeness of the Tiger transcended the actuality.  <br /> <br />In this book the second on Tigers, Colonel Schneider must have found every photograph remaining of the Tigers. Both the regular Tiger I, and the King Tiger (which the Germans called Tiger II) are covered. I don't know just how many pictures are included in the book. Some pages, of course, don't have any, but most have two or three. These are not the pretty professionally made pictures, these are pictures taken in the field, probably by crewmen. <br /> <br />The book is broken down by the units that used the Tigers. In general the history of the unit, in so far of their Tigers, is given. For instance on 5 March 1943 the SS Panzer Regiment 1 lost a Tiger, leaving them with 9 on hand. They reached their maximum number of 25 Tigers on hand on the 15th of November. By April 1944 they had received 42 Tigers and lost 42 Tigers and had zero on hand. Regiment 2 received 31, lost 31.  <br /> <br />You can't imagine the details that is given here. Note that this is not technical detail, this is the story of these tanks in action.  <br /> <br />Colonel Schneider is currently the chief development officer for the next generation of German main battle tanks.	2005-03-27

It contains sixty-two 'gems' that is, articles on how to some particular aspect of game programming. Sophisticated game programming is probably the most complex programming there is. And this book goes into some pretty sophisticated programming details. It is written by a collection of the best in the business today.  <br /> <br />For instance:  <br /> <br />3.1 - Ten Fingers of Deaty: Algorithms for Combat Killing  <br />5.11 - Heat and Haze Post-Processing Effects  <br />7.2 - A Simple Real-Time Lip-Synching System  <br /> <br />There is no question that the main driving force for faster computers is to make for more realistic gaming. And the faster computers allow more sophisticated programming to be done to make the grass wave realistically.  <br /> <br />This is probably not a book you're going to sit down and read from cover to cover. You'll probably scan through and read the ones that are applicable to just what you need to do next. But then in a couple of weeks, in a couple of months....	2005-03-27

When EDA was first being developed in the 1970's the avaialble computers were small and weak. As a result techniques to utilize small data sets with pencil and paper were developed. These proved that the concept had value in certain situations where the investigator did not have a preconceived notion of what he was seeking.  <br /> <br />MATLAB is a high-level technical computing language and interactive environment for algorithm development, data visualization, data analysis, and numerical computation. Using MATLAB, you can solve technical computing problems faster than with traditional programming languages, such as C, C++, and Fortran.  <br /> <br />It's a natural then to tie EDA to MATLAB. With the interactive and visualiztion capabilities of MATLAB large amounts of data can be analyzed rapidly in many ways. This book ties the concept to the software. It has a good introduction to EDA, and then illustrates several applications where MATLAB provides the analysis of data to produce unexpected results.	2005-03-26

Each book has broken new ground as he continues to develop his theories of management. In this one he starts with a discussion where a senior manager at Wells Fargo bank said, after giving a speech, the message in a speech should come down to one thing that comes through clearly enough that the managers I talk to can pass it along through the layers of management so that it comes through to the lowest employee in the chain.  <br /> <br />Hence the title. What is the \\"One Thing You Need to Know?\\" Well, it's not that simple. He's broken the book down to:  <br /> <br />What's the One Thing You Need to Know About:  <br /> - Great Managing  <br /> - Great Leading  <br /> - Sustained Individual Success.  <br /> <br />I'm not going to give the answers here, because the answers are not so simple as to be explained in a few simple words. Further, each person, sooner or later has to develop his own answer to these questions.  <br /> <br />This is a book that will make you think about your life, your job, your future.	2005-03-26

Pinnacle's Studio 9 is a love it or hate it package. At $99 (retail price) it is very inexpensive for what you get. The problem, people report, has been getting it to work on their system -- I also hear that the newest release of the package is much, much better. It also seems to work better with Intel Pentium CPU's than with AMD and it also likes memory, say a gigabyte.  <br /> <br />But as for the book, this is one of the Visual Quickstart Guides. They're great. They use a format of having two columns on each page with the outside column being text and the inside being pictures. Each page is devoted to some small task and handles that task completely. You can start at the front of the book and go all the way through and you'll get a pretty good tutorial on the software. Or you can use the index to skip around and quickly get to the particular detail you are looking for.  <br /> <br />Jan Ozer is an excellent writer. He starts out with the statement \\"you have the manual for the software\\" and then goes on from there. This is not a manual of how to, this is a what and why kind of book that explains what it is that you are trying to do and then goes on to tell you how to do it. The manual tells you how to do a J-Cut and an L-Cut. This book tells you what they are.	2005-03-25

Conceptually GIS came about in the 1960 with the ideal of co-registered overlays of what's underground. One layer (or more likely three) covers water (clean, waste, storm), one set covers wiring (power, telephone, cable TV), other layers cover steam, subways, gas distribution, or whatever.  <br /> <br />The 1990's saw the more powerful systems being combined with more advanced GIS software that was significantly easier to use. Finally GIS has reached the point where its use in smaller towns, smaller systems is not only practical but almost mandatory.  <br /> <br />This book, as the title says, specializes in GIS for Water. It's written about water, for water oriented workers. It uses terminology that is familiar and concentrates on software that is specialized for water use.  <br /> <br />Dr. Shamsi is director of the GIS and Information Management Technology for Chester Engineers (Pittsburgh). Chester is a leading-edge engineering and scientific research firm that provides water, wastewater and environmental solutions to public and industrial clients worldwide.	2005-03-25

There's hardly a bigger problem to imagine the hero having to face than the very existence of the galaxy itself. But that's the problem that Owen Deathstalker has to face in this the conclusion to Simon Green's Deathstalker series. I make this the eighth book in the Deathstalker series. It promises to be the last. All the story lines are wrapped up in a tidy little bundle. There will be no more.  <br /> <br />But then again, Deathstalker Destiny was billed as the Fifth and Last Part of the Life and Times of Owen Deathstalker. I guess the public just wouldn't let Mr. Green end it so easily.  <br /> <br />As with all the series, this book is filled with swash buckling action, covers a bunch of territory (as well as a lot of time as Owen goes back a couple of hundred years), and you know that good has to triumph over evil.  <br /> <br />If you are new to the Deathstalker series, you're in for a real treat.	2005-03-25

Each of these subjects gets a chapter in the book that presents the major legacy developments, the current state-of-the-art implementation, and some discussion on the emerging network security technologies from all relevant fields.  <br /> <br />Following this introduction (about one third of the book) chapters on Enhanced Technologies, Integrated Technologies, Network and WLAN Architectures and vulnerabilities take up about another third.  <br /> <br />Finally appendicies cover NSA and SNAC Router Configuration, RSA Public-Key Cryptography, and other standards and definitions.  <br /> <br />This book is intended to be used as a textbook and a reference for network telecommunications students, network and IT staffs who have a need to better understand the basic theories, interrelationships and interworking of different security functionalities. It does not go into specific details of commercial equipment, that is covered in the users' manuals.	2005-03-25

It is seen as having frequent parallels in the business world.   <br /> <br />Any book that has been in print continuously for 500 years has to have something going for it. The Prince is a set of rules that Machiavelli would have the Prince follow. They have entered our culture as a set of sayings such as \\"it is better to be loved & feared, it is better to be feared then loved, it is dangerous to be held in contempt or hatred.\\"  <br /> <br />By today's standards his recommendations are pretty brutal, Saddam Hussein would have found them to be exactly what he followed. Our elected princes (or our princes in business) in the US can't be quite this rough. Perhaps if we use the word fire rather than kill when a new president comes into the Government or the Corporation.  <br /> <br />Machiavelli was a better writer and observer than he was a practicioner.

He appears to be an evangelist for the .NET, Web Services, XML and certainly the InfoPath approach. In this book he presents a complete introduction to InfoPath from describing what it is supposed to do, to using it's IDE to produce some intergrated solutions.  <br /> <br />The book is said to be of beginner to intermediate level. This means beginner only so far as InfoPath is concerned. The book presumes you have a good understanding of especially Office 2003, the .NET Framework, and Visual Studio.NET 2003. You also need some knowledge of the other packages listed at the beginning. Finally, this is a book designed for the applications developer, not the end user. Consequently some programming experience may not be an absolute requirement, but a little .ASP, SQL, HTML knowledge wouldn't hurt.  <br /> <br />This is the hands down best book on InfoPath for the developer that's been published so far.	2005-03-25

It may be that he also wanted to save something of the union rather than creating unending hatred on the part of the south.   <br /> <br />During the war the South had created several of what would now be called irregular forces. The varied from the Gray Ghost, John Mosby in Virginia to Fortest and Morgan in Kentucky/Tennessee, to a range of groups in Arkansas/Missouri that included William Quantrill, Frank and Jesse James, Cole Younger and others that were little more than bandits.   <br /> <br />The Union was able to defeat these units, but only at great cost in people, money, and equipment. Building a blockhouse to defend every railroad bridge is a major effort. (The Union blockhouses looked a great deal like the blockhouses used by the British to defeat the Boors in South Africa forty years later.)   <br /> <br />This book brings this new story to the accumulated literature of the Civil War in an organized and complete manner that hasn't been done before.

It's a Confucianist take on waging and winning wars (and business). It is important to compare this Eastern view of warfare with the western view as defined in The Prince and many subsequent titles.<br /><br />The heart of Sun Tzu's thought is \\"All warfare is based on deception. Thus, when able to attack, we must seem unable. Hold out bait to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is quick to anger, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.\\"<br /><br />Any football play has all kinds of people running around trying to fake the opposing team to going where the ball isn't.<br /><br />Perhaps the best strategic use of the principles was Ronald Reagon's Star Wars proposal. No one knew if it would work. But if it had, there was no way the Soviet Union could possibly have countered it. They didn't have the computer systems, and because of their closed society they didn't have the young kid genius programmers that we've developed in this country. Although there was an awful lot of complaining about Star Wars in the academic community in this country, it ended the cold war without a shot being fired.	2005-03-25

Mr. Schank uses stories as a teaching aid. Stories move material from the what he wants to tell the student, to the this is \\"interesting or potentially useful\\" column in the student mind. Motivated students learn.  <br /> <br />The next strongest point is that people learn mostly by doing. Some things are hard to train by doing. How do you train Art History by doing? Well, how about you give the class some pictures, with the instruction that some of them are old masters and some are forgeries. The class assignment is to determine which is which. Now the students have to really examine the pictures. They have to learn techniques, they have to DO!.  <br /> <br />Finally he gets to eLearning and to a discussion on what high school and the rest of our educational system teaches.

Murder is the leading cause of death for pregnant women, and usually the killer is the father of her child.  <br /> <br />Why, here is to me, two questions. Why would the father kill the mother and his child? But also why is the public so interested, why did this one story get headline attention in newspapers and newscasts all around the country?  <br /> <br />Ms. Crier answers the first question pretty well. She is convinced that Scott Peterson suffers from a scoiopathic personality disorder. The symptoms he was showing, after her disappearance are classic. There's not enough time to discuss the sociopath here, if you want to know more about this disorder, there are books in the library, particularly the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the Mental Illnesses and Personality Disorders that will cover it completely.  <br /> <br />That leaves the second question. What attracted the country's attention to this one case, this one case out of thousands? I don't know. Ms. Crier says that she gives the pat response that it was a slow news day that Christmas Even when Laci vanished.  <br /> <br />But back to the book. The sub-title is \\"The untold story of the Scott Peterson investigation.\\" Perhaps a better one would be \\"The Complete story ....\\" Yes, there are tidbits of information here that is not recorded in other places, but most important is that here is everything in one volume. It's written by a professional journalist who has been a judge so can bring a level of knowledge and experience to the book that is often lacking.  <br /> <br />Here, in a few hundred pages, is the complete story presented in a clear and concise manner.	2005-03-24

They did things that I wouldn't have imagined possible if I didn't see the before and afters.  <br /> <br />The most striking to me is the image of a girl jumping in the air. They didn't like the angle formed between her legs and torso so they cut the image through her tummy and then gave her a new tummy.  <br /> <br />Then too ws the rather stock photograph of a church, green lawn, flower beds. The result was an image for a horror film: dark ominous clouds, rain, decayed crypts, damaged roof.  <br /> <br />This is no beginners book, unless it's to show the level to which you can aspire.	2005-03-23

This is not a textbook on .NET  <br /> <br />This book is, instead, a narrative trip through developing a software project using the techniques of eXtreme Programming, writing in the C# langauage, in an effort to learn the .NET environment.  <br /> <br />Ron Jeffries has been a leading advocate of (if not the founder of) the eXtreme Programming concept. Rather than talk more about eXtreme Programming itself (he has several books on eXtreme Programming listed on Amazon) he is using a new format in this book to get away from the heavy tutorial/lecture approach used in the other books.  <br /> <br />He, pair programming with Chet Hendrickson some of the time, first goes out and buys some C# text books. The first step is to learn a bit about C# so he starts working on some of the examples -- I was glad to see that the first attempts (like most of my own) didn't work, and he got a not very helpful diagnostic -- this sounds like my learning a new language. Then as he says, \\"I fumbled around in Visual Studio a fair amount.\\" Yup, I understand. A few dozen pages later, \\"Well, it almost worked, but it didn't.\\" Been there, done that. Another few dozen pages, \\"Found a bug, Write a Test. But we don't know how to test that particular bug.\\"  <br /> <br />I suspect from this you get the idea about this book. It's got a friendly, chatty, open writing style and along the way passes along some pretty deep messages about the subjects of XP, C# and XP. I like the style, it may or may not be your cup of tea.	2005-03-23

By early 1917 the BEF had developed a new tactical system based on fire and movement much like that of the stormtroopers, and which was to continue to be the basis for infantry assaults until today.  <br /> <br />This book brings together a series of articles by a range of writers to analyze what the British did during the war. It shines a whole new light on British leadership.	2005-03-23

But her life is shattered when a policeman knocks on the door and ....  <br /> <br />Delia is an ordinary person, not a superman in any sense. When her life is turned over she has to pick up the pieces and make her begin to question every aspect of her life.  <br /> <br />The book is written from various viewpoints so that the truth indeed becomes the truth as seen in the eye of the beholder.

In North America both the British and the French developed allies among the indian tribes.  <br /> <br />In 1757 the French had taken the British Fort William Henry and massacred the soldiers that had surrendered.  <br /> <br />Two years later Major Robert Rogers led a revenge raid against the indians some 200 wilderness miles behind the lines. His raid was a success, but getting back was not as easy as getting to the indian village.  <br /> <br />Pursued by the remaining indians with their French allies the surviving Rogers Rangers ran out of supplies and in the midst of winter had to fight their way back. ==Heros to the Americans and throughout the British Empire, Rogers was called the White Devil by the indians.  <br /> <br />This book tells the story of this little known episode from a little known war two hundred and fifty years ago. <br />	2005-03-23

The opening words say you should have, \\"Firm Programming Experience in C, including pointers, dynamically allocated data structures, and pointers to functions, C macros and the C preprocessor, fundamental understanding of Unix: processes, libraries, search paths, and so on.\\"  <br /> <br />Then the first chapter is on GLIB, a description of the more popular of the routines included in the library. The second chapter, GOBJECT has an opening note: \\"This chapter is dry and dense.\\" -- Still, this chapter is one of the best descriptions of object oriented programming that I've ever read.  <br /> <br />Finally in chapter 3 you begin to get into the heart of the matter. GTK+ is the toolkit for programming the GUI. Chapter 4 is on the GNOME Libraries. These two chapters are really the heart of the book and runs for about forty percent of the entire book. After that there is just some odds and ends that are left over.  <br /> <br />This book, as clearly and succinctly as possible does what it sets out to do. It's not the simplest book on the shelf, but then again, neither is its subject.	2005-03-23

Tommy Franks was the general in charge of Central Command who put together the military operations in Afghanistan and then in Iraq. In a shorter time than anyone expected the military was successfull.  <br /> <br />The reconstruction efforts after the war were ignored by the administration and by Congress. We'll have to wait for the next set of books to come out before we understand this part of the war.  <br /> <br />Tommy Franks spent most of his life in the army.

But it is very visually oriented. You browse to a site and read what you find. Alternatively you can download a filek, but this file is dependent on what the originator thinks you need.  <br /> <br />XML is of course the answer. XML allows the sender and receiver of information to use the existing packet switching web communication channels and the existing servers to handle the transmission of data between machines.  <br /> <br />XML is the core structure of a group of messaging commands. This combines with the SOAP protocol to define how messages are to be formatted using XML formats. Combining XML with SOAP and other standards results in the general concept of Web Services.  <br /> <br />This book discusses the complete set of standards that make up web services. It is a reference format book, not a tutorial. It is, as the title says, on the architecture and specifications. <br />	2005-03-23

The hero of the story is Granville Sharp, a Government clerk who educated himself in the law and used his own small income to bring cases on slavery to the bench.  <br /> <br />The second point that I find interesting is the fact that this was done in court. Parliment could have ended slavery at any time, but didn't. This is saying that even 250 years ago the elected officials didn't want to tackle the difficult issues but passed it over to the courts to take the heat. This rings a familar tone with the way the Congress left it to the courts to handle the segregation issues in the United States. (And today they passed the buck to the courts regarding keeping the feeding tube in the lady in Florida.)  <br /> <br />Third, this case took place in 1772, long before the American declaration of independence in 1776. It specifically restricted it's enforcement to England proper, not their colonies -- \\"Colonial slavery, he wrote, was a different matter.\\" Had those words been different, slavery would have been outlawed in the United States as well. What a difference that might have made in the American Revolutionary War? Might it have eliminated the Civil War where 600,000 Americans were killed?  <br /> <br />Beyond these issues, the book itself is well researched, written in a manner as interesting as a novel.	2005-03-23

Well, really it's a small network in a home that I use for business. I don't know if that's a home or business network. But anyway, I have one.  <br /> <br />It's working at the moment.  <br /> <br />The reason it's working is because I bought this book. The data comes in on a DSL line into a D-Link router. I usually write things like IP address, login name, password, etc. on a slip of paper and tape it to the bottom of the device. I have a good memory, but short, and this helps.  <br /> <br />No login name oe password on the router. I picked up this book, and on page 28 there the annoyance -- Getting to the router. Here she gives the IP address of the router (and those of Belkin, Linksys, and Netgear) as well as the default user names and passwords.  <br /> <br />Fixing just one problem like this makes this book well worth while. And reading the rest of the book (fast to read because you only look at the annoyance and skip the answer if it doesn't apply to your problem of the moment) gave me several better understandings of some of the problems that I've faced before.  <br /> <br />This is a beginning to intermediate level book on home networking.

But by 1943 the situation was changing. The production lines in the United States were beginning to turn out new and advanced planes like the P-47, B-17 and B-24 in quantities that our enemies could only imagine.  <br /> <br />In 1943, MacArthur was ready to begin the long road back to the Philippines and from there to Japan itself. MacArthur was fortunate to have General George C. Kenney to command his air force. The road back started in New Guinea, the first set of islands north of Australia. Here in 1943 the 5th American Air Force went to war against the 4th Army Air Force of Japan. Here the 5th American Air Force demolished the 4th Japanese Army Air Force. And here the 5th American Air Force developed the specialized modifications and tactics that they used until the end of the war when a 5th Air Force P-38 was the first American airplane to land in Japan.  <br /> <br />This is supurbly researched book, drawing on every available bit of information from unpublished Japanese documents, interrogations of prisoners, and decoded Japanese radio traffic and similar information including official reports from the American side.	2005-03-22

It seems like a lot of people in the time between the world wars lived life that was bigger than life.  <br /> <br />Walter Hagen, like his friend Babe Ruth, seemed to live life the way he wanted. As he said, he didn't want to be rich, he just wanted to live that way. And it seems that he did. Hard parties, triumph on the golf course the next day. Travel was by limousine with a second one for his clothes.  <br /> <br />There was a darker side of course, two failed marriages, the death of his son by an accidental gunshot wound, and his own death from cancer - a legacy of 45 years of cigarette smoking.  <br /> <br />Mr. Clavin has done a supurb job of bringing this man and his life to us.	2005-03-22

And there seem to be so many books like this one on sunken ships that you have to kind of have to be surprised to see that there are any ships still afloat.  <br /> <br />This book pretty much covers the world. It has sunken Roman ships in the Med. Spanish treasure ships bring back gold and silver from the Ne World. Ships from various wars seem to litter the ground in places like Scapa Flow. There is much more coverage of the Atlantic areas than of the Pacific.  <br /> <br />Mr. Fine clearly loves the ocean and its collenction of sunken ships. It is clear that he has carefully researched the ships he is writing about. I found the book hard to put down.	2005-03-22

It's also clearly the language of the moment. I really like the quotation from T. Rentsch given in the book: \\"My guess is that object-oriented programmine will be in the 1980's what structured programming was in the 1970's. Everyone will be in favor of it. Every manufacturer will promote his products as supporting it. Every manager will pay lip service to it. Every programmer will practice it (differently). And no one will know just what it is.\\"  <br /> <br />Dr. West is clearly a supporter of not only object orientation, but of XP and Agile as the natural consequence of OO. This book is more of a philosophical treatise trying to get people to think \\"objectly.\\" It's not a programming book.  <br /> <br />I read the book. I even enjoyed it. I learned more about object orientation than I knew before. But I look at some Java code that I write and compare it with that from recent college graduates who began to think in object terms from the beginning, and my code is still rather procedural, no, make that very procedural. After all, I started programming in assembly language and FORTRAN while the college kids parents were busy being born.  <br /> <br />What will kill object orientation is not us old procedural types, but the new concepts in languages currently being researched at the universities and places like Sun. Then the OO people will move to where we procedural people are now. But remember with the Y2K problem created such a concern about the old COBOL programs. COBOL and SQL and even FORTRAN are still with us.	2005-03-22

The person who can handle the programming complexity of doing a graphics engine is often not the person who is capable of designing the characters, scenery, and equipment needed for the rest of the game. In this area, the digital artist comes into his/her own. Note this says digital artist. This requires two separate skills, one is the ability to create vizualize what art is needed, the other is to use a computer rather than some other media to generate the desired image.  <br /> <br />The game design business represents an opportunity for the digital artist to obtain jobs with real companies that are relatively well paying. This book gives an artist's perspective into the game industry. It talks about the industry, the work, and gives insight on how to get a job. But mostly it talks about what kind of art is needed for gaming. It shows the detail that is necessary to produce a visually pleasing game. <br /> <br />The CD included with the book includes numerous illustrations and files from Maya and ds max. It also includes a trial version of Rt/Shader software. The book presumes that you have a workingknowledge of at least one major 3D program (3ds max or Maya) and Photoshop.  <br /> <br />This is a splendid book that is positioned to take an aspiring digital artist and carry him to the next level -- employment doing a job well beyond flipping burgers.	2005-03-22

Jane's Fighting Ships is now in its 107th edition. The Naval Institute's Guide to Combat Fleets has been published every couple of years since 1977. In any case that's enough for both of them to have become established and to have developed a solid background/format/procedure for gathering the information about ships and for publishing it in as accurate a maner as possible. They are both excellent works. Neither is perfect, because some information is difficult to get (The Naval Institute book says: \\"Data for North Korea are only marginally reliable.\\"), and there is a time lag between freezing the writing and the delivery of the finished product. ==So what is left to compare. They are both huge books, 7+ pounds of paper. The Naval Institute book has about 150 more pages than Janes, and it is about one third the price. Yes, one third of the price, not one third less. ==This book has 1104 pages, 4450 photographs. I also find it easier to read, easier to find what I need to know.	2005-03-22

And I have to admit that I've never read it. When the operating system is doing funny things, this is the book I reach for. The index is good enough that I can usually find what I need to know with only a couple of trys. And when I get to the area I want, the writing is clear enough that I can fix whatever it is that's giving trouble at the moment.  <br /> <br />I don't know if it covers everything there is to know about XP, but I don't care. It has so far told me anything that I wanted to know.  <br /> <br />I'm going to quit writing this review now. Someone just brought me a company notebook that was used by an ex-employee who left no record of the password. The book has an entry in the index - Passwords, Recovering From Lost. What more can you possibly ask of a book.	2005-03-21

One of the mail reasons, he said, was that the Catholic Church essentially had three layers in its chain of command: priest, bishop, pope.  <br /> <br />At the time I was working for a computer company as an engineer and had eleven layers in the chain of command just to get out ot the plant I was in, and who knos how many more to get to the president. This one of those computer companies that completely missed the PC revolution and is now still alive but pretty sickly.  <br /> <br />What attracted me to this book was reading a page where Mr. Bakke said that the corporation he founded had a three layer chain of command. I then went on to read of his concept of management of a company. He believes in empowering the worker to a greater extent than anyone I've read before.  <br /> <br />In this book he presents a workplace vision that he apparently carried out in the formation of a quite large company. I am left with the feeling, however, that the company became a reflection of Mr. Bakke rather than the principles that he describes in the book. As I look at the AES web site now, I see words like \\"Focus on Performance\\" and little mention of Mr. Bakke, apparently he is not even a director. Certainly the structure of the company as he founded it would make it a joy to work there. I wonder if it still is.  <br /> <br />This book is very interesting to read. It's more attuned to the individual starting or running a company than to the person working eleven or fifteen layers down.	2005-03-21

In the Revolutionary War it was John Paul Jones. In World War II it was Nimitz. During the period around the War of 1812 (which also included combat with the Barbary pirates, it was Stephen Decatur. This is his story, well written, and able to place Decatur in the story of the United States of the time.  <br /> <br />Decatur entered the navy in 1799 (well after the Revolutionary War) and served until he was killed in a duel in 1820. This was a duel that appears to be even more stupid than most. And the author goes to some effort to describe the failings of their seconds who probably could have prevented the duel from happening.  <br /> <br />During his brief career, Decatur rose rapidly in the ranks and with a combination of skill and luck was able to do the right thing, in the right place, at the right time. His promotion was fast, and he was the most famous officer of his day. His is quite a story.	2005-03-21

One is that biodiesel, that is diesel produced all or in part from vegtable oils is a practical fuel, or at least an extension to fuel. The other part is an evangelical sermon saying that the Government should support biofuels better.  <br /> <br />I agree with him on the first point. He says that bio fuels will never completely replace petro fuels. And in spite of the claims of some of the true believers, the US is not going to be able to produce enough fuel for it to continue using as much energy as it does now.  <br /> <br />On his second point of getting the Government to solve the problem, I don't think so. My experience is that the Government tends to screw up more than it fixes.  <br /> <br />Our Government responds to what they think the people want. And a poll published just the other day says that 73% of the people believe that the reason for high gasoline prices is price goughing by the big oil companies. The people completely ignore the fact that China and India have increased their imports by 30%.  <br /> <br />Today I read two things in the morning paper that give me hope for bio fuels. One was that the price of oil on the world market hit a new high. The second was that there are huge sales on SUV's particularily the bigger ones. I don't see the news shows putting these two points together, but that's another matter.  <br /> <br />Oil is going to continue to go up, not always, but the trend line is up. When people go to the gas station and petro fuel is $5 a gallon and bio-augmented fuels, either biodiesel or gasohol is $4.75 a gallon the problem will be solved.	2005-03-20

Victory sailed with 30 head of sheep, plus chickens, geese and ducks.  <br /> <br />What are slops --the collective name for clothing issued to seamen.  <br /> <br />There are 101 questions like these, along with their answers in this little book. In addition there are a series of photographs of Victory down through the years.

There are others (vi users especially) who swear at it, but that's another story. Emacs is a huge package and is growing bigger. Although you can consider it a text editor, it's a big, massive package that does a lot more than just edit text.  <br /> <br />At the start of the book the authors comment \\"Many people think that Emacs is an extremely difficult editor to learn. We don't see why.\\" I think the WHY is that most people start with a simpler more fundamental text editor like vi. Then when they think of moving to Emacs their fingers have to un-learn the vi commands to replace them with the Emacs commands. The authors say they don't recommend the vi emulation mode built into Emacs, but fingers sometimes take a long time to un-learn.  <br /> <br />If you've just decided to move to Linux, you might want to start with Emacs and never go the vi route. There is no question that Emacs has more power. Comparing to the Microsoft world, I think of vi like NotePad, while Emacs is like Word.  <br /> <br />There's an interesting table near the front of the book that asks you what you want to do with Emacs. If you want to write HTML, read Preface and Chapters 1-3 & 8. Then after you are getting some work out of the package, you can go to other chapters as you need them - Chapter 12, for instance to use Emacs to compare files.  <br /> <br />About half the book is on 'simple' text editing, where their 'simple' maybe isn't as 'simple' as the rest of us consider 'simple.' I do a lot of SQL, Chapter 9 talks about the editing support for SQL, and for other programming environments like Perl, Lisp, JDEE, etc.  <br /> <br />This book is from O'Reilly. O'Reilly does professional quality books for professional programmers. If it's time to learn Emacs, you can't do better than this.	2005-03-19

From the three laws listed in the Constitution we have now grown to over 4,000 Federal laws, and an uncountable number of regulations with the force of law.  <br /> <br />Today I was watching the news about smashing meth labs in somewhere like Iowa. A few years ago they found two labs. Last year they found fifteen hundred. It seems like the drug laws, the annual wars on drugs, the drug Czar, aren't really doing very much. I believe that one definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over when you know it isn't working.  <br /> <br />Then there's the so called Patriot's Act which to most people seem to directly violate the Constitution. (And to which challenges are making their way through the court system.)  <br /> <br />Reading about the apparent lapses in any kind of common sense described in this book is scary. You can only hope that they, whoever they are, aren't really out to get you.  <br /> <br />The prison population in the United States is 1 out of every 142 residents.

Of the 40,000 men who served in that branch, 28,000 were killed. Werner Hirschmann was one U-Boat officer that entered the German Navy in 1940 and served until 1945 when he and his boat surrendered to Canadian forces.<br /><br />This book covers several different subjects. The first few chapters deal with his joining the Navy and the training he received. Then it's to see on a destroyer, including excort duty for the Bismark when it left for the Atlantic raid. Finally he is transfered to U-Boats with more training followed by going to war. Finally came the sixth and last patrol, ending in surrender.<br /><br />There are two appendicies to the book. The first is a Pictorial Tour of the authors boat, the U-190 and the U-889, both type IXC long range boats. The type of submarines that were used in the patrols to North America, the Caribbean, the southern Atlantic, the Indian Ocean and the Orient. This pictorial tour is well illustrated. Mr. Hirschmann was the engineering officer on the boat, so as you would expect, these pictures feature most of the technical aspects of the boat. There is even a picture of the quite rare four rotor Navy Enigma machine.<br /><br />The second and somewhat smaller appendix is titled Life on a U-Boat. Again, it is fairly technical in nature.<br /><br />This is a splendid book, especially for the technically minded	2005-03-18

This is the report of the tenth investigation into what happened. There are too many revisionist historians who want to get their fifteen minutes of fame by writing a new book that will blame Roosevelt, Churchill, Marshall or whoever they pick on.  <br /> <br />This book is a report on the so called Dorn Report written under the direction of Edwin Dorn, then Undersecretary of Defense. Note he was not Navy Department or Department of the Army but above both in the Defense Department. He had no particular axe to grind. He was also young enough that he did not know personally any of the people involved.  <br /> <br />The conclusion of the report is that there was no conspiracy (in spite of how much we love conspiracies). Kimmel and Short were given warnings, not the detailed tactical information they both said later that they needed. But it was peacetime. These were officers who had prospered under peacetime rules. Kimmel, on the day before the attack said that he didn't believe an attack was possible. Short was a specialist in training, not fighting. He even had the air crew participating in infantry training to be able to stop the invasion of the beeches he expected.  <br /> <br />This report was instigated by the families of Short and especially of Kimmel. They would like these Kimmel and Short exonerated. In truth Kimmel and Short made the classic mistake of trying to determine the Japanese intent rather than their capabilities. Then they based their planning on what they believed this intent to be.  <br /> <br />Another recent book, also published by the Naval Institute Press, \\"Days of Lightning, Years of Scorn\\" by Charles R. Anderson is a fairly balanced biography of Short. Both are worth adding to your collection.	2005-03-18

This may be from timing, we can't visit Sherlock Holmes's London. Or it may be on the Orient Express, backstage at the opera, or as in this case Laos in 1975.  <br /> <br />The author, born in London living in Northern Thailand, has set this story in Laos where he once lived. The hero is a 72 year old doctor who has been appointed the state coroner. At 72 he has no experience at being a coroner, but at 72 he doesn't need to knuckle under to ignorant bureaucrats. The cases he has to solve are tricky and as unusual as you would expect.  <br /> <br />The cases, the people, the exotic setting and the humor (the Doctor joined the communists because he spied a female classmate in a tight sweater sitting in a cold draft who was an ardent party member.) have made this first novel a winner of several major prizes.	2005-03-18

If you are new to CCPM, you might consider it an extension to CPM where additional factors like resource and task logic constraints are also taken into account.  <br /> <br />The first four chapters of this book present an excellent overview of how it works. The first three chapters primarily discuss CPM and point out areas of potential trouble. The fourth chapter presents a complete single-project solution that compares CPM with CCPM and clearly illustrates the advantages.	2005-03-17

It is a collection of articles from the magazine Cryptologia. Cryptologia is a professional journal devoted to all aspects of cryptology. Down through the years they have published articles on Enigma written by the people who were there at the time and doing the code breaking, as well as by scholars who have specialized in either cryptology or the history of that aspect of World War II.  <br /> <br />This book is a collection of articles from the magazine. Some of them:  <br /> <br />- An Interview with Marian Rejewski, the lead Polish cryptologist who first broke the Enigma, built the Polish Bombe that allowed the British to read the Enigma trafic.  <br /> <br />- An article by William P. Bundy, the commander of the Americans at Bletchley during World War II, subsequently worked for the CIA and Department of Defense.  <br /> <br />- A bit over a hundred pages of the book reprint reviews of virtually every book published dealing with Enigma, codes, or intelligence during World War II.  <br /> <br />- There is also a little bit on Magic, the breaking of the Japanese codes, particularily in respect to the distribution of information to Roosevelt.  <br /> <br />- There are a few more tidbits about the American rotor encryption machine SIGABA - We are still waiting for the full story of this machine.  <br /> <br />- A discussion on what the history of World War II would have been without ULTRA or MAGIC  <br /> <br />The Enigma story is capsule in time. It was an electromechanical machine. In World War I the \\"electro\\" part wasn't developed well enough to enable it to have been built. Shortly after World War II the mechanical part was rendered obsolete by purely \\"electro\\" devices called computers. Using a modern PC to break Enigma would be a trivial exercise. And the encryption techniques used by modern programs like PGP would have been totally imposible to break with theequipment avaiable during World War II.  <br /> <br />As I said at the beginning, this is a fabulous book. It's not going to be a #1 best seller (in fact Amazon lists its sales rank as #283,536), it's expensive, and it probably won't be in print all that long. If this is your kind of thing, get it quickly.	2005-03-17

Following some sort of guidelines makes it easier to go back and look at old code that needs modifying or fixing. In this book the authors attempt to define a set of standards to be used in their company and suggest that these be the standards used worldwide.  <br /> <br />The book starts off very simply, i.e. where to save the files you are creating. By the end of the book in the security chapter the hints and tips get more complex.  <br /> <br />This is an intermediate level book. It is intended for the programmer who knows the language but is moving up to bigger projects. As with all of us, the authors have experience in various programming environments other than VB and C#. Sometimes these experiences come out in the form of a Practical Guideline that might not be the best way to do something. Your own experience will likewise lead you to programming methods that may differ from their Guidelines.  <br /> <br />On the whole, any programmer reading this book will come away with some guidelines of the \\"Gee, why didn't I think of that,\\" variety.	2005-03-16

The outside column has a headline explaining what the page is about and text to describe how to do it, and perhaps include a bit of explanation or a Tip. The inside column has a screen shot of what the monitor should look like as you do that particular operation. This is combined with an index that directs you to the page based on what you need to do.  <br /> <br />I find that this approach works very well for me. I also happen to like the writing style that Craig Hoeschen has. He seems to pick just the right level of detail that I want to start doing some function.  <br /> <br />This particular book is on Photoshop Elements, version 3. Version 3 has some nice extensions to the older versions of Elements, but if you've used Version 2 you probably don't need this book to pick up the differences. If you're new to Photoshop Elements, this is an excellent place to start.	2005-03-16

We see in people a reflection of ourselves, of our family, of the people we know. In the case of the Bronte's they were doing things that young ladies simply didn't do, like write books, and particularily they didn't write books like these. After all, the books that these ladies wrote talked about, dare I say it, yes, I will, sex. <br /> <br />This book, called a metabiography is an analysis of the biographies of the Bronte's. The first biography, written by Elizabeth Gaskell two years after Charlotte's death spun the sisters into picturesque myth -- family tragedies, Yorkshire moor, and all. All families have tragedies particularily in a time when so little was known about medicine. And the image you can write of the moor is different than the land really looks.  <br /> <br />In attempting to do away with the myth to get to the women underneath, this book takes an entirely new approach to the Bronte's and to biographies in general.	2005-03-16

It's positioned kind of halfway between the book on a programming language and the data book for the CPU. It contains a lot of information that the computer science classes don't bother to include. On the whole it is rather machine independent (hard to do in today's world where the Pentium class machines are so prevalent), so if you are working on a Power PC or an ARM chip the material here would still have value.  <br /> <br />Having said that, the majority of people in the computer business today would waste their time reading this book. Today's \\"computer professional\\" works in Excel or Access, perhaps doing just a bit of programming to create a macro, or a little VBA to do something special. That a Hex 41 represents an A is of no value to them. Indeed most wouldn't even know what Hex means.  <br /> <br />Those who want to go a deeper however, will find this book to be a great help. There are still a lot of programmers out there who are doing some kind of hardware driver to make a peripheral work with a system. Or they may be doing an embedded system of some kind, and here's the way to get started.  <br /> <br />There is one minor complaint. In the definition of great code, it seems clear that Mr. Hyde like tight fast running code. With today's processors running at gigahertz speeds with scads of memory, an argument can be made that the size of the code or the number of cycles it takes is almost insignificant. But if your job is to run something in real time....	2005-03-16

I guess that comes from the Godfather movies. Then this book said that the Most Wanted Gangster on the FBI's list was an old fashioned Irish American mob boss by the name of James Bulger.  <br /> <br />I had to check, but sure enough on the FBI web site ([...]) you can find the ten most wanted and there he is, just below Usama Bin Laden. Not only that, but there is a $1,000,000 reward for finding him (Bin Laden is worth $27,000,000).  <br /> <br />This is, as best I can determine the first book devoted to the Irish American gangsters that's been published. The most interesting, by far, of the people discussed in the book are the Kennedy family. Papa Joe was quite a character, a flagrant womanizer, who made his fortune by importing bootleg whiskey that he supplied to Al Capone. This also puts a different impression on Robert Kennedy's attempt to blame \\"the Mafia\\" - Italian based, as the source of organized crime in the U.S.  <br /> <br />This is quite a book, recommended to anyone who is interested in crime history, or even the political history of the Kennedys.	2005-03-16

There is a bit of confusion in that the author seems to relate God to the Christian vision of God. If you look at the Islamic, or other religions in world, they are not Christian, but certainly have a basic God somewhere in their religion. <br /> <br />This is a rarely explored area of philosophy that explores new concepts within the age old concepts of the Christian faith. It makes a fascinating read and opens new doors to some interesting areas of thought. <br />	2005-03-16

But as this book says, they're not rocket science difficult.  <br /> <br />Here in one book is a general introduction to the major business taxes that we all have to face. In addition there are comments based on experience such as: \\"Few people ever file form 5213 (Election to Postpone Determination that Activity is for Profit), and for good reason. It draws the IRS's attention and may invite an audit.\\" This kind of advice is hard to find in real life, but here the author has enough experience in the area to make such statements.  <br /> <br />Most of the book is on the standard kinds of accounting records you'll need to keep, the limits and philosophies that the IRS follows, etc.	2005-03-16

In this case, we all know the story. The code breakers had determined where Admiral Yamamoto was going to be at a particular time. It was just barely within range of the P-38's from the closest air base. American planes took off flying so as to minimize fuel consumption (Charles Lindberg did the experiments to teach them how to do this.).  <br /> <br />The American planes got to the location exactly on time, and Yamamoto was also punctual, unfortunately for him. Surprisingly there were two bombers there, and the Americans were able to shoot them both down. Yamamoto was killed.  <br /> <br />Then began the argument about who actually shot him down. There were four people in the flight that shot Yamamoto down. One of these did not return from the mission. Of the three that returned, each was convinced that he and he alone had gotten Yamamoto. But there were only two bombers, all three couldn't have shot one down. We still don't know who actually got him.  <br /> <br />This very well written book covers the history of the flight to get Yamamoto. By way of background it talks a lot about Yamamoto and covers the careers of the American pilots through the war. A lot of the background information will be familiar to the reader, but it is well done here.	2005-03-16

One important class of Japanese swords are the 8,100 swords produced on the grounds of the Yasukuni Shrine between 1933 and 1945. The group of swordsmiths collected there preserved the time-honored forging methods and the aesthetic and apiritual traditions of the samurai warrior.  <br /> <br />In the aftermath of World War II sword ownership was banned in Japan and many of these swords were destroyed. Others became war booty and were removed to the victors countries.  <br /> <br />After the manufacturing of swords was allowed in 1954 many of the smiths began making swords again, but independently.  <br /> <br />This book is both a collection of photographs of Yasukuni swords and a story of the swordsmiths and the institution. It is a book that speaks of these historic swords with reverence.	2005-03-16

Then just after 9/11, anthrax was sent to several offices around the United States. (The author is suspicious that this was a small attack, possibly conducted by a foreign intelligence agency, to measure the reaction of the US Government to the application of biological or toxin weapons.)  <br /> <br />In this book Alexander Kouzminev, a scientist at the Soviet Union's biological research unit of the KGB tells the story of what the Soviets have been doing in the areas of biological weapons. In this story, he not only talks about the work of their lab, but provides valuable insight into how such weapons work, how they can be distributed, and how frighteningly effective they can be.  <br /> <br />This is the first work I've seen that begins to life the veil of secrecy surrounding biological warfare. It's an important book.	2005-03-16

This book is a collection of about two hundred wedding pictures. Almost all of the images are by Rick Ferro, probably the leading wedding photographer in the country. The surprising thing is that in this collection of photographs, each one looks fresh and inviting. You would think that there would be a sameness about the images. After all, they are all pictures of the same thing, a wedding.  <br /> <br />The photographing of a wedding is broken down into five catagories: Before the Wedding, the Ceremony, the Bride and Groom, Group Shots, and Marketing and Selling. Even Rick Ferro has to market and sell himself. <br /> <br />This book is an idea book, not an explicit set of do this type instructions. And it is likely that no-one can read it without having at least one idea that he wants to try out.	2005-03-15

(Well, let's be more polite and say not dumb people, but people unfamiliar with this product.) And Microsoft has continued this tradition. FrontPage 2003 is much more closely integrated into the Microsoft Office environment that it was a few versions ago. There is now support for cascading style sheets, database connectivity (ASP and PHP), XML, and VBA programming.  <br /> <br />I kind of wonder though at the thought of a software package that needs a 792 page book to describe it as being for dummies. There's gotten to be an awful lot in FrontPage.  <br /> <br />This book is divided into nine books. These are organized in such a way that you don't need to read all of them to start using FrontPage in a productive way. For instance if you are doing static (not database) related pages, there are several book that you don't need to read, you can save them until you need that material.  <br /> <br />If you've made the decision to use FrontPage, here is the most complete reference book available.	2005-03-15

It's much harder to get an answer to a problem where the answer is that their is a 62% chance that the answer is yes. Unfortunately, in real life it's this second class of problems that predominates.  <br /> <br />This book is oriented to solving these kinds of real world problems. The exercises in the book are chosen from real world examples -- what we used to call story problems. This tends to give the student a better understanding of not only the mathematics and programming involved but experience in looking at problems with a view to understanding this approach to solving the problem.  <br /> <br />This book is suitable for a one or two semester introductory class at the upper undergraduate or beginning graduate level.  <br /> <br />Just a word about the illustration on the front of the book. At the end of the book Alice in Wonderland the queen is about to order Alice beheaded. Alice says, \\"You're nothing but a pack of cards.\\" At this, the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down around her. This illustration is by John Tenniel from the original book of 1899. A deck of flying playing cards is a good way to illustrate random and probability.	2005-03-15

If we think of it as just another form of entertainment show featuring a small team of bubble heads with puffed up hair and the ability to giggle at each other then it all makes sense.  <br /> <br />Last night a featured local story was that diesel fuel prices were higher here than a few hundred miles away so truckers were just buying enough fuel to get to where it was cheaper. So what.  <br /> <br />Every day or so we hear another American has been killed in Iraq. Every week or so a thousand Americans are killed in car crashes. Not a mention. Every month 10,000 or so people die from AIDS -- old news, no one cares.  <br /> <br />Tom Fenton's book is quite interesting from an international news point of view. It joins with a bunch of other books lamenting the dumbing down, spin controlled, if it bleeds, it leads attitude of the media. I wish I could say that I felt it would do some good.  <br /> <br />Have a good retirement Tom.	2005-03-15

This book is a collection of about two hundred wedding pictures from around the world. It shows how the best wedding photographers from around the world produce wedding albums that delight their customers, who in turn recommend them for other weddings.  <br /> <br />Beyond taking the picture, this book shows the result of using Photoshop to enhance the pictures.

And then when it was discovered that the writer had been hospitalized in a mental institution by her father, the presidential candidate, any possible credulence would disappear.  <br /> <br />But of course, what if it's true.  <br /> <br />Then again, what if it's not.  <br /> <br />If it exists, the conspiracy has killed before.

I have seen one advertising type after another decide that it's time to completely change the advertising image just because they considered the old message should be arbitrarily changed every so often.  <br /> <br />In 1915 a company went to a class making company and wanted a design that would be so distinctive that even if it were broken it would still be recognizeable. The result was the famous wasp waisted Coke bottle. Which, of course, the Coke company rarely uses any more. Do you remember the Coke bottle in the movie the Gods Must Be Crazy, what other bottle could they possibly have used?  <br /> <br />In this book Mr. Lindstrom goes well beyond these basics to discuss creating a brand image that would use every human sense to enhance the strength. Beyond sight and sound which you can use on television, he says that smell is the next strongest sense. Then he describes the scents that the automobile companies have developed to spray on the insides of their newcars.  <br /> <br />This book covers the basics of branding and goes a lot further. It should be required reading for lots of people. <br />	2005-03-15

Then the news was coming on and I decided to watch it. The big story was of Martha Stewart getting out of prison.  <br /> <br />Martha may have illegally traded to the extent that she saved $41,000 (I say 'may have' because she is appealing and the final verdict isn't in yet.). But the people talked about in this book basically defrauded the public out of millions or perhaps even billions of dollars and got away with fines that the author says were \\"little more than a rounding error given the company's huge earnings.\\"  <br /> <br />To be sure, a few people went to jail, but then again so did Martha.  <br /> <br />This book provides an insight into those recommendations your broker gives to you so freely. Except maybe they aren't really so free.	2005-03-15

Most of them say that you want to stay away from fixer uppers. They say that the time you spend fixing is time that you could better spend buying or selling.  <br /> <br />Jay DeCima takes another view. He says that he buys Ugly Ducklings and then fixes them up to make them desirable rentals. He says that most of the fixing up is low skilled labor that he can do himself cheaper than hiring it done. This would include things like clean up and painting. Other more specialized things like installing a new toilet may be something you don't know how to do. So hire a plumber, but watch what he does so you'll at least know how later. He does say, however, that he knows a lot of such investors who contract out the work.  <br /> <br />So called sweat equity is certainly a good way to get started.

Only many years later did she make contact with her 'natural' family.  <br /> <br />I wonder if it wouldn't have been better for her to have never met up with them.

One of these is the competition from Windows. This book is aimed at the network administrator in a Windows world. Any network administrator that isn't living in a dream world has to at least be aware of Linux. And he probably knows things like the increased stability, lower cost, faster performance of Linux.  <br /> <br />The problem is that very few administrators have the authority (or are willing to put up with the complaints) of changing the desktop machines. This book might be called the guerilla warfare approach to bringing Linux into the network. It says to define a background application such as file, web, or mail server to set up using Linux. Set up one Linux box to handle this task. The rest of the network remains Windows oriented. As you get more experience with Linux, pick another background application to convert.  <br /> <br />Alternatively you can bite a big bullet and change all the machines. Appendix B gives some hints and tips on things like what desktop software is available, how to run Windows programs under Linux, file system compatibility and so on. It doesn't tell you what to do when the boss's secretary comes screaming at you for changing her desktop.	2005-03-14

Spring (often used in conjunction with Hibernate) is among the newest and is gathering quite a bit of attention. Spring brings almost all of the capabilities of EJB to the world of Plain Old Java Beans.  <br /> <br />In this book Walls and Breidenbach have done a superb job of introducing Spring. Often computer books seem to leave out the first forty pages that describe just what it is that they are trying to explain.  <br /> <br />In this book Chapter 1 is just about forty pages and is a really excellent introduction. It is titled A Spring Jump Start, but before it jumps off it has sections like Why Spring? This section starts off with a description of the process of writing and testing a bit of code using EJB. It then goes into What is Spring? This section talks about Spring both as a concept and with some very brief code samples. Then there's Understanding Inversion of Control, perhaps the biggest thing that Spring brings with it. And after that is Applying aspect-oriented programming, the secong big Spring thing. After reading this chapter the reader should have a pretty good idea just what Spring can do for him.  <br /> <br />If you are still reading after Chapter 1, the remaining chapters give you all the rest of Spring's capabilities using an approach that's kind of tutorial related, kind of reference book oriented.  <br /> <br />Compared to most computer books, this one is easy to read (intermediate level, you will certainly need to know Java before you start this book), and has just enough humor mixed in to help keep you awake (after all, it's still a computer book).	2005-03-14

How can you not get it?	2005-03-14

Oh I wish I'd had this book when my daughter was tiny. (She's six feet tall now and engaged and won't let me read to her any more.)  <br /> <br />Let me just quote a few sentences: \\"Flower fairies love flowers so much that some of them find their way into our gardens. In fact, the more flowers you plant, the more likely it is that the fairies will find you. Their favorite is the tulip because in the spring, when their babies are born, they can lay them down inside the petals and rock them to sleep.\\"  <br /> <br />And then there is how the fairies invented parsley.  <br /> <br />And the selkie, who ... No, you need to read it.  <br /> <br />Perhaps my daughter will bring some grandkids into the family. Then I'd have an excuse.  <br /> <br />No, I don't need an excuse, tonight I'm going to put on a Harry Potter movie, and when it's over I'm going to bed and read this little book just to myself.	2005-03-12

Here are seventy-four pictures from several cities, fire-bombed with conventional munitions, not atomic bombs, that look just as devastated, just as destroyed.<br /><br />But more than that are pictures of the people. There's a picture of the crowd at an Athletic Day - women, children, and old men - the young men are gone, probably never to return. There's a picture of a young boy, perhaps eight years old. To his back is strapped his little brother, perhaps one year old. The little brother is dead and the boy is delivering him to the cremation site.<br /><br />Yes the pictures from other wars, the child at the railway station after the rape of Nanking, those from the camps in Germany are equally tragic. Even the pictures showing Charleston after Sherman's army went through show this kind of destruction.<br /><br />But there is a special feeling I get from these pictures. Perhaps it comes as a residual of the racial hatred this country felt towards Japan. I hope not, but the fact is that these striking photographs make me feel terrible.	2005-03-12

Gole	The profession of arms is a strange one. t simply asks that you be willing to go out and fight for your life with another man doing the same thing. And both of you are doing it for home, country and other nebulous things that are very hard to define.  In recent times the opinion of the public has not held soldiers in high regard. I remember the stories of Chelsea Clinton insulting soldiers in the White House.  <br /> <br />Henry Gole was a career Army officer. He served in Korea, VietNam and in lots of peacetime positions. Along the way he got a Ph.D. and retired as a Colonel. Why, he asks himself. It was the men with whom he served. A most enjoyable book, especially at this time while so much of the Army is in Iraq.  <br /> <br />I'm reminded of the Kipling poem 'Tommy:' <br /> <br />Then it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' \\"Tommy how's yer soul?\\" <br />But it's \\"Thin red line of 'eroes\\" when the drums begin to roll.  <br /> <br />Thank you Col.

Perhaps in cave man days where you married at 12 or 13, had grand kids at 25 or 30 and were dead at 40. But that's not the way it is any more. We live a lot longer. And we know that divorce will end more than half of the marriages. Studies say that almost all of the rest are not happy marriages, it's just that they choose not to separate for any of a number of reasons.  <br /> <br />As a male, this book is extremely interesting to read. It is almost like eavesdropping on a conversation between two women who wouldn't be saying these things if a male was around. It's certainly true that we don't think alike. And the studies say that the percentage of females having affairs is rapidly catching up with the male percentage. The reason seeems to be opportunity, nothing to do with desire which has always been there, just the opportunity as more women enter the workforce for them to meet men.  <br /> <br />This book presents an insight into the Venusian that we Martians don't often see.	2005-03-11

It said Ed McBain, it was a new title. I got it. I packed it in my briefcase to take on the plane the next day. On the plane I leaned back, got out the book and was looking forward to see what the crowd at the 87th was up to now. Imagine my surpise when I didn't get immediately transported to New York (the plane didn't go there either).  <br /> <br />Instead I went to Cape October, Florida (no the plane didn't go there either). At Cape October I met Alice Glendenning who was not having a good time in her life. Let's see, there's her husband, fallen off of his sailboat and presumed dead; there's the insurance company, not paying her husband's life insurance; there's her ankle, broken; there are her two kids, kidnapped -- and that's just up to page 20.  <br /> <br />So what can Alice do but go visit her artist friend Charlie. Then the cops show up, they're the Cape October cops, but they were trained at the Keystone Cops School of Ineptness. Then the FBI (kidnapping is a Federal offense) shows up. They were trained in fighting turf wars.  <br /> <br />My disappointment at not having a visit with the guys down at the 87th turned into a very pleasant Florida visit. I suggest you take a 290 page visit there yourself.	2005-03-11

It is too technical for the president or board of directors. It is too simplified for the systems analyst who will be implementing a system. For someone inbetween these positions, this is an excellent book.  <br /> <br />If you go try to learn about BizTalk at the Microsoft web site it sends you to page after page, written at the two extremes given  above. At the teckie level you can download the package and go into it as deeply as you wish. At the high level the discussion is so high that it is almost meaningless, an example: \\"In today's global economy, companies need to integrate applications, systems, and technologies from a variety of sources.\\" OK, so what?  <br /> <br />In this book the authors have presented the BizTalk system with the two specialized packages (Accelerators, whatever those are) that are aimed at the health care marketplace. There's a fairly clear description of what we are trying to do with this software, a bunch of diagrams showing what data goes where, and discussion of what you can do, with a minimal amount of how to do it.  <br /> <br />This is a small enough book that you can read it fairly quickly and come away with a fair understanding of the Microsoft philosophy of meeting the HIPAA and HL7 standards.	2005-03-11

It contains sixty-two 'gems' that is, articles on how to some particular aspect of game programming. Sophisticated game programming is probably the most complex programming there is. And this book goes into some pretty sophisticated programming details.  <br /> <br />For instance:  <br />4.2 Dynamic Grass Simulation - Just how does grass move when the wind is blowing  <br />5.7 Rendering Gemstones - you can see through them, you can see highlights  <br />5.2 Let it Snow - And how does the appearance of snow change if you are moving through it.  <br /> <br />There is no question that the main driving force for faster computers is to make for more realistic gaming. And the faster computers allow more sophisticated programming to be done to make the grass wave realistically.  <br /> <br />This is probably not a book you're going to sit down and read from cover to cover. You'll probably scan through and read the ones that are applicable to just what you need to do next. But then in a couple of weeks, in a couple of months....	2005-03-11

Here is one of them.  <br /> <br />We view Italy (and Germany for that matter) as countries, countries with a history going back for thousands of years. But this isn't true. These two countries came together as countries in the middle 1800's. Before that they were a loose collection of city states, small kingdoms I'd guess you call them.  <br /> <br />This is one such story. Victor Emmanuel II, the king of an Italy finally united wanted to make Rome/The Vatican a part of Italy. The pope, at that time Pius IX, didn't recognize Emmanuel or for that matter Italy. Thus began this story.  <br /> <br />The Pope retreated into the walls of the Vatican, and they remained at impasse until Mussolini finally came to an agreement that stands today where the church recognizes Italy, and Italy agreed that the Vatican was a soverign state.  <br /> <br />This is a fascinating and little known story based on recently opened archives.  <br /> <br />Now if the author could go back to the Vatican and get the archives on Galileo.	2005-03-10

But both of her parents had voted for Hitler in the 1933 elections. At three she was photographed sitting on Hitler's knee.  <br /> <br />Ms Hunt lived in Berchtesgaden, in the show of Hitler's Eagle Nest headquarters. For her, World War II made little impression until 1941 when her father was killed (Perhaps by drowning, perhaps by the French Resistance).  <br /> <br />After this, the presures of conforming at school, (this is a good lesson on how the Nazi's taught their view of reality to the kids) began to be mixed with sadness. She reports being called in to talk with her teacher who asked her about her Grandfathers opinions of Hitler and the Nazi's. She reported that she didn't know, that she didn't remember anything he had said at all on the subject.  <br /> <br />Suddenly the child had to start assuming adult responsibilities. And life got worse, much worse as Allied bombers began to visit.  <br /> <br />After the war Ms. Hunt has obviously spent a lot of time thinking about what it means to be German, what it means to be a German of that particular era. Fascinating insight into the thinking of a young girl.	2005-03-10

Pivot tables are an amazingly powerful tool that allows you to turn the data around (pivot even) and look at it from another point of view. It's also amazing that a high percentage of books on Excel simply ignore pivot tables altogether, or perhaps give them half a page. This book has an entire chapter on pivot tables. Furthermore, if you read the Microsoft help screens on pivot tables you get 113 topics to read. In this book the description of pivot tables explains what they are, shows you some examples to illustrate what can be done, and then leads you through using them. This is truly what the manual should have shown, if of course there was a manual that came with Excel.  <br /> <br />The next thing I look for is XML. This is really the big thing that makes Excel 2003 a new edition of Excel. Sure enough, a chapter on XML as well. (Except for this section and a few very minor points, you can use the manual for earlier versions of Excel.)  <br /> <br />But suppose you are not up to guru level and wanting to know about pivot tables and XML. Well, the book starts off with Creating a Basic Worksheet and goes on from there.  <br /> <br />In summary, here is everything you need to know about Excel from the very basic steps to just as far as you want to go.	2005-03-10

In reading it I was reminded of Lee Iacocca saying that Robert McNamara coming to Ford was the best thing that could have happened to Ford at that time, and that Robert McNamara's leaving Ford was the best thing that could have happened to Ford at that time.  <br /> <br />It appears that Eisner's dealings with Disney fall into similar terms. When Eisner came into Disney his talents were desparately needed. His achievements in the first ten years were fantastic, the stuff of which legends are made. Everything he touched from movies, cable television, to the movement of movies to Broadway turned into gold. In the last ten years the glitter seems to have gone from his touch. In the last ten years Disney's financial performance has been pretty bad. It also seems that the executive suite has had a revolving door. Senior management comes in, and in turn are replaced, often at great cost.  <br /> <br />This book analyses and describes the full twenty years of Eisner's rule, but spends more time on the down side.  <br /> <br />I was left with the feeling that success spoiled Eisner. Perhaps he needed the sense of desperation that the company had when he was hired.	2005-03-10

Each of these, however, can really mess up your day.  <br /> <br />Each of these however can be not solved but made much better with just a bit of advance planning. Losing your computer and/or crashing the disk drive is easy to fix if you have a backup, or if like Beethoven you remember everything in the manuscript you lost on the train.  <br /> <br />Most of this book, however, turns out to be software oriented. It's here that the bad guys can attack your system from afar with virtually no chance of getting caught. Perhaps they just want to screw up your life with a virus they created just for fun. Perhaps they want to send you a never ending stream of advertising, even customized based on keeping a record of what web sites you've visited. But perhaps they also want to capture your credit card number so that they can use it to buy a new computer (to be shipped somewhere in Africa).  <br /> <br />The first thing I look for on books like this is CoolWebSearch. If they talk about it, they know whereof they speak. And sure enough CoolWebSearch is discussed on page 231. The book says: \\"Removing ... can be an extremely complicated process. He'd absolutely right. When one of my companies machines gets one of these, sometimes all I can do is go back to the last system restore file, or even start over with a new version of the operating system.  <br /> <br />Invaluable help if you do just a little bit of work in advance.	2005-03-10

It was one of the first such packages and was usually used in conjunction with big powerful databases such as Oracle or SQL Server that didn't have sophisticated reporting structures built into the database.  <br /> <br />This book is oriented to guiding the reader through passing the CRCP exam. As such, it's orientation is less formal and descriptive and more oriented to the practical aspects of what's on the test. It includes a CD with a simulated set of examinations (you take three tests) to give you the look and feel of the test and help identify any areas where you need more knowledge.  <br /> <br />The design of the book is such that it will be useful in passing the test and still of value as a reference book to the Crystal Reports user.	2005-03-10

It also seems that at last the western publishers have been able to connect with Russian writers to actually get a lot of information public for the first time.  <br /> <br />This book is one in a series, it covers all of the various Soviet design bureaus. For some of the bureaus, information is scarce because they still consider the information secret. <br /> <br />The book is broken down into varous categories such as piston engined, early jet, ground attack, very high performance design studies, and so on. Many of the planes closely resemble the planes of the time being built in the free world. One looks very much like the American B-45 Tornado. Other planes explore entirely different configurations as their engineers experimented to find the best shape to meet the demands of the customer and to take advantage of the new technologies being developed.  <br /> <br />To the aviation buff, here is a set of aircraft you haven't seen before.	2005-03-10

It can be used by anyone all of a sudden in over his head in getting a network set up and running. The text is written very straight and to the point. A lot of books of this type spend a lot of time rambling on about theory. This one doesn't.  <br /> <br />It's clear that Mr. Meyers has a great deal of pracical experience in networking. The first indication of this was the picture at the beginning of the book showing the back end of a bunch of networked computers. You never saw such a mess of wires unless, of course, you walked into the closet/room where your servers are located. This is what most networks look like.  <br /> <br />The one complaint about this book that I could make is that the coverage of non-Microsoft Windows based systems is pretty minimal. In part this reflects the test, which doesn't say much about these either. Still, if you have to set up a network, there's a very good chance that it will have to include a couple of Unix/Linux/FreeBSD or whatever boxes doing things like serving web pages and handling mail.  <br /> <br />Finally, the companion CD has a complete practice examination of the format, size, and feel of the real exam.	2005-03-09

The E-Myth is the entrepreneurial myth. This says that most businesses fail because they are not founded by entrepreneurs, but by technicians. A single example of many in the book: A cook decides to start a restaurant and then goes to work, cooking, cooking, cooking.  <br /> <br />This book says you should not spend your time working on doing the work of your business, you shouldn't be cooking, you should be working on your business to make it more succesful.  <br /> <br />This book has two main themes: Part One is about the almost religious concept Mr. Gerber has to seek out the entrepreneurial urge in almost anyone and get them to thinking of a business of their own.  <br /> <br />Part Two is more on the nuts and bolts of running your own business. This part has a great deal about the standard big seven disciplines: Leadership, Marketing, Finance, Management, Client Fulfillment, Lead Conversion, Lead Generation. The Big 7 (other writers use more or fewer) are not covered in detail, but in general. Kind of a this is the way to think about these areas. That way they can cover a broader range of businesses.	2005-03-09

This means that it gets the full Apple treatment of support, documentation and an absolute guarantee that it will flawlessly work on Apple computers. <br /> <br />Logic Pro is a professional quality music production. It incorporates virtually every feature needed in music software and of course uses a graphical user interface for the user.  <br /> <br />This book opens with very basic information aimed at the novice/beginner level. It progresses through the intermediate level to end with a few chapters at the expert level. It's basic format is reference like rather than tutorial. That is, it tells you what can be done and how to do it rather than a series of do this instructions.  <br /> <br />The CD that comes with the book is tutorial based.

Some of his photographs are simply stunning. Sometimes stunning in their simplicity. For instance his pictures of the hand of the bride with her engagement ring as a point of emphasis or the picture of the flower girl holding her basket tell stories of their own, each of which is easily worth the stories thousand words.  <br /> <br />Looking at the picture ideas is worth the price of the book by themselves.

What If:  <br />General Wever hadn't been killed and he continued his development of the B-17 like Do-19 UralBomber  <br />Goering had been killed during the early stages of the Battle of Britain  <br />The new head of the Luftwaffe - Kesselring - said that he couldn't support the Sixth Army at Stalingrad and von Paulus had broken out with his army intact  <br />The ME-262 jet aircraft in its ground attack role had visited Omaha Beach in strength on D-Day.  <br /> <br />All in all, not too many changes from what really happened but the outcome would have been dramatically. So dramatically perhaps that when \\"Fat Man\\" and \\"Little Boy\\" were dropped, might they have their destinations changed from reality.	2005-03-09

If these explanations make sense to you, you might implement SCM before you look around at the software project and find that part of the source code is missing, the source code of this sub-routine doesn't match the binaries, this bug that was fixed is back, and any number of other problems.  <br /> <br />The next several chapters go into the fundamentals of SCM. This includes such things as the mundane definition of configuration numbers and the reports that need to be issued.  <br /> <br />Just when you are getting to the point where you know that this can't be done, the book goes into the SCM automation tools that are available. Chapter 16 talks about the general functions that can be performed by the SCM tools. Finally he gives a list of the most popular high-end SCM tools. (Mr. Leon - in the next edition of your book I'd like to see some comments made about each of these tools. Just a short sentence or two would be nice to help me narrow down the list of likely suppliers.) For low-end (and low-cost, even free) tools, he points you to the cmcrossroads.com web site for a comprehensive and frequently updated list of suppliers.  <br /> <br />This book is a valuable introduction to the whys and wherefores of software configuration management. It will tell management what can be expected and if you're assigned to the task, it will get you well started.	2005-03-09

The leadership role Dr. Wheatley advocates is a kindler, gentler form of management. Based on her background as a Peace Corps volounteer in Korea and a public school teacher in New York. As she sas, there is a simpler, finer way to organize human endeavor. The normal managment techniques of control and imposition of will do not produce an organization working together to learn, develop, adapt to the changing future.   <br /> <br />She says that management should follow the organization that naturally develops for people going through life. As she puts it, \\"Goodbye Command and Control.\\" <br /> <br />I can only wish that more of the managers I've worked for in the past followed her theories. I try.

It has certainly not been a pretty picture all the time. But on the hole these hundred and fifty years offer a fairly positive message.  <br /> <br />We are a long way from the institutionalized segregated legal system and the Klan of the end of the 1800's. The struggle for racial equality has been long and not always smooth, but the trend line is upward through all of this time. The conclusion reached, I think correctly, is that race relations in this country look more promising than every before.  <br /> <br />There were two points that I think were not stressed enough in this book.  <br /> <br />First is the fact that the civil rights movement of the late 60's accomplished such a large number of things, and did so without anywhere the violence that could have happened. It's one of the better things the United States Government has done, ever.  <br /> <br />Second, the author doesn't mention the role of the Army in race relations. From just after the Civil War when employment was so low among blacks, the Buffalo Soldiers offered jobs, even a career. During the Korean war Truman issued an executive order abolishing segregation in the Army. No fancy laws, no court battles, the Army was not the American society, all it took was one executive order. The end result of this, of course, was Colin Powell.  <br /> <br />Good History of Our Time.	2005-03-09

I believe that the changes the Internet and associated technologies such as e-mail will bring to the nonprofit sector is as big as was the printing press or the computer.  <br /> <br />It's hard to imagine an organization of any size, be for-profit or non-profit that isn't using a computer to keep track of doners, interested people, maintain the mailing list, and of course word processing and budgeting. There was a challenge that organizations had to face when computers came out, and now there is a challenge in what to do with the Internet.  <br /> <br />This is a book intended to give managers an insight into what the Internet can do for their organization. It talks about what can be done using the Internet to give you ideas of how it might fit into your organization. In some areas like connecting your database to the web site, it doesn't get into the technical ways to do it, just the concept.  <br /> <br />It's a good way to get started, and it's something that you're going to have to do sooner or later.	2005-03-08

Ilyushin to specialize in the design of light combat aircraft. (Tupolev was to design heavy aircraft)  <br /> <br />The first design was a fighter which was never built. The second design was the famous IL-1 Shturmovik ground attack aircraft. In various versions, this had the highest production quantity of any World War II airplane, and probably of any airplane ever.   <br /> <br />During World War II the bureau also produced a series of light or medium bombers, but production volumes were small when compared to the IL-2.  <br /> <br />After the war the Ilyushin bureau moved into jets with a series of medium bombers such as the IL-28.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile beginning in 1943 the bureau began to explore the design of a twin engine passenger liner. This plane the IL-12 became the DC-3 equivalent of Russia, and began a line of passenger planes that has continued until the present day.   <br /> <br />This book is a complete story of Ilyushin, covering virtually every aircraft, every variation that they have built. It's information that has simply not been available in the west, unless perhaps you worked for Air Force Intelligence. This is part of a series of books put together by Midland Publishing, all of which are great. <br />	2005-03-08

The Soviets established design bureaus in the areas of Germany they controlled and continued the development of the Jumo engines. But by 1946 Soviet designs were put into production that passed the performance of the Junkers engines.  <br /> <br />Likewise the early airframes of the Soviet jets looked a lot like the Arado. But soon the Russian designs had moved beyond the German into designs that looked much the designs being produced in the US and England.  <br /> <br />This book has a tremendous amount of detail and a huge number of photographs of these late 1940 designs. I can only guess that this book became possible only with the relaxing of tensions at the end of the Soviet Union. It's a most interesting book, and it's just part of a series put together on Soviet aircraft by Midland Publishing. <br />	2005-03-08

Big time sports are big time entertainment.  <br /> <br />No one thinks it strange at all when an aging movie star gets a face lift, a boob job, and of course not one gray hair.

In this case he is going for drugs rather than the plastic surgeon's knife, but really, what's the difference.  <br /> <br />In this book Jose Canseco says that he considered himself to be a living laboratory to test so many of the various kinds of body altering drugs that he became known as \\"The Chemist.\\" He also says that he considered himself to be an entertainer.

There have been studies in the past, indeed a body of knowledge even, on the design of paper based forms. The problem with computer based forms such as those for ordering a book from Amazon is that the forms tend to be generated by programmers, not forms specialists. In fact in this book the examples being used are from a hypothetical on line book store.  <br /> <br />At one point the authors are giving an example of a book page of an online bookshop. On it they give an abstract of their own (that is this) book. It reads: \\"What is the business logic of n enterprise system? How do I specify it in such a way that I  know how to transform it into a running system, by skill and by automated tool support? This book gives a self-contained introduction to the modeling and development of business logic for enterprise systems.\\"  <br /> <br />In practice, the authors develop a couple of new technologies for the modelling of such forms. Page Diagrams are analagous to flow charts that show what a page does in terms of its interactions. From the home or Welcome page you can go register, go login, look at suggested books, do a search, etc. What links to what? What logic applies (bad password for instance, or is this user logged in). The page diagram is a way for the non-technical manager and the programmer to define exactly what a page or screen is supposed to do. It can become part of the specification that the programmer uses to produce what management wants.  <br /> <br />The next concept the authors develop is the Form Storyboard. The storyboard shows pages with respect to the actions they cause in the server.  <br /> <br />Other models such as information pages, and data interchange complete the description of the forms related system. For the most part, HTML based web sites are used as examples in this book. But the same kind of modelling is equally applicable to form/database related system such as accounting, payroll orother business applications.  <br /> <br />Using the approach developed by these authors is the best way I've seen to document/specify/design a forms based interactive system.	2005-03-08

It lasted until 1865, almost 250 years. Originally not just a southern institution, New York City had as many as 10,000 slaves at the end of the 1700's.  <br /> <br />The stories of slave holding has been told many times, from the movies like Uncle Tom's Cabin, to Roots, to Ken Burns series The Civil War. This book brings a concise overall view to slavery and seems to draw on a wealth of original schlorship. The photographs are not those commonly seen in such histories.  <br /> <br />This book covers more of the slave rebellions than most. The famous incidents like the Dred Scott case, the Harpers Ferry raid of John Brown and so on are covered, but so are rebellions of a smaller and much less well known nature. Some of the slaves brought to the US had been military leaders in Africa. They had the martial thoughts and training to forment true rebellion of a type that absolutely terrified the Southern slave owners.  <br /> <br />The book basically ends at the end of the Civil War when slavery as a legal institution ended. The story of the continuing African American struggles to find equality belong in other books.  <br /> <br />One final thought. Slavery existed in the South because of cotton, and particularily the difficulty of separating the cotton seed from the fiber. By the mid 1800's slavery was still in power, but the impact of the cotton gin was beginning to make slavery uneconomical. An interesting what if -- would slavery have ended within a few years even if the Civil War had not been fought.	2005-03-08

I learned to not listen as the nightly news droned on endlessly about the case. As a result I picked up this book to get a quick overall view of the case, as admittedly seen by one person. I'm glad I did. Surprisingly this book says more about life than I was really expecting.  <br /> <br />Amber Frey is, unfortunately an example of a very large number of women desparately seeking love, companionship, a happy life. The view she presents of her side of a relationship she hoped would provide these things was insightful and sad.  <br /> <br />After she learned about the true situation with Scott Peterson, she began working with the police. In turn the book becomes an interesting insight into police procedure. As she taped telephone calls and reported to the police. I found myself wondering if the police cared that they were asking this girl to associate with a murderer.  <br /> <br />Finally the description of the trial itself and the description of the legal system and press reporting was good, but a bit too short. It seems that the system exists to chew up people for the system's own ends, regardless of the effect on people.  <br /> <br />All in all, I come away hoping that Ms. Frey finds the happiness that I think we all deserve.	2005-03-08

His term is the Re-Enchantment of war by which he means the re-humanizing of warfare after a period of de-humanizing automation.  <br /> <br />I find myself remembering a walk through the battlefield at Kennesaw mountain. Inbetween the Northern and Southern lines were the pits in which forward pickets or skirmishers lay watching for an unexpected attack. The lesson to me was clear. Here were men saying this is my hole in the ground, and you don't get past me while I'm alive.  <br /> <br />Today we are involved with a mission in Iraq where every day it seems that one or two soldiers are killed. They are killed one at a time, not in some kind of mass killing machine, but one  at a time. How has this changed since Concord or Thermopylae?  <br /> <br />The author proposes a great difference in warfare as will be conducted by technologically advanced powers and others. Perhaps. The power at the disposal of the technically advanced soldier is going to make the battlefield a very lonely place. Concentrations of men will become targets. Machines may fight machines, but as the old Army saying goes, Boots on the ground will win the war. <br />	2005-03-08

All kinds of fancy airplanes have been designed and built to get a gun pointed at the enemy.  <br /> <br />World War II was fought with a set of airplanes that fit into a very small segment of time. The last biplanes were built about 1940, and the first jets about 1944. But World War II was fought (largely) with piston engined monoplanes armed with machine guns.  <br /> <br />The British studies showed that they were primarily fighting unarmored aircraft that would be best attacked with rifle caliber machine gune. The Americans were in love with their .50 caliber machine guns. The Germans, faced with the problem of shooting down the heavily armed American bombers favored heavier cannon that could fire explosive shells.  <br /> <br />This is the story of the guns used by the air forces fighting World War II.

The whole country watched for months while the negeotiations were carried out to free the crew.  <br /> <br />What wasn't known for many years was the fact that this was part of the biggest intelligence loss the United States ever had.  <br /> <br />The Pueblo was filled with the most secret intelligence euipment the US posessed at that time. Equipment not unlike that found on U-110, the German Enigma machine. Knowing that this most secret equipment was now in the hands of the North Koreans the United States immediately changed its codes. After all, like the Enigma, the equipment wasn't useful without the codes. Unknown at the time was that the North Koreans immediately invited the Russians to examine/study, maybe even take home, the machines.  <br /> <br />But during this time, the Walker spy ring was supplying the Russians with the daily codes. For years during this critical time in the Cold War, the Russians were \\"reading our mail.\\"  <br /> <br />The Pueblo is a story of arrogance on the Navy's part that created an attitude of infallibility and confidence that no one would ever attack a U.S. Navy ship.

The first key is to spend more time in the definition or requirements phase. This means establishing communications channels, standards and guidelines, and a detailed set of specifications that are agreed upon by all. Finally there is testing. Often left until it is the last item on the schedule, testing needs to be moved closer to the front. Catching bugs earlier means that they aren't there in the finished project.  <br /> <br />The second key is to establish the project management structure. This includes breaking the project down into a set of requirements that meets the agreed upon specifications. This can then be used to establish a critical path for the development. Corporate software engineering principles can be used to produce code that is easy to maintain, read, and extend to additional requirements. There are a number of management tools that have been developed to assist in this phase. Several of the more common tools are included on the CD furnished with the book, some of them trial versions with time limitations that can be examined to see if they fit your needs.	2005-03-07

And I've been fascinated with the German use of the half track configuration.  <br /> <br />This book answered all of my questions. The German half tracks, which came in a wide range of sizes had much better tracks than did the American M2/M3 (It was said that the American machines had rubber bands for tracks), but the German units were not four wheel drive. The little motorcycle looking halftrack was not a tracked motorcycle, but a small prime mover used to do things like haul aircraft around the field. And I've decided that what I really want is a Volkswagon Schwimmwagon, the four wheel drive amphibious vehicle (You can see of these at the Heartland Museum of Military Vehicles just off I-80 at Lexington, Nebraska.)  <br /> <br />This book has more photographos of German military vehicles than I would have thought existed.

In the play, the money comes in from Eva Peron's actions in setting up a charity and getting the money from the rich landowners (and quite possibly from the Germans Nazi's wanting to move to Argentina to escape trial and punishment at the Nurnburg trials).  <br /> <br />In this book though, the money is coming from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and Wall Street. And the money was coming in amounts that Eva couldn't have imagined. The catch was that this money was coming in as debts. It was being spent in ways that were not productive enough to pay off the debts. More money could be borrowed and used to pay the interest creating a spiral that was never ending.  <br /> <br />But all such things eventually end. And one day the IMF turned its back on Argentina.

Even in World War I, the great reputation of the machine gun was really undeserved as most of the killing was done by artillery.  <br /> <br />In its earliest days, when artillery was just a tube closed at one end, artillery was the thing that ended the building of castles.  <br /> <br />In the Iraq war, the allied forces fielded some 1,600 of the big guns, and had a large number on call if they should be needed later.  <br /> <br />This book is, as the title says, a history. It's fairly general in nature, talking about the big changes that have occurred through history. For instance there's a fair amount about the famous French 75, the competitive Krupp 77mm is given less attention and the similar Japanese Type 38 barely mentioned. It's just not a big enough book to cover everything.  <br /> <br />For a book covering the 600/800 year history of artillery, it presents the highlights often avoided in books on the artillery of only a short period like say the Americna Civil War.

It is applicable to the individual, the architect, or to builders.  <br /> <br />This is not a book of specific housing designs, instead it is a book that looks at each aspect of house building from foundation, to framing, to all the other aspects like plumbing, wiring, heating, etc. The intent is that you incorporate these elements into your house design, perhaps by building your own home, or by discussions with the various sub-contractors that you employ to do the actual work.  <br /> <br />The building techniques discussed here are rather minor modifications to conventional designs. You might want to also read Your Engineered House which looked at making drastic changes in the way a house was built.	2005-03-04

I looked at a lot of Access books, but none of them went into Access SQL. For that alone this book is worth five stars.  <br /> <br />This book starts with a bit of discussion on the fundamentals of a relational database, but not too much. After all, this is covered in all the Access books. It quickly gets into the fundamentals of SQL itself.  <br /> <br />I was a bit concerned when he started using the Microsoft graphical design tools to create the database, but he quickly went into using SQL CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE commands. From there on he went on to a reasonable complete but elementary discussion on using most the the rest of SQL.  <br /> <br />You gotta have a few complaints, so:  <br /> <br />There is discussion in the book, including a list of reserved words for SQL:2003. But Access doesn't talk SQL:2003. It doesn't even talk SQL:92, it's an extended SQL:89. A list of Access reserved words would have been nice.  <br /> <br />He doesn't talk about the two database engines in Access, Jet and MSDE; and these two engines speak very different dialects of SQL.	2005-03-04

They were designed to allow you to play what if senarios. You can change this part of the budget to see what the effect is over there.  <br /> <br />But beyond the spread sheet functionality Excel has numerous functions and capabilities to do all kinds of analysis capabilities.  <br /> <br />This book is on using these functions to perform a whole range of statistical functions. Not only does this book cover the functions themselves, but gives the background and description of what this particular kind of function is doing. Both numerical analysis and charting functions are included and in detail.  <br /> <br />Don't skip the part in this book called the Part of Tens. This section in the For Dummies books often has some interesting points, but here the summation of statistical limitations is just great. <br />	2005-03-04

The author says that all of the SQL examples have been tested using MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, Microsoft Access, and Oracle 10g. That says that the SQL used in the examples has to be very general in nature and not take advantage of newer and more powerful commands that have come about since these programs were written (particularly Access which uses the Jet engine that's more or less compliant with SQL:89).  <br /> <br />This is not a bad approach, because while you might miss out on some of the nifty commands, your code will be compatiable with virtually any database that you are using. You will find comments in the book like when discussing the substring function he says \\"MS Access doesn't utilize the SUBSTRING() function. Instead, it employs the MID() function....\\" I don't know how he could have done it any differently without writing five different books.  <br /> <br />This is an excellent beginning book. Use it to get started and to understand the concepts behind the SQL language. Then you may want to get a higher level book on the particular database you are using.	2005-03-04

Or to express it another way, if the automobiles you make are 99% good, you'll have 3 warranty defects per automobile. If your cars are six sigma, you can expect one warranty claim for every 980 new cars.  <br /> <br />This book is mostly about the analysis you need to make of your production line to eleminate errors. It's about the statistical analysis you need to do to be sure that you're operating at six sigma.  <br /> <br />This book is a great place to start learning about six sigma. It's enough to give you the background you'll need to really begin analyzing your process.  <br /> <br />I have to say that it probably isn't enough for you to get to a six sigma production line. You'll need more, more classes, more time, more software, more management support than you ever expected. As best I understand, Motorola pioneered the six sigma concept. And I don't believe they ever got most of their production lines to operate at that level. In fact I've heard that they were only able to get their diode line running that error free.  <br /> <br />Good Luck. Get Started. <br />	2005-03-04

The whole book consisted of just a few letters. In those days the mail moved slowly. With a lot of time being used in the communications channel, Burke could and did take the time to write long, well thought out letters that were really more like essays than simple letters.  <br /> <br />With the advent of faster communications in the form of trains and then airplanes, letter got more frequent and shorter.  <br /> <br />The latest changes are of course the internet and e-mail. Now communications with people across the office or across the world are all but instantaneous regardless of the distance. In turn this the length of the \\"documents\\" has gotten shorter. Today I exchanged e-mails with a person somewhere (I really don't know where) about a movie. We sent each other about three messages in only a few minutes.  <br /> <br />This book is a series of essays on the Networked Society. It is written by a networked series of sociologists and other specialists at universities from Moscow to Barcelona to New York. They explore the impact of computer networking in terms of our society as it is developing. The essays include the development of the Internet in China where strong censorship is in place to the defacto split between the haves and have nots in regard to acces to information.  <br /> <br />This book explores the overall implications of the evolving world. <br />	2005-03-04

There are lots of books on both C and Linux. This one ties the two areas together.  <br /> <br />The C language is a general language with applications on many operating systems. Linux, of course is one operating system that can use C. Inbetween the two lie the areas of taking the raw language and turning the code into an application that can actually be of use to someone.  <br /> <br />Contained within the GNU/Linux system are many software packages to establish the programming environment. There's the compiler and operating system. But more than that are systems to optimize the resulting code, to combine the program you wrote with other standardized routines from the system. These other utility programs have names like gcov, gprof, automake and so on. To the newcommer to GNU/Linux, there is a bewildering array of names (that only kind of make sense) for programs that ease your development task.  <br /> <br />In addition there's discussion on various programming concepts such as the Linux file system, programming threads, piped, sockets and so on. Again, these are areas that are part of the standard GNU/Linux system but which are discussed here in ways to make them useful to the applications developer.  <br /> <br />This is a carefully positioned book that will be of great help to the beginning developer.	2005-03-04

We all read about networking protocols but here you get to see them in action and without a whole laboratory full of equipment. This book is based on a series of experiments that you can do yourself using a network protocol analyzer. Aaaaah, there's a buzzword, network protocol analyzer. This book is written around using Ethereal, a software network protocol analyzer that is included on the CD that comes with the book (but you may want to download the latest version - it's open source software and free).  <br /> <br />So in this book you don't just read about network protocols, you analyze them yourself using this software package. You get to actually see what the various packages like your internet browser are actually sending and receiving. This is a great way to remove the mystery of what networks are actually doing.  <br /> <br />At the end of the book there is some discussion and illustrations of ways networks get attacked. There's quite a bit of discussion and demonstration of what the Blaster worm does, including the network traces of its action.  <br /> <br />Great Concept, Great Implementation.	2005-03-04

Turns out that regular expressions are nothing more than the \\"wildcards\\" from a lot of applications like Microsoft Word that have been generalized to fit a lot of applications in text processing.  <br /> <br />For instance you may want to examine an incoming field from an internet form. If the data is going to a social security column in a database, you want to be sure that the data doesn't say something like Fred-34-1234. It's the right format, but alpha isn't a good thing to have there. If this isn't checked form, it may wait until the SQL Insert statement blows up.  <br /> <br />The generalized form of expressions like this can be used to check things like SSN formats, the proper formation of an e-mail address and a lot of other things commonly needed in text processing.  <br /> <br />Many languages both programming and scripting have provisions built into them to handle this kind of text processing. This book provides the generalized background to use regular expressions in ways that that you haven't considered but which you'll find very useful. <br />	2005-03-04

Most of them fought through the entire war and surprisingly most of them survived the war, few without wounds. These are not stories of high ranking officers, but of ordinary soldiers of rather low rank who did their job very, very well. They fought in all the theaters of war from freezing in Russia to burning up in Africa.  <br /> <br />I am sure that there were men like these in all armies, but these men happened to be German. We can only be happey that they didn't have a whole lot more men like these.	2005-03-04

But I've known several of them socially. To a person they have absolutely loathed their fellow professors and this was minor when compared to the abject hatred they have felt for the school administration.  <br /> <br />The struggle going on at Harvard, as detailed in this book, has to be considered to be very amusing. Whatever an outsider president said or does at a place like Harvard is going to be completely picked apart by the staff, the press, the student body, and probably by the janitors who don't even speak English.  <br /> <br />The universities are far more liberal than the rest of American society. They are the absolute temples of Political Correctness. When the president of Harvard said that perhaps the reason fewer women succeed in math and science may be due to gender differences, the world fell in.  <br /> <br />Note he said \\"MAY\\" as in something to talk about, something to research, hopefully to reach a definitive conclusion. But no, the decisions are already made, there is no room for discussion, no need to do research. Here in the supposed center of intellectual freedom, open minded research, etc. etc. In the end, the president apologized, and only the resentment remains.  <br /> <br />This book is an unauthorized investigation of the reign of the current president of Harvard. While I can't say that the book is an attack on him, it certainly isn't very sympathetic.	2005-03-03

And the result has to be considered pretty good. President Bush seems to have a very definite set of ideas, and to be marching towards their implementation. You don't really know what's going on in the Government until the books from insiders start coming out, and this is a good one. Mr. Fleischer is an admirer of President Bush, and it shows.  <br /> <br />The second major subject of this book is the national press.  They get, Mr. Fleischer says, a thousand facts right every day. But he says the press's first and most pressing bias is in favor of conflict and fighting. This is what gets the headlines. Having Mr. A contradict what Ms. B said gets the headlines, and we outsiders here the conflict and not necessarily what's really happening.  <br /> <br />The next thing he comments on is the so called liberal bias of the press. He asks:  <br /> <br />Clinton allowed family planning broups that advocate abortion to receive Federal funds; the press reported he \\"delivered on his campaign promise.\\" Bush reversed this action; the press reported he \\"did something to quickly please the right flank in his party.\\" Why didn't they say Bush \\"delivered on his campaign promise?\\"  <br /> <br />Right-wing and conservative are standard ways the press describes Republicans, why aren't the Democrats described as left-wing or liberals?  <br /> <br />Debates about abortion are called debates about \\"abortion rights.\\" Debates about guns are described as debates about \\"gun control\\", not \\"gun rights.\\"  <br /> <br />The \\"religious right\\" is a press term, why is there no discussion of the \\"religious left?\\"	2005-03-03

In addition the text now corresponds to the suggestions from Computing Curricula 2001 for teaching operating systems.<br /><br />Most of the book is on general purpose operating systems such as Linux and those from Microsoft. But at the end of the book there are chapters on other types of operating such as Real Time Operating Systems and MultiMedia OS's.<br /><br />Finally there are some chapters which the authors call case studies. In these, one chapter goes into a detailed discussion of Linux, another chapter covers Windows XP. Chapter 23 covers several early operating systems that helped to define the features that make up modern os's. These include: Atlas, XDX-940, THE, RC 4000, CTSS, MULTICS, OS/360, and MACH, along with brief mentions of several others.<br /><br />Note that this not a book on how to use operating systems, this is a book on how operating systems are designed.

So when I saw this book it was of immediate interest. Then one of the first pictures was of the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite, built of concrete because of the fire danger.  <br /> <br />There are then several photographs of the hotel, showing design points that were built into the structure when it was constructed in 1926. As the author says, the innovative use of concrete in the hotel opens a whole new set of thoughts about how to build using concrete. From there he goes on to discussing floors, walls, countertops, and as he puts it, 'the untimate kitchen.'  <br /> <br />This is, to me, an idea book. It serves to illustrate what some very creative people have done to produce some most interesting designs that look like they will last a very long time, and be quite inexpensive.	2005-03-03

It is mostly on the details of the competitive designs being proposed by Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

It seems that the history books mostly assume that the presidents have burst forth as adults ready to assume the mangle of leadership.  <br /> <br />As I read about the various presidents I was struck by the differences in the families. Three like Clinton had fathers who died before they were born. Some (Kennedy/Bush) had very successful fathers (at least in terms of money). Some (Nixon/Lincoln) were quite poor. Some (Kennedy again) would push their children very hard. Some (Bush) merely strived to set the best possible examples for their children.  <br /> <br />Out of all of these backgrounds came basically honorable men who had the drive and ambition to lead the country.  <br /> <br />With the release of the private tapes made by the author of conversations with George W. Bush, it is unfortunately likely that the message of the book will become confused with the incident. This is a good book presenting an aspect of the presidency that breaks new ground.	2005-03-02

The new flu has a mortality rate of 72%. Depending on the version of the plague you are talking about, the mortality was just about the same. Six centuries ago medicine knew nothing about the bacteria that caused plague, now we know little about the virus causing the avian flu.  <br /> <br />This book almost seems to be several books in one.  <br /> <br />First it's a history, drawing on original source material -- contemporary letters, diaries, and chronicles. It's a history, not only of the 1300's, but of Shiro Ishii and his experiments as commander of the Japanese Army's biological warfare unit during World War II that deliberately infected the Chinese city of Changteh.  <br /> <br />Second it's a text, the nature of the plague, how it spreads, where, why, and how. It has a discussion of the various types of plague, and some discussion that the disease may not have been plague at all but possibly anthrax or an Ebola-like filovirus.  <br /> <br />Third, it's a warning. With modern day transportation, not only of people on airplanes, but thousands of containers coming in with products made almost anywhere in the world. And that doesn't take in the possibility of deliberate attacks.  <br /> <br />The writing style in this book is fascinating, a delight to read and the information content is very high and unfortunately it coule be timely.	2005-03-02

His search has taken him back into history and finally a trip to India doing research.<br /><br />Extensively researched and referenced this is a very interesting trip into the explanation of magic. When I first picked it up, because of the title, I expected to put it down again quickly. Instead I found the writing style and the content to be fascinating and didn't put it down.<br /><br />Every so often I get some kind of story in an e-mail describing something that just makes so much sense that it had to have happened. It's nice to know that such urban legends didn't just start with the Internet, but a long time ago.<br /><br />The Indian Rope Trick - a totally made up story - in Chicago - nothing to do with India at all. Then magicians had to come up with a way to do it. Strange world.	2005-03-02

It's how to find, look at, and understand your own skills, abilities, personality traits, values, dreams, and passions.  <br /> <br />Once you understand where you are and where you're coming from, you have the basis for making some decisions about where you want to go. Then you can use this knowledge to find a better job, to start a business or whatever.  <br /> <br />Dan Miller then covers the fundamentals of finding the new job, or the new business. It's an interesting combination of a self-help and business advice. <br />	2005-03-02

This is the first book that I've found that come from the pointy end of the stick. Charlie Company was there where the action was from beginning to after the end of the war.  <br /> <br />The tasks that they performed illustrate how varied training is useful. What you really find in combat is not what you expected, and the ability to be flexible to handle any situation is of paramount importance.  <br /> <br />The second point of this book is the pride we should all feel in how our young men handled themselves in a very nasty situation. Regardless of our feelings towards the war, our young men did good.  <br /> <br />Finally the actions of Charlie Company and the rest of the after action reports need to be carefully examined. It's sad, but this is almost certainly not the last time that we will put such young men in harms way. What did we do right, what went wrong, how can intelligence be improved, and what really killed Red Two?	2005-03-02

And that set of friends who are trying to help? What a tremendous amount of emotional baggage we carry around, with the help of various friends and past lovers who just can't seem to get out of our lives.  <br /> <br />Haven't we all looked at someone, been attracted and for whatever reason did no followup. Anybody that good looking must be attached. Or what can I say that doesn't sound too dumb? Or, I'm just plain afraid.  <br /> <br />And what an author that can bring this story to paper in one of the funniest, sexiest stories of the year. It's a masterpiece of what can go wrong in the dating game.  <br /> <br />The ending required the ending commentary. A good novel should tell more than a story. It should leave you with some thoughts. Afterburn certainly does that. There are a lot of cliches that fit but that would be telling.  <br /> <br />I'm glad to see that there's a sequel coming, these characters are too good to just drop.	2005-03-02

Army Book Series)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A Good Analysis of a Good Man Having a Very Bad Day	General Short is remembered as the General who parked the airplanes wing tip to wing tip on the Hawaiian airfields around Pearl Harbor. Like the title of this book that one day is what we remember of General Short. We don't remember the forty years of Army service that Gen. Short put in before that day. Nor do we remember the years of life afterward. This is a biography of all of his life. But of course a major part of the book is on the one day.  <br /> <br />On the whole the book is quite sympathetic to Short. For instance, this book says: \\"Aboard the Graceful Matsonia, steaming west through Pacific swells, Walter Short had plenty of time to think about the command that awaited him.\\" Henry Clausen's book Pearl Harbor Final Judgement says, \\"Gen Herron [previous Army commander in Hawaii] prepared the briefing book for Short about how to defend Hawaii. But Short read a novel [on the ship to Hawaii], not the briefing book, and never asked Herron a single question about what his new job as Army commander in Hawaii entailed.\\"  <br /> <br />I don't know that it matters what Gen. Short read or didn't read on the way over. But there is no question that parking the planes wing tip to wing tip was a mistake, and it is clear that a couple of other mistakes were made, and Gen. Short gets the blame for them.  <br /> <br />After Pearl everyone in the Army, the Navy, in Hawaii, in Washington and every where else tried to look innocent and pointed the finger at the two men in command. There were enough mistakes made to cover everyone. Forty years of peacetime Army service did not prepare this sixty year old general for what was going to happen. Indeed, the country wasn't prepared for what was going to happen. The inter service rivalry between the Army and the Navy was unbelievable. Could or would any general have done any better?  <br /> <br />I think the last sentence in the book sums everything up pretty well: \\"While the Japanese prepared to demonstrate the new power projectiontactics of seaborne attack from aircraft carriers, American officials and outpost commanders struggled to respond to a rapidly deteriorating situation in the Pacific with poorly coordinated national command and regional defense procedures basically unchanged since 1898.\\" <br />	2005-03-01

It starts with a general description of sailing ships of the time and the specific design goals specified for this ship. From there it goes into the actual construction; everything from the various trades needed to build the ship to the types of wood used and the men assigned to the ship.  <br /> <br />The main battles in which the Constitition fought were during the War of 1812, where the design of the ship was proven correct. Bigger than the smaller English frigates, faster than the bigger English ships. Well crewed, well officered, well armed, well handled the Constitution served the United States very well. Various other duties were handled well until about the time of the Civil War when wooden sailing ships were nearing the end of their practical lives.  <br /> <br />After the Civil War the story of the Constitution is one of preservation, rebuilding, and increasing respect as this the oldest ship on the active duty roster in the world remains an object of veneration. <br />	2005-03-01

The colleges that would like to have the player hopefully lead them to championships, the agents, the shoe companies seeking yet another name to hang on their wall all begin to work their own special interests.   <br /> <br />To a young man from the projects, this has to be bewildering.

Now it's the turn of Billy the Kid.  <br /> <br />The conventional wisdom is that he was killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett on July 14, 1881 in Fort Sumner, New Mexico. But after the shooting Pat Garrett called out to the deputies nearby, Boys, that was the Kid, and I think I have got him. But upon seing the dead man's face, the other deputy said, You have shot the wrong man.  <br /> <br />Nearly seventy years later an investigation involved with and estate settlement began to lead to suspission that one of the participants was actually Billy the Kid. And after some discussion the ninety year old man admitted that he was indeed the Kid.  <br /> <br />This book details the investigation and the life of the Kid after having been 'killed' in 1881.  <br /> <br />Is there evidence? Yes! Is there proof? No! Is it an interesting book? Definitely! <br />	2005-03-01

Books	5	12	17	N	N	The Definitive Book	This book is clearly the definitive book on the subject. Extensively researched this book covers every aspect of enforced sex from the literature (going back to Greek times), from history as in the rape of Nanking and the Russian use of rape in Berlin almost as a matter of policy, and even in the animal kingdom.  <br /> <br />The authors also attempt to identify the causes rape using mental illnesses or more particularily the personality disorders as a contributing factor. Other aspects such as the relationship of pornography with rape are investigated (and in the case of porn it appears that the almost explosive growth of porn in recent years is lowering rape incidence).  <br /> <br />The ending chapters list several areas where treatments have been tried with mixed results, and give several areas where additional research is indicated. This is a splendid work on the subject, and may remain the definitive work unless the directions indicated here point the direction to additional research. <br />	2005-03-01

The ex-soldiers felt they were owed something and Congress didn't want to foot the bill.  <br /> <br />This reached a climax in 1932 in the middle of the depression when some 45,000 First World War vets marched on Washington to demand payment of the bonus they had been promised for enlisting. Congress, well you guessed it.  <br /> <br />Herbert Hoover ordered General Douglas MacArthur o break them up, and then he used tanks, tear gas and bayonets to clear them out. And FDR said, This will elect me.  <br /> <br />This is the story of the bonus Army from its start to the after effects that occured many years later when the GI Bill was given to the World War II vets to prevent such a thing happening again.  <br /> <br />This book is based on a great deal of original research including interviews with surviving participants. This is a little known but important part of recent American history that still affects life today. <br />	2005-02-28

The main thing that this novel does is make you ask what other such excellent novels must lay hidden in foreign languages or used book stores.  <br /> <br />This book is nominally about the world of a young boy growing up in Lima, partly the real world in which he lives, partly in the play world where he goes on imaginary adventures in his great-grandfathers ornate, moldering carriage that has been stored in the carriage house.  <br /> <br />This book is also about two other worlds, that of the well to do aristocratic family being pressured by changes happening in their world. And about that of the Indian servants who have come down out of the Andes seeking employment.  <br /> <br />Like most of the best novels, the story grabs your attention as the characters and location become real, even though you've never been there. It took me back to my own Grandfathers garage, filled with musty relics from his younger years.	2005-02-28

It is the language used for business, for air traffic control and of course the Internet. Quite an accomplishment for what began as a minor Germanic dialect in about the year 500.   <br /> <br />This book is a history of the language itself. How did the language become so important? The Church fought the publishing of the Bible in English because this would allow anyone to read it rather than just the official priests.  <br /> <br />Part of the reason for the spread of English has been the wealth of literature written in English. From Beowulf to Chaucer and of course the vulgar playwright William Shakespeare (who contributed 2,000 new words to the language).  <br /> <br />The growth of English continues in spite of things like France making it illegal to use English words where good French words could be used. And English continues to change, the English of India for instance allows computer support desks to be located in Mumbai, but communication is not all that easy.  <br /> <br />A most interesting book.	2005-02-28

And a lot can be seen in the modern American Army that reflects a need to stop the Russians from coming through the Fulda Gap. As just one example, the Humvee is just about ideal for fighting a battle in Germany (from well behind the front lines). It has been much less successful as a vehicle to use in patrolling in unfriendly places where even a little bit of armor would be a great help.  <br /> <br />Now the military thinkers are beginning to recognize that the new enemy isn't going to come at us with untold thousands of main battle tanks. In this book I see, for the first time a recognition that the splinter groups of Islamic militants are being considered as an enemy and some analysis is being made as to how to fight them.  <br /> <br />If I had room here I'd quote Ralph Peters entire essay. He points out the futility of the basic tenents of the militants thoughts, deeds, and actions. The bad parts would be what would happen if al-Queda were able to take over the oil producing countries.  <br /> <br />Finally are the articles on the impact of the information technology on the battlefield. In the attack in Iraq, smaller American and British forces were able to demolish much larger Iraqi forces. It reminded me of the days of the British Empire where the breech loading rifles and the Maxim machine gun were up against flintlocks and spears.	2005-02-25

Originally developed by Sun for their own systems, Solaris was originally based on the AT&T System V and the Berkeley BSD. This is not a Linux, this is a fullfledged Unix, directly traceable to the AT&T source code.  <br /> <br />Needless to say, since Sun developed Java in the first place, the integration of Java into the operating system is better than with any other.  <br /> <br />This book, as you just might guess from the title, covers System 10 completely from installation to using the various application packages that come with it.	2005-02-24

Lots of color pictures, lots of pictures showing the tanks in action.  <br /> <br />The author, a former British Army officer clearly knows his tank history. He pulls out some very obscure details about the various models, the troubles that model gave when it was new and far more.  <br /> <br />In the book the tanks are listed in the order in which they entered service. The last tank mentioned is the British Challenger that began service in 1991. This implies that no new tanks have been designed in fourteen years. To be sure, there have been upgrades, and he discusses these in some depth, but no new ones.  <br /> <br />I didn't count them, but I'd guess that the book covers about a hundred different tanks. Of course it begins with the World War I developments and it spends a lot of time on the World War II designs. It's one of the more complete books I've seen.	2005-02-24

Books	5	6	7	N	N	Two Men Making Fundamental Changes in our Society	Sub-Title: Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Laws That Changed America  <br /> <br />There seems to be a time when things happen. One of those times was forty years has passed since the 1965 Voting Rights Act was made into law. This was a time when two men rose to change the world.  <br /> <br />Lyndon Johnson was a southern politician put on John Kennedy's ticket to help bring the south to the democrats. Then suddenly he was president, with the experience and skills that a lifetime in the Senate tought him about getting bills through Congress.  <br /> <br />No less important was the input from Dr. King who had to combine the power of many disparate civil rights groups to speak with one voice.  <br /> <br />Finally it almost seems that a third name, that of J. Edgar Hoover should be in the title. Hoover was a notorious racist and actively worked to break the two men apart. The amazing thing is that this quiet revolution came about with so little violence. <br /> <br />It's only when the books like this come out that you really get a feeling of what happened. The writings of the time are by people with an axe to grind.	2005-02-24

I remember talking to an English Lit professor about the first time he was introduced to Mozart. He asked me when I first heard Mozart and how thrilled I was. Unfortunately I'm basically tone deaf and neither Mozart or the others give me thrills. But then I tried to explain to him the way I felt when I first discovered calculus. Mere words failed me.  <br /> <br />Dr. Lightman is much better with words than I am. He is able to convey the sense of awe, even astonishment when something is finally understood. And the more you know about advanced physics the more mysterious it becomes.  <br /> <br />This is not a book of physics, this is a book of awe. Beautiful writing.	2005-02-24

Modern cameras and video editing software make the production of a movie far different than it was in the days of film. In fact, the authors recommend that you start with a quite basic camers. They are much easier to use, while the professional level cameras have so many controls and adjustments that using them becomes a task in itself.  <br /> <br />The video editing software package that the authors use is based on the Apple computer (don't tell me you're surprised at this), but they also list several packages that run on Windows and which do a perfectly acceptable job of editing.  <br /> <br />The CD that comes with the book contains a movie, the script and directors comments on that movie and video clips that you can use for practice editing. There are also several sound files suitable for editing. The demo software included on the disk is mostly Apple oriented.	2005-02-24

It's also a story of determination, heroism, and bedrock patriotism. The story is pretty simple. Capt. Rozelle was on patrol in Iraq, riding in a Humvee when it set off an anti-tank mine. It shredded his right foot, which was amputated shortly thereafter.  <br /> <br />There are two main points worth mentioning about this book. First is the story of rebuilding his abilities after his injury. What I found to be perhaps more important were his comments about the actions of of the troops in Iraq. As he simply says, his injury was a result of terrorism. We are fighting the terrorists in Iraq rather than here in this country.  <br /> <br />As a hint if you meet another amputee, Capt. Rozelle reports on the comments that people make when they learn that he lost a foot. His favorite is: \\"Bartender, bring this man a drink and put it on my tab.\\"	2005-02-24

He covers how they are recruited, abducted or conscripted, trained and finally set off to fight in whatever hot spot is active at the moment.  <br /> <br />The one surprising thing about this book is that it treats this as a new problem. War has always been a young persons game. To read the biographies of woldiers of World War II, a surprising number lied about their age to join the army at fifteen or sixteen years of age. In the American Civil War around 100,000 soldiers were fifteen or younger. A surprising, but unknown number were under ten. The pictures of the end of the Third Reich show young boys greeting Hitler. The first American killed in Afghanistan was shot by a 14 year old sniper.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, by bringing attention to the fact that our Army will have to face children in the battlefield Dr. Singer may help prepare our forces and our public for the real world.	2005-02-24

In this book, Kendall Gott says it was lost in 1862 at these two battles. He certainly presents a good case. This early in the war both armies had their share of \\"peacetime\\" generals who weren't very good on the battlefield.  <br /> <br />I've never understood for instance why Nathan Bedford Forrest found it so easy to escape Fort Donelson while the other generals were so determined to surrender the fort and their men.  <br /> <br />The biggest outcome of these two battles was the rise of Grant. After this came Shiloh, Vicksberg, and the march to Appomattox. The North had found a fighting general.  <br /> <br />All in all, I don't think you can say that this is where the South lost the war. I believe that the war was lost before it started. The North had the population, the manufacturing capacity, and the moral high ground (because of slavery) that prevented England and France from coming in on the Southern side.  <br /> <br />This is a splendid history of these two battles which have been so often neglected in the general histories of the war.	2005-02-24

It presumes a reasonable grasp of basic software development concepts. A solid C and/or C++ foundation skill, a good working knowledge of Excel, and at least some experience with VBA is needed.  <br /> <br />The basic applications given in the book center around financial modelling but this represents a rather small part of the book. The concepts and techniques described in most of the book are about working to enhance and extend Excell functionality. These techniques would be aplicable to quite a number of application areas even including real time data capture and analysis.  <br /> <br />Building add-ins for Excel is an area that has not been covered very well in the literature. This book is a coherent explanation of the relevant technoloby, what steps to follow, what pitfalls to avoid, and a good reference guide.  <br /> <br />The CD-ROM includes several thousand lines of example code, numerous workbooks, and a number of complete example projects.	2005-02-24

Nearly everyone who thinks about it all realizes that the easy to find oil has been found and produced. We are at or near the world's peak production, and the direction in the future is grim. Oil supplies will never run out. We will always be able to get oil out of the ground. But less and less, at higher and higher prices. Today gasoline is about $2 a gallon and consumption has not declined. Europe tells us that at $5 a gallon, people keep driving. But what happens at $10 a gallon, or $25 or a hundred dollars. You probably don't keep a commute of 40 miles each way.  <br /> <br />What I like about this book is that its orientation is to investing in ways that will keep your portfolio protected during this coming crisis. This at least shows that he is thinking about which industries will continue to do well. He also recommends a visit to hubbertpeak.com, which contains a series of papers on oil production and life post-cheap-oil. <br /> <br />The one thing you can say for sure is that the future won't be like the past. The Leeb's way of the future may not hold up, but the problems they discuss are real. It's up to the rest of us to decide what to do.	2005-02-24

German historians blame everyone but themselves. <br /> <br />Let's face it, the countries of Europe have a history of going to war with each other just to see who gets to be the boss of more territory. In the 1800's von Bismarck was able to play off many parties to create a German nation from the city states and to gain territory from various neighbors. After his death a series of much less competent individuals tried to continue his policies. They pushed too far, the world pushed back, and somewhere around ten million people died.  <br /> <br />This book does an excellent job of analyzing the actions of the Reich Chancellor, the German Foreign Office and the Great General Staff as they bumbled along. They wanted a short and victorious war (how often this seems to be what people who start wars want). They got a war that they simply couldn't understand, and began a century of warfare.  <br /> <br />This book is an anchor that points out what these people did, not what some people would have you believe.	2005-02-23

Hitler must have really loved concrete (a quarter of a million cubic meters), and he certainly wanted a lot of alternative locations. He had some twenty headquarters actually built and more in the planning stages. All in all, some 20,000 workers were employed full time for years to provide him with these bunkers, many of which he never even visited let alone used them as working headquarters.  <br /> <br />Churchill had a secret wartime headquarters, he needed something to get away from the bombs of the Blitz. I don't believe Roosevelt even had a bomb shelter.  <br /> <br />This is a classic book. The authors had access to the reports of the two heads of the construction projects that have previously been unavailable. It fills an interesting niche in the history of the Nazi regime.	2005-02-23

The new Avian Flu has a mortality rate of 72%, that is 72 people out of a hundred who catch it die.  <br /> <br />This book brings back the story of the Spanish Flu of 1918, which killed as many as a hundred million people. That's more people killed than the plague, or of World War I and World War II put together. (Some people say only [ONLY] 30 -40 million died.  <br /> <br />The book also uses this flu to talk about the changs in medicine brought out by the flu.

It is certainly something that the conspiracy buffs will love. It says that Paul Bennewitz, an electrical physicist living in Albuquerque observed strange lights and detected radio messages from the nearby Kirkland Air Force Base. OK so far.  <br /> <br />It then says that the Government then planned and executed a deliberate disinformation program to Mr. Bennewitz. The Government program was intended to make him believe that these were extraterrestrial visitors. In fact, the book claims that the whole idea of UFO's came from the Government's furtile imagination. Further, from this start the whole UFO community got its basic set of beliefs defined for them by the Government.  <br /> <br />One point I definitely don't believe, the author says that pictures taken of a complex of buildings are made to disappear when developed. That one just doesn't ring.  <br /> <br />In spite of this problem, anyone interested in UFO's should find this book very interesting.	2005-02-23

The book says that the machine will shut down in half the time. I found that it shuts down much faster than that.  <br /> <br />It's clear that this fellow knows an awful lot about windows that I didn't know. I suspect no one is going to use all the techniques that he describes, but some of them are really helpful. His discussion of SPAM, for instance, is excellent.  <br /> <br />Unlike most of the For Dummies books, this one isn't for the absolute beginner. While his techniques are not difficult, they do presume that you have just a bit more knowledge than trying to find the on switch. This is a very helpful book.	2005-02-23

And at a price well below what the Red Hat packaged product cost.  <br /> <br />This book is, like the title says, for dummies. Not stupid just that you don't know about this particular subject. It's main intent is to get you through the installation and set up of a desktop workstation. There is a bit about using Apache to set up a web server, but neither \\"data base\\" not \\"PHP\\" are even in the index.  <br /> <br />As is common with the For Dummies books, this one includes a good bit of humor.

Here is a full fledged micro-computer controlled robot device. No, it's hardly a robot so sophisticated that it will take over the world, but it is enough to make an interesting project for a science fair, or a Daddy-Son/Daddy-Daughter project.  <br /> <br />The book and kit to build the robot come together. Everything you need (except a few simple tools and batteries) is included. The assembly is quite easy, again, good for a Daddy/Kid project. The basic design is about a dozen years old, and about 30,000 assembly kits have been distributed. Some of these are being used for some fairly serious research at several universities.  <br /> <br />Stiquito is by no means low tech. The legs move using Nitinol, an alloy actuator wire that expands and contracts, roughly emulating the operation of a muscle. The application of a controlled pulse of electricity along the wire causes heat which causes a change in the crystalline structure of the wire.  <br /> <br />You might also want to do a Google search on the word Stiquito.

As a graduate of West Point with twenty two years of active Army service Mr. Haig writes of Army practices and military weapons with a knowledge and understanding missing from most authors.  <br /> <br />In this book a LAW (Light Anti Tank Weapon), and a Bouncing Betty anti personnel mine are used to kill people in just the way that they would be used in practice. It bothers me to read about weapons that do impossible things. (I was part of the design team that created the LAW.)  <br /> <br />Of course just reading about weapons is not why you read a novel. And in this one the characters and the story are captivating. The plot is fairly simple, you have a pair of heros who have only a short time to stop the bad guys from doing dastardly things.  <br /> <br />But these are interesting characters, doing interesting things. The only real problem is that you'd better plan on a late evening or two because once hooked you won't want to put it down.  <br /> <br />This is the first Brian Haig book I've read.

When I picked up this book I was very skeptical. The title says Save a Buck and Learn a Lot. My experience is that this is at best only half true. I was just down at WalMart looking at their computer offerings. What you can get from them at around $500 is more, faster hardware than you can buy as components - not even considering the assembly effort.  <br /> <br />Then in first flipping through the book I found a section labeled Will I Save Money by Building My Own System. His answer was maybe. And I think he is right. The WalMart system for instance included a 17\\" monitor and Windows XP. I've got a bunch of monitors and don't need another, and what if I want to run Linux, why should I pay for XP. Or, I have a computer that died recently. I suspect that it's the motherboard. I could use the case, power supply, CPU of the old system and build a new one much, much cheaper than WalMart. Second, the next system I need is a web server. Having a DVD R/W and a super sound card is absolutely useless. This machine's going into a closet and will sit there serving web pages, and hopefully not making any noise or recording any movies. On the other hand, it needs more memory and CPU power than the WalMart machine.  <br /> <br />The second part of the title says Learn a Lot. And here he is absolutely correct. Following his instructions to build a PC, perhaps from an old one that you might get at the thrift store, you can put into it just exactly what you need. And if it ever breaks, you won't hesitate tearing into it to fix or upgrade it.  <br /> <br />This is a good book to take the mystery out of building a PC.	2005-02-23

Some have been brilliant, some less honest than others, but in the end most have been honorable people.  <br /> <br />They have been responsible for setting the direction of the country in times of war, depression, and good times.  <br /> <br />In this collection of essays a short chapter covers each of the forty three men. Each written by an authority on that particular era, on that particular man. They cover:  <br /> <br />the major events that occurred during each president's term in office,  <br />election results for each cycle by popular and electoral votes,  <br />complete text of every inaugural address,  <br />memorable quotes illustrating the president's image while in office,  <br />outstanding accomplishments and contributions of unforgettable first ladies.  <br /> <br />The book formed the basis of the series of shows created for the History channel. It's the best short summary I've ever read. <br />	2005-02-22

The light generated by some people's lives simply shine brighter than those of ordinary people. Tim Richmond was one of those. And perhaps because it burned so brightly it didn't burn very long.  <br /> <br />Tim Richmond was, of course, a race car driver, but what a driver. He started late, at age 21. He raced hard, he partied hard, born in '55, he died in '89 one of the early casualties of AIDS.  <br /> <br />This is the story of a race car driver. But it's also the story of the rise of MASCAR. In the late '80's NASCAR was just getting started on it's meteoric rise to popularity. The people who were going to take NASCAR to the heights were in place: Bill France, Kyle Petty, Dale Earnhardt. They, with Richmond were poised on the big time. Richmond didn't make. He could have, but....	2005-02-22

In the days long before NASCAR was the most popular sport in the country there was still racing.  <br /> <br />The early training in what was to become NASCAR was running illegal liquor during prohibition. That's how Curtis Turner got his start. And from what he learned there, combined with a natural showmanship he all but defined what NASCAR racing was all about. In his day he was bigger than any star you can name today. This is his story. From running liquor to winning millions, constantly living life close to the edge his story is an interesting one.  <br /> <br />Mr. Edelstein has carefully researched this book, talking to a large number of people who knew him personally and makes this a fascinating tale. <br />	2005-02-22

Even neglecting the religious aspects, the procedure of electing a pope is worth studing just from an organizational point of view. The Church is not a democratic institution, the election of the next pope will be made,in secret, by the College of Cardinals.  <br /> <br />Here is the history, the procedure, a handicapping of what are considered to be the leading candidates, and a great amount of detail about the organization of the Church.  <br /> <br />It seems like this book is very timely. As I write this, the Pope is in the hospital, and at his age every illness has to be considered serious. It seems likely that before too long the machinery to elect a new pope will be put into use. <br />	2005-02-22

And in my life high school was just about the worst (well there was being in the Army later on, but that's another story). There's such a desparate urge to fit in, and if you transfer into the school from another town there are all these cliques to which you do not belong.  <br /> <br />There have been several well known books of this genre, but most of them come from the male side. This one takes a naive young lady, invited to an exclusive prep school by a scholarship. She is suddenly with people where money is not a problem. But this is only the tip of the iceberg as she finds they have many of the same problems sexually, socially -- basically with growing up. It's a delightful story, well told.  <br /> <br />It tells you a lot about the author to know she was voted:  <br /> <br />the most likely to become a nun,  <br />the most sarcastic, and  <br />runner up for most sincere. Sounds like high school.	2005-02-22

And this is a tale of not only learning, but excelling in an environment where most of us want to drive through quickly with the doors locked.  <br /> <br />This is a story about basketball. But more than that, it is a story of depressed urban areas with all the usual problems of race, drugs, poverty, and all the other problems. At the same time it is a story of hope and fulfillment. It's also the story of extraordinary people who are willing to spend their careers helping the people in such an area to get ahead.  <br /> <br />More than just a basketball story, this is a story of a small brick schoolhouse run by Felician nuns always at the edge of bankruptcy but somehow able to barely survive but to continue to turn out educated kids.	2005-02-21

This way he can create characters that reflect the characteristics of patients Dr. Yalom treated during his many years of practice.  <br /> <br />The title comes from the nineteenth century German philosopher whose great influence on Freud has gone largely unacknowledged. The author weaves the story of Schopenhauer into the story in a way that creates a psychobiography of Schopenhauer while telling a compelling story of life and death, about the intertwined traditions of psychology and philosophy and about the intellectual and emotion through a line from the past to ourselves.  <br /> <br />All that sounds complex, so complex that you'd think the story would get dull. But this is not Dr. Yalom's first novel, he is able to twist the stories together in a way that they support each other to make a delightful read.	2005-02-21

So even though the Army has had a number of aircraft that would have been suitable for arming they were prohibited.  <br /> <br />This has caused considerable friction, as the Air Force has concentrated its efforts on the strategic aspects with concentrations on long range nuclear armed forces at the expense of the tactical ground support that the Army needs. The Army countered with arming its helicopters because they hadn't been considered in the original agreement.  <br /> <br />The Air Force likewise has traditionally not supported drone aircraft. After all, the way for promotions in the Air Force is to fly planes in combat situations.  <br /> <br />The realities of the situation in Afghanistan has forced some changes in these areas. For the first time there was a wide use of drone observation craft. On occassion these drones found targets that U.S. forces wanted to attack, but by the time a piloted aircraft could arrive to make the attack, the target was gone. Over opposition permission was given to hang some smart weapons on the drones. They were extremely successful.  <br /> <br />This book does an excellent job of describing the development of drones since the 1940's. He reports on these early attempts at creating armed drones. He further gives a good introduction on the new craft that are under development. <br />	2005-02-20

You need gasoline and you find a station based on location or price or perhaps a brand name. But other sales are much more complex. When you are selling a product that doesn't yet exist, Boeing's next airplane perhaps, or Intel's next computer chip the task is much more difficult. You have to sell yourself, you have to sell your company's history, and the buyer has to make a decision based on other factors such as past experience with the company.  <br /> <br />The problems come when the seller presents a value proposition, and the customer buys, that the resulting solution cannot deliver.  <br /> <br />This book continues the story begun by the author in his best seller, Mastering the Complex Sale. It could well be titled, Delivering the Promise Made in the Complex Sale. The book is filed with stories from the real world where complex sales have paid off for both the seller and buyer.  <br /> <br />Well written and informative. <br />	2005-02-20

The Bible of the Army at that time was FM 22-100.  <br /> <br />In this book he takes the message of FM 22-100 and converts it to being a leader in the Christian world. As a strong evangelical Christian, the author takes the point of view that the Christian forces in the world need leadership and that such leadership can be tought using the principles of 22-100. As the Army has discovered, leadership can be learned, and produced the manual to teach what the combat leader needs to know.  <br /> <br />Excellent writing, combined with a series of stories illustrating the points in the manual make this a most interesting book. <br />	2005-02-20

This book describes what will be one critical aspect, the actions of the United States in Afghanistan during the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union up until 9/11.  <br /> <br />The history of how the Soviets tought the Islamic fundamentalists that a superpower could be defeated. The help being provided to them by the CIA in the form of money and weapons, in turn helped them to learn our own weak spots.  <br /> <br />The story of how money is raised, how insurgencies need to be organized, how we had numerous contacts within their organizations but still not enough to clearly state that 9/11 was going to happen.  <br /> <br />There is plenty here that will convince the conspiracy believers that we had plenty of warning and that the whole thing was a plot by George Bush (just like Pearl Harbour was Roosevelt's fault).  <br /> <br />This book appears to be extremely well researched, at least it reads that way, and I have no reason to believe otherwise.

The listings contain the name, a very brief description of the programs, location, contact information, and a paragraph describing the overall mission of the school. This section is broken down by state.  <br /> <br />At the beginning of the book is a listing of the program emphasis at all of the schools (about 70 pages). The emphasis is broken down into ten general categories, and an indication is made to indicate a Primary or Secondary emphasis.

Most of these are on more advanced topics, covering the design of much more complex characters, much more complex games. Instead this book is aimed at the teen who has an interest in game programming.  <br /> <br />It makes the presumption that you know at least the fundamentals of Visual Basic. What the author says is: Read the first couple of chapters. Try what the book says do, and if you're not lost you know enough. If you are lost, then go back and read one of the more introductory books on VB.  <br /> <br />The emphasis here is to use the rather high level VB programming language and get a game created. This way the teen reader is made productive almost immediately and is much less likely to lose interest. The game being programmed is a 2-D Role Playing Game involving the invasion of England by Vikings. This is significantly less complex than a 3D game, but the resulting game is still fun to play.  <br /> <br />Because of the need to know VB, this book has to be classed as intermediate level, but the game programming aspects are aimed at the beginner.	2005-02-16

They can't seem to understand that this eliminates half of the potential workforce in one step. And for many of our years we eliminated a large source of our workforce by arbitrarily holding down African-Americans.  <br /> <br />The truth is that African-Americans whatever they were called at the time played important parts in the Revolutionary War, the Civil War (10% or the Northern Army), and the Indian wars later on (the Buffalo Soldiers).  <br /> <br />This is the first book that I've seen that talks about an African-American combat unit in the First World War. It continues to astound me to see what they had to endure in the form of prejudice before they could even go over and die for their country.  <br /> <br />This is an important part of our military and cultural history that deserves wide telling.

Jennifer Haigh has to be near the top of any listing of novelists who will dominate the next few decades. After the great success (for a first novel) of Mrs. Kimble she has topped that one with Baker Towers.  <br /> <br />As with most great novels, the story is not one of excitement like a mystery depends upon, instead it is a snapshot of life in a family. It's a dysfunctional family (but aren't they all). The story is told from the view of five siblings in a hard scrabble coal town as the coal mining world disappeared in the years after World War II. It's a story of small town life, perhaps a life that never really existed, but that's what a novel is supposed to do.  <br /> <br />This book is even better than Mrs. Kimble and is a good milestone in the development of a rising author.	2005-02-16

But now there several reasons for the bad guys to attack Linux:  <br /> <br />73 (or so) of the web servers run Linux,  <br />more than that run DNS or mail, <br />these tend to be powerful boxes with big communications pipes - just what the Spammers need.  <br /> <br />As the book says it's futile to expect perfect security unless you turn off the machine, power it down, repeatedly degause its hard drive and pulverize the whole thing into dust. On the other hand, it's not too difficult to do at least a minimal amount of hardening that will dramatically increase the effort required to break into the system.  <br /> <br />This book, written by the author of the popular Paranoid Penguin column in Linux Journal covers the general rules. It gives you a broad coverage of the types of attacks you can expect and how to counter them. It does not attempt to cover the problem of the moment, because these are changing so fast that the book would be immediately out of date.  <br /> <br />System security is a constant struggle against the dark side of the force.

Dr. William Key was an ex-slave who was successful in a large number of enterprises. At one time while he was selling patent medicines he decided that having a horse as part of his sales act would help. He bought, (very cheaply because he was lame), the horse that became Beautiful Jim Key.  <br /> <br />There is no question that this horse was very bright. There is plenty of question as to just how bright, but clearly a genius in horse terms. Over time, Beautiful Jim Key became more of an attraction in his own right that the patent medicines were left out and simply admission to watch the horse perform brought in the money.  <br /> <br />No one knows how the horse did what he did, but there is suspicion the he followed minute clues from Dr. Key's posture. At any rate, Beautiful Jim Key was a very popular performer and his 'proven' intelligence led to the anti-cruelty laws for animals that followed.	2005-02-16

At present fifty percent of the cases the FBI now opens involve a computer.  <br /> <br />I have to say thought that I didn't realize how much data could be recovered from a system. Deleted files can remain on a hard drive for months, even years. Data from RAM I thought would simply disappear when the power was removed, not so.  <br /> <br />This is a book where everyone in the computer organization should read the first chapter. The subsequent chapters get too deep, too fast for the casual reader, even for the casual Unix administrator. And understanding them will make a good start on a niche within the computer business, a profession in its own right.  <br /> <br />The one thing that the book teaches is that too make your system truly secure, you must disconnect it from the network, power it down, and vaporize the hard drive and memory, and while your're at it perhaps the rest of the machine as well. And don't forget the backup disks, memory sticks or whatever.  <br /> <br />Amazing Book.	2005-02-16

It is probably the most popular loop based creation and remixing software sold.  <br /> <br />This book is intended to be both a tutorial and a reference book and it does that by spending the first couple of chapters leading you through a tutorial before moving to a more reference like format. It is intended to be a supplement to the manual that comes with the product, at once providing more basic understanding of the underlying philosophy of loop generated music.  <br /> <br />Mr. Frank, the author is a multimedia artist specializing in digital video production and scoring. He has used ACID to create music for a wide variety of customers.  <br /> <br />This is an intermediate to advanced level book, as the author says, play around with the software first, and then we'll settle down to doing some work.	2005-02-16

And then within the universe there are people and stories that hang together and make sense. (Although I suspect that if we ever do meed an alien race they will be so different from us that it exceeds any understanding.)  <br /> <br />C.J. Cherryh is one of those writers that can create a universe and make it believable. And the Foreigner series is one of the best. There have been six previous novels in the series, and you should start with the first and build up to this one. The books in the series are organized into three trilogies: Foreigner, Invader, Inheritor; then Precursor, Defender, Explorer, and now Destroyer with two additional titles to come. Fortunately, all of these titles are available from Amazon.  <br /> <br />Destroyer begins with the ship Phoenix returned to Alpha Station to find things in a mess: civil war, threats of invasion, all the sorts of things that make up a good novel. And a very good novel it is.  <br /> <br />Buy it, put it on a shelf, order the others in the series and keep in your mind that this one is waiting for you.	2005-02-15

In the case of Pearl, her mother Maria has tried to raise her child to be independent but responsible and to have what I guess you would call an East Coast Liberal view towards life.  <br /> <br />Pearl has decided to take these characteristics further, to the limit where she is willing to die, perhaps even wanting to die to make a political statement. This forces everyone involved, especially Maria and her boyhood friend Joseph to review their own lives, philosophies and actions.  <br /> <br />In this case, the particular incident is that Pearl stages a hunger strike to protest the troubles in Northern Ireland. But that is less important than the interaction between the characters as they move to a new phase in their lives: growing, perhaps; understanding, yes; with a greater vision of what life is all about, certainly.  <br /> <br />In a world of series characters, mindless television, this proves that literature is not dead. And I expect awards, perhaps a movie to come out of this book. Highly recommended.	2005-02-15

It wasn't my first flight, and probably won't be my last. But reading this book put a different twist on my thoughts. Well, not too different. His reporting is right on the money. China is different, better in some ways, worse in others.  <br /> <br />I can't imagine even thinking of doing a joint venture in China using Western money with any thought that you would ever make a profit. Buy anything you want from China, be it shoes, machine tools or computers. But a joint venture, no way. The author had an ambition to teach the Chinese about business. Are you kidding?  <br /> <br />The Chinese have been businessmen for centuries. Because of the confusing governments (for centuries) they have learned that business is best conducted through an extended family system. You can trust your brother (even if he is not too bright) more than any outsider. And if you have trouble, your mother will arbitrate between the two of you.  <br /> <br />Nepotism, no crime, it's the way of life. Accounting systems, sure we have one of those, what would you like it to say? As a people, great people - bright, hard working, well educated (go look at the enrollment at any large university). And it's the way and the light of the future.  <br /> <br />Mr. Clissold has told a great tale. I'm waiting for the next installment to see if he ever gets any money out of China.	2005-02-15

The title itself speaks of the time. Confident that God would bless the Catholic church, the Spanish Armada set out to conquer England.  <br /> <br />It appears however that better ships, better guns, better men. Then to cap it all was the weather in the English Channel. The Miracle certainly didn't happen. In fact you could view the storm as God's will pointing in another direction.  <br /> <br />This book is supurbly researched and written with a descriptive flair that makes it almost read like a novel. You know the outcome, of course, but the story is very well told.	2005-02-15

The book has a lot of pages (840), the pages are big (about 8 by 10.5 inches) and the type is small so you get a lot of data.  <br /> <br />It's basically the history of every player, every team, in every season since play began. It's not filled with chit-chat, it's filled with data, page after page of data. To be sure, each season is described in a half page or so of text to give you the overall story of what happened, but then it goes to the data.  <br /> <br />This is the 25th edition of this book. If you've bought earlier editions you know what to expect. If you're new, all I can say is that there are good reasons for a book to go through 25 editions. It is obviously putting the information that people want into their hands.	2005-02-14

These letters end in 1957 when he had just had two failed plays and the ever present critics were predicting the end of his career.  <br /> <br />The book also includes a running commentary on the letters to keep them in perspective to the actuall happenings in his life.

In digital photography these effects are created in the computer by directly manipulating the digital image. ==This book is a introductory level, step by step guide to fixing common problems found in digital photographs.

As a result, cold things like trees and water dramatically change their appearance. And the warm skin of people put out a more intense image.  <br /> <br />Again because of the heat effect, skin blemishes such as acne tend to disappear. This may offer some distinct advantages in photographing young people.

John Schaub has been a house investor, author, and speaker for over thirty years. He presents a senario of buying a house, renting it out for enough to cover its cost and maintenance, paying it off over a ten year or so period, building an investment portfolio of properties that will then provide for a good retirement income.  <br /> <br />As with a lot of things, the devil is in the details. And most of the book covers things like finding the right house, negeotiating the price, a quick look at accounting, borrowing and everything else connected with the real estate marketplace.  <br /> <br />The book is dead on. There are an awful lot of people who have made a lot of money this way. There are two or three he doesn't mention. One is buying houses at auction when they have been foreclosed, something you should investigate in your community, particularily if you live in a one commodity area that is subject to boom and bust. Another point is that most of the people I know who have build themselves this kind of business do a lot of their own maintenance. You can pay for things like cleaning and painting, but it's expensive.  <br /> <br />Investing in rental houses is a business. Like any business it's subject to working hard, making the right decisions, and having just a bit of luck. If the earthquake finds your house ....	2005-02-14

Some schools use it heavily, some treat it more as a formality. At any case, if you are planning on college, it's probably something you have to do.  <br /> <br />This book, just out with a 2005 edition is based on many years of monitoring the test. While the actual questions are copyrighted and not released, questions that are very similar to the actual tests can be made up and used for practice. In addition, comments on strategy and test taking techniques can be of great help. The ACT is a standardized test. That means it is predictable. There will be 14 questions on plane geometry. There will be ten questions on punctuation. The questions will be of a predictable format, and that format is discussed in this book. <br /> <br />There are five parts to the test: English, Math, Reading, Science Reasoning, and an optional essay. This book has major parts, one each for of the test parts. Each part of the book has a description of the test, some hints and tips that have been frequently helpful in the actual testing, some study guide information, some sample questions to illustrate what they are talking about. Finally there's a CD-ROM included with the book. This has two practice tests designed to be as much like a real ACT as possible, except that the practice tests have the answers and an explanation of how to get that answer.  <br /> <br />It is often said that you can't practice for the ACT, that you should just go into it and do your best. This would be true if this were an intelligence test, but it isn't. It's just another standardized test. And you can certainly learn more about how to take a standardized test.	2005-02-14

And it's true that the Republicans made a concentrated effort towards attracting the right wing of the fundamentalist christian movement. Also though, reports show that 52 percent of Roman Catholics voted for Bush. This is just about the overall national average that voted for Bush.  <br /> <br />Looked at in another way, this same statistic says that 48 percent (less a few percent who voted for minority candidates) voted for Kerry. This means that the Democrats really weren't so far behind that it would be impossible to catch up. It will be interesting to see if Howard Dean, the new chairman of the Democratic party will be able to reach out to this segment of the electorate.  <br /> <br />In this book the author analyzes the impact that this religious disruption is causing and offers ways that might bring us together rather than continue down such divergent paths.	2005-02-13

If you're working on a Motorola, Sparc or any other architectured machine, go buy a different book.  <br /> <br />Having said that, within the Intel world, this book is an excellent introduction on how the IA-32 architecture has developed over time. It is a good introduction to the basic concepts of assembly language programming. It's a fairly high level book, aimed at the programmer who works in C++ or something like that who might want to optimize his code or at least understand what the compiler did to him.  <br /> <br />To go with the book, you probably want to go to the Intel web site and download the Software Developer Manuals for the processor you are using (it's about 12 meg for the Pentium 4) or you can order them on a CD. But start with this book, it provides a basis, a foundation that will make the Intel manuals a lot easier to get around.  <br /> <br />Good book to start out with assemblers.	2005-02-12

It's nice to see that everything being written about men today isn't oriented to making them look like jerks.     Mr. Miner seems to be a contrarian. In this day and time it seems that the general rule is to blame men (for everything) and to make them the (...) of any joke (just watch almost any TV show). This book, on the other hand, talks about manhood. What it means to be a man, how a man acts with dignity, restraint, and discernment. \\"And yes,\\" he says, \\"there are rules, they are based on an ancient ideal based on service to one's God, country, family, and friends.\\" Rules that are simple to understand but arduous to apply and worthy of a lifetime of struggle.     The rules of being a man do not mean that they negate or demean the increased rights that women have achieved in the world, but that the rules for men are not identical to those for women.     This is a highly enjoyable book. It relates back to the history of the age of chivalry with its three masculine archetypes - warrior, lover and monk. The book is filled with examples from the past and the present of the man our increasingly uncivilized age demands.	2005-02-11

Since reading the stories of the U-Boats and convoys in the North Atlantic in the middle of winter I've always wanted to see what it was like. <br /> <br />This book cured me of any possible thoughts I might have had about actually doing something about it.  <br /> <br />Apparently the author had some of the same ideas. Unlike me he actually did something about it. I'm glad he did, now I don't have to. I learned from him that I especially do not want to go see the North Atlantic on a fishing trawler.  <br /> <br />The book is kind of strange in its way of writing. But I think he was trying to capture the actual nature of the conversations being conducted by sleep deprived men. He couldn't write this way, he couldn't think this way normally and be the successful author he is. I think that writing like this shows a lot more talent than the normal travelogue.  <br /> <br />This is a book that will make you think strange thoughts as you look at a piece of fish on your plate. If you want a book on going strange places, this is clearly the one.	2005-02-11

Someone over 40 who isn't a conservative has no brain.\\"  <br /> <br />For 40 years Mr. Horowitz was a central player in the New Left. Applying what he had learned from his communist parents, he was convinced of the evils of the capitalist system. He was a featured author, publisher, and leading intellectual.  <br /> <br />When he was just about age 40, a lady he had persuaded to help the Black Panthers was murdered by the Panthers. The police knew it, but couldn't prove it. The media wasn't interested. The left wing refused to believe that this was anything but a smeer campaign directed against the Panthers.  <br /> <br />This book is autobiographical in nature, combined with the thoughts Mr. Horowitz was having at various stages in his life. As the title says this was a journey of a changing intellectual position.  <br /> <br />I suspect that this book will change few minds. The leftist beleivers will view him as a traitor. The rightest will view him as someone who finally woke up.  <br /> <br />As a history of the New Left movement, this is an excellent commentary on our recent history. Highly recommended. <br />	2005-02-11

It's a collection of fifty not exactly hints and tips, but nifty little ways to think about how to do things. It is specifically aimed at the C++/Java programmer that is moving over to C#, the professional programmer whose job it is to produce code that is to become part of a system. The format/philosophy of the book is to take some programming procedure or technique from the earlier languages and say stop doing it that way, here's the best way to do it in C#.  <br /> <br />C# is, of course, Microsoft's newest iteration of the language, and it is an integral part of the .NET environment. Again, you should have some experience with this environment before you begin as the concepts of .NET are referenced throughout the book.  <br /> <br />The concept of the fifty hints and tips is to provide you with an overall view that is greater than the sum of the tips. Understanding these individual points will generally improve your understanding of the concepts of the language.  <br /> <br />This is an interesting point of view to bring greater understanding about the language itself. I recommend this as your second C# book.	2005-02-11

The driver gets all the glory, the kisses of the pretty girls, the photographs holding the trophy.  <br /> <br />This book is a story of almost thirty years of being in the crew, a lot of years as the jack man. I've always thoought that the jack man had just about the hardest job of them all -- those jacks are heavy, they've got to be positioned right, and they've got to be moved fast. I guess that's a good place to start, because from there he went on to become one of the more successful crew chiefs in the business.  <br /> <br />The book is one that will delight NASCAR fans. It's the inside story of what goes on behind the scenes, it's what you have to do to win races, it's the people who were there during the time when NASCAR was moving from the small unknown side aspect of racing to the big time national sport that it is today.  <br /> <br />It is the stories of the people that make this such an enjoyable book.	2005-02-11

And here in one book is the majority of the software that you'd need to make it work. The only things missing are the operating system (Linux of course) and the mail package.  <br /> <br />The nice thing about having all this in one package is that you have a consistent form of writing from software package to package. And you have a consistent set of needs. You don't need to talk about MySQL in business applications, you only need to know how it works in a web environment.  <br /> <br />This is a programmer to programmer, beginner level book. It does not spend much time on the actual installation of the programs. I rate this as OK, because many of the Linux books (yes, you also have to have a Linux book) provide a distribution of Linux that include all of this software with instructions on how to install it. This book then picks up with comments on configuring the installation to best suit, this includes things like making PHP point to MySQL which may be lacking in the general installation instructions of the Linux book.  <br /> <br />If you are headed to working with AMP (Apache, MySQL & PHP) this is an excellent place to start. It's well written, leads you through the building of a site, and by the end of the book you are well started.	2005-02-11

Mismanagement	Sub-Title: Preventing Project Fraud And Ensuring Sarbanes-Oxley Compliance  <br /> <br />Sarbanes-Oxley is one of those things that you really wish Congress had to apply to themselves rather than just imposing it on the rest of us. It has certainly made life interesting. In terms of project management, it's intent is to ensure that a project proceeds to work on its stated mission, correctly utilizing the projects resources, and eliminate improper dealings with project vendors for personal enrichment.  <br /> <br />A key problem is to distinguish between fraud and mismanagement, conspiracy and incompetence. An interesting project discussed in the book is the California State Welfare Automation Project where the project was so confused that they still can't say if fraud ocurred. From this example the reporting procedures that may prevent the reocurrance of such situations is developed by looking as many areas where fraud can at least be expected to occur.  <br /> <br />This situation wouldn't be so critical if the law weren't written so that people can be put in jail for not instituting proper controls where proper controls are a matter of opinion. This book gives the best analysis of current thinking, subject to change of course as the courts deal with the problem.	2005-02-11

All of these get new names and a collection of devotees. AspectJ is one of the newest.  <br /> <br />I still haven't decided if I am going to actually do anything in AspectJ, but it seems to be gathering more attention. Merging it into Eclipse is certainly a big step along the way indicating both increasing support and the availability of tools that will help with a project.  <br /> <br />This book is written from a very practical sense. It starts out with getting Eclipse and the AspectJ Development Tools (AJDT). It then leads you through a tutorial to get a program running. This is, as the book says a good way to begin learning a language. You begin to see how the whole thing hangs together and hopefully a few things begin to cause you to say to yourself, 'yup, this feature would have been a help on that last project.'  <br /> <br />After that there is a more descriptive section on the fundamentals of the language itself. This is the biggest part of the book, and in good Java fashion introduces a bunch of new words to describe aspects of the language that create its uniqueness.  <br /> <br />Finally in the last part of the book, called appropriately 'Putting It All Together' the book discusses the actual process to go through to begin adopting the language. This is an often overlooked part of beginning to use a new language. This is especially true for moving the language into a project of any size, and the book does a good job of helping you define a path to adopting the language.  <br /> <br />This is not a book for beginning programmers. It assumes that you are a Java programmer, not necessarily an expert, but with some experience. On the other hand, in a fairly short while you can grasp the AspectJ language and begin thinking about it's usefulness for your project.	2005-02-10

Indeed, can you imagine a gay tough guy detective even today with all the attacks on Sponge Bob and and other stupidities.   <br /> <br />But it's true. In 1972 Joseph Hansen published the first of what would grow to twenty five novels, twelve of which featured Dave Brandstetter the openly, contentedly gay thinking man's tough guy.   <br /> <br />Dave is an insurance company investigator in charge of looking into false claims. In Fadeout, pop star Fox Olson's white convertible plunged off a narrow wooden bride and killed him. But where's the body.   <br /> <br />That's enough of the story, you can guess what happens from there. It's a good story, well written as any novel that starts a series of twelve mysteries has to be. Highly Recommended.	2005-02-10

It is completely overshadowed by the Revolutionary War fought a decade or so later. It's nice to see a book that puts this war in its proper perspective as a precursor to the Revolution. It served as a training ground for the officers (such as Washington), it established the British in Canada, it set up the French as allies of the United States in the Revolutionary War.  <br /> <br />This book is well researched and exceedingly well written. It covers the nine years and wide expanse of the war in a manner that is easily comprehendable and understandable. He relates the activities taking place in the United States to what was happening around the rest of the world where the English and French were fighting. <br />	2005-02-09

If you are using sendmail, there is no question that this is the book for you.  <br /> <br />The strange thing is, that there is so much information on spam contained in this book that I'd recommend it even if you are using some other software package. The general discussion on spam, its history, its impact on the industry and on individuals, and especially on it's techniques of spammers.  <br /> <br />I particularly enjoyed his philosophy of setting up a Bait Machine just to collect inbound spam. He then began developing techniques to stop the spam that was coming to the bait machine. Great concept.	2005-02-09

So many that it is easy to get so far bogged down in minutiae that you forget what you are trying to learn. <br /> <br />Enter Peachpit's Visual Quickstart Guide. Here is a book on Maya that is designed to get you up and being productive in the shortest possible time. That way you are producing things and can show good progress. Later on you can go further into the software to learn how to do those special things that take you further into the innerds of the thing.  <br /> <br />This book is obviously written by an expert who has spent a lot of time thinking about how to teach this software. The book has two columns on each page with the center column being almost completely illustrations - as the subject says, visual. The outside column then describes what is being done. I find it a great way to learn, you get to doing something quickly which gives you the basic concepts.	2005-02-09

In this book the same philosophy is used to introduce the use of Struts to build business applications.  <br /> <br />The general rule is for a desirable function to be defined and then there's a recipe to get that task done.  <br /> <br />One of the desirable tasks so discussed is Alternate Row Colors in a Table. They break this task down into a few standard sections:  <br /> <br />define the problem  <br />Background of why you might want this Recipe  <br />Discussion  <br />Reference  <br /> <br />This same treatment is given to a hundred or more tasks. The may not all fit your needs (yet), but this is almost a painless way to learn what the Struts do that he is using to implement the task.  <br /> <br />This is not a beginners book, you should have some idea about writing in Java, and it would be very helpful to have some background using ANT. <br />	2005-02-09

And this time it is specifically about developing applications on Java to run on Linux.  <br /> <br />What, Java is supposedly write once - run many so that it will work on just about any platform.  <br /> <br />OK, when you are developing something it often turns out that you do something specific that makes it rather tied to a particular platform. And if you are starting out on the development of a business application today, you're likely to at least think about doing it on Linux. So this book concentrates on combining Linux with Java. That way it can talk about the wide range of libraries, tools, GUIs, and other developmental assistance that really begins to tie the operating system together with the programming language.  <br /> <br />Probably some of the purists out there will complain, but this is a good place to start thinking about the application you need to write.	2005-02-09

She knows all about a half dozen languages, databases, operating systems and more. I'm sure she could write wonderful code.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately she has no concept of the retards that are going to be running the machines that put the data into the system. I suspect that she has even less understanding about the managers that are going to be using the output of the system to make real decisions. And I know that she has no concept at all about getting a project finished just in time for the specifications to change to meet new laws, new ideas, or just the way a new VP would like to see the information.  <br /> <br />One of the first things I did was give her my copy of this book. She won't understand/believe it just yet. But this will at least give her the framework to hopefully understand just what we are trying to do. The case studies in particular just might help her to understand that programming in the real world isn't a quick overnight project but an ongoing process, a journey not a destination.  <br /> <br />I have to agree with other commenters that this isn't a complete story, it's an overview, a summary, a great place to start.	2005-02-09

I read what happened to these kids, and we had our share. I still wonder how we got through while the kids in this book ran into trouble. My daughter retained her drive, ambitions, sanity. It seemingly could so easily have gone the other way.  <br /> <br />This book presents the stories of several kids who had real problems growing up. They were lucky enough to get put into a school specially set up for problem kids. The detailed stories of four kids who somehow got out of their troubles. And unfortunately some others that didn't.  <br /> <br />It's a book that makes you laugh, cry, and above all else think about your own parenting tasks. <br />	2005-02-09

Therefore I think this book is great. Specifically, or perhaps I should say superficially, this book is on the development of Blogs that are primarily concerned with current events, particularly on comments about the breaking news.  <br /> <br />Underneath the Blog, however, there's the bigger picture of the emergence of electronic communications of all type. Mr. Hewitt consentrates on blogs saying that old fashioned static web pages are a thing of the past. There are web pages, see [...] for instance that change every day, giving the latest books that are available free on the internet.  <br /> <br />This kind of communications that is possible now is something new. I think, Mr. Hewitt is right when he compares it to the development of printing by Gutenberg. (Although when I said this at the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz, Germany they didn't agree.) We are at the beginning of a basic fundamental change in how communications are made. Leaders in the area, like Mr. Hewitt are pioneering the trails that out descendents will follow.  <br /> <br />Read this book, regardless of your political persuasion, just for the information and understanding it brings of new developments in communications.	2005-02-09

It's the memories and personal recollections of a large group of people.  <br /> <br />In the Soviet Union such recollections had to match the party line from the time of the revolution (1917) until recently. That makes this a breakthrough book. The number of people old enough to remember what they were doing that year is rapidly shrinking.  <br /> <br />Mr. Bainton visited Russia several times seeking people to interview. He was successful in finding a great many people to talk to him. Most were original observers, some were telling stories that had been told to them by parents or earlier relatives.  <br /> <br />It's a very enlightening book. <br />	2005-02-08

Without such controls, the Hubble telescope doesn't point in the right direction. The spy satellites don't point at the ground and the re-entry rockets don't point you in the right direction to come home.  <br /> <br />The first Explorer and Sputnik experiences proved that what we thought we knew about the classical analysis of Newton and others were wrong, or at least incomplete. The realities of space flight intruded into the carefully developed mathematics of classical mechanics.  <br /> <br />This book reflects the lessons learned and gives a rigorous mathematical introduction to the dynamics of spacecraft control. This is an augmented reprint of the original edition published in 1986.	2005-02-08

These have been taken from the original German and specially translated for this edition.  <br /> <br />Covering such a long period of time, the development of styles of armor and the details of construction. I found the discussion on points like gauntlets, elbow protectors and the like to be more complete than anywhere else I've seen.

It's printed using two columns per page. This makes reading some of the instructions more difficult (since they are multi line) than if there was only one column.  <br /> <br />Great way to get started quickly. <br />	2005-02-08

What happens with drug shortages or if they don't work?  <br /> <br />This book is a collection of essays from a number of specialists in these areas.

But it's really much more than that. With its front end forms design capability and the integral report generating system, it is well suited for quite a number of small applications. I say small, because you aren't going to use Access to handle the operations of a Fortune 500 company.  <br /> <br />There are a lot of books that teach about the basics of Access. They however tend to talk strictly about how to do the programming portion only. They do not go into the practical aspects of database, forms, or report design.  <br /> <br />This book takes you deeply into the design of four small and rather simple applications. This way you can see what is needed to actually make an application that is really useful. It is unlikely that you'd actually run one of these applications as is, even if they were applicable to your business, you or your boss would want something changed. But with the knowledge you would get from the rest of the book, this should be a doable task.  <br /> <br />There is one combined plus and minus about this book. The plus, it has an excellent introduction to SQL programming, one of the best I've ever seen. The minus is that the SQL is based on the JET engine database. Access now ships with both JET and MSDE which is a much better engine. I suspect that Microsoft will make MSDE the standard engine in the future. Even with this negative, this is an excellent book.	2005-02-08

Conceived by the CIA the project was turned over to the Air Force. It was never very popular with the Air Force. Most of the missions were actually conducted at the direction of the National Reconnaissance Office (then so black an organization that even the name was secret) but the budget for operating the plane came from the Air Force which wanted to spend the money on other projects such as the B-1B Bomber.  <br /> <br />This book gives an excellent history of the airplane from its first concept (at the request of the CIA) through it's last flight. The book also covers the several variations of the plane including the M-21 (which carried the D-21 drone), the original A-12 (single seater), the YF-12A (the fighter version), and of course the SR-71A, the main production version. It also gives a list of the final dispositions of the remaining aircraft so you can find out where to go see one.	2005-02-08

He aludes to some expenses that are real but harder to measure, things like the slow down in air travel after 9/11 that affects not only the airlines, but the rest of the travel industry from hotels to Boeing.  <br /> <br />The second point worth noting is that his solution is typical of Massachusetts Democrats, raise the taxes on the wealthy.

The reason for this is its practical aspects.  <br /> <br />First it talks about what is probably (certainly the one I use so I guess I'm prejudiced) the most CPU used in widest range of embedded applications.  <br /> <br />Second it picks one of the standard real time operating systems (ThreadX -- and includes a demo system of the RTOS on the bound in CD).  <br /> <br />The book gives a clear introduction into the goals and techniques used in embedded programming.  <br /> <br />Finally it discusses in detail a case study of the design of a typical embedded system. In fact the device they are building looks so useful that I wonder if it isn't a real product.  <br /> <br />Again, this is an excellent introduction, suitable for the engineering being assigned to a project or the manager beginning to specify one. <br />	2005-02-08

That is, it's pretty much the standard distribution. In the United States Red Hat now moving to Fedora and away from selling a box product. At the same time Novell and SUSE have teamed up which should give SUSE more mind share than it had before.  <br /> <br />At any rate, SUSE (Suz-A) was one of the very first distributions that produced a packaged product (and is still around). It comes with the YaST (Yet another Setup Tool) installation and administration program. This book is supplied with SUSE 9.1 (including YaST) on a DVD.  <br /> <br />Chapter 1 of the book starts off with selecting your language (would you believe it offers Magyar) and then goes through the various installation screens, explaining what the various options mean as you go along.  <br /> <br />This book covers just the operating system and a few programs that are very closely tied to the OS such as web, ftp, DNS and mail servers. The book does not cover such things as MySQL, just the OS. I don't consider this a problem because the amount of coverage you could give to MySQL in a chapter would be only enough to get you in trouble.

This book is a quick and easy way to learn these packages. As an Apple certified product, this is the book used in the Apple Training and Certification program. You can use it by yourself at your own pace where it's broken down into fourteen lessons.  <br /> <br />The lessons are aimed at the practical use of the packages, not some esoteric project just made up to show off the software. It starts off discussing audio. Then it moves to mnaging still images, printing still images, and finally moving images, i.e. video.  <br /> <br />From his background in the motion picture business, the author has written some very interesting pages on how to use Hollywood techniques in your own movies.  <br /> <br />This is the most complete iLife book.	2005-02-03

The news suppliers certainly make little or no attempt at going beyond the death of the day.  <br /> <br />In this book one of the insiders of the war on terror speaks. General DeLong was in on the conferences, in on the decisions, central in the formation of the Coalition of countries in Afghanistan and Iraq. He is able to separate out the daily flak and put what happened in a perspective that certainly wasn't covered in the sound bytes of the election. This is one central player's view of what really happened in a story that will be analyzed for years just like Pearl Harbour.  <br /> <br />In my opinion this is a mandatory book, required reading. <br />	2005-02-03

The advent of ever higher performance processors have all but elminimated using analog circuits to process analog signals. Both the faster CPUs, and the advent of specialized single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions have made digital signal processing much easier. Combining the new instructions with specialized software (included on the enclosed CD, including MatLab and SciLab) has completely changed the nature of signal processing.  <br /> <br />This book starts with a solid mathematical foundation before going on to more practical applications. It is not a For Dummies book, the mathematics is certainly college level.  <br />	2005-02-02

For several years the PC manufacturers have been markeing, if not media centers, at least PC's with a lot of media equipment. Now they've begun to stabailze the hardware configuration and combined them with the Media Center version of Windows XP.  <br /> <br />Media Center PC's give you almost total control of the various devices that can be attached to them. You can record video, move your CD's to a hard drive, and of course use various kinds of editing devices to create your own media by combining several sources.  <br /> <br />This book is a complete introduction to digital media and what you can do with it. <br />	2005-02-02

There are many books that take Photoshop to the \\"guru\\" level.  <br /> <br />This is, of course, a For Dummies book. It starts at the very beginning and gets you started. You'll learn how to get started and to get your digital photographs organized, repaired, and shared for print, e-mail and the web.  <br /> <br />The part I liked best is the way it shows the results of different Photoshop tools on the same picture. This made a lot more sense to me than just the names, which I suspect has some historical meaning to the pros.  <br /> <br />It's a For Dummies book. It is well written, well illustrated and not so dreadfully dull as most computer book. <br />	2005-02-02

It's the story of the successes the governments of the world have had against ben Ladin and his al Qaeda organization.  <br /> <br />The author has collected stories of incidents where governments have found and attacked the terriorists from Afghanistan to Iraq, the Philippines to Europe.  <br /> <br />The author contends that the lack of major al Qaeda acts in the United States is a result of successful actions against them. He attributes this to President Bush's determination after 9/11. He reports on a number of incidents that have not been well publized in the US press. It makes for fascinating reading, and if true says that we are indeed being poorly served by the media.  <br /> <br />For instance his Appendix D covers the connection between Al Qaeda and Iraq, reports of dozens of meetings, reported one at a time, that make up a far more compelling story than I've seen anywhere else. <br />	2005-02-02

If, of course, you are more computer minded, you might want to use the CD ROM instead. It has all of the flash cards along with the ability to shuffle the cards and to take a practice examination on your own PC.

It starts with the construction of an application using the library and quickly goes further into using all of the packages in the Lucene distribution.   <br /> <br />The book stresses that Lucene is general enough to be used in a wide selection of appplications and shows some applications beyond the standard word search. <br />	2005-02-01

It is not for the faint of heart. It is intended for advanced computer science professionals. Don't buy this if you just want to make Windows do something. This book gets deep into the internals of how the operating system works. And by \\"operating system\\" we are talking basically about the kernal itself that interacts directly with the hardware isolating the user programs from nasty things like interupts. Instead the OS defines a bunch of standardized routines that can be called by programs to get functions performed.  <br /> <br />If, on the other hand, the way the basic kernel works this is hands down the best source you'll find.  In it's almost a thousand pages it discusses theinternal architecture and the dozens of the tools that are available to allow you to peer into the system and see what is happening.  <br /> <br />This is an awesome book that covers an area almost totally ignored by any other book.	2005-02-01

Not as well known is that his theories were developed using, even made possible because of the earlier development of tensor calculus.  <br /> <br />In this book the authors finally pay tribute to the mathematics of Emmy Noether. She and Dave Hilbert worked at the University of Gottingen, Germany until as a Jew she was forced to leave Germany. At least she got to leave in time.  <br /> <br />Most of her work was on the basic fundamentals of mathematics.

In the early twentieth century a set of circumstances occurred in central Europe that allowed or perhaps caused the rise of governments in Italy and Germany and strong factions in France, England, in the Low Countries and in Eastern Europe.  <br /> <br />Fascist parties were closely allied with the conservative elements who were willing to sacrifice the rule of law for security.  <br /> <br />In these days of the Patriot Act, the move of the Christian Right into power, and the fears of the populace as a result of September 11 are leading us into a strange new future.

There the character Tal is introduced, the stage is set, he is wound up ready for revenge.  <br /> <br />In this book, the challenges Tal faces in trying to prove his loyalty to the Duke make up a good bit of the story. The tasks he is set upon are difficult and repugnant. It begs the question, what price revenge, while it makes for good reading.	2005-01-31

Perhaps it's because of the Ph.D.'s that make these books so well researched as to be quite believable.  <br /> <br />In the first book, one very simple decision - \\"we're going to move so that they have to attack us rather than us attacking them.\\" is indeed likely to have changed history. Choosing to fight at Gettysburg was, in my opinion, his one big mistake - he didn't think so at the time, but it was the turning point.  <br /> <br />Lincoln had a hard time finding a good general that was the equivalent of Lee. But after Vicksburg, he had Grant, and he knew what he had.  <br /> <br />This story, the second in the trilogy turns further from real history. After all, when you change the course of the war at Gettysburg, Lee is still in the North with an intact army while the Army of the Potomac is basically shattered, it wouldn't play out the same.  <br /> <br />I also liked the treatment of Dan Sickles. From what I've read he appears to have been just as nutty as he is treated here.	2005-01-30

Unfortunately that's the truth. What you get here is a bunch of stuff. For one thing, you get the operating system itself. And while you can download the coftware free, you'd better be prepared for a pretty long wait, at 56K about a hundred hours for the four 650 MB image disks.  <br /> <br />I say \\"introductory\\" because there are so many subsidiary packages included in the basic Linux distribution and these can be treated only superficially. For instance MySQL gets about 35 pages. This is enough to get the software up and running, and a little bit about the SQL language. But you're not going to be a power SQL programmer after just 35 pages, you've only touched the surface. And of course each other big area (Apache Web Server, Mail Server, LDAP and a whole lot of other sets of initials) has it's own set of books to expand on what's here.  <br /> <br />But you've got to start somewhere, and here's a good place.

Even I don't find it all that interesting. Then one day I was puzzled when my ISP asked why my machine was putting out millions of bytes of stuff to the point where it was bogging down their T1 line. I didn't know. We unpluged the machine from the network and it stopped sending. We plugged it back in and it wasn't sending. But the next day it was.  <br /> <br />It wasn't until we got an e-mail telling us to stop sending out copyrighted movies that we realized what had happened. It wasn't anything in my computer they wanted, it was the bandwidth. Knowing what to look for it wasn't all that hard to stop. Google quickly provided links on this problem.  <br /> <br />This book is aimed at people just like me. It gives an overall, if fairly light, view of the overall security problem. Like the other For Dummies books it has a writing style that doesn't (quite) put you to sleep. It has enough humor to enable you to get through it. It won't make you an expert, but it will point out the problem areas so that you can go deeper into those that are important to you. It's a good introduction.	2005-01-29

The abilities of the generals to organize their armies to get the most out of the equipment was as important a story as the speed, size, etc.  <br /> <br />From this it is a logical extension to make some predictions as to what armored forces will look like in the future battlefield.  <br /> <br />A very enjoyable book that looks at history in a slightly different way.	2005-01-29

The book showed up at the office, I casually picked it up and opened it to somewhere in the middle. I had a hard time getting back to work. I wound up taking the book home and would read a chapter here and there, just like reading a mystery.  <br /> <br />I've go to say that I've changed the way I view SPAM. I guess that it really isn't any more offensive than the commercial breaks on TV where you get three or five people up screaming about the tremendous deals on their cars, or furniture, or carpet cleaning.  <br /> <br />While I still may be annoyed at the clutter in my mailbox, I can at least appreciate the effort that the spammer has had to go through to get it past the filters, the firewalls, the host blacklisting and all the rest.  <br /> <br />The answer to stopping SPAM is, of course, really quite easy - if no one purchased the Viagra, body parts enlarger, home refinancing, visited the porn site, or attempted to get some of the secret fortune in Nigeria it wouldn't pay; then SPAM would stop. But apparently it does pay, and pay well enough that it's worthwhile to keep it up in spite of the efforts of people to stop you. Still, you would probably not want to tell your mother what you do for a living.  <br /> <br />Great Book, Highly Recommended.	2005-01-29

But be sure you spell it right, if you go to etheral you get to a rather strange looking sight with links to a lot of places that look like you just might want to be sure your virus protection is up to date.  <br /> <br />When you get to the Ethereal web site, you'll be offered a link to their documentation. You'll want to download it of course. Then the obvious question is why spend money for this book if the documentation is available free over the net. The answer is organization, layout, convenience and the fact that just having a different person explain things using a slightly different set of words and sentences sometimes makes things more clear. Look at it this way. If you're working on a network problem and reading both the on-line documentation and this book save you an hour of frustration you've more than paid the cost of the book.  <br /> <br />In addition, this book contains a great deal more information of the general or background type. For instance, I found the three pages describing the FBI's Carnivore (now DCS100) network analyzer to be quite interesting. This additional information also includes more help in understanding what the data Ethereal collects really means.  <br /> <br />If you're into the packet sniffing business, this is a book that belongs on your bookshelf.	2005-01-29

Initially scripting languages were not well suited for general purpose programming because they lacked too many features and/or were too inefficient. Both of these constraints have gone away. Computers are so powerful, the inefficiency doesn't matter. And the languages have gotten enough features that in many cases AppleScript works just fine as a solution to a general programming problem.  <br /> <br />It's about time for this book. Up until now the information about AppleScript has been thin. Now this tutorial has been published to explain the use of the language. I like Mr. Kochan's writing style. He starts off having you write a program. If you type it the way he says, the program has a bug in it. (Kind of like my programs.) That way, about the first thing you see is how AppleScript reports an error. With that out of the way, you can move on to learning the language.  <br /> <br />It's quite a comprehensive book, talking about things like classes of variables, there's quite a bit on string manipulation. Of course all the usual things like logic, loops, files and so on. He saves the description of AppleScript Studio until the end of the book, that way you learn more about the language itself and are ready when Studio comes in to help make the task so much easier.	2005-01-29

Basically it is a set of mathematical techniques that are used to pull a little bit of information out of a large mass of data.  <br /> <br />Much of ICA's applicability has to do with signal processing. The amount of data that a radar antenna receives, for instance, is huge with respect to the amount of data that actually reflects back from the target.  <br /> <br />Similar problems occur in many types of signal processing, i.e. brain imaging, speech processing, telecommunications and other signals. Other types of large data volume, small signal interest occurs in stock market analysis, weather prediction, various biomedical applications, etc.  <br /> <br />This overview first establishes the strategy implicit in ICA and then goes on to give the mathematical procedures and processes that are involved along with some computer programs that implement the mathematics. This is an excellent introduction to the concepts.	2005-01-29

This book, based on original research conducted by the author defines exactly this consumer, how to market to them, and how this market has changed as the Baby Boomers have evolved into this segment.

The requirements are in the form of tests that the software must pass along the development process.  <br /> <br />This procedure helps to insure that problems are found early and corrected while they are still small.  <br /> <br />This book first discusses TDD from a conceptual point of view then gives a TDD example using a realistic application. <br />	2005-01-28

It has been used in films from those of Woody Allen to \\"Something's Gotta Give,\\" and most every jazz lover and guitar fan at at least one album by Django in their collection. While he is arguably the world's most influential guitarist, the details of his life have remained a mystery.  <br /> <br />In this new book the author draws on hundreds of first person interviews with Django's family and friends. The result is a biography that is also the rich and fascinating story of the Roma people.  <br /> <br />Django's life was truly different. Born on the roadside in a gypsy cravan, his life was a battle to overcome racism and poverty. Just as his career was getting started, he was nearly incinerated in a fire that left his left hand almost paralyzed. Learning to play with only two fingers, he quickly became the toast of Europe for his gypsy-influenced jazz.  <br /> <br />Mr. Dregni has written a biography that is as reverant as it is enlightening.	2005-01-28

His main character, Mma Precious Ramotswe of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, would have grown up with these tales.  <br /> <br />In fact Mma Ramotswe has written a letter that is published in this book.

But in the advanced labs, research is advancing the capabilities of robots to get closer to what you see in the movies.  <br /> <br />Anne Foerst, a theologian and a research scientist, shares her discoveries from her days acting as an informal liaison between the Harvard Divinity School and MIT. She was struck by the similarities between the religious community as it struggled to comprehend God's will and obey divine laws, and the work of scientists struggling to understand how intelligence can be replicated and how self-aware machines can be constructed.  <br /> <br />If Western religions claim that mankind was created in the divine image, then Dr. Foerst ask what it means for humans to be continuing the process, creating a new kind of life in their own likeness. <br />	2005-01-27

The movement rose against the post-war restoration of the French colonial government in Indochina. Benefiting from particularly favorable circumstances, including a common border with China, the Viet Mihn succeeded in the unique achievement of a wartime transofmation from clandestine guerrilla movement into a powerful conventional army. The final vindication of that army was the destruction at Dien Bien Phu in the spring of 1954 which ultimately led to US involvement in Vietnam. ==The French asked for a stand up battle where their more powerful weapons, better discipline, training and tactics would demolish the enemy. They deliberately put their fortress in an area where the Viet Mihn would have to fight. The Vietnamese not only attacked, they isolated the French force and besieged it in its jungle base. Then they crushed it.  <br /> <br />Dien Bien Phu is one of the landmark battles of the last century. Its political consequences for the French and for the Americans were far more important than some of the much larger battles of World War II.  <br /> <br />This is an excellent book.

Here Picoult forces readers to think about the question: If you use one of your children to save the life of another, are you being a good mother ... or a very bad one. <br />	2005-01-22

I have periodically looked at a house and proclaimed it to be something, and been patiently corrected by people somewhat of a superior attitude telling me: \\"No, (with an implied You Fool), that's not a __________ it's a _________.\\"<br /><br />In this book Pulitzer candidate William Morgan definitively describes the fifteen house styles. Each style is presented in a short historical summary text along with a bulletid list of its distinguishing characteristics. Within each broac style, there are variations. Within Victorian, for instance he discusses stick style, queen anne, richardsonian and shingle style.<br /><br />There are about 350 houses illustrated from more than 40 states so that region-specific details can be identified. Well over 400 pages, most with multiple photographs illustrate the details of the various styles.<br /><br />Very enjoyable book.	2005-01-22

Dating from well over 2,000 years ago, it is a compilation of short sayings relating to military strategy. These sayings have seemingly been found applicable by generations of military and business leaders.<br /><br />The author holds a Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Civilizations from Harvard University. This new translation is written close to modern language so that it makes more sense to the modern American reader. It further establishes the point of view of the spiritual traditions of Taoism, the origin of psychology, science, and technology in East Asia that are the source of the insights into human nature that underlie this classic.<br /><br />The illustrations in this edition include some of the finest works of art from China, Japan, and Korea, selected from museums, galleries, and private collections in countries throughout the world.	2005-01-22

Amazon announced that on one day just before Christmas they had averaged approximaely 30 orders per second. A minute of down time on their system would then have resulted in the loss (hopefully just a delay) of about 200 orders.  <br /> <br />This book is concerned not with the basic processing elements of a system, but with the edge and core routers that connect between the external communications system and the processing elements. It describes the theory, the accepted standards, and the practical aspects of designing a system that will continue to function despite failure of hardware or software components in the system.	2005-01-21

The book is aranged to match the chronological order of the final design, survey, and installation of a project. It begins with the prerequisites of a site survey, moves on to the survey and finally covers the installation process.  <br /> <br />Of particular interest to me, because of the project I'm working on was Chapter 14 on Outdoor Bridge Deployments. Handling a small WLAN, such as across the room in a Starbucks or McDonalds is one thing. When you are going between buildings with distance, mountains and trees and periodically rain or snow in the way it is a different situation.  <br /> <br />I consider this to be a beginning level book. It covers the basic considerations and details that I needed to know as I worked on my first WLAN. After this book come more specialized books on things like securing the network.	2005-01-21

It is aimed at the student working on the third of four courses leading to the Cisco Certified Network Professional. It builds on the concepts tought at the CCNA exam and covers more advanced switching concepts. The resulting knowledge should provide you with the knowledge and skills necessary to use multilayer switching to implement campus networks using Cisco Catalyst switches, and to interface to other equipment as necessary.  <br /> <br />Besides the test, this book is also aimed at the network administrators who are responsible for implementing and troubleshooting enterprise level Cisco routers and router configurations.  <br /> <br />This is not an introductory book, it is assumed that the reader has at a minimum an understanding of the vocabulary of switching.	2005-01-21

Welcome to Quality of Service (QoS). Life used to be so simple, you went to Ma Bell and ordered just what you wanted in switched or dedicated circuits and you got a (more or les) clear channel from Point A to Point B. But then we moved to packet switching where everything being sent is broken into small packets, given a destination address and thrown out into a big communications pipe with billions of other packets, each madly striving to get to its own destination.  <br /> <br />This book starts with the early history of making some packets more equal than others (to borrow from George Orwell) so that time sensitive packets (like voice) have a priority over data for which a few tenths of a scond delay is not critical. It marches to the drumbeat that proper QoS structure in your network will provide satisfactory service to each user with the minimum outlay for bandwidth.  <br /> <br />The book has enough background and basic information to be helpful to the user, and continues as far as you want to go into the details of individual pieces of equipment. Being as the book is from Cisco Press, obviously Cisco equipment is featured, but it is general enough to be of use with older legacy equipment and that of other manufacturers. It's the most complete book I've seen on the subject.	2005-01-21

Throughout World War II, Chiang Kai Shek ruled China (at least in the eyes of the Western Powers). He sat at the conference tables with Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin. He helped define the peace terms, the shape of the world after the war. During this time he held power through a very complex time:  <br />. he was supported in power by a series of Chinese war lords,  <br />. he fought wars against both the Japanese and the Chinese Communists,  <br />. he retained the cooperation of, if not the respect of the Western Powers.  <br /> <br />After his defeat by the Communists he moved his government to Formosa and became a major player in the containment of the China he had once lead.  <br /> <br />During these years, and since, his background the struggles he had to achieve power and have been reported in western books only sparsely. Drawing extensively on original Chinese sources and accounts by contrmporaneous journalists, Mr. Fenby explores little-known international connections in Chiang's story as he unfolds a story as fascinating in its conspirtional intrigues as it is remarkable for its pwychological insights. This is the definitive English lnguage biography of the man who, despite his best intentions, helped create modern-day China.	2005-01-20

Many of these effects have been common in the movie world for many years, but in that application the shading can be done on very expensive machines and the time it takes to produce an image is not important because the resulting image is to be shown on screen rather than immediately on a display. Now, with the increasing power in the PC's in widespread use, these techniques are being brought down to the standard desktop.  <br /> <br />In this book a wide selection of authors discuss the start of the art in shading. They are, for the most part, active professionally in the graphics display business. A number of them work for ATI, the video card manufacturer, a number work for gaming companies, or for companies producing software used in gaming.  <br /> <br />This approach provides for a fast time to print, rather than one author taking a year to write the book. In this industry a year is a lifetime, well, at least a generation in the software.	2005-01-20

Sink as much as possible into an IRA or 401(k( plan, The most important part of accumulating wealth is getting a high rate of return.  <br /> <br />In this book Douglas R. Andrew presents an explosive and contrarian book that openly challenges the most basic and fundamental tenets of personal investing. Unlike any other monty guide available he explains how people can really accumulate and preserve wealth by turning conventional wisdom on its head.  <br /> <br />The approach he follows is to use debt wisely and to invest in ways that the money you have borrowed will return more than you pay to get it. In a lot of times, in a lot of economies this works quite well. In 1929 it didn't. It's well worth reading this book for the understanding that Mr. Andrew brings to financial management.

But with the higher computational capacity the bigger the tasks assigned to be computed. Note that these are not your typical business applications. The biggest computational tasks today lie in four areas: atomic energy research, weather prediction, cryptography and bioinformatics.  <br /> <br />Some of these tasks lend themselves well to being split up amongst a bunch of computers.  Cryptography, as an example lends itself well to taking a message and assigning each computer to attack the message with a different key. The processing is independent of the results from other computers attacking the message. What one computer could do eventually, 30,000 or 3 million can do just that much faster.  <br /> <br />This book is obviously on using a collection of computers, not necessarily co-located to handle such complex computing tasks. A full time practitioner writes it with collaboration from leaders in the field. <br />	2005-01-20

In many cases the author starts with a standard picture but then modifies it into something entirely different, perhaps just using Photoshop effects, perhaps combining other images into the first. An example is converting the image of a model into that of a cat like being. In other cases he starts with a blank screen and creates the entire image, in one case a spiral galaxy.  <br /> <br />In the past photography had to fight a battle to be viewed as an art form. Now that battle is being fought with computer generated imagery. This book is a cannon shot into understanding computer generated art.	2005-01-20

The authors of this book contend, however, that this time may have passed. With the ubiquitous presence of technology in organizations and the recent technology downturn, the Chief Information Officer have reached a critical breaking point.  <br /> <br />Based on exclusive research conducted by Gartner, Inc., with thousands of companies and CIOs, the book reveals exactly what CIOs must do to solidify their credibility with the executive team and bridge the chasm that currently separates business and IT strategy. Broadbent and Kitzis outline the agenda CIOs need to integrate business and IT assets in a way that moves corporate strategy forward.  <br /> <br />The authors have identified ten critical points of focus that will distinguish the new CIO leaders. Each of these is discussed so that the new CIO can be prepared to take action on each of them. <br />	2005-01-20

Of the remaining 15%, 10% goes for female issues (breast/ovarian cancer, etc.), and 5% for male problems (testicular cancer, etc.). I told her this at a subsequent party. She refused to believe me, and later I heard her telling her same theory to someone else. Oh well, she liked her story.  <br /> <br />This book is filled with such stories. This author tends to concentrate on the beliefs of the liberals, with only a few stories listing the faults of the conservative side.  <br /> <br />Then again today I read that Michael Moore's bodyguard was arrested for carrying a gun in New York. If he is so against guns as 'Columbine' would have you believe, why aren't his bodyguards following the law and going unarmed.	2005-01-20

With them came thousands of other workers, and their families. Los Alamos became the birthplace of the Atomic Age as it revolutionized modern weaponry and science.  <br /> <br />Rather than being exclusively scientific - as are a number of other books -- Inventing Los Alamos concentrates on the people. It uses the oral history point of view to create a social history of the people and the culture that developed.  <br /> <br />The book covers not only the early World War II days of developing the Atomic bomb, but also the Cold War Era, and even a short section on the work being conducted at the site now.  <br /> <br />This is a most interesting account of the side effects of the scientific work done there.	2005-01-19

Something over 20,000 pages of drawings and notes show his genius.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the most famous of his work are the Mona Lisa, the painting of the Last Supper and his sketches of inventions far in the future like flying machines. His drawings of the human body as a machine, showing the bone structure, the nerve system, cardio-vascular system remain not only beautiful drawings but accurate representations of reality.  <br /> <br />In this book, Martin Kemp, the world's leading authority on Leonardo cuts through the dense viel of legend, challenges the myths, and offers an unparalleled portrait of this extraordinary man.	2005-01-19

It is focused on producing designs that reflect many of the modern trends in web design thought. There was a time a few years back when the web sites of all the major companies used Macromedia Flash to animate, that is create movement, on their home pages. For instance, the authors report, quite accurately I think, that such animation has not proven suitable for the majority of web sites. Like Microsoft's \\"clippy\\" paper clip \\"help\\" thing that used to appear at the bottom of Word/Esce./Etc. a lot of people really don't like moving things.   <br /> <br />These authors really like mortised sites. This design philosophy uses tables within tables within tables to provide the view the authors are trying to create. The designs they give in their fifty included templates are of the mortised type. The trouble with mortised sites is that you have to receive all of the information for the site before the browser can begin drawing the tables on the screen. With todays fast processors, this is not usually a problem. But they can get dreadfully slow if you are accessing them over a slow line, especially if they include a lot of graphical images.   <br /> <br />The back of the book says this is for Beginner to Intermediate. This does not mean the Front Page level beginner. You'd best have some idea about HTML before you start this one. I'd say it's an intermediate level book, which is reflected in the wording on the back page.	2005-01-19

Driven by the knowledge that the rheumatic fever he cought at age seven was going to shorten his life dramatically, he achieved his goals of fame  as a great performer. His other goal of fame as a human being was more elusive as the sense of urgency driving his life made him neglect his wives and family.  <br /> <br />This book will serve as a tribute, an eulogy if you will of his life. It is based on interviews with such close friends and relatives as Steve Blauner - Darrin's best friend and business manager - Darin's half-brother Gary Walden, Dick Clark, Wayne Newton, Neil Sedaka, Tony Orlando and many others. Extensively researched it also details the shocking secred that Darin learned late in life - that his \\"sister\\" Nina was actually his mother and that Polly, the woman he thought was his mother, was actually his grandmother. This knowledge made him spend the last five years of his life consumed by bitterness and anger over this betrayal.  <br /> <br />This is an excellent companion to the movie, helping to explain some of the reasons he was the man he was.	2005-01-19

In its almost 1,000 pages nearly every aspect of health care coverage is discussed. The format of the book includes some 200 pages written by Professor Herslinger followed by some 72 articles written by some 93 participants in a conference she held. As you would expect, the quality of the papers vary greatly. ==There are also a few reasons to disagree with some of Professor Herslingers basic thesis. She seems to believe that health insurers would compete in a fair market place to provide care to anyone. This is simply not true. If an insurance company can pre-select to eliminate giving any coverage at all to the sicker or more risky patients, it is to their benefit. An AIDS patient, with a requirement for expensive drugs can be folded into the coverage written for a large group, but an individual policy would have to be very expensive, or simply not written at all. The coverage of such patients is covered with what I think are unrealistic assumptions. ==The book presents a series of views that are just a bit simplistic, but which are forming a part of the national debate on health care. The information is needed if only to be aware of the discussion.	2005-01-18

'Turned to page 857, this was in the section Nations of the World, Uruguay was in bold face type and underlined in the middle of the left hand column. A couple of inches from the top of the Uruguay entry it said, Capital: Montevideo. The book certainly passed the first test. ==Then I started flipping through the book. I found the Hundred Words Most Frequently Misspelled - I won't bother to mention how many of these I frequently mizzpel. ==As with any of these omnibus type books, the selection of what material to include is always a problem.

The reasons are clear: it is the most Earth-like of the other planets, it's the only one where we can get good images from the surface rather than clouds, and from Lowell's announcement of the canals of Mars it has been the subject of speculation both serious and fictional, the pictures released by the various probes, and finally President Gush's announcement on 14 January 2004, \\"We will build new ships to cary man forwart into the universe ... human missions to Mars and to worlds beyond!\\"  <br /> <br />This splendid book, is written for the popular reader, and covers everything from Lowell's work to the latest pictures from the rovers and then projects on the future planned missions and those that remain yet as dreams.  <br /> <br />This is a delightful book for anyone interested in the skys.	2005-01-18

It includes some 15,000 garden plants. Usually each plant is completely discussed, pictured, given hints on cultivation, some history, territorial range, propagation, pests and diseases, common names, and varieties.   <br /> <br />The plants are listed by their botanical names, which is probably the only way they could have done it. For instance, under Clematis, the common names Old Man's Beard, Traveler's Joy, and Virgin's Bower are given. Since Clematis has some 250 separate varieties with wildly differing flowers and sizes, the description runs about five and two thirds pages with 54 illustrations of various blooms. Dozens of varieties are discussed.   <br /> <br />There is no question that this book belongs on the desk of any serious gardener. The one complaint about it is the common name section at the back of the book is a bit week. For instance if you look up Old Man's Beard, it properly refers you to Clematis. But Carnaby, one of the varieties of Clematis it isn't listed. I can't think of any other problems. And when I put Carnaby Flower into the Google search engine, it immediately came up with Clematis-Carnaby so I rank this a minor problem.	2005-01-18

After that two additional sets of alternate perspectives age given for each proposal.  <br /> <br />The one complaint I have is that in the section on conflicts it talks only about civil war. While civil war is not minor (21 major conflicts in 2002 alone) the prospects for the future of conflict between the muslim world and the rest seem to be worthy of a category by itself, and may involve many more people than all 21 civil wars. Perhaps this is another book in its own right.	2005-01-18

It begins with a general overview of TCP/IP networking, with background information on applicable networking standards.  From there, it details the TCP/IP implementation in Linux by following a pack of data as it flows through the stack from the sending system, out the wire, and back through the input side of the stack in the receiving machine. This unique approach gives programmers an inside look at the entire process.  <br /> <br />The book is aimed at th engineers and programmers implementing dedicated or embedded systems including sockets, network interfaces, application protocols and practical considerations.  <br /> <br />The CD included with the book includes the source code developed in the book, much of which can be modified to fit many quasi-standard applications, and a considerable amount of additional technical information on Linux and the particular aspects of TCP/IP.	2005-01-17

But every military incorporates a bayonet into their latest fully automatic assault weapon and trains their soldiers in their use. In part this is incorporated into military training, I can remember the drill sergeants teaching us to scream, \\"The spirit of the bayonet is to kill.\\"  <br /> <br />In reality, I think that if you are spending your days camping out in the woods you find a knife to be invaluable. And if you have a knife, it just as well may have the capability of being attached to the end of your rifle (and a bayonet clip is one of the characteristics that define an Assault Rifle in the US). In turn, bayonets have become collectible items in themselves.   <br /> <br />In this book, Martin Brayley provides an extensive and in-depth examination of bayonets from 37 countries all around the world, over 300 bayonets in all! He starts with an early plug bayonet, hard to say what rifle it fit as it would work with any rifle of the proper caliber. Then he goes on to the ring or socket bayonets of the 1700's, and from their through the bolt actions of all militaries and on to today's latest designs. <br />	2005-01-17

Everything, every transaction, every cash register produces floods of data. The problem is that the business manager needs to have information not just data. And this information needs to come from data that is scattered literally all over the world. It resides in various types of computer systems with various formats, various operating systems, and perhaps even in various languages.  <br /> <br />Microsoft has approached this complex problem with their .NET concept. This book is on using the .NET concepts to bring this information together in a useable manner so that decisions can be made with some confidence that nothing major is being overlooked.  <br /> <br />The basic concepts discussed include web services, data mining, statistical analysis, OLAP and SOAP/XML for conveying information between dissimilar systems. The book is aimed at the beginning to intermediate level developer. By beginning, this does not mean the complete novice, but one at least some experience to understanding the programming involved. <br />	2005-01-17

It has obviously grown a lot since then, mostly beneficially, but it seems that there's always somebody or something out there intent on invading your personal cyberspace. Norton Internet Security is an arsenal of products that defends you (more or less) from smammers, pop-up artists, virus carriers, and spyware.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the programs and routines that make up Norton Internet Security require implementation, tuning, updating and constant vigilance to keep a system protected. It seems that as soon as a way to stop the intruders is found, they re do their invasive routines.  <br /> <br />There's also a short, perhaps too short section on CoolWebSearch, a site to be avoided at all costs, unless you want them to take over your browser and point it to the sites that pay them money. <br />	2005-01-17

She first went among the artificial intelligentsia when the field was fresh and new, and she asked the scientists engaged in it what they were doing and why.  She saw artificial intelligence as the scientific apotheosis of one of the most enduring, glorious, often amusing, and sometimes alarming, traditions of human culture: the endless fascination with artifacts that think.  <br /> <br />Long out of print, it became a classic, often quoted, but not often read. Now it's back and in a new edition with an extended afterword that brings the field up to date in the last quarter century, including its scientific and public faces. McCorduck shows how, from a slightly dubious fringe science, artificial intelligence has moved slowly to a central place in our everyday lives, and how it will be even more crucial as the World Wide Web moves into its next generation. <br />	2005-01-17

The basic work was begun in 1972 when the British Imperial War Museum set about the task of tracing ordinary veterans of World War I and interviewing them in detail about their experiences.  <br /> <br />It was found that the events of the war had so burned themselves into the minds of the veterans that they were reported almost as though they happened yesterday.  The recordings of these meetings with British, Canadian, French and German soldiers as well as soldiers from the British Commonwealth and civilians who quite often bore the brunt of the hostilities has grown to be the most important collection of stories from the Great War.  <br /> <br />The author, and his staff had unlimited access to the audiotapes and listened to literally hundreds of hours to create this book. <br />	2005-01-17

He met up with another young explorer in northern Mexico. Where else to go but the Darien Gap, the only place where the Pan-American Highway isn't finished.  <br /> <br />Traveling through the Gap, collecting along the way, they were just hours away from the Colombian border when they were ambushed by FARC guerillas who were to hold them hostage for the next nine months. From then on, their survival was a matter of extraordinary endurance, incredible ingenuity and not just a bit of luck.  <br /> <br />The book written by this pair is a combination of travelogue, adventure store, and surprisingly not without a bit of humor. <br />	2005-01-15

This new edition, forty years later returns more closely to her original thoughts on how the book would be.  <br /> <br />The original edition was changed somewhat by her husband, Ted Hughes who removed some poems and added others to protect some people who might have been harmed by the nature of the poems, and to better reflect some of her later work that was not included in her original thoughts.  <br /> <br />The new edition has a foreword by her daughter, Frieda Hughes who can better explain her father's actions and at the same time revert to the original thoughts of her mother. In addition, there is a facsimile of Plath's original Manuscript, complete with the editing notes she was making before she took her own life.

In contrast to the shrill, loud, emotionally loaded comments being made primarily to get attention to the commenter, here are thoughtful, reasoned essays that challenge the reader to think about and decide for himself about these charges.  <br /> <br />These books make for absolutely delightful reading.

But what if the sun isn't cooperating? Photoshop can take an ordinary photograph and make it into an outstanding picture.  <br /> <br />Photoshop has literally changed the way professional photography is done. Now half the work, perhaps more, is done at the computer. When a particular type of image is sought, the basic source picture can be modified in ways that only a short time ago were unimaginable. In this book Barry Huggins has concentrated on using lighting techniques possible with Photoshop to add highlights, shadows, heat waves, reflections, dust, fire and more to literally create an image that might be impossible to generate any other way.  <br /> <br />In each case the starting image is modified, and the detailed steps necessary are done one step at a time to produce the modified picture. Mr. Huggins shows how to do things with Photoshop that I couldn't even have imagined.  <br />	2005-01-15

A place where refugees from the Russian revolution were gathering. A place where the French, Japanese and Americans were competing for a place in Asia. The Chinese were splitting into two camps, the nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek and the communists under Mao Tse-tung getting ready for a major war.  <br /> <br />This is the background to Bartle Bull's new book where Alexander Karlov arrives as a refugee with a mission of vengeance. This is a setting not seen in many recent novels, but after writing four novels taking place in Africa, why not. It appears to be extensively researched as to the sights, sounds and even the smell of the orient (which is absolutely true). I say appears to be because he writes with a voice of authority that sounds so real. The background is great. The characters fit with fast action and enough mystery to keep you turning pages to the end. <br />	2005-01-15

In this book, the author describes each of these 69 actions from the standpoint of which ships were involved, the nature of the actions, and often some comment on the long-term results of the action.  <br /> <br />In many of these actions the Germans did surprisingly well considering:  <br />that the British alone had 275 ships and the French 106  <br />that the lack of fuel oil seriously hampered training of the German forces  <br />that the German Navy had several technical problems with torpedoes and large gun ammunition (a high percentage of duds)  <br />that the British broke the Enigma based navel messages allowing them knowledge of German positions and intentions.  <br /> <br />The German navy tended to build over complicated theoretically superior ships without a sufficient amount of experience that only long years of maritime experience can provide. One German admiral remarked after the war: We Germans knew how to build outstanding freshwater ships.  <br /> <br />This book presents a view of World War II that has long been ignored with a unique approach to explaining what happened. This is the author's first book. I hope it's not the last. I'd like to see another that expands on his conclusions chapter and the appendices. <br />	2005-01-15

He presents some thoughts on how we perceive sound and how our mind processes visual images that are different in both concept and implementation than I've seen before. They certainly seem in conflict with descriptions from other writers. I haven't studied this book enough yet to have formed opinions as to the validity of his views. Sometimes just looking at things a bit differently is enough to open other doors in your mind. At any rate, this makes a very interesting read, and may point some of us in other directions. <br />	2005-01-15

Beautiful, shapely, and it turns out driven for success. She left Germany at nineteen for the United States with the intent of making it as a model. She learned to watch others, learning what she could from their mistakes and victories. During this time she developed a few &lsquo;rules of model behavior. &rsquo; Later it occurred to her that since these rules had helped her reach her level of success that it would also be helpful to any woman who really wants to go for it in her own life, in any arena.  <br /> <br />And why not? The business sections of any book store are filled with books for men on how to achieve success in their lives. Why shouldn't there be the equivalent books for women that are oriented to female success. And if you look at it, the things she says are not all that different. For instance the first rule is You Have to Want it, Baby - This chapter is sub-titled Desire, and a chapter named Desire would not be out of place in the business section. The other chapters likewise have a close analogy to the male business books, but are definitely written from a young women's viewpoint.  <br /> <br />The resulting book is a mixture of wisdom a la Heidi, liberally illustrated with photographs of Ms. Klum on various modeling assignments. <br />	2005-01-15

By any standard &lsquo;max&rsquo; is massive. It is, of course, a graphics software package capable of the most advanced graphical images.  <br /> <br />Books on software systems have to balance between being a reference book with a structure that makes it easy to find what you seek. Or the book can be a tutorial that leads the reader along a path intended to get him using the software quickly. This book draws an interesting balance between the two. There is basically a reference book structure, but imposed within it are numerous tutorials on building particular images. This approach works well for me, when I'm looking for something specific, lighting for instance, I can find it. Or, if it's a brand new subject the tutorials lead through getting started to produce something useful. Then the reference like descriptions lead on to the more specific details needed for the particular project.  <br /> <br />This is the fourth edition of this book. This has given the author time to work out the details the way he wants them, to take into account comments made on the previous editions requesting more information about specific points, and of course to completely cover the new features in &lsquo;max 6&rsquo;. <br />	2005-01-15

Like the others in the series it is a whole book describing one ship of the class in great detail.  <br /> <br />HMS Victorious was one of a class of six carriers built by the British in the late 1930's. They were built in compliance with the Washington treaty of 1921 so were limited to 23,000 tons. Compared with American carriers of the time, the Victorious had an armored flight deck. This proved of considerable value when the ship was hit by Kamikaze planes while operating with the US 5th Fleet in the Pacific.  <br /> <br />This book is largely a series of professional drawing of the ship (122 pages), combined with photographs (15 pages). In addition there is a narrative description of the construction, modifications, and action life of the ship which served for more than 30 years and went through numerous refits as the planes became heavier and faster. <br />	2005-01-15

This is more-or-less Red Hat version 11, and this book contain the complete release of the operating system, the windowing system, the Open Office integrated application package and all the rest of a complete Linux system. The book is distributed on DVD format disks. If you don't have a DVD drive, you can order the same software on standard CD-ROMs for an extra cost of $13.50, which is just about the cost of producing and shipping them.  <br /> <br />As with the other &lsquo;For Dummies&rsquo; books, this is an introductory book aimed to get him up and productive as quickly as possible. This book is in tutorial, do this, and then do that, format. I find it easy to use, easy to understand and I particularly like the light tone of the writing style. Computer books don't have to be written with a goal of being deadly dull. <br />	2005-01-15

To get a feeling of the Coast Guard it's worth a visit to the maritime museum at Astoria, Oregon, near the mouth of the Columbia River. The museum has several displays of the Coast Guard activities in that area, which is known for some of the roughest water anywhere. There you learn of the 'coasties' who have died on the Columbia Bar as they lived up to the motto 'You Have to go Out.'   <br /> <br />To get a feeling for these people go do a search for the web site of the National Motor Lifeboat School. They show a movie of what the bar is like on a good day. And these people go out about 400 times a year to aid a stricken vessel.  <br /> <br />This book is a history of the Coast Guard, but it's also a tribute to the men and women who have served in the Coast Guard since its founding in 1790. It's a huge book, profusely illustrated, well written and shows the Coast Guard as an example of the best our Government can do.	2004-12-15

I first got an understanding of what it meant at the Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield. In walking down from the top of the mountain was a display of a shallow pit in the ground where a picket would have lay down looking for an attack. I don't know which side occupied this particular pit, in retrospect of course, it was an American soldier. Hunkering down in this pit, probably scared to death, this man was effectively saying, \\"This is my piece of ground, and you gotta go through me to get it.\\"   <br /> <br />You need ships, and airplanes, and tanks, and the big guns, but when it comes down to it, it's the single man with his boots on the ground that makes the difference. And it continues today in places all around the world.   <br /> <br />This is a huge book, 3 and a half inches thick, about ten by 13 inches in size. It is profusely illustrated and discusses almost every battle in which the U.S. Army has been involved. It starts in the 1600's, with the formation of militia formed by the colonies for protection from Indian raids. It continues through every war, almost every battle until the finding of Saddam in Iraq. It's authors are all either Army officers or professional historians with a heavy Army history. It's a supurb book.	2004-12-15

The Standard Widget Toolkit otherwise known as SWT is a library of tools that can be combined to facilitate the programming of Graphical User Interfaces. As such, SWT/JFace is considered by some to be the follow-on to Swing which was the original Sun library for programming GUI's. Others consider that SWT/JFace violates the basic carved in stone commandment about platform independence. SWT/JFace has been tightly integrated into the Eclipse 3.0 integrated development environment, and has become the most popular Java toolset (as voted by Java developers).  <br /> <br />The book introduces the SWT/JFace toolsets as simply but thoroughly as possible. It combines both the high-level theory and the low-level details of the tools. The assumption made in this book is that the reader has some experience with Swing. I'd rank this as an intermediate to advanced level book. One very nice thing is the eBook edition and the ask the author capabilities that the publisher has put on their web site.  <br /> <br />Someday someone needs to put together a Guide to Java that just contains the names and descriptions of all the Java components, add ons and hanger ons, libraries, tools and whatever. It would also have a dictionary that covered all the funny definitions that the Java community has given to common English words like class, parent/child, beans etc.	2004-12-14

There's a phrase in the product description that goes, \\"the most barbarous and chaotic display of civil war and genocide in the past decade.\\" Note that this is restricted to just the past decade. Tragic as it is, this is just one incident. There was ethnic clensing in what was Yugoslovia, Saddam Hussein using nerve gas on the Kurds, who can forget the mounds of skulls in Cambodia. Of course to really get big time, you need to be organized and professional like the Germans in World War II.  <br /> <br />Looking to the future, what do those people who would have us pull out of Iraq think would happen between the Shiite and Sunni and Kurds that remain. What will happen as weapons of mass destruction become available -- yes, I know Iraq didn't have any. I could build some, and my chemistry is out of date. The organization that pulled off 9/11 has the resources and obviously the will to fund the development of them.  <br /> <br />Then there's AIDS. 3.1 million people died of AIDS in 2001, that's the same rate of death as in Rwanda but over the whole year and continuing year after year. Are Robert Mugabe (Zimbabwe), Thabo Mbeki (South Africa) and other African leaders any worse than the devil in Rwanda. They know what they are doing, they just don't seem to care.	2004-12-14

Looking at the Mac, which talks about the Mac in general from an overview of the operating system to storage systems and printing.  <br />. Getting Productive which walks about common business and personal applications like word processing, databases and spreadsheets.  <br />. Getting Creative, all about graphics, web design and HTML, after all, the Mac is reknown for its capabilities in the graphical area.  <br />. Extending your Reach, reaching out for the internet, for networks and even working with Windows machines. This part also has a chapter 'Switching to the Mac from Windows.'  <br /> <br />In a bit over a thousand pages the authors have room to cover nearly every aspect of working with a Mac. This book covers the standard everyday tasks that you're likely to do on a Mac. From here, of course you can go on to more specialized programs if that's where your job lies. For instance in the graphics area, iPhoto, which is supplied with all new Macs is covered. But if you're a graphics professional you probably want some more professional. And the book talks about the professional level packages such as Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop, ACD Systems Canvas, Macromedia FreeHand, Corel Painter, and others. It doesn't cover these in detail, but at least talks enough about them to get you started on deciding which is best for your needs.  <br /> <br />This book is, as the title says, the Bible of the Mac. It doesn't contain everything there is to know about the Mac (if it did you couldn't lift it) but it certainly contains enough to get you well started.	2004-12-14

As the author says on her web site: \\"I decided to cut loose and have some fun with my second book. The result is the lively true tale of long odds and underdogs, Electric Dreams. In these times when there seems to be a bottomless supply of overwhelmingly depressing and discouraging news from every quarter, I thought we could use a good, inspiring read to remind us that we all have the power to help change the world.\\"  <br /> <br />When a school from the backwoods of nowhere can put together a team of kids, teachers, and the community to win an electric car competition, it's not major news- nobody is bleeding, it won't make the television. But it just might make these kids turn out a lot better than they would otherwise. And it just might give all of the readers a good feeling in the bottom of the stomach.  <br /> <br />This is a simple little book, you already know the story, but it's written with a flair that makes it read like a mystery novel. You know those kids are going to win, but Ms. Kettlewell makes you feel every little victory, every little mishap. Brilliant book. <br /> <br />There is one little point there at the end. \\"Why can a bunch of high-school students manage what the big car companies insist can't be done?\\" As the last words in the book say, \\"It don't make sense.\\"	2004-12-14

About that time mortality in the forms of parents growing old and passing on. The bloom of first love is long past and the spectre of divorce court may have appeared. Somewhere around this time you begin to realize that your brother is about the only family you have left.  <br /> <br />Nicholas and Micah Sparks set off on a vacation together that took them to several exotic places around the world. Outwardly this is a trip of a lifetime to these wonderful place. But inwardly the trip may have even more exotic. This is a time for two men to bond together, laying aside the childhood differences from their growing up years and preparing them for the years yet to come.  <br /> <br />I've been there with my brother, but certainly don't have the literary skills to make a record like the one here. The best I can do is to send my copy of the book to my brother.	2004-12-14

As stated from the title, this is a highly illustrated book that uses tons of screen shots to get you started using a software package.  <br /> <br />In this case the package is iPhoto and it's written by a master writer. Because of the large number of illustrations in the book, it is very fast to go through. (My only problem is when I click on something wrong, my screens don't look like his, and then have to backtrack and find my error.) The easy visual approach works well for me.  <br /> <br />If you're a beginner to iPhoto, this book will help you get it up and doing what you want in a very short time. The next step is to do more, say up to the intermediate level, and all that takes is that you go further into the book.  <br /> <br />The other surprising thing about this book is the way it's organized. Most tutorial books are just that. You follow the tutorial through and then go do things. These books are then useless as a reference book. This one is different. Each task, almost each page, is organized with a headline of what you're going to do on that page. Then the index has an entry that points to the right page. For instance if you're going through the book there's a chapter on Sharing Photos. There's a page on Printing Greeting Cards. Learning about sharing photos will send you through the page on Printing Greeting Cards. But if you forget that, going to the index will give you an entry on Printing Greeting Cards that will send you to that page which is complete enough to enable you to get the greeting cards without having to go through the whole chapter.  <br /> <br />His approach works for me.	2004-12-14

All the campaigning is to get 11% of the remaining 20%. When George's daddy was president he had done enough \\"non-Christian\\" \\"non-right wing\\" things that his 40% base was by no means certain. As a result he had to spend time and money solidifying his base rather than going after the center. Clinton's base was solid and he could go after the center. He did and he won.  <br /> <br />Along about then George 2 decided that whatever he did he was going into the second election with a solid base. As a result, yes, he pandered to the \\"Christian right.\\" Yes, I wouldn't doubt that millions have been spent to promote sexual abstinence and marriage (and not for gay  marriage). But is this any different than the $2.8 Billion that the congress took out of the operations and maintenance budget for their pork barrel projects (while the shortage of armor for Humvees is making the headlines today)? Needless to say, George's plan worked.  <br /> <br />Ms. Kaplan has done a great job with this book. It is well researched, well documented.

No you don't have to be big. You can find small suppliers of specialty items that are not imported into the US and bring them in.  <br /> <br />Under selling venues: &#60;BR&#62;don't forget Affiliate programs from companies like Amazon.

It seems to me that you have three points to consider:  <br /> <br />One. Ambassador's views of the whole situation and his version of the \\"truth.\\" It is impossible, even theoretically to prove a negative. Ambassador visited Africa and \\"found no evidence to support the rumored uranium deal.\\" 'No evidence' is a long way from proving that it didn't happen. Is it possible that his feelings towards the administration, his support and admiration for Al Gore influenced his opinions? I don't know.  <br /> <br />Two. President Bush's view of the whole situation and his version of the \\"truth.\\" When Ambassador went public with his announcement in the paper, he had to know that his time in the administration was over. A president, any president couldn't stand to have such people around. The administration must speak with one voice in so far as possible, otherwise the media, the congress, the public will tear them apart.  <br /> <br />Three. The possibility that a crime was committed in the 'outing' of his wife at the CIA. This one really opens up several questions. Is it a crime? Even this book says that this was a 'potentially criminal act.' I've got say that I don't know. I'd also wonder just how secret was her involvement with the CIA. If you go to the CIA web site (cia.gov) the names of a lot of people are listed, everyone who cares can certainly find out these names. I've been to parties where people were introduced as working for the CIA. Is her outing going to cause harm to her, to her family, to the CIA, to the country? Did all the bad guys know she was CIA and this exposure did nothing? I have no idea.  <br /> <br />This whole situation is one for the historians to study and write about in the years to come. It will be interesting to see how it all shakes out when the Bush bashing has faded into memory.	2004-12-14

It's part tutorial, part reference book, and 30% on line, not printed on dead trees. The book is designed to lead you through the maze of learning the material while allowing you to discover for yourself by exploring. It is also designed to allow the reader who needs to know some little point to get in, find that point, and go back to work on the real life project.  <br /> <br />Using tutorials are the best tay to get a person up and running on a software package. You kind of blindly follow the instructions from page to page and at the end you've accomplished a few tasks that give you the introduction you need to really start learning. ==After finishing the tutorial you need a reference book that is organized so that you can rapidly find what you need for a specific task.  <br /> <br />First the book starts with a general introduction to Faces. It shows the screen from IBM's WebSphere Application Developer, Oracle's JDeveloper, and Sun's Java Studio Creator, that's all the big IDE's and a good introduction to the kinds of support that you can find for Faces out in the real world.  <br /> <br />It then goes on to the mandatory \\"Hello World\\" application (it presumes here that you have some experience with Java and JSP) just to get your feet a bit damp, not wet yet, but damp. After a few chapters about the architecture and standard components of Faces, the real tutorial begins with an application called ProjectTrack. Here your feet get really, really wet with web pages that combine CSS, JavaScript and of course Faces.  <br /> <br />This concept of how to do a book really worked well for me.	2004-12-14

If you could say that there is a central theme, it would have to be forgiveness. <br /> <br />To move along through life with happiness and fullfillness you have to forgive. Forgive those who have wronged you, rather you have been wronged in fact or just in your own thoughts. If you dwell on the problems created by others you cannot move on to even your own peace of mind. Beyond forgiveness, you also need to forget, you don't have time or energy to waste even thinking about those past issues.  <br /> <br />This book is based on the visits of a couple of ascendent beings that visited the author over a period of nine years and talked with him on a wide variety of issues including Illusions, Past Lives, Religion, Sex, Politics, and of course the Miracles of Forgiveness. These discussions, in many cases provide a great deal of insight into the world as it exhists today. Very helpful.	2004-12-13

Breaking the German and Japanese codes during World War II would have been meaningless if that information wasn't used to sink the submarines, divert the convoy, or be ready at Midway.  <br /> <br />The situation hasn't changed, but the integral capabilities of the Oracle database itself have. As security has gotten ever more important, the steps you need to take get every more complex. At the same time, the users of your data can't be expected to agree, they have a job to do and if security systems prevent them from doing their job they will find ways to bypass or ignore the security system.  <br /> <br />This book can be read on two levels. First it is an excellent primer on security in general. Second it is Oracle centric so that anyone responsible for security on an Oracle based system need go no further.  <br /> <br />Note that the Foreward is by David Carey, former Executive Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. It is generally believed that a big contract from the CIA was Oracle's first major success. The implication is that the CIA worked with Oracle to develop the security system discussed here.

Better yet, because this is not tied to one single software package.  <br /> <br />What's missing is that in real life it works the other way. You or your boss determines what is needed and then it's up to you go produce the effect. What software is best for that task? How does it fit in with the rest of the production?

As such he understands the process better than most. And this book really concentrates on the process itself, not the nuts and bolts of how to use this particular software package to make an explosion or whatever is needed.  <br /> <br />Along with his comments he presents several interviews with senior people who are in charge of creating the special effects in, mostly, movies; but also some other fields.	2004-12-13

Throwing more CPU's, more memory at the problem may be the easiest answer, after all it's the company's money. But it isn't likely to help for very long. The problems in the database will not go away by themselves. The growth of the database, the number of users or whatever will soon catch up with you. Or, for a whole lot less money, you can buy this book.  <br /> <br />This book is basically on the performance features that have been incorporated into Oracle 10g that can help identify the problem areas. Using these features, the database will tell you where it's spending its time. This is not a book that will tell you how to optimize a SQL statement. But if you know that Oracle is spending more of its time on this statement, then you at least know where to start looking -- maybe it's something in the statement, perhaps changing the index will help (it often will) but at least you know where to start looking.  <br /> <br />There's a simple conclusion to reviewing this book. If you're going to be responsible for running a big Oracle system, buy it.	2004-12-13

The title says it all. Well there's one additional tidbit of information that's important, there are 1200 pages in this book. In 1200 pages you can include a lot of things. You can include 300 pages on SQL for instance. And some of the new subjects like the new sections on The Grid (that's the g in 10g) are covered here for the first time.  <br /> <br />The Grid is coming, as of yet it's just getting started, but in the next edition of this book it'll be a hundred pages, if it isn't a whole book in itself.  <br /> <br />As an Oracle professional, at almost any level from developing an application, to tuning the performance, to security, to 'simple' things like installation, this is the one book you need to have on your desk ready for immediate use.  <br /> <br />After this, it's kind of hard to say much about this book. You may want individual books on tuning or security or whatever if that is your primarily responsibility, but here in one volume is the basic for the whole thing.	2004-12-13

There is a definite limit as to what you can do by yourself. This may be from the sheer magnitude of the task at hand, or it may be from a lack of skills. None of us can do everything it takes a team to have a sports team, to run a business, to have a church.  <br /> <br />This slim little book is about getting others involved and moving along the way you want them to go. And if you really want the brief version, the checklist in Appendix A pretty well summarizes up the whole thing.  <br /> <br />Bismark, I believe, said that people want to be led and it's the same in business or in starting a community theater. It takes someone with the idea, and the willingness to stick to it through the end, and the people skills to make it happen.  <br /> <br />Here in this little book is the condensed wisdom of people who have made things happen. It's an easy fast read, and it should be read before you start something.	2004-12-13

This book is billed as a self teaching guide to understanding databases. That's true. It is also billed as a good place for the beginner to start. I don't find that to be as true as the other.  <br /> <br />Specifically, I think this authors approach to teaching SQL is very well done, quite possibly the best I've seen. The overwhelming percentage of books for beginners, and particularly for Microsoft Access users never mention SQL at all.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, the first chapter starts off talking about the 'Properties of a Database' including the Physical Layer, the Logical Layer, the External Layer. Then, still in the first chapter, there's hierarchical models, network models, relational models, object-oriented models, and object-relational models. This is chapter one and at the end of the chapter he says: \\"The remainder of this book will focus on the relational model....\\" Why bother going through all this mess just to be told that we aren't going to use them in the rest of the book. He promised, well the marketing people promised, on the back cover: \\"No unnecessary technical jargon.\\" In my mind 'hierarchical models' is unnecessary technical jargon.  <br /> <br />I guess that what I'm saying is that this book is not a beginners book, it is more suited for an intermediate user. For an intermediate user, ready to go beyond Microsoft Access's Query By Example (QBE), then I rate the book highly.	2004-12-13

Mike Lynch is an advanced amateur astronomer, but more than that he is a radio personality and writer of a weekly astronomy column for the St. Paul Pioneer Press, these writing/communications skills have enabled him to write this gorgeous book on astronomy for amateurs. In recent years the advances in astronomy have given to us a most amazing set of pictures. Some come from the Hubble orbiting observatory, some from new huge ground based telescopes. These images have been digitally enhanced and colorized to provide images that only a few years ago were simply impossible to obtain. Mr. Lynch has collected a number of these to illustrate the points he is discussing.  <br /> <br />This book is a general introduction to every aspect of astronomy from the thinking of the ancients making up stories about the constellations, to the recent research on the planets such as photographs of the surface of Mars taken from probes actually on the surface.  <br /> <br />Oh that Galileo could see this book. Remember that he was put under house arrest for suggesting that moons went around Jupiter rather than everything in the heavens going around Earth and we humans.  <br /> <br />This is a delightful coffee table book. And it isn't just for Minnesota. The universe doesn't revolve around Minnesota any more than it does Earth.	2004-12-13

The physical theory said that this could be done and the mechanical assembly of semiconductors using the epitaxial growth of planar structures which enabled monolayer thickness made the devices practical. Enhancement of the techniques since has driven down the price of components dramatically downward (the low price of CD-ROM readers and players is the result). While the thickness of the layers has been easy to control, the other two dimensions has proven much more difficult.     In the past few years, new techniques have come into being that offer great promise in the fabrication of devices that are not planer (two dimensional) but linear (one dimensional - a wire) or even a single dot (of almost no dimension).     This book, edited by Dr. Glenn Solomon of Stanford and Dr. Garnett Bryant of NIST researchers from around the world have contributed chapters that cover the state of the art in how quantum dots and wires are fabricated and applied to optics. This is as cutting-edge a book on the subject as is possible to put together today.	2004-12-13

Wow!  <br /> <br />It used to be that a database was just that, a thing that you fed data and it gave it back when you politely asked (I say politely because you had to talk its language, SQL, and you had to talk it fairly precisely or it just gave you some incomprehensible rejection notice.)  <br /> <br />Now the database has become almost a complete business environment. The Oracle Application Server contains a web server (based on Apache), a web portal, Wireless connectivity, Forms, Java 2 Enterprise Edition, all kinds of management and security routines, and more.  <br /> <br />This book is primarily a Web Development book. That is, it uses virtually all of the parts of the Oracle Application Server with a view to presenting information on the web. Probably this is because so many business applications are now being written with a view of using the web as the standard interface into the business system.  <br /> <br />Beyond that, however, this book actually covers nearly every aspect of the Application Server. The book includes things such as using Java in the Oracle Database along with the JDeveloper IDE. Many of these subjects have books written about them alone. Here in one volume is a complete introduction to just about everything you could possibly use to produce any business system needed using the Oracle system, and it's the most complete approach that I've found.	2004-12-13

That they were not put into production was a matter of political and military decision making rather than any technical issues. Neither the Army nor Hitler expected a long war with the need to bomb the Russian factories beyond the Ural mountains or of course England. Planes like the Dornier Do 19, the Junkers Ju 89 and 290, and of course the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor were produced and flying before the war.  <br /> <br />This book is mostly drawing of planes that never made it past the design phase. But in these drawings you can clearly see the equivalents of B-29's even the later B-36 (Except that it appears that almost everything the Germans did had two tail fins.). There are several flying wing designs that were being done just about the same time as the Northrup B-35 Flying Wing. The Messerschmitt ME P.08 was proposed in September of 1941, the Northrup contract was awarded in November 1941. Presumably the ME P.08 wouldn't have worked any better than the B-35 because the computer controls just weren't up to it in that time frame.  <br /> <br />Of course the German Jet powered designs are very interesting as well. They had the jet engines in production and were beginning to think of the problems of layout and design for jet powered bombers. A gret fun look at what was never to be.	2004-12-12

As it says, it covers the Junkers company from 1913 to 1945. And it covers it completely. It starts with the J1 and goes to the J2, and the J3 and so on through every plane the put into production, and every prototype plane they built, and it appears just about every plane they even thought about. Of course planes like the Ju-52 (the three motored Tante Ju that was basically the C-47 of Germany), the Ju-87 Stuka, and the Ju-88 (in about a dozen versions) are given more pictures, more pages than planes that never got off the drawing board.<br /><br />In addition, Junkers also built engines (Did any other airframe manufacturer also build engines?), not the least of which were the Jumo 211 used in the ME-109, and the 109 series of turbojets used in the ME-262 and the Arado 234.<br /><br />This book is exhaustively researched. Where could they have possibly have gotten all these photographs of rare aircraft, including almost every type of plane built, a listing of every known surviving plane, even comments on what happened to the follow on designs of advanced engines that were continued by the French, Czechs, and Soviets.<br /><br />The book is beautifully printed (in Spain) on coated paper so that the photographs show up very well. This will be the hands down definitive book on the Junkers, probably for all time.	2004-12-12

I was at a coctail party at a computer show when this lady in a white Navy uniform came it. It was Grace Hopper. Someone asked her for an autograph. Admirals don't need to carry pens around, so I promptly offered her mine. And after she signed one of her business cards for him, I said that I'd like one also, so she signed another. I still have it.  <br /> <br />This all came back to me as soon as I saw this book. I picked it up, I opened it to a page where it talks about her first reporting to Howard Aiken at Harvard to work on the Mark I computer. Aiken handed her a manual and told her to write a program. Almost exactly twenty years after she was given the manual, the Army did exactly the same to me - here's a manual, here's the equasion I want solved.  <br /> <br />Even in her advanced years at the time I met her, she was still one very bright lady. This was in the very early days of the PC, and she had a basic understanding that enabled her to predict many of the things that were going to happen while the rest of were stumbling around thinking about word processing.  <br /> <br />Grace Hopper was quite a lady, and that's reflected in this book. Between 1934 and 1937 hers was the only Ph.D. in mathematics awarded to a female. It was quite a life that she led, and that too is reflected in this book. Adm. Hopper lived in a time when women didn't need to be educated, they were just going to be housewives, and they certainly weren't going to be Navy Admirals. This book is a story of one remarkable woman, but more than that it's the story of computing and of our changing times.	2004-12-12

It's a detailed discussion on the development of a real game (30,000 lines of code) by a small team of game developers.   <br /> <br />The book starts with the development of a set of requirements for the game. What's the game all about, what tools are going to be used, what is the scope of the project? Indeed, what makes a good set of requirements in the first place. From there it goes to modelling the game using UML. This step helps to visualize the system that constitutes the game. Why model, how to model? From here the next step is the basic software design. What's the structure of the program going to be? Why? ?What are alternatives? Then on to the next step and the next.  <br /> <br />This is not a description of how the play the game, this is an introductory to intermediate (maybe even advanced) book on Software Engineering. It is oriented to gaming, but it covers the basic rules of any major software project. The approach that it uses leads you through the process one step at a time, it gives you the way professional developers approach the business.	2004-12-12

At the beginning of World War II the world had pretty well settled on what fighter aircraft would look like: an engine up front (usually a V-12), a low wing, a single pilot, machine guns firing through the propeller and/or mounted in the wings. To be sure there were some that didn't look like that, the Navy wanted radial engines, the P-38's twin boom construction, the P-39 with its engine behind the pilot, but most, from all air forces met the standard.  <br /> <br />But as time went on, the tecnologies began to change. Where do you put the radar, and the changes in airframes to suit the jet engine where you had big air intakes and exhausts caused a tremendous amount of thinking about where things go.  <br /> <br />At the forefront of this thinking was the Germans. They were basically ahead of the rest of the world. They had rocket and jet engines much further into development and production than the rest. Each of the airframe manufacturers in Germany produced a number of prospective designs to present to the Government. Strangely enough, many of these designs have a very close resemblence to aircraft produced later by the Soviets, British or Americans. Once in a while the author shows photographs of the later planes with the sketches or drawings the Germans were doing.  <br /> <br />Obviously most of these aircraft were never built. You think about, sketch, discuss, and design very carefully before you commit the money to bending sheet metal. It makes you wonder where the authors found all this information.	2004-12-12

The first editions cover the first versions of the software, but things are left out and a few things are even wrong. Now Sonar is at version 4 and so is this book. Together they make quite a package.  <br /> <br />Like most manuals, the Sonar manual tells you everything that the software will do, but somewhat terseley and with little background so that you don't really know just what is possible. This book starts out saying, \\"I know you want to get started right now, but let's talk just a bit about MIDI first.\\" You wind up getting a much more complete understanding of what the whole thing is all about.  <br /> <br />Well written, complete coverage, easy to understand, what more can I say.	2004-12-12

Strangely missing is the Hellcat, but this is a minor thing.  <br /> <br />Some of the unepected aircraft include the PB4Y Privateer, the Navy's version of the B-24. Another is the Martin P6M Seamaster, the jet powered flying boat that worked quite well but got cancelled to provide money for the Polaris sub project.

And during this time Mr. cutler was semi drafted into the OSS and assigned to counter espionage. First he was working on finding people to send into Germany and subsequently stationed in Berlin he was seeking out the remains of the German spy organization and working to counter the activities of the Soviets who were also looking for the Germans with a view of turning them into Soviet agents. It was a very interesting time with a great deal of intermixing between the Russians and the Americans, before the big breaks that were to come later.  <br /> <br />In 1946, Mr. Cutler was faced with the decision to remain with the OSS, becoming the CIA, or leave. He left to join civilian life. Still he retains his interest in intelligence matters, and in the last chapter offers some comments and advice on the CIA and it's actions regarding Watergate, the Church Committee, and 9/11.

Unlike most of the other generals of the Civil War (on both sides) he did not attend West Point, he was trained in law but never practiced. When the war started, believing that the states who had voluntarily joined together could withdraw from the union if they wished, he formed the Hampton Legion. Wounded three times he was at many of the big battles of the war. These included: First Bull Run, the Peninsula Campaign, the Battle of Seven Pines, Antietam, the Chambersburg raid, and the Battle of Gettysburg. After the Battle of the Wilderness, he became commander of the cavalry corps, and took part in the Petersburg Campaign. He finished the war as a Lt. General.  <br /> <br />This book completely covers his wartime campaigns, but then goes on to cover his extensive political career after the war. Governor of South Carolina and two terms in the U.S. Senate he was finally defeated by the political machine of Ben Tillman.  <br /> <br />This book, by a fellow South Carolinian, is a welcome addition to Civil War literature.

If you agree with Dr. Malones conclusions or not, you need to at least understand them. And with some of them I agree and some I don't.     A major part of his thesis is that the dramatically lowering cost of communications will change the nature of business organizations dramatically, as dramatically say as the changes brought about by the printing press. Yes, that you are reading this on a computer means that you are part of this revolution, although the people at the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz, Germany have a different opinion. For instance, you don't know where I'm writing this, what time of day it is here, or if I'm by myself or in a large office. That's an organizational change from the way the big magazines and newspaper write book reviews.     There is another point that he doesn't mention strongly enough. That is, the every rising cost of oil will force more decentralization. Commuting the distances we do simply won't make sense. (Commuting hasn't slowed much with oil at $50 a barrel, but what would happen at $200, $500 or $1,000 a barrel). Countering this is the desire of a number of managers I've had over the years who want to see all of their employees sitting at their desks so they can see what they are doing.     Don't look at this book as a how to reorganize your company, it's more longer term, more bigger picture than that. But forewarned is forearmed, there is every indication that this is the way of the future.	2004-12-10

He explores the subject through literature, through the actors on stage, and in portraits from the time.  <br /> <br />I found particularily interesting his intrepretation of the many times in Shakespeare's plays that a woman and/or young man exchange identities.

Companies start, most fail, some have that essence of an idea that makes them become a giant in the field. Sometimes they become the instrument of change itself, as when department stores began to replace the mom and pop stores. Department stores in turn became a casualty (not quite yet perhaps) when the super specialty stores began to concentrate on prime areas of their business.  <br /> <br />Ingrained management ideas are hard to change. And most of the time the old line organizations fade away. Once in a while these old line companies are able to re-organize their operations to become a profitable, yet distinctly different company.  <br /> <br />In this book change is analyzed in terms of the effect that various types of change have on the existing players. Some are gradual, the base business remains the same, the core activities and core assets are stable. But some changes are radical. If you build buggy whips and Henry Ford comes along....	2004-12-10
428726:US	50776149	R3GTDTXPKSV3WD	1591022304	325985161	Into The Buzzsaw: LEADING JOURNALISTS EXPOSE THE MYTH OF A FREE PRESS	Books	5	10	19	N	N	As Much Between the Lines as In Them	This is a book that deserved to be widely read. I'm not so sure if that's because of what it says as reading between the lines. It's a series of articles, or essays, or maybe vignettes written by people in the media who are discussing stories that they feel were not adequately covered by the national media. They blame their own companies, the Government, nearly everyone but themselves.  <br /> <br />On the back cover it says: \\"CBS's Dan Rather describes in chilling terms how perssure to be patriotic compessed him and other journalists to censor themselves.\\" First, in the Dan Rather vignette, he doesn't use the word \\"censor\\" at all (at least not that I could find in reading it two or three times). Second, perhaps Dan Rather needs some censorship, either by himself or others, that might have prevented the little story that he reported on the Bush National Guard just before the election, and which he later defended until proven wrong.  <br /> <br />Yes, the national media covers the news rather poorly. (But better than the local news which is almost pure entertainment.) It's called ratings. Why else would so much coverage be given to some young guy in California who murdered his wife (Scott/Laci Peterson). And what about the overwhelming percentage of news stories that center around New York and Washington, D.C. -- there is life across the Hudson and outside the beltway.  <br /> <br />There's one other real critism that I have, the sub-title says, \\"the Myth of a Free Press.\\" The TV/Newspaper press isn't free, it's big business. Readers of other book reviews I've written have seen me write, \\"you don't really know the story until the books come out.\\" This book confirms this in spades. Here the book is out. It wasn't censored. There are about 70,000 book publishers in the United States. You can find one that will print the stories (and Prometheus Books is to be complimented on publishing this one and many others dealing with social issues). Book publishing is where Free Press remains.	2004-12-10

I made the rounds of the traditional tire chains in my small town. The quotes from the three stores were just about identical at $600. I went to WalMart -- $400. Same mileage guarantee, same 'we fix flats and rotate,' and a warranty that was truly nationwide. Please explain why I shouldn't have bought the tires I needed at WalMart.  <br /> <br />Category Killers are those giant specialized stores that are wiping out the competition in the areas in which they have chosed to compete. Toy-R-Us for instance has basically wiped out the KB toy chain that had before done a lot to wipe out the mom & pop toy stores. Category Killers operate in many, if not most, of the traditional specialty marketing area. You know their names PetSmart, Barnes & Noble, Home Depot, and many more. This has created a change in the way we shop, the way taxes are collected, the way producers market and position their products.  <br /> <br />Of late there is some backlash against the big stores, particularily WalMart as it's the biggest, some towns don't want them, some lawsuits have been files, the INS has raided a few stores for using illegal workers. But $600 over here, $400 over there.  <br /> <br />Category killers are what's happening in retail, to the dismay of many, and to the benefit of consumers. In this book Mr. Spector uses his background in retailing to examine the current revolution in retail -- yes, it's just the current revolution, there have been many before such as the construction of malls, and to make some predictions about the future of retail and the consumer culture.  <br /> <br />For what it's worth, I think he is dead right.	2004-12-10

But men do not live in a vacuum. They all have mothers, most have wives, some have sisters or mistresses. During the time of the founding of the United States and its breaking away from England, only a few women come to mind: Betsy Ross (who maybe did or maybe didn't make that flag), Molly Pitcher (who may or may not have served that cannon at the Battle of Monmouth), Martha Washington, Abigail Adams - who else? Ben Franklin had a child, so presumably he had a wife -- he did Deborah Read Franklin and her story is the first in this book.  <br /> <br />That's about the content of the book. Each chapter is a story about one of these women along with their interactions with their husbands, family and the other women of their society. These are, for the most part, women from the upper classes of the time. It was a time when thest women \\"fought for the foundation of this country and they made sure that the men did not allow it to fall apart.\\"  <br /> <br />As a professional journalist of many years standing, Ms. Roberts tells a wonderful, entertaining story that is long since past due.	2004-12-09

Wounded he bailed out of the stricken plane. On the ground he was incredibly lucky. He fell into the hands of The Comet Line. This was a network of people from Brussels to Spain that helped downed British and American air crew to escape. This book uses the story of Grimes to tell the story of the Comet Line itself.  <br /> <br />The Comet Line was the creation of an elegant young Belgian woman Dedee de Jongh. She ran the organization until she was captured and sent to Ravensbruck concentration camp; she survived the war.  <br /> <br />Parts of this story are seen in the movie \\"The Great Escape\\" where one of the escapees travels down the line to Spain. True, this is a dramatic story of people at their best in very dangerous situations.	2004-12-09

It was written over a period of about fifty years by J. R. R. Tolkien and really never finished. This book lays out the foundation of the world as Tolkien visualized it. It's the story of how the jewels were created, how the world worked. In this edition, it is a beautiful book, complete with 48 beautiful paints made by Ted Nasmith, many of which are included for the first time.  <br /> <br />Along with the Quenta Silmarillion itself are several short pieces that extend and expand the world. One of these is a lengthy letter written by Tolkein in which he explains his vision in his own words. Here an overview of the world as he saw it, as he wanted it published. The four short pieces Ainulindale, Valaquenta, Akallabeth and Of the Rings of Power complete the work. Here are all the rich Tolkein words that describe his dream, his world.	2004-12-09

It is clear that the colored, then negro, then black, then African American soldiers have more than earned their place in the sun. I can only hope that this book shines that light.	2004-12-09

We learn to talk by making mistakes. Babies gurgle and cry and once in a while make a word. Momma, Daddy and Grandma reward the baby and eventually he's chattering away. Silicon brains can't do that.  <br /> <br />But with the advances in computer technology, we are gaining the ability to store and process large amounts of data, as well as to access it from physically distant locations. With this mass of data, we have made progress in \\"data mining.\\" If a person buys the first Harry Potter book. there's a percentage that will buy the second, and a different percentage that will buy the third. You can mine the data for these numbers. And by analyzing these percentages you can determine the likelihood of success in directing advertising to this customer. This is just one example of machine learning. Other topics covered in this book include statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, process control.  <br /> <br />This book is intended for the beginning student in machine learning, he should have some background in programming, probability, calculus, and linear algebra. Having said that, I can recommend this book to anyone moving into the machine learning area.	2004-12-09

I look at the pictures of him using pony's to pull sledges. And his boat, the Nimrod, with her sails set; you almost want to say, \\"are you kidding.\\"  <br /> <br />There is a lot of discussion in this book about the conflict between Shackleton and Scott. It has been said that if you really wanted to get somewhere on an expedition, you should go with Scott. But if you're priority was more on getting home alive, go with Shackleton. This was, I think never so evident as in Shackleton's next voyage in the Endurance.  <br /> <br />This book focuses on the voyage of the Nimrod, as it says in the sub-title, but it is more than that. The insight Mr. Rifenburgh shown in his understanding of the people, the way he brings them to life with good story telling and his grasp of the overall view of the explorations make this book an absolute delight.	2004-12-09

Throughout the book there are little hints and tips that turn into wisdom when you think about them. You need to review it every so often because in the pressures of day to day work you find that you forget things. You read it again and all of a sudden you come up with an idea that perfectly fits that sales situation you find yourself in at the moment.  <br /> <br />It's important to remember that your customer (or prospect) and you are there to work out a mutually beneficial business relationship. If both of you don't make out well on the deal, you won't have a deal for long. The customer is buying, not to help you out, but to help himself meet his own goals, whatever they may be.  <br /> <br />I particularly liked his chapter on the Anatomy of a Buying Decision. For instance, price is important, but price is rarely the most important thing in a decision. It doesn't matter what the price is if you are selling fertilizer and the customer is looking for week killer. But if you find out that he had a weed problem, perhaps you can reach into another part of your sales bag and solve that problem. Then next week, when the weeds are dead....  <br /> <br />Another important part is that you really are selling yourself, not the product. He has to believe you when you say that your week killer will solve his problems, otherwise you're doomed.  <br /> <br />This book seems likely to become one of those classics that remain around forever. It's simply too good to go away.	2004-12-09

It was considered impossible. But he did it.  <br /> <br />Today, advances in nutrition science and technology have allowed more than 2,000 runners to finish under four minutes. Amby Burfoot, the 1968 Boston Marathon champion and Runner's World executive editor, describes the difference in athletes today as being full-time professional runners who make hundreds of thousands of dollars compared to Bannister, who was a medical student who enjoyed running.  <br /> <br />\\"Today's athletes run five to eight times as many miles a week as Bannister probably did,\\" said Burfoot. \\"They also avail themselves to a team of nutritionists, sports psychologists and exercise physiologists who analyze their breathing and muscle fiber.\\" As a result they have cut fifteen seconds off of Bannister's time.  <br /> <br />This book is not on these modern runners, it's about doing the impossible. It's the story of three people: Roger Bannister, John Landy and Wes Santee who set out to do this impossible task. Written with a great deal of access to all three men, this is a supurb book that should make all three the heros they deserve to be.	2004-12-09

And it is mostly about a time when marriages were arranged in order to accomplish affairs of state. Knowing that this is what was going to happen to you, and with the public and rest of the court also knowing, there is little surprise that royal mistresses were an accepted fact of life.     One of the many surprising points brought up in the book is how difficult it was for a mistress to keep her position. It was not an easy job as the competition was severe and numerous. Also, it appears that the relationship between King and mistress was more like a true marriage than an affair of state. Conversation, companionship are repeatedly mentioned as the important parts of the relationship, sex yes, otherwise there would not have been a chapter on Royal [...].     This book is Europe centric. There is no mention of Jack Kennedy/Marilyn Monroe, or of Bill/Monica. I'm reminded of Henry Kissenger's comment that power is the ultimate aphrodisiac. Perhaps Ms. Herman will follow this with \\"Sex with Presidents.\\"	2004-12-08

It is intended for business people who are responsible for improving their business's market position and are using software development as a key component in addressing the business goals, analysts who are responsible for creating system requirements to address the needs of the business, managers who need an understanding of what modelling can do for their projects, primarily software, but also in other areas such as database utilization, programmers who don't know UML but who must implrement the systems that are specified in UML. It is specifically not for the UML programmer who will need a more complete text to do the actual UML work.  <br /> <br />I would add that this is also a suitable book for the beginning UML programmer who can use this book as a good introduction to what UML can do. This kind of thing is often left out of the beginning of the more serious texts.  <br /> <br />This is part of the For Mere Mortals series. The intent of this series is to present information on important technology topics in an easily accessible, common-sense manner. This book meets this intent in every way. The writing style, the content, the tone is ideal. The positioning of the book in the middle of the manager and the tekkie is what is truly outstanding.	2004-12-08

It is not a book on C itself, but you could probably use it as one. It's real emphasis is on the system call, shared library, file handling level. That is, how to interface directly to the operating system itself to get it to perform what you need it to do.  <br /> <br />The bookis aimed at three audiences: C programmers who need to know how to get to the Linux operating system, Unix programmers who need to make the transition to Linux (no they're not the same), Linux programmers who need to move upwards in their understanding of the operating system. It does these jobs very well. The authors each spent years at Red Hat developing their releases, have a throrough understanding of Linux and the ability to convey that information to the reader in a clear and understandable manner.	2004-12-08

It's a position very close to the top of the American Political System (Third in line to be the President). But it's not a position on which the country votes. Instead, some state selects a Congressman, and the Congress selects its leader. And generally speaking most of us who live outside his home state have never heard of the man.  <br /> <br />Such was the case when Denny Hastert was given the position. And unlike some of his predecessors, he has not become a nationally known, or perhaps reknown is a better word, figure.  <br /> <br />In this book, he talks about how he got to where he is: sixteen years as a government and history teacher at the high school in Yorkville, Illinois. In addition he coached football and wrestling, and sometimes drove the school bus.  <br /> <br />He writes that the best training to become speaker of the house is to drive a school bus. \\"You're got to (1) keep the bus on the road, (2) keep your eye on the kids in the rear-view mirror, and (3) watch your back.\\" As he says, \\"Hearding cats.\\"  <br /> <br />The toughest job: \\"teaching sixteen-year-old kids the basics of economics\\" was his original answer, now he says: \\"Teaching economics to some Members of Congress.\\"  <br /> <br />This book reads like a novel. It's too easy to say to yourself, \\"I'll read one more page before turning out the light.\\" It leaves you with a better understanding that Congress is just people. People who have different ideas perhaps, but who have to work together to get anything done. It's quite a book.	2004-12-08

It's a beginners book in that it assumes no background in Cocoa or Objective-C. It's kind of intermediate in that having at least programming experience in some language will be of great help.  <br /> <br />The book does not start with a lot of philosophy, instead it goes through a step-by-step process to wrtie the first application. This is done with some good explanations and a lot of screen shots.  <br /> <br />The author is a teacher of Cocoa, and he wrote this book to use in his classes. After writing the firt edition he used it for a couple of years, enough to understand where the problems might lie. Now he's done a second edition based on what he learned in teaching the first book, and the changes that Apple has made in the software.  <br /> <br />This book is tutorial, not a reference book. It leads you through the process step by step. Then there is a fairly extensive index so that you can look up points later. Highly Recommended.	2004-12-08

Or in the United States we had the Crosley and the Nash Metropolitan (There's one of these for sale at Ebay as I write, $5,000.).

(That is, if the price hasn't already told you that.) Note the title: The Guro's Guide. And he means it.  <br /> <br />If you're a database developer or administrator using Microsoft SQL Server, get this book today. It would be nice to think that all the big databases met the ANSI standard and were therefore truly portable from database to database and it would be nice to have a Tooth Fairy and Easter Bunny. Instead we are left with really having to understand deeply. And this Guru knows what's going on where.  <br /> <br />There are three books in this series. I'm more into programming so I found the book on Transact-Sql to be the one that I pick up the most. It's got more stuff on T-SQL than any of the half dozen other books I have, some of which are much bigger. What that means is that the writing style doesn't waste a lot of time on excess verbage. It's tight and concise. And that means not for beginners looking for a lot of this is a database kind of stuff.  <br /> <br />But the volume that I need the most is the Guide to Architecture and Internals. I don't use it often, but when I do it is likely to be the only book available that tells me what I need to know at that moment. It's also something you might keep by your bedside. Unless I'm working on a specific problem, thirty seconds and I'm out.  <br /> <br />The third book is on Stored Procedures (just in case you want to run faster), XML and HTML.  <br /> <br />Conclusion, if you're serious about SQL Server, you can't do any better.	2004-12-08

We can't even agree on what happened in Dallas in 1963.<br /><br />Today the pressures on a textbook writer are tremendous. Be careful about what you say on communism. Be sure to pass the Texas Board of Education (abstinence is the only approved basis of all sex education programs; no evolution, creationism; 'get plenty of rest' to avoid sexually transmitted diseases). And finally appeal to the teachers who are traditionally more liberal than the rest of the populace.<br /><br />In this book, a number of commonly stated 'historical facts' are discussed with an attempt to set the record straight as based on historical documents that come from the time in question. This history covers basically all of American history from pre-revolutionary times to the Clinton era.<br /><br />I found the book to be great fun. It's written to present a side of the situations not often seen and in most situations gives both the historical documentation and suggestions for further reading.<br /><br />The parts on the Civil War (called in the south the War of Northern Agression, or more kindly the War Between the States) covers about a fifth of the book. I particularily liked the illustration of the Confederate general (four lines of piping on his sleeves) looking very unhappy at, I presume, the way the war has is treated by the history books.<br /><br />Is this revisionist history. It certainly revises the way history is being taught right now. Where's the truth - well in Dallas in 1963, what really happened was that a UFO - working with the CIA - landed, kidnapped the President and left the dead body of Hitler in its place and erased memory of everyone there with one of those flashing light things they had in 'Men in Black'.	2004-12-08

Far beyond the virus that might come on an e-mail, white collar crime is much more expensive than other kinds. A grocery store holdup might net a few hundred dollars, a bank robbery a few thousand, the average white collar crime is in the hundreds of thousands. And the price of information may be worth life itself as in the case of the Enigma codes in World War II.  <br /> <br />This book is balanced at at interesting level above the how to and below the highly theoretical. It has some of the theory, and some of the how to. More important, it explains the why and the how, the broad concepts that enable a manager concerned with security, or the new security manager to set up an effective system that is tailored to the risk, the company, the employees, and others who might have some access to their computer system.  <br /> <br />I would rate this book at an intermediate level to move the reader higher up the professional scale.

I couldn't remember all the things, so throughout the day I kept adding things, and fitting them into the priority list. By this evening I'd scratched off the top few highest priority items. There's still a long list, but this is still Monday, I have four more days and I think I can make it.  <br /> <br />I've got to say that some of his recommendations don't work well for me. For instance, starting the day early. We all have 24 hours a day, what difference if we start work at 5:30 in the morning, or if we work until 9 or ten at night. I find the evening hours free from the telephone, free from interruptions, and with no family and not liking television, I'd rather work later, read afterwards, sleep later work long hours and take many vacations. <br /> <br />Now for his comments on keeping your desk clean and filing stuff. He says that \\"as much as 30 percent of working time today is spent looking for misplaced items.\\" \\"As much as,\\" means between zero and 30%. My own experience is that the occasional looking for takes less time than constantly filing.  <br /> <br />I do not think that Mr. Tracy would disagree completely. In his last chapter, which is a summation, he says that you need a philosophy of time management, and it's got to be yours, one that you can live with, enjoy and meet your own goals.	2004-12-07

This is a very interesting book that uses military history to first illustrate and then teach leadership skills that are applicable to both military and business problems. In its discussion of the war situations, the two generals faced many of the same problems that other leaders face. The particular part of the Civil War being discussed is Grants moves towards Richmond during the summer of 1864.  <br /> <br />At the beginning of the summer, Lee had leadership probems with the people under him. He had lost 15 of the top 45 leaders of his army. He was faced with elevating people to positions where they had been promoted beyond their competence. Grant had just assumed leadership over an army about which he knew little and which was troubled by perceptions of incompetence and with bickering between generals of like rank but dislike of each other.  <br /> <br />Then the battles start, battles that have become so famous their very names ring with history: Wilderness, Spotsylvania, North Anna, Cold Harbor. Strangely enough they were all victories, of a sort, for the Confederates, but the net effect was to lose the war. Each battle, in the author's words has lessons to teach the modern leader.  <br /> <br />Major Bowery brings a supurb writing style to this book that blends the historical with the lesson with a simple switch of paragraphs. It's a delightful book, educational and a pleasure to read.	2004-12-07

No more questioning the unbridled power of the church. But the church was not all powerful, in places other than Italy observations continued. And the instruments used for observation became better and better, scientists could see further, and smaller, and with a better understanding of what they were seeing.  <br /> <br />Dr. Atkins has selected ten key central ideas of today's science and described them for the general public. But having said that, I must also say that this isn't a For Dummies book. His explanation, for instance, of some of the modern thinking in the physics of symmetry, quanta, cosmology and spacetime reaches the point where you either have to accept it on faith or spend a considersible amount of time with very high level mathematics.  <br /> <br />This is a book that presents the modern thinking at a level that most of it is understandable to most of us. Combine that with an elegent writing style, and reading it makes for a great deal of enjoyment.	2004-12-07

Yes, it's been thirty years since this game hit the streets. As movie actor Vin Diesel says in the introduction to this book: \\"We were all drawn to the bame because it allowed us to become these characters, vastly different in appearance and in actions, but what kept us hooked was the search for the character that represneted our higher self. Playing D&D was a training ground for our imaginations and an opportunity to explore our own identities.\\"  <br /> <br />This book is not on playing the game, it's not exactly a history, it's just a look back. There are parts and articles by Gary Gygax, creator of the game, by various people who have been involved with the game, there are photographs of people, events, bits of the game and more.	2004-12-07

A sub-title for this book could be - 'How to grind an old and proud company down to nothing.' I was a supplier to AT&T during much of the time covered by this book. (To be sure, AT&T was a major customer of mine, I was a minor, very minor supplier by their standards.) I watched the operations of AT&T from the outside while one bad decision after another was made.  <br /> <br />Most of this book deals with the final collapse of the company from the tail end of the Bob Allen years through the rotating door presidency that followed. The rotating door was bad, but my own belief is that the trouble started much earlier with the agreements Allen made to get into the computer business at any cost. He basically gave away the corporate jewels, the monopoly they had to get into computers (through the purchase of NCR) and then AT&T blew the computer business. I remember a senior manager moving into the computer business whose major previous claim to fame was setting up the first 911 call center. Boy, was he skilled at inter company politics, cost the company millions but he survived to go on to greater heights. And all this was happening while the communications technology was exploding.  <br /> <br />After that, the Tough Calls, as Mr. Martin calls them became necessary if for no other reason than to survive. If there is a single incident to use as an example of over paid incompetent executive leadership, it is AT&T.  <br /> <br />This book is written from the standpoint of the public relations department. I can't fault their actions. They had an impossible task. In fact, this book could serve as a primer on how to handle PR during a long sequence of disasters. It makes for great reading.	2004-12-07

Now retired, he finally has a chance to say things that he couldn't say on the air or anywhere else. In this book he talks about his life as a golfer, his life as a sportscaster, and his life as a man.  <br /> <br />He has not had a life that was all roses. Medical problems from carpal tunnel ended his professional golfing career after only 10 years of play. Other illnesses plagued he and his wife from back surgery to multiple bouts with cancer. He has not only survived these, but through it all has kept his sense of humor and overall happiness with the world.  <br /> <br />As an accomplished communicator, Mr. Venturi has the ability to tell stories about golf, about himself that make very good reading.	2004-12-07

The key, as Mr. LeGrand says, is that you have to work at it. Don't think that you won't have to pay your dues and work the problem.  <br /> <br />This book is a result of his experience in buying and selling houses, and even more in teaching other people how to buy and sell houses. It covers all the aspects. Finding the house, doing repairs that may be necessary, cleaning up the dead (One house I recently bought had a legal description saying that the lot was smaller than the house itself. It took three meetings of the city council, surveryors, public notices in the newspaper, etc. to get the legal description clear - the old legal description was written in 1869 and hadn't been changed in 135 years.)  <br /> <br />All the ins and outs are described here in clear and easy to understand terms. He reports on the deals he has made, some good, some not so good. Unfortunately that's the way he had to learn, reading his report is a lot easier than taking the hit in the pocket book and with the mental anguish. You won't learn everything you need to know from this book, consider it a start.	2004-12-07

The problems have come from the computer science department and the biology department having such fundamentally different goals. The computer scientists see the computer as an end in itself with no real thought on trying to do something useful with it. The biologists see the computer as just another tool in their laboratory. And the biological problems are huge, massive computers like the new Cray's and large Linux clusters are being devoted to biological applications.  <br /> <br />This book is intended to fit into the chasm between biology and computer science. It discusses computer the algorithmic principles in terms of practical techniques that make sense to the undergraduate biologist. The book is well suited for a first class for the budding bioinformaticist.  <br /> <br />Each main chapter in the book first introduces an algorithm, then it discusses the biologically relevant problems that this algorithm addresses, it includes a detailed problem and one or more solutions. Finally the chapter concludes with brief biographical sketches of leading figures in the field.  <br /> <br />This is the first book of its type, and it's likely to remain a classic in the field through many editions and many years.	2004-12-07

That is it quickly tells you what you need to do to accomplish the task. It is not a first time learners book.  Second it is a tutorial on the exam itself. While you need to know Word to be able to pass the test, the orientation of the book to just what to study to pass the test is important.

The development of these models, on the street and by academics alike have been at the heart of the big changes in financial money management over the last couple of decades.  <br /> <br />This book is positioned in an interesting place discussing derivative models in between the heavy theoretical approached used by the \\"pure\\" mathematicians and the \\"our analyst said\\" used by the sales reps.  <br /> <br />Here are the derivative models used in practice and focuses on their implementation using standard everyday C++ code. The models themselves are the most important derivative models used in practice today including pricing equity derivatives, options (standard and exotics including barrier, lookback, and Asian options), futures, and interest rate derivatives including caps, bond options, swaptions, swaps and credit derivatives.  <br /> <br />In most cases the mathematical underpinnings and derivation of the models are covered in a detailed and reasonably clear manner. This is illustrated with many example and numerical data as well as real market data being used for illustration. I say reasonably clear manner, because the book isn't written for the college graduate who picked his major on the basis of not having to take algebra.  <br /> <br />This is a book whose time has come.	2004-12-03

I find myself reading this book with mixed feelings. I give it a high rating for research and for writing. But then I find myself saying, who cares.   <br /> <br />There was an incident where an underage girl (and in her pictures she didn't look underaged at all, more like a hooker) at a local mall approached a pro basketabll player and soon went up to his hotel room. Later on she cried rape. As Mr. Benedict says, there's a thin line between consensual sex and rape.   <br /> <br />You take someone who comes from the wrong side of the tracks, you give him fame and a few million dollars, do you really expect someone you'd want to take home to mother and dad. These athletes aren't being selected for their social graces, they're being selected for basketball proficiency. I think that the book really explains what you'd expect to find.   <br /> <br />Finally, why select the NBA? I remember when it seemed that Dallas wouldn't be able to field a Cowboys team because so many team members were in jail. And so far as I know, the NBA players haven't bitten off any ears.

Born in Texas in 1878, only 13 years after the end of the Civil War, in the heyday of the Klu Klux Klan he emerged as an early day Mohammed Ali. As a fighter he was probably the best of his time. As a flamboyant character outside the ring he seemed deliberately out to tweak the noses of the white (and some of the black) establishment.  <br /> <br />And if he excelled in the ring, he truly triumphed at nose tweaking. He told outlandish stories. He attracted women of all races as he traveled from city to city and country to country. And as he took on all comers in the prize ring, he took on all comers among the ladies as well. This was enough, at that time in the South, to get him lynched.  <br /> <br />One of his episodes with a young lady resulted in him being convicted of the Mann act. This act made it illegal to transport womes across state lines for amoral purposes. Originally intended as a way to stop prostitution (who were they kidding), it was also applied in mixed race situations against the negro man. Eventually this gave him nearly a year in federal prison.  <br /> <br />Extensively researched, this is a brilliant biography of a most colorful character, who if he'd been white would have been a hero.	2004-12-03

The real question you have to ask about this book is, \\"Would the explosion of a nuke really cause a volcano eruption that would in turn cause the most destructive mega-tsunami in history.\\" I don't know. Mount St. Helens blew with a force estimated at 24 megatons. That's about 2,000 times the Hiroshima blast. \\"Mike\\" the first US H-bomb was 15 megatons.  <br /> <br />Mount St. Helens was triggered by an earthquake that caused a landslide that effectively removed the cap off of a high pressure chamber under the middle of the mountain. So yes, a fairly small nuke might releive the pressure on a volcano that is getting ready to blow anyway. Cause a tsunami, I think the volcano needs to be under water. Most destructive, if it hit New York, yup. <br /> <br />With that as a start, then this book begins to make sense. After this you start to get into other questions like how to deliver the weapon, where to place it, and so on. If you're a navy fiction writer, then you've got to use a boat to deliver the device, and simply putting it into a cargo container wouldn't be very cool. And of course your adversary has to be another navy man.  <br /> <br />OK, now I've told you the story. Is it a good story? I liked it. To be sure there are some technical mistakes like a missile going near the speed of light - well the author meant sound. That's no worse than so many mysteries where revolvers have safeties and never, never fail to go off when they are dropped on the ground. The characters are supermen. They're kind of like people you wish could go solve problems rather than the politicians that we get into office.  <br /> <br />This book is an easy, fast read, not bad for a cold winter weekend.	2004-12-03

There are also a lot on processing these images to create the special effects that you might want. But up until now I have not seen any that talk about converting these beautiful images into something so mundane as a picture you can put into an envelope and send home, or hang on the wall.  <br /> <br />Of course everyone starts out with an inexpensive ink jet printer, the kind you get at WalMart or where ever for only a few tens of dollars. The next step is to realize that the ordinary typing paper you've been using is not the best, so you go get some that promises photo quality.  <br /> <br />If the result you're getting with this approach is satisfactory for your needs, you need go no further, and this book probably isn't for you. I say probably, because there are hints here on paper, ink and techniques that will help you get the most out of any printer.  <br /> <br />But if you want to go further, up to advanced amateur standing or beyond, then I'd consider this book a necessity. It covers everything. From printer technologies, to specific brands, to inks, to papers.  <br /> <br />At this level, you're not talking about $29.95 printers, and just getting the right printer is worth far more than the cost of this book. It clearly represents the state of the art in photo printing today.	2004-12-03

Submarine disasters usually happen like the rest of the things about subs, alone, silent and deadly. Of the 52 boats lost during WWII, some are still unaccounted for, just not yet returned from patrol. With the Kursk, we know what happened. Experimental hydrogen peroxide powered torpedoes exploded inside the boat. (Strangely enough it appears that the American submarine Scorpion sank in 1968 because of a fire in their torpedos.)  <br /> <br />The main part of this book, however, is not on what happened to the Kursk. It is on what happened afterward. The coverups by the Russian military and Government. The less than stellar performance of the American and British navies in delaying the offer of help.  <br /> <br />This part of the book is extensively researched. It's tragic, but unfortunately the way of the world. People don't want to tell their managers bad news.  <br /> <br />I've got to add that at least one wit has come up with another answer, it was Microsoft Windows XP.

First it was the Nazi's and the likes of Eric Ambler had quite a good time with them. Then came the long cold war, with Clancy, Le Carre, and Ian Fleming. Martin Cruz Smith wrote one then called Gorky Park. Not so much a spy story as a murder mystery but set in the Moscow.  <br /> <br />Then peace broke out. No more the monolithic Soviet Union but a bunch of 'stans and Russia. No more KGB but common money grubbing criminals. And why would we care any more about Russian criminals than we do our own. Put the criminals in New York, we can believe more about that.  <br /> <br />Mr. Smith has done it differently. Through this series of five Arkady Renko novels the country has changed, but Arkady hasn't changed as much. He is still chasing murderers. His superiors want things swept under the carpet to make them look better. And eventually he is sent to the Chernobyl Zone of Exclusion, the thirty kilometer evacuation zone around the destroyed nuclear plant. <br /> <br />I recently received some pictures from this zone, and I was surprised to see that they match very well with the scene as Mr. Smith describes it. The pictures didn't however show any of the most interesting characters Mr. Smith has created. Good story, great characters, set in a very unusual place.	2004-12-02

There are popularized TV shows that attempt to explain away hoaxes that have been played on the public. Unfortunately there are more that want to explain things in terms of some kind of mystical world of UFOs, Atlantis, or whatever.  <br /> <br />In this book, Dr. Dawkins is attempting the first. This is a collection of essays written (and most of the times published) over a period of twenty five years that collectively make up an enthusiastid declaration, a testament to the power of rigorous scientific examination to reveal the wonders of the world.  <br /> <br />Each little essay is a pearl of wisdom.

He sometimes reminds me of the old adage, 'don't confuse me with facts, my mind is made up.'  <br /> <br />His writing is beautiful. I can't summarize the book any better than the closing of the last essay, an open letter to his then ten-year-old daughter, it ends, \\"And, next time somebody tells you that something is true, why not say to them: 'What kind of evidence is there for that?' And if they can't give you a good answer, I hope you'll think very carefully before you believe a word they say.\\"	2004-12-02

When it hits the fan, you are still the one responsible (especially so now with Sarbanes-Oxley in force, the real rules of which we still do not understand and won't until it's been to court a few times). You have more control over your own people, and you can much more carefully monitor them. This is especially true if the outside company has reduced its cost by establishing the monitoring center in some place like India. You can much more easily check to see if your new employee has just come from a few years vacation in Marion, Illinois.  <br /> <br />It would be interesting to see how outsourcing information security would be treated by upper management. It's a cinch that they wouldn't understand enough to make a valid decision. You have to make the decision yourself, and unfortunately then you have to live with it.  <br /> <br />This book is just about the only one on this subject.

If you're going to start off learning to build database driven web sites today, you probably want to use LAMP. LAMP - Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. Each of these technologies is complex enough that a dedicated book, and this book is THE BOOK for PHP. Having said that, I need to add that this is not a book intended for the beginner. It is intended for people already working in PHP 4 to upgrade their skills up to PHP 5. It is written by the people largely responsible for bringing PHP to the state it is today. They know whereof they speak. To be sure there are chapters at the beginning of the book that provide a basic introduction, but they are a bit terse when compared to the typical beginners level book.  <br /> <br />So what are the new features that this book is particularly designed to cover: The basic underlying structure of the language has been changed for more object orientation. This fits into the concepts of more recently designed languages. Yes, Martha, PHP is definitely a language. The next most important part of the upgrade is greatly improved support for producing and parsing XML code. While there are many more changes, these are the major.  <br /> <br />One of the authors of the book, Stig Bakken, is the creator of PEAR (PHP Extension and Application Repository). There are three chapters discussing PEAR. PEAR is itself a fairly complex language, so this serves as an introduction to give you enough information to know if this is for you.  <br /> <br />Summary: An excellent book for the intermediate level PHP programmer who wants to move up. A bit imposing for a beginner.	2004-12-02

As a biography it's just about like all the others: Ancesters came from .... Father worked as .... Went to school at .... In short, the book has all of the things that you's expect in a biography. And it's a pretty good biography. You get a feeling of the man, his capabilities, his goals, desires and abilities.  <br /> <br />You also get an insiders view of how the White House works. The author says that Cheney is the hard working driver who actually runs things. It could then be argued that this leavs Bush time to think about the overall goals of his administration. After all, Clinton and Carter were both so detail oriented that they lost sight of the bigger goals and didn't get much accomplished. Reagan was apparently more of a thinker, he would set the overall policy and then take a nap while his staff worked out the details. Perhaps Bush does the same.  <br /> <br />In addition, you get an attack on Cheney (and at no extra charge on Bush) that's worthy of a Michael Moore movie. It seems like the author is almost rabid about Mr. Cheney. That's not good, bad for your digestion, your heart, your sanity to be that angry about something. Then again, perhaps this book is written for comedy. It is a very funny book	2004-12-01

Salamis is one of those battles that is still studied in history. The little guy (300+ ships) beat the heavy weight navy of the time. They did it with supurb tactics that emphasised their strengths while outsmarting the Persians.  <br /> <br />This extensively researched book is centered on the naval battle, but it is set in its place with descriptions of other parts of the war. This includes the battle at Thermopylae where Leonidas and the Spartans were defeated. It also includes an amazing amount of detail on the two countries, their cultures and the times in general.  <br /> <br />Finally I have to say that the authors writing style makes this read like a Tom Clancy novel. It's filled with technical details, heros and ordinary men. Not a big book, it is a delight to read.	2004-12-01

It's not really a how-to book (though it has a few short guides), it's her autobiography. It was a rough life. Left home early, no education, raped, abused, addicted to drugs she could well have been one of our total outcasts. Instead, through stunning beauty combined with an excellent set of brains, she has defined herself at the top of the porn movie business.  <br /> <br />You don't normally associate porn stars with brains, but they sure come through in this book. Her 10 Thou Shalt Not's for men rank right up there for best humor. And she has taken her position in the movies as a start to forming her own production company and then set herself up as the CEO of ClubJenna, Inc., a video production, licensing, internet development and management firm for more than a dozen adust stars. Dummies don't do these things.  <br /> <br />The sub-title of the book is \\"A Cautionary Tale.\\" And cautionary it is. This is certainly not the life you'd want your daughter to live. But it's certainly fascinating being a voyeur on the side. Glad she made it, glad she wrote it.	2004-12-01

Cluster supercomputers became originated when NASA had a need for another supercomputer but no budge to buy one. The particular tasks that they needed to perform tended to have a lot of parallelism. That is, they could benefit by having a bunch of systems work on small tasks and then bring the results together. An example of an ideal parallel application is provessing seismic data. Basically you have the signals to process from a bunch of sensors and each data stream is independent of the other until the end of the process. An example of a non-parallel system is inventory. When you are increasing or decreasing inventory, you only have one bin of this part, and two CPU's better not sell the same part twice.  <br /> <br />Anyway Don Becker and some others proposed using a cluster of PC's to handle the tasks. They wrote a software package called Beowulf to run under Linux. Linus had two real advantages: stability and cost. It's much more stable than Microsoft systems and it's free. This, as is often the case in the computer biz, started a landslide.  <br /> <br />This book is the most complete I've read on how to build a cluster. It goes extensively into every aspect. It talks about the architecture of the various CPU's in use (Itanium, Xeron, Opteron), high speed interconnection systems (Myricom, Infiniband, Dolphin, Quadrics), available software (Suse, Red Hat, management systems) -- in short everything you need to get the system up and running.  <br /> <br />If you're new to clustering, here is an integrated, step by step approach to getting the system up. Of course you'll need more books later (FORTRAN, Message Passing Interface, etc.) but this is the place to start.	2004-12-01

Linux has been the tekkies choice for operating systems for some time. But making it to the desktop is necessary before it can really grow up. Finally, people are beginning to put together simple to install systems that don't take a lot of reading about strange acronyms.  <br /> <br />This book uses MEPIS. It's software on a CD that just like the title says you point and click. You put the MEPIS CD in a PC and in a few minutes you have a graphical screen asking you just a few questions (and in English) and then you have a graphical (I hate to, but I've got to use the word) window in front of you.  <br /> <br />No the screen isn't exactly like the other Windows, but it's fairly recognizable. You have a bunch of icons on the screen that correspond to the programs that were automatically installed on the system. Unlike Big Windows, MEPIS comes with most of the applications you'll need for traditional desktop use. This includes word processing, spreadsheets, presentation programs, graphics programs, etc. It does not include a full distribution with things like web server, database and so on, but you can install them yourself.  <br /> <br />For you tekkies, MEPIS uses the Debian distribution, with KDE, and OpenOffice. Because Linux changes so often, instructions are included on how to go to various web sites and get the latest version.  <br /> <br />This book has literally everything you need to get Linux running on your desktop in about five minutes. Great idea that's been a long time coming.	2004-12-01

In order to use it the high priest had to wear a breastplace containing twelve sacred gemstones called the Stones of fire. These objects were kept in the Great Temple of Jerusalem until they vanished following the Babylonian invasion in 597 BC.  <br /> <br />The author of this book is Graham Phillips. Graham Phillips has been one of Britain's best-selling non-fiction authors for over twenty years. In 1981, after working as a radio journalist and broadcaster for the BBC and editing a popular monthly magazine, Graham first turned his talents to investigating unsolved historical mysteries. He has since written thirteen books which are in print around the world and have been published in ten different languages.  <br /> <br />In this book he reports on evidence he uncovered that 13th century Templars found the Arc and the Stones of Fire and that they brought these treasures back to central England when they fled persecution of French king Philip the Fair a century later. Following leads from the Middle East he turned to some churches in the English midlands and ... well that would be telling.	2004-12-01

It had the headline \\"Homeland Security,\\" then a picture of a handfull of indian warriors of the late 1800's, and finally another line of type: \\"Fighting Terriorism Since 1492.\\"  <br /> <br />This Tee-Shirt uses just a bit of humor to make us see ourselves in a quite different light. This book brilliantly takes this concept a giant step further. The authors take fifty subjects, from the Viking Exploration to The New World Order, then they print a view on this subject from other countries. For the Viking Exploration there are two other views, one from Norway, and one from Canada. On Slavery they have reports from Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Portugal, Great Britain and Mexico.  <br /> <br />Where the report was in English it is reprinted as is. Otherwise it was translated with instructions to the translators to keep the language as close to the original as possible, in both syntax and vocabulary.  <br /> <br />I have only one request of the authors. If there is a new revision, add religion. I suspect that the Islambic world sees us as doomed infidels, and after the recent election I suspect that Europe sees us almost as fanatically religious as they to the Islambic world.	2004-12-01

If you are not familiar with the story, 123 members of the 6th Rangers sneaked through enemy lines to the prison camp, killed all the guards and got the men out.  <br /> <br />It was not common for such break outs to be attempted. And the reason for the rescue at Cabanatuan was the massacre at Palawan.  <br /> <br />Palawan was an offshoot of Cabanatuan, some 150 prisoners from Cabanatuan had been sent to Palawan as slave workers. They spent two and a half years working on the air strip. Then on December 15, 1944 the Americans landed on Mindoro. So the Japanese decided to execute the 150 prisoners. They missed eleven who managed to escape.  <br /> <br />This is the story of one young marine. From all the people in the USMC he bacame one of the 7,000 Americans captured at Corregidor, and one of the eleven to survive Palawan.  <br /> <br />As I read this book, my first thought was to damn the Japanese. Their culture of Bushido created an environment where such events happened. Then I thought of the Islamic terrorists, or cult or whatever you'd call it in Iraq who yesterday beheaded someone just to get it in the news. And that lead me to the events in the prison in Iraq where we Americans didn't exactly act with honor.  <br /> <br />This is a book, not only excellently written, but tells of a side of the war not often reported. And forces you to think of other places, other incidents. Highly recommended.	2004-11-30

The first chapter is about building a dozen primative designs. But in the first paragraph of the first chapter she says go look at the finished designs on the DVD. I've never seen a better approach to tell you just what you are trying to do before you get started on the actual doing. It seems like so many computer forget to tell you just what you're trying to do. After you know what you're trying to do, then step by step, each illustrated. you build the model.  <br /> <br />Chapter 2 gets a bit technical, you may be tempted to skip it --so she starts it by saying that if you are planning to become proficient don't even think about skipping it. And so it continues, you're building a car, adjusting surfaces, designing birthday cakes - with legs that dance.  <br /> <br />Besides C4D, there is also a chapter on BodyPaint 3D, the companion software from Maxon. There is also a chapter on using C4D in conjunction with other packages such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Zbrush and more.  <br /> <br />This is a sourcebook, a tutorial on how to use the software. It just happens to be one of the better writting of these I've ever seen.	2004-11-30

North Korea is indeed facing perilous times. Then again it has in the past. From the 1950 war, the transition of power Kim Il Sung to Kim Jong Il, and the nuclear weapon agreement brokered by Jimmy Carter the recent history of North Korea has certainly been turbulent.  <br /> <br />In more recent times, Korea has launched some very long range rockets and appears to have at least a few nuclear weapons. President Bush has identified them as a \\"rogue state\\" and part of the \\"axis of evil.\\" North Korea along with Cuba remain as practictioners of the failed Communist system. These systems have proved that they can sustain huge armies, exercise strong control over their people, but also proved that centralized control of everything from farming to industrial production simply doesn't work very well. Friends of mine who recently visited North Korea report that the famine of the 1990's continues, although not as bad as it was.  <br /> <br />A small book, at only 232 pages, it is a concise summary of the countries 4,000 year history and a political analysis of the recent past. Combined with this are several alternatives of what the future might hold. Can the status quo continue. Certainly not forever. Could the collapse of the Government bring about another war - certainly it could. The options and their likelyhood form a major part of the theme of the book, and they are carefully considered and disucssed. Excellent reading.	2004-11-30

In fact, in this book I find some major contradictions. On the one hand he discusses the American involvement as being fundamentally flawed by a failure to understand the overall situation. But he also says that America had a viable, urgent, imperative to go to war with Iraq when it did. He states that the Iraqi populace is willingly embracing traditionalist radical Islam as the sole power capable of shielding them against American encroachment. Yet, the divisions of Kurd, Shiite and Sunni seem so large as to prevent any legitimate use of the term \\"the Iraqi populace.\\"  <br /> <br />The author's bringing to the fore a litany of facts, most of which I've confirmed from various web sites, that are indeed \\"secrets\\" so far at our television media seem to cover the story, are worth the price of the book by themselves. But I would have liked to have seen a little more supporting evidence on these points.  <br /> <br />It's certainly clear that winning the peace after the war is proving more difficult than planned. (Or was it planned at all?) But it isn't clear just why. In talking to some recent Iraqi visitors to this country, they are asking only why it took the US so long to come in and wipe out Saddam. They say that the troubles are only being caused by a handful of fringe groups who are afraid of losing power themselves.  <br /> <br />This is a book you can't afford to miss, yet don't make this the only book you read.	2004-11-30

So part of this manual is how to use their on-line service aids as well as the software tools that they have produced to aid the service technician.  <br /> <br />There are some distinct advantages to Apple's approach of having one vendor for the whole system. The motherboards, for instance, are all designed around common design criteria, common interface structure, and specialized to operate with common software. Common service techniques are another advantage. Here in one book everything can be covered from wireless lan to displays to motherboards.

Ms. Bradford's biography, probably destined to be the definitive work, present her in a somewhat different vein. Her view is more sympathetic, more of a pawn of a power hungry family than the untimate femme fatal.  <br /> <br />Married off by the political whim of her father and brother when she was thirteen, divorced, then married for a second time before she turned twenty. Her second husband was murdered by Cesare. She learned how a woman could obtain power in a society ruled by men, and her next marriage was of her own choosing. She then proved to be an enlightened ruler, a skilled administrator and a friend to the arts.  <br /> <br />This is a tale of sex, gossip, murder, astonishing beauty and ambition -- and this was the time of the Renaissance when the arts were flourishing, when the ancient writings of the Romans and Greeks were marking the end of the dark ages.  <br /> <br />Fascinating Book.	2004-11-26

It seems like golf has always had a shining star or two that go beyond the game to making a lasting impression on the world at large. And Arnie certainly fit that. He generated an image for a generation of people, inspiring to do better in their work, in their life. Not the world's best golfer, he's simply Arnie, the world famous guy next door. His approachability and down-home humility have secured his status as one of the most admired people in and out of sports.   <br /> <br />This book could almost be his scrapbook. It combines stories, both personal and professional, rare photos from his private collection and removable facsimilies of twelve collectibles from his archives.   <br /> <br />This is a fascinating book with which to curl up during the long winter months. A good Christmas present for the golfer in the family.	2004-11-26

The philosophy of the series is to use a lot of photographs so that you can see what the screen should look like as you do various tasks during the learning process.  <br /> <br />The organization of the book, after an introduction that you really should read or at least glance over, is modular just like the software. There's a part on Word, on Excel, on PowerPoint, and on Entourage. Each part is self standing and can be used independently of the other parts. You can read the part on the software you need without having to go do everything at once. Although to be sure you will sooner or later want to use the various applications together, and for this there is Part VI: Combining the Applications.  <br /> <br />As a visually oriented book, there are hundreds of pictures/drawings to illustrate just about every point. It's a very fast way to get started.	2004-11-26

Seeing a very good thing, Apple bought Astarte in April of 2000 and turned it into DVD Studio Pro for a price of $1,000. The first release was - well it was a first release. In competition with this software was DVDMaestro, a quite advanced product, but also a quite advanced $25,000.  <br /> <br />Apple mixed all this technology together with the golden third release at only $499. All of a sudden professional quality DVD authoring was available to virtually anyone.  <br /> <br />This book starts with a discussion on what hardware you need to work with DVD Studio Pro 3. DVD files are huge, often measured in gigabytes. You'll need processing power, memory, and disk space. Starting from this simple view, it continues in a step by step basis through every aspect of producing a DVD. The writing style is clear and concise, with just the right amount of theory mixed in with practical instruction. Considered an intermediate level book, this is not exactly a beginners 'this is how you turn it on' book.  <br /> <br />You'll note that this is also a very reasonably priced book.	2004-11-26

But what about the Douglas X-3 Stiletto that looked like it was going about a thousand miles an hour while it was still sitting on the ground. What about the X-32 or the X-45 or the D-558 (a Navy experimental plane - the Air Force and NASA use the X designation).  <br /> <br />The planes and many more are here. Note the title says this is a Photo Scrapbook. It is. There are 450 black and white photographs and 50 color prints. Along with the pictures is a bit of commentary explaining what they were trying to do, what happened, perhaps what happened to the plane after the testing was completed. Down through the years a lot of rather funny looking planes have been built for one purpose or another, And it's great to see so many unusual planes pictured in one place.	2004-11-25

But where are we now?  <br /> <br />Jason Tennent, an investment strategist of international fame, has written this book which talks about using the old fashioned basics combined with new analysis, strategies and techniques.  <br /> <br />He reports on finding types of companies that stand poised to outperform markets in both the short and long term. As a contrarian, he gives some reasons and examples of why the crowd is almost always wrong. And finally he discusses the importance of value in companies. Remember the dot.coms again.

So was wiring, framing walls, building a stair way, roofing, venting gas appliances, and there's a section on solar heating systems.

I was expecting to see comments of having a dream of being your own boss, etc. Then I found a section on Why a Home-Based Business at Fifty-Plus - and it was right on. the authors listed seven reasons people would want to keep working and Why a Home-Based Business at Fifty-Plus makes sense.  <br /> <br />The third reason was \\"Unexpected Problems Have Sidetracked Our Plans.\\" My father worked for one company for 35+ years, then they laid him off.  <br /> <br />The sixth reason was \\"Ageism is a reality.\\" A number of friends of mine have somehow found themselves out of jobs at fifty-plus and no one is interested in them. A few have gotten jobs of the Walmart greeter or McDonalds varieties. The happiest ones are running a small business at home.  <br /> <br />My own observations are that you won't need as much money as you did while working. The second reason stated in the book was \\"We're Concerned We Will Need to Work.\\" It reports that most experts say we need to replace 75%-80% of our income to live comfortably when we leave the workforce. That's probably true if you maintain the same kind of expenses. But after the house is paid for, the car is paid for, and the kid is out of college, your need for income can really go down. But I'm just quibbling over details. I would certainly agree that it would be difficult to live on Social Security alone.  <br /> <br />The authors then discuss some seventy small businesses that they have found fifty-plus people operating successfully. Of coure all 70 won't appeal to you, but you only want one. Above all else, these seventy businesses may serve as a starting point for you to decide on just that business that fits you. Good Book.	2004-11-25

We have had surprisingly few biographies of the Native Americans who were here long before our arrival. And many of the biographies we do have are primarily of the warrior aspect concentrating on the conflict aspects.  <br /> <br />Here we have a first rate biography written by a Lakota historian raised in the same Lakota community that raised Crazy Horse. It is based on extensive research combined with the rich oral tradition that is rarely shared outside the local community.  <br /> <br />Crazy Horse is remembered by most Americans as the leader and participant in the Battle of the Little Big Horn. There is obviously more to the man, more to a life than one battle. To his fellow Lakota indians, he was a dutiful son and humble fighting man who, with valor, spirit, respect, and unparelleled leadership fought for his people's land, lifelihood, and honor. His personal life, the woman he loved but due to duty and circumstance was destined to marry another, make us realize that here was a good man put into tragic circumstances.	2004-11-25

The airplane is the Corky, a B-24 Liberator. The story starts with the people the made up the crew before they entered the military service. Finally on  Tuesday 7 September 1943 the crew met together as Crew 25, 734th Squadron, 453 Bomb Group. Five months later on the 5th of February the first of a couple of milk runs over France, within a week they were over Germany. By the 25th of June the crew, not without loss, had completed their combat tours. Their war was over.  <br /> <br />Stuart Wright is from the small village in England where the 453rd was stationed. He grew up on stories about the Yanks in and around the village. A chance meeting when he was fourteen began a friendship and collaboration with Bill Eagleson, the pilot of Crew 25. Years of research later, this book is the result. As Mr. Wright says: \\"This is not so much a book about airplanes or war; but a book about people.\\" One crew of people that made a difference.	2004-11-24

It's really about how taxes are collected on various types of business structures. It discusses the various business organizations such as sole proprietorships, limited liability companies (LLCs), and corporations. Under corporations both C and S corporations are covered. (I can't think of a catchy title to say that, so I guess the book can stay named as it is.) <br /> <br />Most of the book is on the S corporation. This makes sense as most small business should probably be S corporations. The small business isn't going to attract large numbers of investors. By shifting the income of the business to an S you can often save several thousand dollars in taxes by shifting between salary and dividends or what the IRS calls earned income and passive income.  <br /> <br />When I got the book I had a couple of questions in mind like \\"how much salary should I pay myself.\\" These questions aren't answered in most \\"how to incorporate\\" type books. What I wanted was two answers, what does the law say, and what are the real rules. I got both answers quickly and easily.  <br /> <br />For me, the information I wanted was covered in about 10% of the book, the rest of the material I either knew or didn't care about. That 10% that I needed saved me many, many times the cost of the book.	2004-11-24

This is a book on how to hack into computer systems to teach you more about how to protect yourself from hackers. This is a lot like the military uses schools like Top Gun to teach warriors how the expected opposition fights.  <br /> <br />Hacks into systems are generally based on bugs in the code. Generally accepted guidelines say that there are 5 to 50 bugs per thousand lines of code. Windows XP has approximately 40 million lines of code -- That says somewhere between 200,000 and 2,000,000 bugs in XP alone.  <br /> <br />This book will teach you what hackers are doing, the legal aspects, the damage done and most important how to avoid your own systems getting maliciously hacked. It is not intended for the beginner - when you're reverse engineering binary files or investigating what's happening with the stack your're pretty deep into what's happening in the system.  <br /> <br />This is the most complete, most detailed book I've seen on hacking.	2004-11-24

From McDonalds, to coffee shops, to airports people are opening up their notebooks and connecting to the world. With this growth these WLANs become targets for hackers with malicious intent. This book is intended for network engineers who design, configure, implement, and maintain secure WLANs.  <br /> <br />With a WLAN it is importent to remember that Wireless means Radio. Radio means that you are transmitting data over the airways. And if you are transmitting, other people can be receiving. Usually of course the messages you are sending are received by the base station and sent on with no one caring. But there is no way to prevent physical access to signals being broadcast. The network administrator should recognize that there is no way to prevent someone from listening to your signals, and that such listening will be undetectable.  <br /> <br />The basic 802.11 standard defines certain basic authentication and privacy methods, in fact there is a whole chapter in this book on just that subject. The security system being implemented will need to build on these basic rules by implementing various defensive systems. All of these are exhaustively discussed in this book in a clear and understandable manner.	2004-11-24

In this third book of their series on Luftwaffe Secret projects the authors have found some 140 aircraft that were proposed and/or developed for military use by the various German companies. The war years, for Germany were accompanied by great leaps in engine design. The engines of the ME-262 jet fighter, the rocket engine of the ME-163, the V-1 Buzz bombs pulse jet engine and improved traditional engines were all becoming available for new air frame designs.  <br /> <br />Further experience on the battlefield had also brought a greater understanding of the needs for new aircraft designs. The German companies responded with a series of designs. Many of these designs look surprisingly like the designs proposed by American and British companies during the early 1950's as these kinds of new engines were becoming available over here. In one case the comparison is so close that there is a picture of a Junkers 1941 ground attack aircraft and a photograph of an American A-10 Warthog on facing pages.  <br /> <br />Many of the other aircraft proposed, especially by Blohn and Voss are so goofy looking that I'm reminded of the old saying, \\"if it looks good it will fly good.\\" In the case of Blohm & Voss, it's apparently the other way around. Reports that I've seen say that their planes fly well, in spite of how goofy they look.  <br /> <br />A book to be read a couple of times and to serve as the basis for a lot of conversation with other airplane buffs.	2004-11-24

It is not intended for beginners, it presumes that you have the basics of Java down pretty well and are just looking to see what the new features might mean to you and the coding job your working on right now. Because it is a fairly small book, only a couple of hundred pages, it only hits the highlights of these new language extensions. It's enough to give you an idea if this feature will help you.  <br /> <br />The V5.0 release is a prettly large release, incorporating a lot of new features.

The people in power, let's call them Tribe 1, decided to eliminate the Tribe 2. A few years later Tribe 2 has gained power so began the slaughter/genocide of Tribe 1.  <br /> <br />In this book Tribe 1 is the Huto, Tribe 2 is the Tutsi. Unfortunately this is a story so often repeated that the names almost do not matter. This could have been any of a number of countries.  <br /> <br />And the countries do not have to be in Africa. We had the Holocaust in Germany, Ethnic Clensing in what was left of Yugoslavia. We've had people seemingly going nuts as they did in China's Cultural Revolution. And then there are places like Israel, Northern Ireland and oh so many more.  <br /> <br />The story though keeps coming back to Africa. Taking place in the mid 1990's, this is a story of Africa, its leadership, such as it is. And it's a story of Africa before AIDS.  <br /> <br />The story in this book is a story of the survival of a Huto woman at the hands of the Tutsi. It's a story of struggle against terrible odds -- and she made it.	2004-11-24

We know about the midget submarines at Parh Harbor, the Doolittle raid, breaking the Japanese code at Station Hypo which led to our victory and Midway and so on.  <br /> <br />What makes this book so good is the stories of the men. How Col. North found the seaman manning the gun on the USS Ward which sank one of the midget subs, the Corporal on one of Doolittle's B-25s, a crewman from the Yorktown which was lost at Midway I can't imagine.

The problem is simplely stated: How do you find the shortest path for a travelling sales_____ to drive as he visits a series of customers.  <br /> <br />If you're just running a few errands it's easy enough. If you're going to the supermarket, the post office, the dry cleaners, and the gas station, it's pretty easy to determine the shortest path. But then you add constraints, nearly out of gas, go to gas station first. Buying ice cream at the super market, better make it the last stop.  <br /> <br />This is a real world problem. It is faced every day by delivery companies like the post office and air freight companies who spend huge amounts of fuel flying jet freighters around the world -- where do you put a hub, how do you schedule everything to come together.  <br /> <br />FedEx solved this problem by running everything through Memphis. This works really well for a package going from New York to LA. It works less well for a package going from Manhattan to the Bronx. And if the package is going from London to Manchester ....  <br /> <br />The computation of this and similar problems fall into the general category of Stochastic Local Search. And this book is the first to offer a systematic and unified treatment of SLS. Before this there were a series of technical papers, magazine articles and chapters in more general texts. The book provides the first unified view of the entire field and offers an extensive review of state-of-the-art algorithms and their applications. A companion website offers lecture slides as well as source code and Java applets for exploring and demonstrating the algorithms.	2004-11-24

The early 1950's were a time when anything could be done by the military. The B-70 Valkyrie was one project. It was a beautiful plane, the culmination of big, fast, high-flying manned bombers.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately at that time there were simply too many such projects. The whole century series fighter program was under way, several missile projects, the Dyna-Soar project, and unfortunately by the end of the development program the Viet Nam War. At the same time, anti-air defense systems were increasing in capabilities -- witnes Gary Powers and the U-2 incident. <br /> <br />This book is truly splendid in its story of the times. While it is mostly on the B-70, it's table of contents reads, in part, as follows:  <br /> <br />The Atomic Powered Airplane  <br />The Mach 3 fighter - XF-103 and XF-108  <br />High Energy Fuels  <br /> <br />All of these projects were underway, not a single one made it into production.  <br /> <br />Beautiful book, beautifully illustrated with hundreds of photographs, drawings and illustrations of the concepts of the atomic plane and the conceptual drawings that eventually led to the B-70.	2004-11-24

So our servers talked not only to our database but connected to some other system to get data about the credit card's validity and to deposit the money received.  <br /> <br />There have become a huge number of web services available. To list just a few, there's Amazon, eBay, Google, FedEx, Pay Pal, InterFAX. From a web site you can link to these sites and get information from them that you can then integrate into your own site.  <br /> <br />With this huge number of web services that have become available, there have become a new set of problems. Which services, which interfaces work in the real world? ==In this book, Will Iverson presents his experiences with several real world, actually operating web services. He provides detailed examples of contacting several big web sites including the programming necessary to interface to them.  <br /> <br />This book is written for the Java journeyman. To quote from Chapter 3, \\"You should be familiar with basic object-oriented development, know how to add libraries to your class path, understand TCP/IP and basic networking, and be familiar with basic JSP-based web application development.  <br /> <br />I'm not. I use Cold Fusion to do my web programming. I found the descriptions in the book entirely adequate to get me started in programming what I needed. I'm glad he did the programming because that proved that the services worked. What's important in this book is not the programming, it's the real world experience of what's really working right now out there in the real world.	2004-11-23

This they say is the basic right, and societies that do not protect that right can never be reliable partners for peace, and that the democracy that hates is much safer than the dictatorship that loves us.  <br /> <br />While there is every reason to doubt that freedom will prevail in the Middle East, this book declares unequivocally that the skeptics are wrong. They the believe that tyranny  can be consigned to history's dustbin if the free world stays true to its ideals.  <br /> <br />Sometimes I think it takes someone who has lived under a regime like the Soviet Union to remind us of what we have. It's not the false promises made by both Kerry and Bush during the last election, it's that we could have such an election at all.	2004-11-23

In rankings of the American Presidents, the consensus pick as the first great president of the twentiety century was also the youngest man ever to serve in the office: Theodore Roosevelt. Reformer, rancher, conservationist, hunter, historian, police commissioner, and soldier, Theodore roosevelt led a rich and varied life that he vividly recorded in autobiographical writings, letters, and speeches.  <br /> <br />This book contains two books, both written by Roosevelt and edited by Roosevelt biographer Louis Auchincloss:  <br /> <br />The Rough Riders (1899) is the story of the First U.S. Volunteer Cavalry. This was the unit raised by Roosevelt, trained in Texas and then shipped to Cuba. This was a time when war could still be seen as a romantic adventure -- unlike what happened in France twenty years later. The biggest problems faced by Roosevelt were: the jungle, the heat, hunger, rain, mud and malaria. Kind of incidentally they also had a war to fight.  <br /> <br />An Autobiography (1913) recalls his lifelong fascination with natural history, his love of hunting and the outdoors, and his adventures as a cattleman in the Dakota Badlands, as well as his career in politics as a state legislator, civil service reformer, New York City police commissioner, assistant secretary of the navy, governor of New York, and president. What a life.	2004-11-23

Many books are written on the history of World War II, from big stories of the movement of great armies, to the tales of heroic acts. This is not such a tale but a simple story of a young boy in Wisconsin (but the same story took place in every state). The young boy, born in November of 1940, writes of life in America during the war. Living in a happy family he was four years old when the telegram arrived at his family's home informing them of his father's death.  <br /> <br />His father did not die the heroic death that you make movies about, it was an ordinary soldiers death. What makes it special is the writing in this book. At once historical, memories and poignant. It is an often heart-rending picture of life in wartime America.  <br /> <br />Don't attempt to read this book without a hankerchief at hand.	2004-11-23

I'd suggest that first you watch the movie Shekhar Kapur's 1998 film Elizabeth in conjunction with the book. The film is about Elizabeth taking over as Queen, and taking Sir Robert Dudley as a lover.  <br /> <br />This book is about the same time frame, but written more from the side of Sir Robert and particularly that of his wife Amy. This is a novel, after all who can really report on the detailed conversations between people so long ago. But it is exhaustively researched to give both the actual events and more especially the tone of the times when a young virgin queen took over a bankrupt country, riven by enmity, where treason is normal and foreign war a certainty and dissension between Catholics and Protestants tore at the very foundation of society.	2004-11-23

This huge (1176 page) book is intended for Excel users and programmers from beginning to advanced, this book presumes you have a reasonable working knowledge of excel and a full installation of the software. It does not presume that you have a working knowledge of VBA, after all, that's it's subject.  <br /> <br />In fact, chapter 1 is titled Primer in Excel VBA. Excel VBA is, of course, a specialized version of Microsoft's standard VBA, where those specific points that cater to spread sheet manipulation are differrent from the VBA's associated with other parts of the Microsoft Office package.  <br /> <br />This book gives a general introduction to VBA, but it is entirely within the context of Excel. This is indeed a Primer. It starts with how you open the Visual Basic Editor and goes on from there. Generally the book grows step by step. But not always. ==On page 83 it says: \\"OnTime - You can use the OnTime method to schedule a macro to run sometime in the future.\\" OK, I understand this. But only 7 pages later it says: \\"VBA does support interface polymorphism. Interface polymorphism is orthogonal to class polymorphism.\\" Huh? Does this help me schedule something to run in the future? Is this supposed to mean anything at all to me? Since I have no idea what it's talking about am I supposed to go look up all these new words somewhere? Is this really going to help me? Anyway, you skip a few chapters and you're back into getting some useful information about things like creating user forms.  <br /> <br />All in all I rate the book quite high. Everything you always wanted to know is there. And it is supposed to be a reference manual, not a tutorial. My only complaint is that I think it could have organized a bit better.	2004-11-23

Note that this is a book based on the Beta release of the software. Usually, emphasize usually, Microsoft Beta software is actually pretty far along and most of the changes from Beta to production are really just bug fixes and not changes in the look, feel, and functionality of the product. But this is not to guarantee that changes won't be included in the final release.  <br /> <br />The biggest change I can see in ASP.NET 2.0 is on their approach to eliminate much of the intense coding that ASP.NET required. ASP.NET was quite verbose - doing a program was rather like writing War and Peace, and you had better be exactly right in your spelling, grammer, and punctuation. The goal was to reduce the amount of code needed by two thirds. And it appears that they've accomplished this.  <br /> <br />The next major point seems to be that ASP.NET is integrated more closely with the rest of .NET. You use Visual Studio 2005 to build any type of .NET component, including ASP.NET. When microsoft says Integrated Development Environment, they mean it. All of their applications are tied together, some loosely, some more tightly, and the indications are that in the future they will be much more tightly.  <br /> <br />All in all, this book is just what it says, a Beta Preview. It presumes some understanding of version 1, and tells you what's happening in version 2. It is amazing to see the amount of access and availability to resources within Microsoft that Mr. Evjen had to produce this book	2004-11-23

With Whiteout he has returned to his roots. Here at a small private pharmaceuticals company a canister of the Madoba-2 virus is missing. Obviously based on the real-life Ebola virus, this is pretty mean stuff.  <br /> <br />While this is an exciting mystery, you have to wonder about where this kind of reasearch is conducted. Would they really be doing this in Scotland? And the answer seems to come out - Yes.  <br /> <br />Only lately has the Department of Homeland Security taken over Plum Island in Long Island Sound from the control of the Department of Agriculture. Why would home security be interested in a USDA lab. Well it turns out that they've been doing some pretty heavy research into biological warfare stuff at Plum Island. (Do a Google search.)  <br /> <br />Mr. Follett's book is fiction (I hope) unfortunately it seems all to likely to be possible. Strange as it seems, there are people out there who don't like us.	2004-11-22

It includes everything from birch bark canoes to the latest commercial and military vessels, junks to dhows, clipper ships to cruise liners and boats built especially for the Americas cup. More than a coffee table book, the descriptions that go with the photographs enhance and explain the photographs.  <br /> <br />In the section on the First Boats, there are drawings amd photographs from both ancient times and modern. From here the story continues and reflects the leastest research. For instance: <br /> <br />There are thirteen photographs of the Vasa, the Swedish ship that rolled over and sank on its maiden voyage in 1628. As the book puts it, this was \\"the largest and most elaborately decorated flagship, Sweden's VASA sailed into this arena for a few minutes.\\" This is, of course the ship that was found and raised in 1961, teaching us a lot about 17th Century construction.   <br /> <br />Also included is the story of Zheng He, the Chinese explorer who made seven discovery voyages in the early 1400's covering some 35,000 miles.  <br /> <br />The drawing of the Hunley, the Confederate submarine reflect the latest discoveries made since it was found and raised only a few years ago. <br /> <br />All in all, this book is what you'd expect.

I think your answers are used to fill in the blanks in their word processing system.  <br /> <br />Now there are computer programs like this one that take a particular area of the law and produce the forms you need. This one is obviously oriented to wills (duh, look at the name), it includes legal wills, living trusts, health care directives (living wills) powers of attorney, final arrangements documents, and forms for executors.

Why this one?  <br /> <br />Four Reasons:  <br /> <br />One, this book is a great introduction to Photoshop. It has a unique indexing system where each heading begins with a picture showing what the about. Each chapter then starts with a sub-index, again illustrated so that you can see what the subject is about without having to know the meaning of the somewhat arcane words that the chapter is talking about. For instance there's a section on watermarking. What's watermarking - well it's a kind of translucent appearance, usually to type that you put on a picture that you want to identify somehow. They have a section on watermarking, but just below it is a picture with a watermark. You may not be familiar with the term, but you probably know the effect you are trying to create.  <br /> <br />Second, this book is the first I've seen that combines both the software with some hints about how to take pictures that you intend to modify with Photoshop. There are a lot of problems you can repair with photoshop, but if you make a simple adjustment to some of the settings on your camera you may save a lot of time and get a better result.  <br /> <br />Third is the CD contained with the book. This contains some 250 presets for Photoshop that are both quick and fast to use as well as having everything set so you don't forget to check some box. The results will make your work go a lot faster, at least initially while you are learning what you want.  <br /> <br />Fourth, as the owner of this book you are invited to watch an hour of video training on Photoshop.  <br /> <br />What more can I say?	2004-11-22

This new book is on using the AirPort to its maximum advantage.  <br /> <br />Glenn Fleishman edits blog on Wi-Fi, is a writer for the Seattle Times, TidBITS and InfoWorld, Macworld and the New York Times. He knows whereof he speaks. He also has a quick and easy writing style that conveys quite a bit of information almost painlessly. He is particularly good at explaining what appear to be the small details, but which really effect how successful the installation will be.  <br /> <br />I also liked his approach to securing the network. As time goes on, more and more people seem to get a kick out of hacking into networks, usually harmlessly, but not always. It's a lot easier to design in security from the beginning than it is to go back and try to implement it later.	2004-11-22

In hurricanes this year, in 1991's Perfect Storm, the tri-State Tornado in 1925, and the Children's Blizzard of 1888 nature showed what it can do. Of these disasters, the Children's Blizzard is the least well known. Finally we have a book that chronicles this incident.  <br /> <br />January 12, 1888 was a nice balmy day, the first after a fairly hard few weeks. Children went off to school without coats and gloves, farmers went out to work on projects they had been putting off.  <br /> <br />Then the cold front came through. In three minutes the temperature dropped 18 degrees. A vicious wind blowing heavy snow caused a whiteout that dropped visibility to near zero. By midnight the windhill was down to 40 below zero. By morning (Friday the thirteenth) some 500 people were dead, many of them children trying to get home from school.  <br /> <br />1888 was, by our standards, a primative time. There were certainly no satellite imagery put on television by the local weather forecaster. To be sure, there was some indication of a drop in temperature and snow at the weather forecasting office, but extremely limited communications prevented this warning from being widely circulated.  <br /> <br />Well researched, well written, this is a book for reading in front of the fire in a strongly built house (the storm ripped the roof off of many schools, exposing the inside to the full fury of the storm) maybe with a hot buttered rum at hand.	2004-11-22

Before that the Depression, before that the first War. Mixed in with all this there was the Jazz age, the big band era, and swing. But Elvis carved new territory. With a sound all his own, Elvis found a niche somewhere between where the black artists of the day were trying to go and the mainstream of popular/country/gospel.  <br /> <br />Untutored, Elvis was a natural showman. His hair, dress, and stage antics were enough to drive parents nuts, and to drive their kids straight to him. The onstage Elvis was a very different person than the private Elvis. And here, through interviews with the people who knew him best, by extensive use of the Graceland archives, and including more than a hundred images, many rarely seen before, is what may be the definitive biography.  <br /> <br />Ms. Keogh has managed to capture the magic of Elvis on stage with the private person. She sums up her book: \\"Elvis. He was generous, he was kind, he was rambunctious, and, at times lonely, but who among us is not? By any measure, he lived a ful life, and even today, he does not fail to live.\\"	2004-11-22

This obviously works great, or digital cameras wouldn't be as popular as they are today.  <br /> <br />The in-camera processing has to be written in a very general way to handle any situation. But there is an alternative way -- RAW data and Adobe Photoshop CS.  <br /> <br />Photoshop runs on your PC, either Mac or Windows, and your PC is a lot more powerful than the little processor embedded into your camera.  <br /> <br />Basically taking in data using the RAW format means that Photoshop is getting the raw data that came from the sensors in the camera (along with some other information) and doing that processing on your PC rather than in the camera.  <br /> <br />By definition the RAW data contains all the information that is available, it's the direct sensor output. This book is on taking the raw data into Photoshop and what you can do with it once it's there.	2004-11-22

There will long be arguments over which was the better plane. Very similar in size, design and performance, both planes were the state of the art of aircraft design when they met in late 1940. Both planes had a single low wing, a V-12 liquid cooled engine, and look very much alike. Which was the better plane, that's a subject calling for beer around a fireplace.  <br /> <br />This book will halp you in your discussions, on either side. 148 pages talk about the Spit. I can't say that evey possible variation was covered, but there are a lot of variations here that I never heard of including specialized recon, the Griffin engined models, and several versions of the SeaFire. Also well documented is the American use of the Spitfire. Some 272 machines were flown by the Americans.  <br /> <br />97 pages document the Messerschmitt. As with the Spit it begins with the early development and continues through the various versions to conclude with the after war production in Czechoslovakia and Spain.  <br /> <br />This book is certain to become a standard reference book on the two planes.	2004-11-21

We learned too late in places like Germany, Japan and Viet Nam. I've got to say that I don't know the answer, but I read books like this one to try to get a better understanding.  <br /> <br />The reporting in this book of Osama bin Laden seems to have a ring of truth. The answers he comes up with don't ring quite so loudly. And sooner or later bin Laden will be killed or captured. What will happen then? Is he the only Muslim leader? Who will replace him, or will the movement fall apart into infighting?  <br /> <br />How much of this whole problem is religion based, how much oil based? If it's just oil; simple, big taxes on oil guzzlers, reinstate the CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) rules for improving the fleet mileage (The Republicans don't want to do it because the car companies want to produce Hummers and Excursions. The Democrats don't want to do it because the auto workers unions don't want a slow down in production.) But politically this is going to be difficult - a recent poll says that 75% of the people think that high gasoline prices are the fault of the oil companies, completely unaware of the fact that China and India are beginning to import lots more oil.  <br /> <br />If this is truly a clash of civilizations (Huntington's book title) then we have bigger problems. Are we going to go back to the crusades? And in this kind of situation, the more prople you kill the more dedicated enemies you make.  <br /> <br />Mr. Anonymous presents some interesting facts.

When you first open this book you can't help but turn to those shows that have become your favorites. I first turned to Gypsy, then Evita, Phantom, Cats, and on and on. All my favorites were there. Most of them, showed the original cast from the first production.  <br /> <br />Gypsy featured Ethel Merman as Mama Rose, Sandra Church as Louise/Gypsy in the original production. The book then goes on to other Rose's: Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Bernadette Peters. In each case it talks about the unique characterizations brought to the stage by the leading lady.  <br /> <br />This is typical treatment for this book where most of the plays (the really popular ones) get similar treatment. In addition there are side bars that give details on some of the other people (directors, composers, custome people, etc.) that have made these shows what they are.  <br /> <br />There's only one problem with the book, you can't put it down. I know, I've tried, and somehow it falls open to My Fair Lady....	2004-11-21

I don't know if that makes it a book or a magazine. At any rate, for the current edition, there are several long illustrated articles that cover some very interesting points.  <br /> <br />The big multi-page articles in this edition include about forty pages on the Su-27/30 family of Russian fighters. There's fifteen pages on the Boeing B-52, including several drawings of the initial proposal aircraft that were submitted while the Air Force decided on turboprops vs. turbojet.  <br /> <br />For the nostalgia minded there's a long (35 page) article on the deHavilland Mosquito, showing more variations than I ever thought existed.  <br /> <br />This is a beautifully done, splendid book with enough variations in content to please any aviation buff.	2004-11-21

Some schools use it heavily, some treat it more as a formality. At any case, if you are planning on grad school, it's probably something you have to do. The testing will take three hours.  <br /> <br />This book, just out with a 2005 edition is based on many years of monitoring the test. While the actual questions are copyrighted and not released, questions that are very similar to the actual tests can be made up and used for practice. In addition, comments on strategy and test taking techniques can be of great help.  <br /> <br />There are three parts to the test, Math, Verbal and Analytical Writing. This book has three major parts, one each for of the three test parts. Each part of the book has a description of the test, some hints and tips that have been frequently helpful in the actual testing, some study guide information, some sample questions to illustrate what they are talking about. Finally there's a CD-ROM included with the book. This has a practice test designed to be as much like a real GRE as possible.  <br /> <br />It is often said that you can't practice for the GRE, that you should just go into it and do your best. This would be true if this were an intelligence test, but it isn't. It's just another standardized test. And you can certainly learn more about how to take a standardized test.	2004-11-20

That way you get the low down on things like the quality of life, cafeteria food, social life, political leaning, all in all some 60 categories. That's in addition, of course to the standard information that you'd get from the school itself like admissions criteria, deadlines, phone numbers etc.  <br /> <br />You've got to enjoy some of the categories in which colleges are ranked:  <br /> <br />Under Politics:  <br />Students Most Nostalgic for Ronald Reagan  <br />Students Most Nostalgic for Bill Clinton  <br />Students Most Politically Active  <br />Election? What Election?  <br /> <br />Under Food: <br />Great Campus Food  <br />Is This Food?  <br /> <br />I'm not quite sure just how they picked 357 colleges (.357 Magnum Perhaps) instead of 358 or 401, but you gotta stop somewhere.  <br /> <br />Easily one of the best college reference books.	2004-11-20

I spend most of my life re-doing old code that for some reason needs to be expanded, changed, fixed or whatever. The old story about writing the program is only 10% of the effort, (really it may be 2%) is true. If you could double the time spent writing the program itself it would be well worth it (if the world would let you). Wouldn't it be nice to have programs that - without work on your part - could exmanine itself and then change to do something else depending on what it finds.  <br /> <br />Reflection won't take twice as long to code. But it will a bit take longer in the design phase. Nor can reflection promise to do everything that the salesmen can promise to the new prospects, nothing can do that.  <br /> <br />Reflection is a technique that can be of great value in some instances, it's ceratinly something you need to have in your mental toolbox.  <br /> <br />This book is by one of the pioneers in reflection, and his son who uses reflection to solve day-to-day problems.	2004-11-20

Apple And Macintosh Graphics And Sound, Computer Animation, This is the official Apple Pro training course for DVD Studio Pro 3, so it's clear that this is the book you need to get. The nice thing about is that it's also very well written. If you have the earlier versions of this guide, you'll know what I mean.  <br /> <br />The approach used in the book is to go produce DVD's. In fact after just a few pages of introductory this is what we're going to do stuff, you get started making a DVD. The first DVD is planned to take about one hour to make, it includes getting started with learning your way around the Studio Pro authoring window, making a title page and a simple menu. At the end of the hour you should have a burned DVD ready to play.  <br /> <br />Having hit the ground running, from here the projects get more and more complex, and in each DVD you have to repeat some of the steps of the earlier one, this kind of repetition makes it familiar. By the end of the fourth project you've used basically all of DVD Studio Pro.  <br /> <br />The format of this book is a directed hands-on tutorial. It's neither a cram for the test nor a general reference manual. But after working through the course material in this book, you can become a certified Apple Pro by taking the certification exam. You will have been exposed to and practiced everything you need to know.	2004-11-20

Suppose you were looking to hire someone for your help desk. You narrow it down to the final two candidates You ask them how well they know Windows XP. One says, \\"I know it pretty well.\\" The other says, \\"I'm a Microsoft Certified Desktop Support Technician on Windows XP.\\" Which would you hire?  <br /> <br />That's not to say that the first candidate wouldn't do a fine job for you. But it is to say that the second candidate will give you a higher feeling of confidence. To make yourself be the second candidate is the only reason for taking this test.  <br /> <br />Oh, one thing more, besides just taking it, you need to pass it. And that is the reason for having this book. It will help you pass the test.  <br /> <br />The contents of the book are just about what you'd expect: everything you need to know to support end users running (or trying to run XP). Among everything else this includes: installing, setting up users and groups, understanding file and folder access, installing and managing hardware (display, I/O, storage, printers), networking, accessing the internet. And each of these subjects is the subject of a chapter in the book.  <br /> <br />And because this is a training kit for the test, it has extensive review questions and a CD with additional questions and information. Finally this kit will give you a 15% discount in the cost of the test.	2004-11-19

And these have come about more by chance than by planning. In their time the marketing managers of these companies were just trying to establish next quarters sales.  <br /> <br />This is one of the first books I've seen that approaches branding from a view of this kind of permanence, this kind of cultural approach. Most clear is the message that following trends can never build an iconic brand.  <br /> <br />I'm not so sure that todays management, focused on this quarter, and maybe next is really ready for thinking about forming a brand that will endure for generations. Yet you do see companies with the kind of foresight to do just that. When Microsoft went into Russia, they went in with the view to establish their brand as the defacto standard. The immediate profits were basically ignored, but next year, and the year after that....  <br /> <br />This is a book that has to get above the marketing manager, the CEO needs to provide the direction to say that we want to be the next Klenex.	2004-11-19

This book is for those folk to have to actually make whatever it is happen.  <br /> <br />In order to be functional with a large number of programs, Windows has to present a standardized interface to the programs that are going to run and actually do the desired work. This interface is called the Microsoft Windows Application Programming Interface or API. These API are how the programs tell the operating system to send/get data to/from the disk, how to handle errors, manage memory and processes, in short, how to interface to Windows so that Windows can handle the actual hardware.  <br /> <br />In this new edition new features of Windows XP, 2000 and 20003 and Win 64 are covered. The Windows 9x series is touched upon but slightly as these versions are no longer being shipped.  The biggest new area is the enhanced coverage of threads and synchronization. To get much out of this book, a knowledge of C programming is needed.	2004-11-19

This book rightfully points out that there were warning signs aplenty. But what does this really say of the future.  <br /> <br />So I first turned to Chapter 10, Future Predictable Surprises. I have to admit, I was surprised. Their entries in this category: Campaign-Finance Reform; Auditor Independence; Global Depletion of Fish Stocks; Government Subsidies, particularly in agriculture; Global Warming; Ignoring Future Financial Obligations, medicaid, medicare, social security; Frequent Flyer Miles. Yup, those are all predictable disasters.  <br /> <br />And if you brainstorm a while you can come up with a bunch of other predictable disasters: AIDS, Oil Running Out, Terriorists hitting a nuclear plant, or bombing the Old River Control Project in Louisiana, which would leave New Orleans and the hundreds of petro-chemical plants downstream high and dry, let along killing 15,000 or so people along the Atchafalaya river.  <br /> <br />Then I got to thinking a bit further. It's not the specific disasters that they want to warn us of, that's our job. Their job is to discuss how to look at disasters and what to do to protect our companies or investments (sell petrochemicals). And at this they do a good job.	2004-11-19

The attorneys have this more or less standard form on their computers, they will fill in the blanks and send it in for you.\\" \\"Or,\\" he continued, \\"I have a book here that tells you how to do it yourself.\\" I asked if anyone using his book had ever had any trouble. \\"No,\\" he answered.  <br /> <br />He pulled out this book. Someone had already ripped off the CD that came with it. I could type the forms in the book into my computer, instead I went across the street to the bookstore. Twenty bucks saved a lot of typing.  <br /> <br />It's certainly not the most interesting book I've read, but $20 rather than $600. What more can I say?	2004-11-19

First came Rick Atkinson's excellent An Army at Dawn that talked about the birth of the American Army in North Africa. Now Ms. Tomblin's excellent companion on the Naval Operations.  <br /> <br />It was in the Med that the Army and the Navy won their spurs. Although opposed by the American brass, the operations in the Med tought the Army and the Navy vital lessons that would have doomed the cross channel invasion pushed by American leaders for 1942 (Operation Sledgehammer) or 1943 (Operation RoundUp) at the latest.  <br /> <br />It was in the Med that the US Army learned the importance of close air support (instead of the strategic long range favored by the Army Air Force). It was in the Med that the Army and the Navy really learned what years of neglect in fielding new equipment would really cost in lives. It was in the Med that the Navy really learned about amphibious operations that would later pay dividends in both the Pacific and the coast of France (both at Overloard and at Dragoon on the southern coast).  <br /> <br />Ms Tomblin has done a truly supurb job of researching both the official documents and talking to the veterans from the Med to put together what will probably be the definitive book on naval operations in the Med.	2004-11-19

The television news lambasted game playing to a fair the well. The games were going to rot the brains of the kids. I suppose that the television networks wanted the kids sitting passively in front of the tube watching the afternoon drivel.  <br /> <br />Game playing teaches a desire to win. Game players have learned about measured risk taking, have an amazing ability to multitask, and have unexpected leadership skills. Sound familiar, these are exactly the traits a lot of business books are saying that we need to seek in new employees.  <br /> <br />Ok, so it isn't what we did when we were kids. But some kids still play sports (and games); some kids didn't play sports when we were little either, girls especially weren't allowed. But what we did drove our parents just as wild, remember their thoughts about Elvis.  <br /> <br />This book is based on a series of surveys of the hiring experiences of companies to explore how gamers are different as employees, as managers, and as executives and what managers, made up of mostly Baby Boomers, need to do in order to capitalize on gamers strengths and hidden potential.  <br /> <br />And just think, if you were trying to hire kids to learn to drive a tank....	2004-11-19

It was a young lady, well she sounded like a young lady, and I like to talk to young ladies. Since they were going to have people in my neighborhood anyway (in my small town, if they're in town at all they're in my neighborhood), why didn't they come by and install a free satellite TV receiver. We chatted and chatted, it was a delightful conversation (at my advanced age I don't get to chat with many young ladies). Then when I asked her if she would give me a free TV set because I didn't have a TV, she didn't want to talk to me any more.  <br /> <br />I then went back to the book. Lo and behold, the basic thesis of the book is \\"don't call prospects at random, only call those who are predisposed to buy from you.\\" If the young lady on the phone had done just a little bit of qualifying - \\"Do you have a TV?\\" - she would have saved a lot of her time.  <br /> <br />The book is filled with good common sense advice on how to narrow down the suspects into real prospects. It's the good old fashioned basics of how to sell.  <br /> <br />If we could give a copy of this book to all the people who call, we could eliminate an awful lot of wasted phone calls.  <br /> <br />But then I wouldn't get to talk to the nice lady who wanted to give me a free satellite dish. If I only knew her number I'd call her back and talk to her some more.	2004-11-19

One day the Government came in and said, \\"You've got to sell your business and move out of town - you've got 48 hours.\\" A few days later they were indeed out of town, in an interment camp in southern Idaho with guards carrying Tommy guns walking around the barbed wire enclosure. A few years later he was let out of the camp, then he was drafted into the Army. His younger brother enlisted in the Army to get out of the camp, was sent to Italy with the famed 442, and was shot.  <br /> <br />This is one of those books that you need to read. Perhaps like you need to read some Michael Moore, just to see what the groups at the far ends of the bell curve on both sides are thinking.  <br /> <br />I wonder if Ms Malkin really believes what she is saying, or if she has just written a book designed to create controversy. The book is supposed to make a case for racial profiling in the War on Terror. But most of it is an attempt to justify the World War II Japanese-American 'relocation.' She spends a lot of time on a Japanese 'threat' of espionage on the West Coast. Strangely she says little about any real espionage on either the West Coast or Hawaii which never had any serious problems (after Pearl Harbour). Yes there was spying in Hawaii, but it was from the Japanese consulate - a legitimate use of consulates, just as we use ours now.  <br /> <br />Profiling on the basis of appearance is dangerous.

It's updated to cover the Pentium 4 and has a little bit on the AMD Opteron which is making very strong inroads in the high performance clustered supercomputer business. There's also a fair amount on the MIPS processor. (One of the authors was a cofounder of MIPS.) <br /> <br />This book is aimed at the intersection of the true hardware types and the low level software types. As such, it's guaranteed not to be deep enough in either area to satisfy all. But to the hardware type thinking in bits and discrete logic the programming aspects will be a good help. Likewise to the software type, learning what registers really do, and what's pipelining, will be a great help.  <br /> <br />Chapter 9, potentially the most interesting, is on clusters. This chapter is on the CD, not in the book itself.	2004-11-19

And this series by Sara Donati has them all.  <br /> <br />First it helps to have an interesting setting. This series begins in the time just after the American Revolutionary War. This latest volume starts in 1812, at a time we know the next war is about to begin, but of course the characters don't know about it yet.  <br /> <br />Second the characters have to be interesting and believable. This is particularly important in a series, because if you don't care about them, why bother with the next book. The Bonner family, living in the wilderness (upstate New York) certainly is an interesting set of people. Big enough to have a range of different types, small enough that you can get to know everyone.  <br /> <br />Third, a time of war is good. We know the war is coming, the characters don't. We know that the war is comming to their particular little area. We know that the young men will feel the urge to march to the sound of the drums.  <br /> <br />Fourth, there has to be good writing. The critics, the readers all say that Sara Donati does a great job here. For what it's worth, I agree.	2004-11-19

Most programming efforts in the college/university level are really short and quick, while most software projects in the real world are much bigger. Combining all this together you have the potential for turning out graduates that have a hard time in the real world.  <br /> <br />An interesting point of this book is its overall design, which is laid out like a software project. That way you are working within the broad concepts while you don't even know that you are being exposed to them.  <br /> <br />This is not a book on programming. You should know at least one object oriented language before beginning it. Java is used for most examples, but one of the C's or Python could be used.  <br /> <br />The title of the book is somewhat misleading to me. True it is about UML and Patterns, but it's really the sub-title that tells the story. This is a book on object oriented analysis and design (OOAD). UML and Patterns are simply two of the tools used to teach OOAD.	2004-11-19

If anyone wanted to do a denial of service attack on my web site, or was really interested in coming in -- well, why would they care. But the Microsoft site, if you could bring it down you would certainly have bragging rights in certain circles.  <br /> <br />So if you really want to know about security, who better to read than people responsible for keeping the Microsoft site up and running.  <br /> <br />The book has four major sections:  <br /> <br />Planning and Performing Security assessments  <br />Penetration Testing for Nonintrusive Attacks  <br />Penetration Testing for Instrusive Attacks  <br />Security Assessment Case Studies.  <br /> <br />One thing I really appreciate in this book is the little stories from the real world. In between the description and tutorials (this is computer stuff, it's pretty dry) there are little notes of what really happened in a situation where this particular area was being tested. It gives the book the ring of truth, the sound of experience.  <br /> <br />Highly Recommended.	2004-11-18

The hardware wouldn't do it, the software wouldn't do it, and for a system that was primarily something you used for personal use on your desktop it really didn't matter much. You probably turned it off each evening anyway.  <br /> <br />But those times have changed. The modern PC is a PC in name only. Put in a couple of high speed Pentium 4's or Opterons and you have a system more powerful than those running airline reservations systems a few years back. Add the web and e-commerce and you have systems that you really don't want to go down at all. Now you are into the realm of High Availability or since this is the computer industry - HA.  <br /> <br />Microsoft, in the past was not too concerned with HA. If you wanted HA you had to go Unix. But in recent years Microsoft has developed Cluster Services for both the operating system and SQL Server along with other technologies to enable HA.  <br /> <br />This book is divided into three main sections:  <br /> <br />Understanding High Availability  <br />Choosing the Right High Availability Approaches  <br />Implementing High Availability.  <br /> <br />In summary, this book is HA the Microsoft Way.	2004-11-18

Way back in the days when Microsoft Access was the latest thing in databases (and the earth was flat, and it was three miles to school, uphill both directions) it included quite a nice report generating package.  <br /> <br />Then we all moved to higher performance data bases, and we lost that functionality unless we bought a separate package like Crystal Reports.  <br /> <br />Now Microsoft has given us that functionality back and in an expanded manner that incorporates a lot of web presentation capability.  <br /> <br />This book is on the capabilities of the reporting system now built into SQL Server. If you're familiar with other graphically based reporting systems, or if you've worked in a .NET environment, you should be able to read this book in an afternoon and begin doing reports.  <br /> <br />After your first few reports you'll find that you want to go back to check on fancier capabilities, but you'll have the basics down.  <br /> <br />The nice thing about this book is that it was written while the authors were in the process of converting some 200 reports to actually use the software. That way you find out how it really works as opposed to the way the manuals say. Good job.	2004-11-18

And the efforts that the television networks go to display all manner of statistical information without totally blocking the play of the game is amazing.  <br /> <br />But where do those comments from the announcers like 'odds,' 'likely,' and 'no chance' come from. The announcers certainly don't explain. But in this book professor of mathematics Ken Ross has written a guide to the science of probability for baseball fans. As a baseball fan of many years, he can cut to the essence of the matter, bringing a rigorous  analysis that is slated in baseball terms, not mathematical.  <br /> <br />There are a lot of numbers here. You don't need to be a mathematician, but you'd better not be afraid to look at numbers and some simple algebra.	2004-11-18

This book, based on the June 2004 beta level software, gives you the first detailed look at the new features coming in SQL Server 2005. While some features are likely to change before the final software is released, the broad view as given here is likely to remain pretty fixed. By this stage in the development of the new version, these points are well along.  <br /> <br />This book does not pretend to be a book on SQL Server, it is intended for the knowledgeable SQL Server user and covers only those points that have been changed for the new version.  <br /> <br />From what I can see, the big changes in 2005 are in Security, XML processing, and mirroring. Most of the other things, a few additions to T-SQL, some enhancement of notification and reporting services are included. Then again, I'm looking at it from what I do, you may find that you consider other features to be the most important. Knowing what those are is what this book is all about.  <br /> <br />It's certainly a timely book, now is when you need to start planning for the new release.	2004-11-18

But how often do you really go to the help screens?  <br /> <br />Here are a bunch (I didn't count them) of useful little hints and tips that will help you move up a step in the competence department. The book is aimed at (in my opinion) someone who is just a step up from being an absolute beginner. Someone who has started working with .NET and learned the basics can get the most out of this book. It isn't a book that starts out with \\"This is the Visual Studio IDE.\\" Instead it starts out \\"When you are using the IDE, sometimes it is helpful if....\\"  <br /> <br />This book is said to be aimed at the Beginner-Intermediate level. I agree. If you know everything that's in this book you aren't one of them. Good Job.	2004-11-18

Adam Lucas, the publisher, has written this book on a remarkable man having a remarkable year.  <br /> <br />This is the story of Roy Williams leaving a very successful stint at Kansas and returning to UNC. He was faced with a group of very talented but moody individuals into a winning team that could compete at the highest level of NCAA competition - the Atlantic Coast Conference.  <br /> <br />No one player is good enough to win at that level, it takes team effort. And building that team effort is what it's all about. It's something that only the very best coaches can do. And he did it. Here's the detail.	2004-11-18

You had a bunch of pages, and like magic you could hyper-link to an entirely different page. Then it made a lot of sense to back the web site with a database. That way a standard page could pull up different data as needed. Kind of like this page, where the book title and description changes within a standard template.  <br /> <br />Then came web services companies that supply some particular kind of service. The first of these (or at least the first that most of us got exposed to) were companies that checked, authorized and/or billed credit cards so we could do e-commerce. The companies in this business established standards. And now the world has established standards for such service oriented architectures (SOA). As of the moment the world doesn't quite agree on what these standards should be. Two of the standards are incorporated in IBM's Websphere, and the J2EE.  <br /> <br />This book is on the Microsoft version on the way it should be done, called Web Services Enhancements or WSE and specifically the 2.0 version. If this is what you are thinking of using, or have been directed to use, this book provides a great introduction to the Microsoft approach. It a beginners book so far as SOA/WSE is concerned, but you should have some experience in .NET and in programming.	2004-11-18

While this is the story of one year in the life of one farm, it is really more than that. It is the story of how food gets grown and delivered to the table. Their Fat Rooster Farm is small, only twenty acres is operated organically and produces enough food to feed the family and to have a surplus to sell for admittedly subsistance income.  <br /> <br />The story begins with searching for a farm, buying it and learning to be a farmer. It was not an easy task, farming never is. And when you have regular off farm jobs, have never farmed before, and are starting out organically you learn from mistakes. Mistakes cost time, effort and money. But they made it. And when the year was past, the next year began and it continues.	2004-11-18

The screen persona, the voice, all are well known.  <br /> <br />Much less well known is his private life: his eleven year 'relationship' with Randolph Scott, his five marriages, a 10-year LSD habit, alleged suicide attempts and connections to the FBI. Beyond this, he was a brilliant actor whose elegant charm lives on. He came to Hollywood just at the end of the studio-run star system and was instrumental in challenging the system. He became enough of a star that he could ignore the studios, paving the way for the actors that followed. (Probably because of this he never got an Oscar for any of his films.) ased on four years of research, this is certain to become the definitive Cary Grant biography.	2004-11-18

How strong a winch do you need to pull the two ton truck up the hill? When you are pushing on the truck while being eaten by bugs, I don't know I'd think much about the simple trig problem. Or, in a horse race, from how far behind can a horse catch and pass the leading horse?  <br /> <br />Dr. Mazur loves mathematics, math for itself, math just for its elegance. And he brings it across in this book. I can remember in my own math studies when I first got to differential calculus. It was like new worlds opening. It was like what other people tell me about the first time they heard Beethoven's Fifth.  <br /> <br />What I could never have done was bring out the excitement, the fascination, the love that Dr. Mazur does in this book.	2004-11-18

And with all the recent news reports concentrating on Iraq and the election, any mention of the space program has been relegated to the very back pages, if it's there at all.  <br /> <br />This book presents a fly-on-the-wall approach to 16 months of NASA history - February 1, 2003 to June 2, 2004. This period may prove to be a most important turning point in NASA history. This is the time from the Columbia disaster to the release of the Presidential Commission report on Moon, Mars, and Beyond.  <br /> <br />One surprising point to me was the depth and detail to which George W. Bush himself was involved. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I just can't see Clinton getting involved in something like this. Bush chose a long time family friend to head up NASA with instruction to clean up NASA's act.  <br /> <br />A note says: This book was written with the full cooperation of MASA and the Bush administration, but has not been and will not be reviewed by them or pre-approved in any way. The book does praise the Bush administration and some people will say that it unfairly handles the previous one. In my mind, that's what books are for. Let these authors express their opinions. Let someone else praise the other guys. I'll then read both books and decide for myself.  <br /> <br />The book has it's own web site which promises updates to the book. I'd really like to hear what NASA and the administration are saying about Burt Rutan and Space Ship One. This project was done for something like $20 million. NASA couldn't have written the plans for that much. What are they really saying behind closed doors?	2004-11-17

For centuries the only way to get multiple copies of something was to copy them by hand. We have the image of monks in their little cells painstakingly copying books, the Bible mainly. This lead to the whole concept of you don't need to read the Bible, the priest will do it for you - after all, we only have one copy.  <br /> <br />The next big invention was from Gutenberg. (This was also the last big invention according to the folk at the Gutenberg museum in Mainz, Germany.) But immediately people began thinking of how to make a quick copy. James Watt in the late 1770's marketed a type of copier. As this book points out in its historical section, various kinds of copiers in various stages of sophistication were invented through the years.  <br /> <br />Then came Chester Carlson. He was to spend all of his life working on the copying process. A Cal Tech physics graduate, he learned a big about the effect light had on semi-conductors and from this he spent his life on the process.  <br /> <br />Chester Carlson spent years developing, finding a company to work with, then setting up the production of copying machines using his technology.  <br /> <br />Although most of the time in this book is spent on Chester Carlson, no less important to the story of the copier is Joseph c. Wilson, the president of Haloid company. He literally bet his company on making this invention work. Needless to say, his company, renamed Xerox, became a success.  <br /> <br />Splendid book.	2004-11-17

Elmer Renner was a college graduate when he entered the Navy in 1943, sixty years ago. I am thankful that he was able to tell this story. It is a story of survival at sea. <br /> <br />More than that it is a story of a Navy capable of what can only be called gross incompetance. Renner was aboard the 130 wooden hulled minesweeper YMS-472. Designed for work in coastal areas the YMS-472 sailed across the Pacific Ocean to Okinawa. With a typhoon forecast, the YMS-472 was sent to sea to ride out the storm. The shallow draft vessel capsized in what is known as one of the worst storms ever. Renner and eight others managed to ride out the storm on a life raft. The Navy searched for a while, then called off the effort (why with the war over and plenty of ships and planes available). Days later, days without food or water, they happened to be spotted by a Corsair that radioed for help.  <br /> <br />This is a story of ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances. Mr. Renner says that it was good for him to tell the story rather than keep it inside himself. It is good for the rest of us also.	2004-11-17

The result is a surplus of books on the digital signal processing chips and programming techniques.  <br /> <br />In the real world you have a signal and you need it digitized, or you have some digital data and you need a real life signal that you can send out somewhere. The real world refuses to become digital, its analog.  <br /> <br />The literature on how to do this aspect has been sparse. And most of what does exist is in the form of a book by many authors. Their different writing style, different assumptions on the background of the readers and the inevitable disconnects between chapters make a consistent flow impossible.  <br /> <br />In this book Dr. Temes, a professor at Oregon State brings a solid theoretical background to the writing. Dr. Schreier, a senior design engineer at Analog Devices brings an understanding of what is possible today. Both men have a wealth of experience in the subject and an ability to convey their experience and knowledge to the reader.	2004-11-17

Minute after minute, after minute the credits flow. After the first few, the names are not of actors but of programmers and other computer types. This is typical of a lot of movies today. The computer people can produce special effects with greater attention to detail, more 'lifelike' appearance than previous techniques and can do it faster and at lower cost.  <br /> <br />And one of the main packages used for this work is Softimage. Strangely enough there are relatively few books on working with Softimage. This book covers the latest XSI 4 version of the software.  <br /> <br />The two authors are Aaron Sims who has done creatures for such films as Men in Black, and Michael Isner the head of Special Projects at Softimage. Mr. Sims handles the creative aspects of the book, going through the process of designing a character in a step-by-stem mode. Mr. Isner provides a solid base of information about the technical processes within XSI, information vital to a complete understanding of this powerful software package.  <br /> <br />The two authors have split the work well giving two views of approaching a problem.	2004-11-17

You publish nineteen books because you've developed a legion of fans that like your work.  <br /> <br />This book will not dissappoint her fans. It's about a book. Of course there's a murder. The victim is on a train that will soon land him at Gate A-8 and, moments later at St. Peter's Gate. The problem is that the victim is a former mob hit man, government informer, and perhaps masterminded a top-secret assignment abroad for a very-high-profile Capitol Hill client. And what's in the book he helped write?  <br /> <br />Enough already - Go read the book. You can be sure that the waves from the murder will reach strange places in the halls of Government, the intelligence agencies, the White House and more.

This time it's a serial killer who is going around a dark and somewhat frightening London finding young women to strangle.  <br /> <br />I could go with the story line, but you know what it is. It's the classic tale, well told with new twists, wrinkles and a most interesting set of characters.  <br /> <br />Ms. Rendell is a master story teller. To be successful, the story can't just be of murder. It uses murder as a central theme, but is really abut a slice of life. It's about characters you'd like to meet, then again, quite likely you know most of them already.  <br /> <br />There's a reason that she can get fifty books published, and after reading this one you'll understand.	2004-11-17

The pages are treated rather like a profusely illustrated newspaper. The illustrations are fantastic. Some occupy a full page, even more. Most are small and serve to illustrate just the little point being discussed. For instance in the section on Society, there is a sub-section on Social Structures. Under that you will find government types. Finally one one page you will find three discussions of Monarchies (3 pictures), Theocracies (1) and Military States (4). It's enough, like an expanded dictionary to tell you about all of these, but does not go into much depth. If it did, it would have to be many times larger, and it's already a big book.  <br /> <br />This is an absolutely fascinating book.

No longer young, she and her husband were imprisoned by the Japanese during World War II. During the imprisonment Lilla dreamed of food. In her mind she composed a cookbook. A cookbook that is today in the Imperial War Museum in London. It's a cookbook of traditional foods, of oriental foods, a cookbook of dreams to replace the starvation in the camp.  <br /> <br />The book is a biography of Lilla, but more than that it is a picture of a time long past that is forever gone. Besides the cookbook and family records, Ms. Osborne draws on newspaper clippings and other historical information to give a picture of life in those times, in those places. It makes for fascinating reading.	2004-11-17

In fact, you'll probably spend more than going down to WalMart or CostCo. But when you build your own, you know what you're getting.   <br /> <br />I want a system with a lot of disk performance and memory to do the jobs I ask of it. The only video I need is enough to get the operating system to load, and I usually don't even connect speakers. A heavy duty gamer needs lots more video power, and may want a sophisticated sound card as well. The WalMart/CostCo systems are designed to fit everybody, so they really fit only Mr. Average.  <br /> <br />The first thing I did when I got this new 4th Edition was turn to the chapter on building a system using the Athlon 64. Mr. rosenthal was right on the money. He ordered a cheap case, and then immediately replaced the cheap power supply with something heavier duty. He then used an Asus motherboard, again first rate, although (I think) more expensive than some others just as good but with a less valuable name.  <br /> <br />One minor complaint - I'd like to see some recommendations on brand names. What brand of Power Supply did he use - why? What about a reference list for mainboards, or a web site that would give recommendations? And while I'd hate to see him create a firestorm, how about an Intel/AMD comparison.  <br /> <br />Finally we need another addition. How do you build a dual processor Opteron? I can't afford one, but I'd like to dream. And of course there will need to be a sixth edition with the new dual processor cores that are coming.	2004-11-17

Tax Liens are an interesting form of investment. Basically the city or county (usually)charges property taxes on every identifiable piece of property in their jurisdiction. Sometimes the property holder is late in paying his taxes. The city or county then puts a lien on the property. They may, however, need their money now (the police department payroll needs paying or something like that). So they sell the lien at a discount (charging penalties to make up the discount amount). When the taxes are paid the lien is bought back at face value. Simple.  <br /> <br />Of course the devil is in the details. And the book is on the details. What's the difference, for instance in a tax lien state and a tax deed state? What are the risks and how do you avoid them? What are the details of the bidding process?  Mr. Loftis is an attorney with many years of experience investing in tax delinquent properties. In this book he discusses the concepts and his experience.	2004-11-17

At the same time there are issues being raised about the moral/ethical issues involved in doing any research at all on the cells.  <br /> <br />This book is really two or perhaps three books in one. Ms. Parson spends most of the time giving an excellent report on stem cells. Their history, the current research and the potential. The second point discusses the legal aspects of culling the cells and reproducing them. Finally she talks about the moral/ethical issues. I'm sure that her treatment of these issues will be enough to offend a lot of people, but it seems fair and straigforward to me.  <br /> <br />Adding interest to the book is the recent vote in California to spend a huge amount on stem cell research to establish California as a home for the huge business opportunities that people believe will result.  <br /> <br />One thing is certain, regardless of the legal/moral/ethical issues, stem cell research is going to continue. It may not be done in the US, but it will certainly be done in China, Japan, Finland, Sweden, UK, Korea, Greece, Singapore and other countries.	2004-11-17

And I've been all over the four corners area.  In the Charlie Moon mysteries, the action is in South Western Colorado, an area I know particularly well. And the tone of the book reflects well on the area.  <br /> <br />The mystery tales spun by Mr. Doss are all you could want of a good mystery. The clues are there, the seemingly unconnected incidents that are creating all kinds of confusion and uproar will all come together in the end. But you knew that, this is the essence of any mystery.  <br /> <br />The story is very well told. The characters are not supermen, they have flaws. In between is a good dose of humor. The plot is full of twists and turns, blind alleys and mis-directions so you wonder just how Charlie Moon is going to pull it off.  <br /> <br />It's kind of like Tony Hillerman but with the Ute's instead of the Navaho. It's also without the mystical aspects, which makes for a story that I happen to like better.	2004-11-17

An awful lot of computer books seem to leave out the first forty pages that should give you an introduction of just what it is that we are trying to do with this piece of hardware or software. This whole book, all 768 pages of it can be considered the first forty pages of any Cisco or Networking book that you might otherwise want to read.  <br /> <br />This book talks about the internet, not about how to surf to a web page, but about the underlying structure - the backbone, the protocols, the way a message gets from here to there and back. The orientation is, as you might guess from the title, towards Cisco equipment. But I doubt that there are very many ISPs that don't have at least one Cisco box.  <br /> <br />The book covers the Cisco philosophy on routers, switches, quality of service, security, wireless, content delivery, protocols, network management, network design, and finally even how to troubleshoot Cisco networks.  <br /> <br />This is not a manual or certification cram guide for say the Cisco 12000 series router. This is the first forty pages of the manual on those products. And after reading the first forty pages, you might know if you need a Series 12000, or a Series 800. You'll at least be able to understand the manuals on these pieces of equipment.  <br /> <br />Excellent book. I'd like to see the same thing on PC's, mainframes, clustering, and on and on.	2004-11-17

This is the story of the first years of a young doctor. She certainly picked places where she would learn a lot. A year at a clinic in Swaziland would have to be educational to anyone. Through the whole book there is a tone of really caring for patients but in many cases of being not able to help.  <br /> <br />The theme of the book, learned by Dr. Young after many trying experiences is that the best source of information is the patient. The problem is that you have to learn to listen and make sense out of what the patient says. Sometimes that is difficult. Sometimes that is what the doctor has to learn.  <br /> <br />I think she would be a good doctor to have as your bedside.	2004-11-17

Basically it's on the SQL programming language (Yes, Martha, it's a language).  <br /> <br />On the one hand it is aimed at the IBM i5/iSeries developers the tools they need to effectively use SQL in their applications.  <br /> <br />On the other hand it is equally aimed at the experienced SQL programmer that is now moving to the i5/iSeries who needs to know the particular twists and kinks in the implementation as well as the tools available on the system to support development.  <br /> <br />It's clear the future of data base interaction lies in SQL. It's also clear that without a book on the specific dialect of SQL spoken by the particular version you are running you can't write effective code. The structure of each data base engine is just a bit different. I don't believe that any of them meet the full standard.  <br /> <br />This is a novice to Intermediate level book. It starts with the simple SELECT statement and goes through JOINS, UNIONS, Sub-Selects, enough that the user can probably do what he wants. The book spends a good bit of time on converting from the older DDS/RPG based software.  <br /> <br />This book is an excellent start. It's hand's on enough to make sense, detailed enough to get you through the first through months of work before you're ready to tie into the details of advanced SQL -- Let alone the always coming next version.	2004-11-16

And with increased transportation and communications the business world is changing faster than it ever has before. With changes of this magnitude and frequency, it is likely that the traditional slow moving companies of the past are indeed a thing of the past.   <br /> <br />Two Examples:   <br /> <br />We've all watched the AT&T breakup as then president Bob Allen traded the breakup of the corporation for permission to enter the computer business. The AT&T companies failed to understand how to make the move to an open competitive environment and this has been reflected in their stock prices.   <br /> <br />There was a time when the computer industry was characterized by the term \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" -- IBM and Univac, Burroughs, NCR, DEC, CDC, GE and RCA. Where are these companies now, the industry is Microsoft, Intel and the companies that implement their technologies.   <br /> <br />Such changes will happen in the future. The internet, the collapse of the two superpower world, the emergence of the European Common market, the changing world of Islam, rising Government intervention and more.   <br /> <br />Successful transition will require flexibility and foresight. Without making any guarantees, this book at least points out how to approach the problems.	2004-11-16

Part of the problem has been that the brain can be viewed in so many different ways. The same organ can think of Einstein's Theory of Relativity in one instant and be smiling and talking baby talk to an infant the next.  <br /> <br />In this book Dr. Geary brings together research from neuroscience, behavior genetics, and cognitive science along with the behavioral sciences such as primatology, anthropology, and sociology to present an integrated view of the brain as we know it today.  <br /> <br />The chapter \\"General Intelligence in Modern Society\\" is brilliant in it's explanation of IQ testing and its relationship with society. It both confirms, explains, and rejects the findings in the best seller \\"The Bell Curve\\" from 1994. \\"The IQ test,\\" Dr. Geary says, \\"was designed to predict educational outcomes.\\" And in this it works very well - in one study 20% of the people in the 99th percentile had Ph.D. degrees. He then discusses other aspects such as motivation, family, social presures and more as reasons for achievement in education, work and income. There's far too much to cover in a short review like this one.  <br /> <br />This is not a book that has been dumbed down for the general reader. It is a definitive tome on the state of the understanding of the brain as it exists today. It is fascinating reading, but not something that you're going to race through in an afternoon.	2004-11-16

Dyna-Soar was being pushed then as a Fractional Orbit Bombardment System (FOBS). It was to be launched by a massive booster, go into orbit, reach its target and drop an atomic bomb on it. Then the program got cancelled.  <br /> <br />In this book it appears that the program had no real direction. It was a space plane, it was a research vehicle, it was recon vehicle, it was a shuttle, it was part of the Apollo program. The opinion is expressed that Robert McNamara cancelled the program because no one could tell him what he was getting for the money being spent. I suspect this is true, but I also expect that this was only part of the story. At the time there was a little thing going on called the Viet Nam war that was beginning to suck up a lot of money. The Apollo program was going strong, also expensive. President Johnson wanted money for his War on Poverty. Finally, one of the Anti Missile Treaties signed by the US and the USSR prohibited FOBS.  <br /> <br />This book covers the Dyna-Soar program through reprinting the official documentation that flowed between the Air Force, NASA and the Contractors. There is very little analysis of what happened. As a collection of documents, this is the raw material that gives the unvarnished truth.  <br /> <br />There's room here for another book that would give more of the political aspects. Could we have built it then? Could we build it now? Maybe we should give the project to Burt Rutan and Scaled Composites - The Dyna-Soar bird looked a lot like their Space Ship One.	2004-11-16

(Well, it's the latest thing today, tomorrow is another story with the speed with which the web is developing.) Portals are a group of portlets that form a logically associated group. They allow a common framework to be used with a set of \\"sub-pages\\" that can present different but related information. You can get more information about the IBM approach to portals by doing a Google search on Websphere Portal and going to the IBM site.  <br /> <br />This book is intended to serve the Novice to Intermediate level programmer. It starts at an elementary level of the \\"This is a portal.\\" From there it goes on to more advanced subjects.  <br /> <br />Perhaps a list of the Table of Contents of the book will serve as good as anything else to give the range of subjects covered:  <br /> <br />Introduction  <br />Writing Your First Portlet  <br />Expanding Your First Portlet  <br />Portlet States and Modes  <br />Creating Advanced Portlets  <br />Languages and Markups - Deutsch, Francais, Espanol?  <br />Portal Services  <br />Struts Portal Framework  <br />Security and the Credential Vault.	2004-11-16

Unfortunately, Davis explained, the Confederacy needed a half a dozen.\\"  <br /> <br />During the war the South had eight full generals. Of these only Lee proved to be fully up to the demands of the job. Albert Sidney Johnston died (Shiloh) before he could really prove himself. The others Joe Johnson, P. G. T. Beauregard, Braxton Bragg, Samuel Cooper, Edmund Kirby Smith, John Bell Hood did not live up to the expectations of Davis.  <br /> <br />Many of these men have not received the attention due them while other generals of lessor rank have received much more. Samuel Cooper, in particular is little known. As the adjutant and inspector general of the Confederacy, he spent the war behind a desk. But it was from this desk that the men, weapons, food and other supplies went to the front line armies.  <br /> <br />This is an excellent book, covering an aspect of the war not seen before.	2004-11-16

It combines religious aspects, with law and rules by which you should live your daily life. It is the defining book of the people it seems we will be fighting for the next few years. Muslims consider the Koran to be EXACTLY the very Word of God.<br /><br />This book is aimed at those who need to understand the psychological nature of our oponnents. Hopefully this will include military leaders (The book is published by the Army War College.), political leaders, and - although I suppose it is too much to ask - reporters.<br /><br />As with the Jewish and Christian Bibles, the Qur'an is long enough to have enough quotes to justify almost anything.

In this book Johannes Steinhoff establishes himself as a thinker as well as a fighter pilot with 176 victories. The main part of the book covers just June 21st to July 13, 1943. During this time the 77th Fighter Wing took to the skies above Sicily in a valiant but futile attempt to stop the allied landings.  <br /> <br />It's a story of a small group of men with limited equipment (and that equipment beginning to show its age) trying to stop a flood.  <br /> <br />This is not a story of heroic Nazi's breathing fire and mouthing slogans. It's a story of rather desparate men trying to do their best in a situation they couldn't control. Just one small step on the path to ultimate defeat.  <br /> <br />Then the Epilogue is almost worth the cost of the book itself. With many years to reflect on the happenings during the first half of 1945 Mr. Steinhoff provides just a few pages of analysis on what a modern country has to do to maintain its position in the world.	2004-11-16

I asked for David Weber's new book.  <br /> <br />\\"Oh yes,\\" she says, \\"they just came in, I put them -- where did they all go?\\"  <br /> <br />There was one left, I grabbed it.  <br /> <br />\\"What is that book,\\" she asked, and I had to explain.  <br /> <br />If you don't know about David Weber/Honor Harrington, go to the baen.com web site and read the first fifteen chapters. They are free. Beware however, that they are likely to hook you.  <br /> <br />This is not an Honor Harrington book. She appears briefly before heading to take over the Eighth Fleet. From there it will be difficult for her to assume command of a ship small enough to do the kind of fighting that is done so well in the Honor Harrington books. (CS Forester had the same problem in the Horatio Hornblower series.)  <br /> <br />David Weber has come up with an interesting approach with two spin off series, of which this is one. Here are some characters we've met before along with a bunch of new ones. They have a mundane task to go patrol the Talbott Cluster but you know what's going to happen: intrigue, space battles, crippled ships limping home filled with glory.  <br /> <br />There's no one doing a better job with space opera these days, perhaps that's why it made the New York Times best seller list in its first week.	2004-11-16

Watching a professional baseball game on television is an exercise in just how much statistical information can be displayed on the screen without totally blocking out the game itself. What I didn't realize was just how much history there was behind these numbers. I presumed, with I suppose a majority of other people, that all these statistics were simply a product of all the new computers.  <br /> <br />No, the author says, the numbers began just about as soon as the game was invented. In fact, I'm kind of surprised that the numbers didn't come first, but I guess that they couldn't -- could they?  <br /> <br />Nah! They couldn't. The first big statistical report of a baseball series didn't appear until August 18, 1858.  <br /> <br />Delightful book with the season now over and months until the new one starts.	2004-11-16

The essence of intelligence is to continue to grow and develop over the years. What he calls Mind Magic seems to me to be a kind of insight or wisdom into a problem or life in general.  <br /> <br />I particularly like his approach of not saying this is the way and the only way. He says this is what some people have done, what some people have learned. It is still up to you to develop your own way of dealing with the real world. He does give a series of useful problem solving principles that can be applied to many of the problems you face in work and life.  They are not specific, but guidelines that are general enough to be helpful in many situations.	2004-11-15

In this book he explains the essence, truth, and wisdom of Ninjutsu, an art of a thousand forms and innumerable variations.  <br /> <br />A Ninja, in ancient Japan was not the hired assassin of the movies, but a feudal warrior assigned to protect their families, their clans, and their country. Harshly trained they developed a tough but pliant spirit, and martial skills suitable for coping with any situation. He would avoid unnecessary conflict, and even if armed with a blade would find a way to win without staining it. The basic creed was to win without conflict. Continual fighting requires that you must win all the time, one failure (with Japanest swords) was likely your last. The true skill of the Ninja was to survive.  <br /> <br />Here is the story of the Ninja told in a combination of writing and photographs that deliver the essence of the Ninja way of life.	2004-11-15

The next year it was Yale's turn to win 1 to 0. In fact that began a winning streak that lasted until 1891 (to be sure there were some 0 to 0 ties and a few years when they didn't play) when when Harvard finally won 12 to 6.  <br /> <br />But in spite of a few tidbits like these, this isn't a history book. This is almost a eulogy to the rivalry. Perhaps eulogy isn't exactly the right word since they usually reflect on something past, and this rivalry certainly isn't over.  <br /> <br />The book is historical, but spends most of its time on the recent games, players, and coaches. The two writers are both Massachusetts men, but then again, Massachusetts is just a short physical distance from New Haven. Delightful book.	2004-11-10

You called Ma Bell, explained a few things like number of individual telephones, you waited a while, then the equipment showed up and you started writing a check each month. Data transmission was at best a secondary requirement (maybe not even that high). Not so anymore.  <br /> <br />Today you buy bandwidth and it's pretty much up to you to decide what to do with it. Cisco has been in the absolute forefront of handling bandwidth, and with their Call Manager system is in the forefront of IP Telephony.  <br /> <br />Note that the title of this book says it is about best practices. The book is based on the questions that customers asked (the authors are all Cisco employees who talk to customers) about the CallManager system. It is intended for the voice and data networking professionals who either have CallManager installed or are considering installing it.  <br /> <br />The idea is to go beyond what the manuals say, to enable you to use the equipment in ways that make it more functional for your particular installation.	2004-11-09

Most of us who are interested in the history of World War II know the general stories. We know the broad pictures of what happened, when it happened and so on. What was missing, and I didn't even know it, was a sense of who were these men who fought so hard for so long for what most of us thing was a very bad cause.<br /><br />This book tells the story of seven of the Luftwaffe Aces. Not just fighter pilots but people in all branches of the Luftwaffe: bombers, night fighters, ground support. These men (usually) had joined the Luftwaffe a few years before the war, and unless killed were still flying at the end of the war. They each completed hundreds, if not a thousand missions - not to degrade the 25-35 missions flown by the 8th air force crews.<br /><br />These men were the best the Luftwaffe could put up. And good men they were. Frank Kurowski, the author of numerous books on World War II has put together a masterpiece.	2004-11-09

We don't even like to use the word die, we say passed away, crossed the river Jordan, or other terms. ==A major aspect of western religion is defining life after death. And in this monumental work, the origin and evolution of afterlife thoughts are traced. He begins with the Egyptions, where a life after death theology began to be developed. He thoroughly examines other early cultures such as Mesopotamia, Canaan, Greece, etc.  <br /> <br />Finally he gets into the big three of western religions, first he covers Jewish views (Dr. Segal is a professor of Jewish studies at Columbia). Christian views come largely from Paul (Dr. Segal wrote a definitive book on Paul.) and the Gospels. For Islam, of course the Qur'an and some of the more modern writings are used.  <br /> <br />In spite of the books large size (about 730 pages of text plus 150 pages of notes) it is fascinating enough and well written enough that it is relatively easy reading.	2004-11-09

A new and extensive biography of a man revered but really little known. His pictures of birds are still reprinted. He managed to capture the essence of the bird in a way that really hasn't been done since. He captured in his drawings a feeling that this was the birds life. He captured this in a time before the camera. He was able to capture a sense of movement, of flight that still today is astounding.  <br /> <br />We know the work of Audubon, but little about him or his life. We now know that he observed the birds, shot a few of them, posed them using wire to hold them in place, drew his pictures and had the birds for dinner. (Not something I suspect that the Audubon society puts at the beginning of their literature.)  <br /> <br />Audubon's story is almost a defining story for what America was supposed to be. The illegitimate son of the French middle class, coming to America at 18 in part to escape serving in Napoleon's army. He made a marriage out of love that survived failing businesses, moves about the interior of the country and finally a long separation as he went to England to promote his masterpiece, a book of paintings of all of the (known) birds of North America.   <br /> <br />This book is more than just a biography, it is also a history of a side of America not usually discussed. Among other things it covers the big earthquake in Missouri, the first railroads, a story of the middle part of America.	2004-11-09

We look at the big corporations, the big banks, Governments and they seem to go on forever. Yet not many last more than a few hundred years, if that long. By any measure the Roman Catholic Church is the most successful organization in the world. For 2000 years it has existed, more or less without change.  <br /> <br />From an organizational theory standpoint, how was this organization formed, how does it function. How has it lasted twenty centuries through almost insurmountable problems - Martin Luther, The Inquisition, various hostile attacks from Genghis Kahn to Stalin?  <br /> <br />From another standpoint, how does a single organization, based in Europe attempt to understand and control this organization spread literally in every around the world. To be sure there are conflicts. The sexual abuse scandals in American and British Catholicism that broke in 2002 showed clearly that there was a misunderstanding on both the sides of the English speakers and the Vatican.  <br /> <br />But I don't believe anyone doubts that the organization will continue. Indeed the Christian religiion may be the best defense in the coming years against another religion more oriented to terrorist ways, Islam.	2004-11-09

Ten incidents during World War II are analyzed from a What If standpoint. For instance:  <br /> <br />What If Montgomery had made some very minor changes in the organization and training of his troops for D-Day. Could he have captured Caen on the first day? If he had, what would have been the impact?  <br /> <br />What If the Canadians had gotten to Falaise to meet Patton and truly close the Falaise gap before the great part of the German support troops and enough fighting formations got out to form the basis for the units that manned the defense of the Rhine and handled the Battle of the Bulge?  <br /> <br />After Falaise, Patton appealed to Eisenhower to give him enough fuel for a quick and narrow thrust into Germany. Suppose he had gotten them and sent a spearhead around Metz and crossed the Rhine.  <br /> <br />Montgomery proposed the same thing, but of course up North, Operation Market Garden to Arnhem. It failed of course because the releiving forces didn't get there in time. But What If they had.  <br /> <br />Ten incidents, they didn't happen, but they could have.	2004-11-09

And unless some dramatic changes in the thought processes of those in charge, is likely to be just as ineffective. Dr. Ullman defines  the danger as Jihadist Extremism, a polititial ideology just as Bolshevism or Nazism, with a thin veneer of religion that is intent on establishing some form of a fundamentalist state backed by Saudi oil money, with an almost unlimited supply of radical young men from Africa to Indonesia, and potentially with nuclear weapons from the Pakistani arsenal.  <br /> <br />To fight such forces will require a fundamental change in the way the United States and the rest of the world addresses the problem. To go on further would require that this review be nearly as long as the book itself. Let me just conclude that this book has the ring of George Kennan, Paul Nitze, Herman Kahn and Henry Kissinger in their early days of defining the danger of the post World War II Soviet Union. The country will ignore this book at its peril.	2004-11-09

Jim Brown served thirteen months in a Marine Corp artillery unit just south of the DMZ. He fought in some infamous places such as Khe Sanh and Con Thien, infamous enough that each of them have books of their own dedicated to just that battle. Jim Brown walked the walk, not just talked about it.  <br /> <br />At the sharp end of the stick, Mr. Brown talks about the impact at the front line of decisions being made back up the chain of command. In one story, B-52's come to their support and effectively stop the enemy activity. In a few weeks the NVA are back at it, shooting at them with mortars, artillery, even infantry attacks. Another set of B-52 attacks was requested. No, they were told that would be to admit that these fortresses were under seige. Did these guys never hear of George Patton's remark at the end of World War II, \\"Fixed fortifications are monuments to the stupidity of man.\\"  <br /> <br />This book cannot be recommended too highly.	2004-11-06

During a phase of fortress thinking, McNamara/Westmoreland devised a series of strong points to be held against all opposition. For three long years the Marines held Con Thien presumably to keep the North Vietnamese Army from coming south through the DMZ. <br /> <br />It seems like they forgot the George Patton quotation, \\"Fixed fortifications are monuments to the stupidity of man.\\" So there we sat. Just to the north was the DMZ. Beyond the DMZ was the enemy artillery. The enemy could shoot at us. We couldn't shoot at them because of \\"political sensitivities.\\" Sometimes you really gotta wonder.  <br /> <br />Written by a man who was there in a marine tank company (you don't read much about tanks in Viet Nam, but they were there). So you get a personal side to the story combined with a very well researched overall picture. An excellent combination not often seen. Highly recommended.	2004-11-05

You would expect the story of evolution to start with the past and come forwards. This one goes backwards. Dr. Dawkins book centers around forty of what he calls Rondezvous, points where species come together. Rondezvou 0 is is All Humankind is the point where we first meet a common human ancestor that is the ancestor of us all. It's an interesting concept but it works well. We are, after all more familiar with history that is more recent.  <br /> <br />The book covers the present back to Rondezvou 39 to a basic beginning. He relates the story of scientists mixing a broth of chemicals, warmed them, passed an electric current through them (as in lightening) and produced amino acids, the essential building blocks of life.  <br /> <br />Is this the true story. It's the distilled wisdom of the best scientists thought of today told in a delightful and articulate manner. It reminds me a lot of Carl's Sagan's Cosmos series where he used a time machine to examine the past.  <br /> <br />One question I'd really like to ask Dr. Dawkins. Recent studies show the formation of complex molecules in outer space, including organic compounds. Does this take us back to a Rondezvou 40 where a rain of cosmic particles brought life to Earth? Great Reading!	2004-11-05

It's only when the books come out that you can begin to understand what's been happening in our Government. And this is an excellent example. Here a knowledgeable insider writes a biography of the ultimate insider. The author Clarence Ashley was an analyst for the CIA working on Soviet strategic missile capabilities and preparing national intelligence estimates.  <br /> <br />George Kisevalter was a top case officer who ran two of the most important spy operations in the Soviet Union. He began working in intelligence activities during World War II and continued until his retirement in 1970, during this time he became as espionage genius. This book provides a behind-the-scenes look at spycraft in action, from dead drops and cutoffs to multilayered ciphers, the KGB's secret \\"spydust,\\" and everything in between. It should become one of the classic books on the US-Soviet rivalry during the Cold War.	2004-11-05

Owen Mackenzie is retired from founding a successful computer company, and is living the past, reflecting on the women of his life and on women in general. Somewhat perplexed by the whole thing, he reflects that \\"perhaps it was a simple question of electrical engineering: in a world full of plugs, nature must provide sockets.\\" As a computer type, I would have thought he would have seen it as programming. Giving two completely different programs, putting in the same data on a spreadsheet and a word processor yields entirely different results.  <br /> <br />If you are familiar with John Updike's work, some fifty books that have won just about every award there is, you'll find that he hasn't lost his touch. If you are not familiar with him, this is a book of our time, and it's a good place to get hooked.	2004-11-05

(Perhaps he was, but there are certainly other candidates, Stalin, several of the African leaders, but I digress.) But before the war, a time of depression, it must have seemed that democracy was in trouble. In the United States this was the time of the peak of communist ferver, and Charles Lindberg flirted with admiration of the Nazi's. (You may want to look at Philip Roth's new novel, The Plot Against America.) <br /> <br />In England, Lord Londonderry became a member of the cabinet as Secretary of State for Air - just when the RAF was grasping for new equipment powerful enough to take on Germany's. At the same time, he became friends with Herr Hitler.  <br /> <br />This was a time when appeasement was the order of the day to avoid a war at nearly any cost. This was a time when the 'final solution' was inconceivable. But life then was not just the desire to avoid war, even if the flower of a whole generation had been wasted in the first World War. This is the first book I've seen that goes into depth as to what was happening during this fateful time. Combine this fascinating story with an excellent writing style and you get quite a book.	2004-11-05

Written with the simple concept that we all have this bucket that we carry around with us all the time, every place we go. In this bucket we keep our emotions. Sometimes we add to our bucket, a kind word, a pat on the shoulder - usually little things, rarely big things like a raise or promotion. Sometimes we dip things out of our bucket, a negative thought, a cruel deed.  <br /> <br />The rewards of a full bucket are immense, not only a generally more productive life, but a longer happier life. Strange as it may seem, happy people live about ten years longer than grouchy people. This little book, only 128 pages won't take you long to read. The lessons in it are simple, straight forward, and easy to implement. It makes you feel better, it makes the people with whom you interact feel better, and you'll live longer.	2004-11-04

She was at once nurse (before there were nurses), administrator, politician, lobbyist and more. Her famous chart showing the causes of mortality for soldiers (reproduced in the book) that she devised in 1857 launched a radical reform in the housing and medical treatment of soldiers.  <br /> <br />And she got most of this done before becoming ill at age 37 and for all intents and purposes confined to her bedroom for the final fifty years of her life.  <br /> <br />As a book, this one sets a new standard for biographies. It reads almost as a novel, yet it is exhaustively researched and documented. The notes at the end of the book take up more than fifty pages.	2004-11-04

Using baseball vernacular, the authors of this book say that the most successful companies are those that keep their mind on developing strategies that gain them competitive advantage, which in turn will bring them substantial sales margins, above-average profit margins and earnings, lower-than-average debt, higher-than average credit ratings, and most important, leading market share. How can you possibly argue with that.  <br /> <br />But then they talk about drawing a bright line in what they call the caution zone. That's the point where society clearly says stop: up say, until someone finds you've created a Love Canal; a Bhopal, India gas leak; or of course that lovely morning when the Justice Department's Anti Trust Folk come calling.  <br /> <br />I could do without the sports comparisons, but the descriptions of the actions of various companies, the anecdotes of success, how the game is played in the major leagues (sorry, I had to) is quite interesting and well worth the low cost of the book. All you need is one or two good ideas to make up your cost and time.	2004-11-04

(Willkie really won only ten states.) Then the novel says that Lindberg's darker side: anti-semitism, pro-Hitler takes over and rebuilds America in the image of a Nazi Germany.  <br /> <br />It's a good novel, the chracters are real, the imagery is fearsome. It didn't happen, it didn't come close to happening. Then again, to have been an Indian in the west, a black in the south -- maybe we were closer than I think.	2004-11-04

In this book Dr. Jerry Avorn talks about the shortage of comparison data of similar drugs, lapses in the detection of lethal side effects, and drug company marketing plans that influence what doctors prescribe, and what patients demand.  <br /> <br />The good news, he explains, is that the real scientific evidence shows that many of the things that you can do to protect and preserve your own health are far more effective than what the drug companies products can do for you. Unfortunately this means things like exercise, lose weight, stop smoking - things that are harder to do than simply taking a pill.  <br /> <br />Another approach he is spear heading is to provide more information that is really useful to both doctors and patients. Perhaps this can be made to counter some of the one sided claims made for the newest and much more expensive wonderdrug over something older, cheaper but just as effective. See more at powerfulmedicines.com.  <br /> <br />An unintended side effect: It made me wonder if it is time to buy drug company stock.	2004-11-04

There have been a lot of marketing books that tell you you need to have unique products, somekind of gimmick or whatever. This one is different. The theme of the two authors is that the old standby rules still work, and work better than the new gimmicks.  <br /> <br />The authors talk of a study done by Shell Oil. What people want is to refuel at a reasonable cost; be sheltered from sun, wind, and rain; and pay and exit quickly. They expect the pumps, and the bathrooms to be clean and working. The customers are not looking for a great cappuccino. No body believes that the super additives being advertised as brand differentiation does anything that the additives that every one has in their gasoline.  <br /> <br />I'm reminded of the Warren Buffett investment strategy, invest in companies you can understand, whose revenue and earnings are growing, and don't change too often.  <br /> <br />I then like the way the authors say that for advertising, forget these rules. To be heard in today's market you need distinctive, out-of-the-box communications; inside-the-box standard advertising won't be heard.	2004-11-04

Jon Katz is REALLY one of the dog people. He finally reaches the point where he takes his three dogs and moves them to a farm in upstate New York complete with as you see in the sub-title: sixteen sheep, two donkeys and himself. Well, I've certainly reached the point in my working career (several times in fact) that moving to a small farm in the middle of nowhere seemed like a good idea.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately in my case, there was a small matter of making a living. It helps if like Jon Katx you have written thirteen books, all of which seem to be still available from Amazon (although some of them are only available used). Then again, if you've written thirteen books, with more under way, you obviously have a career, and one that lets you get away to the small farm. If you've written thirteen books, you've obviously developed a writing style that pleases a goodly number of people. And reading this book you can see why. The prose is simply delightful. The dogs come almost human, the man becomes a better human. If you're a dog person you owe it to yourself to read this one.

My one complaint here would be that I'd sure like to have seen more pictures. His words are elequent, his descriptions great, but remember the bit about picture and a thousand words.  <br /> <br />Bridges take up about half the book. then he goes on to describe an eclectic collection of engineering projects that don't quite fit together but which make nice little essays of their own.  <br /> <br />Interesting enough, a couple of his essays cover engineering projects that failed. In his interestingly named Vanities of the Bonfire, he gives an engineering report of the collapse of the stack of logs that made up the 1999 bonfire at Texas A&M. It would be very amusing except that it killed a dozen people and injured several more. Consistent with todays law suit environment, it is now estimated that a new bonfire would cost between one and one and a half million dollars.	2004-11-04

Like another book starts out: \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\\" But with the season over, it's clearly time to do some reading.	2004-11-03

I'm writing this review on the day George W. won his second term. (Thank God the political ads are finally over.) This little book is about George W's fourth term. Yes, that's right, fourth term, he's still president in 2014. He's finally been able to get rid of America's \\"treasonous\\" opposition party. The Patriot Act VI has ... well you get the idea, it's George Orwell's 1984 thirty years later.  <br /> <br />The author, Dawn Blair, is also a character in the story telling the story in the first person. Dawn Blair is a pseudonym for the real author Jonathan Greenberg, who used a pen name for this book to emphasize one of the work's many parallels to George Orwell-whose real name was Eric Blair. That should give you some idea of what to expect in the book. It's well thought out, well written and just a bit wacky. The hero of the book is Winston Smith, the hero in 1984 was, yup - Winston Smith. If you haven't read 1984, its available free at books-on-line.com  <br /> <br />Remember though, this is just a novel, just like 1984. 1984 was/is a good book, but the real 1984 didn't turn out like the fictional 1984 any more than this book actually predicts the future. I have more faith in the American system.	2004-11-03

There was so much used equipment (much of which hadn't even been taken out of the box) that new sales had to fall. But time marches on and Cisco has clearly survived and even thrived. But there have been some changes. New products and even new product directions have come about. Still, however more than half the revenue of the company comes out of ethernet switches.  <br /> <br />This book focuses on the concepts, architecture, configuration, and troubleshooting of Cisco Ethernet switches. It is designed to fit the needs of the networking professional from the almost beginner through intermediate level. The book begins, just as it should, with a discussion of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model. From here it goes on for a truly excellent first thirty pages, the thirty pages that most computer books seem to leave out. It goes on to giving some description of the older technologies (that many of use still have to maintain) and finally to the newest, latest and greatest.  <br /> <br />This is an in depth coverage that is truly excellent.	2004-11-03

Jody Weiner, a practicing attorney for thirty years, this book is a legal oriented mystery. The hero is a journalist investigating a prominent attorney who has been accused of conspiring with a judge to get the fix in on a criminal case. As you might expect, things have to get more complicated than that such as falling for the attorney's fiancee, his family gets involved, a good bit of humor, ocassionally it makes you laugh enough to make the people around you stare. ==I'm not sure if this is Mr. Weiner's first book or not, but at any rate, it deserves to be a success and to be the start of a series. The characters, both the attorney and the journalist are well defined and interesting -- and what's better to cement a relationship than a bit of jail time.	2004-11-03

Computer Architecture, Computer Architecture - General, Although Cisco is well noted for the technical depth of most of their books, this is not really a technical book. Instead it is aimed at the buisness manager who is thinking of installing a Storage Area Networks (SAN). It covers how to calculate such things as the total cost of ownership, the effect on your current infrastructure and how the present IT staff will cope with the new equipment, the new technology.  <br /> <br />The book is not completely untechnical. It includes a complete overview of the concepts which include the interconnection systems, the topology, backup and replication, etc. But these subjects are covered at the business manager level, not the level of the technicians responsible for the actual installation of the system.  <br /> <br />All in all, the clearest business oriented book on the subject I've seen.	2004-11-03

Since that time, his magic has continued --he is number two on the Fortune list of the richest Americans, and the only one in the top five who made his fortune in the stock market.  <br /> <br />His basic rule is very simple: invest in businesses that are simple and understandable, have a consistent operating history and have favorable long term prospects. Now, keep that in mind while the world is changing about you, while people are crashing airplanes into buildings, going to war in Iraq, through inflation, deflation, stock booms and busts, and all the personal troubles that we fall into. <br /> <br />This second edition is completely revised and brought up to date and includes two new chapters that help to update and revise his strategy. This is one of those books that you simply must be aware.	2004-11-03

Alan Shepard's \\"course\\" on the moon probably isn't going to be open for regular play for several years. And the pictures of the Kabul Golf and Country Club, complete with the caddy carrying a Soviet RPK-74 machine gun and a map of the minefields may be for you, but I think I'll pass. But the floating green on the Coeur d'Alene Resort (Idaho, and a truly beautiful place) that they move around every night looks great. Furnace Creek (Death Valley, California) looks like it might be a good place to play in mid-winter. 200 degree plus ground temperature in the summer is a little warm for me. And of course the Lucifer's Anvil course (Black Rock Desert, Nevada) is between the two so why not stop there.   <br /> <br />This book describes thirty of the more unusual golf courses you're likely to find. What a Christmas present for the golfer who has everything....	2004-11-03

But with the Spider Queen still unable or unwilling to acknowledge her followers, and with drow society perched on an ever weaker edge over an ever deeper chasm, Ryld will find himself drawn to a woman who is in turn drawn to a goddess. And that goddess isn't Lolth. When his own heart turns against him, will he be man enough to follow it, or drow enough to survive?  <br /> <br />That's from the flyleaf of the book, so mentioning it here isn't telling you any more than your looking over the book. This is the fifth in the series created by R. A. Salvatore. As with any series where the world is designed by one person and the actual books are written by others, some will love this one, some will hate it. But if you're into the series you gotta read it, no question about that at all. Otherwise how can you possibly be ready for the next book. As for myself, I enjoyed it a great deal.	2004-11-03

As the name implies, this volume concentrates on interior design. It discusses and illustrated some 20 interior design projects by some of Americas leading firms.  <br /> <br />The photography is absolutely top notch, as was the selection of the homes and apartments to be photographed. The description to go along with the photography describes what the designer had in mind when selecting the furniture, art, and colors of the room.  <br /> <br />The projects in this book cover a wide range of interior designs from the ultra modern to traditional. It makes it clear that the art of interior design is not dead, although you will certainly have to have a strong bank account to afford some of these rooms. Excellent.	2004-11-02

How silly, what could possibly have happened in so short a time so long ago. Well, of course there was the Magna Carta. And that's probably why this particular year was picked. One of the great documents of all time, some of its clauses are repeated almost verbatim in the US Constitution.  <br /> <br />But then as you get a little further into it, there was a lot going on about that time. The crusades were just about at their prime Jerusalem had just been taken by Saladin. The University at Oxford was established, Cambridge just a few years later. And in 1215 Peking fell to Genghis Kahn.  <br /> <br />The real strength in the Year 1000 was its detail on common life at the time. By 1215 a lot of this had changed. For one thing, buildings were now being built of stone rather than wood, and that means that at least some of them have lasted until today so that we have more evidence of how people actually lived.  <br /> <br />About half the book is on the life being lived by the ordinary people. The other half covers the soap opera life that King John and his family was leading at the time. Excellent book, all but guaranteed to be a best seller.	2004-11-02

As big as it is, with as many pages as it has, the web is really in its infancy. New technologies are constantly being developed. Some of these will suceed and some will not. Microsoft SharePoint Web Parts are one approach that gives the end user some control over the information content and appearance of information coming from an Internet host. The current version of web parts is 2003. This new is not necessarily compatible with the older 2001 version. It does appear however that the system is getting closer to being ready for prime time. Note that these are new features a la Microsoft. Other browsers, or older browners will not support the capabilities.     It is possible for each end user to exercise some control over the pages he sees, but except in extraordinary circumstances, this doesn't seem likely. It seems more oriented to internal corporate users where the web designer can do specific team oriented customized views. In essence the salesmen in the field can see one thing, displayed in a manner comfortable for them, while the accounting department sees something quite different.     The Rational Guide books are somewhat of a new concept in publishing where a small book, compared with most computer books, can hold down the price and the size while devoting itself to one subject. In addition, the publisher has made additional information available on his web site to allow the reader to expand his knowledge beyond just this book. I like this concept. All computer books don't need to be 1,000 pages, much of which is just copied from the previous edition. The audience for this book is considered by the publisher to be a Beginner/Intermediate Developer. Beginner - yes, Web Parts are so new that almost all of us are beginners. But this is not the book for someone just starting out on IIS and ASP .NET.     Excellent concept for a book, well executed.	2004-11-02

New technologies are constantly being developed. Some of these will suceed and some will not. It's pretty clear, however, that one of the surviving technologies will be Sun's Java Server Pages and Servlets.  <br /> <br />And if you're looking for someone to hire to do these on your web site, you might ask the prospective employee if they know Servlets and JSP. One person says \\"Sure,\\" the other says \\"Sure, and I've passed the Sun Certified Web Component Developer Exam.\\" Which is going to get a step up in your hiring plans.  <br /> <br />This book has two (maybe three) goals, one is to teach you about the subject, the other is to help you pass the exam. The third possible goal is to do these two with a light heartedness and humor that can help you stay awake when your studying something a bit less interesting than say the Kama Sutra. Thys style won't suit everyone - does anything suit everyone.  <br /> <br />The result to me, is a book that accomplishes all of these goals quite well.	2004-11-02

I doubt that this was an intended result of the attacks, but there are now dozens of books about the Muslin culture out now where before they would not have been published.  <br /> <br />During this earlier time, there were certain scholars who did publish works on the Muslim culture. Berhard Lewis was one of these, and here has reprinted some 50 articles/essays that he wrote beginning in the 1950's. Because of the timespan, certain changes have taken place in the world that make some of the articles conflict with others. These points however are minor and understandable as thoughts change and mature over time.  <br /> <br />I found this book to be much more useful than his best seller What Went Wrong. Perhaps the limitations of a short space to bring up conclusions made more sense to me. I still cannot claim a perfect, or even a good,  understanding of the Muslim world. For instance, it is clear that a large number of people in the Muslim world hate the United States. It is also clear that a large percentage of people in the Muslim world would like to life in the United States.  <br /> <br />This book presents a series of thoughts that can only help to generate the understanding that will be necessary if any kind of peace is going to happen. I can't recomment it too highly.	2004-11-02

Wouldn't it be nice of your computer system could notify you immediately that you're selling a lot of something that normally sells very slowly?  <br /> <br />This is exactly the situation that Micro SQL Server 2000 Notification Services is designed to handle. It is a platform that includes a notification engine to tell selected individuals about selected changes in the information in the database. Computer systems normally work in a pull oriented architecture i.e. you go to the web and ask for the sales figures for each inventory item to see if there is an anomoly. Notification services changes this model to a push orientation. You subscribe (we don't want to be doing SPAM) and based on the criteria you select you are automatically notified of changes in the underlying data structure.   <br /> <br />The Rational Guide books are somewhat of a new concept in publishing where a small book, compared with most computer books, can hold down the price and the size while devoting itself to one subject.

Due to years of neglect, the American fighting forces, generally speaking, had vastly inferior equipment, and in many cases even worse tactics.  <br /> <br />Against the Japanese Zero fighter, the Americans fielded the vastly inferior Grumman F4F Wildcat. The Wildcat suffered in three vital areas to the Zero: climb, maneuverability and speed. The Wildcat did have advantages in firepower, due to the excellent .50 caliber Brownings, and in overall toughness. Jimmy Thach was able to come up with a flying mode to take advantage of those points in favor of the Wildcat while minimizing its disadvantages. This was called the Thach Weave after the inventor and the way he conceives of having two planes each fly a serpentine path that brought the planes together facing each other at frequent intervals. Thus any Japanese pilot falling in behind one of the planes would soon be facing the nose, and the machine guns of his partner. This enabled the American pilots to survive in the years it took to get more capable aircraft into service. The Thach Weave continues today, with todays far more capable aircraft but with the same basic principles and the same name.  <br /> <br />Mr. Thach survived the war and went on to ever higher positions within the Navy. This book uses just about half of its 338 pages on The World War II era, and the rest on his work at improving the Navy's aircraft afterward.	2004-11-02

Even more, they write it so much better than the rest of us.  <br /> <br />They also reflect on how their bi-lingualism makes their English better. It seems that the effort of learning the second language gives them somewhat of a drive to find ways to express themselves in English what might be an easy thing to express in their own tongue. As a result, they learn ways to use English that stretch the language to its limit.  <br /> <br />To have gotten fifteen writers of the caliber contributing essays to this book has to be considered a major coup on Wendy Lesser's part. This book provides an insight to language that is astounding.	2004-10-31

This new book does an excellent job of explaining the why as well as the what happened. No less important was the after effect of the war. As a result of this war, the United States was no longer a group of eighteen states but a country. And it was a country that turned its eyes westward to building a nation where before was the Louisiana Purchase. This book is sub-Titled: The War That Forged a Nation. After this, the European powers paid much more attention to these ex-British colonies.  <br /> <br />The famous Battle of New Orleans was fought after the signing of the Peace Treaty. Little known is that the treaty provided for peace to be established in phases as the distance from Ghent (Belgium) increased. So while the treaty had been signed, the war was still going on in New Orleans because the sailing ships of the day hadn't had time to get there. It was reading the Treaty of Ghent (on a slow boat with a limited library) that C. S. Forester came up with the idea of a story based on changing orders being given to a ship captain as new orders cought up with him. This fictional ship captain was Horatio Hornblower.	2004-10-30

The truth is that Beatrix Potter did indeed buy Hill Top Farm in 1905, not a common thing for a lady to do in that period. In fact you can visit the house.

His primary message is that the for profit drug companies are primarily concerned with making a profit to the neglect if not the outright damage to the public at large.  <br /> <br />This book should be of particular concern to those people:  <br /> <br />Taking hormone replacement drugs,  <br />with heart disease or stroke,  <br />osteoporosis  <br />diabetes, and  <br />osteoarthritis.  <br /> <br />The good news, he explains, is that the real scientific evidence shows that many of the things that you can do to protect and preserve your own health are far more effective than what the drug companies products can do for you. Unfortunately this means things like exercise, lose weight, stop smoking - things that are harder to do than simply taking a pill.

And the organization in the forefront of such problems is the Center for Disease Control, the CDC. Within the CDC the specialty group that goes to the field to perform the initial investigations and report back work for the Epidemic Intelligence Service.  <br /> <br />First formed during the Korean War when there were fears of biological weapons, the EIS has been around for 53 years. They are the front line. The list of diseases and incidents they have worked come straight off of the headlines: AIDS, Ebola, the anthrax crisis after 9/11, just recently there was SARS.  <br /> <br />This is the first time that a journalize has been welcomed into the relatively unknown organization. Ms. McKenna joined the first class on bioterrorism-response thought by the EIA after 9/11. With unprecedented access, she reports on this not secret, but almost unknown organization, its history, its present and its preparations for an unknown future.	2004-10-30

Florida drew the attention of the country and the world to the United States election system. But this was not the first and certainly won't be the last time that (shall we call them) irregularities occur in an election. Here are the stories of a few irregularities from where the country took the ballot boxes home (just for safe keeping of course) before the votes were counted to the big time vote arranging of the political bosses. Great reading, and plenty of blame on both parties. This way readers can say that he is prejudiced against their party.  <br /> <br />This presidential year I'm living in one of the battleground states. An organization set up tables at a series of super markets around the state to get people to register. They passed out the proper forms and collected the filled out forms to be filed with the country clerk. But only one party's forms were turned in.  <br /> <br />All and all, it's a wonder that our Government hasn't been any worse than it has. This book talks a lot about fraud. Maybe he'll write another one about incompetence.  <br /> <br />Our county was told that we had to have dual language voting.  <br /> <br />OK, our machines will do that.  <br /> <br />The second language has to be Piute indian. - Guess what indian language doesn't have a written language.	2004-10-30

Not as old as some universities (Harvard was founded in 1636), certainly not as big (City University of New York - CUNY with some 450,000 students is about a hundred times bigger). The USMA has produced a series of graduates that have achieved fame far beyond the size or age of the school: Eisenhower, Grant and Lee, and many, many more. Read any history of the United States, and numerous references.  <br /> <br />As part of the 200 year celebration, the invited a series of essays to be written covering a broad range of topics including the Academy's role in developing officer professionalism, its influence on the careers of distinguished graduates, institutional challenges and changes, the experiences of women and minorities at West Point, and the evolution of the academic curriculum.

This was ten years before the Russian invasion to put down the brief attempt to overthrow the communist regime. This was a time when the Government was avidly anti-church but the people were devoutly Catholic.

I've known of moduler homes for a long time and have basically rejected them as sort of a house trailer without wheels. Then a few years ago I regularly passed by a lot on which a house was being build. It followed the traditional pattern: earth work, foundation, and so on. One day as I drove by, I noticed a lot of trucks with big house components parked by the site, and a big crane. I was busy so I didn't stop. The next day the whole house was there and it didn't look like a house trailer at all.  <br /> <br />I stopped by to talk to them. The contractor, a specialist in this type of construction asked me: \\"Do you notice what you don't see around here.\\" \\"No,\\" I had to answer. \\"A big dumpster - Modular houses don't produce the waste of a stick built house.\\" \\"And all this stuff just fits together,\\" I asked. \\"Yup! It's all built inside a factory where they have jigs and fittings to hold everything to square angles and exact dimensions.\\" Then you look at buying in bulk rather than just a few sticks at a time, and it's substantially lest costly.  <br /> <br />This is the first book I've seen that goes into this kind of construction from start to finish. It covers every question I could think of to ask from start to finish. Anybody thinking of building or buying a house of any size should start with this book	2004-10-29

There are suppliers, customers, employees and of course the government. More and more, these outside influences are banning together in a perhaps unofficial but no less real ecosystem.  <br /> <br />In the computer industry, which everyone reading this must have some at least sideline awareness, there are two principle 'keystone' players: Microsoft and Intel. Around these companies there are literally thousands of other companies somehow creating a business around their core technologies. This works pretty well, so long as you are very careful. If you sleep next to an elephant, you'd best sleep with one eye open, just in case he decides to roll over. Just ask Netscape.  <br /> <br />These authors have attempted to provide a framework for analyzing such business ecosystems, drawing on examples from biology where such systems have been studied for many years.  <br /> <br />Most of the examples used in the book are from the American market. Next, I'd like to see the authors do a book comparing the American and the Japanese systems. It appears that the Japanese started this philosophy but that we have taken it into new and different directions, certainly less formal (the Japanese methods would be illegal here) but seemingly headed in much the same direction.	2004-10-29

This book is the 'authorized version.' It is based on letters Kerry wrote home and 'extensive interviews with virtually everyone who knew Kerry in Vietnam.'  <br /> <br />I turned first to the story of Kerry's first Purple Heart. The versions in the two books can't possibly cover the same person. In one Kerry is in a fire fight at night and trying to clear his jammed M-16 when he feel a hot, burning thing hit his arm. In the other it is daylight and Kerry shoots a grenade launcher at a rock some distance from his boat and a piece of shrapnel comes back and hits him in his arm. Well, at least they both agree that he was hit in the arm. This is the incident, I understand, where the official Navy records are missing.  <br /> <br />The essence of democracy is an informed electorate. I'm intend to vote in about five days. Somehow I don't feel very informed. <br /> <br />If you're a Kerry fan, this is clearly the book you need to read, it'll make you feel much better. If you're a Bush fan, you may want to read it just to see what the Kerry fans are saying. If you're trying to inform yourself about the character of this man, you probably should read both.  <br /> <br />One final comment, I was out of the Army before Vietnam got started going good. I've only known two people that were in Swift boats, they both hate Kerry. My guess is that Brinkley didn't talk to them.	2004-10-29

Three of the six survived the war - perhaps it helps to survive to get to tell your story to the book writers.  <br /> <br />These stories are interesting because they present a side of the war not often seen in the United States. These men were fighting against us, and they were on the losing side. Still they were men, and they tried to do the best they could for their country. I think anyone will agree that these men were provided with just about the best equipment of any army. But during the war the Germans built about 40,000 tanks. The United States alone built some 88,000, the Soviet Union built more than that.	2004-10-28

There are so many reasons to believe that E-Learning is going to become a major part of how people learn that it's unreal.     So far, most of e-learning has been business oriented. Businesses educating their employees is a major expense and is easy to quantify. You can have someone take a course in almost anything from human resources Policies, to transmission repair, to the details on the new life insurance policy you've just come out with. And at the end of the course you can ask a few questions and you know the effectiveness of the training immediately. And the business case is also easy to measure. For a few hundred dollars in equipment and communications cost you replace a classroom, a teacher and their administration.     Not far behind are the colleges with distributed campuses. I live in the American west. We have a small branch of a college some hundreds of miles away. A wide range of subjects which cannot generate enough interest for a class to be held here can be taught with this student studying one thing while the one next to her studies something entirely different.     Finally we have become a nation of computer users. That kid playing that video game may not realize it, but he is in training to be able to drive a tank.

That was a long time ago, and the pictures were slides. Now I go look at the slides and the glue has come off, the slides are peeling apart and they tend to stick in the projector.  <br /> <br />Digital cameras are probably worse. You've got to get the image out of the camera so you can take more pictures. You can keep them in some kind of digital storage, like on your hard drive - until it crashes or you upgrade the computer. Better is to produce a scrapbook that you can print out, pass along to the kids, keep in a file, and look it the pictures together.  <br /> <br />Producing a scrapbook is an interesting project in its own right - if nothing else you get to go look at the pictures again. But you really get to put the story together. The result can be quite attractive, especially if you use some of the special papers and other things that are available.  <br /> <br />This book is a how-to, a tutorial on putting the scrapbooks together. It is an introductory level book talking about the first plans through final production. The format doesn't lend itself to being a reference book, but by the time you're finished your first scrapbook or two, you probably won't need a reference book.	2004-10-28

I hate to say this, because it sounds so hokey in a book review, but this is one book I couldn't put down. Well obviously I could put it down, and I did. But I didn't until after I had read the first 54 pages, Part I of the book.  <br /> <br />Part I of this book talks about some applications of RFID that is stretching the limits of the technology as it exists today. He gives a series of examples of how RFID might be used in the future, along with a history of machine identification in the past. Perhaps my interest comes from the years I worked in that area. But that was some time ago, and RFID was just beginning. Now I see the applications he describes and immediately I think of several others. This kind of overview of where we are trying to go is rare in a technical book, and greatly appreciated.  <br /> <br />Part II of the book is a description of the current state of the art in RFID. Here is a detailed description of who makes what that you can use to implement what was thought about in Part I.  <br /> <br />He finally concludes with a short what-if story about a suspect container on a ship headed to an American port. This is straight out of not the headlines, but the comments made by John Kerry during the debates. This is a technology that is coming, that is needed.	2004-10-27

It's clearly not the only part -- while I suspect that both of the two running for President are confident that they are the best possible choice, one of the two isn't going to win unless it's a very unusual election.  <br /> <br />The counter to this is that if you know you aren't going to win (or succeed or whatever) you're right. The situations where essentially organizations, armies, or teams have competed and one has consistently won are too high to ignore. The German army in both World War II out performed the allied armies by at least one and a half to one even when faced with superior equipment. They knew they were better and they were. Of course, when you have 5,000 Panther tanks up against 53,000 Sherman tanks....  <br /> <br />This is an excellent book. It's writing style is almost as easy to read as a novel. The incidents it relates are very applicable to the story. While they probably don't relate to your business, industry or team, you'll find enough that are close enough to clearly cover the cost of the book.	2004-10-27

In reality it was not such a nice place. It was a filthy, deadly (Do a search on The Affair of the Poisons) place.  <br /> <br />This book is the autobiography of a dwarf named Hughes. He winds up at the court of Louis XIV, particularly as part of the household of his mistress Madame de Maintenon and eventually that of the kings mistress, Montespan. The story is filled with intrigue, sex, violence and mystery. As with most historical fiction, there is a mixture of fictional characters combined with the historical.  <br /> <br />This is an easy way to learn history. A good novel gives you the truth about the historical parts and combines it with a story that doesn't leave you trying to memorize a never ending list of dates. The important part is that a good novel, as this one is, gives you a feeling and understanding for life as it must have been during these times.	2004-10-27

This was a time of peace. But before his training ended, it was no longer peace time. The country and soon Butch Voris was at war. The planes they flew were Wildcats, not exactly the best machines to use up against Zeros. Not to many of the early fliers survived the war, but in spite of a number of close calls Butch did.  <br /> <br />After the war Butch was personally selected by Admiral Nimitz to set up a demonstration team to attract people to join the Navy. He did, it was called the Blue Angels. Before too long, another little situation came up called Korea. After that Butch went back to the Blue Angels, the only person ever to command it twice. Butch Voris eventually left the navy and went ot work for Grumman, being involved in the development of the F-14.  <br /> <br />The book is well written, and covers an interesting period of an interesting person's life.	2004-10-27

Hey guys, those jobs are gone. They are not coming back. I don't want, none of us want, to pay several thousand more for an \\"all American Car.\\"  <br /> <br />As this book points out, only an all encompassing organization, namely one that represents all of society wants to push policies that raise overall incomes rather than just that of their members at the expense of others.  <br /> <br />That's the theme of this book. It is not concerned with the social or intellectual origins of the protest movement, it focuses on the arguments advanced by those who what to halt or reverse market-driven globalization and destroy the international institutions that promote and oversee it. These protestors fall, broadly, into two groups: old-fashioned economic interests on the one hand, and, more important today, single-issue, non-governmental organizations, often with mass memberships, on the other.  <br /> <br />Born of Jewish parents in England, refugees from Europe, Mr. Wolf has, if not first hand, then close second hand, knowledge of the perils of Nazi, Soviet, Maoist governments. Then a period of time in the World Bank, observing the realities of tightly controlled governments in failing countries has given him a strong agreement with Churchill's famous statement: \\"Democracy is the worst of all systems, except all the others that have been tried.\\" Great Book.	2004-10-27

No Starch Press does some very good stuff. They have a style and a way of putting a book together that suits my reading style very well.  <br /> <br />This book is no exception. The world of putting together a web page has changed. Not too many years ago, you learned HTML and you pretty well had a handle on doing a web page. Not true any more. The simple font statement controlled what font you used and various modifiers to the command gave additional things like color and size. This has been replaced with Cascading style sheets. Java and JavaScript have come in to provide a programming capability that didn't exist before.  <br /> <br />Here in one volume are the three main web programming languages. It is not, quite possibly, the best introductory text you could find. It is, as the title says, a desk reference. It doesn't say this is HTML and if you want to do a web page start here and try this tag, then let's use that tag. It has every HTML tag, every attribute in HTML and CSS, collections, classes, methods, etc. They are arranged alphabetically, so you can find them easily if you know what you are looking for. Finally, it's up to date with the latest standards so it is probably more current than the individual books you bought earlier.  <br /> <br />You don't have to save much time to justify having this book on your desk.	2004-10-27

Unlike Huntington's Clash of Civilizations, the author says that we are not doomed to a struggle to the death, any more than the religious between Protestants, Catholics and Jews.  <br /> <br />Written from the viewpoint of a historian accustomed to see the world as a process of change, the author sees changes occurring in both camps. He sees a more moderate, accepting view coming from the Islamic world, with the modern day terrorists and religious conservatives being not unlike the Christian equivalents.  <br /> <br />This view is close to that I see from the few muslim people visiting here from other countries (such as Iraq). I have been wondering if their views represent a majority, a small minority, or are even just being polite to tell me what I want to hear. <br /> <br />Let us hope this author is right. Sooner or later, we all have to live together on just one planet.	2004-10-27

It is a mixture of theory and practice.  You teach the theory, and you assign 'homework' that enables these theories to be put into practice.  <br /> <br />In the military acadamies you are teaching one of the hardest leadership tasks, how to make people perform in the crucible of combat. Here leadership is more important than in most companies. It is a field that the academies study very closely.  The graduates of the program are those who lead the Navy in time of peace and peril.  <br /> <br />This book concentrates on the Navy way of teaching leadership. It is not necessarily the way that is suited for every environment, but after all, it is only one book. And after all, some people will do better than others -- we are after all, just people. This book describes the way that the Navy has trained its officers for a long time, it works for them, and as a business manager there are certainly techniques that are applicable to business practices.	2004-10-27

In 1805, almost exactly 200 years ago, Horatio Nelson was killed just as his plans to defeat the French fleet were suceeding. Beautiful timing for a new biography that brings new light on Nelson's life.  <br /> <br />The basics of the his life are not unknown. The interesting points addressed in this work concern things like his rise to such heights of power within the British Navy. The navy was a bastion of priveledge. The higher the social/royal ranking of a person, and the more wealth to impress one's peers the greater likelihood of promotion and power.  <br /> <br />As the fifth son of a clergyman his rise to power had to depend on performance, fame, competance. Also there had to be hidden drives and an ability to self-promote in a manner that would not be offensive. How did Nelson rise to the top of the power pyramid? How did he get the captains of other ships, often people of higher social standing to follow his commands. The author was a senior manager at a large firm in England. He is able to analyze Nelson's life from a slightly different point of view than that of the more normal academic writer.  <br /> <br />The result is a book that is likely to remain a classic for many years.	2004-10-27

Martin Jerrold, not cut from the same cloth at all. It starts out with him waking up from a hangover, a state in which he had gotten through the Battle of Trafalgar.   <br /> <br />This though is a murder mystery set in the same time frame. Lt. Jerrold is quickly suspected of murdering a British sailor. His new commanding officer, and the magistrate would see him hanged. They probably would if they could identify the corpse. His long suffering Uncle at the Admiralty gives him two weeks to solve the murder.   <br /> <br />Written in the same style as the other books, this one is even better at painting a picture of the life of the time. Life at Dover, a center of smuggling is presented as dramatically different than life at sea as in the other books. The people are more varied, the situations more surprising.   <br /> <br />This is supposed to be the first of a trilogy. Now the problem is waiting for the second volume. I also wonder if Edwin Thomas realizes just what he has created here. He may well be writing of the hapless Lt. Jerrold for a lifetime.	2004-10-27

Both of them are the polished, practiced professionals their party thinks can lead them to victory. They even wore identical suits, but Kerry's red tie had a few more spots in it than did Bush's red tie.  <br /> <br />Cornel West's latest book says that the deep democratic traditions of our country are at risk in this Post 9/11 world. He says that three dogmas are leading the country down a dangerous, non-democratic path. these are: a callous free-market fundamentalism, aggressive militarism and insidious authoritarianism.  <br /> <br />We are in a time of a single super power. Where are the checks and balances if they don't come from inside? This book provides an insight to where we are going that deserves a lot of thinking.	2004-10-27

By the end of Freud's life in 1939, the first cracks in his theories were beginning to be made by the neurologists. Since then, the neurologists have continue to develop their theories to meet every increasing evidence on how the brain works.  <br /> <br />In this book, Dr. Hobson writes abou thirteen dreams that he had over several years. For each dream he analysizes it not from the standpoint Freud would use, but from the standpoint of modern neurological science - i.e. how much wine did he have to drink that suppressed REM sleep leaving him REM deprived.  <br /> <br />This book presents an interesting view of the modern developments in dream analysis based on current techology.	2004-10-27

This book is really two books in one, both of them excellent. The first book ends at page 180. The second begins at 181. In between is BABY DAY. This is one of those days that dramatically change your life forever more. There's the first day you go to school, and there's the last day you go to school before entering the work force. On BABY DAY, your world turns over. Nothing will ever be the same again, from here on it's not your life, it's your life as a father or mother.  <br /> <br />As I said, the book is excellent, I could tell you about it, but you know what to expect. I can only say that you won't do better than this one. Having said that, I can go on to talking about some of the things he left out.  <br /> <br />You know those stores that sell things in huge quantities, Costco and Sam's Club are two of them. Before the baby comes, go visit one of them. On your shopping list put diapers, sleeping gowns, and film.  <br /> <br />Diapers, well, your neighbor probably gave you a small package. That will last about an afternoon. Get the giant economy size package, or at those discount stores, perhaps you can buy them by the pallet.  <br />Sleeping gowns - simple, diapers leak, nuff said.  <br />Film, you will probably not use more than a roll a day after the first few days.  <br /> <br />Finally, sometimes you'll wonder how any of them grow up.

Certainly there were a bunch of them surrounding Lincoln's death, and Kennedy and Roswell. In this book, Peter Lance an award winning investigative reporter looks carefully into the TWA 800 case and the 9/11 incident.   <br /> <br />He brings up a lot of interesting points. But I'm not sure just what to believe. For instance, he asks the question 'Why wasn't NORAD (the Air Force) alerted to the hijackings until eighteen minutes after air traffic controllers realized a hijacking was in progress.' I think that's pretty easy to answer. The controllers weren't sure it was a hijacking, they are government employees, they had to get permission first. And the boss was probably in the bathroom, in a meeting, on the phone. There are all kinds of reasons to use up 18 minutes. You don't want to charge conspiracy when simple incompetance may account for it.   <br /> <br />You may accept, or reject his conclusions, (or like me, admit you don't know) but if you don't have the information, you can't even make that decision. Mr. Lynch has exhaustively researched the files, studies and news reports. The resulting book is an excellent summary of what happened. I was particularly impressed with the TWA 800 information as this has been less available than 9/11 information.	2004-10-26

The book he wrote, The Book of Five Rings, is available in at least a dozen editions in English, and many, many more in various languages. It is a standard text on modern Japanese corporate management. Modern implies that it was written a bit more recently than four centuries ago. But it was published just before his death in 1645.  <br /> <br />This is an extensively researched book. Musashi left only a few sentences regarding his own life. Original sources used for this book included: the monument inscribed with the story of his life that was erected by his sone in 1645 to the Nitenki; a compilation of stories about Musashi and his disciples published in 1755; various clan records that were touched by Musashi's presence.

Each team has a couple of pages describing where they are, what happened last year and what it expected next year.  <br /> <br />Then it gets really interesting. Mr. Hollinger has developed a fairly sophisticated set of statistical standards that he then applies to each player on the team. This includes such things as analyzing the per-minute of play performance rather than the game performance. This says that a player getting ten points in ten minutes is better than a player getting 30 points a game (The results are something the NBA management should check out). Other statistics are likewise specially developed for this book. It makes you wonder if even the teams know this much about their players.  <br /> <br />John Hollinger never played in the NBA, he never coached, he just has spearheaded this new more analytical approach to pro basketball.	2004-10-26

But only about a very few places. We've heard about Iraq, North Korea, Afghanistan, and a little bit about a few others. But it's a lot bigger world than that. And at the middle of just about everything has been James Wolfensohn.  <br /> <br />For the past nine years he has been president of the World Bank. He has become an almost bigger than life character and has molded this unweildy to fit his image. During these years there have been financial crises, the AIDS outbreaks in many of the poorist countries, the emergence of terrorists sanctuaries in states that have basically failed and an immense amount of corruption.  <br /> <br />Formed as one part of a trio, along with the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank was to fund the re-development of Europe and Japan after World War II. As time went on, it became the lender of last resort to developing countries and in a perpetual tug of war between the left and right views.  <br /> <br />Wolfensohn, is a brilliant, vain, well-meaning, short-tempered, self made multi-millionaire. He took over determined to remake the World Bank. He came up against a very messy reality of governments that didn't work, and problems almost beyond comprehension let alone solution.  <br /> <br />The resulting book is an eye-opening presentation of the challenges and contradictions of the West's efforts to enlarge the world's wealth. Very well written, you will come away from this book with an entirely different view of the world. Excellent.	2004-10-26

I was most interested in the way he was treated by his captors. And on the whole it wasn't too bad. They were not evil personified as one might have expected from the beheadings performed by others. In fact, they treated his wounded arm with surgery and antibiotics. His captors were not exactly friendly, they certainly didn't turn him loose, but nor were they unduly hostile.  <br /> <br />This book is about a particular incident in a nasty situation, but most important the book is about the people involved. Both Mr. Hamill, and his captors are no longer the cardboard figures you see on TV. They are all real people. It's great to get such an in depth view.	2004-10-26

One solution was to use an Access front end to the SQL Server database engine. While this enabled the user to write reports easily, the overall system was somewhat of a kluge. Other alternatives were, of course to take the data out of the database and then write a reporting program in some other language. All in all, getting a suitable report was somewhat of a chore.  <br /> <br />This is really a 'how-to' book on the use of SQL Server's new Reporting Services. It is written from a standpoint of not just repeating the product documentation that comes from Microsoft, but from the view of the developer who has to implement a solution.  <br /> <br />It used to be that a report was basically a printed document. But now, this view has changed, and Reporting Services incorporates not only printed reports, but also reports that are to be web distributed, or as the information content for an OLAP application, enterprise level reports, or subscribed reports thatt are to be distributed automatically. This should be the only reporting services book you'll need - until of course the new versions of RS become available.	2004-10-26

Hibernate, the software system that is the heart of the book is (in my mind at least) the glue that goes between Java and a SQL database. You should have some experience with both Java and SQL to begin to understand the power that Hibernate brings to the table.  <br /> <br />Once you have that down, then this book becomes well worth the cost. It's true that Open Source projects, such as Hibernate, have on-line documentation. But that documentation is written differently than a book. It is aimed at a different audience, and often doesn't have the consistent front to back approach that a well thought out book has.  <br /> <br />This book is an excellent example. While the on-line documentation is good, (Mr. Bauer, one of the authors is in charge of the on-line documentation) the book is better. It begins with a description of what you are trying to do (often left out in computer books) and leads you on in a consistent manner through the entire Hibernate system. Excellent Book!	2004-10-26

This book assumes that you have zero experience with what routing is, how it works, what's the addressing structure or anything else. It starts off with a discussion on how to set up a snail mail system using horses, kind of like the Post Office had to use in its early days. How would you address an envelope? There is a convention that says the return address goes in the top left hand corner. But it doesn't have to be there, if we all agreed, it could be where ever we liked. But it has to be somewhere.  <br /> <br />This is the level of detail of where the book begins. After that, it goes on to a highway system. You want to mail a letter from San Jose to Chicago, what kind of addressing do you need, where does the letter stop on its way. Finally, these conventions become standardized, and we give them names. The names just happen to be those of the computer protocols - surprise, surprise.  <br /> <br />By the end of the book he is discussing Border Gateway Protocols, Multicast and things like that. By then you understand that the Post Office where you started doesn't do multicast -- they don't have copiers. By then you understand how the internet addressing scheme works. You clearly understand routing and what a router does. You're ready to move on to the next step.	2004-10-22

A delightful story, especially now that I'm older than I once was. What happens when sauve, sophisticated general Jackson Monroe, who's been flying a desk for a bunch of years is shot down in the mountains of Afghanistan, surrounded by the enemy.  <br /> <br />On the fly leaf  it says that this book is loosely based on Zenophon's The Persian Expedition, perhaps, but Zenophon was in the company of ten thousand Greek mercenaries, and here there are a lot fewer. I'd say it compares better with the march/retreat led by General 'Vinegar Joe' Stillwell at the start of World War II.  <br /> <br />At any case, the story is well written, the situations, the people interesting. The author is a West Point graduate, ex-Air Force, and his military situations are well described. This is his second book. His first, also featuring Jackson Monroe, is The Silent Men.  <br /> <br />I'd suggest that you go to Amazon or your favorite supplier and get both books. Winter's coming, and when there's a big storm settle down in front of the fire for a delight.	2004-10-21

I've just watched the Presidential debates and I can't help but wonder where we got these two. Now comes Chris Wallace's book CHARACTER. He reminds me that the challenges to be faced by whomever is selected as president will not be the ones talked about in the debates. The best president will not necessarily be the smartest - Clinton was undoubtedly one of the most intelligent in recent memory and he will be remembered for his impeachment.  <br /> <br />I also find that I can't tell if Chris Wallace is a Democrat or a Republican. And that's just great. His treatment of Nixon and Reagan is just as even and fair as his treatment of Truman and Kennedy. I really like the beginning of his Introduction, \\"I'm not sure when it was that I realized everything I thought I know about being President was wrong.\\" His conclusions:  <br /> <br />Intelligence: Almost Irrelevant.  <br />Mastery of policy: Helpful.  <br />Judgment and Steadiness of Purpose: Priceless.  <br /> <br />Here are sixteen stories, varying from what in our mind is ancient (Washington and the Whiskey Rebellion) to the current election (George W. Bush and the Iraq War.) This is one of those book that should be required reading by every voter. Unfortunately I doubt that it will even make the NY Times best seller list. As a country we're rather read a Michael Moore diatribe.  <br /> <br />My final conclusion is that it's amazing that our electoral system has worked so well.	2004-10-21

And the show had real life pictures of UFO's. Then I picked up this book. It's a picture book of What Photoshop can do to an image. Based somewhat on the author's web site: Worth1000.com (As in a Picture is Worth ....), this shows what intelligent people, with good software and a somewhat strange mind can do.  <br /> <br />I see this book as having three possible uses. First you could simply leave it on the coffee table. It's a lot better than most. Second, as a beginner in Photoshop it will give you a good idea of what can be done, and to a certain extent how to do it as some of the pictures are explained. Third, if you're a Photoshop pro, one of these pictures just may give you the idea you need to illustrate that next ad or whatever it is that your customer or boss want.	2004-10-20

With the commercial market flat, or perhaps even slowing down (businesses find that for word processing you don't get any more performance out of the latest Pentium 4 than you get out of earlier machines and are upgrading much more slowly).  <br /> <br />Game playing, on the other hand, needs all the computer power that can be had. With each increase in processing and especially in video processing power the realism of the game gets better. Now with the advent of Direct X Version 9.0 the programming of games has progressed far beyond where it was when I first got involved. <br /> <br />In this book, a master of the profession covers game programming from beginning to intermediate level. He also includes a lot of software that you will need to design state of the art games. This includes: DirectX 9/0, Paint Shop Pro, gameSpace, GoldWave.  <br /> <br />With the growth of the business, the need for programmers has likewise increased. Reading this book won't guarantee you a job in the business, but without the knowledge it contains, you won't get one.	2004-10-20

Today's bands don't need one of those. A reasonably high powered Apple and Nuendo software will do more than was possible with rooms full of equipment back in 1966 when Brian's photo was taken.  <br /> <br />This book, one of the very few about Nuendo, is aimed at the Beginner to Intermediate level Nuendo user. It a good place to start, or to use as a reference book for the more advanced user. At about 500 pages, it is long enough to include everything you need to get full use out of the software, yet it is not so long and ponderous like many of the thousand page plus software books.	2004-10-20

ACT is a contact manager -- a database, letter writer, e-mail tool, activity scheduler, notepad, report writer, Internet research tool and lots more.  <br /> <br />I think that every database book somewhere says you can use a database to keep track of your contacts. Sure you can. But with ACT, the work is already done for you. And in fact more is done for you than you ever could have thought you needed. It's not just the database that makes ACT what it is, after all the database is Microsoft SQL Server. It's the understanding of what you need to keep track of about a prospect or customer. It's the understanding, before you ever thought of it, of what you'd want to communicate to that customer that makes ACT what it is.  <br /> <br />These are the things that this book tells you about. Here's the basic simple rules of how to keep tract of phone numbers, but also here's sophisticated sorting to decide what to send to whom in a mass e-mailing.  <br /> <br />The book is on ACT 2005, the newest version, and a complete re-write of the earlier ACT packages. More than 200 new features have been added, and are covered here.  It's a must have for the beginner and the pro-user.	2004-10-20

It's the heartland of America.  <br /> <br />This book, profusely illustrated and reverantly written is the story of the heartland. While it is the story of people, it's more the story of the land itself. It's the story of ancient seas, of Tyannosaurus Rex, Triceratops, and grass. Grass, seemingly engless miles of grass. Tall grass, short grass, drought resistent grass, food for the buffalo that wandered here in vast herds.  <br /> <br />Of course the book talks about man's impact on the land. Farming plants a handful of crop species, where 5,000 wild plants grow in the Great Plains.  <br /> <br />The future has to be discussed in a book like this, and for once the news is not all bad. To be sure, there are species at risk, but the overall picture is certainly one of hope.  <br /> <br />A fascinating book on an area that is rarely thought about, let along the subject of books.	2004-10-20

John Edwards in another debate was critizing the administration for using Afgan Warlords to go into the Tora Bora mountains rather than American troops. This would indeed be interesting news to the Special Forces teams that went in with the Afgan troups. It is clear that the history of the Army's Special Forces is just beginning. <br /> <br />A lot was written about the Special Forces during the Viet Nam era. Even down to songs and movies. Since then, they've been around, they were in Panama, Desert Storm, Somalia, the Balkans. Lately the center of their activities have been in Afghanistan (Yes, even at Tora Bora) and Iraq. It's clear that they are going to be around for a long time to come.  <br /> <br />This book kind of brings us up to date on what these forces have been doing for the past 15 years. It's well researche, well written and a very interesting read.	2004-10-20

When I was a kid used to produce these beutifully illustrated books about World War II. I haven't seen one of them in years. Now this book has come out. I at first thought that it was a reprint of one of the old books, but it isn't. I've seen hundreds, if not thousands of WW II photographs from all fronts. But in reading this book, I didn't recognize any of the pictures as having been used before.   <br /> <br />The book isn't heavy on strategy. For instance there is a discussion on the lack of food in Japan by the fall of 1944 due to heavy merchant shipping losses. This was not discussed in terms of the lack of emphasis on anti-submarine forces and failure to adapt the convoy system as was done in the Atlantic. This in turn was related to the Japanese concepts of supporting the fighting forces but ignoring the mere commercial side. This is a minor point, there are other books that go into strategy. The pictures that are on that page more than make up for this lack.   <br /> <br />All in all, an excellent book of a type not seen so often any more.	2004-10-20

And from that beginning, not long after basketball was invented, there has been time to develop a lot of history. A history of events, certainly, but especially a history of people: the team, the players, the coaches. <br /> <br />Dan Collins has covered Wake  Forest for the Winston-Salem Journal since 1978. He's collected a century worth of stories into this small book. It's clearly aimed at the Wake Forest fan. This is not basketball in general, this is Wake Forest basketball. Well maybe a little bit about North Carolina basketball, but not much.  <br /> <br />Beyond that, the writing is excellent, it flows quickly and is absolutely filled with amusing anecdotes.

The authors say they could have used any tree, an oak in England, a Banyon in India, but they picked a local tree, the Douglas Fir. I was attracted to this because my hundred year old house is made of Douglas Fir. And on a recent visit to Mt. St. Helens I was exposed to the absolute devestation caused by the eruption - 25,000 acres flattened, literally millions of trees blown down.  <br /> <br />At one of the visitor centers on the road up to Mt. St. Helens there is a museum operated by one of the big logging companies. To no surprise they are talking about how much better their forests are under their careful management practices. And at a first glance, this makes sense. The trees are bigger, straighter. But where is the ecological balance, the bio-diversity - it's gone.  <br /> <br />Like anything else, there are two sides to a story. We want wood for the next house we build. And it has to come from somewhere. But after reading this book, you'll never think of a tree in the same light.	2004-10-20

Certainly it's true that the terrorists who did 9/11 fit a common profile. And yes, it makes a certain amount of sense to pay more attention to young, Arabic looking males travelling alone than it does to a friend of mine -- a 70 year old almost invalid heart patient whose Nitroglycerin spray bottle broke in his suitcase. (True. He had quite a time at the Seattle airport.) To the author this is political correctness gone crazy. But profiling has been used too many times to cover racial and other bias to simply say ignore it.  <br /> <br />I think, however, that the author ignores too many other problems in his quest for profiling. For instance, I was flying from Taipei back to the US. There was a lot of talking in Chinese about something in my computer case. Eventually they found a razor - one of those throw away plastic ones just in case the airline decides to lose my baggage. After some discussion, I simply took the razor and threw it in a waste basket. On the plane they gave us a little kit of things to make the flight easier -- Yup, it included a razor just like the one that gave security such a problem.  <br /> <br />I'm afraid that I think the problem is bigger than just profiling, it's Government.	2004-10-20

For instance oil.  <br /> <br />After the oil shortages of years ago the congress passed regulations that come under the general name of CAFE - Corporate Average Fuel Economy. This said that the average fuel economy of the vehicles sold by the automobile manufactures would have to meet a specified standard. A few presidents ago this was laid aside, and the result is the Lincoln Navigator and the raft of other big SUVs.  <br /> <br />The Republicans don't like CAFE because it would hurt the profits of the big automobile companies for the next few years. The Democrats don't like CAFE because the labor unions think that it would cost them jobs over the next few years. So in all the debates not a mention of CAFE.  <br /> <br />The talked a lot about Iraq. But there was not a mention of the fact that all of a sudden we have a series of bases in a country that wasn't friendly to us. Now we have forces in the area if we need them to protect \\"our\\" oil.  <br /> <br />I was reminded of the words from 'Deep Throat' in the Woodward-Bernstein book \\"Follow the Money.\\" The new equivalent should be \\"Follow the Oil.\\"  <br /> <br />In this book Mike Ruppert talks primarily about the 9/11 attack, but he does so with oil as a constant background. Like the musical background in a mystery, oil is behind almost every facit of our life and is going to play a bigger part each year.  <br /> <br />While it's a pretty good sized book, 674 pages, I'd like to see another hundred pages or so about what's going to happen as oil continues to increase in price. What happens to us when gasoline is not the $2.01 is here today, but $5, $10 or $25 per gallon? I guess that's another book.	2004-10-19

But with Tamara Hayle you get more than a mystery. You get a sense of life in a part of America not often seen in fiction. I remember attending a play in Newark, it was in a school, where the janitor's room was protected with razor wire.  <br /> <br />If you are familiar with Tamara, go visit an old friend.

Wouldn't it be nice of your computer system could notify you immediately that you're selling a lot of something that normally sells very slowly?  <br /> <br />This is exactly the situation that Micro SQL Server 2000 Notification Services is designed to handle. It is a platform that includes a notification engine to tell selected individuals about selected changes in the information in the database. Computer systems normally work in a pull oriented architecture i.e. you go to the web and ask for the sales figures for each inventory item to see if there is an anomoly.

You also get a macro capability so that a limited amount of manipulation of this data can be done automatically. Used less frequently but which is far more powerful is the programming language Visual Basic for Applications or VBA. Built into each copy of Access for several versions VBA is there and available for use whenever needed. All that's needed is the skill to write the programs.   <br /> <br />This is a relatively small book for one on computer software, it's hardly 400 pages. The intent of the book is to get you up and running in a short period of time. It's aimed at the computer professional who use Microsoft Access in a business setting. You are not expected to be a programmer, but by the end of the book you'll be able to program using VBA and to do so quickly.  <br /> <br />When you know VBA for Access, you'll also be well on your way to knowing VBA for the rest of the Microsoft office suite. The various forms of VBA do have some changes that relate to the underlying structure of the application. But the basic structure of the language itself is the same.   <br /> <br />There's only one thing I'd like to see added in the next revision of the book, that is a list of the reserved words used by the Access database. Not knowing these has gotten me in trouble a couple of times.	2004-10-19

Commanded by Lt. Col, Terry Allen Jr. (son of Gen. Terry Allen, the commander of the Big Red One in WW II.) the Black Lions walked into a trap that would kill Lt. Col.

He is talking about a world that exists without oil. Corection, not without oil, oil will never go away, but it appears that production is at or just about at its peak. Today, like yesterday the price of oil hit a new high. The price of oil will go up some and down some, but the trend is up, and it's going to continue upward.  <br /> <br />The hell of it is, that this is no secret. Thirty years ago the Limits to Growth was published, laying out the whole senario. And the politicians know this. The Cheney Report in 2001 said, \\"Our prosperity and way of life are sustained by energy use. (E)nergy security must be a priority of US trade and foreigh policy.\\" Quoted at the beginning of Chapter 1.  <br /> <br />But I watched the Presidential debates, there was little discussion on energy. There was a lot of discussion on Iraq (one of the big oil producers - but this wasn't mentioned), there was a lot of name calling, basically a lot of discussion that seemed to amount to rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. I didn't hear a word about increasing the fuel economy of automobiles, alternate sources of energy - I must have just missed it. Our leaders certainly are looking forward to how we are going to handle this crisis.  <br /> <br />This little book deserves to be read by everyone, I doubt that it will make the NY Times best seller list. Better than anything I've seen, it lays out the choices we have to make, either consiously or they will be made for us.	2004-10-19

Yet the will of the people was perfectly expressed. Everyone simply agreed that Washington had to be the President. Four years later they had political parties, but both of them picked Washington. That was the end of the smooth sailing.  <br /> <br />In 1796 Adams and Jefferson remained on friendly terms with each other, but had their supporters do a lot of name calling (sound familiar?).  By 1800 Adams was calling Jefferson ... well, read the book. Suffice to say, the American way of politics was in full swing, has continued unabated until now and shows no sign of making significant changes in the future.  <br /> <br />I must say that I do miss the rum. When Washington was running for the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1758, there were 391 elgible voters. Washington gave them 160 gallons of rum. It's kind of a wonder just how they could vote.  <br /> <br />This is a delightful book. I remember taking American History in college, and that was pretty dull. This reads like a novel, full of interesting anecdotes while conveying the facts as well.	2004-10-18

It's a relief to see that there are still some books being published that take another view.   <br /> <br />Mr. Horowitz has taken an interesting view. From his position as one of the founders of the New Left, he is writing about here about the American far left. This group was the one that was so sympathetic to communism while it existed, and since the collapse of the Soviet Union has had no theme around which to rally. In fact Part II (out of five) of this book discusses just this. The relationship between the left wing and the communists.   <br /> <br />I find myself wondering just what it is that politicians really think. Are these beliefs really held by these people, or are they just saying things to get press coverage and political power. And I might add that this goes for the people on the far right as well as the people on the far left.   <br /> <br />As I listened to the Presidential debates this year, I was struck by the seeming hatred. The repeated statements of how bad you did. I did not come away convinced that the challengers had a better plan, only a rallying around hatred of the President. Mr. Horowitz explains a lot of the background and reasoning on the part of the left. And I have to agree with him.   <br /> <br />Remember though, the United States as a whole is not so left as the Democrats, but not so right as the Republicans.	2004-10-18

You can study and analyze something to death. And indeed after spending millions of dollars on studies and analysis Ford produced the Edsel, General Dynamics produced the Convair 880.

In the coal mines of yesterday the miners took a canary with them into the mine. If the canary fell off of its perch the miners knew they were in trouble. In this true story, twenty year old Scott Dominguez didn't have a canary when he went into a 25,000 gallen storage tank that turned out to be filled with poisonous gasses. Shortly thereafter he was pulled from the tank unconscious. He was not managed to live through the night but was severly brain damaged. In effect Scott acted as the canary himself.  <br /> <br />The tank had been used to store cyanide and phosphoric acid. When combined, these chemicals produce hydrogen cyanide, the gas used by the various states to execute 945 men and seven women in gas chambers. It has since been determined that the 7 to 15 minutes that it takes to kill a criminal is cruel and unsual punishment because the victuum suffers horrible pain for up to several minutes. Gas chambers have has been ruled unconstitutional. <br /> <br />This is a tragic story of a horrible environmental crime. The investigators took years to bring an uncaring business owner to justice finally gaining a 17 year sentence for the owner of the company.	2004-10-15

To use Ant, you construct a build file that then directs the various Java software packages to automate the building of a working application. The book starts with a simple application: compiling Java source. From here it goes on to ever more complex projects until the whole Ant language is covered.  <br /> <br />The only complaint I have about the book is the beginning. You'd better have some idea about what you are trying to do before getting started. The book gives analogies like: \\"Thing of your source code as raw materials that you are sending into a factory for processing and assembly into a product, say an automobile. ... Ant is the factory floor with all the whiz-bang gizmos.\\" What's this supposed to mean? Come on guys, we're talking about a software package, not a factory.

There are just three reasons for this: First the software is damn good. It's solid, fast, reliable and feature rich. Second, the software is basically free. Yes, you can buy support packages for it, but even if you do you are paying a lot less than for commercial packages. Third, the level of documentation that you can get for the software is as good as anything you can get for the commercial packages.  <br /> <br />This book is a good example of the latter. It is a specialized book oriented to building a database oriented web site using these two packages. It accomplishes this task exceedingly well.

While the movie was running, at this point the reviewer would point out how lighting accented Ingrid Bergman's cheeks. At that point he would point out how lighting drew your attention to Bergmand and Bogart while dark shadows in the background filled in the image but down played its importance.  <br /> <br />Over time I began to learn more about lighting as I tried different things (generally photographing industrial equipment). I learned, slowly, that you put a light here to do this, and one over there to do that. I bought a few books on the subject, but I never tied it together.  <br /> <br />Now here in one volume is the whole story. From types of lights, to where shadows should fall on a models face, from patterns in the room background to doing highlights where and how you want them.

It was there. And I've always wondered what the streets between the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the tunnel to New Jersey looked like. And in crossing from Staten Island to New Jersey on the Outerbridge Crossing it looks like there are a couple of sunken ships just to the north of the bridge. You only get a moment to look before the railing blocks the view. They're pictured here too, page 306.  <br /> <br />This spectacular book consists of aerial photographs of the entire city of New York. Photographed in color from a height of 5,500 feet, during the summer of 2003, on perhaps the clearest day in history; the photographs are both beautiful and current. Combined with the photographs are standard maps that serve as a reference to the photographs. Finally there's an index of streets that will take you to either the maps or photographs.  <br /> <br />It's clear that the people putting this together had a pretty good idea about how to do such a book, and it shows.	2004-10-13

The language was fairly well thought out to be applicable to applications as different as word processing, spreadsheets or data bases. They called it Visual Basic for Applications shortened to VBA. It has worked remarkable well. Down theough the years there have been relatively few changes to VBA.  <br /> <br />This book is on VBA as specifically oriented to the Microsoft Access database program. But if you learn Access VBA, you are not far from knowing how to use VBA on any of the other Office components. ==While this is an Access book, it is specifically on VBA, it assumes that you already know about how to build a table, and about rows and columns. It also assumes that you have some familiarty with other Access features such as building queries.  <br /> <br />Access goes to a great deal of effort to avoid having to use the underlying SQL language. There are a couple of chapters on SQL for the total beginner. In the long run, you will probably want to know more.  <br /> <br />You can't design one book to do everything in about 400 pages. This \\"dummies\\" book concentrates on VBA. That's enough for one book. It does a good job on VBA. You may want to fill out your bookshelf with Access for Dummies and SQL for Dummies.	2004-10-13

Of course I don't know anything about selling textbooks, but boy, I sure wish I'd had something like this when I was first taking physics in high school.  <br /> <br />Dr. Gay is both a professor (atomic physics) and a football fan. What happens when a heavy, fast moving player (like Warren Sapp) hits a much lighter quarterback (Doug Flutie)who is standing still? This is such a better question than a mass of blah with a speed of blah-blah, and so on. Or what was the accuracy required of Joe Montana in throwing to Jerry Rice in The Catch during SuperBown XXIII. Montana had to throw the ball at just the right speed, just the right direction, and just the right time. But how fast, how accurately, and what was the margin of error on his timing.  <br /> <br />The book is a delightful read on aspects of the game of football rarely seen.	2004-10-13

When I've looked at the elements that make up the structure I've seen steel beams with twenty-eleven layers of peeling paint. After reading this book, it will, hopefully, not be the same. The carefully selected photographs (showing a lot more cleanliness than uaual) point out the points of design that were incorporated into the original construction.  <br /> <br />An official publication of the MTS's New York Transit Museum, this profusely illustrated book makes you look at the New York Subway in a different light. Here there is beauty and elegance sufficient to make you think of the subway as a work of art in its own right. Look carefully, the signs you're looking for to tell you where you want to go may be carefully done in mosaic tile or held up by a delicate iron casting.	2004-10-13

We have all seen 'ladies of the evening' and with a certain sadness we see them as victuums 'doing what they have to do.' This book discusses instead the white slavery market that has developed with the collapse of the Soviet Union. I can't think of any better way to describe the situation than the blurb on the back cover: \\"You can buy a woman for $10,000 and you can make your money back in a week if she is pretty and she is yound. Then everything else is profit.\\"  <br /> <br />The book is written by a multiple award winning Canadian investigative journalist. He reports on numerous incidents, numerous interviews with the people involved. This includes the women themselves, the organizers, the police, and various international relief agencies that are addressing the problem.  <br /> <br />For those of us who are parents of daughters this is a most disturbing book.	2004-10-13

The relationship between the genders, daughter and father is difficult. Perhaps especially so if the father is an FBI agent trained to never talk about his work at home. This seems to mean don't talk about anything at home. The strong silent male. Combine this with the shy sensitive daughter and growing up is difficult.  <br /> <br />I suppose that it's difficult for all of us. Most of us grow out of of the family, move away and live our own lives. But most of us don't have the gift of analyzing ourselves so clearly as we grow that we can put the life on paper. This book is not like a mystery that you can't put down. But it's so well written that you develop an empathy that makes you want to help the girl along.	2004-10-13

But you don't have much space to write down that Alison's little boy is named Kevin, that he turned five on the 23th of last month, or that Alison told you to call her back on the 5th of next month for a big order. And sending out an e-mail to those of your customers who will be interested to know that your Model 14 just came out in a new color is a bit of a chore.  <br /> <br />Act automated this process by essentially building a nifty contact oriented front end to a database.

This made me turn the pages back to the beginning of that chapter and read it. Then I turned the page and the next chapter was Henry Fonda. I was getting tired of standing up so I took it home with me.  <br /> <br />The author has been working with actors virtually all of his life. And he has done this, not as a reporter, but as one of their own. He's acted, directed, written, just about everything in the movie business. In this book he is not writing from second hand reports, he knew and associated with the people he is writing about. Well in a few cases he knew people around them, like Arthur Miller, Marilyn Monroe's husband.  <br /> <br />This book has 25 chapters, one each for 25 of the most memorable people Hollywood has produced.	2004-10-13

Who would have thought that in 76 A.D. Rome had a newspaper named the Daily Gazette that came complete with a gossip column? Who would have thought that Rome had a newspaper at all? What, they hand wrote it on scrolls? Ok, so it's a little stretch of the imagination. But at least it's not written in Latin.  <br /> <br />Linsey Davis writes with an interesting mix of the ancient with the present. If you're not going to write in Latin, you had just as well bring the rest of the language up to date as well, as in \\"Too right, my boy!\\"  <br /> <br />The story is about Marcus Didius Falco a private detective, a private informer, is on a case involving the writer of the gossip column, who has vanished.

The old analog cell phone systems got us started with the idea of being able to talk anywhere. And if we could talk, we could send data. And if this worked, then the newer digital networks had to be designed from the ground up with a mixture of voice and data. Now we are reaching to the point where wireless may become a serious competitor to land lines for data communications. Already we see wireless networks in Starbucks and McDonalds, hidden below the surface are ATM machines, gas pumps, cash registers and more. The new IEEE 802.16 is bringing standardization to wireless broadband access, just as DSL and cable modem broadband.   <br /> <br />This book is a snapshot of the technology of wireless data communications technology as it exists today. It is intended for the person who is thinking about or planning on the installation of a wireless data network. Part of the McGraw-Hill Professional Engineering series, it is a description of the technology itself. It is not a cookbook of the buy one of these and plug it into one of those types. It goes into the details of how the technology works. It describes all of the new buzz words. It is an introduction to Wi-Fi and WiMAX, but is not aimed at the total beginner or the shall we say technologically challenged.	2004-10-13

I've lived in the Louisiana Swamps. And when I arrived in the small desert town of Winnemucca, Nevada I suddenly knew that I was home at last. So it was with great delight that I found Doug Fine saying that when he got Alaska he knew he was home.  <br /> <br />The differences between here in the desert and the snows of Alaska are significant - temperature being a big one. Or maybe it's not such a big difference. After all, being outside at the middle of the Alaskan winter is not too different than being outside on a 110+ summer day. Both of them make you want to crave the inside of a nice comfortable bar.  <br /> <br />What I don't have is the sense of vision, the ability to convey the ironic, the writing style to find hilarity in the middle of catastrophe. ==You really don't have to go to Alaska to get a kick out of his life in a one room cabin, trying to survive the hardest winter since whenever, a three mile walk to school, uphill both ways - you know the story, it's the way its told that makes it a delight.	2004-10-12

There are two things that make this one unique. First is that it really is intended for the complete beginner. Many, if not most of the other C++ books assume that you have some programming experience and that now you are just looking to brush up your skills on learning this new language. What I'm saying is that this book includes the first sixty or so pages that most computer books don't have. These are the pages that explain just what it is that you are trying to do. Second is that it includes a free C++ compiler. By including the compiler you have much greater assurance that the examples being discussed will really run.  <br /> <br />What's really important in this kind of book is the writing style. It is so easy to get bogged down in the technical aspects that you tend to forget that the reason you're really there is to solve some kind of real world problem. The author is able to come up with example problems that are easy to see would be applicable in a variety of situations. He first discusses the problem, using real world terms, then goes on to the programming aspects.  <br /> <br />As the sub-title says, this is indeed a beginner's guide that makes you feel smart.	2004-10-12

There's a tree right outside my window. It looks like a tree, seen one seen all of them. But Ansel Adams didn't just see a tree.  <br /> <br />Sure he saw a tree. But he also saw its shape, the texture of its bark, it's setting, perhaps the brook flowing by, or the mist or the clouds, maybe the mountain in the background. And the timing. This picture has the sun directly behind the trunk of the tree so it's almost just an outline. That picture was taken at dawn so the light would be just so, and the mist not quite gone. This grove of trees are all tall and straight, that single Jeffrey Pine growing out of the rocks in Yosemite is twisted and deformed by the wind.  <br /> <br />You know what to expect of an Ansel Adams book.

But I never thought to write them down and then to compile them into a book.  <br /> <br />David Wyatt did. He noted his thoughts, his observations of other people and discussions. He has combined these into an awesome tale. It is not a tale of the heroic. It is not a politically motivated diatribe dripping with hatred like Fahrenheit 9/11. Somewhat autobiographical, this book is also a reasoned yet emotional and reflective essay on the way our world changed on 9/11.  <br /> <br />I have the feeling that this book is too emotional, too thoughtful to be the all time best seller on the incident. I also have the feeling that when many of the other books have faded away this one will remain.	2004-10-12

I got this book because it is so much better than the superficial descriptions given at the visitors centers. The book also has a much better story. It talks more about the details of what happened. Drawing show the inside of the volcano and what happened to make the eruption occur the way it did. All in all, a much better understanding of the mountain than I got visiting it.  <br /> <br />The mountain is not exactly unique, but the lateral blast came as a real surprise to the volcanologists. Only in retrospect did what happened make good sense. The previous eruptions created a solid rock cap on the top of the mountain. The cap was strong enough and heavy enough that it successfully held the pressure. Like the proverbial irresistible force the side of the mountain swelled up and eventually fell away. When that happened the plug at the top of the mountain fell down opening up the channel to the top. Now they know how those previously discovered horseshoe shaped craters are made.  <br /> <br />What you don't get from the book is the sense of magnitude that you get from visiting the site. You really can't imagine the blown over trees that go on for literally miles. The answer is simple. First, read the book. Second, go visit the mountain. Third, read the book again and you'll pick up a lot more.	2004-10-12

The sub-title of this book is Understanding and Mastering Concurrent Programming and I think that this pretty well sums up what it's all about. In perhaps its simplest and most obvious task consider a word processing system. Periodically you want to save what you've typed. So you hit Control-S or whatever, and then you wait until the save is completed before you can continue typing. If the save routine and the data input routine were written using threads, both could run at once and you wouldn't have to wait to continue typing. That's a pretty trivial example compared to something like a web server where you get a request, prepare a page to be displayed and then send it out to the browser that made the request. If this had to be done sequentially, the resulting server would be slow; very, very slow. And since most communications channels are so much slower than the processor, you'd best have several threads running just to handle the transmission of the page.  <br /> <br />These are simple to understand threads. And the first one, saving and typing are fairly simple to program. To get suitable performance out of a web server, you want some pretty good programmers. No one is going to claim that programming in threads is the easiest kind of program to write. But it can be argued that programming threads in Java is easier than just about any programming language. This is especially true with the additions made in Java 2 Standard Edition Version 5.0 (J2SE 5.0).  <br /> <br />This book is not intended to be your first Java book. You need to know the Java syntax, philosophies, and have some experience in programming. But having said that, most of the Java programming books skip over threads or treat them very superfically. This book picks up where those books leave off. It's intended for the intermediate level programmer up to advanced. And it's an O'Reilly book, they don't do bad stuff.	2004-10-12

The United States has a culture that accepts and rewards invention better than anywhere else in the world, and this is combined with a huge market capable of accepting the volumes of product that are needed to establish a viable business and the capital markets that can fund it.   <br /> <br />The author of this book is a contributing writer to MIT's Technology Review. He used this background to have discussions with a few dozen inventors and to consolidate their thoughts into this book. The book is a bit different from other books in the invention catagory in that it also discusses such things as why the particular invention is good, and why it makes business sense. Some of the discussions in the book deal with things like the law suits that come from trying to enforce the patent rights of inventions.   <br /> <br />At a time when the companies are getting bigger, they are also getting less able to invent. This is an interesting book on JUICE, the creative fuel that drives the inventor.	2004-10-07

It discusses houses in the $150,000 to $200,000 range that have been customed designed to fit the needs and desires of the owners. It covers some 20 houses in detail. The special conditions caused by legal restrictions, difficult building lots, everything is discussed. Of special interest is the discussion and illustration of using standard stock components, many of them industrial in intent in innovative ways to reduce the cost of the house by thousands of dollars. While doing so, the designers have been careful to integrate these components with standard structures to produce a home both inexpensive yet customized to the needs of the owner both functionally and in appearance.	2004-10-07

In this book the concentration is on the intersection between scientific disciplines. How does a study of the foraging behavior of ants lend clues to large-scale business problems like factory scheduling and telecom routing? This is not to say that specialization is not important or necessary, you want a doctor that is a specialist on exactly the problem you have, and in building a semi-conductor you need specialists in that field. But the author contends that hte broad new ideas will come from breaking down barriers between departments in the university, in business and in cultures.   <br /> <br />We all know that there are huge problems facing the world today: energy after oil, global warming, AIDS, just to name a few. They will not be solved by one technology. Energy involves everything from finding oil (and its replacement) to designing cars, to what to do about the mundane filling station that now sells only gasoline. There's no distribution system to provide for electric or hydrogen cars. The answers will come from multiple fields of study.	2004-10-07

When the detective in the mystery has a manservant named Jock Strapp, you get a pretty good idea of what to expect. It's a detective story, well sort of as the hero is not all that honest himself, even when he's sober. So you combine the stolen paints, the secret police, a dead client, and the obligatory ravishing young widow -- and it's hard to make a dishonest living.   <br /> <br />This is the first of a series of British mysteries beginning in 1972. It's written by an art dealer. But as the introduction says, This is not an autobiographical novel: It is about some other portly, dissolute, immoral and middle-aged art dealer. The rest of the characters are quite imaginary too, especially that Mrs. Spon, but most of the places are real.   <br /> <br />Popular enough to have assumed almost cult status in England, I'm glad to see that it's finally crossed the pond.	2004-10-07

This year the stories range from Federal Government miss-deeds, inactions, and sneeky laws to actions by the media, large corporations and more. The stories are what you are not going to find on the evening news or on newspaper headlines, some samples: Widow Brings RICO Case Against U.S. Government for 9/11; The Media Can Legally Lie; U.S. Develops Letal New Bioweapon Viruses; Law Enforcement Agencies Spy on Innocent Citizens; Reinstating the Draft and so on.They are fascinating stories that while true just don't make it.  <br /> <br />I find myself wondering why these kinds of stories don't make it. There is a suspicion on the parts of the editors that there is a conspiracy to prevent these news items from being shown. On the other hand, they are dull compared with the latest splatters of blood on the ground from an explosing in Iraq, Israel, or where ever. There's an old saying, if it bleeds it leads. Certainly as Peter Philips says in the Preface, the news is being Dumbed Down. The race for ratings points has taken over from the idea of supplying the news that's needed to make a democracy work. The news is certainly covering the politicians as this is a Presidential election year. But the politicians are just attacking each other, not saying at all what they would do themselves that's different, or saying that they have a plan which they then don't discuss.  <br /> <br />After the 25 big stories, there are 14 chapters on updating stories from the previous years, or on stores requiring more in depth treatment.  <br /> <br />You don't learn what's happening until the books come out, and this is one of the key book.	2004-10-06

But the fleeting moment had passed, and even by asking I've missed the next things that was said. Thank God for the printed word that lasts forever and sits on the shelf to be reviewed as needed. ==Here are some three dozen transcripts of interviews. Some of which you undoubtedly missed. Some of which are artfully edited from multiple broadcasts. The editing though was carefully done to not change the tone of the interview, nor does it appear that Ms. Gross has taken the opportunity to make herself look better. ==As you would expect, some of the interviews are more interesting to me than others. You may of course, not find the same ones of interest. But if you like the show, you will like the book, basically a transcript of the interviews	2004-10-05

May 11, 1998 started off like any other, the usual meetings, then CNN announced that India had set off a nuclear device. In that instant India moved many steps up the priority level.  <br /> <br />Over the next couple of years Mr. Talbott and Jaswant Singh the Indian Minister of External Affairs met fourteen times in seven countries. These meetings discussed not only the nuclear issue but the wider visions of the U.S. - Indian relationship. This ultimately lead the groundwork for Bill Clinton's trip to India in March of 2000.  <br /> <br />This is a classic example of why you have to wait for the books to come out before you have any idea of what's really going on. The daily newscasts, even the weekly talking heads and news magazines do not cover the depth and analysis that the actual participants can give to a story after they have had a year or two to think about what happened.  <br /> <br />In this case the story is about a historical moment little known to the general public. Yet it is a moment that could have flared into something much more serious. Just two weeks after the Indian test Pakistan responded with its own test.

I haven't done one on two wheels in quite some years, since before she was born, my pickup with a matress in back is much more my style now. But every year or two I get the urge to go somewhere a few thousand miles away. Given three months between jobs, what better way could Karen Larsen have spent the time than to get on a bike and go 15,000 miles.   <br /> <br />I agree with her completely that you need some time alone just letting the miles go by. At the same time you find yourself talking to people just as though they were there. And when you go find an interesting site, perhaps a National Park, parhaps just a pretty spot on the road you want to share it.  I have never had an unknown father to look up, but stopping off to see friends from the far past is a truly excellent way to spend an evening.   <br /> <br />Now I'm getting the urge to go somewhere: Death Valley, the coast of Nova Scotia.

The case went on for twenty years until a new DNA matching technique was available and used to identify Gary Ridgway. He later confessed to killing 48 women, and is suspected of killing an addition twenty or more.   <br /> <br />This extraordinary book chronicles the search for the killer, but in doing so it brings great humanity to the murdered girls and their families.

When you hire someone to do some work around the house, cut your hair, or bring food to you in a restaurant; you really don't want someone that's too dumb. Otherwise you house, your hair, or your food isn't right. But we have been conditioned to think that these kinds of workers do not need any brainpower.   <br /> <br />In this book, Mike Rose, a member of the faculty of the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies grew up in a working class family and witnessed first hand the skills it takes to do the manual work about which he writes.   <br /> <br />With that a basis, he begins to look at intelligence in a new, broader sense. Perhaps our traditional IQ tests are wrong. And if we think of these workers, these people as being not too bright, then we shut down opportunities for advancement and it makes you think seriously about how people will vote in the upcoming presidential election.   <br /> <br />This is a seminal book. It establishes several points, but it is just a first step. How should we change education to be more meaningful to people who are just as smart but not oriented the same way. Are the traditional three R's simply not applicable? If not, what should we do? We don't want to condemn people who are just slow starters on the traditional path, yet we want to provide the best education possible for all.	2004-09-30

In that book, the ways Alexander ruled his kingdom 2,500 years ago are analyzed, presumably to give pointers to those would manage an enterprise today.  <br /> <br />In spite of the awe in which Alexander has been held, there hasn't been a major new biography in quite a while. This new book by Paul Cartledge fills this niche perfectly. It might be argued that a biography of one who lived 2,500 years ago isn't likely to make new discoveries. And yes, the main points of the story, his father Philip, his battles, his death are the same. But the view we have of such a person changes. We view things from a more psychological standpoint. What were the passions that drove him to conquer the world? What was his personality, his goals? How was he a product of his times? How did his existance effect our world? The sub-title of the book, The Hunt for a New Past implies a distinctive interpretative approach, and that the book provides. Highly recommended.	2004-09-30

This new story is Cosmos brought up to date with the latest discoveries and theories, and done without so much of the 'Wow, how marvelous' that Sagan used.   <br /> <br />Of particular interest to me was the discussion on the likelyhood of extra-terrestrial life in the Universe. Obviously no conclusion can be reached because we have not made contact with any other civilization, but on the other hand, it is impossible to prove a negative.

He crossed the river, got a horse and went to their house. Shortly after giving them this message he was captured by the British. The resulting interrogation was the most important part of the night for him. He also mentioned that a second rider, Mr. William Dawes was also sent out and carried the same message to Adams and Hancock. In his report there is no mention of 'one if by land, two if by sea.' In 1861 the Longfellow poem was published, eight-six years after the fact. And this is what we remember.  <br /> <br />The Paul Revere chapter is one of thirteen in this book that attempts to show real, documented truth as it actually happened rather than the way the stories are handed down today. It is well written, and the knowledge that the people founding the country were real people not gods does no damage to the story of the founding of the U.S.  <br /> <br />Do you suppose that the reason there are thirteen stories is to give one to each colony?	2004-09-30

What would an Islamic terrorist be willing to do to have proof that Christianity is a false religion. -- OK that's the premise.  <br /> <br />Now you have to take into account that this is a spy novel.

An easy way to get a lesson in world economics. The trouble is that I'm not so sure the lesson is correct. For instance, we import a laptop computer that's made in the far east. The production of that computer is fiercely competitive, there's almost no margin in its manufacture. But Microsoft gets about $100 for the Windows software that comes with it. And the profit to Intel for making the CPU is significantly higher than the profit on manufacturing the computer. Given a choice we should be far more concerned with getting these high profit components of the computer rather than manufacturing the computer itself.   <br /> <br />OK, I agree with that. This is fine if you're a software engineer at Microsoft or a chip designer at Intel. But what if just an ordinary guy, trying to make a living, perhaps at a blue collar job? With the shipment of the manufacturing overseas, a lot of those kinds of jobs have been eliminated. Then again, look at the overall unemployment rate, it's quite low. Obviously the U.S. economy is finding some kinds of jobs for all kinds of people.   <br /> <br />In this book, Andy Kessler says that we've moved beyond industrialization into an intellectual property economy. It's a point that needs to be considered, and besides that his book is a delight to read. His comedy like reporting makes the economics lesson go down easily.	2004-09-30

By 1945 the US pilots were going into battle after just about a year of training. In contract the German and Japanese pilots had only a couple of weeks training. This tradition, for the US, at least continues. The training of a pilot for the F-16 is a long process on top of a history of excellence.  <br /> <br />This book is the story of a group of F-16 trainees going through the transition to the F-16. They are already pilots, but of planes with less performance. They are already the elite, the best of the best. And now the Air Force is preparing to spend $2 million on each of them for a six month class. The writing in the book almost makes it read like a novel. And the author admits that he has combined some of their stories into single people. This does not hurt the tone, nor the image that you get of the fighter mentality that the Air Force demands.

In conflicts after that (Grenada, Panama) the press was kept at a distant arms length. In the second Iraq war, the Pentagon granted some 2,700 reporters press credentials. About 600 of these were embedded with U.S. military units. And as all of us who watched the war, the coverage was sensational.  <br /> <br />This book consists of interviews with the embedded journalists. They were conducted after the war after the reporters had had time to think about what had happened. About 60 of the embedded reporters have contributed to this book, that's almost ten percent of all the reporters. (I note that Geraldo Rivera who was expelled from the program for revealing future military plans is not included in the interviews).

Anyone can claim to be an expert on any software package. To provide some standardization of such claimes, the certification process was developed. Now you can get certified on nearly any software package. And Linux is no exception.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the best known (non-version specific) Linux certification is the one from Linux Professional Institure Certification or LPIC. It's also probably the most difficult. It's a test you take on a computer, so you can get your score just after you walk out of the testing room.  <br /> <br />This book is specifically oriented to the test. It is only incidentally about Linux. It is not a guide on how to install Linux or use it, it's a guide on passing the test. It's part of the Exam Cram series and makes no bones about it's purpose being to pass the tests. Both the LPIC 101 and 102 tests are covered. A CD-ROM is included that has a simulation of the actual exams. Like the exams, the simulation has about 300 questions, and 45 of these are selected each time you take the test.

In 1924 the Klu Klux Klan was the largest and most powerful organization in Indiana. It boasted 350,000 members, one out of every three white men in the state. Among the many groups hated by the Klan was the Catholic church, whom they hated and feared because they were seen an aliens in a Protestant America.  <br /> <br />On May 17th, thousands of Klansmen converged on South Bend with the intention of terrorizing the students of Notre Dame. A riot developed between the Klan and the students with the students eventually gaining the upper hand. This was the climax of the Klan's existence.   <br /> <br />Within little more than a year, D. C. Stephenson the head of the Klan in Indiana was convicted of murder. From prison he engineered the release of documents that detailed the close relationship the Klan had with various elected officials, many of whom wound up in prison. Within another year membership in the Klan had fallen to 15,000. ==This book is well written, making the historical events come alive with his excellent characterizations of the key players and fast moving story.	2004-09-29

Perhaps not unlike other ethnic groups, Chinese have tended to marry Chinese. In this story, Carnegie Wong, a second-generation Chinese American is married to Blondie, decided not Chinese.  <br /> <br />Dead and presumably gone is Mama Wong, Carnegie's mother, eternally opposed to his marriage. Mama Wong is gone, but not forgotten. In comes Lan, a mainland Chinese relation who Mama Wong has arranged to come 'to look after the kids.' I am reminded that the Chinese symbol for trouble is two women under one roof.  <br /> <br />Gish Jen is likewise a daughter of Chinese immigrants. A Harvard graduate, she is also the recipient of a Lannan Award in the amount of $75,000 to honor her work of exceptional quality. Gish Jen is proof that the excellent American, or should I say Chinese-American novel is not a thing of the past.	2004-09-29

Quite a number of books with something like that in their name deal with the life of an artist. This one, instead, deals with the life of Joseph Duveen, art dealer.   <br /> <br />Joseph Duveen lived at a time when the established order was changing. He made an early observation that while Europe had the art, America had the money. As head of Duveen Brothers (London, Paris, New York) he set up an organization finding hundreds of the Old Masters in Europe and selling them to American collecters. The list of his customers reads like a Who's Who of the American rich: Mellon, Frick, J. P. Morgan, Huntington, Kress, Hearst and many, many more.   <br /> <br />The book is largely based on the Duveen Archive. Held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the archive was locked away and hidden. Only recently has the archive been transferred to the Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities in Los Angeles. There a decision was made to make the archive available on microfilm for study. The archive consists of the documentation that accompanied the business: letters, cables, photo albums, ledgers, sales books, stock books, etc. These kinds of documents are the life blood of a business and in this case enable the author to have unparalleled insight to how the business operated. This is combined with a knac for story telling that makes the dead business documents come alive.	2004-09-29

His task is being complicated by the letters the killer is sending to the local newspaper, which publishes them.

She's calling from the sanitarium where she has been imprisoned for the past eight years for attempted murder -- his.  <br /> <br />To 'help' him, Detective Challis has a crew of helpers. It's not at all certain that they are more help or trouble.

This one is different. In its almost a thousand pages it talks about only a hundred twenty five schools. As the sub-title says, this book talks about America's Top Schools. Here you'll find several pages on Cal Tech and six of the University of California schools. But you won't find San Jose State. You'll find Brigham Young, but not the University of Utah.<br /><br />Again unlike many college guides, this book does not just say complimentary things about the schools. LSU's theater is described as - dirty, depressing, dilapidated and demoralizing.<br /><br />If you're looking at the big name schools, the information provided here will be of great value in helping you to decide if this particular school is for you.	2004-09-27

When you look at these screens you are presented with a bewildering array of optional settings. They are all, of course, clearly identified with some kind of gibberish like AGP to DRAM Prefetch.  <br /> <br />This book is organized so that inside the front and back covers are a listing of the BIOS options. Looking up AGP to DRAM Prefetch you are told that there is a Quick Review on Page 40 and a Detailed Description on Page 169. And after a little reading you will understand what this option does, and why you probably want it enabled. About 250 BIOS options are explained in this manner. There have been many times in the past when having such a book would have been invaluable. It is clearly written using words that will make sense to the computer literate and those maybe one step above novice.	2004-09-27

During the first public demo, the system crashed and the machines just sat there.  <br /> <br />The poll workers, in their training on the machines had been shown a yellow button on the back of the machine (Reset). They were told repeatedly -- this button is your friend. The yellow button got pushed, it didn't do anything. A bunch of us computer types started to chuckle. The people from the voting machine company didn't think it was very funny.  <br /> <br />While the voting machine people were powering down and restarting the machine, a county official got up to talk about bi-lingual voting. You have to have bi-lingual voting. And somewhere up the chain of command a decision was handed down that we had to make our machine bi-lingual. So far so good.  <br /> <br />By census records, I guess, some power that existed somewhere their made the decision that the second language on our machines had to be Piute indian. Well OK. Then they went to get the ballots translated. The Piute indians don't have a written language, and is only spoken by a few elderly people. What do we do now? No bi-lingual and we violate the federal election rules. Will all the ballots here be thrown out because of this technicality? Can we do the bi-lingual in Spanish which would really help the Hispanic people or does Piute have to be it?  <br /> <br />This book is a about the upcoming election. It's about 2/3 fiction. The story is about 250 pages long. The next third of the book is non-fiction, and is about the technology behind the novel. It has chapters on the history of voting, voting machines, cryptography, buffer overflows, and steganography. These aren't as bad as they sound as they are closely tied to the novel. The explanations are quite simple and clear.  <br /> <br />Finally there is a CD-ROM in the book. The CD contains just three files. When successfully decrypted more files are revealed. Finally if you can hack the CD, you become elgible for a prize being offered by the publisher.  <br /> <br />Oh yes, the novel. It's a mystery with a current theme. If all the voting is being done electronically, it might be possible the hack into the voting systems and hack the Presidency. The hero is speaking at a security conference and just after his speech he is handed a CD that ... well, I'll leave you to guess the rest.	2004-09-27

One such period was the Renaissance in Italy that ended the dark ages. Another happened in the 18th century. This period is called the Period of Enlightenment. It began in the early to mid 1700's and ended with the revolutions in America and France at the end of the century.  <br /> <br />This was the period of time that gave us much of the philosophical underpenning of our time: Adam Smith and the Wealth of Nations; John Wesley and Methodism; Jefferson, Adams, John Licke and Edmund Burke.  <br /> <br />Dr. Himmelfarb writes this book on this period of time to discuss the Enlightenment as it happened in England, France and America. Her view is that while the Enlightenment has been considered as primarily a French happening, the American and particuarily the British contributions were probably more significant. After all, the French revolution was a disaster that led the guillotine, to Napoleon and a war that covered the western world.	2004-09-24

This book, the third in a series discusses the divisions numbered from 11 to 23. Each division has a narrative description of when it was formed, where the soldiers came from, specialized insignia, and a brief description of what each division did during the war up to its final point of surrender. It is beautifully illustrated with great attention to detail as to uniforms and equipment.  <br /> <br />The 11 to 23 divisions were primarily formed of foreign troups. #11 for instance was the Nordland division composed of troops from Norway, Denmark, Netherlands. They fought on the the eastern front against Russia. They were still fighting around the Reichs Chancellery on May 1st, 1945, the day that Hitler's death was announced.	2004-09-24

You can't tell what is going on in the Government until people leave and write books. Paul O'Neill, Bush's first Secretary of the Treasury is the first cabinet level member of the administration to leave. His departure was not his choice, he got fired. Consequently you can guess that he had problems with the Administration and that his book is not exactly complimentary.   <br /> <br />A good bit of the book concerns the decision making process in the White House. This has been an interesting area of study for many years. Reagan apparently would state the overall policy at the beginning of the meeting, eat a few jelly beans and take a nap. At the end of the meeting he would wake up to find out what they had decided to do. Carter and Clinton were intimately involved in the smallest details of any decision. Carter left us with the memory of the Iranian Hostage disaster, Clinton got impeached.   <br /> <br />It appears that George W. looks at what his father did. George Senior made a series of decisions that cost him his base of support from the conservative wing of his party, and he did not get re-elected. As you read this book, and if you have any interest at all in the American political proces you should, keep in mind that George W. is going to protect his conservative base regardless of anything else.	2004-09-24

While it is a story still unfolding it is just now that the books are beginning to come out. You have to wait for the books because the news programs are so bad, the expression 'if it bleeds it leads' seems true.  <br /> <br />Jon Lee Anderson had a different view of the war. He was in Baghdad before the war started and stayed there through the American takeover. This perspective is quite diffferent than those of the embedded reporters covering the war from the viewpoint of the military units. He knew and indeed was friends with a number of Iraqi citizens. He wrote a series of stories for the New Yorker magazine which became the foundation for this book. His stories and more important his analysis provides a stabalizing viewpoint in a situation that is certainly confusing to those of us looking at it from have a world away.	2004-09-24

There was 9/11 that killed more people than any other workplace disaster. But there was also 1911 and the Triange Waist Fire. As with 9/11 this fire marked a turning point. The fire lasted only about a half hour. It killed 146 workers, most of them young immigrant women.  <br /> <br />The book tells the story well, not only the few minutes of the fire itself, but setting the scene in the context of its time. Fire sprinklers had been invented by then, but there was no incentive to install them. The insurance companies charged the same if they were installed or not. The exit doors were locked, because of the owners fear that the employees might steal things.  <br /> <br />In an interesting manner, the author traces the aftermath of the fire to the establishment of the Democratic party as the champion of urnan liberalism and elevated F.D.R. to the Presidency.	2004-09-24

It's about outsourcing the IT function along the lines of EDS, IBM's Global Services, or Oracle On Demand. As president of Oracle On Demand, most of the busines stories concern successful contracts where Oracle On Demand has set up or replaced the IT department in a number of companies. What the title means is that the end user does not buy the software, he buys the service provided by that software. There's still an awful lot of software involved.  <br /> <br />There are clear advantages to this kind of outsourcing. The big outsourcing companies have exonomies of scale, they can buy dozens or thousands of computers, all just alike.  This minimizes the maintenance effort, they can upgrade the software on all units cheaper than a company can do it on a few machines. It improves reliability, they can use this machine if that one is broken. They can fully understand the laws, such as the privacy laws relating to human resources information. And they have many other advantages.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately this does come with some disadvantages as well. For one thing, they use standardized software packages, if your application fits, that's great, otherwise, well....  <br /> <br />Then you have to be of the right size. Too small and they're not interested. Too large and you probably have your own legacy systems that switching off may lose you a lot of historical information.  <br /> <br />This is an interesting book, well worth reading if you are in the IT department of a middle sized business. It clearly explains the advantages of the outsourcing business model.	2004-09-24

The 49th Fighter Group certainly qualifies as an elite unit. Less than a month after Pearl Harbour they were sent to the South Pacific flying P-40's in the defense of Darwin, Australia. They fought up the island hopping campaign until the wars end in 1945 when they were preparing to move to Okinawa for the invasion of Japan itself. Beginning at the end of 1942 the P-40's were gradually replaced with P-38's and P-47's. The most famous Ace of the 49th was Richard Bong - 40 victories. By the end of the war, the 49th as a whole had scored 668 aerial victories.  <br /> <br />About half story and half photographs, the book is profusely illustrated with wartime photographs of the aircraft, people and the places where the 49th operated.

We are all familiar with Clinton's lies, made under oath, about Monica, which got him impeached. Nixon, of course resigned over the lies regarding Watergate. This book, exhaustively researched concentrates on four specific incidents.  <br /> <br />The first incident concerns Yalta, the Churchill-Stalin-Roosevelt conference at the end of WW II. At this meeting Roosevelt made concessions to Stalin that he subsequently expected to change. But he died ten weeks later and left the presidency to Truman who had not been at the conference and had not been informed of the deal that Roosevelt had cut. The result was the cold war, causing an immense amount of treasure and even lives over the next fifty years.  <br /> <br />Second he describes the secret deal cut by Kennedy in regards to the Cuban Missile Crisis. This enhanced the Cold War and helped pave the way for the Viet Nam war.  <br /> <br />Third is Lyndon Johnson's version of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents. These provided the basis for the congressional resulutions that allowed the United States to send an army to Viet Nam.  <br /> <br />Finally is the Iran-Contra strategy of Ronald Reagan. At one meeting Reagan was told that his announcements might constitute an impeachable offense. He replied, they can impeach me if they want, visiting day is Wednesday.  <br /> <br />I write this in the midst of the new presidential campaign. Kerry has just spoken out about Assault Rifles with the ability to kill dozens of people at a time, while the only thing in the legal definition that makes an assault rifle more deadly is the ability to attach a bayonet on the end. And Bush, well the fact that one of his press aids said, The President is not a fact-checker, just about says it all.	2004-09-23

Here we have a young man, John Milk inexperienced in life. He goes to work for an entomologist who has been studying the gall wasp. But with the gall wasp fairly well understood, the entomologist has decided to change his field of study. He's decided to study sex, and his name is Kinsey.  <br /> <br />When you combine a good concept with a good writer you get a good story. And T.C. Boyle is a good writer. Without telling you too much of the story, the Inner Circle is composed of those researchers who worked close to Kinsey.  <br /> <br />While this is a novel, it appears that the character of Kinsey is portrayed rather accurately. The book is chiefly concerned with Kinsey's obsessive pursuit of sexual knowledge, but it also comments on the nature of marriage, family and the compromises we make in the hopes of earning love, acceptance, and a living. I shall be surprised if this book doesn't head to the top of the best seller lists.	2004-09-23

And no one could possibly consider the terrorist attacks on 9/11 to be anything but a disaster. But what to change and how to change it. ==In this book, William Odom a former director of the National Security Agency looks at how the American intelligence agencies are organized and makes recommendations on how to fix the problems. The roots of the problem go back a long ways.  <br /> <br />The CIA was organized in 1947 as primarily an organization to collect information about the Soviet Union. With the advent of spy satellites the main thrust of the agency centered on using imagery to track the military forces of the Soviet Union. And as budgets were cut from time to time (under Clinton especially) the agency depended more and more on imagery.  <br /> <br />The FBI has responsibilities for both law enforcement and counter intelligence. These are very different responsibilities, one leading to arrest and trial after a crime has been committed. In counter intelligence you don't really care if the bad guy goes to jail, you mainly want to stop his actions from hurting you.  <br /> <br />Regardless of how it happened, it is time for a major overhaul of the Intelligence agencies of the U.S. General Odom has made a number of proposals clearly stating how he would do it. It will be interesting to watch what happens as Congress works on the problem.	2004-09-22

Now we have switched to clocks. But the biological clocks that are within all of us don't know how to read clocks. Breakfast, lunch and dinner occur at standard times. Tooth pain is lowest after lunch; proof reading and sprint swimming are best performed in the evening; labour pains more often begin at night and most natural births occur in the early hours; sudden cardiac death is more likely in the morning (from Chapter 1).  <br /> <br />The study of biological clocks has gone on for a long time, but as a science is a fairly recent development. Research in just the last few years has dramatically altered the way scientists view them. This book is a snapshot of the way the science appears right now. The pair who wrote the book are a leading researcher in the field and a professional science writer. This is a good combination that gives good enjoyable writing combined with accurate reporting.	2004-09-22

You went to your favorite book or computeer store and sitting on the shelf was a shrink wrapped red box that contained all you needed. You followed the directions and in a short time you had Linux running on your system. Of course back then we didn't worry much about security. HA (High Availability) was an acronym that hadn't been invented yet. MySQL was a ... Well never mind! The world simply isn't like that any more.  <br /> <br />Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is the stable, supported heavy duty version of Linux intended for stable, mission critical applications. This book clearly describes what you get with RHEL and how to utilize these components to build an enterprise level server. It presumes that you have some knowledge of Linux and probably you should have some working experience with some kind of Linux distribution. Given that, if you are a systems administrator and want to learn about RHEL, or you're now assigned a security responsibility, high availability, server farms or the like, this is for you.	2004-09-22

But in today's world the house has the old machine, which you get to use; the new powerful machine, taken over by the kids because they need the power to play todays games; there's the laptop brought home from work or school which has some files on it that would be handy to have on you desktop. There's the web cam that you'd like to have set up to monitor the baby's room, or the security of the back yard. And all of these need to interface to the one broadband connection you have to the internet.   <br /> <br />The answer is, of course, a home network. It doesn't need to have the big file server that the office has, but it certainly does need a few of its features such as a firewall to keep out those who would use your system to send out unwanted SPAM.   <br /> <br />This book, billed as the only home networking book you'll ever need, goes through the hardware and softtware you'll need to set up a home network. It is profusely illustrated, usually featuring LinkSys equipment. But the functionality of the LinkSys boxes is basically duplicated by that of other vendors, so this isn't a big problem. It's a good basic introduction, and by following it you can get a network set up.	2004-09-21

With different children different techniques work. Harvey Daniels book on Literature Circles introduced the concept of small book circles where the young readers form a small group to review a book. For many students it worked better than any previous approach.   <br /> <br />Now he, along with Nancy Steineke have expanded on this concept with a series of short, focused and practical lessons to help the groups function. The book includes just about every problem that has been experienced in working with book clubs from dealing with kids who don't do the reading to helping the shy student.	2004-09-21

This particular Game Day was Saturday, August 30, 2003 and the game was Yankees vs. Red Sox in Boston. Like the proverbial elephant being examined by a group of blind people, the way one person sees the game is entirely different than what another person sees.  <br /> <br />In this book a group of top sports reporters united to cover one game, they attempted to find out everything that happened. They each worked with one person and tried to see how that person viewed the game. They covered the mighty and powerful (owner, manager, CEO), they covered the players (on both sides), and they covered several fans. After the game they held in-depth interfiews with many of these same people to produce a better overall view. It's not just a game, it is a slice of American life.	2004-09-21

We know that we are nice people, and we are puzzled when we watch TV and see obvious evidence that there are people out there that don't like us. Until this book came along, what I had not recognized was how long this had been going on (1600's). Nor had I realized how much official Government policy in many countries, often as an excuse to cover up their own problems, is anti-American.  <br /> <br />Much of the book covers the religious aspects. In Europe America is seen as a conservative religious fanatical society. In the Islamic countries as a heathen Great Satan out to wipe out Islam. It kind of makes you wonder just why so many people seem to be willing to go to almost any extreme to come to the United States.  <br /> <br />This is a very thought provoking book, well resourced, well documented.	2004-09-21

Ms. Kellerman has analyzed several of these and identified fundamental seven types of leadership that are prone to failure.  <br /> <br />INCOMPETENT: The leader and at least some followers lack the will or skill to sustain effective action.  <br /> <br />RIGID: The leader and at least some of his followers are stiff, unyielding, and unwilling to adapt to new ideas, new information or changing times.  <br /> <br />Intemperate: The leader lacks self-control and is aided and abetted by followers who do not intervene.  <br /> <br />CaALLOUS: The leader is uncaring or unkind, he ignores or discounts the needs of the rest of the organization.  <br /> <br />CORRUPT: These people lie, cheat, or steal. They put self interest above all else.  <br /> <br />INSULAR: They disregard or at least minimize the health and welfare of those outside the small center group.  <br /> <br />EVIL: Some leaders and at least some followers commit atrocities.  <br /> <br />In each of these catagories, she identifies leaders that illustrate her point. This leads to an understanding of why such bad leadership is harmful to the organization, and if the organization is the political leadership of a country, it is bad for the world.	2004-09-21

In this book, the people in Russia have voted to bring back the monarchy. The problem now is to determine who among the distant relatives of the Tsar is next in line for the throne.  <br /> <br />But the problem is not so simple. What really happened when the royal family of Nicholas II was executed? Did a direct descendent escape being killed? It is up to Miles Lord to determine the truth and name the next Tsar.

It is based on visits to nine of the top names in college football. The author, Brian Curtis, spent a week at each school. The result is a report, not of just the games, but of the essence of the teams. He reports on the practice, the personalities, the tone of the school and the team. The tone varies a good bit depending if the last game was a win or a loss. He reports on the 'intelligence' I guess you'd call it about what the team can expect in the game plan expected from their opponents next week. And on the ways to counter the oponnents expected game.  <br /> <br />Coming through on each page is the fascination, the love that the author feels for the game and the teams.

When I went in I took four or five inches of paper, most of it generated on the computer by Quicken. Any question I was asked I simply pulled out the appropriate printout to show how I had gotten to the number I had put on the form. I can't say how much having all this documentation saved, but I suspect it was substantial.  <br /> <br />Quicken is probably the most popular generalized accounting packaged in use by individuals and small businesses. Over the years it has gotten better and better. So have the books that describe Quicken. This book describes the new Quicken 2005. The author uses the Premier version, but most of what he discusses is applicable to any version, (Premier has more stuff on handling investments). In keeping with the Dummies Books Philosophy, it is written in a light and amusing manner while providing the information needed to get the most out of the software package.	2004-09-19

It starts off making the assumption that you at least know how to turn the computer on. One thing I particularly liked was the idea of you can put this on your main PC, but you might do better (that means less chance of screwing it up) if you put it on an old retired PC. I happened to find a PC at a local thrift store for $75 that I could dedicate to the Linux OS so the family doesn't get upset when I leave the thing in a mess. The software  included with the book comes on a DVD. Or if you want you can order this software from the publisher on 9 CD-ROMs for a nominal fee.   <br /> <br />The book is advertised as being 9 books in one. And I agree. The section on open office is clearly enough to get you started on using the integrated office package that comes with the software. And the section on programming is as good as any that I've seen. It's not enough to make you a professional programmer, but it will get you through the installation, setup and first programs. All in all, quite a book.	2004-09-19

As such it makes sense to progress at work, get as much out of your job as you can, and above all else to enjoy working so that you are not spending so much time in an unplesant atmosphere.  <br /> <br />At first glance this book appears oriented to the female employee. As you read it, it is just as applicable to the male worker. The techniques, hints and tips are not gender specific. Most of them are oriented around work, but there is a chapter on the work/life balance. You don't want to grow older wondering where your life went. As the old saying goes, no one would want their tombstone to to read -- I should have spent more time at work.  <br /> <br />The book is filled with short and direct tips that say do this one thing.

The story is set in New York in the 1930's when the first waves of jewish refugees were leaving Nazi Germany and settling in New York. The story is told through the eyes of an eighteen year old orphan who enters the household of Professor Rudolf Mitwisser as his research assistant.   <br /> <br />As a rather naive, certainly unworldly young girl, Rose is intelligent and an acute observer. She reports on the interactions within the family. As a girl from the country now finding herself in the bigger world she encounters a strange set of characters thrown together in a way that makes them all refugees from something.   <br /> <br />This novel is driven by the writing and the character studies. To be sure their is a plot, and sub-plots that twist and tury, but it is the characters that define the story.  The writing is what sets the story apart. Ms Ozick has become a consumate master of English prose.	2004-09-18

Now it's become the fastest growing white collar crime in America. It strikes in every community from the smallest to the largest. The crime is profitable, nearly unpreventable, and hardly ever prosecuted (by one estimate only one out of every 700 incidents). It's the down side of the information super highway. Getting a bit of information about a person is easy, and then you can get a bit more. Soon you can buy a car in his name, get credit cards in his name, like the TV commercial, you're on the beach, your credit cards are in the airplane flying by.  <br /> <br />The book says, rightfully I believe, that you are basically on your own. The police don't seem to care, the credit card companies write off the loss and go on about their business. Just don't you try to ever use your credit again.  <br /> <br />The author is a leading expert on the subject, as well as being a senior writer at MSNBC. He knows how to write and he knows his subject, what more can you ask.	2004-09-17

But 1942 was a different kind of time for young men. Within a few months these young men were in places like Okinawa, POW camps, the authors father was flying a P-38.     This book is in part a sports story, in part a war story (one battle death had been shrouded in mystery for 60 years), and also an interresting analogy between college football and the military services. It is no accident that the size of the average sports team and the size of the basic military unit both contain about ten men. This is the group that can work well together.     This book fits right in between a sports book and a history book.	2004-09-17

Surprisingly he does make some comments about virus writers, not to specifically identify them, but to give some history and general comments. I don't know that this was a help, but it's at least interesting.  <br /> <br />Beyond viruses, this book also goes into other forms of nasty programs like Trojan Horses, HiJackers (that replace your home page with theirs), worms, Phishing Scams, and Spyware. I'd have liked to have seen just a little more about some of these, such as an evaluation of the anti- software that is available.  <br /> <br />Like all the For Dummies books, this is a good introductory book, not the final word. But if you have a computer connected to the web, you'd best be paying at least some attention to Viruses, and this is a good start.	2004-09-17

The U.S. Constitution says: to promote the progrss of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors exclusive right to their respective writing and discoveries. From there it gets a lot messier. For instance a book copyrighted and published in 1930 was under copyright for 28 years. If the copyright was not renewed it expired in 1958. But if in 1958 the copyright was renewed for an additional 28 years, or 1986. But the law was changed so that if the copyright was not renewed the book is in the public domain. But if it was renewed the copyright now goes until 70 years after the death of the author, or maybe 95 years after it was first published, or possibly 120 years after it was created.  <br /> <br />And if you think that is a mess, wait until you get into digital, like the web. If a book is still in copyright in the US, but available on an Australian web site, can you download it, can you print a copy, can you sell it?  <br /> <br />This book clearly, and using an interesting format explains these and lots more points.	2004-09-17

Here, however, is a book not on building a house, but on building an entire neighborhood.  <br /> <br />It starts with a bit of history, the pattern books written in roman times. It brings them up to date with a survey of several American neighborhoods dating from turn of the century times. And finally it goes on to show what the authors have done as they designed blocks, sub-divisions and the like. It is intended to show what can be done to replace the common cookie cutter houses common in recent developments. It is a fascinating book that leads to thinking.	2004-09-17

While this is a For Dummies book, and doesn't go down really into the Power Programming (that's another of his books) level, they couldn't have gotten a more knowledgeable person to write it. You can take what he says in the book (or on the books companion web site just in case a typo made it through the editing system) as something handed down on stone tablets.<br /><br />Second, he really knows how to convey the information he has. I find his writing style to be well laid out, informative, almost a pleasure to read (true pleasure I associate with good Science Fiction, not any computer book).<br /><br />Third, he really seems to be a nice guy. While I've never met him, the home page on his web site (given at the very beginning of the book) has a has a link - Send e-mail to John Walkenbach. On a couple of occassions, I've had a reason to send him an e-mail asking a question. He's answered promptly, curteously and save me a whole bunch of time.<br /><br />If you want a quick and rapid introduction to macros or VBA programming (in Excel these are the same thing), something that will get you started, this is an excellent choice. As you become a power user, buy his Power Programming with VBA book, and indeed his other Excel books.	2004-09-17

Yardley was, as they say, accustomed to luxury, and when fired in 1929 wrote this book on the breaking of foreign codes by the United States. (His firing is another story, when Hoover's secretary of state refused to continue the funding of the Black Chamber with the comment, Gentlemen do not read other people's mail.) Yardley had found a loophole in the law so that he couldn't be prosecuted, but boy did it annoy the Government. The book was a best seller, and started him or a career as an author. He wrote another four or five books on codes and another best seller called The Education of a Poker Player.  <br /> <br />The book is fascinating, well written and filled with stories of stealing code books, beautiful female spies. And better descriptions of how to break codes that I've seen in any of the other books on the history of code breaking (maybe because the codes in the 1920's were simpler minded than later Enigma machines).  <br /> <br />This book ties in very well with the new book The Reader of Gentlemens Mail.	2004-09-17

The park has two parts, the valley floor and the fifty or so mile road through the high country.  <br /> <br />Most people (I've read 95%) never leave the valley. The valley is indeed beautiful - wild animals, water falls, and more. But the high country is really special. &#60;BR&#62;&#60;BR&#62;Half dome for instance is a giant smooth rounded pebble that from one side looks like something that you'd find in a creek bed, except that it's giant size. But then it's cut in two, with the cut away half simply gone. The result is one of the most spectacular mountains in the world.  <br /> <br />Here in this book, is Yosemite. It's pictured from a rock climbers standpoint. And from that standpoint it shows places that I don't want to even think about going. But the views you get. You simply can't imagine. The photographer is a world class climber in his own right. Then he combines this with a camera that he obviously knows how to use.  <br /> <br />There are a lot of things here (nearly every picture in fact) that I'm not going to see in real life. I'm glad that this book exists.	2004-09-17

To my surprise, the Brooks have found all of these hikes within a reasonable distance from the city. As a for instance, the Pelham Bay Park is 2,766 acres in size with 13 miles of shoreline. It's also reachable by public transport. (Take the #6 train followed by the Bx29 bus.) The hiking there is flat, shoreline and all that. Or there's Norvin Green where you'll need sturdy hiking shoes, and find multiple deep-water streams to cross in a 9.3 mile up and down trail. Other hikes include wildlife refuges, state forests, national recreation areas, swamps, mountains, rivers, waterfalls, ocean shores. You can get away from the concrete.  <br /> <br />As a book, the layout makes it easy to find things. The overall maps lead you to the general area you may find interesting. The descriptions of each of the 60 hikes includes a description, a detailed map of each, elevation profile, and directions - usually by automobile and public transport. As the back cover says, If you live near NYC, get it.	2004-09-16

Nominally the book is about computer identification technologies. That is, everything from bar codes to credit cards with their black stripe on the back to the little gadgets that you put in your car to go through the automatic readers on the toll roads. In their descriptions of this technology both as it presently exists and as it will exist in the next few years the authors are right on. They know whereof they speak and they have done a good job of even projecting the trends.  <br /> <br />The other part of the book is on the social aspects of what such technologies might mean to our freedoms in the future. Here I'm not so sure I agree. In their discussion on passports, they talk about the use of passports to control travel into and out of a country. OK, but they didn't do much good at keeping the 9/11 terriorists out. Money has been something that was going to be tracked completely, totally and utterly. But there is more cash money floating around today than at any time in the past. The drug trade doesn't take credit cards, and drugs are a huge business all around the world. I'm reminded of a comment made some time ago about surveillance: Yes, there's a camera watching everywhere, but most of them are broken and the operator is asleep.  <br /> <br />Could big brother be watching? You'll have to read the book to see if you agree.	2004-09-16

In England, the thatch roofed masony building comes to mind. In France the house isbuilt around the kitchen and garden. In America there was a different climate, different building materials, different needs.  <br /> <br />This book looks at old houses that have been remodeled, and new designs that were based on the traditional look of American farm houses of New England and the mid-west. Most interesting is the architectural blending of additions to the old houses. Some of them are made to blend in as though they were part of the original design. Some of them are made so obviously different - steel and glass addition on a 1799 vintage wooden square box house.  <br /> <br />In this day of mass produced sub-divisions with cookie cutter houses, it is great to see that the design of interesting, beautiful and utilitarian houses has not completely gone away.	2004-09-14

In this book the authors discuss a systems analysis aproach to instruction that treats instruction not as an end in itself, but as a process that is trying to reach a defined goal. It doesn't matter what the goal is, but the establishment of a goal is the first step. Then following their model, their set of procedures to measure the attainment of that goal you can adjust or modify the goals or procedures to achieve the best results.  <br /> <br />The model they have developed is simple to follow and has been evolving over several editions of this book. The latest edition, the sixth, incorporates all of the changes brought about through feedback from using the system.	2004-09-13

Things like how and why it came about, what it is supposed to be doing. A lot of books start out with something like: To Install GNOME.... This one starts out: GNOME is.... And it gives you a web site where you can go get the latest version. Sure GNOME is on the CD included with the book, but versions change frequently in the open source community and if what's on the CD does happen to be the latest version, it won't be for long.  <br /> <br />The other good point about this book is that it is a complete reference. In one book it covers the whole system. This means that it cannot go into as much depth as a dedicated book, but here is at least a start on everything that you're likely to need to know. And if it isn't here, there are references as to where to go get things.	2004-09-13

I've tried to use the internet as it was intended, a free and open system where I could surf, send e-mails to friends and business associates, and generally tried to be a good internet citizen. Why is it then that about 60% of the e-mail I receive is trying to sell me investments, medicine, a phony degree, or enlargement of certain body parts, some of which I don't even have.  <br /> <br />The answer, of course, is that it's free to send out e-mails in any quantity to any list of addresses. What I don't understand is why the congress has allowed it to continue, but they do.  <br /> <br />The answer is that you have to be prepared to defend yourself from these unwanted intrusions. I thought I was doing pretty well, until a particularly nasty adware program managed to get into and install itself in my system. One of the packages included on the CD in this book solved the problem, that alone made the book worth its price.	2004-09-13

Few mysteries that I've read have been able to keep up with the changes going on in the world. With peace broken out between the U.S.S.R. and the rest of the world, you cannot use the KGB as the enemy any more. Here is a mystery, set in the United States but with the main character an illegal alien. Bewildered by the culture, a language he cannot speak, a world willing to take advantage of him and to use him for their own purposes.  <br /> <br />And life is going at least OK when the F.B.I. starts to get involved with suspicions of terrorism both his and our assumptions about what is going on suddenly get much more complex. This is especially true as we realize that this is the time leading up to the 9/11 attacks. I find myself wondering just how Ms. Adams was able to develop such an interesting and complete character from a culture (Algerian) so different than ours. I think we have a new major player in the fiction scene.	2004-09-13

While still a teenager, he and his family who were living in Seattle were given 48 hours to sell their home and business and were moved into a cencentration camp. He lived in the camp until he was 18, at which time he was drafted into the Army. They took one look at him in the Army and said, You're going to be a Japanese interpreter. His reply, Man, I'm third generation American, I don't speak a word of Japanese. His brother enlisted in the Army to get out of the camp and was a member of the famous 442 Regimental Combat Team fighting in Italy where he was severly wounded.  <br /> <br />This was one of the more disgraceful acts of our Government. There was not any movement to move Americans of German or Italian descent into camps. The Japanese Americans on Hawaii were not affected, only those on the west coast of the mainland. And there was never a case of spying by the Japanese Americans.  <br /> <br />This splendid book brings a new level of research and understanding to thie shameful time in our history.	2004-09-13

Sure there are biographers, mystery writers, text book writers and all the others. And come to think of it, when I wanted to go somewhere on vacation I would sometimes go down to the book store and pick up something about the place I was visiting. I guess that I never though about how these books got written.  <br /> <br />Michael shapiro has changed my view. In this book he reports on visiting eighteen travel writers and getting them to talk about their lives, their profession, and their industry. These authors lead a different kind of life. I've travelled a lot on business, and the travel part of it is an unavoidable evil, cramped airplane seats, a never ending string of airports that all look much the same, an uncertainty as to the hotel, the money, the culture. For these writers, the travel is the end in itself. Well, almost. You still have to do the writing after you've done the travel. After reading this book, I'll never look at travel the same way. The people Mr. Shapiro interviews are a delightful and eclectic group, and very fascinating.	2004-09-13

Set in the background of the First World War, it describes life in a small settlement where life has been going on pretty much as it always has for centuries. Here life has intertwined Christian and Muslim traditions with little friction, indeed with humor. But the world intrudes.  <br /> <br />The invasion at Gallipoli and the rise of fanatical religion and nationalism destroy the fabric of centuries-old peace. Parallel with the story of the small town is the story of Kemal Ataturk, the defending general at Gallipoli who is now considered the founder of the Turkish Republic and its first president.  <br /> <br />Well researched, this book presents the history of the time and place in a way that is delightful to read and educational.	2004-09-13

It may be commercial store fronts, rental homes, or ranches, but these people are not living in rented apartments. They may own the apartment house, but they are not a renter.  <br /> <br />The authors key point is: Don't wait to buy real estate, buy real estate and wait. To expand on this he explains the legal aspects (Our Government basically wants you to buy Real Estate), how to find the seller who is eager to part with solid buildings in prime locations, the impact of the current low interest rates, and much more.  <br /> <br />This book is the revised and up to date version of Mr. Allen's book Nothing Down which was first published in 1980.	2004-09-13

Each of them spends more time bashing the other than they do explaining what they stand for themselves. I, and others lament the way it seems that electioneering has turned so sour. We also remember the Florida debacle of the last election.  <br /> <br />Now this book comes along and I find that in the election of 1800 Adams called Jefferson a howling atheist. That the election was so close that the stalemate in the Electoral College dragged on for days, and that finally a secret deal changed a single vote to give Jefferson the White House. I guess that elections really haven't changed that much after all.  <br /> <br />John Feerling is a very good author, and the book reads almost like a novel, fast paced, moving and you wonder just how a lot of the small points are going to turn out.	2004-09-10

Oh sure, you had a wireless remote for the TV, but that was about it. Then wireless LANs came about. Most of the users I know use them around the house. You can plug a card into your laptop and work anywhere in the house from the hammock out back to the TV room. And of course you can take your laptop to Starbucks or McDonalds and check your e-mail. And with new cell phone/PDA's you can work on a world wide basis.  <br /> <br />This is a new book, completely up to date that is an introduction to wireless communications. It covers all aspects of communicating data over the airways and gives you enough information to be able to go buy the equipment you need for whatever task you need to perform. It is not a super-geek type book that goes into how the radio signals operate, but it is enough to get you started.	2004-09-10

No, it has nothing to do with cloth or wall paper. It's about software programming. Perhaps someone told you about this book and you're wondering what it is all about.  <br /> <br />Refactoring, simply put is re-writing code to make it simpler, easier to understand without changing what the code does.  <br /> <br />Patterns are simply common solutions to recurring problems faced by programmers.  <br /> <br />This book is not intended to be your first programming book. But if you are working as a professional programmer, this book can help you write better, tighter, faster, easier to modify code. The title is the most imposing, even frightening part of the book. Inside it is clearly written and provides a lot of hints, tips and suggestions that are worth quite a lot.	2004-09-10

This is a book on the development environment itself, not on the applications that you may be developing. While you could, of course, use a simple text editor to write code, using a development environment will assist by providing tools to make the code better, faster to write, and most important much more bug free.  <br /> <br />The database integration is the specific area in which JDeveloper is separated from other Java development tools. JDeveloper provides for database connectivity in a way that greatly simplifies the development of a business application getting data into or out of a database. Since it was written by Oracle, it obviously concentrates on using Oracle. If your company is an Oracle user, this approach is highly recommended.	2004-09-10

The 'documetary' Fahrenheit 9/11 has picked up on every rumor and allegation that it seems any conspiracy buff can create and states them as fact. It was refreshing to see a book praising George w. Bush. <br /> <br />Although the title would make you believe that this book is purely about the religious or spiritual aspects of Bush's life, in reading it I was surprised to find the amount of insider information that Paul Kengor had about the thinking process of the President as he decided to run for various offices and on issues such as the war in Iraq. This book, very slightly re-written and re-titled could be a, Inside the Bush Administrations Decision to go to War. It's only a year or two after these decisions are made that books like this one describe what really went on as opposed to the 30 second news spots and the never ending political commercials. Well worth reading as you make a decision about for whom to vote or in understanding the background of the war.	2004-09-10

They presume that you are a smart person, not afraid of computers, but that you need to learn how to use something new, like a piece of software on your computer. Further they assume that you want to get started without having to pour through all the 1500 pages or so in the guru level book. This book takes the Office 2004 software package for the Mac computer and gives it the In a Snap approach.  <br /> <br />In evaluating books on Office, I always look first to see if they discuss Pivot Tables in the section on Excel. A surprising number of books don't, or give them very short treatment. In this book the index sends you to page 263, that puts you right in the middle of a discussion on pivot tables. Flipping back a page or three gets you to a section called Find Relationships Between Data. What an excellent idea, that's what a pivot table really is, but doesn't have the problem of the dumb name Pivot Table. The discussion is as good as I've seen anywhere in explaining what you can use them for.  <br /> <br />The next thing I found was inside the front cover where they have a \\"Contents at a Glance.\\" This sends you to, not the page number - that's the function of the index, but to a section identified by its own numbering system. Really a handy way to get where you want to jump in to solve the problem you're having at the moment.	2004-09-09

The Chief Petty Officer is the backbone of the Navy. The officers provide overall direction, and the sailors make the ships go. In between is the CPO who takes the commands from the officers and converts it into something that the individual sailors can do. As such, the CPO is in a leadership position without which nothing would happen. It is no surprise then that the sections of this book deal with leadership: Leading, Communication, Developing, and Supporting.  <br /> <br />The Navy approach is different. In industry you wouldn't find foremen in a factory with a specific responsibility for developing young executives. But in the Navy the CPO had a direct responsibility for developing the junior officers who are above him. This is a low price book that I'd recommend to the recent MBA graduate, just as I would to the new CPO learning his job.	2004-09-09

The United States and the world around us is changing. For half a century the world situation was framed as part of the super-power struggle between the Soviet Union bloc and the so called Free World. Even the smaller countries, Cuba, the little African states, Israel and the Middle East had overtones of the super-power struggle.  <br /> <br />Then it all changed. And we are still formulating what we are going to do. There is a view that the country under George W. Bush is heading towards building an Empire. The United States has poweres economically, politically, and militarily. Mr. Hart argues that there is a fourth power - principle.  <br /> <br />We are heading into a strange new world. The rise of non-governmental organizations like Al Qaeda present a new kind of threat. The rise of a united Europe, bigger with more people, more money than the United States - there is no one else in the world big enough to go to war with the US. The problems of AIDS throughout Africa and explosively growing in Asia present a future bleak for most of the world.  <br /> <br />Mr. Hart suggests a strategy for the United States to follow based on building on American principles of participatory democracy. I wish I could hear more of this debate from the two people running for President rather than the opponent bashing that seems to occupy most of what I hear.	2004-09-08

Looked at in some ways, the European Community has clearly surpassed the United States. It has more people, more GNP, longer lifespans, more leisure time than does the United States. When viewed collectively this presents an apparently monolithic block that indeed rivals the US. And it is further clear that Europe and the United States are growing further apart. It seems that there is no longer the cold war to hold us together.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, Europe has a long and bloody history of internal conflict. Can you imagine perennial enemies like Germany and France, or Greece and Turkey remaining friends forever? And I'm reminded of other writers such as Lou Dobbs new book that laments and critizes the formation of a bigger trading grouping in North America, i.e. NAFTA.  <br /> <br />An interesting book with some very good points, well worth reading, but we'll all have to wait and see what happens.	2004-09-08

In this case he has taken an old book by James H. Schmitz that dates from 1966. Compared to modern science fiction such a book would have been very dated, and while the basic story line might have been good, it just wouldn't have been a very good read.  <br /> <br />Baen then brought in Eric Flint, one of the better writters in his stable (in my humble opinion of course). He is credited as an Editor, but he might have been better called an up-to-dater. He up-to-dated the book so that it reads like a new story, but keeps the theme, feel, and attitude of the original.  <br /> <br />The next thing that they did, was produce this volume in hard cover for a retail price of $16, that's just about half of what hardbacks normally cost. Way to go Mr. Baen.  <br /> <br />Oh yes, the story. Space opera at its finest. Capt. Pausert of the tramp space ship Venture frees three slave children. Well, they turn out to be witches ....  <br /> <br />Did I mention that Baen also seems to mix comedy with his space opera, and that he also gives you the first four chapters of the book at his web site.	2004-09-08

Anyone would be hard pressed to find better writers than the ones chosen for this task. And a fine job they have done indeed. The characters are continued, and so is the feeling or tone you get in reading the book. Serious heavy duty reading, no. But it's one of those books that after you buy it you have to ask yourself, \\"Do I really want to stay awake most of the night reading this, or should I save it for a rainy day.\\"  <br /> <br />The story - space opera at its finest: valiant but kind of bumbling hero, strange characters in unlikely situations -- well you know.

He has written this book to explain his point of view.  <br /> <br />More important, he looks at the reasons, Corporate Greed is his major finding, but also the relationship between business and Government. He mentions, but I would like to see a lot more on the subject, the short term view of businessmen in the U.S. This comes from the SEC requirements of quarterly reports and a stock market that promptly punishes failure of a company not increasing sales/profits/etc. each quarter.  <br /> <br />Mr. Dobbs clearly expresses a point of view from the left wing of the political spectrum. A good bit of discussion in on the \\"right\\" of a person to have a job. This is clearly not one expressed in the original Bill of Rights.  <br /> <br />His answer seems to be for Government to change their approach to the problem. It's really simpler than that. All Americans would have to do is stop buying from cars to electric fans that were not manufactured in America - but they would have to pay more.	2004-09-07

I first saw this movie advertised in a theater poster of coming attractions ten or so years ago. I was immediately ready to go see it, but it never came to the theater. I looked for it for years, and finally was able to get a copy.    It isn't the best of the series, the sequels never are (Star Wars comes to mind.). But I had to see it. I'm sure glad that I was finally able to get a copy.    I laughed a lot, but I must admit that some of this was at how bad it was. The friends you show it to need to be die hard Gods Must be Crazy fans.    There's another, hard to find, Gods Must Be Crazy movie at Amazon, but it's listed as Crazy Hong Kon (with the g left off of Kong) so it doesn't come up when you search for Gods Must Be Crazy. It's the best of the later movies. You might also want to check out the Gods Must Be Crazy website.	2004-09-05

And if you did, it isn't ckear that you'd know just what questions to ask. Clara Hemphill does know. As the director of Insideschools.org she has spent years analyzing the public school system in NYC. She looks at the schools academically (of course) but also in other aspects such as friendliness, willingness of the teaching staff to work with the kids individually, social development and many more.  <br /> <br />Note the title, this book discusses the BEST schools. And New York's best are very good indeed. These are not the warehouses where the kids are just putting in time. These are the places you would want your kid to go.	2004-09-05

It seems like they skip the first twenty or fifty pages that should describe just what it is that you're trying to do here.  <br /> <br />This book is different. It starts out with let's build these two web pages. First you create a folder, then you type in a few characters into what you'll save as a file. You know, that headline would look a lot more like a headline if it were bigger, here's how you do a heading.  <br /> <br />No, it's not going to teach you everything about HTML.

Ours certainly does a bunch of stupid stuff. But then you look at what others do and have to agree with Churchill that a democracy is the worst form of government except that all the other forms are worse.<br /><br />In this book on the last 600 days of Mussolini, you get a very clear illustration of this point. In his last days, Mussolini was a tyrant, yet at the same time he was utterly miserable in the grip of anger, shame and depression. The German forces that had been supporting were being driven from Italy by the Americans and British.<br /><br />Mussolini had had the power, as it was said, \\"he made the trains run on time.\\" But in the end he had failed, and he knew he had failed. He had tried to run a country. And he made some tragic errors. We have so many books on Hitler, it is nice to see that finally we are beginning to see what happened in another aspect of WWII.<br /><br />I was also amused to see the points of controversy that remain sixty years later. I guess that like the killing of Lincoln and Kennery, and events like Pearl Harbour and the World Trade Center, mysteries will always remain.	2004-09-03

Since peace has broken out and there's no more big bad KGB, the spy thriller has hard time. Some writers have simply gone back to before peace and continued as was. Some writers have taken the point of using older spy's and giving them one last mission before their retirement. But what do you do when you're just barely out of training for the spy business, you're still in your mid-twenties like Charlie Millar.  <br /> <br />The story -- well it's a spy story about espionage and stuff like that which gets all screwed up. The Good News - it's a delightful read. The Bad News - this is a new book, so it will be quite a while until we see another from the author.	2004-09-03

I live in one of the \\"battleground states\\" for the next Presidental election. You can't watch an hour on TV without seeing the conflicting claims of both candidates about a half dozen times. You soon reach a point of tuning them both out. Each is, shall we say, emphasising their own point of view, if not outright ... no I'm not going to use that word, they wouldn't do that.  <br /> <br />And the news isn't much better, I'm continually reminded of the old saying, \\"if it bleeds it leads.\\" The stories are on the latest bomb, the latest shoot out. Only when the books are written do you begin to get a more balanced, more completely thought out view. The authors conclusion is that ordinary Iraquis back our war and occupation and the U.S. is on the verge of winning a tough guerilla struggle. I certainly hope he's right. Well worth reading to help sort out the BS on TV.	2004-09-03

This is the third edition of this book, and like Microsoft's software, with the third release it's finally come together pretty well. It starts off with a pretty good introduction. I like that. So many computer books seem to leave out the first twenty pages that should describe just what it is that we're trying to do here.  <br /> <br />After it says what we're trying to do, then it talks about where Open GL came from, why it came at all and where it's going. It starts simple with a program that's only about six lines of code. From there it gets as complex as you want to go.  <br /> <br />Covers of computer books often say something like \\"For Beginning to Intermediate Users.\\" It's rare that I find that this is true. Usually the books are too short to start out simple enough and then take it far enough to truly cover the intermediate lefe.  This one does.	2004-09-03

It's hard to realize that the web is only about a dozen years old. Being so new, it is not surprising that dramatic, big jumps in the technology are taking place. At first the web was just static pages connected by hyperlinks. This evolved into dynamic pages where the data is in a database and displayed at will. But this is still presented to the user as a fixed page of data. This page you are reading came out of a database, but it's just a page, you can't do very much with it. All in all, it's kind of silly to use a powerful computer, like the one you probably have, just to display a page.  <br /> <br />If you just want a small amount of data off the page, how do you get it. What if you just want to know how many pages are in a book. You have to download the whole page and practically speaking you have to read the material presented to find the number of pages. If you really want that number in a spreadsheet you are using, for all practical purcposes have to type it in or perhaps do a cut and paste. To do this automatically you're into some rather sophisticated programming. Making this work is the semantic web.  <br /> <br />This book is a primer and overview of the current state of the art.	2004-09-02

After Effects is a leading motion graphics and visual effects software system. A lot of the dynamic animation you see moving titles around on TV show ads are done using After Effects. And a lot of these come from CyberMotion, the authors company.  <br /> <br />That I think is the key to this book. It isn't a manual on how to use the software. It is a book on this is what I needed to do and this is how I did it. The voice of experience comes through. It's clear that the authors know whereof they speak. I found the little points where they illustrate 'this is what happens if you do this wrong.' It's a lot easier to learn what not to do here in a book before doing it and then trying to find out what you did wrong later.  Highly recommended.	2004-09-02

It is an introductory level book. That is to say, it will get you started, but by the time you have a working site, you will have learned a lot more than in your specialized areas than is covered here. This book provides the basic introduction. Do you want a shopping cart type application or perhaps an auction? What about peer-to-peer file sharing or perhaps a blog? This book will talk about these initial decisions that have to be made before you start thinking about the guts of implementing them. After these decisions are made you'll need more detailed books on the specific area where you are going.  <br /> <br />The one thing I would like to see added to a new edition would be specific software recommendations, i.e. what two or three shopping cart solutions would she recommend.	2004-09-02

It is the logical aftermath of Samuel Huntington's Foreign Affairs article The Clash of Civilizations but brought up to date and far more interresting reading.  <br /> <br />A young man is riding on a bus. He sets off a bomb that he is wearing under his clothing - what religion is he? Another young man takes a sniper rifle and blows away the doctor at an abortion clinic - fundamentalist Christian would you say? Another Arab settlement on the West Bank is bulldozed flat - well you get the idea.  <br /> <br />As Huntington predicted, we are in an era where faith inspires conflict. It's not the first time. In 846 the Muslim's sacked Rome. A couple of hundred years was the first crusade. During WWII the Christian Germans killed six million Jews in the Holocaust. Another five million were Gypsies, blacks, homosexuals, Jehovah Witnesses; but that's another story.  <br /> <br />Harris' basic tenent is that a bunch of books, written by God, but mutually exclusive even to recommending that you kill the believers in all the other books is not a safe way to run a world. He eloquently calls on us to take a secular, humanistic approach to solving the problems of this world. It's an approach almost guaranteed to offend everyone.  <br /> <br />Even if you decide not to read the book, go to the authors web site, [...] and at least read the Q&A.	2004-09-02

Would you believe that there's a class in interviewing people at UCLA? Well there is, and it's tought by Lawrence Grobel. What I found astounding was the amount of preparation that he goes through before interviewing someone.  <br /> <br />After having it explained, it all makes sense. If you're going through the effort to travel to Tahiti to spend a week interviewing Marlon Brando, you're not going to get another chance to follow up with more questions later. But for the interview with Drew Barrymore he prepared 158 questions, that's right one hundred and fifty eight.  <br /> <br />I don't plan to go interview movie stars, but I've had job interviews, and the preparation he does in advance makes it clear that these techniques will work in both directions. The person interviewing you will turn out to be interview by you instead and can't help but be impressed with your preparation and understanding.	2004-09-02

The traditional British who-done-it is still alive. It's complete with totally unexpected events (He got done in with his own authentic torture device.), amazing characters, and above all the quaint British tiny, tiny little towns. I don't suppose you'd be reading this if you weren't familiar with Caroline Graham's Chief Inspector Barnaby Mysteries. But if you are a fan of them like so many others, they you won't be dissappointed. It's easy to see why the Sunday Times of London called her, \\"Simply the best detective writer since Agatha Christe.\\"  <br /> <br />The story, you know it already: a gruesome murder, a wild set of characters done with depth and humor, the Chief Inspector and his trusty sidekick chasing down conflicting leads. The real question: Winter's coming, and the snow, the fireplace is ready. Do you wait to snuggle down with a book you know will be good, or do you gobble it down immediately.	2004-09-02

The Enneagram is not unlike other personality oriented systems. First an individual is asked to examine nine different personality types and to identify himself with one. Then the Enneagram, a diagram of the interaction of the various types can be used to predict behavior.  <br /> <br />The book, however, reverses the normal trend in personality testing books where the book is organized around the personality type. Instead the book describes several common business situations and then describes how the various personality types react to the situation.	2004-09-01

There was a whole chapter. And this is an area most Excel books either ignore or gloss over lightly. And if you really want a thrill, go look at the Microsoft documentation on them. In about 40 pages, this chapter answered everything I needed to know to get over the emergency of the moment. I guess I gave out with the appropriate Aaaah's. I was really left with just one question. Why do they call them Pivot Tables, what a meaningless name.  <br /> <br />After this, I sat down to read the book. I found that I skimmed over a lot. Some of it I knew, some of it I didn't care about, some of it I filed away to remember when I needed to do something different.

We think of terrorist attacks as something that should be the responsibility of governments. But as this book points out, most of the targets are not government buildings or institutions, they are businesses. Targets have certainly included aircraft and also banks, theaters, churches, buses, trains, pipe lines, gas stations, restaurants, department stores, hospitals churches and of course office building such as those at the World Trade Center.  <br /> <br />Security tends to follow the last successful attack. After 9/11 a tremendous amount of effort was spent on air line scurity, almost nothing on subways, bridges, tunnels - can you imagine the effect of blowing up a few of these in New York City?  <br /> <br />This is not a prescription of what to do to avoid or stop terrorist activity, as the title suggests, it is an introduction to the risks involved and an explanation of what is happening on a world wide basis as a result. A small book, it covers these aspects very well.	2004-08-31

But if you are, then listening to what Vince Dooley has to say, and the reminisces of the players from the last 40 years or so makes for fascinating reading.  <br /> <br />The book is part autobiography of Dooley, and then commentary from a couple of dozen players, most of whom went on to good success in whatever they did: some in football, a judge, businessmen of all types, but all see their start on the football field.

No one knows what caused the evolutionary giant leap from the apes to humans. There have been all kinds of theories from the opposable thumb to walking upright. In this book two eminent psychologists propose a theory that symbols, particularly language tought from one generation to the next drove the development of intelligence. As such, they come down firmly on the nurture rather than nature side of the argument. From watching children, they are both specialists in child development, they persuasively argue that children are taught symbolic thinking. From here they use evidence from the fossil record and neuroscience to develop their theory. Fascinating reading.	2004-08-31

By 1941 38 men remained in Company A, 116th Infantry, 29th Infantry Division.  <br /> <br />At 6:30 am on June 6th 1944, Company A landed on Dog Green, the western most section of Omaha Beach. Ten minutes later nineteen boys from Bedford, Virginia were dead.  <br /> <br />This is the highest percentage of casualties experienced by any town since the Civil War, and is the reason that the National D-Day Memorial is located in Bedford.  <br /> <br />This book is not a unit narrative, true it tells what Company A did, but its real point is what happened in the town and to its people.

Bill Hybels, the senior pastor of Willow Creek Community Church says that basically people want to volunteer. They want to find something in their lives that takes them beyond their daily job. It could be that they spend 8 hours a day operating a drill press or selling insurance, or designing a new bridge. But often, even usually this doesn't provide the fullfillment that they need in life.  <br /> <br />Getting such people to volunteer by straping on a tool kit and helping to repair an inter city house, by asking them to help in a soup kitchen, or just ring the bell for the Salvation Army helps the church, the community and especially the individual volunteer. <br /> <br />More than just an appeal for service, this is a how-to manual on how to attract, motivate, and keep volunteers working.

Scott Kelby, the editor in chief of Photoshop User magazine talks about not how to use Photoshop, but a series of maybe two hundred little hints and tips that show not only how to do something but clearly illustrates the effect being created using actual screen shots.  <br /> <br />These are not the super sophisticated complicated and rarely used procedures. These are the techinques that real everyday users have developed to get their jobs done on a day to day basis. It combines in one volume a whole bunch of \\"Of course, why didn't I think of that,\\" ideas.  <br /> <br />What I find in this book is new ideas of ways to convey the message I'm trying to send. Just one or two such ideas makes the cost and the time spent on the book worthwhile.	2004-08-26

I've read a lot about how Alexander's Tactics led to victories in some of the most famous battles in history. But until this book I had never thought of the organizational problems he had to face.  <br /> <br />The military history books say, Alexander had 40,000 troops. But, how did he feed them, what did he do with wounded. This book is written from the standpoint of relating Alexander's actions to the modern business world, comparing the situations to Apple Computer, General Motors, Ben & Jerry's and other organizations. I'm not so sure however, that it shouldn't be on your military history bookshelf.	2004-08-26

During the year and almost a half since Server '03 came out, Microsoft has released several Feature Packs. These have not only fixed bugs, but tightened security, and changed the way Server '03 would be implemented and supported. Each of these has been analyzed and incorporated into this new edition of this 'standard' book.  <br /> <br />The CD contained with the book includes far more than the normal code samples and other useless stuff. Here are the Feature Packs, the Server '03 Tools, Windows rights Management Services Client and Server SDKs and 14 Webcasts by the author.  <br /> <br />This is not a book that you'll want to sit down and read from front to back at one setting. It is, however, more than a reference book. the authors write with a sense that they know what they are doing. They've been there and done that. The writing style shows that they can compare what the OS does now in comparison with what it did in earlier versions. I found this to be of great help when I was trying to do something the old way and the book pointed out that this is the way its done now. The book is not a surprise, you probably know what you are getting and you won't be disappointed.	2004-08-19

I first looked at using MySql in a web application back around 2001 or 2. Using it would have required a port of the SQL statements. And I decided not to use it. The application I was porting had lots of statements that used SubQueries, and MySql didn't support these. Yes, I could have re-written all the statements using joins and other methods, but what a lot of work.  <br /> <br />As a result, when I was first flipping through this book I found a section - Subquery Syntax. In that section, the first example showed a nested SELECT statement that had four cascaded subqueries. So I sat down in the bookstore and started reading this section. Subqueries took a dozen pages to describe, and included enough information that I found myself learning a lot about subqueries that I didn't know. (I'd point these things out, but then you'd just think I was pretty dumb.)  <br /> <br />Then I looked for a few other things that I've had trouble finding with other DB books: Reserved Words (go try to find the reserved words in Access for instance) they are the last couple of pages in Chapter 2. Replication - it's there. Everything I looked for was there.  <br /> <br />Let's net this out. This book is $40 (that's list price, but you know better than that). The software is ZIP - just go to [...] click on developer and download the version you want (Linux in a bunch of versions, Windows, and several versions of Unix). The price is still ZIP. You want to upgrade to the next version, yup, cost is ZIP. Less than $40 is your total investment.	2004-08-19

Everything was going to be processed like magic and only the conclusions needed to be reviewed.  <br /> <br />OK, so all of your data is in a database and it's your job to do INFORMATION DELIVERY and to create BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE. How do you take all that data and present it in a manner that is timely enought and easily understood enough for management to understand and make decisions. Of course you could use the standard reports that come with the software package you're using. But they are not what management wants. Of course you could write SQL statements to get at the data, and then program what's printed or displayed. But what a pain.  <br /> <br />Enter Crystal Reports with its drag and drop philosophy of building the reports to provide the information you need. The book is broken into two main parts. The first half or so is oriented to content creation, how to collect an analyze the information you have available. The second is on distribution of this data through all the means available today from the printed page, the web, and the new .NET /COM channel.	2004-08-19

In 1972 the first edition of the 'Limits To Growth' was published. It said simply that there were limits to what the planet Earth could support. It made complete total and utter sense. After all, if the population kept growing forever then at some time all the molecules in the earth would be used up in flesh rather than rocks, air, water, etc. Obviously this isn't going to happen.  <br /> <br />There's a limit to the amount of oil we can get out of the ground. And a large part of what remains is in the Middle East. No one in Government, either Republican or Democrat will say that we are in Iraq because that's where the oil is. Nor will they say we need to increase the fuel economy of our vehicles. The Republicans listen to the auto manufacturers management, the Democrats listen to the auto union members.  <br /> <br />This single book covers every aspect of what's happening in the world. There are others on alternative energy, acid rain, the decline in fish production, everything. Here in one book is the overall summary. It covers every aspect. I'd say that it should be required reading in every high school, in every college. But of course it isn't.	2004-08-16

This book is a semi-autobiographical in that the first part of the book covers his early days working to protect Egypt's past. It then goes on as though giving us a personally conducted tour of some of the most important excavation sites in Egypt. It is absolutely filled with information that would never have occurrec to the casual observer. For instance, the average tourist leaves about an ounce of moisture from breath and sweat in the interior chambers of the Giza pyramids. The aftereffects of this cause a deteriation of the chamber.  <br /> <br />The book is profusely illustrated, with 251 of the 262 photographs printed in color.	2004-08-16

This book presumes a basic level of familiarity with the Macintosh operating system, and then goes on to provide in-depth technical information and procedures that are used by Apple-certified technicians to install, configure, maintain, and diagnose Macintosh computers.  <br /> <br />It is oriented, as you might expect, to teach help-desk personnel to knowledgeably address customer concerns and questions. Each chapter is presented as a self contained lession, complete with an introduction, summary and a review quiz. The book is arranged as a help desk professional would appreciate.  It covers those areas that he is likely to be asked about, not an attempt to give an in depth lession in the OS.	2004-08-16

If there is anything you want to know about using the wind for power you will find it within the almost 500 pages of this book. From the history of using wind mills to pump water to the latest giant sized multi megawatt units, it's here. Want to know about the laws of connecting your wind generating unit to the commercial grid, it's here. Want to know the wind generation potential in the island nation of Vanuatu in the South Pacific or in your own state, it's here (along with URL's to tell you where to get more detailed information. Want a list of magazines, books, manufacturers, or software to help you site the tower, yup, it's here.  <br /> <br />Wind power generation has grown significantly since the price of oil has gone up and the extra added costs of polution have become apparent. In the last two decades, wind power system designs have been developed, matured and become a lot more practical than they were only a few years ago. This book is actually the most recent generation of Paul Gipe's books. It's the most complete, the most thoroughly developed of anything on the subject.	2004-08-15

In the next years as the full implications of the theory came to be understood, new theories began to be developed, new experiments began to extend the boundries of physics.  <br /> <br />Beginning in about 1920, these new boundries began to explore the nature of light. This eventually led to Quantum mechanics. A key to Quantum theory was that you could examing a lot of something, like a lot of atoms emitting light and statistically predict that so many atoms would emit light, but you can't say for certain just which atom would do so. Niels Bohr was a champion of the Quantum approach.  <br /> <br />Einstein rejected this statistical approach with the famous statement, \\"God does not play dice with the Universe.\\"  <br /> <br />But that is exactly what God does. This well researched book is the story of the development of Quantum mechanics and the arguments between Einstein and Bohr. One fascinating aspect is that as Bohr (and others) developed the theory, Einstein would find holes in their thinking. This forced them to work ever harder to perfect the theory. The result was a consistent, well developed theory available much sooner than it would have been othwise.  <br /> <br />There are other books that discuss this time and transition, including Andrew Whitaker's excellent 'Einstein, Bohr and the Quantum Dilemma.'But you'd better know a good bit about physics before starting it. This book, instead is written for the interested layman, and isn't so technical that you can't follow it. Highly recommended.	2004-08-14

Things moved slowly, the proton during the teens's. The newtron and several other particles in the 1930's. And that's basically where physics was when I got my physics degree more years ago than I like to remember.  <br /> <br />Then beginning in the late 1960's the world of particle physics exploded. There are more than three dozen known particles. New theories about the formation of the universe have come about. What happened at the big bang, what particles existed in the first few nanoseconds?  The development of testing machines undreamed of not so many years ago have begun to answer some of these questions.  <br /> <br />The title of this book is well chosen. It has been an odyssey. To the outsider, not working in particle physics, it has been mysterious. Newly discovered particles with names like quark, newly discovered attributes like charm, color, and strange have made it impossible to keep abreast of the developments.  <br /> <br />Here in one easy to read, beautifully illustrated and rather short book is the whole story laid out in a way that conveys just what you want to know.	2004-08-13

But it does continue the 'philosophy' of culture shock that began with the original. It's a mixed blessing. The antics are just as crazy. The Chinese Monk plays it very straight faced and is a delight to watch.  <br /> <br />The bits about the Chiness Hopping Vampire, well, when you tell someone about the movie you start off with: 'How much do you know about Chinese Hopping Vampires.' <br /> <br />The next movie in the series, Crazy Hong Kong is available on Amazon, but you have to search for Crazy Hong Kon as the name is mispelled and searching for Crazy Hong Kong won't find it. It's probably the best of the post-African movies. <br /> <br />Why five stars for such a movie. I looked for this movie for years and then laughed my head off.	2004-08-12

And the flow of democracy waxes and wanes. At times the government attempts to take more control, at other times it de-regulates. At times, like during the civil rights era it creates more freedoms, at other times (the Patriots Act comes to mind) it takes freedoms away under the guise of more security.  <br /> <br />This book presents a most interesting analysis of the governments of the world. He talks a lot about the United States. He points out that the most respected organizations within the US Government are those that are not elected: Supreme Court, Armed Forces, Federal Reserve. The liberalization of democracy in the US, brought about by the post-Watergate reforms has brought us more special interests, more well-organized minorities, and more influence of money.  <br /> <br />Dr. Zakaria's discussions of the European Union assuming power over the elected governments of Europe are excellent. The heavily socialized governments of Europe were failing, the EU has put in reforms of the monetary system, the trade regulations, and more. Changes that the politicians of the individual countries knew were important but couldn't put into effect themselves. It will be interesting to see how his ideas reflect in the changing of America.	2004-07-28

A delightful tale of four women, united by a knitting class where the first beginning project is to knit a baby blanket. That's it, a simple project.  <br /> <br />But it becomes far more than that. Debbie Macomber uses this simple task as a window into into the lives of four women in the class. She uses this setting to explore relevant women's issues with unexpected insight and sentiment along with being a delightful yarn (sorry about that, but I had to).  <br /> <br />Debbie Macomber is a knitter. She gets together with friends to sit and chat while working on projects. This is a very female form of bonding, perhaps the female equivalent of the guys going hunting. It's strange how we always seem to be going back to our cave man roots.  <br /> <br />Her characters are diverse, united only by the baby blanket. Her characterizations are real, based on real people, with real lives, real families, real problems.  <br /> <br />If you're a Debbie Macomber fan, you will not be dissappointed. If you're not, this is a good place to start.	2004-07-27

The special features tied to Java include: a compiler, debugger, text editor, GUI builder and other components. They are, as the word implies integrated into a single package. Eclipse has an overall appearance like most of the other IDE's that are oriented around their own particular task. Here in a single book is how to get Eclipse, and then how to use it to its greatest advantage. Any IDE has its own little special points, and each of these are discussed here in sufficient depth to use them without going into so much detail that you can't spend the time. <br />  <br /> I note that one reviewer says that everything here is in the Eclipse documentation. Yes, it is, but the official documentation is so difficult to read that you really can't get what you need out of it.	2004-07-27

The first time I went to Scandinavia, I arrived in Helsinki late in the evening.  I went to my hotel, and in the first few minutes I understood what was so special about Scandinavian design. The otherwise ordinary hotel room stood out as one of the best I have ever seen. It was not a tremendously expensive hotel, rather middle of the road. But simple things: the door, the faucets in the bathroom, the furniture, all were so much more elegant looking than what we find in the United States.  <br /> <br />Now I'm in the process of designing a house. I went looking for a book on interior design that would reflect what I had seen there. I found several, but this one shows more elements of design that reflect what I like. Simple things, like an office table. Easy enough to find, once I knew what I was looking for. A bed: simple, elegant, and better looking than anything I've seen in other publications.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for something for yourself or if you're doing a Scandinavian home for a customer I highly recommend this book.	2004-07-26

Even newly built houses are often designed with a view towards looking like the 19th century.  <br /> <br />In this book, hundreds of color photographs illustrate the essence of the French countryside.  The book is in two parts, the first emphasizes the soft, non-contrasting colors and the natural materials and textures that are distinctly France. The second part of the book looks at the overall style. It looks at the French home, starting of course with the kitchen (this is after all France). Only then does it move on to the rest of the house, ending with the French garden. And this is France, so the garden also emphasises a place to eat and drink.  <br /> <br />This is an absolutely delightful book.	2004-07-26

(I remember Clinton holding up the Universal Health Care card, of which nothing happened.) In this book, the executive directer of the Sierra Club, Carl Pope says that Dubya is fundamentally altering the basic equation governing environmental protection in the United States. The range of changes to the environmental laws and regulations is emmense: including Clean Air Act, endangered species, selling public lands, polluting industries writing their own regulations.  <br /> <br />This book is a report on the ways the president has not exactly changed the laws, but how their enforcement has been on the side of business, and perhaps on economic growth - but this is questionable. It attempts to explain the why George W. has made the decisions he has (It comes down to protecting his electoral base), and more important, how the people appointed by Bush to critical positions within the Government have come from the industries that they now oversee.  <br /> <br />It seems that books are the environmentalists answer to the conservative dominated talk radio. Does this say that perhaps liberals are more literate?  <br /> <br />Only after books like this come out can you begin to understand what happened within a Presidency.

Instead it was the harbinger of things to come. In spite of the evidence of the American Civil War, the Franco-Prussian war and several others, the Generals hadn't learned that the new technologies had changed the face of warfare forever. <br />  <br /> In many ways, the after effects of the war are still among us. It started in the Balkans, strangely enough only a few dozen miles from where the second Peloponnesian war had started, and where the Bosnian, Serbian, etc. 'wars' were fought a few years ago. <br />  <br /> In its writing style, this book almost reads like a good novel. In the completeness of its treatment of the subject, this book is encyclopedic. Aspects of the war such as the fighting between South Africa and German South West Africa (now Namibia) are covered where even some larger multi volume histories have ignored them. This is likely to become the definitive book on the First World War.	2004-07-25

It's an attempt to bring together: Quantum theory, Doctrines, Religion - World Religions, Religion, Buddhism - General, and Cosmology. <br /> <br />It is surprising to see how close the relationship might be. Back in 1962, Murray Gell-Mann began to fit the known elemental particles into a series of eight 'families.' Gell-Mann called this beautiful symmetry the 'Eightfold Way' after the Buddha's 'Eightfold path to truth.' This correlation or merger seems to have continued.  <br /> <br />In this book, the discussions are far ranging over the nature of matter itself, the experimental evidence, and the nature of the mind and its logic. It is not intended to be a textbook on modern particle physics, but it almost is. Well worth reading. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-07-25

The United States began as a dispute over taxes. The Stamp Act, the Boston Tea Party. Taxes were levied by England and the Americans didn't want to pay them. So we had a revolution to eliminate them. Then, somewhere along the way we found that we needed taxes to support what we wanted the Federal Government to do - like fight the Civil War. <br />This began the first phase of Federal taxation which lasted until World War I. Phase 2 lasted until World War II. And the basic structure of taxes established then lasted until Reagan in 1980. We are now in a new phase with the structure getting gradually changed under George W. Bush. <br />While the news media have been spending almost all their time on things like Iraq, behind the scenes the fundamental basic taxing structure is being debated between the President and Congress. Still being called the same things, like income tax, the income tax may take on more of the attributes of a tax on consumption. Widely attacked by the Democrats, under the Bush tax program, the richest 5 percent of taxpayers account for 56 percnt of income tax collections (up from 42% in 1986). And the deficit has increased to about 4.2%, well under the almost 6% of the Reagan era. It will be very interesting to see what happens next. <br />Well written, easy to understand, this is a book that goes far beyond the 30 second sound bites so popular on today's television news to provide an explanation on how the taxing structure of the United States got where it is, and some good thoughts on where it is going.	2004-07-02

Sometimes it's a nasty note found on a windshield. Once it was a play, four pages long, except that they didn't find Page 3. Or a note, &quot;After leaving the building, please lock this door.  It will prevent unauthorized people from entering the building and defecating in the washing machines.&quot; From that you can make up any kind of story you want. <br />One time I got a letter. It was well reasoned and talked about some business related subject that I've forgotten. Only thing, it was written in crayon. After the signature was written, &quot;Please excuse the crayon, they won't let us have anything sharp.&quot;	2004-07-02

Here he writes a very interesting book on how he thinks Lincoln would have handled the situations facing George W. Bush.<br />The simularities are striking, not only a war, but deep divisions within the country on the basic conservative/liberal viewpoints.<br />During the civil war Lincoln silenced some of his enemies by simply arresting them and holding them without trial or due process. In 1866 the Supreme Court ruled this illegal. Now the US is holding some 158 accused Taliban and al Qaeda members. Just this week the Supreme Court said 'no-no.'<br />Throughout the book Mr. Cuomo uses selected quotations from Lincoln to illustrate how he thinks Lincoln would have handled the current situations. As Mr. Cuomo is an unabashed liberal, and Mr. Bush is an unabashed conservative, I wonder if Mr. Bush might have picked a different set of quotations to prove that he is handling the situation just like Lincoln would have done. <br />This is a very different approach to using history to illustrate our current problems. One small section of the book is devoted to how Lincoln might have addressed Congress, a Lincoln's State of the Union Message if you will. Mr. Cuomo uses this 'speach' to decry budget deficits (strange how the Democrats and Republicans have switched sides on this issue), but spend more on education, give more money to the states, etc.	2004-07-02

Mr. Sitchin is a believer that ancient astronaughts roamed the earth. He views artifacts carefully selected from around the world and explains their appearance in terms of modern reference. This book is a journal of many trips made over several years. It could serve as a summary of his findings and beliefs that are summarized in his other twelve books.<br />The author is an eminent member of the, I guess you would call it, 'alternative archeology' school. He looks at a statue of a girl, or a piece of carved stone and he sees evidence of space travel in the ancient past. That round thing on the head of a statue: could it be a helmet made of something tough to deflect a sword, or is it a crash helmet like those worn by pilots. That spaceship shaped piece of stone: is it a  model of a real space ship, or perhaps a model of a boat. That statue of a goddess holding a vase: why would she be carrying a clay pot type vase while wearing headphones with an unbilical cord attached to the back of her space suit while she is bare brested in front.<br />I look, I'm not so sure I see what he sees. Still it's a good book for summarizing an alternative past.	2004-07-02

It is rumored that when the Nazi Foreign Minister said to Churchill - \\"You will be facing not only us but also the Italians.\\" Churchill replied, \\"That's OK, we had them on our side last time, you're welcome to them.\\"<br />Rommel, on the other hand, spoke of them quite differently. During the famous \\"Desert Fox\\" actions in North Africa, Rommel had more Italian troops and more Italian armor than he had German. Rommel's comments were that Italian troops were properly led they were as capable as any. Italian generals were better as friends of Il Duce than they were as fighting people.<br />The Italian Littorio division did very good work at Tobruk, Gazala, and El Alamein. The Ariete division performed a dramatic day long stand at El Alamein effectively styming Allied plans to encircle and destroy the Axis forces. The Centauro division was brief but important in the American defeat at Kasserine Pass.<br />It is nice to see that this book, and a very few others, are beginning to show a side of the Italian Army not normally seen.	2004-07-02

That is a series of pages sewn together, usually with a spine and a cover. The codex form replaced the scroll as the most common form of manuscript in the early Christian period.<br />Lev Grossman uses this as center stage in this book about a mystery in three parts: the codex itself, the computer game, the character.<br />The character is interesting as he is an ordinary person, not a bibliophile. But as he delves further into the manuscript he becomes adicted (as all of us visiting this web site probably are).<br />The computer game seems to be an analogy of the book. I can sit and read for hours, engrossed in a novel or a history. My son cannot, but give him a computer game and he gets the same glassy eyed look.<br />Finally there's the Codex itself. An ancient manuscript that may or may not exist, and I'll leave that part to you.	2004-07-02

Every major military in the world has it's special elite units. The British have their SAS. The Americans the SEALS, Rangers, and Special Forces. Strangely enough, this trend began with the Italian Navy. Their Decima MAS unit pioneered the concept of small, specially trained units that did damage to their enemies far beyond their size. Movie buffs will recognize their exploits as shown in the 1958 movie 'The Silent Enemy' where frogmen attack the HMS Valiant and the HMS Queen Elizabeth using specially modified torpedoes that they ride into the harbour.<br />It is nice to see that the Italian military is portrayed here as something other than the bumbling fools so often shown in American films and books. This book treats the unit as they would any other unit, telling how it got started, their training, their failures and their successes. This book is also the basis for a new movie called 'The Sea Devils' although I understand that the project is now on hold.	2004-07-01

A fascinating book written by an African-American working for many years as a news reporter in Central and Western Africa. Mr. French subtitles the book The Tragedy and Hope of Africa. It seems that there is a lot more tragedy than hope. In a land rich in natural resources, rich in culture, rich in history, there is little reason to believe that there is any hope.<br />Perhaps it is the legacy of the colonial powers that did nothing to prepare the local people for independence, perhaps the drawing of arbitrary borders by the colonial powers neglecting such things as tribal borders (although with independence the countries have retained their old borders). Also, the Cold War was not kind to Africa. The Russians and Americans played their games of one up-manship. And with the end of the Cold War the support (such as it was) ended. Since then almost the entire continent has degenerated into civil wars, coups, and quite likely the worst governments in the world.<br />Now there is AIDS. Figures I hear say that AIDS may infect between one third and two thirds of the people of child bearing age. This rivals the plague years of the 1600's.<br />Mr. French writes a book of compashion, of understanding and unfortunately leave us with a sense of hopelessness.	2004-07-01

She starts this book with the story of working with the recently hired head of programming for CNN. He came from NBC Entertainment. One of his first questions to her was, &quot;What's a journalist?&quot; He then answered his own question by saying, &quot;We need younger, more attractive anchors (male and female) who project credibility.&quot; Note project credibility, not have credibility. And this was at CNN.<br />She then contrasts the way Arnold Schwarzenegger played the media during his election with the way Ronald Regan was treated by the media in 1966 when he ran for Governor. The difference is the development of Infotainment. Both candidates knew how the media worked and played it well. <br />We are now in the midst of a presidental election. What has the television news media told us about either candidate. Not much. Yet from what we see on television we are supposed to make up our minds about our leaders. <br />Ms. Anderson lived throught the time when the changes from straight news to infotainment were being made.

This is his sixth book on Russia.==This book is about how Russians have been thinking about their nation since the collapse. It is not a history of Russia, but an attempt to understand how the heirs of a great tradition are grappling under new conditions of freedom.<br />In many ways, the average Russian is worse off than before the collapse. How will this translate into voting for leaders in the coming years? Will Russia attempt to revert to its more authoritarian past? Can the country get through the times that it is now seeing and become an exemplory democracy? The book presents some interesting views based on talking with many Russian people.	2004-07-01

CIA counterterrorism agent Mitch Rapp is called upon to investigate and prevent a suspected terrorist attack using a nuclear device. Beyond this, I'll let you read the book.<br />Unfortunately this is a scene that just might get acted out. A lot of real life experts are getting concerned that this senario could be real. It might be wished that we could put the nuclear genie back in the bottle, but we can't. Their are instructions on the web about how to build a bomb. See or instance: Los Alamos Primer: The First Lectures on How to Build an Atomic Bomb (available from Amazon). Now you need the raw materials, and it helps if you have a rogue state (North Korea for instance) that claims they are reprocessing the spent fuel in a reactor to isolate the need stuff. Desparately broke, you just might go buy what you want from them. Then again, there's the 20,000 or more warheads the Soviets built, where are they?	2004-07-01

Remember this was an era before Sesame Street tought us that a few seconds of attention span is all that's needed, before politicans learned that the few second sound bite was all that's going to get on the air.<br />This was a time when the news was considered important instead of just another aspect of the ratings game.	2004-07-01

Within seconds the sender could have gone on the UPS web site and been informed that the book was delivered.<br />At the beginning someone at UPS had to envision the system and the technology that made it possible. It couldn't have been justified to management as a cost saving application as IT projects usually are. Instead someone had to say that this new technology can give us a marketing edge by providing something that other companies don't have. (No, I don't know if UPS was the first or that they were just doing what FedEx or someone else did first. If it was someone else, they had to make this analysis and UPS then had to do it to in order to meet competitive pressures.)<br />I went into this kind of long winded explanation because this is really what the book is about. Yes, it covers the technology, but more important it covers the overall system concepts of what, why, and how much that are so important to delivering a working system. Whether we realize it or not, we are living in an age of wireless digital communications. If it becomes your job to implement a system that isn't tied to wires, be it a handheld device, an ATM machine or something in a truck (or police car) this book will give you an excellent introduction to at least the questions you should ask.	2004-07-01

This book can be viewed as kind of the second volume in a series, except that it isn't a series. Volume 1 would be any of several excellent books that describe the best practices used during the planning, design and implementating Exchange Server. But after the system is up and running you had best not just go away and leave it alone.<br />The day to day use of Exchange Server requires that it be monitored and managed to keep it running smoothly. Included in this area are such topics as server resources, messaging connections, interoperability with foreign mail systems and Windows 2003 integration.<br />An important area, one that is increasing in importance, in handling Exchange Server is virus and junk mail protection. He gives several pointers to follow in selecting the anti-virus software you use (I wish he had gone just a bit further and given some names and comments about their software). In the area of junk e-mail or SPAM he discusses making sure that your system is not being used as an open relay by SPAMmers. He discusses commercial server-side e-mail filters to reduce the amount of e-mail (Again I wish he had given some names.) and even discusses how to build/modify your own filters for increased effectiveness.<br />This is a practical book for managers of e-mail systems, and one of the few around.	2004-07-01

The price of gasoline has just gone up again. And the radio is reporting the results of a Field poll in California that has 77% of their responders believing that the price increase is more the result of oil companies trying to increase their profits than legitimate changes in market conditions. Completely ignored are anti-polution laws that forced the closing of several refineries in California, the fact that gasoline sold in California has to have special treatment not required anywhere else in the world, that Iraq isn't shipping any oil, that China has been importing more than usual and the advent of SUV's and pickup trucks as family transportation have driven up demand. <br />This is not to say that the oil companies aren't above maniuplating the market to make as much as possible. They have certainly acted that way before. But the essential facts that the amount of oil being discovered is less than the amount of oil being used, that there is a fixed amount of oil in the ground and that it is getting harder to produce are ignored. Neither Kerry nor Bush is going to fix the problem. They are much more concerned about getting into office than the real problem which is that oil production is going to peak in 2015 or perhaps 2030 and that oil as a fuel for motor vehicles is going to dramatically increase in price to the point that we simply will not be able to afford it.<br />This book is an exhaustive look at the oil supply in the world. He makes his points carefully and completely. He points out what we can do to make the problem much easier, but admits that we aren't doing them. Americans, and I guess people everywhere wait until something like Pearl Harbour before they are willing to make such changes. <br />I would also like to have seen a chapter on what Mr. Roberts thinks would happen as gasoline becomes more expensive. What will $5 per gallon prices do - not much, Europe is already there. What will $10 per gallon do, what about $50 per gallon.	2004-07-01

This is a book I find very amusing - the writing style is just great, even the saddest, most trajic subjects are trreated with humor. Who can ignore a chapter entitled 'First, they killed John Wayne'. And the chapter is on the radiation problems in Southern Utah from the above ground nuclear tests.<br />This is a book I find very sad - 80% of the cast of the movie 'The Conqueror' (starring John Wayne as Genghis Khan) died of cancer, perhaps from filming down wind of the nuclear tests. But this testing was fifty years ago. Eventually the governments of the world got together and ended such testing.<br />This is a book that I find incomplete. Yes, anyone in their right mind would be opposed to having a nuclear waste storage area or a chemical weapons incinerator in their back yards. But what I don't hear is an alternative. There's a nuclear power station in New York, just 30 miles up the Hudson from New York City. Do we just leave the stuff there as an inviting target for another World Trade Center type attack. What would an airplane crashing into the storage area do? Or, do we leave the chemical munitions, now old and leaking in storage areas just off the end of the runway in Denver waiting for an airplane to land short.<br />I rate this book quite highly, it's well worth your time to help understand the problems. I'd also like to see a couple of chapters on solutions, not just on the problems.	2004-06-30

They seem to report, without a personal bias, what everyone they could find had to say.  The book contained neither the venomous hatred of the e-mail, nor the gushing praise of a political press release.

In addition, you'll have greater confidence that your application will be free of bugs.<br />Tapestry applications are still servlet applications. With enough code and enough time to debug that code there is nothing you can do with Tapestry that you can't do with a servlet application. But you cna do it faster, easier.<br />The book is written by Howard Lewis Ship. He is the creator and original designer of Tapestry and has made a remarkable effort to listen to users, understand their needs, and address their requirements. He was instrumental in the formation of the Tapestry community that has made Tapestry a part of the Apache Jakarta family. Tapestry is a companion project of other popular projects including Struts, Tomcat and log4J. More than most writers, Mr. Ship understands what you need to know to become more productive. He has written the book in a manner that leads the beginner along, and provides the expert with what they need to know. Excellent writing, excellent book.	2004-06-29

Grant's Overlooked Military Genius	Books	5	16	21	N	N	A Modest Revision of History	Perhaps it is the American tradition of rooting for the underdog. Perhaps it is the influence of movies like 'Gone With the Wind' that have created a golden image of the south (In spite of the South's Peculiar Institution - Slavery.) But for whatever reason, Robert E. Lee has been raised to almost God like esteem, while Grant has been considered a drunken butcher.<br />Of late, the reputation of Lee has suffered some. Incidents like Picketts Charge have been looked more closely in the reliaziation that Lee's most trusted Liutenant, Longstreet recommended against the Gettysburg campaign so heavily. <br />It is good to see that Grant is getting a new look. He led a masterful series of military campaigns, often over the objections of his superiors such as Hallack. And in the end, he won the war. Dr. Bonekemper does not go into the troubles Grant had as a civilian, either before the war or during his presidency. But after all, this is not a biography of Grant but a military history. Well done, well written, highly recommended.	2004-06-28

This books works on the eternal question: Are we alone in the Universe.<br />It's clear that a tremendous number of things had to happen just exactly right for life to develop as it has. Just the right temperature, the amazing characteristics of water at this temperature range, exactly the correct amount of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other elements and compounds necessary for life.<br />There was a school of thought centered around the late Carl Sagen that there must be a lot of life in the Universe. He estimated that there were as many as a million civilizations in the Milky Way alone. Since then a revisionist school has come about. The authors of this book have collected a massive amount of knowledge about the nature of life on our planet, much of it just developed in recent years. Their conclusion is that the circumstances surrounding life on earth make it more rare than previous studies might have believed.<br />Does it prove that we are alone in the universe, absolutely not, it is theoretically impossible to prove a negative. You can only prove a positive, and this question will remain until we receive a signal from outer space or perhaps when a UFO joins the flight pattern at the airport in Washington, London or where ever.	2004-06-26

Jane Austen's novels end just after the wedding ceremony. It appears that she wrote about her own experiences, which contained no husband, even apparently no lovers. As a (presumably) proper Victorian maiden she couldn't write about these nasty unmentionable things. But we all know (if we are or ever have been married) that the wedding ceremony just marks a transition from one kind of life to another.<br />Linda Berdoll describes herself as a Texas Farm Wife who couldn't help wondering what happened to Darcy and Elizabeth after the wedding. After a few years of wondering, she put pen to paper (well probably a computer with a word processor) and produced a racy sequel to the preliminary book.<br />As with all such works, some will find it wonderful, some will find it wonderful, some will find it a disgrace. Since Jane Austen hasn't been around for almost two hundred years, it is difficult to say how she would have felt.	2004-06-25

Sooner or later you'll want to sell your work, and who better to sell it to than Leslie Wainger, the Executive Editor of Harlequin Books, quite likely the biggest romance publisher.<br />After twenty five years of being in the romance publishing business, she knows what the readers want.

The British got theirs at Dunkirk, the Americans at Kasserine Pass. The qualities that make up a good peace time officer aren't the ones that are needed when the Army goes to War. The Russians got their lesson in Finland. They learned that you don't purge all the competant officers for political reasons and then expect the yes-men to do well. <br />Finland had a pathetic little army: not a single anti-tank gun, only about a dozen modern fighter planes, their field radios weighed 300 pounds and didn't work well in winter, stocks of machine gun and artillery ammunition were very low, all in all, in no condition to wage war against the largest army in the world.<br />On November 30, 1939 Russia started the war. About a quarter of a million Russian soldiers died, and about 25,000 Finns. It's an almost ignored (in the US) part of World War II.	2004-06-25

Exhaustively researched, this book covers every aspect of the battle from the first hint that a battle might be coming to the last confederate retreating back across the Potomac.  This book is not the place to start a study of the Civil War, but is indespensable for the well-versed.<br />I think it would be possible to use this book to find out about the actions of almost every soldier on the battlefield those days. It seems that every regiment, of every division, of every corp is covered. I would say that there is so much here that you can't make sense out of it, but that isn't true. The general descriptions of what is happening come first, then the increasing detail down to the smaller units. <br />I read this just after reading the book Gettysburg by Gingrich/Forstchen. I found the comparison fascinating. Meade in moving up to Gettysburg wrote a memo advocating a defensive battle at Pipe Creek - but that really belongs in the review of another book.	2004-06-25

During this war he developed a war fighting style that eventually won the war. (To be sure, he was not up against England's best who were somewhat occupied with a fellow named Napoleon.)<br />Washington's technique was not unlike what later military leaders would use, pull back when faced with superior forces, attach where the enemy is weak and attack when an attack isn't expected. But Washington was doing this when it hadn't been done, this wasn't the way gentlemen armies of Europe fought a war.<br />A particualr strength of this book is the emphasis on how Washington handled the troops. Without the underpaid, almost starving, ill clad soldiers he couldn't ahve won. And he kept them together.	2004-06-25

The result couldn't have turned out any different.  I looked south, towards Washington, there had to be a place down there where Lee could find a hill for the Union to have to charge. Lincoln wouldn't have let the Army of the Potomac not attack.<br />I looked, I thought, I didn't do anything about it.<br />Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen looked at the same situation and researched it some more. They found that Meade had really wanted Lee to attack him at Pipe Creek. They found that Longstreet had told Lee that going around to the south and letting Meade attack them, but was overruled.==Then instead of forgetting it, they wrote a book where Lee responded to Longstreet with an &quot;OK, let's do that.&quot; -- Excellent reading, obviously this is the first of a series.

Why at that time?<br />Dr. Bernstein - you can see more of his thinking at his website -- [...] -- says that there are four conditions necessary for this kind of development/growth: Property Rights (where advances are not confiscated by the government), Scientific Rationalism (remember Galileo put under house arrest for the absurd belief that the Earth goes around the Sun), Capital Markets (with some honesty), and a working Transportation/Communication system (so you can sell what you make).<br />He brings up some very interesting points, on the relationship between culture and religion.  It has been obvious that the differences between Christian Europe and the impoverished Muslin world are immense. His view is that this is not because of the religion, but of the basic underlying culture.  Well worth your time.	2004-06-24

The book presents a view of the Muslim world that is quite different from others such as Huntington's &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; which holds that the next big struggles between Muslims and the Christians will be the world's next big battlefield based on cultural differences. Mamdani sees the Muslim's current actions as an extension of the Cold War. (He grew up in Africa, among who's nations the US and the Soviet Union fought the war.) That he is probably right does not alter Huntington's view in my mind.<br />I'd also like to see a chapter, maybe two, on the impact of oil on the crisis.

Mohammed was both a religious and military leader. (He was pretty good until he came up against one of the Greats - Genghis Kahn.) There seems to be to me more of an emphasis on uniting the two in the current Muslim thinking.<br />I really like his closing statement: &quot;To win the fight against terrorism requires accepting that the world has changed, ... that to occupy foreig places will be expensive, in lives and money.

For a long time (centuries perhaps?) the Y chromosome has been decaying. It has lost many of its genes, and become much less healthy.  If this continues, it will go away.  And if it goes away, there will be no men.  And of course, with no men, there are no women either. Delightful book.	2004-06-23
