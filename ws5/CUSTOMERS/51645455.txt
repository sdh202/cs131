9216:US	51645455	R11TJ8K8RC7GVV	0740748475	784267948	The Complete Calvin and Hobbes [Box Set]	Books	5	62	71	N	Y	A must-have for many reasons and an insight into the creator of the strip	Many people here are probably familiar with Calvin and Hobbes, with the often manic Calvin and his comrade in adventure/escapades, Hobbes. Many have probably already bought various compilations of the comic strips and looked through them again and again. So why buy THIS collection?<br /><br />  Mainly because it goes WAY beyond anything else that is already out there - and not just because it contains EVERY single one of the comic strips in one collection, nicely slipcased. Buy it  because it comes closest to reflecting what Bill Watterson, creator of these comics, wanted, exceptional color quality, pretty much up to his very perfectionistic standards. Buy it because for the first time you'll see the comic in as close to perfect form as you'll find...and yes, buy it because you'll finally have all of the strips in one set.<br /><br />  How much of a perfectionist was Watterson when it came to having control over his beloved characters? Well, imagine turning down a call from Steven Spielberg because you just aren't interested in collaborating with anyone, genius or not, on a work based on your comic strip. Imagine giving up lucrative contracts for lunch boxes, animated films, stuffed Calvin and Hobbes figures.<br /><br />  Whether you think that turning down all those potentially lucrative opportunities was admirable or crazy, there is no denying that he poured his heart, soul and psyche into his work, not distracted by meetings about the design of a lunch box or the  decal that woould appear on clothing.<br /><br />  Nope, he just did his work, day in and day out, until he decided, at an early age (around 37) that he'd done enough and simply....stopped. That was a sad day for me,as I'd grown to love Calvin and Hobbes and their unique world, one in which you never really knew the names of Calvin's parents (anyone know?), one in which his teacher could morph into a monster, one that exemplified the psyche of one little boy so well and which hasn't been equaled since.	2005-10-09

How had I changed since then? How would that affect my life now? How would I forge a new identity, date, possibly open myself up to remarriage?<br /><br />I was also curious about how living as a single woman over 40  would compare to being single in one's 20s, when viewpoints (and, possibly, physical appearance) can be quite different from women who have aged, gone through several relationships and, as a result, possibly matured and grown wiser.<br /><br />This book didn't disappoint. While some selections were bittersweet, otherw were humorous, matter of fact or deeply honest. When I finished this book, I felt better for the experience. I also loved the fact that it can be picked up and read in sections, not having to go through it in any particular order.<br /><br />Several selections stood out but I particularly liked Joyce Maynard's account of an online dating experience with a guy who seened promising online but, in person, presented a much different personality than she expected, making a simple discussion over cup of Chai seem...painful and baffling. She portrays the baffling world that can confront women who bravely risk dating but with different perspectives than when they were younger. As I read her account, I felt like I was right there, living every uncomfortable and agonizing moment (but it was written with a light touch and parts were humorous). This is just one of many standout pieces in this collecton.	2005-10-07
12944:US	51645455	R3QRVYCSAVNK6F	140004314X	40124125	The Year of Magical Thinking	Books	5	760	793	N	Y	Deserves to become a classic memoir about grief and loss	I stayed up almost all might just to finish reading it, unable to put this down, although I confess I had to keep a box of tissues nearby. I've lost 5 people in the last few years and, just recently, another friend and so I related very strongly to this book.<br /><br />Didion's unflinching account of the sudden loss of her husband (which occurred while their only child was in a coma in a hospital (!)) deserves to be a classic in the genre of books written by and for those who are grieving. It is hard to find books like this, which are both honest but not overly sentimental, not resorting to the tropes which seem to surround death. She doesn't offer vague platitudes or advice. She simply relates her very personal experience, including the inevitable vulnerability, unexpected moments of being blindsided by memories and sudden tears, etc.<br /><br />She covers all the bases, including the kind of insanity that can seize one in the throes of grief, those moments when you forget the person is actually dead, when you turn to speak to him or her as you normally would at a certain part of the day or reach for the phone to share the latest news.<br /><br />The book is raw. If you're looking for religous or spiritual guidance and inspiration, this is not the book for you. As Didion herself noted, writing about the book recently, it was intentionally written \\"raw\\". I assume she didn't want to wait, to distance herself from the intensity of the experience as she wrote it down, quite unlike many other books she has written. Raw or not, it wasn't sloppy, overly sentimental or complete despairing.<br /><br />It was simply honest, heartwrenchingly so, and Didion doesn't deviate from communicating, in absolute striking detail, the sense of alienation and disorientation that separates mourners from those who seem to be living \\"normal\\" lives. Grief is its own territory, separate from so-called normalcy. In so many ways, it is an illness, an affliction of the spirit and not one that can be cured in any one way.<br /><br />An aside- the photo of Didion inside the dustjacket is haunting. No question that those are the eyes of someone who has been scraped to the core, wounded and, presumably, still recovering. There is something beautiful in that portrait and, oddly, comforting. It is the face of a survivor, however hard it might be to live as one.<br /><br />This book will remain on my bookshelf and I expect I'll be thumbing through it for solace time and again. Reading it was both painful and cathartic and strangely comforting, with an intensity that left me awestruck. I am still amazed that she was able to produce such a beautifully written book in the throes of so much pain.he photo of Didion inside the dustjacket is haunting.

The author notes cultural and social pressures that can lead children from strong families down the wrong path (although she is clear that sometimes parents DO make mistakes and that the root cause of problems may be a combination of factors).<br /><br />An emphasis on a broad look at the many forces that can cause problems, from peer pressure to societal changes.<br /><br />A STRONG focus on living in the HERE and NOW, rather than obsessing about past mistakes.<br /><br />Lots of real life examples, showing how parents dealt with truly difficult situations.<br /><br />No \\"one answer fits all\\" solutions. Instead, the author's style is brisk and open, inviting the reader to think about the issue, rather than arrive at definite answers.<br /><br />This is an easy read and I got through it in one day, although I think several sections deserve rereading. I intend to keep it on my bookshelf and turn to it again, for inspiration, advice and comfort.<br /><br />I also intend to read other books on the subject, as I want to get different viewpoints and perspectives.	2005-07-05

This is a book to savor, as Chadwick unfurls the life of Tom Ripple, a man who simply records his perceptions about life.	2005-06-24

Then you'll have to contend with the people who've read the book and are using \\"fake\\" signs and tells, trying to throw people off the reality of their hand. That will work for only so long, of course.<br /><br />So do you feel lucky? For how long? Are you playing against a pro or are you just going for some easy money for a night or two? Whatever your agenda, this book may help. But keep in mind that if YOU are reading it, someone else (maybe a pro) is reading it too. There is a learning curve here, folks...staying ahead of the curve is the real challenge...and no one book will teach you that. But this book will do a great job of keeping you on top of the average game, maybe even the above average game... and it might even speed up your learning curve. Reason enough to buy it.	2005-06-05

Vividly written, conjuring up the day to day struggles of trying to stay afloat, Levison had me totally riveted from page one. I wish the author would come up with even more works of nonfiction...and I wonder what has happened to him since this book was written.	2005-05-27

Written with great care and love as well as attention to detail, this book contains over 500 illustrations as well as biographies of the greatest artists in the field. Now rare, it isn't one to pass up, as I'm sure it will only become more desirable in years to come. The reproduction quality is nothing short of superb! Very impressive.	2005-05-07

He has decided to force himself to finish out his days with order and a mission - and that mission is to complete a story that he feels compelled to tell, a tale of war which also mirrors the conflicts, joys and losses in his own life.<br /><br />  It took the author, Peter Pouncey, over 20 years to write this book and his attention to detail makes each page totally engrossing. This book deserves to be a classic.	2005-05-07

Hopefully, it will inspire those suffering from postpartum depression to seek appropriate treatment - rather than deny the reality...or worse, be ashamed of their feelings. After all, most people learn to parent \\"on the job\\", having to hit the ground running after the baby is born. It isn't always a natural transition, although there has been a cultural and historical misconception that it should be.<br /><br />  Shields has written a thoughtful, heartfelt book and deserves credit for having the courage to admit that she didn't have a smooth transition from pregnancy to parenthood. In fact, from what she's written here, she was on the verge of suicide at times..and definitely having suicidal thoughts. The overwhelming depression hit her suddenly and completely without warning.<br /><br />  I remember Brooke Shields from the days when she appeared in catalogs as a child model or in magazines in fashion spreads,first as a relatively unknown child models alongside top fashion models -- and then coming into her own. Suddenly, almost overnight (although it had actually taken years of hard work),  it seemed she was appearing everywhere, eventually segueing her modeling success (and combination of child/woman looks) into  movies and television and even Broadway shows.<br /><br />  I admit that I have always wondered how much of a real, down to earth life she EVER had and so I also admit to a bit (only a bit) of skepticism here. Where, I wonder, is the distinction between postpartum depression and the shock of having a baby (which could throw chaos into the most well-organized life)? Perhaps she had a bit of \\"real life shock\\" as well. And perhaps I am wrong about this and she was totally in the thrall of a biochemical imbalance. In any case, this makes for a fascinating glimpse into another facet of someone who has long been in the public eye.	2005-05-03

I'm relatively new to the experience so some of my attempts (using other cookbooks) haven't passed muster with her. My pasta was too mushy, my sauces too watery...nothing came out right or tasted as it should. And, much as I hate to admit it, she was right.<br /><br />  But THIS book...every recipe in it has been one that she has found truly delicious, even asking for the recipes -which I consider high praise indeed, since she USED to tell me (in detail) what I was doing wrong, in my earlier attempts at cooking authentic Italian foods.<br /><br />  From antipasti to desserts, not a single recipe has been a flop. I've a little afraid to share the recipes, however, because I don't want her to know how simple most of them are!  They honestly taste like they took hours of prep time but they didn't.  I don't have a lot of time so that is an added bonus!	2005-05-02

I grew up watching Goldie Hawn on Laugh-in and then in movies- everything from Butterflies are Free (where her hippie, dippy side got to cut loose) to Private Benjamin.<br /><br />  All along, she seemed both funny and gutsy but what REALLY got me to buy this book was a television profile where Goldie spoke of a long battle with depression and insecurity. Her longtime companion, Kurt Russell, and their children (some from previous marriages) also appeared and I realized that there might be more depth and complexity to this woman than I got from the fleeting images on screen.<br /><br /> Thankfully, I was right. This book was a joy to read, revealing the depth, intellect and pure gutsiness that Goldie Hawn possesses. She was brave enough to reveal the insecurities and pain that she felt during some of her early years in show biz as well as the joy she felt as she discovered Buddhism, met Russell, gave birth to her children - and so much more. Written with a unique style (would you expect anything else from Hawn?) the reader will find both entertainment and inspiration within this one.	2005-05-02

This book would be at the top of my list for any parent or parent-to-be. It is simply that good and original, with a special, unique voice. And I say that after picking it up half-heartedly, thinking, \\"Oh, no..not ANOTHER parenting memoir\\" I thought I'd read just about every variation of that sort of book that was out there. In fact, for a time it was an obsession of mine.<br /><br />  So I was pleasantly surprised to find that I couldn't stop reading this one, as the author was totally honest about both the trials and the joys of parenting, revealing the hardships as well as the rewards - in detail, yet with such quirky humor that I was laughing out loud for a good share of the time.<br /><br />  What makes this book special is the way she describes her daily life and the personality of her young son, Ben, in a way that makes clear how exasperatingly difficult her job can be one moment, how sweet the next. She is clearly not the \\"perfect mother\\" (is anyone?) and her courage in revealing her doubts, fears and foibles is oddly comforting to read.<br /><br />  This is a book for those of us who want to be good parents but need communion with those who are like us - aspiring to be better at our job, but having moments that are all too human as well, when we don't live up to our hopes, our expectations. It is this author's particular gift that she is able to own up to these moments without excuses or defensiveness, shedding new light on the complexities of parenthood, admitting that she was surprised by the radical changes in her life, even discombobulated by them at times. And yet she also comes across as a devoted and loving mother, fiercely passionate about her children. I absolutely loved this book!	2005-04-24

Young , charming...and the man can cook. He is about to have a new show on television but I haven't seen that yet so I'll just stick to info about this book.<br /><br />  His food isn't generally the type that you spend all day slaving in the kitchen to prepare, so if you really enjoy the challenge of an elaborate, complicated recipe (which can be fun and gratifying in its own way), you won't find much of that here. From beet salads with goat cheese to fried fish and quick beverages, he focuses on food that befits his experience and background (he grew up cooking in his family's kosher kitchen and he went on cook economical, but gourmet, meals while at college). Most of the recipes would fit a standard American budget - and not one based on caivar and champagne, although there are some exceptions.<br /><br />  By the way, if you need a good gift for the college grad, forget the pen and pencil sets, the briefcases, watches and other typical grad gifts for someone starting out in life. GIve them this instead and they'll REALLY impress visitors, clients and guests!	2005-04-23

That was part of the unique charm, eccentricity and genius of Jean Shepherd, a man who was a wonderful writer as well (anyone who has ever seen A Christmas story, complete with Ralphie and his coveted BB gun, has come in contact with one of Shepherd's works).<br /><br />Bergmann has really done his homework in writing this bio of Shepherd and the results make for a wonderful read and a glimpse into days when radio really had an impact on people, a time when people took the time to listen to stories on the radio, something that may be making a bit of a comeback (as evidenced by Prairie Home Companion and other shows which feature short stories and other works read aloud). Shepherd was a pioneer, however, and no one has come close to his skill and genius. This book goes a long way in explaning why while it also reveals the particular demons that tormented and drove Shepherd. Highly recommended!	2005-04-19

A photogenic baby is pushed into modeling by her mother ( unless a baby can \\"decide\\" to have a modeling career).<br /><br />2. She turns into a lovely child who is a popular model.<br /><br />3. When she turns 12, she morphs into a teen who can look older than her years and so, based on her looks, she becomes the hot model of the moment.<br /><br />4. Great photographers get some great photos of her, but some of them toe the line between sexiness and child porn. Is is \\"art\\" or \\"porn\\" when a child poses topless in a bathtub, looking seductively at the camera? Is it cute or borderline dangerous to have a young girl play a child prostiture, potentially encouraging the fantasies of pedophiles? These are some of the real and controversial issues surrounding the career of Ms. Shields.<br /><br />5. But she never became (yet) a world class actress. She was simply gorgeous.<br /><br />  And this is enough to form an obsession...and boost up the price of this book? Guess so. People can be so strange.	2005-04-13

To my way of thinking, totally confident, joyful people don't throw up in toilets a good part of the time.<br /><br />I learned that the woman that I'd thought of as an independent, thoughtful woman was obsessed with the opinions of the men around her and strongly shaped by her cold, emotionally distant father. Rather than being independent, she spent much of her time trying to win over the men in her life, only to end up with several failed marriages and some degrading sexual moments when she didn't have the courage to speak up for her herself and just say \\"No, I won't do this. No, I'm not comfortable with this.\\"<br /><br />  To be fair, there is also revelation here and the reader may learn from Fonda's mistakes - if she/he doesn't put the book down first. Many young women are still making those same mistakes, still subject to eating disorders, still trying to please others more than themselves, still trying to fit impossible expectations for themselves and to \\"do it all\\"  instead of doing enough and doing what is right for THEM as individuals.<br /><br /> Even so, at a certain point when I was reading Fonda's book, I  thought, \\"Enough, already!\\" It took a lot of willpower to keep going to the bitter end as she revealed what seemed to be every intimate detail of her life in a totally confessionary way, almost as though all the old ghosts and emotional demons had to be revealed - in public. And I couldn't help asking - why?<br /><br />Her insights and revelations simply weren't enough to make up for the sadness I felt for her public exposure, pain and vulnerability. I hope this book does the good she wants it to but I can't help wondering if the public will find this book more gossip-worthy than inspirational (and a part of me couldn't help wondering if that wasn't one motivation for writing the book, to get people talking about her yet again).<br /><br />  I hope I'm wrong and I wish her well. I also hope she finds the peace that seems to have eluded her for so much of her life and the sense of self-worth that she deserves, for the personal growth she has struggled so hard to achieve, for the fine actress she has proven herself to be time and again and the perception and intelligence that shines through in her interviews on both film and radio. As she ages, she seems to be truly striving for wisdom and personal growth and it is never too late for anyone to learn.<br /><br />  But - still-  I hope she steers away from more works of self-confession such as these in the future and lets her newfound sense of joy and validation shine in the life she lives publicly, on screen and off, rather than on the written page. If they're anything like this one, I, for one, won't be eager to pick up another book she writes.d I couldn't help asking - why?

There are additional tips on tournament play and then there is the advice by other card playing experts.<br /><br />  All of this makes the book worth buying because - when it comes right down to it- you never know when the right kernel of info might just be what you need - at that crucial moment. And face it - if you're a pro (or aspiring to be one) you aren't going to be able to resist reading this or you'll drive yourself nuts wondering if there is some little tidbit that could help you win that next hand. So don't fight the urge.	2005-04-06

A bizarre mix of everything you'd expect from Stewart, including nude portraits of the Supreme Court Justices - and more. Clearly, good taste was not on the agenda - but then, who'd expect that in a book like this?<br />  Reading this, I was intrigued enough to go back and reread some of the books I should have read first time through my schooling. Gotta give credit to Stewart for that..wonder if some creative soul will come up with a way to build this book into the curriculum of some high school or college? Hah - they'd never get away with it.	2005-04-06

It is detailed and as close to objective as any book thus far on the case and yet written so vividly that it is near impossible to put down.<br /><br /> The author's reasoning is solid and backed up by actual transcipts which shed light on the whole case. I came away with a real sense of loss for Laci's family as well as a deeper awareness of how and why Scott could have done it.<br /><br /> In all honesty, I was so overwhelmed by all the media hoopla that I didn't even intend to buy this book but I actually read some sections of it while waiting for a friend to purchase another book in a bookstore...by the time, she got through the checkout line, I HAD to buy this book. It was simply that well written.<br /><br />  After you finish it, I'd suggest you try reading The Sociopath Next Door. If you do, you'll realize how easily sociopaths fit in to society (most aren't even in jail!) and the information from both books may very well save your life and/or help you identify the next person who could commit such a crime.	2005-04-06

Pulling no punches, Moore lets it all hang out...her abusive parents, her pain and despair and sense of hopelessness and her obsession with food. At the heart of the book is her loathing of her body, the container she would NOT have chosen to house her spirit.	2005-04-06

Luckily, most of us don't have dissociative states that are that severe but, as the author points out time and again, we all exhibit some dissociatve behaviors from time to time and for good reason - as a survival mechanism.<br /><br />  Filled with inspiring as well as mindboggling stories of people whose lives have been greatly affected by dissociation and then remade, The Myth of Sanity reveals the very thin veneero of normalcy we all live with and the small amount of true consciousness accessible to our awareness...but with so many layers buried underneath.<br /><br /> The author also offers insights as to how we can recognize our own moments of altered consciousness and what to do about these moments, to embrace them as well as to learn and grow from the lessons they may teach us.	2005-04-02

They're often smart, amazingly resourceful and  difficult to catch.<br /><br />In addition to gving real life examples of sociopaths and detailed explanations about what creates them, the author writes of valuable steps we can take to detect the sociopaths among us and protect ourselves and our friends and family from them.	2005-03-27

But here's the latest scoop: Sin City is now in movie form, a form strongly overseen by Miller himself (who was, understandably, suspicious and reluctant to let his work be potentially bastardized on film) He'd worked hard enough to get his own series and I doubt he liked the idea of putting it in other hands. Luckily, he had an integral part in the production and it shows.<br />  Still, you might well want to check out his books first because they'll prepare you for the strong noir atmospher of the film, the grittiness, the corruption various levels of society. In other words, you'll know what to expect, although the movie is still something other than the comic in tone and style, pleasurable in its own right. So biy the book and then hit the movie theatres.	2005-03-24

She expands my vision, my view of the world and of the amazing varities of people - good, bad and in-between. Her insight is amazing and I always look forward to reading her books, even when she isn't at her best.<br /><br />Happily, this book is among her best. In fact, I think it IS her best yet because:<br /><br />1. It features Dectective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his partner Barbara Havers, two of my favorite characters created by George.<br /><br />2. The plot is thoroughly engaging, dealing with serial murders as well as possible racism and George's increasing skills as a writer are evident from the first page to the last. Within a page, I was riveted.<br /><br />3. Solid and surprising twists and turns, including a tragedy in the police force itself.<br /><br />4. An ending that will leave you spellbound, if not stunned.<br /><br />5. The complexity and passion that marks George's work at its best and an exploration into her characters' deepest ambitions, hopes, fears and dreams.<br /><br />  Fans of the writer will be delighted to savor this one and those new to her writing will be immediately hooked.	2005-03-23

The tips on how to break the ice in each country and join in conversations<br />2.Menu decoders and suggestions for each country<br />3.Essential words to get you through transportation checkpoints and on your way<br />4.

A list of recommended documents in addition to the necessary ones (passport, airline tickets). He makes sure to mention that any traveler should have 3 photocopies of the front pages of their passport (good security tip) a Hostel Card and an International Student ID card. Tons of lists of phone numbers for every situation, from getting a passport quickly to current websites for getting money saving rail passes.<br /><br />2. Detailed lists of what to pack - geared to the BACKPACKER. Clearly, backpackers aren't going to want any extra weight and the author keeps this in mind. This section alone could avoid any extra hassle or frustration.<br /><br />3. One scruple I had with this book. The author does give guidelines on \\"cramming\\" which is basically a way of staying at a hotel free and fooling the employees. Clearly, he is thinking of saving money but not of the ethical ramifications.<br /><br />4. How to keep parents happy while you are traveling.<br /><br />5. How to handle tough situations like losing your passport, Eurail pass or even what to do if you break the law and are arrested (hopefully, a situation that won't have to be faced).<br /><br />6.

How many people graduate from high school and even college within knowing the basics of financial literacy - deciphering credit ratings, maintaining and balancing a bank account, getting through college with a minimum of student debt, making the most of that first job and, eventually, buying a home and planning for retirement?<br />  Orman strives to close this \\"financial illiteracy\\" gap by providing invaluable info for those just starting out - although I found plenty of information I needed to know as well - and I'm well outside the \\"young and broke\\" range she seems to be targeting.<br />  The info is not only cutting edge but many of the websites have NOT appeared in other books. One example of how new the info is: Orman notes the recent changes in credit rules noting that EVERYONE has access to a FREE credit report once a year.<br />  Because she knows younger adults may be intimidated by a ton of financial info, Orman (wisely) delivers her advice in innovative, user-friendly ways. Each page is short, easy to read and yet chock full of info. In short, she doesn't waste words.<br /> Each section is launched with a Lowdown on what will be covered in the chapter and there is a quick summary at the end with checklists to make sure readers know what they shouldn't have missed. A Glossary at the back of the book explains some of the more complex terms. Important website resources and key terms are boldfaced in green, a great asset when looking for important info.<br />  Reading this book could help young people avoid many pitfalls, since Orman covers the basics such as:<br />* Understanding that all important credit rating and deciphering your FICO score<br /><br />*Making a small paycheck stretch as far as possible while maximizing opportunites for career advancement.<br /><br />* A special area on her website where buyers of the book can get UPDATES on info in the book and CONNECT with others on message boards, a great way to get info and share viewpoints (and Suze stops in regularly to answer a few select questions, giving readers an opportunity to have her answer YOUR questions)<br /><br />* Current websites to get information quickly and fill in gaps. She even notes that readers can now get their FICO score FREE once a year, valuable information that is on the cutting edge of new legislation. This info alone could well be worth the price of the book.<br /><br />* The rignt and wrong way to handle student debt<br /><br />* How to start investing and the best funds for ROth IRAs and 401(k) accoutns.<br /><br />* Buying a car, auto insurance and a home.<br /><br />  I consider this MUST reading for anyoone just starting an independent life and this will definitely be at the top of my gift list for any high school or college graduate.

They need it, too, judging from the behavior problems shown on the show, which my friends (guiltily) confess aren't that different from the same sorts of issues they face with their kids. Tantrums. Back talk. Kids that seem out of control, constantly fighting with their siblings and basically causing lots of stress in their families.<br /><br />  There is an art to good parenting and Jo Frost has it down pat, even though she could be considered a \\"stand-in parent\\" since she has the opportunity to go home when her work day is over. Luckily, she is more than happy to share her secrets with other parents, especially those who need to toughen their backbones and get back in charge of their kids. This book is sure to be a lifesaver for many a frazzled parent!.	2005-03-13

Although it isn't easy for those with ADHD to function in structured environments, they can excel in the right ones.<br /><br />  And that is the main strength of this book - showing how nonlinear, innovative minds can be an asset rather than a detriment. Along the way, the author helps people focus on their strengths and get around their weaknesses.	2005-03-09

Sure, there are some good ideas but I found myself frustrated by the very small section of color photos.<br /><br />  Also, some of the tips needed to be explained more clearly. In particular, the section on flower arranging needed more than a description of vases and suitable flowers. Photos or even illustrations would have been extremely helpful.<br /><br />  For those of you who are do-it-yourselfers, there are plenty of easy projects like chair throws and and floor runners but no examples of what they look like in various rooms.<br /><br />  If you ALREADY know what you want to put in your rooms, this book could be an excellent guide to finding or making the items inexpensively. Otherwise, I'd opt for something with more photos and examples.	2005-03-04

Having a child with a severe disease which WILL kill her and soon..<br /><br />  UNLESS<br /><br />2. Another child is conceived (within the same family) which can contribute blood and bone marrow to keep her alive. The parents go ahead and have that child, solely to keep their other child alive (yes, this situation is ripped from actual events of recent years, but still made compelling in this author's hands).<br /><br />  NOW IMAGINE:<br /><br />3. The donor child, in spite of her great love for her sister, wants to stop giving pieces of herself away, for reasons that become clear only later on. She hires a lawyer to fight for her interests.<br /><br />  This is when the novel takes off, racheting up the tension notch by notch. There is a catch in the whole story, a plot twist that isn't revealed until the last few days of court testimony, one that blew me away and moved me to tears.<br /><br />  And then...the author decides to throw in a final, added twist which is just too far beyond coincidence to be believable. It will be reassuring, perhaps, to those who believe \\"everything happens for a reason\\". Other readers may feel let down.<br /><br />  Even with the disappointing ending, I could not get the dilemna presented in this book out of my mind. It haunted me and the \\"what ifs?\\" reverberated in my mind for days. For that reason alone, I'd recommend this book. I just wish the author had opted not to chose the particular ending she did. I'd rather the conclusion wasn't quite so pat.	2005-02-24

It was really ahead of its time since even now few cookbooks have recipes this good that can be prepared quickly...and far too many of them include trendy foods that kids won't touch. NOT this one. Just good basic fare- spaghetti, mashed potatoes, Tossed saland and lots of desserts.<br /><br />  So many things set this cookbooks apart from the numerous imitators that have come along. Real kids were used as \\"testers\\" and their opinions were actually quoted. Also, most of the recipes taste really good - to KIDS. Parents, however, may be less enthursiastic, perhaps because some of the recipes called for canned soup or some other form of packaged ingredient, many  with preservatives. But many also use fresh ingredients and the Chili is still a particular favorite of ours, being neither two spicy or too bland, all made from scratch. The Noodle Goulash and Basic Fried drumstricks are pretty good, too.<br /><br />  The comments from the kids are priceless.(\\"Betty Crocker said not to worry about a crack in your nut bread...it's supposed to be there\\").<br /><br />  Crocker was also ahead of her time by including illustrations of boys in the kitchen as often as girls, neatly sidestepping any sexual bias issues (although I doubt that was the intent).<br /><br />  I confess I still use this book often since my kids simply love the food, from Peanut Butter Pudding to Mulligan Stew to Fruit Basket Upset.	2005-02-22

In short, as the author himself describes it, this is a guide to the \\"art of verbal self-defense\\". Designed for everyone who figures out what they SHOULD have said only AFTER a painful confrontation is long over, this book preps the reader so that the next time around the balance may shift.<br /><br />  Some of the responses are admittedly mean, off-putting or sarcastic - but then, if osmeone is equally offensive, perhaps a dose of the same medicine isn't always a bad idea.<br /><br />  This is a classic.

And why not? Long work days, regimented schedules for our kids, unrealistic expectations and more have done much to take the joy out of parenting and to create the \\"perfect madness\\" that is the theme of this book.<br /><br />  Warner cites everything from pop culture to economic theory and she trusts that her readers will stay the course and make sense of it all, in spite of the detail...because it matters to us as parents to do so, to understand the forces that got us here and, ultimately, to question them.<br /><br />  One point she makes is that we didn't just get here accidentally. There were very real cultural and economic forces that fueled the direction we've gone. Reading about this is very enlightening and informative, especially since the author throws in her personal perspective and struggles as well. The latter adds a special tone to the book, one which makes it far more accessible than it might otherwise be.<br /><br />  In the process, she somehow manages to raise serious questions about going along with all the \\"shoulds\\", \\"oughts\\" and unrealistic expectations in our lives and perhaps begin to put some common sense back into family policy.<br /><br />  For the most part, she doesn't give definitive answers ((a valid criticism raised by other readers) but she does at least point out that things simply aren't working - parents are overstressed, children's lives are overly regimented and, in the process, the joy of parenting is being thrown by the wayside. Perhaps she doesn't give answers becasue she is still struggling with this issue herself, a good enough reason (IMO) to steer clear of absolutes.<br /><br />  I hope this book fuels many discussions and debates and helps change economic and social policy so that mothers get some much-needed breaks, whether economically or in other ways that make the balance of work, home, marriage and parenting less stressful and more do-able. Thank goodness this author has jumped into the fray -  with some heavy emphasis on areas that should be of major concern to ALL of us, mothers or not.tes.  <br />   I hope this book fuels many discussions and debates and helps change economic and social policy so that mothers get some much-needed breaks, whether economically or in other ways that make the balance of work, home, marriage and parenting less stressful and more do-able.

There..I said it. Don't like the format, don't like the criticisms, don't like watching poor souls squirm in embarassment as their fashion faux pas are brought to light.<br /><br />But I bought this book anyway and here is why: I watched an Oprah Show where the authors were promo-ing this book. They brought out REAL women, including one very obese woman, and showed them in their usual clothes, as awful as you can imagine, and then... showed them in outfits that truly worked for their particular bodies. The transformations were truly amazing and even the obese woman looked gorgeous and sexy. My jaw dropped. I was sold, just like that.<br /><br />  Happily, the book has lived up to my expectations. As I'd hoped, it is aimed at those of us who have problem areas like large hips or flabby thighs. The authors know their stuff and their advice is dead on, proving the there is hope for the fashion challenged and those who've just given up on ever looking presentable for even an hour, let alone a whole day.<br /><br />  They still won't win any votes from me for the format and tone of their tv show but when it comes to writing a solid book with plenty of good, practical and very useful info, they win hands down!

How does a child have a normal childhood when it is spent traveling from England to Germany and other locales, all because of a parent's search for  truth and enlightenment?<br />  If Guest's memoir is any indication, the children of such parents may well be left feeling dazed, confused and neglected. In Guest's case, his  mother spent much of her time involved in such activities as ecstatic dancing, group sex and bizarre rituals, some involving violence and even abuse. She wore bright clothing in the colors of the sunset.<br />  In all fairness, his mother was not aware of the darkness at the heart of the Rajneesh movement and when charges of embezzlement and even a possible plan to commit murder came to light, she had a change of heart and began to examine all her earlier assumptions. In her own way, she was nearly as naive, trusting and innocent as a child...although I can't help feeling she should have known better and been there for her son as a parent first, with her spiritual adventures coming second.<br />  I was happy to read that she did eventually make peace with her son and come to realize the harm she'd done to him, however inadvertently.	2005-02-16

Making the adjustment to low carb has meant learning a whole new way to cook. Before I discovered this book, other recipes I've tried have been bland or required too much prep time.<br />  Not this one. From the very first page, I was able to hit the ground running, since the book comes compete with WEEKLY shopping lists and recipes that take a short time to throw together but taste like they've taken all day to cook. We enjoyed Cube steaks with onion gravy, Thai Shrimp, Skillet Chicken Mediterranean and more.<br />  Don't be scared by the \\"exotic\\" sounds of some of the recipes. This is family cooking, NOT something that you could only eat if you had the most refined of palates. If your kids aren't fish lovers, you might want to keep some simple alternatives on hand but on most nights, they should be able to eat the same menu as the \\"Low carbers\\".<br />  ONE caveat - Some of the recipes are designed for a crockpot. I don't have one and I found it simple to adjust the cooking times. It was no big deal. But do keep in mind that at least one recipe a week is designed for a crockpot. Again, this wasn't a big deal to me, even without one.<br />  In every other way, the book is perfect for our needs and we've branched out into newer, better recipes than before. Thanks, Leanne!	2005-02-11

Find an extra ten dollars a day, apply it to your credit card debt, DON'T CHARGE ANY MORE on those cards and in 3 years you'll have paid off a huge chunk of debt....maybe even all of it.<br />  That is the basic info in this book and it simply isn't reason enough to buy it. Like dieters who lost 10 or 20 pounds and then gain it back, those who are in debt are likely to fall back into debt again - unless they change their way of thinking bigtime.<br />  That is why credit card companies love those customers who are paying 10, 12, even 17 percent interest. They might pay it down but odds are they'll also rack up the debt again. Plenty of credit card companies even INCREASE the credit limit for these folks. Why not? From their point of view, it may be quite profitable.<br />  Finally, there is another problem that ISN'T addressed by this book - and that is the belief that there is an extra $10.00 a day to be found in the average budget. Truth is, some people are paying for the necessities of life with credit cards - food, home, medical bills. For them, not only is there no extra money to be found, there is not a single area in the bduget that can be cut. An extra job, better health insurance or some other type of solution might help them but until that comes along they aren't likely to shuck the credit card habit. And they certainly shouldn't spend their hard earned money on this book.<br />  For the average person, buying this book won't hurt a thing...but it won't solve your problems, either, unless you are willing to take a good hard look at your spending patterns and make some PERMANENT changes - stop charging, get an extra job, don't buy a thing that isn't necessary. For those willing to examine every purchase in the light of a new, more spartan outlook, change is possible. But will this book be the only guide you need? Don't think so. Meeting with a good financial counselor on a regular basis (think of this person as \\" a personal trainer \\" for your financial life)could bring about more longterm results.g about more longterm results.	2005-02-08

Not the "Same old, thing" yet again	Ever read a garden book and feel like it contains tons of recycled information - like one of those notorious fruitcakes that goes from home to home every Christmas?<br />  This time around, the author dares to express some rather unique, even radical, viewpoints about garden design and color combinations. If you're a traditionalist, you might be a bit intimidated by some of the suggestions but this is an opportunity to let your gardening creativity take root (pun intended). Perhaps you'll discvoer, as I did, that certain plants just \\"click\\" togehter,even though their colors seem unharmonious at first glance.<br />  If you follow DiSabato-Aust's guideline, you may well have the most beautiful garden on the block and find yourself falling in love with your yard again.  There are lists of plants, suggested placement in relation to other plants and plenty of information about growing requirements. But it is the originality of this one that sets it apart.

I wish I'd had a book like this around when I was an expectant parent. I'd have read it cover to cover, many times over (which I did, anyway, even though my youngest is now a teenager). That is simply how good this book is.<br /><br />  What makes it a standout:<br /><br />1. It has sections on EVERY stage of pregnancy, from the very first days to the final trimester. As soon as that pregnancy test comes back positive, an expectant parent could use the detailed list in the first chapters to find the right doctor and hospital, as well as learn what separates one hospital from another. This helps maximize the chances of a good fit in all areas - parent, doctor and hospital.<br /><br />2. There are case studies based on actual patients along with  lively comments from the co-author, herself a mother of five. The combined medical and parental perspectives are a delight to read.<br /><br />3. The book was co-authored by both a doctor and a parent. One author is a doctor who has delivered over a thousand babies, the other a publisher who is the mother of five children herself. As a result, there is plenty of medical detail combined with down to earth questions and answers, information that anyone can read and understand.<br /><br />4. First-time parents will be prepared for the physcial and emotional changes that occur in each trimester of pregnancy, from morning sickness to mood swings . Reading this section made me realize yet again how much I could have benefited from this book (and how I could have saved my obstetrician from many a panicky phone call). There is much reassurance here for the first time expectant parent - and even experienced expectant parents may learn something new (I certainly did).<br /><br />5. All the practical matters are covered, from finding great maternity clothes to dealing with work.<br /><br />6. Finally, the glossary at the back of the book will keep you from shaking your head and muttering, \\"Uh-huh...\\" with a glassy stare when your doc starts throwing around medical terms like 'Rhogham' or 'Pfannestiel skin incision'.<br /><br />In short, you can't do better than this one. Highly recommended!r 'Pfannestiel skin incision'.     In short, you can't do better than this one. Highly recommended!	2005-02-06

Even if you don't enjoy cooking all that much, you will absolutely LOVE this book because of the detailed accounts of each recipe's beginnings and the special events and people behind them. The recipes aren't anything to sneeze at, either - not fancy or \\"gourmet\\" but good, tasty home cooking with some special touches from Angelou that set them apart from the average. Caramel lovers will have a field day here since there are a number of recipes, such as caramel cake, that have caramel as a main ingredient.<br /><br />  What makes this book REALLY special are the stories that Maya Angelou tells about how and when she discovered certain recipes, memories of family togetherness or of affairs gone terribly wrong (the latter inspired her to go home and create a wonderful banana pudding). Her Smothered Chicken won raves from Oprah Winfrey and was featured on a recent show.<br /><br />  As always, Angelou is opinionated and straightforward about what she likes in a recipe and what makes for good cooking - and eating. Readers are likely to learn something along the way, not only about what makes for good eating but what being a gracious, generous host is all about.	2005-01-27

I started reading this one while in the bathtub and I DID NOT get out until I'd gotten to the final page, even though I had to keep adding hot water to the tub when it grew tepid and my toes became so wrinkled that I could hardly bear to look at them when I finally stood up again.<br /><br />  This is a romance novel but it is also far more, suspenseful and funny as well. Basic plot - Young woman goes to check on her elderly neighbor, only to find her unconscious and bloody, face down on her floor. Young woman, having a heart of gold, steps in to take care of her neighbor's pets. Meanwhile, the neighbor's nephew, handsome but coldhearted, is off on a romantic fling and enlists the help of a buddy to take his place. This, of course, includes masquerading as the nephew.<br /><br />  Misunderstandings ensue, of course, along with romance....all under false pretenses (young woman knows nothing of the truth). The whole tale is told, charmingly, through a series of emails. I absolutely could NOT put down this book until the final delicious page.<br /><br />  Having said that, some of it is a bit predictable and a few stereotypes abound (brainless models, for instance). But, all in all, this is a fun read and far superior to most in the field. I confess I loved every single page of the book.	2005-01-16

Although I do have a tax specialist look over my paperwork every year, I use this book as backup and have even found a few things over the years (admittedly, very few) that my preparer missed. I feel good just knowing that I'm on top of things.<br /><br />  If you prepare your taxes yourself, here are some of the features you'll LOVE in this edition:<br /><br /> Easy to understand filing tips and instructions. Whether you are a first-time taxpayer or an experienced one, you'll be as prepared as possible if you use this book.<br /><br />  There are updates, planning reminders and strategies to maximize your savings this year - and help you plan for the next tax year.<br /><br />I especially like the \\"Alerts\\" about upcoming laws and possible changes. Nothing like being prepared!<br /><br />Recent IRS changes and rulings are alos noted, another valuable bit of info.<br /><br />If you tend to miss things, the CAUTION notices in the book will alert you to possible errors as well as areas you might miss.<br /><br />There are also spaces for you to write, take notes, etc...as you read, a very nice feature.	2005-01-15

This book is for all those people, the ones who wonder \\"What if?\\"<br /><br />  Written by Donna Hanover, a woman who reconnnected (and married) her high school sweetheart 30 years after their breakup, this book contains not only her tale but the true experiences of dozens of other couples who reunited after spending years apart, couples who are building new lives together, complete with a special photo section. It makes for fascinating reading, whether you are married or single, in a relationship or just hoping to reconnect with that \\"special someone\\" from way back when.<br /><br />  But this is more than just a mere recounting of anecdotes, romantic fantasies and realities. Hanover also provides information about how rekindled love is different from a completely new relationship - and she offers helpful tips for those who might actually want to find a former boyfriend or girlfriend, including tips on using the Internet.	2005-01-14

Bypass any feelings you may have about the title. This isn't an attack on Christianity, folks, but one guy's take on life, touching on such topics as how words evolved over time, the language of football compared to baseball and other intriguing aspects of our culture.<br /><br />  Carlin knows we're all a little nuts (or would it be better to say we're \\"quirky\\" or \\"eccentric\\")? His genius is exposing our peculiarities, forcing us to think about the oddities in the world, especially when it comes to human reasoning and logic.<br /><br />  So why all the controversy over this book? Is it just the title? Looking at the world from Carlin's perspective, even if it is just for an afternoon or two, doesn't have to be threatening...and you don't have to stick around for the ride if you get too uncomfortable.	2005-01-02

Instead of sticking out like a sore thumb (her parents were not only liberal but their idea of a vacation was a week at a Socialist retreat), she yearned only to be \\"like everyone else\\", even if that meant living a conventional, even bland, lifestyle. Her dreams were those of typical little girls of the time - to become a ballerina or, perhaps (with luck and the right breaks) a movie star.<br /><br />  But if she HAD lived a more conventional life, I doubt Gilman would ever had turned out a book so funny, so unique and...well, written from an outsider's perspective. Gilman realizes some of her dreams and drops some along the way. She writes about sex, love, work and that elusive \\"pouffy white dress\\" in a vivid, endearing style.  By the time you reach the end of the book, you'll be yearning for more from this writer.	2005-01-02

But you can find better. Most of these rooms have a fireplace as focal point. Don't have a fireplace/ You'll find only parts of the book useful.<br />  Another BIG MINUS - the lack of color pictures. Color is an important design element and one bright chair can throw off an otherwise \\"balanced\\" room. Using color appropriately, whether to support a traditional design scheme or to inject an element of surprise or whimsy is a basic decorating principle.<br />  Finally, many of the rooms are already quite dated. Sure, you'll get a nicer look if you follow the tips in the book. What you WON'T get is a room that seems in style - today. If you're a traditionalist, that may not matter - but I found some of the traditional rooms seemed out of style too (were they faux traditonal or something?).<br />  Having said all this, there are some basic design principles that you may find quite useful.

In the meantime, I read lots of books, year in and out, plenty of them good, some of them even great. But none were like this one, which gave me a whole new way of looking at the world and life's possibilities. Instead of a nod of recognition and a reflection of the world as it is, each story gave me a sense of \\"What if?\\" and a view of unseen parts of the human psyche.<br /><br />  Some of these stories (The Spray, Access Fantasy) are pure fantasy but within that fantasy is more than a grain of truth about how we see ourselves, yearning for meaning, communion or just to reach beyond common sense and \\"reality\\"  and into the realm of true weirdness. Lehman has a way of taking the reader there while keeping his stories somehow believable, within the bounds of their unique worlds.<br /><br />  It is a pleasure to read a writer willing to take risks like this and to do so without pretension or pose. Loved this book!	2004-12-17

She not only drops the names of celebrities she's dated, everyone from Stallone to Nicholson, but she spills her guts about her own flaws (the only time she loses perspective because she is far less flawed than she thinks; her worst enemy is truly herself). SHe's also honest about the best and worst parts of the dating world and the photo spreads are an added bonus.<br /><br />  If you know someone who is a celebrity watcher but not a great reader, this would make an excellent gift along with Dickinson's first book, No Lifeguard on Duty. I guarantee they won't be able to put these books down.<br /><br />  Take either of these books, pour yourself a glass of wine and sink into a hot bath (maybe with some candles nearby to set the mood) and you're set for a juicy read and guaranteed escape from reality for a few hours.

You may find, as I did, that some of the recipes just don't taste all that great. Most are bland, at best. However, you can doctor them very easily, IF you have some experience as a cook and know how to do this. Beginning cooks may be lost.<br /><br />  Some of the recipes were just plain inedible and one, a lentil/rice stew, required far more water than the recipe specified...PLUS I had to keep watching the pot since the lentils kept sticking to the bottom.

I bought mine years ago and it is still one of the most-used books I have. Here's why:<br />1. Shopping lists that are easy to use and family friendly. Weekly menus and tips for saving even more.<br />2. Healthy foods, plenty of fruits and veggies but nothing exotic that kids won't touch<br />3. Good, basic recipes, including a GREAT, kid-friendly stir-fry recipe, excellent (and usually healthy) desserts, plenty of main meals. I LOVED the baked pudding, using milk, eggs, vanilla, etc. Easy and healthy!<br />4.Lots of the main courses can be doubled or tripled and frozen, so you don't have to shop as often.<br />5. A realistic plan. Although you may not want to, the author serves dessert every night. If you cut that to 3 times a week or so, you'd save even more money. Also, Barfield (author) isn't perfect and doesn't expect the reader to be, either. She admits to eating out once in a while, etc. Even so, the savings are impressive...and, of course, eating out doesn't mean expensive restaurants but more like the nearest Taco Bell or something.	2004-12-02

Why this book is a must-have	If you're as busy as I am, you don't have time to read a long review, so I'll keep this one short and focus on the reasons why you really need to have this one on hand:<br /><br />1. The menus are family friendly, healthy and economical. There is a balance between vegetarian and maat-based recipes, reducing dependence on meat and reducing the costs for food. From Turkey Meat Loaf (the FIRST turkey meat loaf I ever liked) to Pea Soup, the recipes are tasty, kid friendly and yet sophisticated enough for adult palates.<br /><br />2. There  is a shopping list for EACH week, making trips to the grocery store quick and easy. Fresh ingredients are used and there are no recipes using foods with artificial preservatives, chemicals or artifical dyes.<br /><br />3. The menus are arranged by season, which means you aren't going to waste money on a lot of items that are out of season or costly.<br /><br />4. The author has helpful tips on nearly every page and even though I've been cooking for our family for years, I learned plenty of new info. That, in itself, made the book valuable to me since I now prepare even more nutritious meals for my family and I shop more wisely as well.<br /><br />5. All the recipes are easy to prepare and fit into busy schedules. That's a definite plus!	2004-10-28

Here's why:<br /><br />1. The author gives detailed worksheets for all sorts of extra costs associated with working, from the expected (taxes, work clothes) to the unexpected (extra hosiery, meals outside the home, guilt costs)<br /><br />2 Real life examples are given, showing the real benefits (or lack of them) from an extra income. If one person earns $50,000, for example, and another earns $20,000, the extra income can well be eaten up with extra taxes, child care, reduced time (making it more likely that someone will have to be paid for housework or other chores) and more.<br /><br />3. Proof is povided that indicates that an extra working parent can actually put families in an economic hole - or deepen the one they're in.<br /><br />The author has worked outside the home and went back to work when her kids got older. This book is not a diatribe against working moms but a detailed examination of the realities of having that extra job. Clear, logical and well-written, this one is a must-have for anyone considering work outside the home. If you don't have kids, this book may not appeal to you, since most of the examples do relate to working parents, not childless couples.	2004-10-25

This novel starts out at a deceptively languid pace and then rivets the tension up in an instant. Michael Dillon, an average hotel manager, is planning to ask his wife for a divorce. On the same evening, his life is turned upside down when two men burst into his home and hold his wife at gunpoint, asking him to carry a car loaded with a bomb to a specific destination - that or his wife will be killed.<br /><br />  If you think the plot sounds formulaic, think again. It veers off in all sorts of unpredictable directions as Dillon's private life suddenly becomes very public, his wife turns out to be far nobler than anyone might expect, etc.<br /><br />  Think about what sort of choices YOU might make if the eyes of the world were suddenly turned your way and every move you made was dissected and analyzed under a public microscope. Fascinating look at Irish politics and the tension between public and personal loyalties.	2004-10-21

This is the stuff of good fiction, plain and simple.	2004-10-12

In doing so, he stretches credulity, finally to the breaking point.<br /><br />  The United States had (and still has) its share of racial and religious prejudices but to equate Lindbergh and Hitler was a stretch I just couldn't make. Tis time around, I felt Roth missed the mark, but I applaud his effort.	2004-10-08

Small Spaces: Decorating to Make Every Inch Count	Books	3	13	22	N	N	Over the top decorating - and not in a good way	Christopher Lowell comes so close to getting it right but unfortunately doesn't seem to know when enough is enough, not just over the top. He uses the word \\"merchandising\\" a lot and...well...his rooms often look like department store displays, so filled with things that it is hard to imagine living (let alone breathing) in those rooms. Subtract half of what he puts in the average room and you'd have a decent space. But, please, Christopher, stop before it gets tacky. A living room is not a window display in a shopping mall.	2004-10-02

Not being a resident of New York, I wanted some details, especially from a personal perspective.<br /><br /> Instead, this book sidetracks all over the place. There are some brief glimpses into Spiegelman's reaction to the towers falling, his desperate rush to school to get his daughter and his fears afterwards. But these glimpses are brief indeed and far more of the book contains takeoffs on other comics, often confusing ones. He seems to be trying to paste together a montage of information, much of it surreal or only vaguely touching on Sept 11.<br /><br /> Having read Spiegleman's wonderful book Maus, I expected more, something with more heart and soul. This wasn't it. Not only that but the pages are heavy cardboard stock, thick, the kind you'd find in children's board books and so there are relatively few pages. Not much substance for the relatively high price. I wouldn't buy it again, ekther for personal use or for a gift.	2004-09-08

I chanced upon it when it appeared on my son's required reading for a course..and wow, am I glad I did! It should be a classic, have no idea why it isn't, if only for the detail and insight about church politics and the workings of congregations in the 1800s.<br /><br />  This gem of a novel focuses on Theron Ware, a Methodist minister who has had a less than stellar career, which leads to his current posting in a small, backcountry town. He vows to make a new start and, for a time, things seem to go well. But alas, Theron is less certain than he appears, making him easy prey to those with questionable values and setting him on a parth towards destruction. For the first time in his life, Theron questions his calling, his values and even his marriage.<br /><br />  I couldn't wait to see how this one would end..and I won't give the ending away here. I'll just say that if you pick up this one, you won't be disaapointed.	2004-09-07

Medical decisions are NOT what they used to be and patients need to be informed in order to make the right decision.<br /><br />2. The book outlines the six major steps necessary to make the right decision - from identifying your options to interpreting numbers, etc<br /><br />3. This book includes a guide to the right reference books and tips on reading and interpreting relevant medical articles, newsletters, television and even advertisements.<br /><br />4. It includes a guide to the internet as well as suggested Web sites. There are also helpful tips for navigating PubMed and other medical websites.<br /><br />5. Included are valuable strategies for finding the right medical information and interpreting the often confusing numbers and percentages included in medical tests and other medical procedures.<br /><br />6. Finally, this book looks at ALL the various aspects of medical treatment, from medical insurance to managing doctors.<br /><br />I've never seen another book like it and think it'd be invaluable for any patient - or family of one.	2004-08-28

There were long passages about decorating an old mansion and the romantic sections never seemed wholly believable to me. Too bad, because this author's best is worth reading...just not this time around.	2004-08-22

It seems to be primarily aimsed at business people. I wouldn't recommend it for those who want to improve family relationships.<br /><br />  Other points: if you're looing for a detailed guide for dealing with difficult people in a wide variety of possible situations, this isn't a book I'd recommend. The focus is on identifying the ten most annoying people (whiners, know-it-alls, snipers, etc) along with some limited suggestions for maximizng positive communication. It is basically up to the reader to figure out how to do that in specific situations, althnougb a few examples are given throughout the book.<br /><br />  This isn't a terrible book but it is an introductory guide at best. There are better choices out there.	2004-08-20

I'm not a huge fan of the serial killer/thriller genre but this one transcends the usual formulas..and by a long shot. Imagine, if you can, rooting for a guy who is a serial killer . To top it off, he's got the perfect cover, working as a blood-splatter analyst for the Miami police department. Things are going well until another, equally competent, serial killer appears in Miami, threatening to throw Dexter off his game.<br /><br /> I'm amazed at how well Jeff Lindsay portrays Dexter, a guy who sees himself as emotionless, but comes across as an almost soulful guy. He's witty, generally polite, good-looking..the perfect guy, except for one obvious character flaw. Add suspense and some unpredictable twists to the tale and you've got a winner. This could have been a gimmicky book but Lindsay doesn't take the easy road and readers who stick with this one will be in for a special experience.<br /><br />Note to Author: Give me a heads up when your next one comes out.	2004-08-09

Within a very short time, using this book, his math skills were on a par with the other students and he felt confident about his ability to understand the concepts.<br /><br />  At least half the book is devoted to review of basic math concepts like adding mixed numbers, mixed number subtraction , decimal parts of a number and so on. Only in the later lessons are actual algebraic equations and concepts fully explained. I felt this was a good thing, giving the student a solid base to work with but I could see how more advanced math students might feel bored or impatient with the lengthy review sections.<br /><br />  This book does explain every single concept carefully and with simplified language which optimizes a student's ability to understand and use basic  math concepts.<br /><br />  In short, know your student before purchasing your book. But for the right student, this could be an ideal choice.	2004-08-03

From artificial insemination to euthanasia, all facets of medicine are explored, all with related Jewish references and guidelines. The author doesn't just investigate obvious issues such as abortion, suicide and how to treat terminally ill patients but also looks at more obscure areas  - unconventional therapies, dental emergencies on the Sabath and whether marijuana is ethical in medical treatments (again, from a Jewish perspective). I guarantee you'll learn something new if you read this one!	2004-07-18

The Lightwedge book light is the FIRST one that not only keeps his side of the bed nice and dark but illuminates the pages of my books without any harsh glare. It actually looks as though the book pages are lighting themselves, with a nice, even glow and NO distracting overly bright areas.<br />  I'm giving these as holiday gifts to all the readers I know.

But take a 30 year marriage, complete with kids and then consider that your husband has been cheating - and not once, but repeatedly, including one long-term affair, lasting years. Think you'd walk right out the door (or boot him out?)<br />  Read this book and you might reconsider your position, as Farbman reveals, in heartbreaking detail, what she went through and how she came out the other side. She doesn't hold anything back, from the first inklings of suspicion to the wrenching certainty that her husband had cheated on her. It is a soul-searing account of a hellish time, but one that is impossible to put down.	2004-05-19

Whether you want to know how how to create a focal point in a room, group your objects attractively on shelves or hang your pictures for maximum impact, this book provides all the info you need for success.<br />  There are also diagrams and photos for those who prefer pictures to print and much of the information, such as &quot;Arthur's Magic Triangle&quot; (a surefire formula for arranging objects of different sizes) can be used in any room, from kitchen to bedroom. He also has tips arranged by type of room.<br />  Once I got this one, I got rid of tons of my other books. Why keep them? This was the only one I really needed.	2004-04-18

But consider the fact that people are saving less than ever before (or so say many financial planners and news reports) this book could serve as a wake-up call to those who need it most and make them re-evaluate their spending habits. As some critics of this book say, much of the material here may seem &quot;obvious&quot;. If thats so, then why aren't more people doing the obvious - cutting back on impulse purchases, avoiding significant credit card debt and failing to plan for the future?<br />  With strong examples and accessible charts, I have to give Bach credit for writing a book which could get people to become conscious, TRULY conscious, of how even small purchases can add up to big losses of capital over time,perhaps even motivating them to make better choices and  maximizing savings as the years go by.<br />  Bach shows how eliminating that daily cup of coffee at Starbucks or the impulse purchases at the shopping mall could end up savings thousands of dollars over the years. He urges readers to keep track of their purchases for a week or two and determine what is truly necessary or desired while cutting down on the rest. Not bad advice, even if its been said before.<br />  Will people who follows his tips automatically retire with plenty of money? Not necessarily. But they could end up with far more than they would otherwise. Considering the fact that people are saving less than before (as a general rule) this book could serve as a wake-up call to those who need it most and make them re-evaluate their spending habits. True, it may not offer much for financial whizzes but could certainly  be worthwile for others. In fact, I'm using some of the examples to teach my kids about basic spending and sqvings with noticably positive results.	2004-02-06

How I wish I'd read this book before I had my first credit card. This cautionary tale, all of it true, could have saved me a bundle. I'd give this to any young adult who needs a crash course on the dangers of credit card debt.<br />Karyn Bosnak is a young woman who has gotten into debt due to a penchant for the finer things in life - expensive clothes, cuisine and more.  When her debt rises into the thousands, she decides to bare all and opens a website at [...] She is honest and doesn't deny her problem or make excuses - although she does ask sympathetic visitors to help pay off her debt by offering donations or bidding on her castoffs on Ebay.<br /> In return, she keeps a running account of her expenses and savings, including her new, thrifty ways (many of which she learns from readers who write to her). She gets letters which range from hostile (&quot;How could you be so stupid?&quot;) to enouraging &quot;(I'm rooting for you!&quot;) which she shares with readers at her website. Amazingly, this scheme works and Karyn not only pulls herself out of debt but makes the national news. Ethics aside, gotta give her credit for having thought of a creative way to pull herself out of a hole.<br /><br />I confess to having visited the site many times and found it so enjoyable that I just HAD to get this book. It was a fun read, full of humor, insight and charm. More importantly, if Karyn's experiences could save someone else from following in her footsteps.	2004-01-22

History-Making 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup!	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A MUST-READ, dynamic account from a 12 year old soccer fan	From the moment I got this book, I was entranced, riveted by Leah Lauber's personal account as a reporter covering the  U.S. Women's National Soccer Team for the St. Petersburg (FL) Times. I felt like I was there, so well-written was her recreation of the events - from the first moments when the Team prepared for the 1999 Women's World Cup - to the final winning game. The full-color photos (200 plus) add to the charm of this book, with plenty of photos of such soccer stars as Mia Hamm and others.<br />  While I'd recommend this book to just about anyone as a great read, it is an especially good choice for soccer fans of all ages.  Right now, I'm re-reading it with a young soccer player and he is just as riveted as I was by this book.<br /> It'd also be an inspiring book for any youngster who wants motivation to reach for the stars and follow a goal..who knows, you could end up like Leah, making a book and inspiring others!  Highly recommended.	2004-01-06

Even so, I usually can't put down a Kaminsky novel until the very last page.<br /> This time around,  Lew Fonseca, a detective who's appeared in other Kaminsky novels, is trying to find out what happened to a young runaway named Adele. She is somehow connected to a very solitary and eccentric bestselling author and the loss of some valuable manuscripts.<br /> The mystery in this one will certainly hold your interest but equally compelling is Kaminsky's style. His books are lean and taut, with no wasted words or &quot;padding&quot; to lessen the drama and suspense...yet somehow he manages to create complex, believable characters and compelling mysteries as well. I'm always amazed at how well he pulls it off, book after book. With books costing as much as they do (the paperback edition of this one set me back 6.99) you might as well spend your money on a book written by a writer who is this good. Then, of course, you're going to want to buy more of his books...but trust me, it'll be worth it.	2003-10-12

I've always enjoyed reading Gaffney's books but this one is her best yet..full of quirky, yet endearing women, each faced with a unique challenge - illness, infertility, marital troubles,etc. Luckily, there is plenty of humor and charm as well.<br />I don't want to give too much away here but female readers will definitely relate to the women here, root for them and be touched by their struggles.

Jean is an executive on the fast track, with a biting wit and hardened, calculating side. Sunny is a mother, wife and wonderful friend to those who know her. And Bridget...is the ethereal spirit who doesn't quite seem grounded in reality.<br />  Although the book's title makes it seem as though it would focus on a baby, this isn't the case. I was absolutely riveted by this novel, which isn't so much about a baby (The Crossley Baby in the book's title) but about the various ways in which family members relate to one another and how an unexpected turn of events affect their connections, for better or worse.<br /> Beautifully well-written, with the humor, detail and depth of a classic, this is a book to be savored. While updated for today's readers, it reminded me of Jane Austin novels, creating a whole world for the reader to inhabit, complete with people that seem to jump from the pages, eccentricities and all.	2003-09-12

Take the Cauliflower with Cumin sauce, for example - it takea less than 10 minutea and can be served hot or at room temperature (we even like it cold).<br />  The sauce section of this book is a major plus, since you can simply makes most of these ahead of time and then keep them in the fridge till needed, a simple way to spice up everyday meals with a unique sauce. We've used the Basil-Pesto sauce on chicken and fish, impressed guests when we served beef with Walnut and Blue Cheese Butter and jazzed up green beans or broccoli with the Cilantro Butter.<br />  We've used and re-used this one many times, even though we've had it less than 2 weeks!	2003-08-02

Originally published in the 1800s, it has stood the test of time and is still considered among the best works out there on the subject. Sections include such subjects as: Who may be present at childbirth, how to prevent the &quot;evil eye&quot; being turned on children...how to find out a &quot;fairy changeling&quot;...marriage traditions...animal and plant superstitions...and more.	2003-07-14

Here's the major pluses of this book, one worth adding to a bookshelf on New Mexican style:<br />1. Photos of authentic architectural details, many of them now gone or extinct, making this a valuable resource - and one that should be even more valuable in years to come.<br />2. An opportunity to see the interiors of several old and historic Santa Fe homes, with close-ups of such details as the fireplaces, tin and iron fixtures , doors, gates, window treatments, corbels, etc.<br />3. Historical information which provides added insight and perspective<br />  All of the above is more than enough to warrant a place on my bookshelf. Now, a few words about what this book is NOT: if you are looking for architectural layouts of homes, complete with specs, etc...this book is not what you want. But if you want a close look at the fine details that can make or break authentic New Mexican style- details such as Corbels, Portal Posts, Doors, Windows, alacenas, Railings, gates and mailboxes- this would be a wonderful addition to your library.	2003-06-08

I can't remember the last time I had so much fun reading a novel that purports to be a comedy of manners but is also a heartwarming look at the eccentricities found in families and of the ties that bond those families together - in spite of themselves. Filled with humor and warmth, this one is an absolute stand-out, not to be missed.<br />  At the heart of this book is Gabriel Gibbs, a young boy struggling to find himself after being thrown out of an upscale boarding school. Luckily he has his wise, if unconventional, brother Spencer to look after him as well as a muse in the form of the mysterious Lillian Dawes, a woman who is both more and less than she seems. She touches the heart of both Gabriel and his brother, leading them towards an unpredictable conclusion.	2003-06-05

This book truly lives up to its name &quot;Family Entertaining&quot; - which means, in short, that it is full of wonderful recipes perfect for friends and family. I bought it just before my son's graduation party because I wanted a cookbook with recipes teens would eat but tasty for adults as well. I couldn't have picked a better book for the task. Adults raved about the  Wild Mushroom Risotto while the teens loved the Barbequed Chicken and Best Baked Beans.<br /> Later in the year I used it to plan a more upscale dinner with  a Mustard-Glazed Salmon,  Caesar Salad with Homemade Croutons, Pasta with Broccoli and, for dessert, a choice of Raspberry-Pear Cobbler or Killer Brownies (some adventurous souls had both).<br /> Best of all, the recipes are a cinch to fix, yet impressive enough to serve company.

I'm not giving anything away by noting that Joan Castleman, the narrator of this story, decides to leave her husband - this detail is revealed in the first chapter of the book, very early on. From there, she goes back and forth between describing the past (how she met her husband, his literary career, etc) and the present. It is the ending that seems so unbelievable to me and a throwback to earlier types of fiction, where women sacrifice themselves for love. A tale of two deeply dysfunctional people, in a marriage that lasted far too long, not particularly enlightening or engaging to read about.	2003-05-21

Instead, this ingenious thriller has several mysteries to keep the reader guessing...and that makes for a totally engrossing book.<br /> First off, there's a software company (MonkeeWrench) run by a group of people who happen to be designing a new, very graphic computer game, Serial Killer Detective..which happens to showcase photos of \\"murders\\" which, while fake, are staged very realistically by the MonkeeWrench staff.<br />  When  a sample of the game, complete with photos, is offered on the Web - in an attempt to pre-sell the game to the public - a murderer goes beyond staged murders - to the real thing.<br />  To add to the suspense, each of the people behind MonkeeWrench have new identities, ones they created years ago...for reasons which become clear only later on,leaving the reader to wonder what past event precipitated the need for new identities - and could this somehow be tied to the recent rash of  murders?<br />  An original plot makes this a good read and the authors prove their mettle even further by creating a great set of eccentric characters, keeping the pace tight and adding enough twists and turns to keep readers guessing about the outcome. One worth adding to the top of a summer reading list!	2003-05-01

From the cheery, saucy yellow of nasturtiums set against a pale yellow wall to the hanging herb gardens set outside a kitchen window to the gentle pinks of trailing rose petunias...all of these baskets are appealing.

The focus of this set are 25 plays with such themes as: The First Christmas...John the Baptist...Pentecost...The Paralyzed Man..and more. What makes this set unique, however, are the activities and the engaging scripts - which allow students to think about life as it was lived in Jesus's time, while adding interest and variety to classroom activities. Teachers will find the background information, synopsis of each play, the faith messages and activities cards to be quite helpful. For those who want to branch out even more, there are suggestions for art projects, poems and songs. A wonderfully multi-dimensional way of bringing Scripture alive!	2003-04-23

In short, those of us who find it difficult to keep our homes decluttered may need to look within ourselves first.<br />  But don't assume this book is just about spiritual matters or that it omits the how-tos of housecleaning. The author also includes valuable tips such as &quot;Always vacuum and dust your windows when you clean your floor&quot; and even suggests you enlist helpers when tackling larger tasks. Finally, she urges readers to actually make sure they have time to just &quot;putter&quot; or do nothing - so that when they do get back to work, it is with a lightened, refreshed spirit.	2003-04-23

Instead, the author sets out to visit the small villages and town in Italy in an attempt to find the food artists who keep culinary traditions alive. I loved reating about such craftsmen as the ones who make Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, Italian chocolate and other delicacies. An extra bonus- a list of restaurants and Culinary Guides to Italy - for those who wish to meet the people described in the book or taste the foods themselves.	2003-04-19

With buildings ranging from the Nasrid palace to the Umayyad mosque at Cordoba the author reveals the history and aesthetic techniques used in Spanish and Portugese Oriental architecture. Anyone wanting a fuller appreciation or knowledge of this rich architectural legacy would do well to linger over this one. Chapters are arranged by historical period or movement (Christianity in the North...Confrontation and Reconquest...Revival and Transformation...etc). The photos deserve special mention. They were specially commissioned for this book and are so gorgeous that I have picked up the book again and again (even when I was too tired to read the text) just to enjoy looking at them.

I really liked that approach.<br /> This point was driven home early in the book where one homeowner showcases a collection of lunchboxes - not something that just anyone would collect - and, obviously, requiring an innovative use of wall space to highlight them.  In other, more traditional rooms, other storage ideas were suggested, along with floor plans to make the maximum use of space. There is a strong emphasis on form, function and aesthetics - in short, great ideas which also look good.	2003-04-11

But I've never found a quick minestrone or spaghetti sauce recipe which tastes as good as one that cooks slowly, letting the flavors &quot;marry&quot; and blend...and the recipes in this book fall short of my time-tested favorites.<br />  On the other hand, most of the recipes aren't bad and, if you're tired and hungry, odds are you'll find plenty to satisfy here. In fact,  the minestrone in this book (which does indeed take about 15 mintues to cook) is far superior to any canned or fast food soup I've had, containing a subtle blend of zucchini, plum tomatoes, kidney beans, Parmesan cheese and other fresh vegetables and spices. It smells and tastes yummy and is plenty satisfying - if not perfect (I admit it; I have high expectations). Ditto for the spaghetti sauces, desserts and salads. They're fine, just not superior.<br /> Most of the recipes in this book fall into the Gourmet or Exotic category, so steer clear of this one if you don't like to try unusual combinations or flavors (examples include Fettucine with Coriander &amp; Ginger and  Salad of Fig-Stuffed Chicken with Blue Cheese). Most kids wouldn't like the recipes here, unless they're budding gourmands. Who does that leave? Well, there's plenty here for the vegetarian who wants to expand his or her horizons, so this might be a good gift choice for veggie lovers on your list - as well as for more experimental cooks who are short on time.	2003-04-01

Amazingly, diverse treatments from far flung areas as Britain and France prove that they can blend with traditional American country styles. The 400 full-color photos in the book offer inspiration for those who prefer to get their ideas from pictures or demonstrations and there is also detailed information on how to achieve each style  - from wall treatments to furniture and accessories.	2003-03-31

Author John Nance clearly knows the world of aviation inside out, plus he has a knack for creating full-throttle suspense.  The situation: a plane full of disgruntled passengers, mistreated by airline personnel and pushed to the brink. Combine this with a forced emergency landing in Nigeria and airline mutiny is all but certain. This scenario makes for a riveting tale but Nance doesn't stop there...the rest I won't reveal but I urge you to read this one, far superior to most thrillers out there.	2003-03-29

But if you enjoy the creativity, fun and economical (compared to restaurant prices) results of making your own meals you'll love this book. Admittedly, some of the recipes and ingredients are a bit out of the ordinary (Tongue Salad, for instance) but others use ordinary ingredients to get extraordinary results (Polenta Soup, made nothing more unusual than cornmeal, spices, some broth, etc). And the desserts...ahhh...try the Creme Brulee with the unusual addition of Cognac..or the Coconut Cake with Caramel ...or the Pear Broche Bread Pudding....and savor the results.	2003-03-27

What makes this one worth having on the shelf of any vintage clothing collector/lover:<br />1. The depth and detail of the information makes this book a classic work of reference. THe author not only gives readers the information needed to help identify period fashions by time period but also has sections on the basics of collecting as well as the history of the great designers, couture fashion and vintage clothing. Added information, such as the winners of the Coty Fashion Awards through the years, give readers interesting details to supplement their knowledge and make informed decisions when purchasing these (often pricey) fashions...and to choose the ones that may be worth even more in years to come.<br />2. Pictures throughout, including a nice center pictorial section, with many of the pictures in full-color.<br />3. A supplementary section containing books and other resources for those who want even more information (although this book may be all they need).<br />4. Although it contains a wealth of information, the book is still compact enough to carry if you go to antique shows, estate sales or other sources for vintage clothes - a real plus if you need information quickly.<br />5. Arranged so that it is useful to both beginners and those who already know something about the area of collecting antique fashions.<br />6. Written from the perspective of someone who is both a collector and lover of vintage fashion... making the book thoroughly enjoyable to read.	2003-03-14

This book has gotten bashed because it doesn't come out and say that breastfeeding is a must - but it does reveal a diversity of opinions, some of them mixed, about breast feeding. I found it refreshing and a welcome change from the \\"Women MUST breastfeed\\" books out there, masquerading as \\"unbiased\\" but actually quite one-sided. Yes, I believe breastfeeding is a good thing for mother and child but this doesn't mean (as Ms. Blum reveals) that it is always a joy. Unfortunately, I'm afraid so many will bash this book that it won't get a fair chance at finding its readership - and that is too bad.	2003-02-05

First off, let me say that I use this book often and, for the most part, I absolutely LOVE it. The first recipe I tried, Sagaponack Corn Pudding, was truly different from other corn pudding recipes I'd tried, living up to Garten's promise that it would not be bland - and it wasn't - nor was it too spicy. It had some added flavor thanks to cheddar cheese and fresh basil but those with less experimental tastes could leave out the basil (as I did when we had small children at dinner one evening) and it would still be delicious.<br /> Another plus to this cookbook: Many of the recipes are not only family-friendly but easy to throw together. There are also plenty of dishes for vegetarians as well as meat eaters, making meal planning easy. Nearly every recipe I tried was wonderful, with the minor exception of the Chicken Noodle Soup (I prefer my recipe).<br /> Now the caveat: If you like extremely exotic or unusual foods, this may not be the ideal cookbook for you. While there ARE recipes which are new and different (like the Saffron Risotto with Butternut Squash or a truly different and yummy Espresso Ice cream, better than any I've had thus far), MOST of the recipes are updated versions of familiar favorites..Rice Pilaf, Hashed Browns, Fried Chicken, etc. Professional or gourmet cooks may want something more challenging.<br /> But I've had a hard time finding cookbooks which contain tasty  recipes I can serve, night after night, and still keep my family happy and well-fed while minimizing my kitchen time. For those purposes, this one fits the bill. And if you happen to have any guests drop in at meal time, you can bet they'll be happy too!	2003-02-04

So I bought a few cookbooks but this is the ONLY one that has recipes my whole family loves, so much so that we use it at least 3-5 times a week and never feel like we're eating the same thing.<br />  The recipes aren't just for rice but for all sorts of grains and vegetables and fruits as well. In fact, I'm ready to throw out my crockpot because the meals prepared in the rice cooker are much better, don't have that overcooked, stewed taste you can get with a crockpot and have all the convenience and ease that I need with my busy schedule. The directions are clear and the recipes range from the simple (plain cooked grains) to the more complex (rice with coconut and currants... or grits with cheese and spices )<br />  The ultimate test of a good cookbook, of course, is getting compliments and raves about the food. Every time I've made a recipe from this book, the food has been devoured quickly. We rarely have leftovers and my son's friends even make a point of looking in the kitchen to see if the rice cooker is turned on ( yes, the recipes in this cookbook are THAT good).	2002-11-21

Books	4	0	1	N	N	What to know before buying this one	This one absolutely DELIGHTED my young son BUT it scared the daylights out of his cousin...so I felt I needed to caution parents to be aware of your child's \\"fright level\\" before buying this book. Although nothing truly bad happens to anyone in this book, the main character is a very large and potentially frightening giant. Most children, including mine, loved the suspense of going \\"into\\" the giant's castle, tiptoeing past his giant mouse, cat, hen, etc...and finally arriving at the giant's bedroom, opening a flap and realizing that...the giant is awake!. My son squealed with glee at this part and begged me to read this story again and again. His cousin, however, had nightmares for days...so be aware of your child's sensitivities. For the right child, this can be a wonderful book.	2002-11-14

Equally delightul are her musings about living on a farm without electricity, cars or plumbing. Her writing is heartfelt, moving and, at times (when she wrote of her husband's death) even heartbreaking..but so honest that you can't help but be moved.<br /> As for the food and recipes? The menus revolve around simple, home-style cooking, the type of food some people call \\"comfort\\" food - high-style gourmet it is NOT, which is great if you live on a budget, don't want to spend a fortune feeding your family and just want home-cooked meals that everyone will eat - and that taste great. These are good basic foods like Creamy Mashed potatoes and Chicken Casserole...and even homemade Catsup.	2002-11-08

Sure, this book, written in 1959, is a bit dated - then again, would you really expect a book subtitled What to Wear for Every Occasion to stay in style for over 40 years? If Edith Head could see what people wear today, well...she'd surely be reeling in shock. Her advice, after all, comes from a different generation, a more formal era in fashion.<br />  But fashion tips are really only a small part of the pleasures of this book. What makes it such fun to read is the inimitable style and personality of Edith Head, dressmaker to the stars. She was a true character and thank goodness she lets some of that eccentric genius shine in this book as she discusses her clients, such stars as: Dorothy Lamour...Madeleine Carroll...Mary Martin...Betty Hutton...Veronica Lake...Giner Rogers...Charles Laughton...and more.<br />  The section entitled What to Wear on Every Occasion is both funny and enlightening to read as Edith Head had clear-cut opinions on the Dos and Don'ts of fashion, even advising women what to wear to such diverse events as Prize Fights, Dog Shows and Garden Parties. Don't pass up a chance to grab a copy of this one!	2002-10-26

I'm surprised I'm the first to review this one as I found it an absolute delight, containing the the viewpoints of 56 Jewish mothers and daughters on such diverse subjects as birth, anger, love, belonging, surviving, talking back, leaving home, when a mother dies, etc. Some of the writers were old favorites of mine (Maxine Kumin, Grace Paley) and others were new discoveries ( Robin Becker, Enid Shomer). A very rich collection of works, from poetry to short stories to memoirs.	2002-10-18

Henry stories is maintained in this book (the dialogue, the solid values and homespun wisdom), the illustratons in this book really make it a stand-out. They are full of warmth, rich colors and just a delight in and of themselves, perfectly complimenting the text. There are no shortage of O. Henry collections out there, but this has to be one of the best ,especially for teen to young adult readers.	2002-10-18

Rarely have I read a writer who can write so tightly and yet so explicitly. Starting from a sudden murder of an old man's dog, a murder that is not only senseless but cruel, author Jack Ketchum never lets the pace - or suspense - die in this wonderfully crafted book. All the man wants is an apology and some justice. And yet it seems as if it will never happen. So he has to take things into his own hands. But not in a predictable way, not in a way you see coming. I can't wait to get my hands on his next book.	2002-10-06

I picked this one up with great eagerness, wanting to know what happened to two ex-lovers who met again later in life. Would they see their younger selves reflected in each others' eyes? Or would they find they'd grown apart?<br /> While the author answers these questions, somehow the people in this book just didn't come alive to me. They seemed flat stereotypes, not real, vibrant people. I found myself growing impatient to find out \\"What happened\\" but there was way too much space given to the build-up before the reunion of Emily and Jimmy (her high school sweetheart) and not enough focus on their time together.<br />  Also, each chapter is devoted to the SAME event told by either Emily or Jimmy's point of view. I found this tedious to slog through and somehow irritating as well. In short, this one left me cold....although I managed to stick with it till about halfway through the book.	2002-09-30

The author, Vladislav Tamarov, writes honestly and openly about life during war - how he \\"didn't think\\" at all in the first few weeks but just learned to react, to survive...how he felt torn when he returned home, feeling as if a large part of his life was still waiting for him back in Afghanistan...how he had to shoot men who were just barely out of their teens (or still IN their teens)...how his marriage broke up as he faced the realities of his life after he returned home. Equally haunting are the photos which accompany the text. This one is a unique and very special portrait by a young soldier who deserves to read by as many people as possible.	2002-09-18

Well-written with substantial pieces from women theologians as well as black and liberation perspectives, plus noted theologians such as Thomas Merton, Karl Rahner, etc. Each selection has a very detailed introduction and commments on the life of each theologian and the historical and spiritual significance of his work.

In other words, slathering all the (often expensive) creams, oils and other skin care products on your skin may not make much difference if you don't pay equal attention to what you put UNDER that skin - what you eat. No revolutionary message, here, but not one that many people looking for a \\"quick fix\\" want to hear.<br /> But one worth heeding because I've followed this diet, exercise program and skin care regimen and I can testify from personal experience that it can make a huge difference - not only in how you look but how you feel. Not only did my skin look better but I felt better - and isn't that really a huge part of what looking younger and more vibrant is all about? As a bonus, many of the recipes require nothing more than turning on your broiler and they taste good enough that your kids may even eat them (mine did). This is a program I can follow for life.	2002-09-07

The photos which accompany the text will touch your heart.<br />  But this isn't just a trip down memory lane but an examination and critique of modern life, as seen through the eyes of Zizi, a wise and loving Italian aunt. She happens to be author Gerald Celente's aunt and it is clear that she has been a pivotal figure in his life, offering support and comfort as he went through a traumatic divorce, dispensing wisdom and love as needed. In the hours Celente spends with his aunt, talking and enjoying the meals she prepares (some of the recipes are included in the book), he begins to think about life past and life present and takes the reader along for the ride.<br />  After reading this book, you may find yourself thinking about the pitfalls of modern life and what has been sacrified in the pursuit of progress. You may also think about what the future holds for each of us.	2002-09-01

But she not only survived and came out stronger from her ordeal but even managed to produce an award-winning book (Caleb My son) before succumbing to a 40 year period of writers' block.  She credits psychoanalysis and intense therapy with giving her back her ability to write and even with giving her back her voice, her courage.<br /> This book, which reveals what it is like to be institutionalzied, given shock and insulin treatments and more, should be read by anyone interested in the ongoing debate about whether medication or psychoanalysis is the best treatment for those facing mental illness.<br /> I should note that Daniels has been getting renewed media attention of late for her funding of an innovative  program which allows writers and artists to get free or low-cost therapy for a period of several years. If (as I expect) psychoanalysis proves yet again to have significant value, perhaps the pendulum in the mental health field will swing back from using primarily medications to treat those with depression and other mental illnesses. Someday psychiatrists, psychologists and others in the field may even use analysis and no meds and stop handing out meds like water (now THAT'S a revolutionary thought these days!).	2002-08-31

Born with looks that turned heads and drove men to their knees, Dickinson was not as blessed when it came to her personal life and self-image. She seemed destined to self-destruct but somehow managed to recreate herself until time, drugs and her past caught up with her.<br /> Does this sound like just another dreary tale of a beautiful woman who let fame go to her head. drugs muddle her brain and life pass her by? Think again. Pick this one up and I doubt you'll put it down again till you've read every sentence. FOr one thing, Dickinson has the courage to spill almost all about the ups and downs of her life  (although I'd LOVE to read what she doesn't reveal) and that, in itself, is compelling. She's honest about many of her flaws and revealing about the lives of celebrities who cross her path, including Sylvester Stallone, Christie Brinkley, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty and others. This makes for a juicy read. I'll leave it to you to decide what is true and what isn't. What I CAN say is that this book definitely isn't boring or dry. CAUTION: There are some nude photos in the photo spread so, depending on your values, you may not want to leave this one lying around the house.	2002-08-22

But this book seems to evoke that kind of emotion, filled as it is with images of people at their most open, their most shocking and their most vulnerable...and yes, their most naked. If you are offended by nudity or just plain horrorific images, pass this one by. But if you want a glimpse of the 60s in all its countercultural glory (and naivete), buy this one. Read it. Look at the images and hear the voices of some of the people who were considered icons of the time. It was truly the best and worst of times (stealing from Dickens). But also a courageous moment in our collective history. I'm thankful that Avedon took photos throughout these years.	2002-08-22

Was it ever used as &quot;evidence&quot; in her divorce trial? Did it return to haunt her?<br /> Forgetting those questions, this book is just a fun romp for readers, as Jerry opens up and lets loose on her philosophy about how to handle men...including Mick, who Jerry admits was far than faithful. The picture section is a nostalgic trip through rock's early days and Jerry's younger years as a top model and crazy woman.<br /> My advice? Grab a copy now while the price, high as it is, is within reach. You won't regret it!	2002-08-22

It was worth the wait, revealing the often sordid details of the modeling industry (not that anyone expected it to be a story of purity and idealism, right?). So read this one. But don't stop there. Pick up A Thing of Beauty, which details the rise and fall of Gia Carangi. Then spend some time with Jerry Hall's True Tales (an inside look by Mick Jagger's ex).And finally, round off your reading with No Lifeguard on Duty, written by Janice Dickinson. arguably the world's &quot;first&quot; supermodel and Sylvester Stallone's erstwhile lover.	2002-08-22

This book should receive plenty of attention, since more and more children and teens are being diagnosed with the condition and yet there are relatively few good first person accounts out there. This book is the best I've read so far amd a must for anyone wanting to know more about what it is like to deal with the challenges of handling the ups and downs of being bipolar.<br /> The wrong meds can be harmful or even disastrous for bipolar individuals, especially some of the drugs routinely prescirbed for ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder (some bipolars are mistakenly diagnosed as ADD). One of Simon's episodes, in fact, was triggered when she was given an inappropriate medication, setting her off on a frenzy of hallucinations, delusions and outright pyschotic episodes. But within days of getting on the right meds, she was rational and much more in control of herself. Simon's riveting account of this period in her life underscores the importance of proper diagnosis and medication for those with bipolar illness.<br /> Another plus of this book: Simon met and interviewed about other people with bipolar illness and shares the info here, revealing the range of personalities and individuals who have it.<br /> I found Detour to be an inspiring, educational and very moving book -  honest without being overly dramatic or hokey.	2002-08-18

Because my husband won't touch crisp cookies (no matter how delicious), I bought this book, hoping I'd find at least a few recipes to add to his favorites. I was delighted to find plenty that satisfied his sweet tooth, from classics such as Oatmeal cookies to more unusual selections like Hazelnut Macaroon Brownies. An added bonus- the author offers special tips for making sure cookies come out their softest and chewiest. There are also sections on Cookies for the holidays, cookies for chocolate lovers, cookies kids love (although my kids loved cookies from nearly every section in this book), layered bars, etc. This has become a book I turn to again and again!	2002-08-17

Although I'm not exactly a beginner (more of an intermediate watercolor enthusiast), I learned qute a bit from this book, which is relatively small in size but rich in instruction. I thought I knew quite a bit about mixing colors but found the lessons here to be worth reviewing. The author also lists basic palettes for those interested in drawing flowers and landscapes and guides readers through basic flower shapes with explanations of how to paint them. I spent many hours practicing the various flowers and was richly rewarded with some clear, non-muddy pictures. Although the title \\"A Complete Course\\" may be a bit misleading (I'm not sure there is ever a COMPLETE course in watercolor painting), this would certainly fill the bill for any beginning watercolor painter and I found the results even better than many beginning or intermediate watercolor courses I'd taken - and certainly less expensive.	2002-08-07

Every single one of the characters in this book is compelling and that's no small feat, considering that one of them may not even be alive, at least not in the conventional sense.<br /> As the story opens, John Waters seems to have a fairly stable life, except for the uncertainty that goes along with his choice of career -  searching for oil. He's also settled into a marriage of compromises, loyal to his depressed wife but longing for more. Although he and his wife seem to be committed to one another, their sex life is all but nonexistent after a series of miscarriages.<br /> And then...a voice from the past appears...in the body of a woman named Eve. Eve, however, says she is really John's former love, Mallory, who supposedly died years ago. Not surprisingly, Waters can't believe this far-fetched tale and tries to discover how Eve is pulling off her \\"act.\\" But as time goes on, Waters finds it harder and harder to dismiss her words, crazy as they seem.<br /> I knew Iles was a good writer before I even picked up this book. And yet if someone would have told me I'd read a book that combined elements of horror, suspense and even science fiction (and not only read it but be unable to put it down), I'd have laughed. For one thing, I hate novels which seem to have no basis in the \\"real\\" world. For another, I've found few books that combine all three elements in a way that hold together or make me willing to suspend my belief. But Iles pulls it off and does it so well that you may find yourself (as I did) ignoring the phone, hunger pangs - and even putting off bathroom breaks till the last possible minute.<br />  But this book is more than just a riveting page-turner. Its the kind of work that is thought-provoking as well, turning fiction into a way of seeing deeper truths about the human condition - what it means to fall in love, to revisit the past, to wonder \\"what if\\" - and more. If you want entertainment AND enlightenment, pick up a copy of this one!py of this one!	2002-08-04

And that girlfriend is, of course, Cannie. To make things worse, Cannie is having second thoughts about having dumped Bruce, cad though he is. Will she ever find anyone to love her, especially since she doesn't fit the model-thin stereotype of the desirable woman? Even more importantly, will she learn to accept herself and her body just as it is?<br /> This book could have been just another piece of romantic fluff but stands out from the crowd because author Jennifer Weiner makes Cannie seem very real - and her sense of humor is often laugh out loud hilarious. I really liked Cannie and the descriptions of her feelings about her weight and her dieting struggles are dead on, especially when Cannie takes a dieting program director to task for talking down to her and her fellow dieters.<br /> I should note that some of this book is a tad unbelievable (especially Cannie's \\"instant\\" friendship with a major celebrity) but any shortcomings are more than offset by the delightful style and original voice of the author.	2002-07-27

I'm glad I did. using clear language and concrete examples, Mcgraw updates and adapts his father's Life Strategies so that teens can understand them. He also adds some personal real-life examples to show how teens can either drift along in life or forge their own directions.<br /> I was also pleasantly surprised to find that this wasn't just another cookie cutter self-help book. There are questionnaires designed to make teens think, REALLY think, about what matters to them - and why - and how they can go about achieving their goals. It isn't always an easy read but it is a worthwhile one.<br /> As the parent of a teen, I found the short quizzes and question sections very thought-provoking and they even started some good discussions in our household.	2002-07-19

Judith Singer (first seen in Isaacs's Compromising Positions) has come a long way in 20 years. Her kids are grown, her husband has died and she's teaching English literature at a local college. But mostly, she feels at loose ends...that is, until a suburban housewife, Courtney Logan, is murdered.  Courtney seems to be fulfilled in every way Judith is not, seemingly finding perfect fulfillment in being a stay at home mom, loving spouse and a housewife who could give Martha Stewart a run for her money.<br /> But her murder puts Judith's sleuthing ambitions on full throttle, so much so that she actually knocks on Greg Logan's door (Courtney's husband) and offers her services as a private eye. While he is uninterested, his father, a mob bigwig, decides to hire her.<br /> What develops is a mystery with more than a few twists and turns and unexpected surprises, all wrapped with a healthy dose of humor. A fun read!	2002-07-18

Poor Tiffany Trott is having one heck of a time trying to find the right guy and her friends and family aren't making things any easier with their snide and hurtful comments about the men in her life. Meanwhile, Tiffany can feel her biological and romantic clock ticking away and is beginning to feel a bit panicky about her chances of ever finding someone to marry.<br />  And then, as luck would have it, the right guy comes along...except...he happens to be married. Turns out he's game for an affair but Tiffany (who is Truly Tempted) isn't ready to forego marriage just yet. So she goes back to the dating game, even trying the personals and dating agencies. Meanwhile, she can't stop thinking of the married guy, who she has nicknamed &quot;Seriously Successful&quot;.<br />  I found myself rooting for Tiffany, mainly because she was not only likeable but not the type of fairy tale princess found in many romance novels. Instead she is a resilient woman (if a bit downhearted from time to time) who is all too aware of the pitfalls of relationships. She's had her share of failed romances and rejections but is willing to jump into the fray once again.<br />  Tiffany's &quot;trials&quot; are chronicled with a dose of humor that had me laughing out loud in more than a few spots. Also, the book doesn't just center on Tiffany but provides a sharp view of the London social scene as well. Mostly, this was just a fun read, light but not too fluffy. I look forward to more books about Tiffany.	2002-07-15

A Boy's Summer is a delight, guaranteed to awaken the boy lurking in every man and to inspire boys to find pleasure in timeless pursuits, loved for generations - from walking on stilts to building box traps.<br /> I bought several copies of this one to give as &quot;new baby&quot; gifts - for the fathers of baby boys, because so many new baby gifts include the new mother, but not necessarily the new father. This one reveals what fun can be had in the years to come, activities which can be shared not only by boys and their fathers but perhaps a kindly uncle or big brother).

This may be one of the most eccentric books you'll ever read, full of philosophical musics and random digressions, but it could also be the key to successful and long-term weight loss. Plus there is a killer recipe for bran muffins that not only taste good but provide plenty of fiber (another key to successful weight loss).	2002-06-18

This book proves the point aptly, highlighting several mistakes that turned into common and often-loved inventions (chocolate chip cookies, Coca-Cola, the Slinky). This is an enlightening book to share with kids, encouraging them to realize that taking risks, learning to improvise and experiment is often the best way to learn, even if you don't end up creating something new and wonderful.	2002-06-08

I bought this for one reason - to share with my youngest son and to show him that even the most favorite tunes can be turned inside out and upside down, lending a new perspective to the familiar.<br />  And yes, as some other reviewers have noted, the humor is of the \\"gross-out\\" variety...but let's face it...life is sometimes a bit weird. And who knows this better than kids? So while the original nursery rhymes were mostly full of charm and a light spirit, these may be truer to the truth that kids see in the world. And once you sing Take me Out of the Bathtub to the tune of Take me Out to the Ball Game, you may never be able to get the new lyrics out of your head:<br /> \\"Take me out of the bathtub<br /> Take me out of the tub<br /> I've been soaking since half past two<br /> I feel so sudsy and wrinkle-y too...\\"	2002-06-08

However, there were also some sections of this book that could have been omitted, many repetitions and more than a few recipes that my family wouldn't touch (and for good reason, the food was tasteless).<br /> However, I was able to use the author's suggestions of good foods to make my own meal plans and I found her information about the typical American diet to be intriguing and worthwhile. She also provides fascinating research about how food affects mood and how children and adults with ADD, depression and other conditions may improve their mood and behavior by dietary changes. All in all, a worthwhile read with some uneven sections.	2002-06-05

Even so, I don't think the heat addled my brain - or my viewpoint.<br /> The book was a slow read. It focused on one man, Quoyle, who has had more than his fair share of hard luck. His unfaithful wife, a woman he loved no matter what, has the misfortune to die in a car accident, leaving her two children with Quoyle. He can't seem to hold on to a job at the local newspaper and finally takes a job in Newfoundland. Needless to say, he doesn't think much of himself and doesn't hold out much hope for finding real love. But he is determined to make the best of things, if for no other reason than that he loves his children passionately. They are the focus of his life and he feels a responsibility to them.<br />  The writing is vivid, the details memorable but the plot line is slow and meandering. I got through it only by taking many breaks and drinking lots of caffeine -and, in all honesty, might have given up entirely if the heat hadn't kept me awake.<br /> If you like a lot of action and excitment, this one won't do. On the other hand, if you want a glimpse of a life totally unlike the one you are living (unless you happen to be a Newfoundlander who lives far from civilization), of days spent outside or along the shore, of a hardscrabble existence, you may enjoy reading this one. And Quoyle himself does undergo a metamorphisis of sorts, becoming more hopeful and finding some joy by the close of the book. In case you plan to read this one, I won't give away any more details but will say that this one certainly didn't live up to my expectations.	2002-06-05

Jenny herself is in her 80's, a noted journalist and writer who is somewhat disoriented by her arrival in Miami.<br /> But she is determined to be there for the two sisters who need her most, Eva and Naomi, both in poor health. Her other sister, Flora, is holding her own but somewhat self-centered so that the brunt of the responsibilities fall on Jenny's shoulders.<br />  Although this novel may seem a bit too slow for some readers, I was charmed by the believable portraits of these four women and of the bustling, often chaotic world of Miami. If you have any assumptions about what it is like to be an older woman in American, this novel may burst some of your expectations. These sisters are not \\"little old ladies\\" but vibrant women. They bicker, they kvetch, they refuse to be fade away quietly.Flora has an active sex life and her men troubles are described in hilarious detail.<br /> I'd have given this one 5 stars if it didn't have some uneven parts, some sections that seemed to go nowhere and a few descriptions that were overly long. But all in all, this is a worthy read and notable for portraying an often overlookded group in fiction, women who are in the last years of their lives.	2002-05-31

He has no desire to search his soul, let alone get involved in a serious relationship leading to marriage, children and what he sees as a cluttered, complicated life. He doesn't even have to hold down a job, living on the royalties of a hit song his father wrote years ago, a song that has continued to remain popular.<br />  Will does, however, enjoy brief liasons with women and the one-night stands that come his way. With skewed logic, he decides that his best prospects are single women with children, women who may not want more than a brief fling. So Will attends meetings of SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together), pretending to be the father of a 2 year old child, a child he creates from his imagination.<br /> And that's when complications ensure (but not the type you might expect) as Will befriends a 12 year old boy, Marcus,an adolescent desperatedly in need of a guy who understands what it is like to be a 12 year old boy. Since Will is not much older than that emotionally, he is the perfect companion for Marcus,<br /> Nick Hornsby has never been more on target in his despiction of what it means to be a guy who just wants to stay a boy forever (if a boy could drive a cool car and charm women into bed). But Hornsby also shows what hard work it can be to shut life out, to skim along the surface of things and avoid love, connection and attachment. And he does it with a huge dose of humor, making ths book irresistable.	2002-05-10

But if you want to understand why it can be so difficult to lose weight as you reach those menopause years and what sort of changes you need to make to keep the weight off for life, this may be the only book you need. Well-researched and written, it contained all the information I wanted- details about how the hormonal and physical changes of menopause affect weight gain, the reason why mini-meals are better than larger ones and the type of lifestyle changes I needed to make to take the weight off. And it WORKS- the proof being that I am already 6 pounds lighter in 2 weeks of eating this new way.<br /> My only quibble (and it is a minor one) with this book is that the recipes are not necessarily family friendly (but I have to add that my family is very picky about what they'll eat) and they can take some time to make. However, I liked what I did make and the food was satisfying. Bu<br /> Even with this minor criticism, the book is more than worth the money for the rest of the information and you can always adapt the food suggestions to your own tastes and that of your family. And for the first time in years, the weight is coming off and I feel great!	2002-05-09

He does an excellent job of creating an in-depth analysis of Johnson, of society in those years and, finally, the Civil Rights Act. For sheer depth of  research and enlightening tidbits about Johnson and his years in the Senate, this one is hard to top!	2002-04-30

If you think Rosie O'Donnell is just a comedian with a kind heart (not that that's any small feat), think again. In this memoir she proves herself to be an amazingly good writer as well, able to delve into the deepest recesses of her life and bring forth the emotional gems of her life's history. Her honesty is touching as well, whether she is writing about her continuing struggles with insecurity, depression and the mixed blessings of being a celebrity or how hard it can be to balance a desire to save the world with limitations of time and energy.<br />  While I couldn't put this book down, it was not always an easy read. O'Donnell's memoir was sparked by an unexpected encounter with a person named Stacie and the feelings that Stacie evoked in Rosie.  Parts of these encounters were so painful to read that I had to put the book down and take a breather before returning to it.<br /> I can't give you too many details of Stacie's life without spoiling the book for you but I can say that Stacie evokes memories in Rosie that help create this memoir.<br />  While everyone knows O'Donnell is a funny, funny lady, if you are expecting this book to be filled with humor and jokes, you should probably look elsewhere. But if you want to know more about the real Rosie O'Donnell, the person who exists beyond the glare of studio lights and television appearances, you won't be disappointed. I admit I was surprised by how moving this book was. Kudos to Rosie!	2002-04-22

The detailed color charts which not only show the various shades of each color (light to dark) but also notes their degree of permanence, durablility and opaqueness.<br />2. Each flower type is painted in detail and the drawings show how to build light and shadow to give the illusion of a 3-dimensional flower<br />3.

I have a child with ADD and have built up a large collection of books about the subject but this is absolutely the BEST book I've found which is specifically written FOR children. There are other books for children out there but they all far short of this one. Why?<br /> First of all, this book truly  seems to have been written with an understanding of how to reach an ADD kid. The text is clear, easily understood and to the point. For kids who don't want to read long, detailed paragraphs, there are checklists and other tools to maintain attention. Secondly, this book packs a lot of information on a wide variety of subjects that can be difficult for kids with ADD, from sports to friendships to schoolwork. Finally, there are practical and realistic suggestions for dealing with challenges - everything from making friends to learning how to pay attention and get work done at school. The author clearly knows about ADD and I've read this one with my child again and again (plus he's taken it to his room and read it alone numerous times).	2002-03-29

This book explores all sorts of psychiatric drugs for conditions ranging from Attention Deficit Disorder to depression, bipolar disorder, etc. Each section is clear and each medication is discussed fully, including possible side effects. I've often felt like doctors haven't fully answered my questions about certain medications but this book helped me to fill in the gaps and feel confident about the choices I made for my child. The best book on the subject I've found so far (and I've looked at quite a few books).	2002-03-29

The book provides lists of all the information you need, from a social security number for some searches to a phone number or simply a last name for others. While there are probably other ways to locate this information and the book may not contain every last shred of info out there, this is a good detailed guide to start with - and it may be ALL you need.	2002-03-28

Along the way, they hoped to sell their paintings and, with luck, find a home for themselves. What they couldn't foresee were the hardships, strokes of luck and unknown adventures that awaited them - from near starvation when the money ran out to the strokes of luck that come their way. Luckily, Dori DeCamillis managed to chronicle it all in vivid, impossible-to-put-down language, making the whole trip come alive for the reader. This one has a permanent space on my bookshelf, along with My Side of the Mountain, Swiss Family Robinson, The Boxcar Children, Breaking Clean and other classic memoirs of life lived outside the realm of normal and conventional.	2002-03-28

Henry award winner as well as work which has appeared previously in The New Yorker) I'd strongly suggest that buyers also purchase some of the wonderful audios which are out there as his works truly deserve to be heard aloud.<br />  But if you prefer to simply read these stories rather than hear them, you won't be disappointed, either. What makes Stephen King's work, even the most horrorific stories, stand apart from others in the genre are the way they touch the spirit of readers and make them ponder the deeper mysteries of life - and death. Future writers will enjoy reading King's own remarks about what he was trying to accomplish with each story. The title story, told from the viewpoint of a teenager, is bittersweet and even touching. Rumors are that King is going to stop writing for good or maybe just for a long while. Don't miss your chance to grab this one while it is available.	2002-03-26

The BAD - The story is short, short, short - 10 pages in all and a child left alone with this book could possibly tear off the tail (which is, after all, a major part of the \\"gimmick\\" to this book).

While Ian McEwan's novel seemingly centers around one day and evening when a series of unfortunate events cascades into tragedy for one family, this is only one layer in this mesmerizing book. Below the surface are questions about sin, human fraility, love and, finally, atonement. At the heart of the book is a young girl names Briony and her unformed views of the world which lead her to unfortunate conclusions. As McEwan describes her perspective: ..\\"her life now beginning had sent her a villain in the form of an old family friend...that seemed about right- truth was  strange and deceptive, it had to be struggled for, against the flow of the everyday...\\"<br /> Until I encountered this book, I had begun to wonder if there was truly anything new and original to be read in literature - or only a rehash of themes that had already been worked to death. But McEwan's book not only kept me glued to my seat until I'd finished every last page and read every single word (but slowly, so I could savor the best lines), but made me rethink my beliefs. It made me think about not only love, family ties and betrayals and truth versus fiction but left a reverberation that continues to echo through my days. If this sounds overblown and sentimental, I urge you to read this book yourself before coming to any judgments.	2002-03-16

But his general theories about the way baby boomers will age and affect the economy is valid and this book provides plenty of food for thought. I think it makes sense that many baby boomers, as Dent suggests, will have to allocate more and more of their income for health care and may also wish to downsize and spend less money as they age - or they may have no other choice but to spend less. As a firm believer that spending goes in cycles and that people of various ages spend differently, this book held a lot of information that I found useful. But if you read it with the idea that EVERY prediction is set in stone and will come true, you're better off going to a fortune teller. Take it for what it is worth, a set of theories or general ideas and trust your own instincts. When seen in this light, the book is an intriguing and even eye-opening read.	2002-03-12

This one has been called a &quot;thinking person's thriller&quot; and the description fits.<br />  But none of this takes anything away from this wonder of a book, winner of Britain's Silver Dagger Award for Fiction - and deservably so. Author Giles Blunt brings each character to life with an expert hand.Blunt has the rare ability to make readers care about his characters, flaws and all, so much so that I deliberately read the last chapters slowly, not wanting the book to end.<br />  And what people inhabit this book! There's the basically good but lonely cop who may or may not have a dark secret in his past, the fellow detective who is covertly investigating him, the pair of skewed killers who prey on hapless adolescents with a veneer of friendliness which masks their ruthless desires and tortures.<br /> I confess that I didn't open this one with high expectations, having read far too many works by first-time authors that just didn't hold my interest, had serious flaws or were lacking in depth, solid characters, a believable story line. So it was an  delightful surprise to have my expectations overturned. I look forward to reading more books by Blunt.	2002-03-12

This dilutes the real message in the book - that the news has a bias toward liberal issues and slanted reporting at the expense of anything approaching objectivity. By the time I got to Chapter 3, I was tired of reading attacks on Jennings and was hungry for more information and real examples of biased reporting. Isn't this what the book was supposed to be about? Instead, Goldberg comes across as someone with an ax to grind - mostly against Jennings.	2002-03-10

If you are considering plastic surgery, you need to get this book first. WHY? Well, for one thing, the price is a bargain compared to surgery, even when you throw in the often costly cosmetic and vitamins the author recommends. And if, like me, you see a NOTICABLE difference in your skin, you may realize that plastic surgery can be put off for awhile...maybe even forever. This author has the credentials to back up everything he says and a list of celebrity clients with glowing skin that bear witness to his results.<br />  Although I was initially skeptical, I can say that finally, finally, I found something that gets results. The suggestions listed here work - and even better, they work even if you don't follow EVERY single step. Drink more water, take the vitamins, use the products and you'll see a difference. Do more and I assume the results will be better.<br />  But even if you don't see a remarkable difference in your skin (although I think you will) in a few days or, at most, a few weeks...and decide you still want plastic surgery, you should still have this book. Why? Because you will be going into the operation with the BEST skin of your life and be prepared to have the BEST results. So,either way, this book is a must-have.	2002-03-04

The memoir she wrote after finally breaking free of this life is not sentimental and doesn't ask for pity from the reader. It was the only life she'd known and plenty of people lived this  way in Montana, expecting a rough life and bearing up to the hardships that came their way.<br /> But what Blunt does, as few writers can, is open her eyes and really look fully at the world, coming up with vivid, original descriptions of the animals, the land, the people around her. Those familiar with farm life may find their eyes reopened by Blunt's writing and those unfamiliar with it will simply love discovering this book.<br /> But I warn you - it isn't an easy read. There are plenty of farm accidents, bitter weather and descriptions of a community filled with people who don't have time for softness. They're too busy trying to get through each day and simply survive. What is amazing is that one person, Blunt herself, not only survived but ended up being an amazing writer, bringing alive the world she lived in.	2002-03-04

Psychoanalyst  Dr. Frederick Starks, who is at the heart of this one, is being threatened by someone connected to his past in some way. Poor Dr. Starks is given the choice between killing himself within 15 days or facing the reality that those he knows will be picked off one by one, randomly and suddenly, by someone known only as \\"Rumplestiltskin\\" (or by one of his accomplices).<br />  In the meantime, Rumplestiltskin wreaks havoc on Stark's life, destroying his credit, cancelling bank accounts, even murdering ex-patients. To his credit, author John Katzenbach keeps the clues coming while upping the tension at the same time.<br /> I felt like Dr. Stark's life had become something out of the Twilight Zone, one which no longer contained the normal perameters which many of us take for granted. His home is no longer a haven (Rumplestiltskin invades it at will), his computer and tax records are stoken, even his accounts are up for grabs. All this, of course, takes a toll and Dr. Stark begins to feel the stress. Can Dr. Stark find the madman behind all this before he himself unravels? I couldn't stop reading till I found out.	2002-02-28

Then ask yourself, as this author did, what would YOU feel and what would YOU do if your child, an adolescent, was left paralyzed from the neck down? In those first days when your child couldn't even speak what would you think about? That's the painful situation author Richard Galli found himself facing after his son Jeffrey was paralyzed after a freak accident in a swimming pool, an accident which left him unable to move from the neck down.<br />  This account is a heartfelt, painfully honest description of the first ten days after the accident (when Jeffrey is basically unconscious) and what many readers have found hard to believe is how Jeffrey's father could contemplate ending his son's life. But I understood how his understanding of the life his son had lived before the accident and the horror of the life his son would lead afterwards, in all their limitations, could lead him to contemplate his son's death.<br />  In the end, it is Jeffrey himself who is the final determinant of his life or death. I won't give away the ending but simply recommend you read this one.	2002-02-24

And what if that money came from a deceased parent's home? This is the dilemna at the heart of this book.<br /> If you're expecting another Grisham legal thriller, don't buy this one. This one is far less about legal battles than moral ones. Unfortunately, the plot just doesn't hold together all that well and even the moral struggles, as described here, aren't all that engaging. Grisham isn't in top form here.<br /> For one thing, Ray Atlee, the dead judge's son who finds the money, isn't even that riveting or likeable a guy. Secondly, there are plenty of plot holes and illogical moves. Ray, for instance, discloses the whereabouts of the money to people who are almost complete strangers. Why would he do this? Made no sense to me.<br />  Still, this book did make me wonder what I would do with a sudden windfall of three million plus change. But I've read a much better book about this, A Simple Plan, a book about three men who find a fortune in a crashed plane. A Simple Plan is wonderfully written, suspenseful and darkly realistic. But save your bucks and avoid The Summons.	2002-02-24

But Dubus's writing is simply that powerful and that descriptive. If you haven't seen the movie, by the way, the title story focuses on a family whose son is murdered by his lover's ex, setting into motion a plan for revenge. I've rarely had the pleasure of reading a writer who is able to say so much in so few pages.	2002-02-24

Simon Shea, a retired college professor used to living a rather solitary life, becomes frightened after he has a few episodes of forgetfulness, the worst one causing an overheated pan to set his kitchen on fire. Shaken and feeling suddenly old, he decides he needs to commit himself to a rest home. In short, he no longer feels competent to live the independent life he's relished for so long and fears he is losing his mind.<br />  This is, of course, a BIG mistake for Simon has plenty of vim and energy left and his mind is just fine. Luckily, he has a perceptive young doctor who sees his potential even when Simon's spirits falter and a visit from his wife (who Simon hasn't seen in years) also helps to set things straight. But before that happens, Simon has to confront his own demons, revisit his memories of teaching, marriage and...finally...re-examine his religious beliefs and come to terms with how they've shaped his life.<br />  But this book is far, far more than I can describe here. Simon Shea is a complex, enigmatic character, nothing like the stereotypes of the elderly that fill too many books these days. It was a joy to get to know him and by the end of this novel, I felt I wanted to see waht happened to Simon. Wonder if there is a sequel to this one out there?	2002-02-23

Just like fingerprints, every cook's dishes look and taste different and her show will give you a feel for her cooking &quot;personality&quot;, style and techniques If you relate to that ( I do), read on...<br />  Next, keep in mind that Lawson creates dishes for those who are willing to expand their cooking repertoires, to be a bit experimental and even daring. If you don't like to use spices or have kids who hate them, you might want to avoid this book. But if you like a bit of snap and zing to your meals and think of cooking as akin to creating visual delights and new feasts for the palate, this book may be just what you need to broaden your horizons.

I also wanted to understand why illustrations were used far more often than photos, even after photos were used for the ads within the magazines themselves.<br /> This book was just what I needed to understand not only what the illustrators were trying to say about women's roles at the time but about how so many of these images and stereotypes of the \\"ideal\\" woman still permeate our magazines (and culture) today. If you've ever doubted that \\"what goes around comes around again\\" when it comes to women's stereotypes and ideals, reading this book may change your mind.<br />  For those familiar with such icons of The Golden Age of Illustration as C. Coles Phillips's Fadeaway Girls or the rather sophisticated women of J. C. Leyendecker or any other artists of the time, this book will be a delight, revealing new insights about the artists visions. For those interested in social history, the book is equally engaging, showing how artist who drew cover girls for popular magazines such as Life, Saturday Evening Post and Good Housekeeping also worked for major businesses and even the government, helping to perpetuate the popular images of women throughout the culture.	2002-02-20

The book starts off with a bang as James Piper falls head over heels in love (or is it just lust?) for Materia Mahmoud and lures her into a marriage with him, against her family's strong objections.<br />It isn't long before the couple realize they have little but physical attraction in common but the marriage produces several children, each of them intriguing in turn.

This book filled the bill, especially the sections which revealed how children use power (and even bullying) to both include some children and exclude others. I think most of us remember the playground bullies but what this book did was show how parents can help to change bullying behavior, give their children skills to handle bullies and lessen the damaging effects of their behavior.<br />  This book focuses on far more than bullies and those who purchase it will find it filled with rich insights into the social world of children and how they view their friendships and connections with other children.	2002-02-19

This one also has all the earmarks of a book written by a newer writer, with sections alternating between sentimentality and dark humor....not always in the smoothest manner.

Most importantly, this author provided detailed information I hadn't found in other books and made me realize that being informed can make menopause a natural stage in a woman's life - not necessarily a completely smooth one, but certainly manageable and understanable.	2002-02-07

Then a woman suddenly appears and moves in. Why she appears and what compells her to arrive, move in and take up with this man isn't obvious.<br />  It helps to suspend any sense of reality when reading this one since the author makes no attempt to explain how this man and woman keep their food supplies stocked, how they spend most of their time etc. Even so, I found this to be an original and engaging book about the \\"battle of the sexes\\" even in the most minimum, sparest of circumstances.<br />  Also, when I stopped trying to make \\"sense\\" of the situation described here, I realized that this book isn't about the real world as much as how men and women see things differently and how even a simple tin house in the middle of nowhere can become problematical for them. Different from the author's first two books, but a worthy successor all the time.	2002-02-06

Still, I couldn't put it down, riveted by the lives of these three men, the various crises that came up and their way of bumbling through each day as best they could.

Secondly, do yourself a favor and don't download these books. Try to find them in book form becaue you'll want the originals to stay on your shelf, ready to be picked up and read again and again.<br />Finally, here's the reason you should read this series: it is an orignal, well-done and witty flirtation and eventually full-blown romance between a man and woman who meet online. This is the FIRST romance series I ever read which was written from a cyber perspective, complete with emoticons (a crash course in them, in fact, useful if you've not particularly computer-savvy). I've read others since then but this is still my favorite. If you don't have much time to read but love a good romance, this one moves quickly but is fullfilling and emotionally engaging.

It is also a revealing and often hilariously funny memoir about what happens to a woman who has the courage to follow her dreams, however far-fetched, and the unforeseen challenges and pleasures which follow. Think of this one as a picture postcard where the beauty shines through in spite of the sharp edges and rough spots which soon become apparent behind the pretty veneer.<br />  In this case the dream is to live on a farm, even though author Jeanne Marie Laskas (and her boyfriend, Alex) know nothing about country life. The solitude. The occasional hunters who shoot at everything and everyone. The wildlife which ignores the boundary between inside and outside.<br />  Undeterred, they take the plunge and buy their farm even after a daunting conversation with the former homeowners about well-water filtration systems, chain saws, raccoon invasions and a particularly gruesome tale of a rat which entered the house through a hole in an oven. But as the author herself notes, they are &quot;in hot pursuit... of a dream&quot; and a little reality isn't likely to stand in their way.<br />  What sets this book apart from other country memoirs is the author's sense of what makes for a good story. You won't find lengthy and often boring descriptive passages here. Written in a crisp, action-packed style with plenty of soul, this one is a likely to become a classic.  An absolute charmer, punctuated with plenty of wit and spirit to spare!	2002-01-17

Written in 1934, the novel follows the life of one family, the Oppermanns, and the increasing restrictions and hatred they face in their daily lives. Unwilling to believe these rejections and restrictions are anything but &quot;temporary&quot;, they are unprepared for the the way &quot;their&quot; community turns against them, but forced to deal with the inevitable consequences. I found this a very believable work, impossible to put down. The introduction by Ruth Gruber (she spoke with the author) helps place this work into a historical perspective.	2002-01-14

Author Larry Brooks, a former business executive himself, turns the world of corporate seminars and training exercises into the stuff of mystery, intrigue, murder and heart-stopping suspense..impossible to put down. At the heart of this book is The Seminar, a grueling course designed to force execs to face their deepest fears and come to grips with life and death situations.<br />  I thought I had some idea where this one was going but was surprised (and then delighted) to find my expectations turned upside down, again and again. Anyone who reads this one will be hard-pressed to figure out where The Seminar ends and reality begins and who is pulling the strings all along. Not just another copycat novel, but a truly original book which is a must-read! And if you're in the movie business, this one is a no-brainer for a great movie!	2001-12-29

Roald Dahl was able to interview Gordon Butcher, the man who originally found the Roman silver on his land, no small feat since Butcher had become suspicious of writers and journalists after being cheated out of a fortune that should have been his. The account, mostly in Butcher's own words, of the discovery is absolutely entrancing and Dahl has the wisdom to keep the story tight and lean, while preserving the details about Butcher and that memorable day when his life changed forever.<br />  I have had a hard time finding true historical accounts which I can share with my entire family and which will hold the interest of both children and adults. With pictures on nearly every page (by the inimitable Ralph Steadman) and vivid writing which makes history come alive, this one fits the bill.	2001-12-23

World War two, the birth of television, the development and use of the atomic bomb are all seen through the eyes of Ethel and Ernest. I was charmed by the two of them, from their earliest days together to the purchase of their first house, birth of their son, wartime experiences (gas masks, blackout curtains, sending their 5 year old son to the country to be safe during the war), their son's marriage and the gradual decline and death of Ethel and Ernest. Jumps off the page!	2001-12-23

The title of this one could be a bit misleading and confusing. More accurately described as 11 shorter books or novellas, this one is a treasure trove of fine writing by wonderful writers (William Styron, Eudora Welty, Philip Roth, Ernest J. Gaines, Stanley Elkin, Jane Smiley and more). Arranged so that there is at least one story from each decade since the 40's, this book offers a look at some of the finest writing out there - not only from today but from years past.<br /> This book is a bargain as well. With the price of books being so high these days, if you tried to buy these 11 books separately, you'd be hard-pressed to find them all for a price anywhere near the cost of this volume. Lots of wonderful reading and a great price to boot make this one an easy pick.	2001-12-23

All of this is liberally seasoned with wit, detail and irresistable dialogue. The psychological suspense will keep you guessing what will happen next and there is just enough complexity to maintain interest without slowing the pace.

Mary Higgins Clark and her daughter seem to weave magical stories with ease and this one is a totally riveting and wonderfully seasonal Christmas story, with echoes of the classic movie Its a Wonderful Life - if updated a bit for contemporary readers.<br />  The story, in brief: In his lifetime Sterling Brooks was blessed with the intelligence and luck to get by without much effort. In the Afterlife, however, he's been stuck been waiting at Heaven's Gate for 50 years, hoping vainly to get into heaven. Opportunity strikes when the Heavenly Council decides to try a new &quot;experiment&quot;. Sterling, they decide, must return to Earth and<br />help someone else.<br />  And not just anyone. In this case, Sterling is sent to help Marissa, a young girl whose family has been placed in a Federal Protection Program. Can Sterling help her get back to the ones she loves?<br />  What makes this story even more special is that it is set in New York, with charm and nostalgia to warm the heart. I read this one in one afternoon and then read it aloud to the rest of my family. This book could become a Christmas classic itself; it is simply that good.	2001-12-20

I love every single book in the Lieberman series but this one is a particular favorite. As always, Lieberman is both worldly wise and all too human, with weaknesses that make him just that more believable and strangely lovable as well.<br />  This time around, Lieberman and his associate, Hanrahan, are trying to guard the ex-wife and son of a mob informant while juggling the daily frustrations of their own lives. While the mystery will keep your attention, what is equally wonderful, to my mind, are Lieberman and Hanrahan, two guys who jump from the pages in vivid detail. Kaminsky is a wonderful writer and I hope more than mystery buffs discover him. He deserves the attention!	2001-12-19

I loved this book so much that I've added the author to my list of favorites for the year and am eagerly awaiting his next book (due in March 2002). If its anywhere near as good as this one, I'll be up all night reading it.<br /> But on to this book: Adam's Fall takes place in the world of an elite university and author, Sean Desmond, a Harvard graduate, clearly knows the world about which he writes. The pressures, anxieties and competition of a top university are all revealed here. But the novel is more than that - at the heart of the book is a mystery, focusing on a murder (suicide?) and a love triangle.<br />  What kept me glued to the pages of this one was way Desmond created his world and left just enough suspense to keep my interest. Was the suicide really a murder? What happened just before then? And is there something supernatural or unearthly behind all this or is the protagonist simply going slowly, but undeniably, insane? Could Adams Fall be haunted or is it the protagonist's soul which is haunted? The answers aren't clear till the end...meanwhile, things get stranger and stranger. Bloody sheets. Possible ghosts. Eerie sightings. All written so vividly it'll make every last hair stand up on your neck.<br />  Although I really enjoyed this one, readers should be warned that this novel has some of the flaws of a book written by a first-time writer - some awkward plot sequences, a few slow parts, a tendency to bog down some sections with overdescription.<br /> On the other hand, it has oarts that so perfectly capture the life of college students and the pain and confusion of searching for one's identity that I found it easy to overlook the flaws. Kudos to Desmond for a promising debut!	2001-12-07

I have always loved reading old magazines, newspapers and other pieces of our cultural history - and part of that pleasure comes from reading more than just the articles. The advertisements and other &quot;incidental&quot; material is a key part of understanding the total history and feel of a period in history - to my mind.<br />  That's why Baker's book, focusing on the destruction of magazines and newspapers (which are partially saved on microfilm) in the name of &quot;progess&quot; was so painful (but enlightening) to read. The thought of all those magazines, all those newspapers, being torn apart and only partially saved , seemed like a great loss to me. This book deserves to be read and discussed - but more importantly, more people need to become involved in trying to save the actual existing newspapers and magazines - in their original forms - before they are lost forever.	2001-11-30

That's one of the situations in the book - and it makes for a totally suspenseful and unique tale.<br /> Believable characters that I cared about, continuing suspense and twists that I didn't foresee are what kept me glued to the pages of this one. Even the killer has his reasons, however skewed, and he truly believes he is &quot;saving&quot; the children he murders. What I found particularly compelling in this book was the portrait of the teenager, Ian. By the time he and his stepsister disappear, they've become truly compelling characters and the reader cares about what happens to them.	2001-11-29

Not being a major science fiction buff, this wasn't number one on my list of books to read. But after my 17 year old son read it and said it was &quot;really great&quot;, I picked it up and stayed up till 5 am to finish it. And I had to admit it was not only a well-written and totally engaging mystery about a man who may or may not be an alien from another plant - but also one of the more thought-provoking books I've read in months. Even reluctant readers should enjoy this one!<br /> One minor quibble and it isn't the author's fault - the book has been made into a move and before reading this book, I'd seen the media blitz on televison and movie trailers for the movie, featuring Kevin Spacey as alien Prot. So I couldn't read the book without envisioning Spacey as Prot. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I prefer to use my imagination to picture characters. Other than that, I found this to be a wonderful book.	2001-11-27

Some readers, however, might consider this a recommendation for this book, depending on their tastes (not me). I'm able to stomach violence if there are other redeeming factors to a book, but this one didn't have strong, compelling characters or other qualities to balance the violence.<br />  The story itself focuses on Mary Crow, a woman who lost her mother to a violent murder and rape and whose entire life has been shaped by that traumatic event, eventually leading her into a life as a lawyer, prosecuting criminals. After trying several especially grueling cases in a row, she decides to take a vacation with two of her best friends. But two men (one with vengence on his mind against Mary, the other a deranged bad guy living in the woods) end up making the camping trip more terrifying than fun.<br />  There isn't anything particularly surprising about this book and you'll see what's coming ahead of time. If your interest is held by violence and you don't care much about characters seeming real, you won't mind reading this one - and your interest will be held. But I felt less than satisfied.	2001-10-17

Black boxes are those voice recorders which monitor the voices of airplane pilots and often contain details which explain how and why a plane crashed. Author Malcolm McPherson has brought to life the last moments of passengers and crew during the worst kinds of emergencies imaginable and I doubt you'll be able to put this one down. In many cases, the recordings have never been shared in their entirety before so this book is a rare chance to get details you might not read about otherwise.<br />Some of the incidents are famious (such as the 1996 ValuJet crashin the Everglades) and others are less well-known. McPherson does have a few errors in this book, mostly in explaining the terminology of aviation but his basic information is accurate and only the most diehard aviation buffs will mind the errors.	2001-10-04

Written by a Pakistani journalist who is familar with Afghanistan and the realities of living in a harsh terrain, the history of the country and culture, the book is both engaging and enlightening. I thought I was &quot;reasonably&quot; informed about people and events in that area of the world until I read this book. Afterwards, I realized that the rise of Islam Fundamentalists depended not only on the social and cultural history I knew about but on smaller details I didn't (but which the author provides) including art, environment, class, economics and more.	2001-09-24

His writing is unique, clear and memorable, whether he is writing about what he sees out his window or about life in New York walking down a busy sidewalk, masses of people all around him. While life in New York has changed significantly since E.B. White first wrote the words contained in this book, readers will find his writing also timeless in spirit and inspirational in invoking a renewed appreciation for New York and the little details that make it special. White once said of his writing: 'Writing to me is not an exercise in addressing readers, it is more as though I were talking to myself while shaving'. If only we could all be as articulate, memorable and even humorous while talking to ourselves and others! A very special book, worth reading and re-reading.	2001-09-24

This book provides that information, from accounts of experiments with various biological weapons and agents, interviews with workers in the field and more. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to be as informed as possible and who wants to make whatever decisions are possible to protect their families and friends. I won't kid you- the book doesn't purport to say that we are in control of the future or that all dangers can be avoided.

After reading Gap Creek,  the story of a young southern woman struggling in a difficult marriage,I knew I'd buy anything else Morgan wrote. I'm happy to say this story of two brothers locked in a sibling rivalry, while far different from the plot of Gap Creek, doesn't disappoint. Muir and Moody Powell have been at odds nearly since birth. One is ambitious and hard-working and the other is drawn to trouble, gambling and drinking. Don't let my simple sketch of the bare outline of this book keep you from reading it.

Too bad the author didn't get to conclude this book with the Williams sisters penultimate match against one another. Short of that, however, I can't imagine this book being more entertaining. Fans of women's tennis know that matches have gotten more exciting in recent years, arguably as entertaining as men's tennis. Author L. Jon Wertheim has managed to score a cup by getting into the hidden inner circles of the women's tennis world, spending a year with a tour. The result is a close-up view that is intriguing, exciting and impossible to put down and profiles the major players in tennis, including Martina Hingis, Monica Seles, Jennifer Capriati and the Williams sisters.<br />What even the most avid fans of women's tennis don't get to see - the behind-the scenes gossip, intrigue and behavior that are part of the whole scene - are revealed here. Egotism, bitchiness and incredibly dysfunctional famililies add to the drama. I'd suggest that any family with an aspiring young tennis &quot;star&quot; in their midst give this book to that person and let her know what could await her in the future. If she decides to pursue the sport, anyway, maybe she truly has the determination to become the next star of the courts.	2001-09-09

If you like mysteries with a strong psychological twist, this one may be right up your alley. On the other hand, if you like your mysteries full of action, intrigue and danger, better to pass this one up. After her father, Jud Connors, is found brutally murdered, his daughter, Abby, is determined to find out who killed him. While far from perfect and prone to womanizing, Abby's father, a famous writer, is not the sort of man who made enemies easily and there doesn't seem to be a single person who held a grudge against him. As Abby delves into his writings, however, she begins to uncover layers about her father's life -and past.<br />  I read this one in a quick gulp, staying up to finish it in a single evening.

There are some rare and hard to find pieces here, including ones that collectors may never have seen before as well as photos of items which never made it into stores. I always enjoy looking at vintage advertisements for glass and dinnerware and this book doesn't dissappoint in that area, containing ads from Gladding, McBean, Franciscan Ware, Catalina Pottery and more - many from the earliest years. The photos are so well done that I was truly amazed at the quality of the color and accurate representation of each piece.  There are special Collectors' Notes throughout the book which make it easier for the collector to find representative pieces of shapes and patterns and to distinguish specific items. There are complete piece guide checklists as well, helping collectors determine which items they have and which they may need to complete a set. Highly recommended!	2001-09-08

Potential buyers should be aware that the focus is on patterns made before 1960. There are specific chapters on the Azalea Pattern, scalloped and multisided patterns, backstamps and a detailed bibliography (for those who want to do more research), glossary, an explanation of how to find specific patterns, etc. The historical info, while not lengthy, is clear and sufficient to satisfy all but the most obsessive collector. I learned quite a bit that I didn't know before and found many, many patterns which I'd seen online and at auctions but hadn't been able to locate elsewhere. It was an extra pleasure looking at the photos of actual ads, including those from Morimura Brothers (a company whose success at matching Japanese production with American designs led directly to the birth of Noritake). This book was an absolute delight to read and one I plan to use again and again.	2001-09-08

While I'd recommend this as a &quot;must read&quot; book to anyone in business, this book should be read by a wider audience as well. The stories cover a gamut of emotions and reactions to the art of the &quot;pitch&quot; and many are thought-provoking. Yes, this is fiction, but there are some classic lessons here about the virtues of persistence and drive and a willingness to go the extra mile to reach a goal. In addition to such well-known writers as Thomas Wolfe, John Updike, David Mamet, Philip K. Dick and Flannery O'Connor, there are other writers which should be new to the reader. I'm not in sales (unless you consider convincing a reluctant teenager to clean his room or take out the trash a &quot;sales pitch&quot;) but I couldn't put this book down. I came away realizing that the core values of a good salesperson are ones many of us hold dear- being persistant, having drive and ambition, reaching a goal.There are too many stand-outs in this collection to say that any one is the best but I was particulary intrigued by Philip Dick's tale about a robot who wouldn't take no for an answer, an unpredictable tale with a great twist at the end.	2001-09-05

I'd consider this one a must for those interested in Jewish drama, literature and/or Holocaust studies.<br />  Tabori's drama was often more avant-garde than traditional and frequently shocking and provocative. One play, Cannibals, portrayed concentration camp inmates who were prepared to eat another inmate to survive and others of his &quot;Holocaust&quot; (Jubilee, My Mother's Courage, Mein Kampf) are equally revolutionary and non-conventional.<br />  The author, Anat Feinberg, uses archival material to round out this well-written and detailed portrait of an unusual dramatist. There is also a photo section which I found captivating and quite interesting.	2001-09-03

Many kids may wonder &quot;What is this really all about? Why am I doing this?&quot; This inspiring, clearly-written book urges kids to think about the deeper meaning of the ceremony and of being a Jew. The emphasis is on spirituality and being mindful of God's presence everyday. I especially liked the section with suggestions and resources for acts of tzedakah as well as little mitzvahs.	2001-09-03

But what, if anything, do they believe spiritually? Starting with a close-up look at the lives of seven specific individuals, the author goes on to examine the various religious and other institutions which appeal to the Boomer generation. The author makes the case that there is a genuine &quot;boomer culture&quot;, giving details and examples to prove his point.He also illustrates the trends in religion and the subcultures that are emerging, including &quot;loyalists&quot; (those who never truly dropped out of a religious tradition), &quot;returnees&quot; (those who dropped out but later returned) and &quot;dropouts&quot; as well as privatized religions and alternative groups. The final section of the book discusses implications for the future of our society. Overall, a thoughtful, well-researched book with fascinating details.	2001-08-30

From the first page, I was smitten with the couple and the writing, which is as smart, sassy, funny and quick-paced as New York itself. A sample bit, as Roz and Edwin are driving home to meet his family, including mother Esther, very early one morning:  Edwin said.....&quot;Esther's  up and at 'em by five. She'll probably have breakfast made already.&quot;... &quot;Oh, good lord&quot; Roz moaned. Edwin:&quot;Probably not best to take the Lord's name in vain around her either, especially at this hour of the day.&quot; Roz: &quot;Jesus, I forgot.&quot;.... &quot;Jesus, we're in trouble&quot; Edwin said to the sky.  One more thing about this delightful novel: if you've ever read and enjoyed the late writer Laurie Colwin's books you'll definitely find similarities here, as this is somewhat a comedy of manners, a thinking person's guide to the intricacies of the human heart, full of style and wit.	2001-08-04

I found the use of personal correspondence, diaries and manuscripts helped to bring this writer alive. For those who aren't familiar with Lockhart, tbe late writer was a woman ahead of her time, writing such popular novels as The Fighting Shepherdess as well as working as a journalist with her own newspaper column. Her novels were quite popular but her real-life is equally fascinating and Furman gives an objective, well-written portrait of a writer who broke conventions and forged her own path.	2001-08-03

After reading it, I not only advocated for the proper dosage of meds for my condition, but joined Weight Watchers, tailored the diet to suggestions in Thyroid Power and have lost many pounds - for the first time in years! If you, too, want to feel empowered and have some control over your condition, I'd say this book is a must. In addition to a very detailed description of traditional thyroid tests and treatments, Shames has the courage to discuss what could be WRONG with some of these tests, including questionnaires to help individuals gain information about their condition.  For years, I had many of the symptoms described in this book: vauge aches and pains, overwhelming tiredness, bouts of anxiety and depression, weight gain, sleep problems and more. And yet I believed I was on the right dosage of medication because my doctor said so and the tests said so. But as Thyroid Power notes, there is more to thyroid conditions than lab tests alone can reveal. Shames also takes a look at foods which affect the thyroid and various vitamins, minerals and herbs that could be beneficial. If you like to take the best of conventional medicine AND holistic treatments, don't pass them one up.	2001-08-02

I don't fall into any of those categories and I LOVED reading this book, which actually focuses on the positive side of having (and surviving) a life-threatening illness. Armstrong makes the intriguing argument that he came back from cancer with a new, stronger focus, a new perspective on his life and a determination to make the most of every day after that. Not only that, but he was able to win the Tour de France in spite of having NO sponsor (none of them were willing to believe he would succeed), many detractors and the knowledge that his body had endured a massive assault of chemicals, chemotherapy, etc. But his atheltic achievements are really a small part of the larger picture - his emotional and spiritual renaissance, a testimony (and inspiration) for any reader.	2001-07-31

Hmmm...makes one wonder just how &quot;time-tested&quot; these secrets are...and by whom....and how well they work on certain marriages. Call me a cynic if you want but I do think a book lacks credibility if one of the authors is no longer in a long-term (and lasting) marriage herself. And yes, I read the books. And yes, I hated it - even BEFORE I heard of the divorce. Let's just say I'm not surprised. The rules? Hogwash!	2001-07-22

The author also looks at the latest diet fads and reveals the myths behind the worst of them. The motivational messages are (no surprise) written from a &quot;business plan&quot; point of view but should work for those who need that daily affirmation of their &quot;game plan&quot; to keep them on track or for those who need a tough love approach to stay on track. The author's no nonsense, pull no punches style may be just the thing for some reluctant wanna-be fitness buffs. If that fits your profile, this is just the book for you.

This book actually explores far deeper subjects and questions such as : Why is it that so many successful family businesses fail when passed on to heirs? Why do so many solid companies with loyal customers, proven merchandise and a promising future just fall by the wayside?  To those who don't know Barneys, it was started by Barney Pressman, a smart, ambitious man who built his business into a thriving industry, selling more suits than anyone in the world by the 1960's.But what makes the book interesting is what happened to his business when his sons came into the picture and the intrigue, scandal and greed that tore apart the company. I can't help wondering: Why don't the patriarchs (or matriarchs) of family businesses teach their children to run the companies just as well? Is it possible to mix family and business and do it well?  The Barney's sage, of course, is not yet over and the store is still in existence. So the end of this story remains to be seen.	2001-07-20

Although his books are generally classified as &quot;murder&quot; or &quot;crime&quot; books (according to my local bookstore and library), I read them just as much for their close-up and often insightful take on modern life in the suburbs. Each book probes some new twist or development there and it is always fun to discover how Kit himself is trying to keep up with the ever-changing world of modern family and community life (not nearly as simple as it might sound).  This time around, Kit finds himself in the midst of a murder investigation involving an ex-husband and former member of a group called The Father's Club. His ex-wife wants to know who would kill her husband - and why. So Kit infiltrates The Father's Club and tries to figure out the whys of the murder, while also dealing with the challenges of being a stay at home father, chauffeur and homemaker (his wife is back in school full-time). Author Jon Katz is honest enough to let the fraying edges of Kit's life show through, the occasional resentments, stresses and challenges of being a stay at home parent with another job as well. I'd have given this book 5 stars except for the fact that I've read better from this particular author. You won't be disappointed if you read this one but I'd also suggest you seek out more from him. Also, if you enjoy reading mysteries starring detectives who are also parents, try picking up Ayelet Waldman's books, The Big Nap and Nursery Crimes.

She is writing instead of a brave, strong acceptance and commitment to marriage, which may also entail a surrendering of old myths and beliefs about romance, marriage and even personal fulfillment (if that fulfillment comes at the cost of the marriage and family). I enjoyed reading about her personal struggles as well as those of the couples she interviewed and found it refreshing that she was honest enough to admit that she once thought of marriage as a bad thing --- but no longer does. I found myself nodding my head in agreement with much of what she wrote and it certainly expanded my own view and reaffirmed my own belief that marriage, while imperfect, can also be deeply rewarding and fulfilling. Make no mistake- this isn't a book that glosses over the difficulties or the pain of marriage and it isn't a book that says staying married is easy (it often isn't, as most longtime spouses can attest). But it is a book that looks honestly at marriage and at couples from all walks of life and all levels of the commitment spectrum - from those who've hung in there to those who've left to build new lives - and at the challenges faced in those marriages. If you like books that tell it from a personal point of view and are also realistic and honest, this is a great read. If you're married, I'd say it should be at the top of your &quot;to read&quot; list. If you're considering divorce, read this one first. It may not change your mind but it will definitely help you to clarify your position and beliefs.	2001-07-17

I read this one in a single gulp and had a blast doing so. Author Ayelet Waldman has created a wonderful new sleuth in Juliet, a stay at home mom with a toddler, a woman dying to go back to work - until she becomes pregnant with her second child and her career plans are put on hold. Resigned to staying at home, Juliet is less than perfect on the domestic front, finding life with a toddler hard to take at times. As Juliet herself says, &quot; I wasn't any June Cleaver. I did all the things mothers aren't supposed to do. I yelled. I was sarcastic. I let her watch TV&quot;. Clearly, Juliet needs an outlet besides mothering.  Then Juliet's daughter, Rudy (&quot;half adorable..angel, half street urchin from hell&quot;) fails to ace the admissions interview at the Heart's Song school. Shortly afterwards, the principal of the school killed and Juliet has a new mission - she decides to solve the crime.  The details are what set this book apart from the average mystery - Juliet's frustration living among overly ambitious parents striving to get their toddlers into the best schools, her difficulty balancing her desire for a career with her decision to stay home and her humorous attempts to solve a crime without alienating every &quot;suspect&quot; ( in other words, she isn't the most tactful detective).  Waldman catches the subtle nuances of suburban life (albeit suburban Hollywood life) perfectly. I hope to see more from this new author and am looking forward to getting her next book, The Big Nap.	2001-07-13

This is that kind of book.  After I finished reading the last page, I had to go off alone and ponder this story - for hours. Then I had to reread the book, not just once but again. And again. Now, years after reading it, this one still haunts me and I think of it often. The story of a seemingly ordinary Mormon family who is caught up in a horror they don't even know is surrounding them was all too real to me - not because anything remotely like this has ever happened to me but beause the author made it so real, so vivid.  At first, it seems at thought Steve is just a young boy accompanying his family on a chaotic and stressful move to a new home and a town where his father can get work. But all is not what it seems and behind even the most innocent, everyday events, danger lurks... and boys are disappearing.  The climax of this books revolved around an event that seemed to me as if it could happen to anyone, to anyone's child. I know I'm being vague here but to say more would be to (possibly) kill the suspense of this one. Let me just say that I felt as if I'd entered this family's life and that when I finished this book, I was shaken to my core, seized by the urge to hold my son tight. This one has a permanent place on my bookshelf, cover facing out, and every time I see it, I am reminded not to take my blessings for granted.

I saw an interview with Malika Oufkir on Oprah Winfrey's show and was so taken by her courage, her incredible spiritual strength and the unbelievable horror of her tale, that I felt I had to know more. I found this version to be an inspiring testimony to the human spirit but also an honest account of the terrible toll of this family's ordeal, leaving one brother &quot;a permanent child&quot; in Malika's own words, a brother who found adjusting to a normal, free life nearly impossible and who is still suffering the effects of his imprisonment.For their part, Oufkir and her sisters were left suspicious of men, emotionally scarred by what they survived...and yet they also managed to find the strength to serve as witnesses to their injustice and to find the courage to speak out. This is one of the most inspiring true-life accounts I've read in the last year and one I'd put on any &quot;must read&quot; list. If you dont know the details of Oufkir's story, here's a brief summary: At the age of 5, Malika Oufkir, eldest daughter of General Oufkir, was adopted by King Muhammad V of Morocco, a man who wanted an available playmate for his young daughter. While in the palace, Oufkir led a life of a fairy princess, in total luxury --- until her father was found guilty of treason as part of a coup to overthrow the new regime (led by King Hassan II). Malika's father was executed and she, her mother and her brother and sisters were immediately imprisoned. From one day to the next, Oufkir went from luxury to a struggle for her very existence, living in conditions that you can't believe until you read about it. There were times when one or the other would try and commit suicide (her brother when he was only 7) or be forced to eat food drenched in rat urine. And yet they DID persevere and manage to escape to tell their tale. Please don't assume that the grim details in this book (and I won't pull any punches; there are parts of this book that are difficult to read0 take away from the inspiration to be found here. After finishing this book, I actually felt uplifted and was amazed that I did, buoyed by the fact that this family went through such horror and yet managed to find the courage to survive - and then to tell about it.inspiration to be found here.

The basic story involves San Francisco Homicide Inspector Jane Candiotti and her partner Kenny Marks, forced to take down a madman with revenge on his mind, a revenge he spent 15 years planning while locked away in prison. Although action, not character portrayal, is writer Clyde Phillips strong point, I did find Candiotti to be a compelling personality, a woman entering her 40's who is finally allowing herself to think of committing herself to a future that goes beyond her job (and involving, not so coincidentally, her partner, Kenny), a cop with a believable domestic side who loves to cook and decorate. Fellow cop Kenny Marks is equally compelling and figuring out who the killer is and what motivates him makes for an intriguing read - and a satisfying one.	2001-07-06

In the style of A Child Called It (the bestseller by Dave Peltzer), Orphan is told from the viewpoint of a child who endured nearly unspeakable horrors in a Florida orphanage and somehow emerged, spirit intact, to not only survive but tell his story with unflinchable honesty. The book is divided into three sections: Before, During and After,with the majority of the book (the During section) devoted to memories of the orphanage.<br /><br />With no one to love him and with repeated beatings, abuse and pain to love forward to, I find it nearly miraculous that the author, Roger Dean Kiser, Sr, actually managed to make a life for himself after enduring the indignities of orphanage life. His memoir reveals in vivid detail how orphans were seen as societal rejects and throwaways and treated as objects, not people. While he was often beaten severely till he passed out, Kiser emphasizes that \\"it is not the physical pain that endangers orphans the most. It is the mental pain caused by stress from years and years of being neglected, pushed aside, disregarded, unloved and made to feel undeserving...\\"<br /><br />I recommend this book as an eye-opening, inspiring read, I do wish there had been more detail in the After section of this book, the part that dealt with Kiser's life after he left the orphanage. This section seems rushed and abbreviated and there is little explanation of the life he made for himself as an adult - or how he got the courage to rise above his painful past to do so. He notes in the book's introduction that he has a wife, son and daughter-in-law and yet he doesn't note how he met his wife, how she felt about his past and if it affected his present life.<br /><br />After learning so much about his early life in the orphanage, I was left with plenty of unanswered questions like: How does a person who suffers so many blows to his self-esteen find the confidence to make a new life? Did he/does he suffer from painful flashbacks or memories today? Would he describe himself as happy or at peace now?e himself as happy or at peace now?	2001-07-06

I was particularly eager to read this one when I heard it was based in part on Mitchard's personal experience facing the possible loss of one of her adopted children - even though this child, an infant girl, was already living hin her home and even though Mitchard was permanently and indelibly bonded with this girl. This struck close to the bone, echoing some of my own concerns and fears as an adoptive mother.  While I wasn't crazy about Mitchard's previous novel (The Most Wanted), A Theory of Relativity shows that she is back in top form. When a couple dies in a car accident, Gordon (brother to the deceased wife) comes forth to adopt the surviving child, a one year old girl. Unfortunately, other family members feel differently and a custody battle ensues. While Gordon and his parents want to be the child's parents, the parents of the deceased husband want custody as well.  I was intrigued not only by the suspenseful plot but by the questions this book raised: What are the limits we, as a society, place on &quot;blood&quot; ties and those formed by adoption? Why are adopted children not always considered equal to those who are genetically related to their parents? How and why can families be torn apart by these distinctions?I found this to be a very believable story and couldn't help feeling that Mitchard's personal experiences brought a special ring of truth to this book. I'm looking forward to more powerful, emotionally honest novels from this wonderful writer in the future!	2001-06-23

He has managed to keep only the best - a sure sign of a gifted writer who knows what readers need to know -and who also knows that they don't need a lot of unnecessary padding of the facts. I couldn't put this one down, riveted by the story of Pablo Escobar, his beyond-the-boundaries, risky life and the final conclusion. I don't mean to be vague here but I absolutely HATE it when reviewers give away all the details of a book so I hope this whets your appetite for the rest.

I'm a bit disappointed in the other reader reviews I've seen here. After all, this is a FIRST novel by the author and I was amazed by the great writing in so much of this book, leaving me with a desire to read more books by Mr. Pyper, who I expect to get better and better as time goes on.  To be honest, this book has some of the flaws of a first book written by an author who needs more practice tightening and sharpening his sense of pacing and drama but even so, there is much to recommend here. The first chapter, where a young girl is dragged to the bottom of a lake by an inexplicable force, is truly gripping.  After that first chapter, there was some lack of tension here and there and things dragged a bit at time, but I still could NOT put this book down. There is an original voice at work here, one that deserves to be heard again and I, for one, am looking forward to reading another of this author's books in the future.	2001-06-16

When an ex-girlfriend pops up unexpectedly in Myron Bolitar's life, he is far from thrilled...at first. Then she reveals a secret that rocks his soul to the core and the story never drops its pace from then on. Coben writes as though he were in his characters' shoes and as if he truly sees (and understands) the world from their eyes.

Truly health weight loss is part of a total lifestyle change. For each dieter, the reasons for overeating will be a little bit different but Stop Stuffing Yourself is an excellent tool to help udnerstand and get in control of overeating. If the Weight Watchers point system is used along with this book and if a little exercise is added to daily activities, then weight loss success is likely. I've tried every diet out there and nothing works like the Weight Watchers program. It isn't a rigid diet but allows for real life situations, including eating at Fast Food restaurants and saving up food choices for special occasions. Stop stuffing Yourself proves that it is possible to eat well and feel comfortable without feeling too full OR feeling starved. Moderation does rule, when it comes to the weight loss game, at least for long-term, lasting results.	2001-06-07

The first section of this book is really a memoir of her transformation, one which was propelled into high gear when her mother died. She starts to yearn for family, become aware that there is more tho life than her career and even a marriage.  Then there is a section which many families struggling with infertility will identify with  - from an early pregnancy which results in a tubal pregnancy and miscarriage to unsuccessful (and costly) bouts of invitro fertilization, all written with often heartbreaking candor. Only gradually does adoption seem like a possible choice. The couple is still seeing fertility experts, in fact, when they attend an adoption seminar and fall in love with a little boy in a video.   Speaking as someone who has adopted an older child from overseas, I was glad to see a book on adoption which did NOT gloss over the risks, as well as the rewards, of international adoption. For instance, after seeing an early video of her son-to-be, the author is warned that he might be &quot;serverely delayed&quot; by some well-meaning friends, putting the adoption into crisis until a doctor looks at the video and offers some reassurance. Be assured this book does hava a happy ending, closing with a look at her young, happy and healthy son and his life today.   While other reviewers have criticized this author for disparaging Russia and Russians, I think it is to her credit that she portrayed her adoption saga from her own viewpoint and didn't flinch from honesty. The reality is that there CAN be delays and unexpected setbacks when adopting internationally. Ther reality is that many children DO have health issues or at least temporary developmental delays. The reality is that some Americans are thrown by life in Russia and have difficulty understanding the customs of that country. I am glad this author described her experience from a very personal viewpoint. Others may have a different experience and I hope that more books on overseas adoption are written, each as unique as the child who  was adopted - and the families who adopted that child.	2001-05-22

The first section of this book is really a memoir of her transformation, one which was propelled into high gear when her mother died. She starts to yearn for family, become aware that there is more tho life than her career and even a marriage.  Then there is a section which many families struggling with infertility will identify with  - from an early pregnancy which results in a tubal pregnancy and miscarriage to unsuccessful (and costly) bouts of invitro fertilization, all written with often heartbreaking candor.

Never preachy, he manages to gently urge the reader to look more closely at the local landmarks, wildlife and little details that make up their most familiar landscapes. I saw the landscape in my area with new eyes after reading this book.	2001-05-20

I know I did. Sure, I COULD videotape episodes and rewatch them (and I often did) but I found this book provided additional advantages. I could linger over certain phrases, note how well the script flowed in certain sections and gain a deeper understanding of why certain bits were funny. Plus, it was much easier rereading certain sections of this book than it would have been to rewind a tape, find the section and replay it. When it comes to television shows and comedic writing, books definitely have their advantages over videotapes. On the other hand, if you like to see how the characters interact, their facial expressions and mannerisms, you may still want to have a tape of each show, using this book as an excellent supplement to the tapes. If you have tapes AND this book of Seinfeld, I'd say you'd have a mini-course in good comedy writing.	2001-05-20

Instead, it is best used along with the more well-known college guides. What this one offers that those DON'T is a look at some schools which help students achieve their personal goals and which accept students who aren't necessarily academic whizzes. Ideally, college should help an individual student rise to his or her greatest potential and be a good fit for that student.  A good college should not overwhelm, intimidate or alienate a student.  In an effort to offer alternatives for students who don't feel like an Ivy League or larger institution fits their needs, this book suggest plenty of choices for high schoolers who may still be figuring out what they want and need in a college and who might be overwhelmed in larger, less personal institutions.	2001-05-20

Each manufacturer's designs are shown IN FULL COLOR (a definite plus) and you can even find examples of the same design on a different plate shape.  Having said that, it isn't as complete as I'd hoped, although it IS the most complete book I've come across. There are some pieces I have which I still haven't been able to ID and many of the designs simply have numbers, rather than names, to ID them.  Even with these flaws, this is a detailed, nicely done book. As most collectors of vintage dinnerware know, some information is simply hard to come by and it takes a great deal of research (and some luck) to get the information one would like. This book is a great aid along the way.	2001-05-18

There is so much to recommend about this mystery that I hesitate to mention any drawbacks. What I particularly loved about this particular book was the conflict between spiritual obedience and &quot;baser&quot; human temptations displayed by the inhabitants of St. Ansem's. The characters are vivid and the dialogue...well, you won't find better writing out there, for my money. In short, this book is topnotch. No character seems truly good nor purely evil.  But there was still a major drawback for me with this one. It often seemed as though the focus on the spiritual concerns of those at St. Anselms often seemed to preclude the need for some dramatic tension - and I sorely missed it in this book.  I hate it when the plot of a mystery is revealed beforehand but I will say that there are two major murders to be solved, including the death of an Archbishop and, of course, the murderer(s) and motive to be discovered. There's even romance afoot. Be forewarned, however, that this book may not be quite what you expect nor may it be as suspenseful and riveting as you'd prefer.	2001-05-15

I am an adoptive parent and it was most helpful to know of the author's experiences and helped prepare us for the risks  as well as the joys of adopting from overseas - such as delayed development of the children due to being raised in an orphanage, the difficulties in working with a child whose first language is not English, helping an orphanage child adapt to family life, etc. I wish there were more books out there which contain the personal experiences of adoptive parents, especially those who adopt older children (as we did).Otherwise, potential adoptive parents have to navigate through the maze of Web resources and links to find support and connection with others, especially if they live in small cities.	2001-05-08

As the parent of a Romanian adoptee who is doing well, I'd have to say that I think this book contains some significant flaws, perhaps even an overoptimistic belief in love and nuturing to make up for developmental delays caused by orphanage life. I think that many adoptive parents find they must also seek special services such as physical therapy and speech and hearing services for their children. Often they must be strong advocates to obtain proper ESL (English as a Second Language) services in their schools. We had to do all of the above. Having done so, I can say that our son is doing amazingly well. Even so, families considering the adoption of a child from Romania should be fully aware of the risks as well as the potential joys.  Having said all that, I still think this book is MUST reading. I searched the Web long and hard before adoption and found only a few scattered areas where there was much information or support, so I think adoptive parents (and those considering adopting from European areas) should read whatever they can get their hands on and find as many adoption groups and individuals to network with as possible. Along with this book, I'd recommend Come to the Window, Daniella - an account of a family's adoption of a little girl. It is far more honest and less optimistic than A Peacock Or a Crow. Both books together give a fairly well-rounded look at adoption and the issues involved.	2001-05-08

If you hate reading pages of useless information and are looking for a well-researched, tightly written guide for preparing for and celebrating a Bar or Bat Mitzvah, I doubt you'll find many books better than this one. In addition to the basics you'd expect to find (Planning, Budgeting, the Ceremony), there are also special sections on interfaith and divorced families, what questions to ask about preparation (what a timesaver!), lessons and tips from families and teens who have completed Bar/Bat Mitzvah ceremonies, making the Theme meaningful, whether or not to use a party planner, tips for families with special needs children and more.	2001-05-05

What makes this book so special? Robert McCloskey, author of Make Way for Ducklings, has the gift of knowing what children will find fascinating. In this book, Little Sal is separated from her mother while picking blueberries, accidentally follows a mother bear and thant's when chaos ensures. Meanwhile, the little bear is following Sal's mother.  But a mere plot summary does little justice to this book. What makes it a standout are the details, from the sights of a Maine morning to the sound of blueberries dropping into a pail, the peace and joy of being with one's mother and sharing a day together, adventures and all. The book also speaks to childhood fears and joys - being separated from one's mother (however briefly), being in a somewhat dangerous situation and having everything turn out all right.	2001-05-04

Be forewarned, however,  that you need to get through the first 4 chapters before this one weaves its spell (or at least, I did). I prefer books with strong characters and this book does have compelling characters  but the reader doesn't meet them immediately and I felt there were too many pages of background, information that could have been shortened and presented more tightly. Even so, there were many mysteries to puzzle through and that made for fun reading. The characters, once they DID appear, were fascinating.	2001-04-28

This book focuses on one man's decision to take a year and relive parts of his life that he still had regrets abut, major life experiences that he felt needed a &quot;second chance&quot; to get right. They're not always what you might think and range from Not Being Able to Find God to Never Having the Courage to Ask Her Out. My husband and I took turns reading chapters of this book out loud to each other and I am SO glad we did. Our favorite chapter was the one where the author decided to find his first car - and not just the same model but the EXACT same car, right down to matching Vehicle Identification Number!  My husband nodded his head in understanding and appreciation when he heard the first car was a silver 1979 Chevrolet Camaro Berlinetta and groaned in envy when we came to the section where the author tested the Camaro Z28, today's version of the Berlinetta. I was surprised, to say the least since my husband isn't exactly an auto buff. Other chapters range from the hilarious (learning to Surf) to the poignant (Never saying Goodby to My Dad). I guarantee that whether you are male or female, you'll love this one.	2001-04-28

Being a fan of this author's work, I was delighted to find this book of plays - and equally delighted to discover that he writes vivid, resonant plays. The themes are the usual ones for Price - love, sex, death and the variations of human relationships, written with his usual mix of compassion and poignancy. Containing a strong voice (often unmistakably a Southern voice), a great find for those who love drama as well as those who like southern writers. These plays fall into the &quot;storytelling&quot; tradition of drama, rather than those which are more modern, even surreal in tone.	2001-04-24

Jean is at a crisis in her marriage, at a point where the initial love has lessened and she is questioning her commitment to her husband - and his commitment to her.  Meanwhile, she is involved in researching a murder of the 1800's. As she does, she sees similarities between the lives of the murder victims, the murderer and her own life and marriage. Because the murder involved a love triangle, Jean looks more closely at her husband, every action he makes. Ultimately, she becomes suspicious of him. Is he having an affair?  I won't say more, won't give the plot away (I hate it when a reviewer does that) but I WILL say that what happens in this book is NOT what you might expect.  I would have given this book 5 stars except for few minor quibbles with it. I found the plot transitions a bit choppy and there were times when the story line dragged and I had the urge to skim ahead. Even so, I liked ths one so much that I immediately went out and bought the author's newest book THE LAST TIME THEY MET - in hardcover, to boot!	2001-04-21

I read this through in a few hours and found it entertaining enough but it isn't the type of book that will live with you much afterwards. I'd compare this one to watching an average movie. Well-written enough, with characters that you do care about, an intriguing murder (and murderer, for that matter). And yet it still fell short of what I expected, especially since I like Scottoline's books and always look forward to reading them. Maybe it was just me but somehow I didn't find the plot, action and characterization as compelling as other books she has written. Pigeon Tony, the elderly man who has murdered a long-hated enemy, is a sweet, lovable guy and you want him to get out of the murder rap (even though he DID murder the guy, which is no secret, that's clear from the start of this book) and his friends are also likeable. But this book dragged for me until the actual trial got going. There's a love angle, there's the murder, there is danger lurking around every corner - but all of these plot angles were not written in an unpredictable or intriquing enough manner for my taste. Having said that, please be aware that this book is far above the average for this genre and you might find you like it well enough. Like I said, my opinion is just that - a very personal one.	2001-04-19

As someone who reads every horse book I can, I can say that this one is a stand-out and could be enjoyed by nearly anyone, horse lover or not. It is filled with the kind of details that make a book come alive, - vivid portraits of horse owners, riders and those in the racing world, an intimate look at racing, vivid descriptions that make you feel as though you were actually in the saddle, little-known (and fascinating) facts. I thought I knew everything about Seabiscuit already, from having read about this horse from the time I was a child but this author proved me wrong. I'd recommend this book to anyone.

Her roles in Candida and Madame X are still remembered today but for some reason there seems to be little out there about her today (and if you know of more, please email me). I loved this book and NOT just because it was the only book I could find on this woman, but also because the photos, bibliography, chronology and index make a very well-rounded and researched publication. Well worth the expense, one of my favorite books about little-known, but fascinating, figures of the theatre world.	2001-04-18

I've rarely read a novel which looks so honestly at the realities of the racial views of those times, the ways blacks and whites were so separate and why. The often constrained life of women is also portrayed, the endless days with long stretches of time between chores and mealtime and nothing else to do. What is so amazing is how Reynolds Price can make a riveting tale out of such seemingly trivial material - and make the lives of these people reveal a view of the world that is both spiritual and real and absolutely believeable.  While the book is far from overwhelmingly gloomy, Price's description of the four year depression which Roxanna suffers at one point in the book is the most honest, unsentimental and yet vivid portrayal of depression I've encountered in a novel, one that those in the mental health professions would do well to read.  The real heart of this book lies in Roxanna, of course, and she is a woman both flawed and saintly. An unforgettable character, the kind that will be walking beside me in my thoughts for awhile.	2001-04-14

How would any of us react if someone we thought we knew well, a respected member of our community, suddenly beat his family to death with a baseball bat? And how would we react if we knew he'd remarried years later and started a new family? As riveting as these questions may be, they are only part of what made this book so fascinating to me. What made it unforgettable was how it made me think about the limits of love and forgiveness and how several families were put to the test in circumstances as horrendous as this.   Please be aware that this is NOT your usual true crime book, although it is based on true events and the writer does try to make sense of a crime most of us would consider senseless- the murder of 4 members of a family, the Rowes, by the husband/father of that family, a man considered by friends and neighbors to be a loving and attentive parent and spouse.   But it goes beyond the murder to give a riveting, detailed portrait of several families and how they lived both before and after this crime tore apart their community. These families had one thing in common - all of them had children with physical or emotional disabilities and the mothers in those families belonged to a support group. The author of this book, Julie Salamon, shows how each person was affected by the challenge of having a handicapped child and how they turned to the Rowes for guidance and inspiration. While some readers might find this part of the book irrelevant and even tedious, I did not. It  not only made me think about the unusual stresses faced by families who have children with special needs but it revealed the Rowe family through the eyes of those closest to them. The Rowes were seen as role models and ideals, a family that was dealing with their disabled son as best they could, even better than many others would.   The supposed stability of this family is what makes the murders so much more shocking and the author of this book doesn't hesitate to reveal the events leading up to the murder and the spiraling depression that overwhelms John Rowe.   But she doesn't stop there. She goes on to show his life after institutionalization, his remarriage and eventual death - and then the meeting of his 2nd wife and the women who'd been close to his first wife. Many of them are still angry, baffled and judgmental. I won't reveal the ending of this book to you but will say if you have the willingness to stick with this one, I think you'll find it will force you to think about grace and forgiveness in even the worst circumstances. I admit I'm not sure I don't understand a man like John Rowe but I'll never forget him or his family and I'll be thinking about this book and the issue it raised for a long time.	2001-04-11

It is just as much a book about the way we all classify the borders of safety and risk in our lives, walking that fine line everyday - and how a sudden decision can change everything. Rich and rewarding to read, I felt like I'd been shown parts of myself as well as those of the characters in this book. I absolutely loved reading this one!  Anna is a single mother, unquestionably devoted to her daughter, Lily, but also torn between the self-sacrifice required of parenthood and the equally strong need for adult pleasure, companionship, passion and love.  A pivotal moment occurs when Anna takes off rather suddenly on a trip to Europe - leaving her young daughter in the hands of trusted friends, Paul and Estella. When Anna doesn't return as expected, both friends become worried and then, in turn, more concerned and suspicious. Where is Anna? Is she safe? And could she possibly be a willing part of her own disappearance?  The book is written from several points of view - that of Paul and Estella and also that of Anna herself. As the days unfold, so do the events and the mystery deepens. Who is Anna meeting in Europe - and why? Who is the mysterious stranger Anna meets unexpectedly and what part will he play?  While I was drawn into this novel, potential readers should know that it can be a bit confusing and tricky to follow at times, as there are several subplots and the action isn't always sequential, jumping from one plot to another in the same day. I understood that this was done to deepen the various mysteries which were unfolding but some readers might find it more than a bit irritating and hard to follow. The mystery and intrique kept me going, however, and made it more than worth the effort. I'm looking forward to reading more books by this author.	2001-04-05

Every time I've read this one, something new jumps out at me, revealing new depths to the characters and events in this spare, tightly written book.  There is a strange sense of forboding from the very beginning of this novel, from the moment Sophie Bentwood is viciously bitten on the hand by a stray cat, a cat she has been feeding for days. Although the bite festers and swells, she denies the potential seriousness of the bite. Denial, in fact, is the way both Sophie and her husband, Otto, seem to face many events in their life, from the emptiness of being in a childless marriage, the odd purposelessness of much of their life and even Otto's recent estrangement with his business partner.  While I suppose this book could be seen as the portrait of a marriage, it was far, far more than that to me. Paula Fox writes books for both readers and writers, with prose that is both eloquent and spare and with a sense of time and place that is unique and special, filled with small gems of description, vivid and revealing. For an enlightening look at the world AND for pure reading pleasure, she can't be beat!	2001-03-31

But the author of this book, Martha To Dudman, has a daughter who goes beyond even the extreme highs and lows of many teens. She is truly in trouble, deep in emotional pain and taking out much of her frustration and anger on her mother.  There is one paragraph in this book which struck home to me and echoed my own fears and worries (and probably that of most parents) when their teen is particularly emotional or upset: &quot;When your daughter is eleven, when your daughter starts to act different, you don't know if it is because her parents are divorced. You don't know if it's because her mother works too much, or because your daughter's too smart for her classes, or because she has maybe a learning disability you never caught, or because her teacher...isn't smart enough to teach your daughter. Or maybe it doesn't have anything to do with school at all. Maybe she is becoming a teenager and this is how they act. Maybe they are supposed to be quiet like this and stay up in their rooms.&quot;  Honesty like this runs through this book, the kind of gut-felt honesty that speaks from the heart- and reached the heart of this reader. I'd say this one is a MUST for parents of teenagers, highly recommended for anyone else as well.	2001-03-31

Kercheval moved to Florida as a child and found it an exotic place at first, with the endless vistas of sand and sea and the pastel colored houses. But there was a darker side to life in Florida, including a mother who began to fade away emotionally, getting lost in her own emotional darkness, an older sister who was forced to assume her mother's responsibilities and a father who couldn't face his wife's illness.  Although I'm sure many readers will nod their heads in recognition of the major events (the Space Race, President Kennedy, the public fascination with Jacqueline Kennedy) which Kercheval recounts from that period, she also reveals the unique, often funny, sometimes heartbreaking, life in her family. She writes so vividly and so well that I didn't want this book to end.  I felt close to each member of her family, flaws and all. But mostly I felt entranced by the special world Kercheval brought to life.	2001-03-30

I urge you NOT to read this book or support it in any way. I bought a copy of this eagerly, hoping for a realistic portrayal of a family struggling with a difficult child, a child possibly scarred and traumatized from being reared in an orphanage before adoption.  I was prepared for an unhappy ending (and I won't reveal how this book ends). However, I was NOT prepared for a book which perpetuated gross stereotypes of adoptive children, seemingly ungrounded in fact or research.  Before adopting, we did our research and I DO know the risks and realities of adopting a child from another country, especially older children. I DO know the signs of attachment disorder and institutionalized behavior. Happily, our son was one of the fortunate who didn't have serious difficulties. I know some children, a minority, do have serious difficulties and thought this book would focus on one of them.  But that was not the case. None of the actual risks and realities are handled well in this book. Instead, the author has portrayed at least 2 adopted children as little monsters, unredeemable and apparently unlovable. What is most mystifying is that the behavior she describes is not even that awful - a child who gets in fights at school, who throws a rock which hits his sister in the forehead ( while not behavior I'd condone, has no &quot;normal&quot; child has ever made a mistake like this in a moment of anger?).  I do hope this book doesn't serve to perpetuate a bias against older adoptive children - especially those from other countries. I can't help thinking of the many children who languish in orphanages overseas, of the countries filled with citizens too poor to adopt and whose children will continue to remain in institutions. How horrid that this author may have done her part to make the situation worse, to close people's minds to adopting one of these children. Shame on her.	2001-03-28

Is it guilt? Is there something about the priveliged lifestyle that makes these women crave something spiritual?  Goldman shows that the answers aren't the ones that automatically come to mind, affected by early family experiences, vulnerability and a lack of solid identity - and even such subtle factors as where they live. I read this one in a single day, as I found it that compelling and helped me to understand why people I knew had joined cults.	2001-03-23

Dominick, torn between his loyalty to his mother and his unexpected, but strong passion for Edie, makes some decisions that result in heartbbreak for those around him. The resentment and anger he feels toward his father, who runs off for days at a time, goes on drinking binges and is unfaithful to his wife, is so well-written that it was painful to read at points, almost too realistic, if that is possible.  If this book sounds a bit soap opera-ish, believe me, it isn't. The author has a way of making the reader feel that Dominick's conflicting feelings are understandable and that he can feel both love for his mother and a yearning for Edie Kramer, who is sexy and seductive, and whose passionate nature excudes a strong power over a young boy. And Edie doesn't hesitate to use her allure to her advantage, when she realizes Dominick is attracted to her.  I have one criticism of this book. I wish the author had made the book even longer, added more detail about Dominick's emotions and those of his mother, father and others. I did feel as though there were several parts in the book where there would be a sudden decision or crisis without the actions or descriptions that made these fully understandable. Perhaps this was intentional but I still would have liked even more detail than provided.  Even so, this is a strong debut novel by a talented writer. The contrast between Edie Kramer and Dominick's mother, their different personalities, attitudes towards life and family, was fascinating to me. Dominick, too, is a compelling person, a teen trying to make a place for himself in spite of a difficult and challenging life. His pain and yearnings are palpable and I think you'll find yourself rooting for him - as I did.	2001-03-23

First off, I admit I'm a fan of Angela Huth's books and I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. I wasn't dissappointed. This is a sometimes comic, sometimes poignant glimpse at the life of a couple, William and Grace, whose marriage has gotten a bit too routine.  And then a lovely young musician enters the picture, a musician who happens to be joining William's music quartet,taking the place of a viola player who has resigned. William is entranced by her. Meanwhile Grace herself is not sitting alone, bereft and rejected. Although she's unaware of her husband's passions for another woman, Grace is also feeling drawn to another man. If you think this story is going to move along in predictable ways, think again - there's another horror around the corner, one this couple can't anticipate. I hope I've perked your interest in this book - I'd love to think another reader has discovered the joys of this author's writing.	2001-03-21

If you don't keep Kosher, the definitions may not mean that much to you and you may be pleased to find plenty of low-fat recipes which have roots in Jewish cooking and meals - including many you can use for special holidays, with full menus. The recipes are indeed tasty, although there are times you can tell that the fat is missing. The &quot;mouth appeal&quot; isn't quite the same, as they say in the food business. Still, if you're watching your fat content and you are looking for traditional foods that are tasty, this book will do nicely. I LOVED the spicy Turkey burgers with Cumin, coriander and cilantro - I made it both with and without the Cilantro (we have a Cilantro hater in our family) and it was still quite good.	2001-03-20

This true account of Raoul Wallenberg, a man who saved more than 100,000 Jewish men, women and children from extinction during the Holocaust, is gripping and well-written. My kids could NOT put it down and one of them is a reluctant reader, so that says a lot right there. Watching my reluctant reader with his eyes glued to the page compelled me to pick up the book myself and I was glad I did.  The author has used actual archival materals and even interviewed Wallenberg's family and friends. There are also photographs included, a special touch that brings a sense of immediacy to the past. Perhaps most importantly, the author has not &quot;talked down&quot; to the older children who are most likely to read this book (although it could be read aloud to younger ones). Adults, too, would find this one fascinating to read. A strong recommendation for this one!	2001-03-19

Farley Mowat is the kind of writer whose words flow across the page as easily as breathing - and what a delight those words are! I've never sailed, I'm not a boat lover and yet I could not put down this true tale of one man's adventures getting a primitive vessel into seaworthy shape. Several pages had me laughing out loud, especially Mowat's account of drinking Screech, an alcoholic beverage of near deadly strength.While this book is classified as a &quot;children's&quot; book, I think it is far more suitable for adults, who may appreciate some of the humor here with an adult's perspective. Then again, if you have a reluctant reader, I can't think of a better book to keep him or her reading. I guess this book is actually for the WHOLE family.	2001-03-17

I particularly like the fact that the author has focused the book around a woman who has suffered from depression and even outright psychosis at certain points in her life. And yet she doesn't seem frightening or weird but simply as a person who is doing her best in spite of the challenges she faces, both emotional and otherwise.  This woman, Rae Newborn, has had a difficult life. Her periodic depressions, breaks with reality and unpredictable behavior have left her realtionship with her daughter (the product of an early marriage) severely strained. She has a son-in-law who is equally unloving and on the verge of keeping her grand-daughter from her, a girl Rae loves dearly. And there have been other troubles, deep ones, in Rae's life - crises I won't reveal here (not wanting to spoil the story). The past and recent pains in Rae's life have left her shell-shocked and fearful.  Still, she's a resilient woman and she decides the best way to cure her pain is to confront it head on, with no one to turn to for support except herself. She moves to an island and decides to build a home which was started by another member of her family, long ago.  And that's when things come to a climax - although it's a climax that builds gradually, allowing the reader to get to know Rae and her past more fully. I found this to be an extremely satisfying read, one that left me feelng as if I knew Rae quite well. I also liked the fact that the author did a fine job of demystifying mental illness. I felt drawn to Rae, to her courage and her willingness to take huge risks to become the person she wanted to be.	2001-03-17

It is clear that Clara Claiborne Park, the mother of Jessy Park, has also tried to understand her daughter's perceptions of the world, at least as much as any non-autistic person can, and to reveal that world to &quot;outsiders&quot; (those with no first-hand experience being with an autistic person). She has done an admirable job. I've read quite a bit about autism and autistic children and this book ranks among the best. In addition to her own feelings, Jessy's mother uses Jessy's own quotations and poems to try and help others understand her daughter's world.  Like another relatively well-knonw autistic, Temple Grandin, Jessy is a &quot;high-functioning&quot; autistic. She can hold down a job, she has had art exhibitions of her drawings and she attended school for many years. Still, her world is far from what most of us would call normal and her social interactions with people outside her family are still rather limited. She has trouble with unexpected changes in her usual routine and she has never fallen in love, at least not with another person. She sees the world in minute detail in some areas, creating drawings that are extemely precise and accurate, and yet fails to grasp the subtle nuances of social give and take, the emotional vocabulary so many of us take for granted.  What I found particularly fascinating about this book was the way it changed my perspective about what normalcy is. If you read this book, would strongly recommend getting a look at Jessy's drawings wometime, whether at an exhibition or however else you may find them (perhaps searching down that back issue of Harpers; wish I remembered the issue off the top of my head). Her drawings of routine objects, particularly houses, are striking for their attention to detail and a shimmering vibrant sense of color that goes beyond simple copying of what is in front of her eyes.  I wish I could see the world as she does for just one day, not because it would be better than the way I see the world now, not because I have any romantic illusions that the autistic leads a charmed life (no one reading this book could feel that way) but because I would like to know what that world was like, in all its beauty, pain and alienation.r that goes beyond simple copying of what is in front of her eyes.

Then again, maybe not. The heroine of this book , Rebecca, reminded me, oddly enough, of Winnie the Pooh, if Pooh had been set loose in a store - and if Pooh had found shopping as delightful as consuming a large pot of honey. Rebecca approaches stores the way Pooh approached a tree full of honey, ignoring the &quot;buzzing bees&quot; of guilt in her mind and the financial pitfalls and consequences of buying the most expensive, luxurious items. She has a sheer delight, even an innocent, naive delight in the sounds and sensations of shopping malls and unique little stores and can rationalize her way through even the most frivolous purchases, managing to ignore the creditors and bank managers who hound her for payments and (literally) show up on her doorstep.  The real irony in this tale is that Rebecca is a financial writer who actually understands much of the world she writes about. But, just like the perpetual dieter who gains weight while being able to recite the calorie count for every food out there, Rebecca has a hard time applying the financial wisdom she writes about. One of the funniest parts of this book is when she puts herself on a strict budget - and immediately buys the nicest notebook and other items to keep track of her(decreasing) finances.  The book is far from predictable, although I found it to be a quick read, a very enjoyable one. I'm sure many a reader will recognize himself/herself in this book, especially those of us who do like to shop.	2001-03-11

I've read the book and I've seen the movie. The book has its flaws, as many reader reviewers below have noted, but I found it an extremely powerful book. Perhaps this is because my religious background is Judaism and so the Catholic church and the beliefs of its members were fresh and new to me - as they might not be to some readers.  Beyond that, however, I found the story of a man's search for faith to be quite moving and believable - and his desire to find out if a true miracle had occurred or not was also compelling. No matter one's religious tradition or beliefs, the desire to find spiritual truths is a universal one and the book is worthy of being put on anyone's reading list.  Now, as to the movie - Ed Harris is one of my favorite actors and I found his portrayal of a priest in crisis to be a poignant one. This movie is NOT, however, for those who are easily offended by priests who act in less than ideal ways - and who has some very human failings. Be forewarned. I'd suggest you read the book and then see the movie. The is available on VHS and you can come across pre-viewed copies fairly regularly.	2001-03-09

As a dramatist who often gets inspiration from the pulse of society and who sees theater as having a therapeutic effect on social problems, Van Italie is a fascinating figure. I'd like to find more about this writer/playwright. The book only whetted my appetite for more.	2001-03-08

With a 16 year old son in our house, I've not only been fighting the &quot;brand name bullies&quot; outside our home but the teenaged one INSIDE our home as well. So it was a no-brainer for me to buy and read this book. I won't say it was an easy read. But the information contained within it was worth the time spent. More importantly, I left the book lying in a spot where my son was sure to see it and was gratified when he picked it up and read parts of it. Now he has loosened his rigid stance on having only the &quot;coolest&quot; clothes with the &quot;best&quot; logos on them and started to realize that his individuality was being manipulated to some degree by advertisers. He's started talking to his friend about the book too.  Having said that, I don't want ANYONE to think this book doesn't have its flaws. There is repetition of some subjects that have already been discussed ad nauseum in the media already - advertising in the public schools via educational channels and other subjects. But there is also plenty of new information and Klein makes her case with solid, clear arguments.	2001-03-08

If you like Southern novels, you won't want to miss this one. Miss Julia absolutely seemed real, quirky, obstinate but also...at the beginning of the novel, at least... more than a bit naive. Married to a &quot;pillar&quot; of the community, a man with an impeccable reputation, Miss Julia has lived quite a contented, if somewhat restricted life, enjoying the luster of her husband's reputation and place in the community. This life came with a cost, however, as her husband controlled nearly every aspect of their life.  When he suddenly dies, she is looking forward to some freedom, when she suddenly is faced with a major crisis. It seems that the man she thought she knew so well had a secret life and a child with another woman. Even worse, the child is deposited on her doorstep by his destitute mother, leaving Miss Juila not only in shock but with a nine year old child to deal with.  From this beginning, the writer creates a funny, heartwarming and very engaging story of a woman who has to deal with the unexpected and with advice from her &quot;friends&quot; and even her minister (who is more than a bit self-interested) about how to handle her finances and her life. But what is most appealing about this book (besides the wonderful character, Miss Julia) is the very unique voice and writing style of the author.	2001-03-07

When the Jewish partners in the marriage were taken away by the Germans, the remaining spouses reacted angrily, culminating in the Rosenstrasse protest of February 1943. This book is a very detailed and powerful look at the heart of a nation - and its peoples. The author interviewed survivors and looked at literally thousands of Nazi records that had never before been examined. I found this book to be very inspiring and couldn't help wondering: what if more people had protested the injustices of Hitler's regime even earlier- could the Holocaust actually have been prevented?	2001-03-06

When you find a book that contains both, you often find a gem - and this book is that gem. There is a wide range of material here, everything from Songs about Cowboys to Other Songs Cowboys Sing (including the most bawdy and less well-known pieces). Gives a well-rounded view of the cowboy's real life, not the prettified picture that many books contain. The author, Guy Logsdon, lectures and performs as a Cowboy Poet and Singer and has published  widely on cowboy songs and poetry. An extensive glossary and bibliography are included in the book.	2001-03-05

The question above is one of many in this book - the question of Jewish identity and whether an individual can actually be fully Jewish without a sense of community and affiliation with others. Three main areas of Jewish identity are explored: Unaffiliated Jews, Jewish Community and New, even radical directions in Jewish practice and identity. Because there were many 1st person accounts, this book was lively and interesting to read. It raised questions in my own mind about what it means to be a Jew in America today. Fascinating!	2001-03-02

Forget Balduccis and other places with fancy prices and less than superb food - get this and wow your friends and family without knocking yourself out - or hurting your budget.  I have already tested several of these recipes and they are superb! Full-color photos of every recipe on every page and great directions. These are the real thing, too, everyday cooking (as well as fancier, more expensive recipes if you like) for true culinary feasts, Italian style. All the pasta dishes you'd expect, plus a wealth of seafood recipes - from seafood marinara to calimari. There's even a recipe for Duck Casserole which I'd like to try soon. If you find a copy, you'll probably pay a pretty penny, but you won't regret it. Worth every penny I've paid and I'd gladly pay double the price for this one!	2001-03-02

But if you are looking for entertainment, want to learn a bit about Europe and are prepared to laugh uproariously, this is a great choice. Bryson skewers the traditions and habits of other countries, recounts many hilarious experiences during his travels and describes some of the best (and worst) destinations in Europe. He has a fine writing style, casual, breezy and unique. The section on waiting for The Northern Lights to appear - and waiting and waiting for days on end - was worth the price of the book alone.	2001-03-01

I'm used to sinking into a Jane Hamilton novel and getting lost in a believable world and I didn't really feel that way about this book. I liked the fact that the story was  narrated by the teenage son in the family and he was an engaging fellow. But other characters left me disinterested and the family dynamucs didn't quite ring true to me. I felt as though certain plot developments were there simply because they were timely - Civil War re-enactments,an affair cemented with online love letters and communication, etc. If you're a fan of Jane Hamilton's writing, you may still want to read this one and add it to your collection. Other readers might want to pass this one up.	2001-02-28

One of my favorite books, far more than just a memoir written by a food writer. Absolutely delightful, full of humor and charm ( and a few great recipes), this is the story of an amazing woman who was born into a chaotic family and managed to break away and find her own identity. Ruth Reichl's mother was an unpredictable woman who literally left chaos in her wake - she was later diagnosed as a manic-depressive. What's more,  she was a terrible cook, often preparing not just inedible meals but many that were actually dangerous to eat; she was rather absent-minded about food storage.  Instead of being discouraged by the chaos in her life, Reichl learned to cook - probably as much for her own survival as anything else and eventually became a celebrated food writer.  But all I've said so far is really a bare-bones sketch of a remarkable book. I was amazed by the life Reichl led and the  way she managed to find a path for herself and build a life in spite of a tumultuous childhood.	2001-02-24

If you're looking for a quick escape, lots of action or a strong romance, this is not the book you want. However, if you enjoy books that aren't your usual fare and are strong on psychological tension, this is an excellent choice. I absolutely loved this story of an elderly woman, a rather judgmental, cantankerous person. I like novels that show how a person grows and changes and I find slow change to be most believable and true to life, as it is in this book. Many readers may have found Hagar Shipley's life to be rather mundane, even dull. But I didn't - her marriage to a man she eventually saw as inferior and coarse, her relationship with her children, her desire to make a proper home and better herself - were all quite realistic to me. As she becomes increasingly frail and dependent on her son and daughter-in-law, she also comes to see her life in a different way. I won't reveal more but I do urge you to read this one and stick with it. Odds are, you'll want to read more by the gifted author, Margaret Laurence.	2001-02-24

With a close relative fighting breast cancer, I've bought and read a number of books out there. This is by far the BEST I've come acroos and the ONLY one that honestly discusses the realities of breast disease. Most of the books I came across were either vague or didn't go into detail about the realities of advanced breast cancer, perhaps trying to remain upbeat. What I wanted was real information and this book filled the bill, whle also containing impeccable research and plenty of personal experiences and stories. Not a doom-and-gloom book by any means, it contains its fair share of survival stories but also presents the information that patients and families need to cope with breast cancer, find appopriate treatment, deal with side effects and get on with living as full a life as possible at every step. There is also a list of orgnanizational web sites, extensive bibliography,resources, areas to find financial assistance and more. If you want riveting tales of actual cancer patients AS WELL AS solid information, this is the book you want. I'd recommend this one before any other.	2001-02-22

A poignant, true-life story of a woman ahead of her time, willing to risk her life and put herself in danger to save Jewish refugees.

The author, Nechama Tec, looks at people who helped for all the right reasons - and also those who helped in spite of their semitism. She tries to find the &quot;why&quot; behind all the altruism and also explores how class and politics affected the decision to help the Jews. I found the writing style to be a bit dry for my taste at times but I still couldn't stop reading this book. Recommended!	2001-02-21

I also recommend the video if and when you can get a copy (some video stores have previewed copies on sale or Amazon's zhops and auctions occasionally have some) as it is an incredibly well-acted and moving story.

It has everything I look for in a good collector's book - a wealth of full-color photos on every page, all of decent size and many even larger than one would expect. The variety of items represented covers the range from toys, games, books and banks to advertising, music, Golliwoggs, cards, flat art, household items, clocks, watches and more. There is a basic, if not overly detailed, price guide and a fair amount of historical information. Unless the reader is already an expert  in the history and value of Black collectibles, I'd say there  will be plenty of new information here. It was a delight just looking through this one- although, as expected, some of the collectibles may be seen as offensive to contemporary eyes (or one would hope), representing a view of Black Americans that was taken for granted when the items were made.	2001-02-21

I nearly put it down several times but felt compelled to finish it, if only to give a fair review of the book.  On the other hand, please, please pick up and read The Quiet Game by the same author. It has the heart and soul that 24 Hours lacks and you may well be amazed, as I was, that this book was written by the same author. Skillfully blending southern politics and scandal, a bit or romance and riveting action and suspense into one seamless tales, this is a book you'll truly enjoy.

What's more, the author seems to be saying, sometimes there is value in simply listening to grief and learning from it.  I don't mean to imply that Levy always has a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach to grief, however. As a former rabbi for a Conservative congregation on the West Coast, her advice is solidly grounded in Jewish values and each section ends with a heartfelt prayer, lending perspective to her words. She also gives numberous examples of how individuals handled the most difficult losses one can face, from seeing family perish in the Holocaust to losing a child or spouse. This is an inspirational, warm and very engaging book.	2001-02-20

Maybe the problem was that I was looking for so more more than a romance story with a mystery thrown in. Plus I found it totally unbelievable that a chance meeting would result in a writing assigment for thousands of dollars (as a former freelance writer, I KNOW how hard those assignments are to come by). But those are really minor quibbles. There are some things going for this book - a heroine who is far from perfect, some details that are unique and interesting and above the trite plots of many romances.

If you read 24 Hours before this book, you might well think you're reading books by two different authors. I was totally riveted by this book, which not only had a great mystery at the center of it, but managed to combine southern politics and scandal, history and a bit of romance into an intrguing book with non-stop suspense and action. I nearly didn't read this one, however, after first reading another book by this author, 24 Hours. That one was a waste of time and money, to my mind, seeming half-hearted and glib. The Quiet Game had the heart and soul of a passionate writer with a special, resonant voice. Highly recommended for fans of mysteries and southern literature.	2001-02-20

Much of the book is devoted to pages of fine art examples and only a portion of the book shows actual rooms and ways to display artwork. You won't find ANY examples of contemporary or modern rooms or ways of displaying pictures in those rooms. However, if you'd like to see some of the finest examples of various subjects for pictures, such as dogd, architectural pictures, portraits, etc..and if you're fond of English decorating styles and traditions, you may want to take a look at this one.	2001-02-19

Not only is the story of a young widow joining an Orthodox community in the South a unique and compelling one but the traditions and values of the Jewish community were intriquing and interesting to read about.  The book revolves around a young widow and her young daughter who have moved to Memphis to begin a new life in a neighborhood where all the Orthodox Jews have known each other for years and years. The arrival of the new woman starts tongues wagging and the other women in the community are particularly intrigued by her rather unique ways of behaving - she manages to remain just within the acceptable boundaries of Orthodox Judaism but barely so. She wasn't raised as an Orthodox Jew but converted before her marriage. Even so, her fervor and passion are actually stronger than many of the women who were born and raised in the Orthodox tradition and they often fall short of her whole-hearted adherence and faithfulness to this way of life.  There is a great deal of humor in this book and it is clear that the author is familiar with the lifestyle of Orthodox Jews living in the South, from the women's use of, &quot;Shalom, Y'all&quot; to their frequent discomfort with wearing the traditional long skirts and full-sleeved blouses in the heat.  I look forward to reading more of this author's books in the future. This had some of the stiffness and erratic flow of a first novel but even so I found it to be a fascinating book to read.	2001-02-19

Consider this- viewers could find such greats as Lucille Ball (has there ever been a female comedian to compare to her?), Milton Berle, Jackie Gleason and others. There was also live drama being shown and not just ANY drama but that showcasing such writers as Gore Vidal and Rod Serling, who often had to create strong stories to hold audience attention while conforming to the censors of the time.  After reading this book, perhaps you'll decide (as I did) that it is no accident that there have been a wealth of movie remakes of some of these classic shows. How ironic that we have more stations available via cable and satellite than ever and yet are often hard pressed to find the quality of shows available in the 50's.	2001-02-17

Some of the most original writers of the 80's amd 90's are represented here, from Gary Indiana to Donna Wyszomierski. Readers should be forewarned that some of these selection are excerpts rather than the full stories, and for that reason I do feel compelled to give this one only 3 stars but writers or readers looking for examples of some of the most innovative and original writing out there should have a look at this one.	2001-02-15

Books like this truly aren't written anymore, probably because it takes a special writer with the imagination and creative vision to believe that children CAN understand these little stories - and to be enriched by them. Not all of these pieces are immediately understandable, at least on a purely logical level, but they ARE intuitively and emotionally understandable, piecees like: &quot;There was a kitten. And there was a lion. And the lion chased the kitten and the kitten ran. She ran into the woods and dug a hole for the lion to fall in. ...The Indians came and shot arrows in him. And they killed him. Then they shot arrows in all the lions on the world. They killed all the lions in the world...there n3ever were more lions Evermore. But there are still tigers. &quot; Ah, the joy of this book!	2001-02-15

Many of these pieces have been long out of print, making them a special delight to find here. Ranging from Horgan's descriptions fo the hstory and landscape surrounding the Rio Grande to visits with Stravinsky, this is a complex, rich book. He makes history come alive, recreating the lives and souls of the people who lived before us.	2001-02-15

This book has some very minor flaws but I still had to give it 5 stars and here's why: This is one of those rare books that is so well-written and so engrossing that it is impossible to put down. I absolutely hated to finish it.  At the heart of the book, is the murder of 2 babies, who may or may not be related and the trial of a woman who may be falsely accused, even though the evidence seems to point to her as the murderer.  Behind the main story, however, are the kinds of details that make a book truly come alive, revealing deeper and deeper layers of complexity and mystery as the story unfolds. There is so much here to hold the reader - the descriptions of small town life, characters which are not stereotypical, portrayals of women searching for their identity in the rather constricted community they inhabit. Finally, there is the story itself, which is gripping, intriguing and horrifying. One of my favorite books of the year!	2001-02-04

If you love books where you feel you've entered a believable world with vivid characters (and you like a good love story as well) this is a book that shouldn't be missed. Although the characters in this one are what most would consider &quot;ordinary&quot;, the kind of people that are almost invisible due to their plain exteriors and apparently dull lives, the reality is astounding, breathtaking. Few writers can capture so realistically the kind of passion and compelling emotions of seemingly plain folk as well as Brown has done. This is the kind of book that changes one's view of the world, so be forewarned and be prepared to be inspired, to laugh, to cry - in short, to experience everything a good book should be!	2000-11-29

If you think you don't like &quot;horror&quot; or &quot;supernatural&quot; books, read the first 8 pages of this book. If you can put it down after that, you've got more willpower than I did. But DON'T start reading this one unless you're willing to read it all. You will not want to put it down. The characters, the story and the suspense (who ARE the walking? Why are they acting as they do?) will keep you riveted to every page. Little is an absolute master of the genre, who has even gotten raves from Stephen King (no slouch himself).	2000-11-18

If you know anything about David Mamet, you know he is a unique writer...and this book is no exception. Although it is titled Bar Mitzvah, it isn't the usual tale, moving from watchmaking through the Holocaust. This may sound unappealing but the main theme, what it means to be a Jew and to live a meaningful life, shine through. A gorgeous book, one I strongly feel will appreciate in value, heirloom quality. The drawings by Donald Sultan compliment the text nicely.	2000-11-17

I particularly liked the pages containing copies of actual advertising brochures and stock lists.

There are several things that make this book a stand-out. The first is the basic information about the types of marbles (antique, machine-made, modern) and the makers of the marbles. If you're looking for extensive historical information, this may not be the book for you. But if you collect marbles and are interested in good, basic information as well as tons of photos (most enlarged so you can see every detail) of a wide variety of marbles, this book fills the bill. While I'm no marble expert, I learned a grat deal from reading this one!	2000-10-19

This book is an excellent resource for those interested in increasing their knowledge of calligraphy styles. WHat is particularly interesting about this book is the fact that the leters are very true to Mercator's original letters because he cut his own printing blocks. The swooping letters, very elegant, are organic in form, not harsh or rigid. All the designs, by the way, are copyright free - a nice bonus.	2000-10-15

Deford somehow manages to show how devasting cystic fibrosis was to his daughter, how it sapped her energy and stole so much normalcy from her life. At the same time, he shows how Alex Deford's spirit remained shining so much of the time, serving as an inspiration to those who loved her and who were forced to bear witness as the disease invaded her body.  This book pierced my heart and soul and showed me the power of Alex's spirit - and the enduring love of her father. Few writers are as riveting to read as Frank  Deford.	2000-10-02

I find that the best inspirational tales come from real life - and this book is no exception. I saw the owner of Willy (yes, there actually is a real Willy) on Animal Planet and knew I just had to buy the book. It is as charming as expected and not just because of spunky little Willy, whose back legs are paralyzed and who has to learn to &quot;walk&quot; again, with the help of a special wheel-cart. It is just as inspiring to read of his owner's attempts to find a way to get him walking - using everything from acupuncture to helium balloons to hold up the back legs. A great read for the entire family!	2000-10-02

Devastated by his grief, he is tormented by a feeling of meaninglessness and no will to live...until a survivor(?) from the crash appears, with a little girl in tow.  This one is for anyone who has ever wondered about life's meaning and what is in store for us after we die. While you may not get THE answer...in capital letters...or even a full theory about life's ultimate meaning or life after death, what you DO get is a riveting book that tugs at the heart. This one grabbed me from the start and never let go. I'm not a fan of otherworldly or horror type books, so this is really saying something.	2000-10-01

Richly illustrated with period photographs, this memoir is a lovely addition to autobiographical books about life in the 1800s. Written by William Graham, a traveling Methodist preacher who eventually settled in Indiana, the book is filled with the kind of details that make history come alive. Graham traveled on Horseback and sometimes by buggy and on one occasion he writes &quot; I was run into by a drunken farmer in a wagon, had my buggy broken up and a good horse ruined, and was in danger of being killed.&quot; Anecdotes like these help to flesh out the lines of life in a time far different from ours.

High points of the book include vintage photos and passages such as these, where Massine, while dancing, gives insight into the creative process of ballet: &quot;I felt instinctively that something more than perfect technique was needed here, but it was not until I had worked myself up into a frenzy that I was able to transcent my usual limitations. I felt an almost electrical interaction between myself and the spectators....until I was dancing with a sustained force that seemed far beyond my reach at other times.&quot;	2000-09-25

This book fits the bill, telling the story of Schweitzer's  accomplishments as a physician, spriitual leader and, most importantly, his  efforts to help the people of West Africa who most needed his help.

I first became acquainted with Frank Deford's writing when I read his book Alex: The Life of a Child. This book is among the best books I have ever read, reverberating not only with personal honesty and passion but written  with all the love of a father for the daughter he is losing. There doesn't  seem to be a false note anywhere in this book. I have re-read this book  many, many times.<br /><br />It was this book which motivated me to read every book  and column of Deford's I could get my hands on. Some of his best sports pieces are indeed  in the book but it is an uneven mix.<br /><br />Writing the way he does \\" at the top of his game\\" is  a gift, an art, and reading his words often leaves me feeling transfixed,  enlightened and emotionally moved.

Lowerre tells how her romantic expectations of life in Africa contrasted with the reality she  soon encountered- the heat, the hard life and even the parasites that  invaded her body. Even so, she finds herself becoming attached to the  people she lives among, to the country and a life that is far different  than the one she expected. An excellent, honest memoir.	2000-04-14

I especially liked the full-color photos on every page, well-done and with plenty of close-ups. The book covers bags from 1900-2000, including  bags of Judith Leiber, Prada, The Kelly Bag,Hermes, Guineess,Whiting &amp;  Davis, Schiaparelli, Chanel and many more designers. Great for both  beginning purse collectors and seasoned afficianados of great purse and bag  design.	2000-04-14

I  finished book one in one evening and, minutes after I turned the last page,  I ordered the next two books in the series. Can't wait to see how this  relationship turns out!	1998-10-17
