I have a longstanding interest in what might be called \\"domestic social history\\" of the 19th century -- how American and British households operated, what they ate and how, what were considered good manners, clothing customs, the functioning of the \\"servant class,\\" and all of that. The author of this excellent work is Curator of Household Accessories and Tablewares at the Strong Museum in Rochester, one of the leading Victoriana museums in this country, and she certainly knows her subject. Per the title, she concentrates on the kitchen and dining room (with short excursions into the garden for tea and into city restaurants for special occasions), explaining where customs like placemats originated, detailing the astonishing amount of china and silverware thought necessary in a proper middle-class home, and analyzing the evolution of table manners over a period of three generations. Period illustrations are plentiful, as are quotations from 19th century sources (the bibliography runs to six pages) and menus from the social pages of the newspapers. There's also a lengthy collection of recipes of the time. If you want to pick up on what William Dean Howells was really talking about, read this book.	2005-10-12

It's always a delight to find an author who creates characters in three dimensions instead of the more usual two; Morgan seems to stretch his people to five or six. This is the third novel in the series about Takeshi Kovacs, ex-Envoy, stone killer, freelance renegade, and very dangerous man to be on the wrong side of. It's been three centuries, objective time, and Kovacs is back on Harlan's World, where he originally came from. It's also been a couple of centuries since the Resettlement, the failed Quellist revolution that gave the Harlan family oligarchy a run for its money, and Kovacs -- who only wants to continue killing fundamentalist priests (it's personal) -- finds himself caught up, first, in the attempt to reclaim the nanoware-drenched continent the revolution produced, and, later, in a new revolutionary plot. Because it's part of Quell's teachings, that when things go against you, you retreat and you wait -- for generations, if necessary. But now, just maybe, Quellquist Falconer might be back, in the flesh. But that's just this novel's top-level plot. There's also Kovacs's vendetta against those who let die the only woman who mattered to him -- Real Death, no resleeving. And there's his longstanding relationships with the several criminal cultures of Harlan's World, and with his old Envoy trainer. Not to even mention being hunted by a younger, smart-assed version of himself. And, just out of sight, there are the vanished Martians, about whom we learned a lot in Morgan's second book, Broken Angels. There's military and political philosophy here, all of it cynical, there's imaginative anthropology, there's a certain amount of gruff sex, there are some great quotes, there's considerable death (some deserved, some not), and there are breath-grabbing battle scenes like you haven't read in years. Morgan's second Kovacs novel was twice as good as his first. This one is three times as good as his second. If this one doesn't win both the Hugo and the Nebula, there's no justice. But, hey -- Kovacs already knows that.<br /><br />PS -- I was astonished a previous reviewer compared this to Bester's _The Stars My Destination_. A great book, don't get me wrong (I even own a First Edition copy of it), but Gully Foyle is pretty and pale and poetic beside the dark and blistering Takeshi Kovacs!no justice.

Neither was a sovereign ruler but both had personalities of strength and authority. Emma (Ælfgifu after her marriage), sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy (though she carried a Frankish birth-name), was the queen first of Æthelred \\"the Redeless,\\" Saxon King of England, and then of Canute, the Danish conqueror of the island. Edith, daughter of Godwine, Earl of Wessex, furthered her family's dynastic ambitions by becoming the queen of King Edward the Confessor, and thereby Emma's daughter-in-law. But this volume is considerably more than a dual biography, and more even than the \\"gender study\\" it intends to be. It delves deeply into the dynastic power structures of  11th century ruling families and the nature of royal patronage which helped keep rulers in power. The prosopographical appendix and the extensive bibliography also are excellent.	2005-10-11

Though not an academic, she has developed a reputation for impartial, well considered, very well written prose. Here she oversees the contributions of a number of well-regarded historians, including John Gillingham, Neville Williams, Maurice Ashley, and John Clarke, each covering the dynasty in which they are expert. While this volume is primarily a collective royal biography, and therefore largely outside the scope of this bibliography, Fraser (presumably) has seen to it that the separate chapters emphasize the continuity of the Crown, even during periods of violent dynastic change. J. P. Brooke-Little, the Richmond Herald, also contributes occasional pages regarding the development of heraldry as displayed by England's monarchs.	2005-10-11

The Angevins, beginning with Henry II, had an almost equally great impact and their control continued more or less strongly for several centuries. In the earlier period, a century before the Conquest, the counts of Anjou were every bit the equals of the dukes of Normandy, eventually establishing an empire that stretched from  Scotland to the Pyrenees, and which encompassed both England and Aquitaine in addition to Anjou itself. The story really begins with Fulk Nerra, who built the Angevin state, both physically and politically, and laid the essential groundwork for Henry's later conquests. Of course, Fulk's efforts were based on those of his own predecessors, back into the early 9th century, and Bachrach spends a fair amount of time discussing this ancestral power and its roots in the old Roman civitates. Bachrach is perhaps the leading present authority on the Angevins and his theories are worth paying attention to. There's also an excellent, lengthy bibliography.	2005-10-11

The eleven contributors, all well-known specialists, include Marjorie Chibnall on \\"Feudalism and Lordship\\" and Lesley Abrams on \\"England, Normandy and Scandinavia,\\" both of which are excellent. Elisabeth van Houts's survey of historical writing is also very useful.	2005-10-11

Besides the architectural discussions (interesting but not germane to this bibliography), there's a great deal on how public buildings established the image of monarchy, whether autocratic or democratic, in the public mind. Fontainebleau, Versailles, Windsor Castle, Charlottenburg, Hampton Court, the Russian Winter Palace, Sch&ouml;nbrunn, Neuschwanstein, and the \\"pink palace\\" in Monte Carlo all have very different messages to impart. The author, who spent a decade on the editorial staff of Burke's, also is very knowledgeable about the dynastic trials and tribulations, successes and bragging rights that produced these showplaces, as well as the failures that led to many of them being converted to state-owned museums.	2005-10-11

By her second husband, Sir William Cavendish, she had five children, including William (who was created earl of Cavendish), Charles (whose son was created duke of Newcastle), Elizabeth (mother, by Charles Stuart, of Arabella Stuart, claimant to the throne who died in the Tower), and Mary (whose husband, a Talbot, inherited the earldom of Shrewsbury from Bess's fourth husband). This book follows the story of the younger William's descendants and Pearson does a good job of getting behind the state portraits and stately homes (including Chatsworth in Derbyshire) to the almost excessively human member of the family. The earls and dukes of Devonshire tended to marry well, including links to the Russells, Howards, Spencers, Butlers, Cecils, Fitzmaurices, Greys, and even the sister of President John F. Kennedy. The family also produced Charles Cavendish, a leading mathematician and close friend of Descartes, and, a century and a half later, Henry Cavendish, discoverer of hydrogen. Pearson does a very creditable job of recounting the history of a fascinating family.	2005-10-11

To that end, she provides a useful overview here, in thirty brief, unfootnoted chapters, of the spouses of all the monarchs from William I through William IV. Elizabeth is excluded, obviously, but Mary Tudor is included, as the wife of Philip II of Spain, as are Queen Anne and Queen Mary (of William-and-Mary). There's plenty of gossip and quotations from private correspondence, but the narrative is comfortably non-lurid. A good quick reference for the student of royal genealogy and an enjoyable read.	2005-10-11

The storyline, unfortunately, isn't really anything out of the ordinary. John Blacksad is a black cat private eye (emphasis on \\"black\\") hired by a school teacher from the wrong side of town to locate a missing student. This gets him caught up in local race politics and in family secrets, centering on Chief of Police Karup, a very large, very dangerous, very white polar bear with an embarrassing past, and he likes things run his way. Much good it does him, though. Think small-town Alabama in the 1950s. Now I'll have to try to find Book 1 of Blacksad's saga.	2005-10-10

In 2004, Richardson, a highly regarded specialist in royal and peerage genealogy with numerous published articles to his credit, brought out the first volume in a planned series -- _Plantagenet Ancestry,_ which tracked the descents of some 190 immigrants to the North American colonies from the Plantagenet monarchs of England, and which weighed in at 945 pages. This second installment is 150 pages thicker, and there are at least two more volumes in development, on descents from early feudal barons, and from the Emperor Charlemagne.<br /><br />Any high school graduate knows the term \\"Magna Carta\\" (the \\"Great Charter\\") but most have probably only a hazy understanding of its key role as the foundation of the English legislative system (and therefore of our own), and that it established the principle that even the king, the highest authority in the land, was subject to the law. The baronial party that forced King John to sign the document in 1215 didn't trust him to live up to the limitations and conditions it laid down, and so they elected from among their own number twenty-five barons to monitor and enforce compliance. Of these twenty-five Sureties, seventeen had descendants past four generations; of those, there were two father-son pairs (Richard and Gilbert de Clare, earls of Hertford, and Roger and Hugh Bigod, earls of Norfolk), leaving fifteen distinct families that were ancestral to 238 17th century North American colonists. As with the first volume, the author's careful organization of a large mass of complex data makes this a comparatively easy book to use, either for ready-reference or for extended reading. All descendant families are organized alphabetically, numbered generationally from the Magna Carta Surety, with emphasis on patrilineal descents. This is not a listing of all descendants in each generation; grandchildren without descendants themselves, for instance, are excluded. Citation of sources -- mostly the original sources -- is very extensive and the bibliography runs to nearly 100 large-size pages.<br /><br />With such a wide-ranging project, with so many sources being perused, one might hope for new discoveries, and there are many included in the book. Some, of course are minor corrections, but at least a dozen are noteworthy, especially as they affect the Bohun, de Verdun, Grey, Hastings, Pole, FitzMaurice, and Mowbray families.<br /><br />As with _Plantagenet Ancestry,_ after borrowing it for review, I bought a copy of this one for myself and I shall be waiting eagerly for subsequent volumes in the series.bibliography runs to nearly 100 large-size pages.<br /><br />With such a wide-ranging project, with so many sources being perused, one might hope for new discoveries, and there are many included in the book.

But its heyday was the twenty years either side of 1900 -- the high Victorian and Edwardian eras and on through the Great War -- in which every post office and village shop in the country, it seemed, carried his images of local sights for sale to tourists. Frith's photos are still very popular among collectors and local historians, for he and his assistants set out to record every single view of interest in the whole of England. The huge collection of images the company left behind were well on the way to uncaring destruction when a group of collectors were able to get hold of the surviving items -- \\"merely\\" 60,000 original glass plates and a quarter-million prints, now the basis of an unparalleled visual museum of the lives, work, and social mores of the English people over several generations. Ziegler has contributed the text for this collection of some 650 historical photos, which are accompanied by several hundred recent photos of the same views by John Cleare. For the student of modern social history, the result is fascinating, especially when a series of photos of, say, a seaside resort captures visitors from the 1890s, 1920s, 1950s, and late 1990s; in some cases, the clothing styles are the only significant change. Ziegler is generally quite able at providing context and historical discussion -- where the hedgerows went, the difference in status between the topper and the bowler. My only real complaint in that regard is that the captions of the photos much too frequently simply repeat a sentence or two from the text on the same page; under proper editorial guidance, this would have been an opportunity to slip in an additional remark or observation without adding to the book's length.	2005-10-09

Even though I'm not a typographer or type-designer, when I began engaging in desktop publishing a decade ago and sought out guidance for the decisions I suddenly had to make, I became interested in the history and minutiae of fonts and letterforms for their own sake. Also, in pursuit of a master's degree in library science more than thirty years ago, I took an elective in the \\"History of Books and Printing,\\" so the background knowledge was already there. Loxley has produced a thoroughly fascinating social and philosophical history of the development of type, beginning with Gutenberg (who may or may not have been the inventor of moveable type) and following the development of words-in-print down through the centuries to the Nazi affection for Blackletter and the present-day democratization of the field via the personal computer. The author is very knowledgeable, especially about biographical details and personalities among western type designers. Illustrations and quotations are frequent and the book itself, naturally, is very nicely designed with footnotes and cut-lines set off in a one-third-size outside column. Though this is Loxley's first book, I hope it won't be his last.	2005-10-08

These aren't granted in recognition of military courage or (usually) accomplishment in civilian life, but simply because the recipient was born to the upper classes. The Order of the Garter is about as about as far from democracy as you can get. On the other hand, because the Garter has been around since Edward III established the club in 1348, it has become the most respected and most cherished award that may be made, not only to British citizens but to foreign rulers -- even the emperor of Japan. Vickers has been hanging around the subject since attending his first Garter ceremony at the age of thirteen (as you tells you several times), and has become perhaps the leading nonprofessional authority on orders of knighthood. Edward VII fought several times with his government over the granting of the Garter, though he distributed lesser decorations almost like lunch tips. Some peers have had no interest in or time to spend worrying about such things, while others (notably Earl Mountbatten) \\"collected orders the way other people collect stamps.\\" As Vickers notes, the present monarch has been notably stingy with honours to her own relatives, which probably is not a bad thing.	2005-10-08

The Better Homes & Gardens cookbooks are generally pretty good, at least to the extent that I almost always find a number of recipes to try, and several that go into my recipe file. This book is divided into the obvious sections -- soups & stews, meat dishes, poultry, and sides -- plus sections on sweets (they're trying to hard with some of them, just to be able to include them in a slow-cooker book) and party snacks & beverages. I enjoyed the \\"Corn and Sausage Chowder\\" (except that it calls for turkey sausage -- yech! -- and I used smoked beef sausage) with French bread, and the \\"South of the Border Steak Beans\\" was good (flank steak, bell peppers, pinto beans, and feta cheese, with lots of spices and served over rice). Things like buffalo wings and mini-meatballs do really well in a slow-cooker and you can keep them hot at a party. I've also made hot cider for Christmas get-togethers in a crockpot, and there's an interesting variation of that here, too. I don't know if I would actually buy this book, but it's certainly worth checking out from the library.	2005-10-06

But this one is pretty much a disappointment. The subtitle is \\"Simple Recipes and Fun Ideas to Turn Mealtime into Quality Time,\\" and the idea seems to be to increase \\"together time\\" by decreasing time at the stove, and by involving the kids in the food prep. Well, all my kids are grown and long gone, and I don't need to color lunch bags, personalize the pizza, jumping in the leaf piles, or telling stories about objects in the kitchen. There are themes, too: \\"Asian Night\\" includes egg rolls (buy them frozen at the store -- whoopee) and \\"Cantonese Chicken Chop Suey\\" (just chicken breasts, rice, and frozen stir-fry veggies).

Amis on language use can be infuriating. In reading through his usage notes, I found myself swinging from a fist-pumping \\"YES!\\" to gleeful snickers to an appalled \\"Say what?!\\" The author was the product of a classical education in the 1930s, which he explains as the basis of some of his preferences, but he's also partial to the way Americanisms have crept into British English -- usually. He doesn't like \\"aren't I\\" (it should be \\"am I not,\\" since \\"amn't I\\" is hardly pronounceable), and he compares calling children \\"kids\\" to calling an Italian a \\"wop.\\" He thinks foreign words when used by an Englishman should be forced into an Anglicized pronunciation; anyone who tries to pronounce a French word or term as the French do is a \\"wanker.\\" To me, this is the worst sort of imperial arrogance -- and it's even more puzzling since Amis also inveighs against the British tendency to snootiness overseas. On the other hand, he counsels the reader to avoid dressed-up, generally wrongly-used vogue words like \\"opine,\\" \\"orchestrate,\\" \\"feedback,\\" and \\"relevant,\\" with which I entirely agree. But just when he's on a roll, he declares that \\"`Restauranteur' is impossible in French and a pretentious illiteracy in English.\\" Sigh. Well, read the book and enjoy Amis's ability to draw blood with a well-chosen word, but don't feel obliged to agree with all his judgments or to accept his occasional pomposity.	2005-10-06

Willis is one of my favorite writers, the author of such masterful novels as _Doomsday Book_ and _To Say Nothing of the Dog._ She also does some terrific shorter work. This one is novella-length, just under 100 pages, but I have to say it's not really one of her best efforts. Rob is the editor and principal writer of a magazine called THE JAUNDICED EYE, in the mold of THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, dedicated to blowing the whistle on spiritualists, creationists, psychics, and other flim-flam artists, especially those practicing in his home base of Los Angeles. He doesn't much bother with \\"channelers,\\" since there's no way to compile objective evidence disproving them, but he makes an exception when his assistant -- a gorgeous, semi-wealthy ex-movie star named Kildy with a crush on him -- comes across a third-rater calling herself Ariraura, who seems to be channeling the spirit of H. L. Mencken, the great debunker and rationalist himself. An interesting conundrum: How do you help a channeled spirit disprove the fraudulent medium through whom he makes himself known? The writing is light, the insights on Mencken's professional life are interesting (though the author ignores his other, sometimes distasteful opinions), and the narrative moves right along, but it nevertheless seems a bit flat. And I have one question: Since Mencken speaks with his own gravelly voice in all his earlier appearances, why does he speak with the channeler's voice in the big climatic scene?	2005-09-24

I went straight from the first novel in this apparent series, the thoroughly amazing _Bangkok 8,_ to this one, so all the richness of Burdett's portrayal of the city and its lower social layers was still fresh in my mind. The second book is equally good, though a bit different. Having established the milieu, the author is now free to pursue the complex plot without too many explanatory digressions. Detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep of the Royal Thai Police finds himself (against his better Buddhist judgment) handling the day-to-day operations of a successful new brothel established by his mother, a retired prostitute and nascent feminist (and a marvelous character). He's also besotted with Chanya, a very astute practitioner of sex-for-hire in his mother's operation, who (in the Thai way) is also somewhat innocent at heart. And Chanya was involved with Mitch Turner, a CIA operative in the southern, Islamic part of Thailand, who was also smitten with her. And Turner is now dead, in a particularly gruesome way, and apparently at Chanya's hand. Of course, simple investigation of the murder is not an option, given the CIA's habit of blowing things out of proportion, plus the Agency's conviction these days that every bad event in the world must be traced back to Al Qaida -- which could cause a religious civil war in Thailand. Besides, Sonchai's boss, the brilliantly corrupt Police Colonel Vikorn, is the majority stockholder in the brothel and he doesn't want to lose Chanya's services. But there's more! In fact, there are layers upon layers here, and (like the first book) you should read slowly to understand and savor each plot twist and social nuance. And I haven't even gotten to the business about the tattoos yet.

American and European scholarship regarding Buddhist thought and its application in eastern social systems has changed considerably in the past few decades, however, and this recent volume is a very good introductory overview. Each section is written and edited by a different scholarly authority, beginning with Buddhism's historical and political origins, progressing to its principals and practices and a discussion of its evolved holy writings, and concluding with a section on \\"Buddhism Today\\" that points up its diversity from Indian to China to Japan to southeast Asia. The narrative is smooth and frequent sidebars offer more detailed explanations of doctrinal or historical points as needed. The illustrations are numerous and mostly in color. My only gripe, really, is an editorial one: On nearly every page, it seems, there is at least one in-text cross-reference (\\"see pp. 20-21\\") which encourage the reader to jump around, which leads one to lose track of what are often very alien ideas.	2005-09-24

This somewhat slender volume is a collective biographical portrait (not quite a study) of more than two dozen important figures surrounding the king, from the Catholic chaplains of his early reign to the calculating older men in his later years who made their fortunes from the acquisition of monastic lands. He also draws sharp distinctions between the pietistic old Yorkist families and the much more subtle \\"modern\\" families of the next generation. Though there is an inevitable emphasis on religious figures, especially Bishop Fisher, the author's breadth of knowledge and humanitarian style make this a useful and highly readable volume.	2005-09-17

Philip \\"the Bold\\" was shrewd and a patron of the arts, John \\"the Fearless\\" was almost too ambitious for his own good, Philip \\"the Good\\" almost took the throne of France, and Charles \\"the Rash\\" went toe-to-toe with Louis XI, the first modern ruler in terms of cold-blooded nationalism. Calmette was a leading authority on this period and he spends some time specifically on the evolution of Burgundy from a weak kingdom to a more powerful duchy and on the problems of dynastic succession. This is arguably the best general study of ducal Burgundy available in English. Be aware, though, that several egregious errors were made in drawing the genealogical charts.	2005-09-17

But some of these women were strong-willed and talented in their own right and came to exert considerable influence over their adopted nations. The author, an Austrian-Bohemian whose family lost everything in the two world wars, lived in Australia and Africa, studied art in Italy, and established her own design company in London. In 1978, she married Prince Michael of Kent, Queen Elizabeth's first cousin, and set up housekeeping in Kensington Palace (and still ran her company). In this volume, she outlines the lives of eight women married off as political chess pieces, and especially their experiences in their new homelands. These include major figures like Marie Antoinette of Austria, who married Louis XVI of France and went to the guillotine, and Catherine of Anhalt, who became empress of Russia; lesser lights like Leopoldina of Austria, who became empress of Brazil, and Maria Carolina, also of Austria, who married the king of Naples; much-loved figureheads like the Danish princess who became Queen Alexandra of Great Britain; and the tragic figures of Empress Victoria of Prussia, daughter of Queen Victoria of Great Britain, whose husband, Frederick III, died only three months after acceding to the throne of Germany, and Empress Marie of Russia, who lived to see her son, Nicholas II, executed with his family. Because of her inside track with both Austrian and British titled families, the author generally does a good job of conveying the attitudes of her subjects. But because this is in no way a scholarly book, her many quotes lack citations and the short bibliography is heavy on popular works. Still, it's a good place to start.	2005-09-17

While this social biography of Henry recycles much of the research from her earlier books, it's a very readable overview of the machinations of the king among the noble families who surrounded him, and of the jockeying of the Boleyns, Seymours, Courtenays, Parrs, Howards, Brandons, Douglases, Poles, and Cromwells among themselves. One's position - literally and physically - within the court indicated one's importance and, as the author shows, Henry deftly orchestrated the relative ranks of his courtiers. Most of all, Weir details the organizational and bureaucratic context within which the king moved.	2005-09-17

Was she the victim of a Cromwellian conspiracy? Or, as Warnicke suggests, more the victim of circumstances in her inability to produce a male heir? It's certain that Henry was profoundly insecure about his family's hold on the throne, and that Anne, daughter of the earl of Ormond, was closely related to the Howard dukes of Norfolk. The earl, in fact, created a network of family connections in pursuit of his own dynastic ambitions that helped to doom his daughter. A first-rate study of family politics, and you don't have to accept her own conspiratorial theories.	2005-09-17

Certainly, Harold Godwinson is remembered mostly for having lost his kingdom at Hastings, but the family went on to be both glorified and demonized. Where did all this status come from? The hard facts regarding the family's wealth and power survive to some extent in official records but the narrative context is all prejudicial in one direction or the other. Mason tries to correct this by tracing the role of the kin-group in Anglo-Saxon society, and the importance of the church (which Godwine and his descendants carefully supported), and the astute political maneuvering by the founder of the family during the reign of Canute, the canny Danish interloper. An expert study and a good starting point for further examination of the kingdom-as-family-business.	2005-09-17

By examining the way in which the king selected \\"new men,\\" created new titles, promoted existing peers, and saw to it that the extinction of a title was always to his own advantage, Miller shows how Henry's attitudes, policies, and use of patronage reflected his dynastic insecurities.	2005-09-17

The consensus has been that this meant the Kingdom of Jerusalem and its various tenant counties by conquest experienced a \\"pure\\" feudalism, with an especially powerful nobility -- but Tibble argues that this is not the case, that the balance of power was much more evenly divided between the monarchy and the aristocracy. In making his case, he examines in some detail the family connections and land holdings of the conquerors. A basic background knowledge of Outre-Mer is helpful.	2005-09-17

Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, uncle and principal advisor of the soon-to-be Queen Victoria, accepted the job from the Belgian National Congress after turning down a similar offer from the Greeks; he married (his third) the daughter of Louis-Philippe of France. Their son, Leopold II, is remembered mostly for the colonial genocide carried out on his orders in the Congo, of which he was personally the sole owner, and for his reliance on a particularly brutal form of slavery. His nephew, who succeeded him as Albert I, led the army heroically (though futilely) in World War I, but when the country's right wing encouraged him to rule by decree, he refused, preferring constitutionalism to autocracy. His son, Leopold III, surrendered much to quickly to the armies of the Reich in 1940, spent the war under house arrest, went into exile in 1946 while his loyalty was examined, and was forced to abdicate in 1951 in favor of his son, Baudoin, a hyper-religious man who proved a sometimes difficult sovereign. (And that's as far as the book goes, though the childless Baudoin was followed in 1993 by his younger brother as Albert II.) The Coburg women also were an unlucky lot, producing Empress Carlotta of Mexico (who died in 1927 after a half-century of intermittent insanity), and Stephanie, the wife of Archduke Rudolf of Austria, who killed himself in a suicide pact with his mistress in 1889. (She also had to fight her own father, Leopold II, in court over her inheritance.) If this story is a dynastic soap opera, Aronson tells it urbanely and entertainingly, with due attention to both fact and gossip.	2005-09-17

There's a famous painting by Tuxen (reproduced on the jacket of this fat volume) of Victoria's family gathered around her at the time of her Golden Jubilee in 1887; the crowd fills the royal drawing room. During those celebrations, the women of the family filled ten carriages while the men, including a number of ruling and future monarchs, made up an impromptu cavalry troop. Aronson is an old and skilled hand at producing popular biographies of European dynasties and he uses Victoria's position as matriarch of a vast royal clan to construct an overview in the late 19th and early 20th century of Europe's ruling families on ten thrones, from London and Madrid to Athens and St. Petersburg. This is also a personal and domestic study, focusing on court life, rather than a political history, and it is limited to only the first generation, not their heirs to the present day -- which also means that, except for the future Edward VIII, the author is concerned mostly with Victoria's daughters and granddaughters who married into other royal houses. The author's style is easy and his insights and judgments are astute, making this a good introduction to the modern monarchies of Europe.	2005-09-17

All but one (a study of Roger Mortimer by David Carpenter) originally were presented as papers at an international conference at King's College, London, in 1998. The authors are all well-known and the subjects range geographically from England and France to Poland, Norway, and Portugal. I found two papers of special interest: \\"The Origins of the Nobility in Francia\\" by Paul Fouracre and Janet Nelson's \\"Nobility in the Ninth Century\\"; the chapters concerned with linguistics and literature were less useful. Martin Aurell ends the volume with \\"The Western Nobility in the Late Middle Ages: A Survey of the Historiography and Some Prospects for New Research,\\" an excellent pointer to neglected subjects in which work needs badly to be done. Some volumes of this type include a catch-all bibliography covering all the included topics; this one, unfortunately, does not, but that's a minor criticism.	2005-09-17

That word \\"exotic\\" has a rather condescending flavor in the mouth of a Westerner, though it was bound to be used (and was) in reviews of this astonishing, at times almost scholarly work. To begin with, even though it's only about 320 pages, this is a very dense novel -- not in the sense of being difficult to read, because the author's narrative style is certainly highly readable, but because to get the full effect you really ought to read it slowly, rereading the sections you don't quite understand the first time through, and pausing at intervals to think about the sheer alieness of it all. Sonchai Jitpleecheep is half farang -- Anglo -- and it's this split heritage that gives him the ability to serve as our guide to the real Krung Thep (known to outsiders as Bangkok), and which also enables us to puzzle over the strange (and, yes, exotic) ways of the West from his point of view. There are really three stories here. There's the murder of a large, handsome, black U.S. Marine in a particularly dramatic fashion, which also results in the death of Sonchai's partner and best more-than-friend; for this, as a matter of honor, Sonchai will kill those responsible. (To which a Thai would nod and say \\"Of course.\\") The investigation is knottily complex, especially because every Thai policeman is a \\"profit point\\"; it isn't even corruption to them. The second story is the mutually puzzling relationship between Sonchai and Kimberly, a gorgeous FBI special agent also working the case, but with her own additional agenda. Karma and past lives have a large part in this. The third story, though, is an exploration of how Bangkok works (and it does work, in its own Buddhist way), why the city has fascinated Americans since the Vietnam War, and how the West has affected it, for good and ill. To Americans, Thailand seems to be all about sex, in every possible form, and especially about prostitution. (To which accusation a Thai would shrug and say \\"And your point is. . . ?\\") Because context is everything. Sonchai's mother is a successful, now retired prostitute, a respected member of the business community. Thai prostitutes -- all of whom seem supernaturally beautiful to Western eyes -- treat humanely clients American hookers would make faces at: The homely, the disfigured, the merely aged. The point is made, over and over, that America is a consumer society and we end up consuming each other. It's also very Thai that there's no neat ending.

And you won't find her wishy-washing when it comes to inviting same-sex couples to dinner or organizing a shower for an unwed mother; to her, people are people and all are deserving of polite treatment, if not always respect.

Rei Shimura is the California-born daughter of a well-off Japanese father and an Anglo mother, but for two years she's been living in a seedy apartment in a poor part of Tokyo in an effort to make it on her own. Her field, courtesy of an M.A. from Berkeley, is antique Japanese art and craft, but because of the lack of museum jobs she's been making ends meet teaching English to the employees of an export-heavy appliance company. A rare winter vacation to a country inn involves her in the murder of the wife of an executive who turns out to have a very checkered past and character, and she also finds herself thrown together with a Scots lawyer who works for the same firm and who knew the woman -- but he has some secrets, too. The plot becomes very complicated very quickly, but the author does a good job of moving things along and not telegraphing the key points. The plot and the characters are well done, especially those of Rei and her gay roommate, but the prose sometimes swings between stilted and gushy. A better developmental editor would have found numerous suggestions to make regarding word choice. But, over all, I enjoyed it and I'll be looking for the next in the series, as there seem to be six out now.	2005-09-10

Emperor William I of Germany was a reactionary autocrat willing to place himself under the thumb of Otto von Bismarck, though his empress, Augusta, loathed the chancellor. Their son, Frederick III, comparatively liberal in his ideas and ignored for most of his life, ascended the throne in 1888 and died three months later -- unfortunately for Germany. His wife, Victoria, the daughter of Queen Victoria of Great Britain, was shrewd and idealistic and Bismarck hounded her to her death. And their son, William II, was a flamboyant, power-mad megalomaniac who presided over the destruction of the dynasty. Aronson is less interested in the history of Germany, however, than in the interplay of personalities and hatreds within the family and between them and Bismarck, concentrating on such unofficial sources as court gossip of the era. If ever there was a ruling dynasty that deserved to fail, probably it was this one.	2005-08-29

While the Romanovs had ruled imperial Russia since 1613, the male line died out in the mid-18th century. The succeeding Holstein-Gottorp dynasty (a branch of the Oldenburgs), in the person of Peter III, took the Romanov name and produced five more tsars before the Russian monarchy came to an end in 1918. Tsar Paul was idealistic and generous but also vindictive and paranoid, and ultimately was assassinated. Alexander I, a complex and contradictory figure with mystical leanings, was also the most powerful ruler on the Continent after the fall of Napoleon. Nicholas I was a repressive autocrat of limited intellectual ability and was succeeded by Alexander II, a despotic but soft-hearted reactionary, nevertheless emancipated Russia's serfs. He, too, was assassinated, which led his son, Alexander III, to tighten his control of the Russian state. And his son, Nicholas II, was totally incapable of meeting the demands of the job in an age of world war mixed with long-simmering revolution. Moreover, all the tsars in this period married German princesses, which did nothing to endear the ruling family to the Russian people during the Great War. The author does a good job of tracing the psychological threads and social and political environments that formed this disastrous family.	2005-08-29

They included George IV, William IV, and a collection of royal dukes (some of whom had large families of illegitimate children) and princesses (most of whom married late or never). Until the middle of the 20th century, the family had a poor collective reputation, largely the product of propaganda by Whig politicians and historians. The publication of previously unseen correspondence and diaries has led to a degree of rehabilitation, but the Hanoverians probably will never rate highly with later generations. This isn't just a collection of brief biographies but an informative study of the interrelationships among the siblings, their extra-familial connections within and outside the court. Van der Kiste has produced a number of mini-dynastic studies of this sort, of which this volume is perhaps the most useful because of the earlier period it covers.	2005-08-29

He and all his English relatives would now represent the House of Windsor. Though not as charismatic as his playboy father, he was much loved and respected at his death. His eldest son, Edward VIII, was another matter and his abdication was undoubtedly a good thing for the country in the long run. Edward's brother, George VI, shared their father's shyness but became a symbol of national unity in the next world war. George's daughter, Elizabeth II, continues to muddle along. The author relates the facts but puts them in the context of the vast changes Britain and the world experienced in the 20th century: The disappearance of the empire, the tabloidization of royal family crises, and the magnified effects of personal eccentricities and foibles on British society. (On the other hand, she seems to pass over completely the greatly enhanced role of the United States in world affairs.)<br /><br />The late Countess of Longford was both a committed socialist and a Roman Catholic convert, and produced several writers among her eight children, including Lady Antonia Fraser. They certainly came by their talents honestly, since their mother's work displays both a gift for biography and an easy, communicative style that combines serious history with popular narrative. She also had obvious inside help in compiling much of the detail in this useful dynastic overview.	2005-08-29

Ever since the appearance of _Remains of the Day,_ Ishiguro has been recognized as one of the most original, observant, and thoughtful writers in Britain. And he's done it again with this quietly forceful story set in a alightly alternate present, of young people -- clones -- raised solely to supply needed organs to the rest of the British population, until they die. Though the details of the program are never stated, and only once does the word \\"die\\" cross a character's lips. Donors don't die, they \\"complete.\\" But Kathy and Tommy and Ruth and the rest of their privileged group are at least raised under the relatively benign influence of Hailsham, an isolated, insulated country facility where they acquire education and culture and produce art under the tutelage of the Guardians. They, and we, discover their true natures and their unavoidable purpose in life very gradually, so the reader must have patience as the world in which the students live takes shape, as they reach maturity and (at the age of fourteen) go on to an intermediary stage for a year or two at the Cottages (where they break their psychological ties to Hailsham and learn to do for themselves), and then enter training as \\"carers\\" -- because those who haven't yet become donors must look after those who have. Some are better at this than others, and Kathy, the narrator, outlasts all of her close friends and fellow students, reaching what is apparently her late twenties before moving on to the next stage -- becoming a donor herself. And all of them accept this fate as perfectly normal, though even the Guardians, who claim to be on their side, have a superior attitude toward their charges. It's what they're for, after all. The interpersonal dynamics among the three principal characters make up much of the story, as seen and explicated by Kathy. They don't always get along, and Kathy explains each time in almost obsessive detail how and why things go wrong, which is another instance of her need to understand things. Ruth, especially, is often a trial as a friend, with her bossiness and airs and need to be accepted by those more advanced in the process than her. But Tommy is a very sympathetic person, and so is Kathy, even though she can be pretty wishy-washy when she's young. Ishiguro is amazingly talented in the subtle rendering of his characters and they, and this book, will grow on you -- even as you become horrified at their impending futures.

Some of the papers consider particular castles, like Hedingham and Orford, or fortifications in particular areas, like Scotland or the Welsh marches. But castles didn't exist in a cultural or political vacuum, so there's also quite a lot here on the Bayeux Tapestry, Alan of Brittany and the honour of Richmond, the Anarchy and the building programs of Matilda and Stephen, and the effects of castle architecture on later, nonmilitary construction projects. Any medievalist will therefore find a great deal of interest, and there's also a useful bibliography (which is actually pretty long to be, as it warns, \\"selected\\").	2005-08-27

After several pages on surface land forms and geology, we go straight to Roman London, how and why the town was established where it was, and the location of the first bridge across the Thames. The six gates in the Roman wall are located and the commercial quarter is depicted in detail, as is the fort at Cripplegate. Then we move forward through Saxon and Norman London, the medieval, Tudor, and Stuart period, and so on, up to the aftermath of World War II. Subsequent maps and their accompanying text discuss industrialization and suburbanization, the construction of major new motorways connecting the city to the rest of the country, and plans for the future (as they were more than a decade ago). There are any number of fascinating birds-eye reconstruction of London at various early periods, before the first surviving representations of the town. There are also extensive pictorial discussions of building materials, parks and gardens, the underground, \\"agricultural London\\" (not a theme even most modern Londoners, probably, would consider), the effect of immigration, royal London, and more. Finally, there's a series of overviews of each section of London with detailed maps, drawings, and photos, and an etymological dictionary of London place-names. This is a marvelous book for browsing as well as a useful reference work.	2005-08-23

I first became aware of the Arts & Crafts movement of William Morris and his circle back in the late 1960s, when Art Nouveau (an outgrowth of Arts & Crafts) was enjoying a renaissance. I ended up with several pieces of Arts & Crafts-style furniture (replicas, naturally, on my graduate school budget), some poster (reprints) and a couple of affordable ceramics (original). And I made a point thereafter of searching out museum collections and galleries specializing in this stuff. I still have a preference for the clean lines of furniture and the luminescent glazes on pots, especially those by Pilkington and Rookwood. Miller has brought together in this beautifully produced volume more than a thousand examples of design and craft, with detailed descriptions and notes and a list of \\"Key Features\\" for various artists and studios. Approximate values also are included, though I'm happy just to look at the pictures. If you're trying to learn about the Arts & Crafts movement, this would be a good visual textbook.	2005-08-21

This is a slice-of-life style of thing -- not a lot of \\"action\\" in the dramatic sense, no real beginning or end (just a pregnant pause). Much of the book is about how they met five or six years earlier, how they learned about each other (Wow! She reads comics!) and met each other's parents, and so on. It's also about the gay art instructor (and how Paul deals with that fact) who turned their worlds upside down by taking them away from the precise rendition of vacuum cleaners in pencil and teaching them instead the principles of design, and who also takes them on a field trip to New York -- which Paul thinks of as \\"the big city,\\" as if Montreal were just a village! And it's about Aunt Janette and her travels, and about Lucie's two small nieces, whom she and Paul babysit one weekend. And that's pretty much the plot. These are all very likable people, and it's an absolutely delightful experience. The artwork is rectangular panels, four to nine to the page, all in straight black-and-white line drawings, but the rendition of the surroundings is representational; I have no doubt a Montreal native would know exactly where each scene was set. The people are simply drawn, too, but the expressions and postures are just evocative enough to pull you completely into Paul's and Lucie's world. In fact, the photo at the very end may catch you off-guard -- as I admit it did me. Very nice stuff.	2005-08-21

In his more recent yarns, Pratchett has had trenchant (though always funny) things to say about such deep-rooted Western mythmaking institutions as war and religion. In this earlier work, he takes on a more fearsome set of myths: Hollywood! The Holy Wood, down the coast from Ankh-Morpork, in an area where the sun is always bright, is the site of \\"leakage\\" by Things from the other side of reality (or somewhere) that are trying to take over the Discworld by perverting the minds of innocent people and animals. Victor, a student wizard at Unseen University who knows better than to graduate and lose his funding, gets sucked into the boom, as does Ginger, an erstwhile milkmaid who suddenly decides she wants to be the most famous person in the world. Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler becomes a producer, Laddie the not-very-bright Wonder Dog becomes a star, and Gaspode (who really does talk) becomes an agent. The plot, such as it is, concerns Victor's realization of just what's going on and his attempts to evict the Things from his own reality. But, of course, that's really just an excuse for Pratchett to dredge up every movie clich&eacute; he can think of, almost always hilariously. (In fact, some of his references are so sly and relatively obscure, I suspect they'll be wasted on younger readers with little experience of the old Hollywood system and of old films.) This isn't one of Pratchett's best, by a long shot, but it's still far above most novels.	2005-08-21

They end up going back downstairs for coffee and, gradually, almost inevitably, they bond. They know nothing about one another at the outset, and they come from widely varying backgrounds, but as a \\"gang\\" of almost-suicides, they understand at least one very important thing about each other that most other people would not. And as often as they fall out, and as much as they frequently dislike each other in various combinations, they keep getting back together of the next couple of months.<br /><br />Maureen is fifty-one, never married, not especially attractive, and a recently practicing Catholic, but that didn't keep her from trying to do herself in. Her biggest problem is Mattie, her nearly-grown, severely retarded son, who absorbs every moment of her life, awake and asleep, to the complete exclusion of the entire rest of the world. As a result, Maureen is dreadfully naive but not hopelessly so; she's just very inexperienced. She's so desperate for change, for escape from her circumstances, that death seems very attractive. And she also has a way to unexpectedly cutting to the chase emotionally that makes the rest of the gang pause and listen and take her seriously.<br /><br />Jess is an eighteen-year-old royal screw-up, the younger daughter of the junior minister of education whose older daughter vanished four years earlier. Jess seems to function properly only when she's angry and picking a fight and being drunk and/or drugged. She's educationally challenged but not stupid, though she has a problem with similes and metaphors when she speaks and with \\"those speech mark things\\" when she writes. Her problem, though she doesn't quite realize it, is extreme loneliness because her uncontrolled behavior completely alienates everyone, and I mean *everyone*. It's simply her nature, and at least she knows it.<br /><br />JJ is a thirty-year-old American, a recently failed musician who has also lost his girlfriend. Even he recognizes that his motivation for suicide is pretty thin, so at first he lies and tells the others he has a fatal brain disease. He's also a self-educated school-leaver with a tendency to literary pomposity. But where he assumed he would be okay after his band failed -- because he could just do something else with his life, right? -- he's begun to realize that that's not true. All he really wants to do is make music. He'd like to be a *famous* maker of music, naturally, but it's the music that really matters. Especially since the other members of his ex-band, about whose futures he was worrying, are doing just fine with session work. He's looking at maybe a half-century ahead of him as a non-musician and he can't take it. Being a soloist doesn't seem to have occurred to him.<br /><br />Martin is, in Jess's words, a \\"tosser.\\" He was co-presenter on a successful breakfast-time TV talk show (think Regis and Kathy Lee) but he got caught sleeping with a fifteen-year-old girl, lost his job, lost his wife and two daughters, and went to prison for a few months. But he's selfish, self-centered, and superior. He's entirely a victim of his own stupidity (which he admits), not of circumstances like the others, but maybe that's just his nature, too.<br /><br />The author lets each of the four relate their adventures in their own words on a round-robin basis, Roshomon-fashion, and the juxtaposition of viewpoints on the same events is frequently hilarious and very revealing of what makes each of them tick. Hornby is a dab hand at characterization and he shows here that he also has the speech patterns of class and age down pat.

The first half of the book, which is the first three issues in the original series, introduces the six cliched characters, including an upper-class git as the captain, a gay lieutenant, a pathological giant as the sergeant, a lower-class corporal, \\"Hank the Yank,\\" and (for some reason) a Scottish piper who is the captain's family retainer. Three of them never say anything beyond a single cliched phrase, and the piper never speaks at all. The Nazis are similarly borrowed from Warner Brothers. The second half of this collection is about the quest to capture the Fuhrer's mystical missing testicle, and it's somewhat better, if only because of the song everyone sings to annoy the Germans. But still. Bugs Bunny did it better.	2005-08-21

Anyone who has ever tried to write a screenplay, even one based on a novel much less on a real person's life or a real historical incident (and I have), knows you do indeed have to adapt a story (or real life) to the medium of film -- but there's a limit, and some flicks are just too much to take. The authors, talented entertainment-journalists, know this, for the most part. They obviously loved *Shakespeare in Love* and admit that it stuck close to the exceedingly few facts that are known about Shakespeare; likewise *Girl with a Pearl Earring* (a gorgeous film), since almost nothing is known about Vermeer. And they'll accept the rather minor biographical changes made in *Erin Brockovich* and *Norma Rae* as being simply unavoidable. But they really rake Mel Gibson over the coals (deservedly, I think), both for the perversion of English history committed in *Braveheart* (the Christ-like martyrdom of Wallace, they suggest, was practice for *The Passion*) and for the equally perverted treatment of the American Revolution in *The Patriot* (which pissed off a lot of people on the other side of the Atlantic with its suggestion of Nazi-style behavior on the part of the British). They come down hard on *The Hurricane* for claiming that Carter won fights that he actually lost, merely to reenforce the theme of racism, nor have they anything good to say about *Elizabeth*, the 1998 version, in which Cate Blanchett portrays a young queen so insipidly naive and trusting, \\"she wouldn't have lasted longer than a fortnight (or whichever ye olde calendar notation ye prefer)\\" -- in which they'll entirely correct. (I hated that movie.) They don't have much use for Spike Lee's egotism, either, especially in *Malcolm X*. They reserve real venom for the fact that *Amistad* not only jerks history around, the production company, Spielberg's Dreamworks, actually had the nerve to send out study guides to schools promoting wholly made-up characters as actual historical models to be emulated. In other cases, the authors simply wonder why liberties with real people were taken unnecessarily, as in *Seabiscuit* or *The Elephant Man*. Some of the biopics the pair analyze, such as *American Splendor*, probably don't belong here (Harvey Pekar is hardly \\"historical\\"), and some, like *Communion* and *The Mothman Prophecies*, don't belong anywhere, but they presumably had to come up with an even hundred. However, the film that led to this book being written is Oliver Stone's *JFK*, the most vilified film ever made -- before it was even released.

Scarlett, across the street, was named for you-know-who. Both are \\"onlies,\\" just turning sixteen, and have been best friends, almost-sisters since they were eleven. Then Michael, the boy to whom Scarlett lost her virginity only the night before, is killed in a car wreck and -- you guessed it -- she's pregnant. Her mother also had gotten pregnant in high school and (fortunately for Scarlett) had kept the baby, and now she decides to do the same. Meanwhile, Halley is getting more and more involved with Macon, Michael's dangerous buddy, who wants more than she's ultimately willing to give. The nine months of Scarlett's pregnancy is the backdrop for a very well-written story about love and sex and real friendship and dealing with parents. And the final scene, in the hospital waiting room, is very cinematic. This is a terrific book for teenagers, but it's also simply a very, very well done novel.	2005-08-10

He also has some cogent things to say on the present state of research and those doing it, and on the useful place of genealogy in pursuing it. The \\"prehistory\\" of the English peerage, he says, goes back to the Welsh princes, though the concept of \\"knight\\" is definitely Norman; the blending of the two streams of sociopolitical development led to a unique system in Britain. The later chapters on the insignia of rank -- banner, coronet, etc -- in defining the aristocrat, and the role of the castle (beyond its military purpose) and the manor in enforcing that status also are excellent. The twenty-page bibliography should be taken as a guide to further reading.	2005-08-06

Doakes has advanced from unformed suspicion regarding Dexter's nightstalker activities to full-press harassment. Of course, Doakes shares some of Dexter's killer tendencies himself, so who better to act as hunter? In self-defense, Dexter is trying to appear as ordinary as possible, spending inordinate amounts of time with his girlfriend and her kids (all of which is merely a clever disguise as he is constitutionally incapable of love). Actually, having discovered the relaxing effects of beer, he seems to be sliding into couch-potato-hood and the whole thing is \\"driving him normal.\\" But then another killer turns up, a previously government-sanctioned one, whom Doakes knows all about, and the semi-big guns arrive from Washington.<br /><br />Being, by his own description, a monster, Dexter is quite incapable of feeling emotion of any kind. He also has zero empathy,  which often makes it hard for him to understand what people are actually thinking or what the unspoken conversations of gesture and expression around him mean. But he has become very good at faking humanity. On the other hand, Dexter is also fond of children. And the discovery that one of Rita's kids might be a Dexter-in-waiting brings up all kinds of interesting possibilities.<br /><br />Lindsay's style, and the style he gives Dexter, is delightfully wry and dry, sometimes self-mocking, but never quite mordant. His descriptions are inventive and often memorable: After a sleepless night, for example, Dexter feels \\"as though someone had snuck in and packed my head with beach sand, even including the bottle caps and cigarette butts.\\"<br /><br />And up until the last two chapters, this story moves right along. Nearing the end, I wondered how Dexter was going to rescue the disliked and dangerous Sgt. Doakes -- because he had to, right? That would be a nice bit of irony, because Doakes would then be able to come back to haunt poor Dexter again in the next installment. Only the author makes a dreadful error here and the whole plotline falls apart. The ending isn't witty or amusing or ironic, much less believable, and Lindsay does his readers a great misservice.

Later rulers included such major figures as Alexander Nevsky (who defeated the Teutonic Knights) and Vasily II (who made the Orthodox Church independent), but the author begins his survey with Ivan III \\"the Great\\" in 1462. Each tsar or tsarina gets a boxed summary of personal data, an historical survey of the reign, a variety of illustrations and relevant maps, and often a basic genealogical drop-chart. Warnes is a well-known scholar of Russian history and culture and his interpretations of five centuries of Russian history are astute and well-written. Specialists in Western Europe often know very little about Russian history and the several dynasties that made it. This volume makes a good ready-reference resource.	2005-07-30

But this is very far from the case. As Clarke shows, all the earls under Edward came from just four families: Godwine and his wife and sons (including Harold, defeated at Hastings), Leofric of Mercia and his wife and sons and grandsons (the latter becoming earls of Mercia and Northumbria, Siward of Northumbria, and Ralph of Hereford, a nephew of King Edward). Actually, I hadn't been aware the wives of the earls owned such extensive holdings in their own names, which may say something about the difference between Anglo-Saxon proto-feudalism and the Norman variety. The extent of the Godwine estate was nearly twice that of the other three families added together, and in fact was only slightly smaller than the king's estates. Obviously, when Harold II went off to fight the invading Duke William, it was, in part, as the largest single landowner in England. The following close analysis of the sub-earl class of landholders is drawn almost entirely from Domesday Book, the single source without the survival of which we would have no picture of the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy at all. This volume being a reworking of Clarke's thesis at Oxford (which accounts for the slightly pompous style at times), about half the entire text consists of tables enumerating in great detail the lands assigned to the earls under King Edward and likewise the makeup of the \\"non-earlish\\" estates. A certain amount of lineage may be deduced from these. There is also a very good bibliography.	2005-07-30

This is not necessarily a bad thing, though many such books are written too breathlessly to be of much serious interest. Hindley is an unapologetic monarchist who believes a constitutional (as opposed to absolute) sovereign is the \\"most trouble-free method available of choosing a head of state.\\" He begins with those countries where monarchs are still politically involved, even though their countries are now republics (he's especially partial to royal informality in Sweden), and continues with an assessment of future prospects in constitutional monarchies. (Personal wealth helps; Prince Hans Adam of Liechtenstein probably could buy or sell his diminutive nation outright.) It's difficult to work up much enthusiasm for the various Balkan monarchs, all of whom were overthrown with prejudice, and France represents a singular case, with a history filled with republics interspersed with monarchs. Ranier of Monaco, though somewhat autocratic in his actions, did wonders in making secure the political and economic independence of his state, and the restoration of the Spanish royals was actually a step toward restored democracy. In fact, Hindley is a fan of King Juan Carlos, who took a very strong personal role (for a modern European monarch) in putting down the attempted military coup of 1980. The author's style is factual and highly readable and -- except for a number of regrettable lapses in copyediting and proofreading -- this volume will do very well until the next one is published.	2005-07-30

The content of Domesday, much of which relates to the great tenants of the king in 1086, plays to my interest in peerage genealogy, but I'm also an archivist by training, with a parallel interest in the books themselves -- what they look like, how they were written and bound, and so on. Dr. Hallam, Assistant Keeper at the Public Record Office for nearly thirty years, is probably the leading authority on Domesday in this generation and, as author or editor of a number of works of popular history, she has a demonstrated talent for describing and interpreting what she knows. The present volume was published as part of Domesday Book's 900th birthday celebration and concerns itself not with the details of its contents (available in several excellent and recent editions) but with the history of its use as a resource down through the centuries -- because Domesday still is a living document, not merely an historical artifact in a museum.

To them, increased educational and occupational opportunities were an economic and social threat to their power and right to rule. Comparing the aristocracies in Great Britain, France, Germany, and Russia, the author investigates their \\"strategies\\" (rather too active a term, but it's accepted jargon) and the ways they responded to the danger. What he finds, not surprisingly, is that each national group responded in its own way to the challenge from the lower classes in its own country. Even the most moss-bound, autocratic English lord could barely conceive of the literal power of life and death enjoyed by Russian noblemen over their serfs. By the First World War, the untitled middle classes, the self-made men -- especially in Britain and Germany -- had begun to rival the aristocracy in economic power and in some cases was actively infiltrating it through marriage and purchase of estates. On the other hand, the new class of millionaires included a few aristocratic magnates whose wealth was industrial, however ancient their titles. Lieven is a political economist with a strong background in Russian affairs and this is a thoroughly academic volume, complete with statistics and charts, but it's an important work on the decline of aristocratic power.	2005-07-30

In this second book in what looks to become a series, Mas has been called across the country to Brooklyn by his daughter, who has married an Anglo named Lloyd -- who, Mas discovers, is also a gardener and a student of the Japanese style. \\"Gasa-gasa\\" means \\"always on the move\\" and that certainly describes Mari Arai Jensen. When the benefactor of the foundation that owns the garden where Lloyd works is mudered, everyone involved is pointing fingers in different directions, except that several of them end up pointing at Mari. Mas, well aware of having never been the best of fathers, takes upon himself the job of solving the killing to protect his extended family. He's aided by Tug Yamada, Nisei war hero and all-around straight-arrow, who's also visiting in New York, and by his network of cronies back on the coast. Things get dicey more than once, but Mas is a stubborn o ld coot and he keeps at it. The author has a gift for empathetic characterization and dialogue, and for efficient description in a scene. Her prose is direct and unpretentious, and I look forward to more stories about these guys.	2005-07-30

One of the first instances of \\"genetic genealogy\\" was the investigation into the roots of the hemophilia that plagued the czarevich Alexei of Russia, the only son of Nicholas II, who probably wouldn't have lived long enough to become czar even if the Bolsheviks hadn't liquidated the imperial family. But Victoria's son, Leopold, also died of complications of the disease, and it made its way into the Spanish royal family, as well. Where did the defective gene Victoria carried come from? There are only two medical possibilities: Either she was the victim of a random mutation -- one chance in about 50,000 -- or her father was hemophiliac. And since her father, Edward, Duke of Kent, did *not* have the disease, that would mean Victoria was illegitimate, the offspring of a hemophiliac lover of the Duchess of Kent. The duchess certainly *did* have a lover, and it's also possible, from all the evidence, that the duke was sterile. In which case, the throne should rightfully have gone to King William III's next closest relative, . . . and who would that have been? This is quite a fascinating detective story, investigating in considerable depth the private lives of the Coburgs, and it leaves one to wonder how the 19th century in Britain might have been different if Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and subsequently king of Hanover (a very distasteful individual by all accounts, and a very unpopular ruler), had become king of Great Britain. (His eldest living descendant in the male line today is Ernest Augustus, Prince of Hanover and present husband of Princess Caroline of Monaco.)	2005-07-30

Taylor trained under G. M. Trevelyan, another noteworthy narrator of history, and became an illustrious Fellow of King's College, Cambridge. While he produced many important works in modern English history, he still is best known for his examination of the dynasty that began with the arrival in London 1714 of George, Duke of Brunswick, successor to Queen Anne, the last Stewart monarch. He didn't speak English and his son and successor, George II, barely could. The family has gotten bad press for generations, their reputation for loutishness and general lack of intellect perhaps being colored by American attitudes, but Plumb portrays them convincingly as ordinary human beings caught up in a series of exceptional circumstances: The rise of parliamentary power, the loss of the American colonies below Canada, the Industrial Revolution, the effects everywhere of the French Revolution, and the struggle against Napoleon. Like many others, I first read this book as an undergraduate, but I now much prefer the 1974 lavishly illustrated Hamlyn edition [which Amazon doesn't list]; the numerous political cartoons are especially useful in providing the flavor of the times.	2005-07-30

A knight must have a lady, but while many books have been written about medieval women, few have focused on the knight's female counterpart in society. Again, emphasis is on the aristocracy, since that's where the records are, though Coss depends heavily on surviving letters and contemporary literature as well as household accounts, and he even employs such sources as monumental effigies and brasses. Both books are stimulating studies with many examples drawn from noble families of the period.	2005-07-30

Buskin, however, is not an historian but a journalist who especially covered Princess Diana, as well as an author of pop biographies of subjects like Marilyn Monroe and John Lennon, so one might not expect much. His work, while generally accurate -- though he manages, through poor proofreading, to attribute the parentage of Elizabeth II to Edward VIII and Mrs. Warfield in the lineage chart at the back -- and reasonably well written, does tend to cuteness and witty asides. For the rank novice in matters royal, however, this is a servicable primer on the history, traditions, and scandals of 1,200 years of the monarchy in Britain.	2005-07-30

While few knights in the medieval period became aristocrats, all noblemen were knights, at least in theory. Beginning with the Conquest and the introduction of the feudal system, they were the ruling class by virtue of arms, though Coss also examines the Saxon roots of some aspects of knighthood. He also considers in some detail the relationship of the knight first to gentility and then to lordship, showing how the characteristics of knighthood were changed in the process. The book's only fault, in fact, is the lack of subject headings in the index.	2005-07-30

The family began its climb with the career of Alan de Neville, appointed justice of the forest by Henry II, a position in which he became somewhat notorious for his money-raising efforts on behalf of his king. He also sided with Henry against Thomas Beckett. Hugh Neville became chief forester under King John, to whom he was likewise loyal (most of the time) and for whom he likewise raised vast sums of money. Hugh was listed among those supporting the king in the preamble to Magna Carta. By this time, the Nevilles had established themselves in a number of counties and its members weren't always united as a family, but as a group their influence continued to grow. By the 14th century, the Nevilles were second only to the Percys in ruling the north of England, their power and influence culminating in Ralph de Neville, earl of Warwick, known as \\"the Kingmaker\\" for his shifting allegiance of one side or the other during the Wars of the Roses. This Ralph was the grandson of Ralph, lord of Raby and earl of Westmoreland, and Joan Beaufort, daughter of John of Gaunt, which gave him a connection to the throne himself. It all came to an end, though, at the Battle of Barnet in 1471, in which both the overmighty earl and his brother were killed and Edward IV was relieved of the Neville influence. Still, Ralph's aunt, Cicely Neville, was even Queen of England a decade later as the wife of Richard III. Young is more interested in the family's collective rise through royal service than in tracing exact lineages, which may frustrate genealogists, but this is a first-rate dynastic study and it includes an excellent bibliography.	2005-07-30

The 9th earl has an Oxford degree in modern history and a refreshingly unprotective attitude toward his own forebears (the probable descendants of Tudor sheep-farmers with no claim to a connection with the Le Despensers of Normandy, whatever family tradition says), who included some very iffy characters as well as art patrons, active politicians, and military heroes. Robert, the first Baron Spencer, was perhaps the wealthiest man in England. Henry Spencer, the first earl of Sunderland, gave Charles I the sum of £10,000 on the eve of the Civil War, then died on the battlefield, while his ruthless and over-ambitious son became politically influential but was widely disliked. Georgiana, the celebrated duchess of Devonshire in the 18th century, was a Spencer, but her sister, Lady Caroline Lamb, was Byron's mistress. George John, the second earl, was the patron of Horatio Nelson and built the largest private library in Europe -- but nearly bankrupted his family in the process. Sir Winston Churchill was a Spencer, too. The fifth earl was Viceroy of Ireland and served often in Gladstone's cabinet, but never succeeded in his ambition to become Prime Minister. (Apparently, the less said about the present earl's parents and step-parents, the better; the tabloids pretty much own that subject.) And through the centuries, the family has amassed and managed and conserved its wealth, built fine homes, collected fine art (and sat for Reynolds, Gainsborough, and Sargent), and gone about its business. While the history is anecdotal, not academic (although there's a good selected bibliography), this is a recommended treatment of one of the less-famous (until Diana) titled families in Britain. I'm also pleased to say that, despite her brother's well-publicized disapproval of the Windsors, the late princess gets only a brief mention at the end of the book; no tabloidism here. Finally, previous reviewers who complained about the author's claim of descent from the Despensers (actually, he dismisses any such family myth) and his lack of sources (there's quite a good bibliography) must not have read the same book I did.

He's also one of the several hundred American-born Japanese who was in Hiroshima in August 1945, an experience from which he will never, ever escape. He's not an important man by anyone's standards, he's not even very involved in anyone else's affairs (now that his wife is dead of cancer and his semi-estranged daughter has gone off to New York to be a film maker), but he has a few friends and many acquaintances among the other Japanese and Nisei in LA. One of them is a man known as Joji Haneda, whom he knew in Hiroshima, whom Mas has avoided seeing again for a couple of decades, because Joji is not what he appears. Now a young Japanese reporter, the grandson of a woman Mas also used to know, has turned up asking probing questions. And a local woman dies, with the grandson being blamed. And other Japanese are poking around, making trouble for Mas and his friends, and all the things Mas wants not to remember are coming back to haunt him -- especially about what happened to Joji Haneda. This book is marketed as a \\"mystery,\\" but Mas isn't a detective. He doesn't even think of what he's doing as solving a crime; he just has to make amends. (\\"Bachi\\" is the avenging spirit of retribution; \\"what goes around comes around.\\") This is one of those involving, absorbing stories that stays with you for weeks after you finish the book and put it back on the shelf. The characters are very fully realized, the Japanese under-community is brought completely to life, and the most ordinary, unheroic people show the depths of themselves. An amazing book.	2005-07-25

And not only have these long been the key Japanese attributes as seen by outsiders, this is also how Japanese have seen themselves, and how they still prefer to.<br /><br />Drawing on decades of social-psychology studies and scientific surveys, Matsumoto convincingly shows that, while these stereotypes were true in the past, even up into the economic boom days of the 1970s and even the 1980s, they are all absolutely inaccurate in describing Japan at the beginning of the 21st century. This is true to some extent all across society, but overwhelmingly so in the younger generations. Younger Japanese, especially, are more individualist and less collectivist than Americans. Employees are more in more in favor of pay and advancement based on ability, not merely seniority, and lifetime employment is very much a thing of the past. Young people no longer suppress their emotions and have rejected arranged marriages in favor of marriage-for-love. Because they are far more individualistic than previous generations, younger Japanese are also far more likely to commit violent crimes; the \\"shame culture\\" is also rapidly becoming a thing of the past. In other words, any outsider who lived in Japan even in 1990 would find a greatly changed country and culture if he returned there today. This book ought to be required reading for any novelist setting a story in Japan, for all writers of travel books, and for thoughtful Japanese themselves.han Americans.

When Victoria died in 1901, the world was a vastly different place than when she acceded to the throne in 1837. Britain had built a worldwide empire, had become dominant in the growth of technology and the production of everything from steel and steam engines to branded flour and disposable razor blades. Some time is spent on basic science, especially geology and fossils, and Darwin's inspired notion of evolution, but because it was made for television, most of the program (and the book) have to deal with the visible results of science. While there's a good deal of fascinating anecdotal history here -- gardener Joseph Paxton and his innovative design for the Crystal Palace, for instance, and the \\"Great Stink\\" caused by the long, hot summer of 1858 and the debate in Parliament that led to the building of London's sewer system (which also meant the end of cholera and typhoid and established Portland cement as a superior construction medium) -- but it's all a bit superficial. There are a few small errors, too: Temperature isn't measured in \\"kelvins,\\" but in Celsius-sized degrees on the Kelvin scale, which simply begins much lower. And (in the section on crime and the development of forensics) the author describes Sherlock Holmes \\"with his Ulster cape, his deerstalker hat and his magnifying glass.\\" But Conan Doyle never gave Holmes a deerstalker; that was added only in the Basil Rathbone films. It's interesting, too, how many inventions and innovations supposedly were made in or near Bristol, . . . where Hart-Davis just happens to come from. In my opinion, Burke's \\"Connections\\" series did all this better. But, still, it's a fun read.	2005-07-22

Servants -- especially those at the bottom of the pecking order, like scullery maids and \\"maids of all work\\" -- were grossly underpaid, often worked eighteen hours a day, could be fired at a moment's notice, and were generally treated by their employers as not quite human. A very large percentage of domestics were girls under twelve years of age. And yet the middle and upper classes constantly harped on the \\"servant problem\\" and their inability to get \\"good\\" servants. Their blindness to social inequity was not unlike the insistence of many slaveholders that their chattels were loyal out of love of the family they served! (It's amazing to me that there was never a bloody class revolution in Britain. . . .) Dawes does an excellent job detailing the service system with its layers of controls, how servants survived, the hierarchy imposed even below stairs (everyone has to feel superior to someone), hiring and firing practices, how those in service were kept in line by religious propaganda, and what was likely to happen to young women who resisted the advances of male members of the household. Dawes depends heavily on reminiscences of and correspondence from those who were servants in their youth, or whose parents were, because thirty years ago there still of lot of such people alive in Britain; this book couldn't be written today. There are quite a few excellent period illustrations, too.	2005-07-22

I've been a working (though non-teaching) historian for more than three decades, and while I'm familiar with historiographical theories, and cliometrics, and other purely intellectual pursuits, I still confess a preference for \\"tangible,\\" material history. Maybe it's my training as an archivist, but I get a serious thrill from seeing, perhaps even handling, an original document. If you mentioned \\"historic documents\\" to most people, they would think of the Declaration of Independence at the National Archives. My interests run somewhat earlier, however: I'd think first of Domesday Book, nearly five times as old as the Declaration, and arguably of far more pervasive influence on the U.S. Hallam is on the staff of the Public Record Office, where the Book is housed, so that's her first choice, too, together with Nennius's \\"History of the Britons,\\" the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and (of course) Magna Carta. But this gorgeously illustrated oversized volume goes on to portray a large number of original charters, treaties, and letters. Examples of William Caxton's printing are here, and a Shakespeare First Folio, and a list of the burgesses of the Virginia Company, and the Declaration of Rights with which Parliament hedged their offer of the throne to William and Mary. Then, in the modern period, you'll find correspondence of Prince Charles Stewart (the Young Pretender), and Clive writing home with news of his victories in India, and maps of the enclosures that accompanied the Agricultural Revolution, and Radical political pamphlets from the 1830s, and the manuscript of _Pickwick Papers,_ right up to beer advertisements from the 1890s (deposited at the PRO to register copyright), police reports of the arrest of suffragettes, Edward VIII's Instrument of Abdication, and Paul McCartney's handwritten lyrics to \\"Yesterday.\\" The accompanying text is excellent and I've spent many pleasant hours perusing the illustrations.	2005-07-22

The chapters walk the reader through the major elements of a blazon: The shield itself and its divisions and partitions, the charges, the helm and mantling, the crest and supporters, the various systems of differencing and cadency, and the marshalling of arms. But the author, a German-born artist of American citizenship living in Antwerp, has published a number of heraldic works in German, Dutch, and Danish, as well as English, and his interest in Continental armory continues here, with discussions of burgher-arms, both the titled and untitled nobility of numerous European countries, and the religious orders of chivalry in Malta, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Since most works on the subject in English show little interest in heraldry outside the British Isles, that inclusion alone makes this an important reference tool. But the author also points out the family relationships displayed in the similar arms of families with a joint history, the similarities between many municipal and regional arms based on historical parallels, and even the peculiarities of practice in the way helms are traditionally rendered in different countries. Much incidental information on both British and Continental families also appears. For instance, the arms of the noble Pacchioni family of Bologna includes a modified version of the chief in the Angevin arms because the armiger was a supporter of the King of Nables and Sicily, and the arms of Edward Irving of Kirkintilloch include a brisure of a second son of a third son of a second son. An excellent tool for both the genealogist and the heraldic artist.	2005-07-15

This very detailed history of the origins and duties of the medieval herald, the court of chivalry, the often eccentric personalities of later heralds and their effects on the orders of knighthood (Knights of the Garter very nearly became hereditary in the eighteenth century, for instance), and the problematic role of the herald in the twentieth century, is a surprisingly engrossing social history of Britiain from a peculiar viewpoint. Wagner also was noted for a certain drollery in his narrative that may catch the reader off-guard.<br /><br />NOTE: For broader coverage of the same and related topics, see Wagner's _Heralds and Heraldry in the Middle Ages: An Inquiry into the Growth of the Armorial Function of Heralds_ (London: Oxford University Press, 1939).	2005-07-15

(She eventually proved a connection to three of them.) In these hundred pages, she recounts the research she undertook in the United States and then the adventures encountered and results obtained on three visits to England. Although she seems to rely on such questionable sources as _Burke's Peerage,_ she also spent many hours at the Society of Genealogists library in London, searching through primary sources and old manuscript lineages. There were errors of interpretation (what looked like \\"Hadbury\\" on a chart turned out to be a poorly-written \\"Fladbury\\") and serendipitous discoveries while driving about in Warwickshire and Yorkshire and hunting up people with the key to the local church. She studied the history of memorial brasses (having found 14th and 15th century brasses of eight of her own ancestors), made friends of cab drivers (who, years later, were still sending her clippings of interest from the local newspaper), and generally enjoyed the chase immensely. Undertaking such a project myself, I would have delved much more deeply into the available records on microfilm and would have consulted with other researchers and librarians -- she seems not to have heard of the Inter-Library Loan system -- before flying off to Heathrow with a much more complete and precise itinerary. Also, as is the case with self-published volumes of history and genealogy, this account of Mrs. Schieffelin's labors would have been improved by the attentions of a good editor. Nevertheless, while the style is a bit gushy and the technique sometimes naive, it's a lot of fun to read.	2005-07-15

A hundred years later, Clovis conquered the region for the French. Then came the armies of Islam, and the hereditary counts of Toulouse became a bulwark of Christian Europe, with all the international political leverage that entailed. By the beginning of the 13th century, Toulouse, now virtually independent, also controlled Armagnac, Foix, Carcassonne, Narbonne, and much of Provence, and had become ancestors of both the kings of France and the Angevin kings of England. Heavily chronological in organization, this well-written volume outlines the successive rulers of Toulouse down to 1271, when Raymond VII's lack of male progeny and the death of his only daughter allowed Philip III to annex the wealthy county to the French crown. Genty provides numerous details for each individual profiled, which is especially useful in the early medieval period. It helps to read some French, of course, but basic data can be extracted without that facility. Descent charts are peculiarly French in style but are easy enough to use, and a brief bibliography will lead the reader to more in-depth histories and biographies -- in French, of course.	2005-07-14

They shared an unusual continuity of personality and appearance and Victoria ended by being the ancestress of every present ruling house and pretender in Europe, excepting only the Bonapartists. \\"The path of events that led a German prince, who could not speak a word of English, to the throne of Great Britain was a devious one,\\" the author notes. It all began with Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James I, who married Frederick the Elector Palatine; it eventually caught up the houses of Brunswick and Hesse, the imperial Prussian and Russian families, and finally the Saxe-Coburgs, in the person of Prince Albert. But the German newcomers had also to deal with the British parliament -- an experience very foreign to the absolute rulers of small German states, as were the revolutions in the American colonies and France. Lord North, Charles Fox, the Pitts, Lord Melbourne, Robert Peel, and on through Disraeli and Gladstone, all made their mark in either supporting or limiting the Hanoverians, and Britain moved finally from autocratic rule to constitutional government. A competently constructed overview of the last age of unencumbered monarchy in Britain's history.	2005-07-14

Besides the millions of ordinary Irishmen who carry the name of O'Brien, he was the progenitor of the earls of Thormond, the viscounts Clare, earls of Lismore, viscounts Tallow, and the earls of Inchiquin. Because Irish Catholic peers sometimes found it wise to remove to the Continent, there are also titled branches of the family in France and the Netherlands. In fact, Patricic Maurice MacMahon (the MacMahons are a sept of the O'Briens) was Marshall of France, Duke of Majenta, and President of the French Republic, 1873-1879. An illustrious family indeed, and the author, who is a younger son of the 14th Baron Inchiquin, outlines it all very clearly, including junior branches of the family in Waterford, Cork, and Tipperary.

All these made up English political society, not just for the great dukes and earls but also for the lesser peers and the gentry who formed the power base in the counties. The author thoroughly examines the English social structure, discussing what contemporaries meant when they talked of the nobility and analyzing in detail the territorial and familial policies of the great landholders. For instance, although William the Conqueror did not, as a matter of policy, dispossess the Anglo-Saxon nobility, that is, in fact, what had happened by the time of Domesday Book, twenty years later. By 1086, there were, at the top of society, about 170 great tenants-in-chief, men who held their land directly from the king, and enough of it to be described as barons. All but two of these men were Norman (or Breton, or Fleming). Among them, these 170 controlled about half the land of England. Another seventeen percent of the land was retained by William as his own demesne, and another quarter of the land was granted to the Church. The remaining eight percent was divided among all the other lesser tenants-in-chief and the minor royal officials. But even so, there were immense differences at the top, with Robert, count of Mortain (the king's brother), controlling a hundred times as much territory and income as, say, Robert of Aumale. In fact, about one-quarter of England was in the hands of ten men: Robert of Mortain, Odo of Bayeux (the king's other brother), William FitzOsbern, Roger de Montgomery, William de Warenne, Hugh d'Avranches, Eustace of Boulogne, Richard de Clare, Geoffrey of Coutances, and Geoffrey de Mandeville.<br /><br />Given-Wilson also probes the surprising fact that no really great noble dynasts emerged in England during the 12th century -- a family that might compare in wealth and status with the great peers of France or the dukes and margraves of Germany. (It was mostly a combination of geographical dispersion of landholdings and much greater social fluidity than that of the 14th century.) The author is also careful to provide examples of his points from a large number of noble families of interest to the genealogist. The historical maps detailing the manor holdings of the Nevils, Berkeleys, Clares, Montagues, Beauchamps, Percys, Cliffords, Fitzalans, Mowbrays, and Beauforts are enlightening and the notes and bibliography are very extensive.combination of geographical dispersion of landholdings and much greater social fluidity than that of the 14th century.)

The introductory first half of the volume treats the aristocracy as a class of individuals of high status and privilege, discusses the isolation of social rank, describes the sorting out of families into greater or lesser ranks (and of greater or lesser influence over the king), and provides a case study of the way an elite group is created and defined. It's useful to know, for instance, that Edward never meant to create a peerage out of his great lords and vassals -- certainly he never intended that they would acquire the ability to circumscribe the royal power. There are also numerous sidebar discussions of individual peers and dynasties.<br /><br />The second half of the book comprises a collection of seventy-six documents that shed light on a wide variety of topics, including the text of a summons to Parliament in 1313, the impeachment of Suffolk in 1450, the ritual of an earl's burial, minutes of debate in the House of Lords in 1449, an accounting of John of Gaunt's household expenses in 1383, a bond by the earl of Shrewsbury in 1468 to keep the peace and not bother the earl Grey or his retainers, a mythical history of the earls of Warwick (as claimed by themselves), the foundation of Bisham Priory in 1339 by the Montagues, and the granting of a royal pension in 1388 to the widow of the earl of Oxford.	2005-07-14

The tradition of consciously educating the heir to the throne in anything more than the military arts began with the Tudors and the Renaissance. The young Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth -- all of whom became monarchs in their turn -- were true prodigies, with what seems almost a genetic gift for languages, politics, geography, theological discourse (high intellectual sport in those days), and especially music. Elizabeth I is reckoned to have been perhaps the most gifted and certainly the most academically prepared woman in Europe at the time. The unfortunate Jane Grey was even more brilliant -- though, according to her instructors, she lacked the mental flexibility required of a successful ruler; had she lived and retained the throne she might have become the Protestant equivalent of the intolerant Mary I. Education didn't come so easily to the Stewarts but they persevered and were generally successful -- at least academically. The Hanoverian offspring were quite another matter, producing enough black sheep to turn any tutor's hair white. An interesting account of the transformation of extraordinary children into kings and queens.	2005-07-14

In 1931, a bronze commemorative tablet was erected at Falaise in Normandy which included the names of 315 men who were claimed to be proven Companions of the Conqueror, but even that number turns out to be too large by more than a factor of ten. The names were taken from several sources: Guillaume de Poitiers, who was William's chaplain; Bishop Guy of Amiens, almoner to Queen Matilda, who wrote a Latin poem on the battle; Guillaume de Jumieges, who dedicated his _Gesta Normanorum_ to the Conqueror; Roger du Mont and Robert Torigny, who continued that work; Oderic Vital, a monk born nine years after Hastings, who spent several years in England collecting evidence on the battle; and Wace, a Jersey-born poet born in 1100 who mentions 118 knights by name in his _Roman de Rou_. The Bayeux Tapestry is another source which names a very few of those present at Hastings. The principal source for the list of Companions was for many years the Roll of Battle Abbey, but that was shown in the past century to be very unreliable. Dr. T. R. Thomson, spurred by the Falaise celebrations, re-examined the sources in a key article late in 1931, and the following year Geoffrey H. White read an important paper before the Society of Genealogists confirming Thomson's conclusions. Prof. David C. Douglas went back to the beginning in another major paper in 1944 and White published an extensive commentary on that effort, as well. And how many Companions' names have survived this rigorous academic process? Nineteen -- fifteen of them certain and four others highly probable. All, of course (with the exception of Bishop Odo), were founders of great noble families in England.<br /><br />All the articles mentioned above have been conveniently reprinted in this slender volume, together with a list of all the names claimed by all the sources, including six variant copies of the Battle Abbey Roll, the Falaise Roll of 1931, and Leopold Delisle's Dives Roll, published in 1863.<br /><br />This book is a key source not only for sorting out the claims of various ancient families to ancestral presence at Hastings, but also as a nearly complete list of all those families whose progenitors showed up in England anywhere from a year to several generations later.s, including six variant copies of the Battle Abbey Roll, the Falaise Roll of 1931, and Leopold Delisle's Dives Roll, published in 1863.<br /><br />This book is a key source not only for sorting out the claims of various ancient families to ancestral presence at Hastings, but also as a nearly complete list of all those families whose progenitors showed up in England anywhere from a year to several generations later.	2005-07-14

The documentable history of the latter begins with the turn of the 12th century, but family legends go back much farther -- including a claimed link to one of the Twelve Peers of Charlemagne. They moved up in power over a number of generations, reaching the stations of Grand Constable and Grand Domestic, until John Kantakouzenos became emperor as John VI in 1347. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the family's history becomes much more obscure for a century or more. Although large numbers of Kantakuzenes appeared later in Greece, Romania, and Italy, their connections to the imperial branch are not at all clear, so Nicol chooses to ignore them entirely. However, he discusses in greater or lesser detail more than 100 individuals over a period of three and a half centuries, plus all their dynastic relations, and includes many descent charts. He also provides a great many source notes and a lengthy bibliography, so this volume has a claim to being the standard scholarly reference on the Kantakouzenos family in English.	2005-07-14

Godfrey's grandson, Richard FitzGilbert, took part in the Conquest and became the first Norman lord of Clare, serving also as co-regent of England during the king's absences. William rewarded his cousins well, granting them enormous fiefs in half a dozen counties. They became earls of Gloucester and Hereford and heirs to the earldoms of Ulster and March. They were active for generations in the Welsh and Scots wars and produced some of the most highly regarded (and feared) politicians and diplomats in England.

The upstart Sforzi of Milan, the ancient Este family of Ferrara, the Montefeltri of Urbino, the Gonzagas of Mantua, and the Aragonese kings of Naples were matched by popes such as Sixtus IV, \\"who did much to lower the already low standards of the papacy,\\" and his cousin, Julius II, patron of Michelangelo,who also delighted in making war. And there were the Borgias, who seemed to antagonize everyone on the peninsula. These were men (and some women) of their times, grim and gaudy, and few have been the subjects of individual biographies. Prescott obviously is fascinated by his subjects but he recognizes them for what they were; the result is a finely-drawn portrait gallery of the Italian generation who had so much to do with shaping our own world.	2005-07-14

Working from the particular to the general, she investigates in detail the lives, activities, policies, landholdings, and connections among three of the lesser baronial families in northern Shropshire, on the Welsh marches. The main thing these families had in common was the western frontier of Norman authority, which dominated their lives. To the marcher barons, 13th century England bore little resemblance to what was recorded by the monastic chroniclers; to them, Henry III was a good king who knew his place and Edward I was a dangerous upstart. With their private army, the Corbets lived like uncrowned kings in their own domain, and it was a marcher castle that led the Fitz Warins to rebel against King John. Much of this thoroughly scholarly work concerns land ownership and politics on the frontier, but of particular interest to us genealogists is the detailed lineage and family history the author provides of each of these relatively obscure baronial families.	2005-07-14

Three of these, dealing with affairs in the North, are of special interest to us: \\"A Tudor Magnate and the Tudor State,\\" which deals with Henry Percy, 5th earl of Northumberland, who was remarkable for being able to successfully assert his will on Henry VIII; \\"Change and Continuity in the Tudor North,\\" which investigates the activities of Thomas Wharton, 1st baron Wharton, a typical border lord in the Scottish marches on half of the king, and who was closely connected with the D'Acres and other great Cumberland families; and \\"The First Earl of Cumberland and the Rise of Northern Feudalism,\\" which investigates the ways in which Henry VIII reluctantly found it necessary to depend on the nobility in maintaining order in his kingdom, in this case Henry Clifford, whose family thrived following a strategic marriage with the Viponts. The author's clear and easy style balances his strongly academic approach and makes his work quite accessible even to nonspecialists.	2005-07-11

Any monarch is associated with individuals whose influence they inevitably will feel, whether that influence is sought by either side or not. Victoria was no exception  through her long reign, but the sort of people with whom she surrounded herself changed as she aged -- and especially after the death of the Prince Consort, when the Queen went into near-seclusion. Some of those who had her ear were, naturally, aristocrats, and some of those were politicians, especially Lord Melbourne during her earlier reign. Others came from the upper middle class, like Disraeli (whom she admired) and Gladstone (whom she disliked almost to paranoia). Still others were household staff and servants, including Sir Henry Ponsonby, her tactful private secretary, her doctor, Sir William Jenner (who was completely under her thumb), and John Brown, her rough-hewn \\"gillie\\" and personal servant whom both the court and her own children despised. And as her children grew up and married into European royal and noble families, Victoria began an intense correspondence, especially with her eldest daughter, Victoria, mother of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who also tried to influence British affairs through his grandmother in her last years. The author brings his attention to detail and sense of style to this first-rate study of the \\"off the record\\" side of a monarch's existence.	2005-07-11

It's still one of the most reliable printed sources around. Throughout the chapters on colors, ordinaries, charges, helmets, heraldic beasts and plants, differencing, and royal heraldry, are interspersed brief and often witty historical essays, genealogical anecdotes, thoughtful speculation as to the origins of various devices, and detailed comments on proper interpretation by heraldic artists. Franklyn assumes some knowledge of English history, and while there is a scattering of color plates, the 465 annotated black-and-white illustrations are far more useful.	2005-07-11

Taking as her theme the idea that \\"the queen is what the queen does,\\" Hayden proposes that the Sovereign -- or at least this Sovereign -- has far more influence, both politically and socially, than might generally be thought or that the English constitution might envision. She does it both by distancing herself, personally and ceremonially, from her subjects, but also by drawing in the aristocracy (the closest people available who resemble herself) for close support. This mechanism can be seen in action every time the royal family poses on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, and by noting the long list of things the queen simply does not do, such as attend the funerals of non-royals, give anything away (ever), or permit anyone else to initiate a conversation in her presence. This puts her on a higher plane than ordinary mortals. Moreover, much of what is regarded as \\"ancient\\" ritual dates only from the early 20th century; Victoria was a very different sort of monarch, and a much less astute one. Hayden does an excellent job of explaining the royal system as it operates in Britain, and her insights also help to explain later events -- such as the Royal Family's ham-handed confusion at the outpouring of popular grief on the death of Princess Diana.	2005-07-11

His editorship of Burke's Peerage and his long list of scholarly publications notwithstanding, Pine's greatest contribution to the peerage may be his skill at sheer storytelling. Strictly a non-reference book, this delightful volume discourses ingenuously on the ups and downs of a dozen impeccable British families, from the Howards (who rose from obscurity to the rank of senior peers of the realm, the dukes of Norfolk, in only a couple of centuries) and the Grosvenors (who took more than twice as long to become the fabulously wealthy dukes of Westminster) to the Nelsons (whose earls have no blood connection whatever with the naval genius of the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar) and the Wellesleys (whose progenitor, the \\"Iron Duke,\\" spent more years as a politician than as a military man). Then there are the De Courcys, who descend from a proven Companion of the Conqueror but have seldom risen above obscurity, and the Wavells, a family that frequently produced talented civil and military servants of the Crown (and were also involved in the colonization of Texas, in which they got shafted by Stephen F. Austin). Filling his work with anecdotes from both his own researches and personal experiences and with the results of the work of his many correspondents, Pine is very entertaining but still careful and accurate.	2005-07-11

There's not a baronial manor that doesn't feature heraldic symbols everywhere they can be portrayed, a sort of billboard advertising the dignity of the resident family. More than fifty sumptuous homes are featured in this coffee table volume, including Tattershall Castle, property of the Cromwells, Blickling Hall, which belonged to the earls of Buckinghamshire, and Baddesley Clinton, seat of the Ferrers family, of medieval origins. There are more than a hundred full color plates and illustrations, plus another hundred heraldric line drawings. In explaining the symbolism depicted and the uses made of it, the authors include a great deal of anecdotal history of the great aristocratic families. A treasure trove for art and architecture historians as well as heraldicists.	2005-07-08

He was Leader of the House of Lords more than once, served in several governments, and was an ardent foe of pornography -- and was also a favorite of the tabloids for some of his other reformist causes. Still, he was an hereditary peer and sat in the House for more than a half-century, and while he was dubious about its place in modern, semi-socialist Britain, he obviously had considerable affection for \\"the best club in the world.\\" He begins by describing a typical day in the workings of the House, noting who attends and who doesn't, and trying to explain why party politics has less hold there than one might expect. Then he goes back to the Conquest to examine the roots of the institution in the feudal summonses issued by a succession of early kings. By 1377, the House was beginning to \\"settle down,\\" just in time to become a force in the dynastic disputes between the Yorkists  and the Lancastrians, and the roots of much of the aristocracy's wealth dates from Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries (their properties being parceled out to his favorites and supporters). The \\"Golden Years\\" came, he says, under the Hanoverians, which was followed by seventy-five years under the control of the Victorian Tories. The arrival of something resembling modern democracy in the 20th century led to great changes in the House, and the postwar Labor victory brought even more changes. But still, the long-threatened dissolution of the upper house, long an item in the Labor agenda, has yet to happen, and the author examines the possible reasons for that, too. While this is not at all a scholarly work, it's a very readable overview and introduction to an ancient British institution, the author's prejudices and bugbears notwithstanding.	2005-07-08

Though not a scholar in the academic sense, Plowden has a pretty good reputation as a knowledgeable writer of accessible history, as well as being a well-known producer of history series for the BBC. This volume, which grew out of a popular Radio 4 series, traces the lineages and history of seven of the oldest families in Britain's ruling class: the Percys of Northumberland, the Sackvilles (once dukes of Dorset), the Stanleys (earls of Derby), the Howards (dukes of Norfolk and preeminent peers of the realm), the Russells (dukes of Bedford), the Cavendishes (dukes of Devonshire), and the Spencers (an ancient family and Earls Spencer, but best known now as the family of Princess Diana). All can trace their origins to Norman barons, except the Cavendishes, whose recorded history begins \\"only\\" with a 14th century lord mayor of London. As powerful servants of the Crown, these families wielded power, administered the country, fought foreign enemies (and sometimes each other), filled diplomatic posts, and spent most of the 20th century watching their revenues and lands shrink and their influence diminish. Still, those who predict the extinction of the British peerage should pay attention to the historical adaptive abilities of the most successful of these highly-placed families. Plowden supplies enough anecdotes to maintain readability for the nonspecialist, but there is also a highly selected bibliography (but no footnotes).	2005-07-08

What influence might these intimates of a reigning queen or of the monarch's spouse have had, however peripheral, on the making of policy? Somerset (who doesn't say whether she's connected in any way to the ducal house) is an \\"amateur historian,\\" but a good one. She concentrates on court politics beginning with Henry VIII, partly because detailed records are too sparse in this regard prior to Bosworth, and partly because Henry VII only kept great state because it was expected of a king, but his son enjoyed it immensely and greatly expanded the number of offices at court. Because it can be difficult to find narrative histories of many of the families discussed here, like the Pomfrets, the Sundons, and the Cowpers, the genealogies woven into the footnoted text are especially welcome.	2005-07-08

Beginning with the early Celtic kings who brought some form of organization to early British (and Welsh and Irish) society, Cannon escorts the reader through the island's history, reign by reign, from Rædwald of the East Angles to Elizabeth II, tracing the waxing and waning of the monarch's personal power, noting royal marriages and interments, wars and treaties, glorious victories and humiliating failures. A great deal of the personal is included along with the politics, as when the young Edward VI coolly notes the execution in 1552 of his uncle, the Duke of Somerset, and the exasperated Queen Anne's attempts in 1703 to reason with her Whig ministers. The numerous illustrations, many in color, add to the flavor of the narrative as well as the reader's understanding. This book may be the only general history of the British monarchy that any student would ever need.	2005-07-08

Yes, there are exceptions. No one doubts the active nature of Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom Henry II found it expedient to lock away, and Henry VIII's repudiation of Catherine of Aragon was of momentous historical importance to the English -- but what about Matilda of Boulogne, who was utterly unable to control or even to moderate the chaos caused by King Stephen? Or Berengaria of Navarre, pro forma wife of the possibly homosexual Richard I? (Cook calls her \\"the first unlucky Spanish-born English queen.\\") Or Mary of Teck, George V's queen? (Though, after Parliament took control of the nation for good, it's debatable whether even the king could have any significant power, much less the queen.) Since she has to cover thirty-seven royal spouses, the author, a professional archaeologist with an M.A. from Oxford, is unable to spend much time on any one of them, but her writing style is clear and concise and this is a pretty good non-scholarly introduction to the other side of the throne. On the other hand, I found several relatively minor errors, such as the misattributed parentage of Edith of Scotland and inaccurate details about Neville \\"the Kingmaker,\\" earl of Warwick, which leads me to wonder how many errors I didn't see.	2005-07-08

She's writing this book at the request of her psychologist as a way of introducing the ship's somewhat peculiar orbital society, of which she and her friends are the carefully planned carriers, to the people still surviving on a war- and disease-ravaged Earth. Individualism has been proven not to work, so their new social system is based strongly on cooperation and teamwork, and being an \\"Uncooperative\\" is a criminal offense. Things start to change when Theophilus joins their class -- a \\"groundhog\\" whose parents have joined the company that owns the ship -- and he thinks in a very divisive way that challenges their view of what's right, and he's a jerk besides. Mel, together with her brother and her new boyfriend, are destined for a different sort of role, though. Barnes lets Mel tell her story on her own terms, so the reader has to figure out and try to understand the differences between her world and ours, and he's pretty successful at it; I'm tempted to compare this book to a Heinlein juvenile, but it's not really like that. For one thing, it's not really written for adolescents. Pretty good anthropological science fiction.	2005-07-04

The humor is often sly, frequently ditzy (so what *does* the \\"ho\\" mean in \\"Heave-ho\\"?), but sometimes a little oblique (which means I didn't always get the joke).

Which means those strips that begin in media res are apt to go right over my head, since I'm not familiar with previous plot-lines, but that's not necessarily a fault of the publication. Artistically, the most successful one in this collection is probably \\"The Many Worlds of Tesla Strong,\\" which is also the longest. Eric Shanower's \\"Promethea\\" is also pretty good, a take-off on the 1900-style art of \\"Little Nemo,\\" but with some sly 2000-style social asides. The least successful has to be \\"The Cobweb,\\" which is done in a junior-high-school-amateur style that I can't take seriously.

The other buildings discussed and pictured include Windsor Castle, Holyroodhouse, Blenheim Palace, Cardiff Castle, the Grand Hotel at St. Pancras Station, and Tower Bridge, all of which have obvious iconic status, . . . so why wrap up the volume with Highpoint One, a modernist apartment building from the 1930s, which probably no one has ever heard of? (Or maybe that's his point.) I've rubbernecked in and around most of these buildings over the years (never been to Scotland, though), and I have my own favorites: St. Pancras is delightful in its Victorian-industrial, take-no-prisoners, brick-and-iron lushness, and Durham Cathedral's soaring Gothic spacees get right into my bones. On the other hand, Blenheim has to be one of the ugliest palaces ever conceived -- an object lesson in what happens when you're spending Other People's Money.

The first story, \\"The Very Pulse of the Machine,\\" about time travel and dinosaurs, is really pretty good -- but it's also the basis for a chapter in his latest novel, _Bones of the Earth_ (only slightly rewritten) so I already knew where it was going. \\"Mother Grasshopper\\" didn't make a lot of sense, nor did \\"In Concert,\\" nor did \\"Ancient Engines.\\" I couldn't even finish several of the others. \\"North of Diddy-Wah-Diddy\\" was more straightforward, but the author was trying too hard with that one. Maybe the best thing in the volume, actually, is \\"Radiant Doors,\\" about time-traveling refugees from future fascism (maybe) and whether people get what they deserve.

It's one of the tropes of time-travel novels: A guy finds a time machine in the present, then travels to the past and leaves it there so it will be found in the present, so he can travel to the past, etc. So, who invented the time machine? Is there even more than one in the universe? In this case, the finder is Howard Christian, eccentric multi-billionaire, sort of a cross between Howard Hughes and Bill Gates, and the time machine -- an array of colored marbles in an aluminum briefcase -- is discovered next to a frozen Pleistocene mammoth in northern Canada. To get the machine to work again, Howard hires Matthew Wright, genius mathematician and world expert on theoretical time travel. Matt, a true geek, nevertheless hits it off with Susan Morgan, elephant trainer and DVM, who's involved in another of Howard's projects, trying to recover viable mammoth sperm from the frozen specimen. And then things get crazy, the time machine activates itself (maybe), and suddenly Los Angeles is knee-deep in big, hairy pachyderms. Not much of this novel is really \\"science\\" fiction, being concerned more with the personalities of and interactions among the three main characters, the nature of large, intelligent mammals, and the more fanatical side of the \\"animal rights\\" movement, with a passing jab at government interrogation methods under the Patriot Act.

Christopher is also a math near-genius, but that's largely because of his \\"unnatural\\" ability to concentrate on something to the exclusion of the rest of the world. He's frightened of crowds (too many strangers) and places he's never been before (too much new information to assimilate all at once), he's very literal about what people say, and he doesn't like things that are brown or yellow. Or his food touching on the plate, or various other imperfections that turn up in his world. He mostly recognizes his own social limitations (such as not understanding metaphors), so with the help of Siobhan, a particularly good teacher at his special school, he's developed a number of coping strategies. But this isn't to say that he's mentally deficient in any way: He has an eidetic memory back to age four, and he's been studying for his maths A-levels, fully expecting to get an \\"A\\" grade. Though his assumption that he'll someday be a scientist may be wishful thinking -- or maybe not. And many of his odd perceptions are perfectly logical, when he explains them. But you learn all these facets of Christopher's personality and the world in which he exists while he relates the mystery he has decided to solve: Who killed the neighbor's poodle with a gardening fork? His detecting leads him into discoveries of things he might be better off not knowing. And so Christopher has to be brave and undertake a journey on his own to London, he has to cope with very different people and places and situations, and even though he's frightened most of the time, he handles it all pretty well. I found it easy to empathize with this kid as I have a few borderline tics similar to his (no one in my house knows how to properly load the dishwasher but me), but I'm not sure I could do so well if I were in his situation. I also like his thoroughly objective view of the world, which is actually more accurate than that of most people.

This book resulted from a stint as Tokyo bureau chief for the Post, during which his wife and two young daughters lived there with him, attending the schools and visiting Korea, Malaysia, and the other economically high-powered states of the coming \\"Asian Century.\\" His principal thesis is that while the Japanese \\"economic miracle\\" has received much attention in the West, their \\"social miracle\\" is at least as important. Japan is now the world's second wealthiest nation, but still one of the safest, most civil, best educated, and most stable nations in the world -- unlike the U.S., with a crime rate a hundred times worse than Japan's, declining education, and increasing economic disparity between the top and bottom of society. He attributes all this largely to the degree to which Confucian values permeate every facet of Japanese life -- and his chapter on just what those values comprise is one of the best and clearest I have ever seen. His chapter on the Japanese system of lifetime employment, though, is more problematic. The idea of major corporations sacrificing efficient production for a more stable society is also Confucian at its heart, and Reid explains it all very well. But while that system as still going strong in the mid-1990s, Japan's economy continues to sag, and they may not be able to keep it up; I wish he would do an updated edition on that issue alone. Excellent reading, though.	2005-06-23

Like, what is a maid of all work? What's this about eating at an ordinary? Does a priest \\"taking orders\\" mean he's waiting tables? (Real question from a student!) All these things were everyday, commonplace knowledge at the time, but the world has changed a great deal. Pool does a very commendable job of answering those questions, conducting the reader on a tour, in the first half of the book, through the basics of English society (currency, calendar, measurements); the public sphere of titled folks, Society with a capital S, the workings of power, status, and the Establishment; transportation (horse, carriage, coach, and railway); life in the country (including fox hunting); the private world of family relationships, servants, clothing, and food; and the \\"grim world\\" of work, disease, death, and being orphaned. I know quite a bit about all this, actually, but I still learned a few things -- such as the fact that a valet often ironed his master's newspaper not because it was wrinkled, but because the paper usually was delivered with the ink still damp and smudgy. The second half of the volume is 150 pages of glossary, with short definitions of terms like ague, knacker, growler, marchioness, and mangle. But keep in mind that Pool wrote this book to assist readers of Victorian fiction, not as a general history. You won't find much about factory conditions or the Crimean War, for instance, because those topics were never the subject of the great novels. There's also a pretty good brief bibliography, for those who want to pursue further some of the subjects treated. My only gripe, actually, is the author's sometimes annoying style. He sometimes seems a bit full of himself, with a tendency to show off his arcane knowledge, and he's addicted to the hedge-word \\"apparently.\\" What's wrong with a simple declarative sentence?with a tendency to show off his arcane knowledge, and he's addicted to the hedge-word \\"apparently.\\" What's wrong with a simple declarative sentence?	2005-06-22

At Your Door: A Survival Guide to Customs & Etiquette)	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Pretty good installment in an excellent series	Outside the U.S., my two favorite cities in the world are London and Tokyo, and it's far more difficult to find reliable, up-to-date information on the latter, especially with the economic ups and downs Japan has experienced in the past decade. (London mostly just keeps on keeping on.) This series is aimed not at the tourist but at the person who expects to be living, and probably working, in a new cultural environment for an extended period. Sure, you want to know about restaurants and what sights to see, but of more immediate importance is discovering how you go about getting the electricity turned on, and figuring out the subway system, and -- especially in a non-European country like Japan -- knowing how not to look like an idiot and avoid offending your host. The author covers all those things and many more, with sections on introducing children to Tokyo (they'll learn the language much more quickly than you), transportation (forget buying a car), the health care system (keep plenty of cash on hand for emergency medical treatment, because most hospitals and clinics don't take plastic and hardly anyone in Tokyo accepts checks), and many other subjects of interest to the new arrival. My only complaint is that the book received insufficient editing; there are far too many typos, missing words, and awkward sentences. And the index, frankly, is pathetic. But what the author actually has to say is very much worth hearing.	2005-06-22

The authors all were well known and trustworthy and their treatment of old subjects (such as basic research principles) and not so old (setting up a genealogy web site) was generally quite well done. But this one is somewhat different. The subject of \\"genetic genealogy\\" is still very much unknown territory to almost all genealogists, even the professionals. It's not even a \\"social science,\\" so one has to acquire a certain amount of new background knowledge even before delving into it. This author is also less likely to be known to most genealogists outside his own specialty: He's a medical doctor, a Section Chief at the National Institutes of Health -- although he has also been president of the Prince George's County Genealogical Society and chairs the NGS committee on Family Health and Heredity, so he certainly can't be called a beginner. Personally, I've been \\"doing genealogy\\" for more than three decades, but my background is in history, library science, and archival management, with no training and very little experience in the life sciences. Over the past few years, I've read dozens of articles in all sorts of journals on the subject of applying recent breakthroughs in DNA mapping to family lineages, but even though I've been intrigued by the possibilities, the result has generally been to confuse myself even further. I'm pleased to say that Shawker has supplied an antidote to my ignorance.<br /><br />The first section lays out the reasons you need to know about your family's health history, because \\"ignorance is not bliss.\\" This is especially true among Acadian families, as in other geographically or culturally isolated populations (Ashkenazic Jews, Amish, Afrikaners, Pacific Islanders) which suffer from a predisposition to assorted diseases and conditions. He follows this with a primer on the nature and process of genetics that is very well written and easy to understand (even for me), with a full explanation of dominant and recessive traits. He includes plenty of case studies, too, from King George III and the Romanovs to Gilda Radner. Then comes a section on compiling a health history, drawing up a medical pedigree, interpreting the results, and being aware of the warning signs for various important and common genetic diseases.<br /><br />The part of the book I read most closely is that which explains in great detail, with many examples and illustrations, how the Y-chromosome is passed on, unchanged, from father to son to grandson, and so on, through the male line, and how the mitochondrial DNA is likewise passed without change from mother to daughter to granddaughter. The famous Thomas Jefferson-Sally Hemmings case provides a good example of how all this works, and how one can use deduction to track lineages that are a mix of males and females. Numerous charts and diagrams also increase one's understanding. Shawker also lays out a strategy for developing a family association DNA project to determine the relationships between groups with identical surnames, and he repeatedly makes the point that no testing program can prove anything: It can only serve as another research tool in conjunction with more traditional genealogical methods.<br /><br />Finally, the author addresses the ethical and legal issues inherent in genetic testing, whether for family research or to identify an inherited tendency to contract a disease, and includes a lengthy guide to other resources on the Internet - especially important in a fast-developing area like this. There's an excellent bibliography, too. Shawker is that rare scientist who can write coherently for the layman and I can recommend this excellent work to any individual or library with an interest in genealogical methodology.with a primer on the nature and process of genetics that is very well written and easy to understand (even for me), with a full explanation of dominant and recessive traits.

Virginia did not pass a vital records act until 1853, and many Virginia courthouses were damaged or destroyed in the Civil War. And South Carolina did not require recording of marriages until 1911, so newspaper notices are important for both states. Holcomb has built a strong reputation in his series of publications of South Carolina records, and he maintains that with ease in this volume. Rather than simply abstracting the names and dates (which would be quicker and take less space), he extracts the relevant material. For instance, the death notice of Moses Wiley in February 1847 notes that he died \\"at the residence of his brother, near Mt. Zion, in Hancock County\\" at the age of 74, adding that he was born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, came to Virginia \\"with his father in 1787, a youth of about 15 years,\\" and that he served in the army under Gen. Floyd in 1814. Lots of good information and clues for further research there. In September 1847, Mrs. Martha A. Mosby died in Charlottesville, \\"wife of Mr. Benjamin Mosby, and daughter of the late Mr. Wm. Peake, of Caroline [County],\\" leaving an \\"infant daughter less than a month old.\\" She was an assistant at Charlottesville Female Academy from 1839 \\"until her marriage in October 1845.\\" I wish I could find a few family obituaries that extensive.	2005-06-20

The author's family have been Houmeans (Houm-ites?) for several generations and his own journalistic background comes out in the easy style of the text. Joseph Hache settled in the Houma area before 1803 (as confirmed by the U.S. government in 1823), and Terrebonne became one of the most heavily settled rural areas in the world, with farmers and timbermen (mostly northern slaveholders) in the north and trappers and fishermen in the south, who had arrived from the Gulf. Houma, built at the juncture of six waterways, was incorporated in 1834 and quickly became the parish seat. The arrival of the railroad in 1872 assured cheap shipping of sugar and seafood to outside markets, and the arrival of large numbers of Protestant oil field workers in the 1920s and `30s meant frequent intermarriages and a tradition of religious tolerance. Cobb begins his pictorial coverage with the town's centennial celebration in 1934, which included the dedication of a new City Hall. Subsequent chapters cover civic and social leaders, the ordinary people of the community and the surrounding villages, the big snowstorm of 1958, the destruction caused by Hurricane Carla in 1961, the visit of President Nixon during the campaign of 1972, the construction of Higgins PT boats during World War II, and even the introduction of a shrimp-drying process to Houma in 1873 by Lee Yuen of Canton, China. The books in this series are fascinating browsing, even if you don't come from the town depicted.	2005-06-20

Traditions included burial of a wife with her birth family, not her husband, and entombment of slaves with the family, and numerous ethnic and fraternal societies have sponsored tombs, especially in the three St. Louis cemeteries. There's a great deal of local history here, but this is primarily a picture book of high quality that includes twenty-eight cemeteries in Orleans Parish, the River Parishes, and neighboring communities like Chalmette and Lacombe. Featured tombs include those of Jefferson Davis, Benjamin Latrobe, Marie Laveau, John Kennedy Toole, Louis Prima, and many ordinary citizens and families. The photography is first-rate and the discussions of architectural styles, religious observances, and the jazz funeral will keep you engaged.	2005-06-20

Swanwick is a gifted, provocative writer (I loved _The Iron Dragon's Daughter_), but he can also be challenging and not terribly forgiving of the reader; you have to pay attention. Several times in the first third of this book, I nearly gave it up as a bad job. (Even terrific writers have bad days.) But I reconsidered and decided to be patient, and I'm glad I was. I'm a fan of time-travel plots, but the skeins of causality and chronology are incredibly tangled here. The subjects are paleontologists -- bone-hunters -- who have suddenly been invited by the Pentagon, in the year 2012, to join in an intensely secret project to study first-hand the dinosaurs, ranging over a period of several hundred million years, via the time travel technology to which they inexplicably have access. I thought, \\"What?\\" Does anyone believe the government, least of all the military, couldn't come up with more important (to them) uses for time travel than pure scientific research? (Patience; all will be revealed.) The author does a brilliant job of letting the major characters develop in wholly believable ways, of showing how a changing combination of personality and circumstances can produce highly varied results. Because everyone exists in several different \\"plies,\\" different timelines, depending on decisions made or not made. Richard Leyster, not always the most brilliant scientist but a very, very good paleontologist nevertheless, is the most sympathetic. Gertrude Salley, on the other hand, can be positively loathsome in her selfish arrogance and manipulative attitude toward the world -- but she has a purpose in the story, too, and she's not all bad. Griffin, the consummate bureaucrat, is the most complex and to some extent the least understandable -- but that's the kind of person he is. Apart from the fascinatingly complex human interactions which alone would make this a very readable book, Swanwick knows and communicates a great deal about the way science works and how scientists think, plus shrewd speculation about saurian behavior. The jargon and overuse of taxonomy is a bit overwhelming at first -- but this is also deliberate, to immerse the reader in the paleontologists' mental universe. And he also gets in his licks at the religious fanaticism of faith-oriented thinking, so alien to the scientific mind, by convincingly (and chillingly) describing the terrorist activities and mind-set of \\"deep creationists\\" -- anti-evolutionists so convinced of their sole access to Truth, they construct a jihad and throw bombs. (Yes, there really are people like that in contemporary American society, plenty of them.) What I first was afraid would represent a narrative failure turned out to be one of this author's most affecting books. Read it.k, plus shrewd speculation about saurian behavior.

It's less of a picture book, though, and more of a glove-compartment guidebook, with information on some 800 historical locations in England, Wales, and Scotland (including the Orkneys -- but no Ireland, for some reason), only a few of which were in the series. Photos are included for maybe twenty percent of the sites listed, and the short annotations often are only teasers; i.e., you have to go there and look for yourself.

She's been an award-winning novelist for two decades but I only just recently discovered her. This was her first novel, nominated for the National Book Award, and it's set during and just after Reagan's election in 1980 -- which seems like the Paleolithic now (Bush having brought us up to perhaps the Neolithic). Lexi Steiner is a New York girl transplanted to Southern California, an ambitious immigration lawyer whose best friend (alter ego, actually) is Nell, a writer. The two of them have followed each other around the country since college, being constantly together, sometimes sharing bedmates, and always telling each other absolutely everything. But at the age of twenty-nine, their shared life as \\"refugees\\" is beginning to wear thin; maybe love and caring about someone isn't such a bad idea after all. Then there's David Wiley, semi-fanatical hard-news reporter who's really tired of living in hotels and airports. Lexi and David get together for dinner at just the right moment in both their lives, and you sort of know where things are headed. But first they have to figure out how to be a couple, but it's like slow dancing: You just stand close together and move your feet a little. This is really a well-written story and even in her first novel, Benedict shows great expertise in character development. The unsettling thing is how different the times were in 1980, how \\"quaint\\" Lexi's and Nell's sexual adventures seem, how naive David's daughter, Louise, is at twelve and fourteen. It makes you realize just how far the country has backslid in the past decade; I expect high-top shoes and buggy-whips any day now. You forget what \\"liberal\\" used to mean, before the Right turned it into a swear-word. Terrific book, though.	2005-06-12

By and large, this is an excellent series for moving beyond the usual sort of travel book and getting a look at what makes a city or a country work elsewhere in the world. I spent some time in the UK about forty years ago, got thoroughly hooked on London, and have made several visits back there since, but I was never able to figure a way to move there permanently -- or I simply never quite worked up the nerve. Whatever. The Thatcher years changed the city enormously and mostly not for the best, and the Blair years (which this book doesn't cover, obviously) probably have changed things yet again. But the root condition of \\"London-ness\\" hasn't changed in centuries, and the author does a very good job of communicating what that is, from the day-to-day workings of the \\"nanny state\\" and the natural civility and courtesy of most Londoners (most of them, most of the time) to thumbnail descriptions of the Metropolitan Area's neighborhoods and why you *really* don't want to own a car there if you can help it. Hargraves is a Yank who spent seven years living and working as an almost-ordinary bloke in London, and his perspective, leavened by dry wit, make for very engaging reading.	2005-06-12

Caught in the middle are their mother, and the new baby, and the local biker scumbags in the small Cornish town to which they have moved from the train wreck of London. Jessie, who is carnality personified, insists there must be nothing she would not do, while Tom, who hates his sister and adores her in equal measure, isn't nearly the bad boy he wants to be -- or thinks he ought to be. Stuart's prose is intensely vivid and impossible to glide over, no matter how uncomfortable you become at some of the scenes he paints.

In that regard, this one is better than the last two, with a straightforward story of fraud and murder. At least, it starts out as a straightforward story, but there are plots within plots involving an autistic boy and an almost unbelievably bad-guy sheriff's deputy. And, of course, Janeway gets to throw his weight around and threaten people, which is becoming tiresome. (Dunning seems to think behavior that would be criminal in a cop is okay in a private citizen, especially when he is, by definition, wearing the white hat.) Dunning is going to have to come up with something different the next time around, some way in which his characters mature, or I'm likely to lose interest.	2005-06-12

I've been fascinated by it ever since, I read everything published about it, and about the Conquest, and this is one of the best studies I've ever seen. The author is an English attorney, not an academic historian, which means this is not a scholarly publication, but it's nevertheless a very well written, thoroughly judicious, extremely well-informed treatment of a well-trodden subject. He begins at the beginning, with the first scene depicted on the tapestry: King Edward on his throne, followed by Duke Harold (he was actually an earldorman, but this is a French work, after all) and the beginning of his visit to the Continent that would lead to the battle at Hastings. Bridgeford summarizes all the past interpretations of depicted events and weighs each in the light of later discoveries, notes the effect of 19th century repairs to the needlework which \\"rewrote\\" some of the tapestry's scenes, and discusses the accuracy (or not) of the later ballads and poems. He also makes an excellent case for the tapestry being in part a piece of pro-French (not pro-Norman) propaganda. Two extensive sets of color plates -- of the tapestry as a continuum and as a series of key scenes -- make the text very easy to follow. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the Conquest.	2005-05-27

Sanderlings with their toothpick legs, skittering over the shoreline like wind-up toys on speed.\\" Putting it simply, Benedict is a master of the language. The way she can nail a character, or describe a room, or evoke an emotion with a few very choice words tells you everything you would ever need to know about writing first-rate fiction. This one takes place all over a single very long weekend, beginning with 48-year-old Sophy Chase with her lover in New York when she receives the phone call from the police that her husband, from whom she has been separated for three months, has been found dead back on the island where they had become full-timers. Maybe he committed suicide. If so, maybe it's her fault. It's an apocalyptic catalyst for change in Sophy's relationships with her grown stepdaughters and her lover's Vietnamese adoptees, in the way she sees her own life, where she's been and where she's going. The plot-threads of her intermittant alcoholism, her longing for children of her own, her dependence on a gay male friend, her discovery that she's being upstaged by another friend on the island whose perfect life is facing a marital disaster of his own -- her neediness in general -- all these create a rich narrative fabric. It's often a funny story, but in the sense that the human condition is often funny, if you pay attention. And her characters absolutely ring true. I confess, it's hard for me to read a book like this one without trying to cast it as a film. But with the right screenplay, it would be a terrific flick.	2005-05-27

I think	This is the fifth novel in Baker's \\"Company\\" series about Dr. Zeus, Inc., which operates as a massive plutocratic conspiracy down through history. It's certainly the best since the first two, _The Garden of Iden_ and _Sky Coyote._ The frame story is about the immortal Mendoza's imprisonment on Santa Catalina in the Back Way Back of 150,000 years ago, and the sudden appearance of Alec Checkerfield, 7th Earl of Finsbury, in a stolen time shuttle. Of course, he's the image of Nicholas and Edward, her two lost loves of the first two books. So what's going on? Telling that takes up the rest of the book, and it's based on Baker's preparatory short story, \\"Smart Alec.\\" Actually, this book stops just before what I expected was going to be the big climatic scene, so I shall have to wait impatiently for the *next* (and probably last) volume. Alec is certainly a fascinating character, a manufactured hero who outsmarts his makers through the help of an AI he modifies by removing its moral restraints, and which eventually becomes an equally powerful opponent to Dr. Zeus. The \\"pretend Inklings\\" of the 24th century, who constitute a small circle of idea men for the conspiracy, are also much more convincingly portrayed than in the last couple of volumes, where they had an annoying comic book, straw-man quality.

It's also a marvelous homage to both Jerome K. Jerome and the English mystery novel. Got all that? Really, the plot is so convoluted and multi-layered -- even for a time travel novel -- that it defies short description. But Connie is a dab hand at managing such things, and you'll never lose track of what's going on. (Though you may be glad she also follows the convention of The Detective Explains All at the End.) Her dialogue is delightful and her droll descriptions of Victorian manners owe something to Oscar Wilde's playwriting, her characters are a hoot yet sympathetic, and she is (as always) a master of telling detail. The future is the same as in her earlier _Doomsday Book_ and _Fire Watch,_ but with less seriousness and a lot more fun. And now go back and read _Three Men in a Boat!_	2005-05-21

She did this very,very well in her first novel, _China Mountain Zhang,_ and she does it almost as well in this one, her second. She also doesn't make the mistake of stopping to explain when and where the story is set, explaining how history has created this particular future: She just does her narrative job and lets the reader figure it out, bit by bit. In this case, we're a couple of generations into the future, when an undersea colony built by the United States in the Caribbean has won its independence. But that was sixty years ago, and now Caribe is just another Third World Latin American dictatorship run by a president-for-life, with an upper class who are very rich and an underclass who are very poor. Jean-David Dai, a young French ex-soldier wounded in the South African wars, has come to try out for a security job looking after a bank officer named Mayla Ling, a naive member of the \\"haves\\" who has been targeted by a political underground. David's trying to escape his past and his nightmares, and he's not sure this job is the way to do it, but he agrees to give it a shot for six months. Then things get out of hand, naturally. Mayla's house is bombed, David disappears, the bank is sucked up by a neighboring conglomerate, and things become very uncomfortable. The setting is fascinating; think Colombia or Guatemala, but 250 meters under the seabed, with a police force that does things its own way and citizens who know better than to argue, where business is routinely done with bribes and kickbacks, where internal combustion buses operate in defiance of good sense -- this being a closed system where air has to be recycled and the lower levels of society never get enough oxygen. Mayla has never known anything different, and comparing her comfortable view of this world to David's reaction to the cold and the dark makes you really pay attention. A quiet, thoughtful, convincing novel.fortable view of this world to David's reaction to the cold and the dark makes you really pay attention. A quiet, thoughtful, convincing novel.	2005-05-15

With her partner, Ivy, a living vamp (not yet graduated to the fully dead state, that is), and Jenks, her attitude-laden pixie back-up, Rachel is trying to bring down Trent, one of the leaders in the local underworld -- but this installment in the series leads to the discovery that even in Rachel's world, things aren't as black-and-white as they might seem on the surface. The plot is very nicely developed and you'll care about the characters, even when they screw up. Rachel's encounter with master vampire Piscary, who's as bad as they come, is especially jolting. But, as with her first effort, Harrison is badly in need of a developmental editor to hold her hand. She frequently makes egregiously bad word choices that cause an attentive reader to wince, and there's no excuse for her frequent lapses in spelling and grammar. The next in the series is due out later in 2005 and I'll be watching for it.	2005-05-12

So this rather sloppy novel is a considerable disappointment. It's the story of one day in the life of London neurosurgeon, Henry Perowne, who has pretty much everything a man could want: A career he's very good at, a wife he loves, successful children (poet and blues guitarist, one each), a nice house, a very nice car, and every reason to be satisfied. The day in question is February 15, 2003, when several hundred thousand Brits took to the streets to protest Bush's impending invasion of Iraq -- which Perowne rather approves of, having heard about Saddam's atrocities from a patient's first-hand experience. But Iraq and 9/11 are only a distant backdrop and you begin to wonder where the novel's conflict will come from -- at which point Perowne has a minor auto accident with Baxter, a small-time hood. The description of the collision and the characterization of Baxter (whom Perowne diagnoses on the spot with Huntington's disease) are the best things in the book, actually. Everyone else is pure cardboard, including Perowne's father-in-law, a famous poet named Grammaticus (say what? as in \\"Saxo\\"?), and his daughter, Daisy, and his too-good-to-be-true wife, a corporate media lawyer. Also, how could a professional man, a product of the English university system, never even have heard of a major literary figure like Matthew Arnold? And the reappearance of Baxter at the evening's family reunion, which could (and should) have been an example of McEwan's skill with narrative tension, is instead an embarrassing exercise in bathos. Every writer, even one as good as McEwan, is entitled to an occasional stumble, and I await his next effort -- but it had better be better than this one.	2005-05-12

I first read this monster from the library the month it came out, decided (after I had recovered from the experience) that it was probably the best thing I'd read in the whole of the `90s, went out and bought a hardback for myself, and set it in a place of honor on my shelves. Nearly six years on, I find that aging has only improved it. I've been working my way slowly through his recent trilogy, but Cryptonomicon is still better. His characters exist in a t least five dimensions and will stick with you from a long, long time. There's Lawrence Waterhouse, math prodigy and buddy of Alan Turing, who becomes one of the key codebreakers of World War II. There's Marine raider Bobby Shaftoe, a survivor of everything the war can throw at him -- except heroism. There's Randy Waterhouse, Lawrence's equally nerdy grandson, master Unix hacker, and generally nice guy. There's America Shaftoe, partly-Filipino granddaughter of Bobby, master deep diver, and all-round tough cookie -- which doesn't keep Randy and Amy from falling in love. There's Avi, Randy's best friend and front-man in all their business ventures -- in this case, building the world's first politically independent data haven, much to the dismay of major governments. There's Lieut. Goto Dengo, engineer for the Nipponese army and builder of the primary hiding place of Japan's stolen billions in gold bullion. And, moving like mist between the two separate generations, there's the _eminence gris_ Enoch Root, Catholic priest, doctor, cryptographer, conspirator, and take-no-prisoners philosopher. Add to this list several dozen supporting players, all equally well realized, and the richness of the narrative texture is unbelievable. Besides the sheer enjoyment you get from Stephenson's Roman-candle style, his highly original metaphors and similes, and his ironic sense of humor, you're gonna learn a lot about cryptography (both the wartime vintage and the present-day digital variety), and about irregular warfare, and a score of other subjects. Yes, it's a huge book -- but it has to be. The heft also allows space for the author's sprawling digressions on topics as diverse as jungle survival, the similarities between computers and church organs, granny-grade furniture, U-boat life, several Holocausts, imprinting of sexual fetishes, Finnish psychology, the neuro-sociological origins of the ancient Greek pantheon, how to divide up an inheritance, the socioeconomic underpinnings of paper currency, and the proper way to eat Cap'n Crunch. It doesn't all advance the plot, but don't worry about it. Every single paragraph in this thing is worth reading, savoring, and storing away for later rethinking.

During the intervening years, the author must have discovered Richard Burton (\\"the explorer, not the actor\\") because his enthusiasm for the great man is obvious. Janeway, of course, becomes kind of an instant an expert on Burton while wondering what to spend his windfall on from the Grayson case in the last book, and his successful purchase of an important volume at auction gets him on NPR, which leads to a lot of correspondence from nutso types, which leads him to the accidental discovery of what Burton was doing in this country during the lost three months of 1860. Which leads him to involvement in a death, a murder, and a rather vividly violent run-in with a Baltimore hood. The description of Charleston is pretty good but I think Dunning may have made a structural error by including the first-person mini-memoir of Charlie Warren; it was rather jarring. Still, the plot is pretty good and it looks like maybe Janeway will actually get the girl this time.	2005-04-07

Perhaps it's because Dunning doesn't have to spent so much time establishing the back-story and the milieu, and instead jumps right into things. Janeway is approached by another Denver ex-cop -- one he had no use for on the force and even less now -- who wants him to take on a semi-bounty-hunter job, escorting a girl back from Seattle to Taos to face charges of burglary and possibly ADW. Ordinarily, he'd laugh at the notion, . . . but the case involves a mysterious fine press edition of Poe's The Raven produced twenty years before by Darryl Grayson, a genius designer and pressman, and there's a hint of an unknown second edition that draws Janeway in against his will. When he makes contact with the girl, and with her family -- all of whom were Grayson confidantes -- he knows he's not going to bust her. But then things turn ugly, the girl flees in terror, people die, and Janeway's cop talents are required to not only relocate the girl but to keep himself out of jail long enough to figure out what's really going on. The mystery is more finally tuned and even better paced than in the first book, and the characters are beautifully drawn. The atmosphere in the rainy northwest is nicely noir and Dunning again tells you a great deal about the worlds of rare books and fine printing. I can see this on the screen and I don't know why someone hasn't done a screenplay.	2005-04-03

Of course, I took anything relating to the family's history, including old correspondence, military and employment files, and about forty pounds of old photo albums and several shoeboxes of loose snapshots. I'm slowly, steadily working my way through them, scanning not only photographs but also documents and old letters into a digitized format, cleaning up some of the older items with Photoshop, writing up brief text files (to be attached to the image files) explaining those people, places, and circumstances I could identify (and also transcribing my mother's penciled notes from the backs of many of the photos), and collecting everything in some sort of order on CDs for later distribution to the rest of the family. (Christmas is always coming.) Now, I'm reasonably computer-savvy and I have professional training in archival conservation, so all this seemed pretty obvious to me, but that probably would not be the case for many non-techies.<br /><br />Rhonda McClure to the rescue, as she has often done before! She begins by explaining at length the opportunities digitization offers for preserving (which is increasingly simple with a home computer) and disseminating documents and photos (via CDs and the Web). Then she discusses the relevant technology, including what to look for in an inexpensive flat-bed scanner (under $100 these days) and a digital camera (under $200 now for a good one). The \\"Imaging Road Warrior\\" chapter is excellent; she recommends keeping a journal of research and sites visited in your word processor. (I never travel without my laptop, digital camera, and a small combination scanner-printer.) She also does a good job explaining the \\"why\\" of image-editing and enhancing vintage photographs without drifting too far into the \\"how\\" (which would take another book, and would be too software-specific anyway), and suggests isolating faces of individuals in group shots for attachment to database entries in your chosen genealogy software. (I confess that had never occurred to me.) Digitizing and preserving audio- and videotapes is something I know very little about, but she seems to cover all the bases there, too. Then comes sharing and publishing (in the broadest sense) what you've digitized - which is half the point of doing all this in the first place. Even knowing that the pace of change in technology will cause sizable parts of this well-written volume to become outdated in a couple of years, I strongly recommend it.hich would take another book, and would be too software-specific anyway), and suggests isolating faces of individuals in group shots for attachment to database entries in your chosen genealogy software.

Working the reference desk in the Genealogy Department of a large public library can be an eye-opening experience. You have to know (or be able to identify) the principal resources for family research that might be very different from your own personal research, often involving regions of the country and ethnic groups with which you have limited experience. You have to be able to instruct beginners in the most basic concepts, often many times each day. And, perhaps most important, you have to be willing to listen (politely) to rambling family stories from library patrons. Swan has been doing all that for forty years -- even longer than me -- and has managed to maintain his enthusiasm to a remarkable degree. He's written a half-dozen previous books on various aspects of library administration and management, but this is his first work that I have seen in genealogy, and it's a terrific book.<br /><br />Where many such guides merely supply lists of names and addresses, and pointers to web sites, Swan tries to show the professional librarian who is a novice to genealogy how to select the best information sources and what to do with the data you find. He provides excellent advice on building a genealogy book collection and developing a collection of subscription databases, developing genealogy instruction programs in the library, cooperating with local professional researchers, and staying current with the literature. He includes an assortment of forms and classroom handouts, as well as a state-by-state directory of highly selected web and computer resources of special interest to librarians - all of which are also on the enclosed CD. I will go so far as to say that this volume, while not cheap, should be required reading for any genealogy librarian, instructor, mentor, or consultant.	2005-03-27

We all have \\"brick walls\\" -- those situations in which the courthouse records have disappeared, or no census record can be found, or there are four people with the same common name in the same neighborhood at the same time, not to mention people whom we come to suspect must have landed by flying saucer. After failing to find an obvious solution, the inclination often is to throw up one's hands and shift attention to an easier branch of the family. Marsha Rising, however, a well-respected author and long-time speaker in the field of genealogical methodology and case-making, wants us to embrace the brick wall as a challenge to our skills in research and evidence analysis. Her sessions at national conferences are always very popular, and with good reason, so you might think there's good reason to pay attention to anything she thinks is worth saying on the subject -- and you would be right.<br /><br />She presents here a research model that will focus your work, from reminding us of the distinction between \\"search\\" and \\"research,\\" and identifying the problem blocking the way (which actually may not be what you assume it is), to reevaluating the data you already have (you may simply not have recognized the answer), to identifying the specific evidence you need to solve your problem. And she illustrates each step with cogent case studies. Then she delves into the most common types of brick wall and the best ways to deal with them: The lack of vital records in the period before mandatory civil registration, the best use of the census (especially before 1850), the need to analyze collateral family members and community networks (what's called \\"cluster genealogy\\"), finding a replacement for the infamous \\"burned courthouse,\\" and separating individuals of the same name. She wraps up with a discussion of ten mistakes to avoid and a restatement of the components of careful analysis of the evidence. Rising's style throughout is professional yet accessible (though, personally, I could do without this publisher's cutesy marginal icons . . .), and I would not hesitate to recommend this excellent book as a classroom text in the advanced course at Samford.ould do without this publisher's cutesy marginal icons . . .), and I would not hesitate to recommend this excellent book as a classroom text in the advanced course at Samford.	2005-03-27

One of the earliest settlers in the area was William W. Buchanan, a Tennesseean who moved to Texarkana in the 1870s and became a sawmill entrepreneur in the pine woods of the Ark-La-Tex region, including one built in 1896 at what was then known as Barefoot. Just before Christmas of that year, J. F. Giles, assistant manager of the sawmill, pulled the sign down, wrote \\"Springhill\\" on the other side, and nailed it back up. Apparently, no one protested the unilateral name change and the community was incorporated under that name as a town in 1902. (This book is the centennial history.) Springhill's entire history has centered on trees, felled logs, sawn planks, and the railroad that carried away the finished product, and it weathered two world wars and the Great Depression -- at least until early 1979, when the International Paper Company closed the last mill. Since then, the town has struggled, more or less successfully, to diversify its economy, bringing in a number of small industries and profiting modestly from the discovery of oil and gas in the area. The population remains stable at about 5,500 and seems unlikely to boom, . . . which is undoubtedly how most of the residents prefer it. Hunting, fishing, and camping compete with the high school basketball and football teams for the community's attention, church attendance is ubiquitous, and citizens tend to have strong opinions on such issues as liquor by-the-drink and video poker at the local truck stop. The author, a native of Springhill and a Baptist minister in Texas for most of his career, has produced a smooth, generally balanced narrative leavened with scores of black-and-white photos, and anyone with family connections in the area should seek out this book.	2005-03-27

In this world of our near future (2005, according to the flap copy, but I don't think he's that explicit in the text), almost everything has been privatized, the U.S. has devolved into independent region-nations, and wealth and power enforce the divisions in society. Berry Rydell, a young ex-cop from Knoxville, is working for a private \\"armed response\\" outfit in Los Angeles until he screws up and is sent off to San Francisco as a driver for a skiptracer. Mr. Yamazaki, a Japanese student of social psychology and anthropology, is fascinated by the squatter community that took over the Oakland Bay Bridge, which was abandoned after the big quake. One of the bridge's residents is Chevette Washington, a bike messenger in the city, who looks after one of the aging pioneers of the bridge community -- but she also screws up, lifting what she thinks is just an expensive pair of shades from an annoying guy at a party. The glasses embody a secret that would destroy a lot of careers and Rydell's employer wants them back. Chevette is a marvelous character, as is Yamazaki, who enables the reader to see things from a truly foreign perspective. Gibson, a master of metaphor,  never wastes a word.

Those for the city of Shreveport began in 1875, and the first volume in this series covered Parts A & B of the Shreveport death registers, up to 1902. This second volume takes the registers up to 1914, after which date the death certificates are available on microfilm at the Louisiana State Archives and are indexed in the Statewide Death Index. The Introduction explains in some detail the laws and constitutional provisions covering the recording of births and deaths, as well as the earlier Shreveport municipal ordinances on the subject. The body of the book gives -- in the order recorded -- the name and age of the deceased, the death date, the parents' names when they appear (usually for stillborns and infants), and the page and certificate number in the original registers. The every-name index necessarily comprises thirty-five percent of the volume. The editing and layout are (as always in le Comit&eacute;'s publications) clean, accurate, and workmanlike, making this an easy book to use -- and an obvious source to consult if you have relatives in the northwestern part of the state.	2005-03-27

I've been a heavy user of online resources for a decade and a half, but I still make personal visits, legal pad in hand, to rural courthouses and cemeteries. I also have reviewed (in several publications) a considerable number of \\"Internet genealogy\\" how-to books over the years and I have found that many actually use that phrase only as a marketing ploy, devoting most of their attention either to genealogical methods in general or to computers and the Internet in general, not to the use of the Internet in family research. On a purely quantitative basis -- counting the pages, that is -- this volume gives about 25% of its space to traditional genealogical subjects (family group sheets, visiting a library, the nature of \\"courthouse records,\\" analysis of evidence, publishing a family newsletter, etc.), and about 30% to discussions of computer issues and the Internet (how Google works, why you should make backups of your data, getting an email account, finding an ISP that will include free web page space, and so on).<br /><br />This leaves only about 45% of the book to actually cover the use of computers and the Internet in pursuing genealogical research. As with most of its predecessors reviewed in this column, what the author has to say is actually worth reading and her advice, whether on research methodology or on making your way in cyberspace, is generally sound. But what the title refers to comprises less than half the book. It may also be worth noting that the author's principal qualification for writing seems to be that she is a frequent author for the print edition of FAMILY TREE MAGAZINE and a regular columnist for the magazine's online newsletter, and that that publication now owns Betterway Books.and that that publication now owns Betterway Books.	2005-03-27

Chia McKenzie, fourteen-year-old Seattle fan of the rock group Lo/Rez, has heard a rumor that lead singer/philosopher Rez plans to marry the idoru and her online buddies arrange to send her to Tokyo on a rescue mission. The other branch of the converging plot features Colin Laney, whose talent is perceiving and interpreting the patterns people create in the datastream, and who is hired by Rez's security chief to investigate the same rumor. This not-quite-sequel is set in the same future as _Virtual Light,_ with Yamazaki as a major supporting character and Rydel in the background, but the focus is on Laney's attempts to deal with an extremely strange world and on Chia's coping with the real Japan and the virtual Walled City. Again, Chia is a marvelous and perfectly believable character. It might be surprising that someone as technophilic as Gibson is so successful in painting portraits of adolescent girls, but I suspect he's incapable of hitting a wrong note. He just keeps getting better and better.	2005-03-27

Even though I do not, to my knowledge, have a single drop of royal blood in my veins, I have a longstanding interest in peerage genealogy -- if only because the earliest surviving records concern the lineages of European society's movers and shakers, not the yeoman farmers and small tradesmen whose genes I carry. Richardson is well known and widely respected in this field, having published numerous peerage articles in the most respected journals and having been a contributor to the last couple of editions of Weis. Those of us who hang out on the soc.genealogy.medieval newsgroup have watched for years as this massive work took shape (always keeping in mind that the level of discourse in that venue often verges on the sophomoric). The final result is close to being a masterpiece not only of genealogy of the traditional sort but of comparative historiography. His purpose is to document the lines of descent for about 190 individuals who immigrated to the North American colonies before 1700 from the Plantagenet dynasty who ruled England from 1154 (the accession of Henry II, Duke of Anjou) to 1485 (the defeat and death of Richard III at Bosworth Field at the hands of Henry Tudor). He notes that his work is an expansion and major revision of David Faris's _Plantagenet Ancestry of Seventeenth-Century Colonists,_ but the new work is so very extensive, this must really be regarded as an entirely new work; Faris considered only the descendants of Henry III (who died in 1272), where Richardson traces the progeny of all sixteen of Geoffrey's great-grandchildren who left descendants, both legitimate and illegitimate.

In fact, it's much more gritty and topical than even most adult thrillers I've read. The Secret Intelligence Service, based in London, is (apparently) an MI-6 kind of operation, chartered to carry out assassinations and other operations abroad but whose agents are not even allowed to be armed at home. Tara Chace -- \\"Minder Two\\" -- is their best shooter and the story opens with her involved in an unauthorized Special Operation in Kosovo to take out a rogue Russian officer now running with the Russian mafia. Her success, followed by an iffy escape from the scene, leads the Russians to put a bounty on her head -- and to fire a shoulder-launched rocket at the SIS headquarters, just to show they can. Paul Crocker, Director of Ops, wants not just to catch the perpetrators of the attack, he wants them dead. The Kosovo operation was a favor owed to the CIA, who now decline to help in his vendetta. And so on, in a nicely complicated plot that revolves on personalities and the rules of the game in a changed world as much as on action sequences. The art is straight black-and-white line drawing that emphasizes facial expression and body language -- which fits well with the rather talky style of the narration. My only complaint is that the story doesn't so much end as simply stop -- obviously only the first episode in a continuing series (which I haven't seen any sign of).	2005-03-25

Then I learned better and became a semi-fan, enough to rent several of the best-reviewed series from Blockbuster. But I had never sat down to learn the milieu of the art form until I came across this author's two books on the subject. He covers a very wide range of Japanese cultural \\"stuff,\\" from names of historical periods and the different types of bells you find in temples, to major writers whose work has been adapted in anime and the reason for the big-eye-pink-hair thing. You'll no longer wonder why guys in Japan get nosebleeds from looking at girls, what the sound of cicadas in the background are intended to imply, and why you shouldn't be upset that some anime meant for kids includes mild nudity. For that matter, he goes into the sexual psychology of various other Japanese folkways, too, with no embarrassment or leering, which supplies the cultural context you really need if you're going to understand this stuff. Actually, this book would be useful not only to would-be otaku but to any westerner puzzled by various aspects of Japanese society. There's a new, thicker edition coming out soon and I'm definitely going to have to acquire it.	2005-03-25

I wondered what the \\"1/2\\" business was all about -- and now, having finally read this first volume (out of more than two dozen), I know! Akane Tendo is the youngest of three daughters of the proprietor of a martial arts school in Tokyo. Her father's old friend, Mr. Saotome, is returning from a visit to China, accompanied by his very eligible son, Ranma; both of them are, of course, masters of an assortment of martial arts of the most dramatic kind. The two fathers have already arranged that Ranma will marry one of Tendo's daughters and assure the continuation of the Tendo school. But the Saotomes have this problem: Having fallen into a cursed Chinese spring in the midst of a sparring session, Ranma now turns into a girl (cute, too) when splashed with cold water and switches back to a boy when doused with hot water. (His father switches from irascible middle-aged man to irascible middle-aged panda.) This leads to a very strange relationship with Akane, who hates boys (she says). The byplay between the two is a gender-bending hoot, and so is the self-centered upperclassman Akame has to fight every morning before he switches his attention to Ranma (and I know he has his own curse to deal with later in the series). There's also the revenge-seeking fighter from Ranma's old school who has no sense of direction whatever. I especially like the way they've translated the \\"sound words\\" into English as well as the dialogue. This is first-rate comic manga and I can see I'm going to have to hunt up the rest of the series.	2005-03-25

It turns out to be a rather pedestrian, very derivative, anoyingly unimaginative superhero tale in the \\"Twilight Zone\\" mold, in which Fort (an employee of the New York Public Library) welcomes a visitor from space who is on the trail of an escaped monster-virus killing off New York's business elite (why just them?). Gov. Theodore Roosevelt has a supporting role, as does a young H. P. Lovecraft (who did *not* live in New York as a child), plus a couple of others who are never explained.

Because, even though Emily Toth gives special attention to the problems of women in combating the many variant forms of sexism (from mere idiocy to outright harassment), much of what she has to say regarding survival is just as valuable to the guys. Following the third-person style of Miss Manners in a column she originally began writing for the MLA periodical Concerns, she starts with advice for graduate students preparing for the job interview, goes on to the first year as a newly-hired Ph.D., the \\"perils and pleasures\\" of actually teaching, the pursuit of tenure (practicality reigns here, as distasteful as that might be in the ivory tower), what to do once you've achieved it, and so on -- right up to the emeritus years. She begins each discussion with actual letters from readers but often goes far afield in prescribing advice. The mordant humor and twinkling cynicism make the medicine go down a treat.	2005-03-25

The setting is the city of Partington in the world of Arcadia, which strongly resembles late-Victorian London -- with the addition of live gargoyles and a touch of the supernatural. The story revolves around Simon Archard, a not very personable Holmesian sort of detective who seldom finds a challenge in the crimes and puzzles he investigates. His assistant (or junior partner, depending on who you ask) is Emma Bishop -- who is not the retiring Doctor Watson sort and is nearly as quick-witted as Simon, and who has (unbeknownst to him) the ability to freeze time. Emma don't get no respect, though. And there seems to be some kind of cosmic game or field study, or something, going on with her but, unfortunately, it's never explained. Not in this volume, anyway. Into the picture comes the mysterious and dangerous foreign baroness, Melinda Cross, with plans to control (through drugs) the city's social and political elite, and Simon and Emma have to find out what's going on and how to stop it. The fifth chapter has Simon mostly off somewhere on his own (at Reichenbach Falls, maybe?), leaving Emma to solve a streetwalker-murder case. And the sixth and last chapter goes off in an entirely different direction, bringing in Simon's earlier partner, presumed dead, but actually just pathological. The book ends there, just as the new story arc is getting started, which is annoying (they should have restricted this volume to only the first five issues), but the byplay between Simon and Emma is enjoyable, the plotting is over the top in true Victorian fashion, and the realistic art style is terrific.	2005-03-25

All the threads of the first two novels about Terry Orr come together here in a (more or less) satisfying resolution, which means you definitely do *not* want to read this book first. It's really almost a single long novel, and you'll have to start at the beginning. It all starts with the death (natural) of one of the major supporting characters, with the informal will the deceased leaves behind, and the back story of his exile in New York from south Louisiana. Terry has to see to it that his late friend's wishes (on behalf of another close friend) are fulfilled, which involves a couple of trips to New Orleans. Now, Fusilli's work is noteworthy for the sense of place he gives to New York City -- a place I have never lived -- but I have to say he also does pretty well by New Orleans and Thibodaux -- a part of the world I know very well. The details and place names he drops are accurate and well directed. (Though I also have to say he perhaps makes more of the local humidity than necessary. On the other hand, I'm originally from south Texas, which may be even soggier than the bayous. . . .) But the real plot interest for fans of the series is Terry's discovery that everything he thought he knew about his late wife, about the nature of his marriage, and about the schizophrenic whom he believes killed his wife and son -- all of it is fundamentally incorrect. And other people who sympathize with him knew it all along. Five years of his life wasted. Five years when he should have concentrated much more on his adolescent daughter. The resolution of his conflict with The Madman is cinematic in its \\"rightness,\\" and it wraps up the trilogy rather nicely. But, perhaps unfortunately, there's now a fourth novel out about Terry Orr; having resolved the tensions in Terry Orr's life, what is the author going to do with him now? I'll keep my fingers crossed.	2005-03-14

Being interested in Japanese culture and literature generally, I had some understanding of why anime is the way it is, and why it's so much different from American or European graphic art, but reading this well-written book, I found there was a great deal I had missed. Poitras writes from the fan's point of view, so he knows what questions he should be addressing -- everything from the \\"big eye\\" mania, to the difference between hentai and mainstream manga, to the nervousness among the U.S. morals police about \\"foreign\\" art, to actually setting up and publicizing a fan group, plus the ins and outs of model kits, imported publications, and so on.

Terry Orr, historian turned private detective, lost his wife and infant son four years ago when a madman (whom he thinks of as The Madman) pushed them in front of a subway train. Now he obsesses on revenge, to the detriment of his career, his friends, and (sometimes) his precocious daughter, Bella. The plot this time revolves around a thirty-year-old mugging that became a murder, and the death of the newly-released woman who went to prison for it. Everybody in the case has secrets, not least of all the Mango brothers, who are a good deal more scary than in Fusilli's first book. Terry works things out in a wholly believable manner, partly by research, partly by instinct. The subplot, about Terry's buddy, rock critic Dennis Diddio, and his hopes for an industry award, is funny and compassionate. So is his struggle to deal with the attentions of Julie, a very nice ADA who believes in him. But arching over everything else is New York City in the aftermath of September 11th, when Terry's personal loss is overshadowed. Fusilli's work has great specificity of place -- you could walk through the city, book in hand, and see every detail he talks about -- and that's what makes this a standout piece of writing.	2005-03-13

Its inhabitants *know* it is, but they also know how to deal with it. Sometimes. In the case of Terry Orr, respected writer of popular history and husband of a highly-regarded Italian artist, the death two years ago of his wife and infant son on a subway platform at the hands of a crazed derelict has changed his entire world, even in ways he hasn't yet realized. Now, having given up writing for a PI's license, he tries to learn how to find and (perhaps) take revenge on the killer. Rather than explaining all of that, though, this first in the series begins \\"in media res\\", revealing the back-story bit by bit, through Terry's letters to his late wife, through his largely hostile sessions with a psychiatrist, and through the words and actions of his circle of supportive friends. The two cases he undertakes here involve the murder of a black hack driver whose body he discovers while jogging, and the bombing of the art gallery owned by his wife's agent. The two plots are uncomplicated but realistic, the sort of thing that happens all the time in the Big City, but the real story centers on Terry's inner turmoil and on his relationship with his very bright twelve-year-old daughter, Bella. Fusilli is a music critic (like Terry's close friend, Diddio the pothead), but this is his first novel. He shows great talent in delineating his vividly three-dimensional characters: Automatic Slim, the ex-con basketball artist; Montana, a street kid on the way even farther down; Sol Beck, derivative artist with nowhere to go; Jimmy Mango, general hustler, and his brother, Tommy the Cop; Luther Addison, homicide lieutenant with thinly-stretched tolerance; and perhaps the most important character of all -- New York City.	2005-03-06

She was something of a groundbreaker in the 1970s, but by the late `80s, when this one came out, teenage culture had changed radically. (Now, with the country sliding back into intellectually repressed puritanism, maybe she'll become a retro-groundbreaker.) Anyway, Paul Gold is a senior in an arts TAG high school in New York. He's a talented writer who dreams of someday seeing his plays produced on Broadway, but he's also in most ways your basic eighteen-year-old. A one-nighter with Sonya, his best female friend, which they both sort of fell into unplanned, and her recriminatory attitude afterward, lead him to write a play about the incident for production at school. (It's all grist, folks.) But then Sonya gets together with Wolf, Paul's best male friend, and the balancing act becomes painful. But that's only part of it! When Paul takes a job walking the small, ancient, ugly dog belonging to married, twenty-two-year-old Zoe, a warm, conflicted, sweet young woman you can't help but have warm feelings toward. They begin an affair that they know can't last, and it doesn't. But what could have been merely a late-adolescent fantasy in other hands, becomes a charming, bittersweet love story under Klein's guidance. She knows how complicated life really is. Nice ending, too.	2005-03-03

All the stories are themselves about storytelling, the first being the not entirely trustworthy account by Merv Pumkinhead (Dreamland's janitor) of his exploits in recovering stolen dream-dust and (of course) saving the world in the process. He's a James Bond clone in his own mind, with a bit of Agent 86 thrown in. The second piece, which should appeal to my fellow librarians everywhere, is \\"The Further Adventures of Danny Nod, Heroic Library Assistant,\\" about the perils of recovering checked-out library books. It's kinda weak, though. The last piece is a catch-all sort of visual narrative FAQ about why dreams work the way they do. But in between is the meat of the book, a four-part yarn centering on the last of the Thessaliad witches, her quest to do unto the ancient death gods of various cultures before they do unto her, and her possible involvement with a nice-looking but ghostly fetch (called Fetch, naturally). On the surface, Thess is a cute, bespectacled college student in pink bunny-slippers and a teddy bear backpack, but underneath she's a cold-blooded survivor who's not afraid of anything. People tend to die around her, innocent civilians included, but that's not (usually) her fault or her problem. Willingham writes a good story and Shawn McManus is a terrific artist of the realist persuasion, just right for this sort of story.	2005-03-01

This graphic novel is a first-rate combination of thoughtful, even profound storytelling, detailed setting (back story courtesy of Lawrence Watt-Evans), and artwork that absolutely glows.

Picture an alternate version of the world, very much like our own -- except that bioengineering took the place of space flight as a matter of international political competition, and that a certain bug got loose from the labs in the form of a genetically modified tomato and killed off a substantial fraction of the human race. Only the witches, vampires, were-creatures, pixies, fairies, and other non-human among us (they've always been there) weren't affected at all, and now they make up half the population, more or less. Rachel Morgan, a Cincinnati cop (and earth witch) for the nonhuman part of the government, is on her agency's blacklist (we're never really told why) so she quits to set up her own detective (\\"runner\\") agency. Her boss is glad to see her go -- but his top runner, Ivy Tamwood, a very high-caste vamp, leaves to join Rachel, who thereupon finds a price on her head. You don't quit the agency if they don't want you to. To buy her freedom from assassination, Rachel decides to get the goods on Councilman Trent Kalamack, a suspected drug lord. But Trent, to whose handsomeness she is reluctantly drawn, is much more than that. And that's the plot, such as it is. Actually, I found the action here less interesting than the setting and the characters; Ivy's struggle to be a \\"good\\" vampire is fascinating, and Jenks, Rachel's pixie backup, is a lot of fun. The problem is, the first two-thirds of the book depicts Rachel, who has something of Stephanie Plum about her, being constantly frightened of absolutely everything and everyone (especially Ivy) while still insisting that she's a talented and skilled runner. I don't find this entirely believable. When she gets trapped in the form of a mink, the story becomes much more involving, and her fight with the demon is very well done. On the other hand, the author's sometimes jarring and even incorrect word-choices would have benefitted from the attention of a good copyeditor.

Kildare is the center of things in her New York townhouse, throwing dinner parties and trying not to think about her once-lover, Thomas, the mortal knight to whom she behaved so badly. Then a huge black knight comes looking for Puck and the story gets complicated. Of the characters, I especially like the artist whose portraits are so real, they even capture the subject's soul. Holguin's story is terrific, but the art, while generally quite good, is sometimes less than adequate in depicting facial expressions, especially those under stress.	2005-03-01

A few years ago, Chabon wrote a well-received novel, _The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,_ about two comic book impresarios in the 1930s, `40s, and `50s. Their greatest creation was the Escapist. It's only fitting that the fictional character of a fictional author in a fictional comic book come to life in a real book. A dozen or so writers and artists come together to present a series of stories from the Escapist's career, rendered in the styles of four or five decades, and Chabon and Malachi Cohen surround them with relevant history and literary/artistic criticism. One of the main supporting characters, Luna Moth, also gets a couple of stories. The best thing in this volume, though, is \\"The Lady or the Tiger,\\" supposedly published in 1976 -- and which Glen Gold's introduction makes clear was the literary peak of the (fictional) series. Finally, the classic comic book \\"advertising\\" on the back cover is a hoot, especially the bit on bar codes!	2005-03-01

(She was also nominated for the Edgar in 2004.) What amazes me is that none of the reviews I've read mentioned the book's thoroughly Hitchcockian atmosphere and plot development. You can see things coming that make you wince in anticipation. And you sometimes want to yell at the characters -- especially the selfish, self-centered Kuniko -- \\"Don't be stupid! Don't do it!\\" (Can't wait for the movie!) Kirino, who used to work as a club hostess herself, reveals a desperate, gritty world of female night-shift workers and gambling clubs and small-time hoods, none of which are the slightest bit romanticized. Families won't speak to each other, husbands drink to submerge their depression, women drown in their own desperation. And Yayoi, a young, beautiful wife and mother, passes the last point of patience and strangles her womanizing husband who has thrown away their life savings. She turns for help to Masako, strongest of four friends on the night shift at a boxed lunch factory, and after that there's no turning back for any of them. These are not the quiet, giggling childlike women that writers like Kawabata and Mishima insist are unique to Japan; they're real people not subject to traditional sentimental male values and prejudices, and they have far more in common with ordinary women in other cultures than Westerners would have thought. And Kirino's willingness to say so has had a groundbreaking effect on Japanese literature generally. But this is not to slight her other characters, especially Jumonji, the on-the-make loan shark who wants to recruit Masako as a business partner, and Satake, the disturbingly bent ex-con who has killed for love -- sort of. In fact, the only thing wrong with this book is the rather flat, uninspired translation, but even that won't keep this story from gripping you by the throat.	2005-02-24

It's an article of faith and they can be quite sneering about it. So I admit I opened this volume with some trepidation. However, Williams, Peabody Professor of American Archaeology at Harvard, does a pretty good job -- though he's still quite conservative. He manages to question the truly questionable without casting personal aspersions or heaping ridicule. There have been out-and-out frauds for gain, like the Cardiff Giant, and frauds for fun, like the Davenport Tablets and (probably) the Spirit Pond Rune Stone, and notions now considered laughable, like the Land of Mu. But there are also issues like the Mormon conception of the origins of the American Indians that really *are* articles of faith, And there are topics of extended scholarly contention, like the Kensington Rune Stone and the Vinland Map, in which each argument advanced by one side may be countered by a balancing argument from the other side. (Williams denounces the Kensington Stone as the product of Scandinavian ethnic pride in response to the Columbian Quadricentennial celebration in nearby Chicago. He assumes the Yale map is a fake because of the tests carried out in the late 1980s but much more advanced and subtle tests performed in recent years have put the map question back on the table.) Taken as a whole, the author does a pretty fair and balanced job and his style is certainly very readable.	2005-02-24

Elfland has reappeared in our world from its parallel dimension to the general detriment of human society. Danny, nineteen years old, a trained EMT, and too bitter for his age, journeys from Iowa to the nearest  point of contact with the Shade, in Chicago, where he becomes part of the entourage of Mr. Patrise, a partly bent, partly noble power in this new world. There he becomes Doc Hallow, repairing wounds caused by gunshot and other, less Worldly forces in the struggle between Truebloods and humans. And that's about all the real plot there is. The real point in reading this darkly magical book is to experience the characters who inhabit it, to enjoy the interplay among them, to observe what magic does to people and non-people alike. Doc has his own deep secrets that keep him from loving, but he also has a strain of glowing personality that leads people to defer to him unexpectedly. Ford is an artist with fairy dust on his brush.	2005-02-24

This novel is something of a departure for Lethem, all of whose previous work has been experimental and occasionally bizarre in structure, theme, and characterization. It's nearly a traditional straight narrative -- and a good one, too. Four somewhat inept orphans from St. Vincent's Home for Boys in Brooklyn -- the \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" of the title -- are taken under the wing of Frank Minna, local fixer and small-time hood, who becomes the center of their universe. And fifteen years later, the \\"Minna Men\\" are still in thrall, carrying out shady errands under cover of being operatives of a detective agency. One of the four is Lionel Esrog, the narrator, who suffers from Tourette's Syndrome. His uncontrollable outbursts and tics are tolerated by his peers and by his acquaintances in the neighborhood from long habit, but everyone seems to equate his behaviors with a lack of intelligence. Lionel, mostly self-educated and far from stupid, is in fact a very perceptive and self-aware person. Then Frank is murdered almost under Lionel's nose and he must try to find the killer and exact vengeance while struggling to control his Tourette's. His quest through the web of unexpected relationships and parts of Brooklyn he never knew make for a riveting story. But the real star here is Lionel's own interior self, his painfully developed coping skills, his constant self-observation. Lethem is always masterful in his use of the English language but he excels in letting Lionel's syndrome reveal his thoughts. This is a highly original author's most mature work to date.	2005-02-14

Of the fifteen or so books I've read in the Discworld series, this is the most esoteric and metaphysical -- and, perhaps for that reason, it tends to drag in the middle, when Pratchett is having to come up with explanations and the main characters are mostly on the road. The plot revolves around the Monks of Time, ensconced in a monastery way up in the high mountains near the Hub. Their job is to see that things happen. Not merely the \\"right things\\" -- just things. They've learned how to move time from slack periods in history to those points where it's really needed. And perhaps the most important person in the monastery is not the 800-year-old abbot (presently enduring an infantile reincarnation) but the 700-year-old lowly sweeper, Lu-Tze, who takes under his wing a novice named Lobsang, an orphaned ex-thief from Ankh-Morpork, who turns out (of course) to be very important to the survival of Time itself. Because there's a young clockmaker in the city who is about to construct a crystal clock with the ability to stop the progress of time. All this happens because the non-human Auditors want everything nice and tidy. My favorite character this time, though, is Miss Susan, whom we've met before. She's DEATH's granddaughter and she shares a certain number of his abilities (even though she's adopted, but genetics works in more ways than one), which she uses mostly in her job as a grade-school teacher. This is not one of Pratchett's best efforts, especially for his later work, but it's still far, far from being a waste of time.	2005-02-14

McFarland is a professor of American history at UMass with several volumes on 19th century political history to his credit, but here he turns his attention to a subject much closer to home: The migration of his mother's family from the east coast just after 1800 to the west coast c.1900. The various lines began in western Connecticut and in Rensselaer, New York, and in western Virginia and North Carolina, and they followed the paths trod by many thousands of frontier families (including most of my own lines), along the lower margin of the Great Lakes and down the Ohio River and across the Midwest. One branch of the family finally moved in the 1870s and `80s through Iowa, Nebraska, and Colorado into northern California and then to Oregon, while another headed down through Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Arizona into southern California. From the Atlantic to the Pacific in a century -- that is, in large part, the American story. The author is fortunate in that his ancestors were avid correspondents (and, later, photographers) so he is able to combine primary family source material with the contextual secondary sources available to all historical researchers. He also takes the opportunity to weave into this family narrative what he knows about contemporary events in the wider world, so this book is considerably more than \\"merely\\" genealogy. He also possesses a smooth and felicitous writing style and I do not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone interested in grass-roots American history or in a broader approach to family history.	2005-02-02

As always in his later novels about Disworld, Pratchett mixes wit and word-play with often very pointed commentary on some aspect of our own world. This time, he takes on the Fourth Estate in the person of young William de Worde, idealistic younger son of Lord De Worde, a very unpleasant and rather fascist leader of a cabal attempting to overthrow Lord Vetinari, the Patrician who runs Ankh-Morpork with an astute and even hand. William, who has been sending out occasional newsletters to foreign decision-makers of local events of interest, manages to invent not only the newspaper but journalism itself, discovering along the way that what people need to know generally isn't what they want to know and that tabloidism outsells News any day. Pratchett is more sympathetic to newspaper people than to those who read their work. Of course, William uncovers the facts about the plot -- gets personally caught up in it, in fact -- and must decide just how much of his father's son he really is. And Commander Vimes of the Watch (one of my two favorite recurring characters, the other being Lord Vetinari) must deal with the discovery that freedom of the press impinges on his own occasional urges. The practical Mr. Goodmountain, dwarf typesetter and owner of the actual press, is a nice balance to William's zeal, as is Sacharissa, natural newswriter. And Otto, the vampire iconographer. Most unsettling, perhaps, are Mr. Tulip and Mr. Pin, the former a combination of enraged thug and art connoisseur, the latter a cold-blooded \\"arranger\\" for hire. I hope Pratchett lives another few decades and keeps this stuff coming.	2005-02-02

He's not bent -- not on the take, anyway -- but he's crossed the line many times in his career, and not always in the pursuit of subjective justice. He's been sent back to the police academy for professional rehabilitation after a tea-mug throwing incident, and is put in with a small group of other questionable coppers trying to keep their jobs by undergoing \\"resurrection.\\" Only (of course) there's a lot more to it than that. When the \\"Wild Bunch\\" are given an old murder case to investigate as a team-building exercise, it's one Rebus was involved with in a way he'd rather no one else knew about. But he's really there as a mole at the behest of the higher-ups, who suspect some of his colleagues of involvement in another drug-murder case. And Siobhan Clarke, newly promoted to Detective Sergeant and Rebus's sort-of protege, has her own case to manage. Then all three murders begin to come together. This one was recommended to me as one of the best in the series of more than a dozen, and while Rankin does a good job of filling in some of the many characters' shared background for the reader's benefit, it's obvious one needs to go back to the beginning and read them all in order to really get Rebus's measure. The style is as gritty as the back side of Edinburgh itself, the characters are believable as real people -- not a stereotype among them -- and the plot itself is well drawn, with nothing given away and no trick ending, but with lots of well-crafted suspense. An excellent read.	2005-01-26

I suspect, from the reviews I've seen, that New Yorker cartoons are an acquired taste, like British TV comedy. Some people get it, some don't. When I first started working in public libraries, back in the late `60s, and I was covering the Reference Desk at night, I used to go down to the periodical stacks in the basement and pull an old bound volume of NEW YORKER, just so I could browse through the cartoons. (I used to haul out old volumes of the late lamented SATURDAY REVIEW, too, for the Double Crostics.) That's where I first came upon Sam Gross's oddball mind, and George Booth, who practically invented the curmudgeon, and Charles Saxon's highly original take on almost everything, and the consumate artist Saul Steinberg, and all the others. They were seldom \\"hah-hah\\" funny but I always sat there grinning my head off at the drolleries and the artists' highly original views of life. Some cartoons are pretty Gotham-centric, but not really that many -- not if you pay attention to anything outside your own little corner of the universe. This being a literary magazine, the humor is more often written than visual -- this ain't BEETLE BAILEY -- but there are plenty of examples of pure comic art with no text at all. This massive volume, which takes two hands to lug around, was my Christmas present to myself, and after a fast cruise from cover to cover (which still took three days), I've settled in to an extended perusal. Maybe I'll even build this monster its own mahogany reading stand. Two CDs are included, with all the cartoons in PDF files, searchable by artist and subject. There's a certain amount of variability in the quality of reproduction (in the book itself occasionally, too), but that's a very minor complaint.	2005-01-21

Regular readers of Pratchett's droll accounts of life on Discworld will be unsurprised to discover that there is, in fact, no literal elephant in this book at all. There are, as we all know, four very large elephants supporting the flat circularity of the world, who themselves stand on the back of an even more immense turtle swimming through space. The extra pachyderm referred to in the title is metaphorical, being the supposed origin of the huge, economically important, fat deposits that lie beneath Uberwald, providing employment for the mining skills of that country's dwarfs (though dwarfs have trouble with metaphors) -- who share the land (very carefully) with aristocratic vampires and werewolves. Lord Vetinari, Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, cognizant of his city's ever-growing need for high-quality lard and candles, sends as his ambassador to the coronation of the new Low King of Uberwald none other than His Grace Sir Samuel Vimes, Commander of the Watch. Sam, a copper's copper, naturally becomes involved in an attempted assassination of the not-yet-installed new king, which ties in with the murder of a rubber condom entrepreneur back in the city. Captain Carrot, Vimes's second-in-command, goes off in pursuit of his lady love (also a werewolf), leaving the Watch in the gloriously incompetent hands of Sgt. Colon and Corp. Nobbs. All of this gives Pratchett the perfect stage to air his opinions on the peerage, social conservatism, fascism, perceptions of race, the difference between officers and noncoms, and perhaps what it really means to be human. As the series goes one, Pratchett just gets better and better.	2005-01-17

But up until the First World War, it was common for even modestly middle class families to have at least a full-time \\"maid of all work\\" -- a job that could use you up in a short time but which was frequently the lot of girls under the age of twenty. The \\"servant problem,\\" as Sutherland convincingly shows, was a constant subject of conversation and correspondence in all regions of the country and in every decade of the 19th century, although most complainants seemed to think things were better elsewhere or at an earlier time in our history. A great many servants came from among the crowds of newly arrived immigrants, who were considered inferior by Anglo Americans in any case, and who bolstered the need of the theoretically democratic to be superior to someone. And while having servants was partly a matter of status, it was mostly a practical necessity: No housewife, especially with children, had the time nor the strength to singlehandedly cook, clean house, raise kids, and deal with merchants. The arrival of vacuum cleaners and other labor-saving inventions in the early 20th century took the pressure off, and the competitive rise in industrial wages meant additional economic options for the laboring classes. This is a fascinating, well-written, thoroughly documented study, especially for a converted doctoral thesis. It should be of interest to any student of American social history.	2005-01-17

The subtitle of this highly readable book is a bit purple -- \\"How an Untamed Wilderness Shaped the United States and Fulfilled the Promise of Democracy\\" -- but what the author has to say makes a good case. It's also an amazingly action-packed adventure story. Any genealogist learns early the practical ins and outs of frontier settlement and the titles, grants, and other documents that land claims inevitably produce. In this country, there are two distinct methods of recording those claims: \\"metes and bounds\\" in the original colonies and some of their western lands (such as Kentucky) and in Texas, which describe the boundaries of one's land in terms of the points at which it adjoins or \\"meets\\" a neighbor's land, and the rectangular survey system developed for use in the public land states created from the nation's later territorial acquisitions. The latter is far more rational and allows a claim to be filed based on geographical location without having actually set foot on the land -- but it also requires preliminary measurement by a party of government surveyors. Linklater lays out in much detail, and with colorful anecdotes, how the first surveys were decided upon and carried out (more or less) in the Northwest Territory, and later in the Plains states and the West. He describes how, thanks to the efforts of Thomas Jefferson, the U.S. nearly adopted a rational metric system early in its history (which in France and Prussia was an instrument of centralized government policy), and how that goal was waylaid by clinging to Edmund Gunter's English chain/furlong system, which had the virtue of being easily understood by semi-literate surveyors with minimal mathematical skills. He relates the part played by rapacious land speculators (most of them members of the old aristocracy of New York, Massachusetts, and the Carolina low country), by frontier town-builders enamored of rectangular blocks (and why Manhattan has narrow, skimpy blocks compared to Philadelphia or Chicago), and how the railroads used the land-survey system to open up the continent while amassing enormous wealth.

In some ways, it's undoubtedly easier to keep track of events in Discworld if you read Pratchett's books in order, but jumping back and forth in the series is probably more in the spirit of things. This one is the first to feature the City Watch of Ankh-Morpork, Capt. Sam Vimes commanding. I had just finished reading *The Fifth Elephant*, written more than a decade later, and I have to say there are a few continuity errors -- but who cares. Here, we get to observe Vimes's first meeting with Lady Sybil Ramkin, breeder of swamp dragons and his future spouse, and we get some insight into the personality of the Librarian of Unseen University. We also meet Carrot, the six-and-a-half-foot-tall adopted dwarf, on his first introduction to the Watch. We see just how thorough and careful a hold Lord Vetinari has on the city. And we learn about the actual workings of dragons, how they create that fiery breath and so forth -- and why they so often have an abbreviated life span. As always, the author combines peculiarly bent Brit humor with a wise and witty take on serious social issues (in this case, the tendency of the People to go along with the loss of their own freedoms in embracing monarchy). However, as a lifelong librarian myself, I'm annoyed that Pratchett saw fit to reveal to the uninitiated the nature of L-space.	2005-01-17

McDevitt is capable of turning out thoughtful, literate, involving science fiction novels of very high quality indeed. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them. This is a not-quite-sequel to his excellent A TALENT FOR WAR, in that it is set in the same future and shares some of the same characters several thousand years from now, in a diverse, dispersed human galactic civilization. A space-going yacht, POLARIS, accompanies a group of scientific research ships to witness and record a rare stellar event. Aboard are half a dozen scientific, philosophical, and political luminaries. And they never return, though the ship itself is found, mysterious empty of life. Sixty years later, the disappearance of the passengers of POLARIS is still one of the great modern mysteries. Alex Benedict, now a prominent antiquities dealer, acquires a number of the personal possessions found on the derelict ship -- just before the rest of the artifacts are destroyed in an explosion. And now someone, or some organization, is trying to kill him off,  too. What does he unknowingly possess that could be that important? Well, McDevitt never quite makes it worth the reader's while to want to find out. The minutiae of life in his future are interesting at the beginning and help supply verisimilitude, but it gets a little old to be reading detailed descriptions of the lives of very minor characters when you're three hundred pages into the book. Also, it's an old sf device to casually mention the names of future historical figures in the company of names we would recognize from our own times, but McDevitt does this far, far too often -- and usually without giving any hint of who these great figures are. I'm prepared to believe, I guess, that a civilization that could produce a \\"quantum drive\\" (an improvement on mere FTL) still can't extend the human life span beyond 130 or so years, but that out not to have become the centerpiece of the plot. And I'm *not* willing to accept that ordinary people with only a basic education in that future are so conversant with the details of history and everyday life thousands of years in their past when few Americans in 2005 could pass a test on the lives of their ancestors only a few centuries ago.

The setting is Britain near the end of the 20th century (as seen from a grim, antidemocratic present when Margaret Thatcher was in power), a future in which a limited nuclear exchange between the U.S. and the Soviets has made much of the planet uninhabitable and a fascist takeover of Orwellian proportions has rid the UK of \\"undesirables.\\" One man, a survivor of medical experimentation in a concentration camp, is getting even with those who shot him full of drugs and hormones.

This book, published originally in three installments, is regarded as a turning point in graphic fiction, like DARK KNIGHT and WATCHMEN, but I just don't see it. Generally speaking, I like Gaiman's story lines, but this time it's all just confusing. The title character, a crime fighter superhero trying to infiltrate a mob, is killed in the first few pages -- but there's more of her back in the greenhouse so all is not lost. Or something. A newly hatched flower-woman, who seems to share some of the dead one's memories, sets out to uncover her identity. I think. The mob is run by Lex Luthor (why?), who wants to capture her and/or her little sister (or whatever) for dissection. But Carl, just out of prison, who used to work for Luthor and who previously murdered his wife, upon whom the orchids were based, can't get his job back and wants to get even with everyone. This guy is a loser and screw-up -- but suddenly, in the last installment, the action having relocated to the Amazon Basin, he becomes a very talented and successful jungle killer. (How?) Other people from the back-story weave in and out of the plot, including one who became the Swamp Thing, but none of what they say or do makes much sense. And why does Batman get a cameo? (Not to mentioned assorted bad guys from Gotham?) McKean's artwork is interesting for its own sake, owing more to oil painting than the usual sort of airbrush work, but all in all, I have to give this a shrug.	2005-01-03

Our arrangement has long been that she keeps track of our investments (also those of her parents and most of her siblings), works out what to do about them, and then explains it all to me (and them). But she still insists that I make an attempt to understand what's going on, and to that end she hands me books like this one. I have to say that, except for a sense of humor that tries too hard, Slott is better at providing a clear explanation of tax law and financial decision-making than many similar books I've waded through. His specialty is IRAs and similar retirement arrangements, and since I've just turned sixty, I'm paying attention to this stuff. After an introductory section explaining the jargon and describing the theory behind traditional and Roth IRAs, he launches into the details of his \\"Five Easy Steps\\": Timing (when and how much to take out of your IRA, including both the legal requirements and your own strategic needs), life insurance (to cover the taxes your beneficiaries will have to pay when they inherit your IRA), stretching the payout period (selecting a child as a beneficiary can keep the distributions going for decades after you're gone, allowing your bequest to keep growing), converting to a Roth IRA if possible (a great tax deal, especially for the beneficiaries), and avoiding estate taxes. Although he calls it \\"death taxes,\\" a partisan pejorative term I despise; there's far too much concentration of wealth in this country already. He also waxes on about the unfairness of the IRS and the tax code, forgetting the basic principal: Taxes aren't intended to be \\"fair,\\" they're intended to raise money for the government. Anyway, he does a good job of explaining the options the retiree faces at each step and in each new or variant situation, and he does it with resorting (much) to unexplained bizspeak, which certainly increases its accessibility for most of us.

I first read this epic when it first appeared nearly a decade ago, and I'm sure I'll read it again in another decade. The time is a century or so in the future, when the relative plenty provided by ubiquitous and extremely cheap nanotechnology has brought an end to the Age of Nation-States, which have been replaced by tribal societies based on ethnicity or religion or synthetic affiliations. John Percival Hackworth (\\"Percival\\" as in the Grail Quest, \\"Hackworth\\" as in a worthy hacker) is an engineering near-genius of the neo-Victorian \\"phyle\\" of Atlantis, situated on artificially created land just off the Chinese coast. Lord Finkle-McGraw has engaged him to produce an interactive learning system (to greatly understate the Primer's functions) for his seven-year-old granddaughter, Elizabeth. Hackworth also has a young daughter, Fiona, for whom he would do anything, so he endeavors to also make an illegal copy of the Primer for her. Things go awry, of course, and the stolen copy ends up in the hands of Nell (as in \\"Little Nell,\\" a melodrama heroine), who is a deprived cast-off loved only by her semi-shady brother, Harv. And that's where the book *really* starts, with Nell delving into the world of make-believe (but not really), learning over the next ten years of her life to be not only a Victorian lady but the queen of a new tribe -- which is also created (sort of) by the actions of Hackworth's Primer. But that's only a single plot line in this complicated but never confusing epic of technological imperialism, ancient Chinese destiny, personal fulfillment, and the pending arrival of a post-nanotech world society.

Another twenty years have now passed and we've come to know the characters of Lake Wobegon intimately: the locally wealthy Krebsbach family, Pastor Ingqvist and Father Emil, Herman Hochstetter and the annual Living Flag, the Sons of Knute, and the rules for visiting on front porches. But this book is where you'll found the multiethnic history of the town, how tiny Mist County was formed, and why neither of them appear on any map. Did you know the local paper, the _Herald-Star,_ got its name because it was bought by Harold Starr? Or why a Lutheran upbringing is likely to cause emigrants from Minnesota to compose their own Theses and look for a door to nail them to? (You'll find a hilarious and largely true list of ninety-five of them here.) Keillor has the gift of taking the small and ordinary, approaching them in a profoundly sympathetic yet skeptical way, and making them universal in their strength.	2004-12-19

Like Ropa Vieja or a Cuban Sandwich in Miami, or Cincinnati-style chili (always \\"five-way\\"), or a Garbage Plate in Rochester, or a Beef on Weck in Buffalo, Hot Brown in Louisville. I think I would argue that some of what the author considers \\"local cuisine,\\" though, is too widely available to qualify -- like Chicken-Fried Steak (which originated in south Texas but you can get it anywhere in the western half of the country), or breakfast tacos (now ubiquitous, even in supermarkets). She organizes dishes by courses, but there's a regional index in the back. Each recipe is introduced by a sometimes lengthy sociological essay. I have to say those for gumbo, muffulettas, and king cakes were pretty good renditions (though, naturally, everyone has their own \\"best\\" version). I believe I'll pass on the \\"prairie oysters\\" and the Hangtown Fry, though.	2004-12-19

Speaking as a professional librarian for more than three decades -- someone who upon visiting a city for the first time usually seeks out the main library for a look around -- there are libraries and then there are libraries. Even those in major U.S. cities tend to be utilitarian first (sometimes utilitarian only). Those dating from the 1950s and `60s are generally pretty ugly, as well. For richness and beauty, you have to go overseas to find libraries constructed in an earlier time, when architecture and ornamentation was an end in itself. Except for the small collections kept by monasteries, the library is pretty much an invention of the Renaissance and the Age of Reason. The National Library of Austria, in Vienna, is gorgeously Baroque, with allegorical paintings on the ceilings and narrow staircases concealed behind hidden doors in the stacks. The ever-suspicious Vatican Library still locks its bookcases, filled with bibliographical relics of incalculable value. The Senate Library in Paris is a blend of Neoclassical and Italianate, but it's very much a working library and the old card catalogue has been replaced by computers. I was privileged many years ago to visit the breathtaking library at the Abbey of Saint Gall, home of probably the world's most important collection of surviving incunabula. The curving bookshelves of inlaid wood, the hundreds of carved portraits, arms, and both religious and secular symbols are just incredible. And there's the Bodleian Library at Oxford, the first-ever university collection. And there are more than a dozen others in this beautifully produced volume, of which only three in the United States were deemed worthy of inclusion: the Library of Congress, the New York Public, and the Boston Athenaeum. All of which are practically new buildings compared to the others, but the same principal is at work -- to house knowledge in artistically serene surroundings. Remember the overhead shot of the LC's main Reading Room in *All the President's Men*? That says it all.dent's Men*? That says it all.	2004-12-17

I've read all of Baker's fiction and many of his essays and (except for his screed against periodicals on microform) I've enjoyed them all. He's inventive, he has a real ear for dialogue, and he's just weird enough to always keep your attention. Having said all that, I don't quite know what to make of this novel. Actually, it ought to be classified as a \\"novella,\\" since it's only 112 very small-sized pages, but let's not be picky. The whole thing consists of a dialogue between two old friends, Jay and Ben, in a Washington, DC, hotel room sometime in the summer of early fall of 2004. Ben is an academic, apparently (or occasionally) a college instructor, with an interest in 20th century political history. He's reasonably successful, judging by his comfortable lifestyle, and he has a wife and kids. Jay, who is divorced with kids, seems to be a drop-out of some sort from academe who has spent the past couple of years doing manual labor, including both the construction trades and commercial fishing. Ben is a pretty normal guy. Jay is a nutcase. Jay has decided George W. Bush needs assassinating, mostly because of the horrors he has inflicted on women, children, and other innocent civilians in Iraq, but also because of his general attitude toward the world. He has summoned Ben to hear and tape his explanation, so there will be a record of his motives. Ben, naturally, is fearful of being labeled an accomplice and hauled off to Guantanamo himself. The assassination is supposed to be accomplished with \\"special bullets\\" that Jay bought long-distance for $150 each. Along the way in their extended conversation, they discuss digital cameras vs. film, how to get what you really want from hotel room service, the sins of Wal-Mart vs. Target and Old Navy, and why all the U.S. presidents since Eisenhower (plus Lynne Cheney) have been no good. Well, okay. They both make a lot of good points. But what's the point of the book? When I got to the last page -- it doesn't actually \\"end,\\" it just stops -- I actually turned back a bit to see if I'd missed something. Nope. Very strange and self-indulgent. On the other hand, I wonder how long it will be before Dubya has Baker declared a danger to the public good and locked up without a trial. . . .just stops -- I actually turned back a bit to see if I'd missed something.

This author's method is to lead you into the story small detail by small detail, revealing characters' personalities and histories as needed, and -- in this case -- giving the reader a short course in the appalling history of the collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s and the mutual genocidal efforts of most of its ethnic groups. Ricky Colenso is an teenage idealist, scion of a wealthy U.S./Canadian family, and his desire to make a difference leads him to volunteer as an aid worker in Bosnia over the summer. Then he disappears (though the reader knows what happened to him before the other characters do) and his wealthy grandfather, a veteran of the Battle of Britain, pays a man known as the \\"Tracker\\" to uncover his fate. Later, he will also pay another specialist, the \\"Avenger\\" to bring Ricky's killer to justice. That would be the formula for a harrowing tale of revenge all by itself, but there's more: The targeted killer is being assisted by someone high up in the CIA as a matter of \\"the lesser evil for the greater good.\\" And all this is taking place in the summer and early fall of 2001. Forsyth leaves you to wonder whether a righteous attitude toward justice is necessarily the best way to go, knowing what we now know. This has the potential to make a terrific film.	2004-12-17

Back in the late '60s, I did a master's degree in U.S. history and my research dealt with several aspects of the Texas invasion of New Mexico under Col. John Baylor and the humiliation of federal troops at Mesilla in the summer of 1861. Naturally, I've been interested ever since in anything published on the subject of the Civil War in the southwest, so I hunted down this self-published volume, even though I finally had to go through Interlibrary Loan to get it. I'm not sure I should have bothered. Maj. Lynde was an incompetent who abandoned his post under threat from a much smaller Texan force, and who then allowed his troops to string themselves out during their flight up into the Organ Mountains -- with whiskey in their canteens instead of water, though Wadsworth doesn't seem to know about that, . .  and I helped dig up the empty bottles at the fort one summer. This idiotic behavior allowed Baylor to roll them up as he caught up with the straggling column with only one shot being fired. Wadsworth seems to think most of this was the fault of Lynde's superiors and subordinates, but there's plenty of blame to go around. In any case, one need only imagine the result if the two commanders had been switched -- if Baylor had been in command at Fort Fillmore. Is there any doubt the defenders of the fort would have sent their attackers packing? Or that the federal assault on the town of Mesilla would have been successful, had Baylor been the one leading it instead of resisting it, instead of the disaster it actually was for the Union troops? But interpretations aside, my biggest gripe about this exercise in special pleading is that Wadsworth seems never to have heard of the two standard books and more than a dozen journal articles on the subject written by Martin Hardwick Hall. Admittedly, the late Dr. Hall was my thesis advisor (and I was his R.A. for awhile), but his work is still important in any discussion of Baylor, Mesilla, or the Confederate Territory of Arizona.	2004-11-25

This is the first of Rankin's books I've read and I only picked up this one because of the title. (Looking at his list of previous works, he obviously goes in for flaky titles.) My response to the first couple of chapters was, \\"He's trying too hard.\\" I'm a longtime fan of Terry Pratchett, and that level of inspired and highly literate looniness is very difficult to attain, and maintain, without going overboard. But I stuck with it and I gradually found myself caught up in this tale of Jack the fortune-seeker in Toy City, his partnership with Eddie (who until recently was the teddy bear of Bill Winkie, private eye), and their efforts to catch the serial killer who's knocking off the Old-Rich human nursery characters in the city. The kindly, white-haired old Toymaker in his house up at the top of Knob Hill might be a god, or at least an assistant to one of the gods. And there's Jill, a scrumptious hooker with a heart of not-quite-gold, and Tinto, the clockwork bartender who is actually something considerably more. Like Pratchett, Rankin also takes the opportunity to get in some digs at the world we humans inhabit -- especially late in the book, when the truth about the present U.S. mis-administration comes out. Rankin is especially good at description and dialogue and I expect I'll try to hunt up some of his earlier books.	2004-11-21

I like various of this author's other books, but I'm sorry to say I couldn't get more than halfway into this one, at which point I gave up. The slow, almost plodding pace reminds me of Clifford Simak, but without the poetry. It's sort of an \\"after the apocalypse\\" story, but only one in ten thousand of the Earth's inhabitants don't welcome the end of the world as we know it. They'd rather have near-eternal life, even if it means fundamental changes in the meaning of \\"humaness.\\" In fact, it's hard to see just what the handful of holdouts object to; most of them are loser-types and not typical of the species. But the real problem is that Wilson spends far too much time and energy developing minor characters, and the major characters aren't all that believable in their response to Contact. Hardly compelling reading, regardless of what Walter Miller's jacket blurb says.	2004-11-21

This amazing, engrossing, mouth-watering volume is far more than a \\"cookbook,\\" the modest title notwithstanding -- it's a history of why Texans eat the way they do, why most Mexicans south of the Sonoran desert are contemptuous of chips-and-salsa, and where chile con carne really began. There are decades of photos of the best chili joints and upscale restaurants in the state, many of which I've eaten at over the years. The frontispiece is of the gondola at Casa Rio, where my high school senior class held parties, and there's even a picture (along with a bit of oral history) of Lucille Qui&ntilde;ones (whose family owned El Rancho restaurant), and whom I also knew in high school. (She went to Incarnate Word and many of the guys from my school dated girls there.) The chapter on the \\"chili queens\\" is fantastic and exceedingly well-written. The lengthy discussion of the \\"myth of authenticity\\" is spot-on, absolutely accurate, and will upset some self-righteous Texans, but who cares? The great food is the thing! And the recipes themselves, scattered among the history and the pictures, are excellent, including the classic method of making chili gravy at Molina's in Houston, and the pre-yuppified cheese enchiladas at Larry's down in Richmond, and the swooningly delicious version of chiles rellenos at Darios in Austin, and the justifiably famous puffy tacos at Henry's in San Antonio (where they were invented and don't let anyone tell you different). And if you want to know what Chicano rights protestors thought about the Frito Bandito commercials, or how David Pace got his salsa company started, or why the five Cuellar brothers let themselves be photographed in business suits and kitchen aprons, this is the place to come. In fact, Walsh, a noted food writer from Houston, has produced what is sometimes an almost scholarly work. I'm a pretty fair cook and I read a lot of cookbooks, but most of them come from the library and I buy very selectively. Five minutes of browsing through this one, though, and I had my credit card out, and now it's on my bedside table, filled with bookmarks. If you love serranos and combination plates and \\"true\\" Texas chili the way I do, you must own this book!

But his plots and characters definitely are complex, many-layered constructions, impossible to summarize in a review. But what the hell.<br /><br />Ruth Cole is a critically and financially successful novelist -- far more so than her father, Ted, a writer of rather creepy children's books and serial seducer of young mothers. The story begins in the summer of 1958 when Ruth, age four, is about to be deserted by her mother, Marion. The Coles had lost their two teenage boys in an automobile accident five years before (Ruth was an ill-advised attempt to replace them, sort of) and Marion is afraid to love another child. Ted makes it easy for her by hiring sixteen-year-old Eddie O'Hare from Phillips Exeter Academy as his \\"writer's assistant\\" for the summer. Eddie falls in love with Marion, they have a torrid three-month affair, and Eddie's life pattern is fixed. And the way Irving lays all this out, it's completely convincing, even though many of the other characters themselves raise their eyebrows at Eddie's fixation on older women.<br /><br />But that's only the beginning. Other major themes include squash as a metaphor for more profound psychic competition, and the nature of bravery and \\"domestic heroism,\\" and the nature of sexual accountability and of prostitution, and the connection between justified anger and revenge, and the life and fiction of Graham Greene (of whom Irving is a noted admirer). The author delves deeply into how a writer becomes a writer and what that does to perception of other people and of the world in general.<br /><br />It's been my experience that women authors generally do better with male protagonists than male writers do with women. Irving seems to be the exception, though, because Ruth Cole is so convincingly portrayed -- as a woman -- that you tend to forget the gender of the author.<br /><br />One of the most fascinating parts of the story is the genesis of Ruth's new novel during her book tour at the Frankfurt Book Fair and in Amsterdam: The gradual growth of the main plot in her unconscious, her search for the right protagonist and the best motivation for her actions, her understanding that she won't have a choice, in many ways, about how the book comes out. \\"I'm a comic novelist,\\" she thinks during one of her readings. \\"Half the audience will take this to mean that I am not a serious novelist. But comedy is ingrained. A writer doesn't choose to be comic. You can choose a plot, . . . you can choose your characters. But comedy is not a choice; it just comes out that way.\\" Notwithstanding that perceptive statement, this book contains some very comic scenes. Ted Cole's panicked flight on foot from his latest conquest in her big black Lincoln, which ends with him signing books, tattered and bleeding, in the local bookstore (a sanctuary reached by way of a privet hedge) verges on slapstick. And Ruth's careful dismantling of a violent lover with his own squash racket will have the women in the audience cheering.<br /><br />However, something else comes of her visit to Amsterdam and her tentative research for a new novel, which ends in one of the most baldly-narrated scenes of horror I've ever read.<br /><br />Foreshadowing is a useful technique for heightening tension, but it's difficult to do well, without giving away too much too soon. Irving, though, is a master of foreshadowing. There are perhaps a half-dozen major plot points in the story and while in each case you're aware that something is coming, you won't know what until you get there. Except for the Amsterdam section of the story. That one caught me completely off-guard.<br /><br />Almost everyone in this book loses someone.Even before the story opens, Ted and Marion have lost their sons. Ted loses his wife. Ruth loses her mother. Eddie loses the only woman he will ever love. Sergeant Hoekstra loses both his friend and the witness to her murder. Then Ruth loses her husband. Almost everyone, male and female, is in some sense a \\"widow.\\" This is one of those novels that will sit quietly on my shelves from now on, waiting for a periodic rereading -- which I promise it will have.Even before the story opens, Ted and Marion have lost their sons.

She has a larger agenda, but it will take the reader awhile to figure that out. She becomes involved with various questionable men, including a local CIA spook. The other gaijin protagonist is Tom Hurley, a junior diplomatic officer who's just floating through life. Then there's Kenzo Ota, a not very competent police inspector who becomes involved in trying to find out what happened to Lisa when she disappears. For some reason, the story is set in 1980, and easily the best part of the book is the look Lee gives us at the shadowy world of the Tokyo sex trade -- though the Japanese have a much more tolerant attitude toward such things than Americans. The plot, however, is perfunctory through much of the book, with absolutely no foreshadowing, so when Lee begins wrapping things up in the last couple of chapters, the solutions he springs on the reader are a series of rather unsatisfying surprises. Lisa herself is the only character toward whom one can feel any sympathy. Hurley is a total schmuck completely lacking in redeeming qualities. Kenzo is a naive, neurotic loner without a clue about the society in which he lives, and the spook is simply manipulative, as are many of the supporting cast. The background is interesting but the ideas are poorly developed and the author's style is almost amateurish.	2004-11-06

The protagonist of each is a woman, but they're not \\"women's novels\\" -- or not merely that, anyway. This one isn't a mystery, as some of her best have been, but it's certainly suspenseful. Thirty-year-old Amy Lincoln (\\"no relation\\") is a more-than-competent New York political analyst and journalist at IN DEPTH, a magazine so serious it doesn't run pictures at all. Despite her degrees from Harvard and Columbia School of Journalism, she grew up in the projects, the daughter of a mostly likeable but only semi-successful small-time criminal and a mother who disappeared when she was a few months old, dumping her in the reluctant lap of her Grandma Lil, a part-time leg-waxer. Her background left her with a rather confrontational style and very chary of commitment in relationships, even though for two years she's been with the pretty much terrific John Orenstein, a documentary film maker who pushes all her passion buttons but with whom she is convinced she ought to break up. But all that is just the background to this multilayered story. While covering a private money-raiser by a presidential candidate, she witnesses a young, personable gate-crasher's claim to be the senator's illegitimate son. As she gets involved, against her better ethical judgment, with his quest for acceptance, she comes to the realization that she must also uncover the truth about her own mother and the theft of a diamond ring that sent her father to jail for the first time. She's an expert researcher and (speaking as someone in a similar line of work) I found the process fascinating. But Amy's search is only the means to discovering who she is, whether she's really her mother's daughter in terms of bent psychology, and what to do about John. The story is set, rather pointedly, against the backdrop of the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq, but I'm not sure I see the relevance. And there are also frequent flashback references to the events of September 11, as is probably inevitable for any future novel set in present-day New York City, but at least they play some part in the characters' personal lives. This certainly isn't a \\"funny\\" book, but Isaacs's dry wit and droll capsule descriptions add a leavening of humor that keeps things on an even keel. And her spot-on depictions of the supporting characters are marvelous.

Dexter Morgan is a thirty-year-old blood-spatter specialist working for the Miami-Dade police crime lab. He's an expert at his job, liked -- or at least accepted -- by most of his coworkers, and a person of interest to several women, including incompetent homicide detective LaGuerta. He's also a fully self-aware and quite inhuman monster, the product of some undescribed familial trauma in his early youth, who has spent his life learning to fake the emotions he doesn't possess naturally. He was coached in this by his foster father, Harry, a highly-regarded cop who recognized what young Dexter really was and taught him to turn it to positive uses. Now, when the Dark Passenger who resides in his mind decides, periodically, that it's time to come out and play, Dexter always has someone lined up who deserves to die slowly. Perhaps a child-killer, or a pathological hospice nurse who's too free with the morphine, or simply a warped priest. Because Dexter does his best not to harm the \\"innocent.\\" He also tries to help his foster sister, Deb, a lusciously-built vice cop who doesn't really know how to be a girl, feels comfortable only in a blue uniform, and wants more than anything to graduate to Homicide. She also seems to have unspoken suspicions about her brother's ability to predict how killers will think and act. Now there's a serial killer on the loose -- another one besides Dexter, that is -- and Dexter is fascinated by his artistic technique and longs to meet him, even though he's also worried. Especially since he seems to know too many details about his rival. What if the Dark Passenger is more in control than he thought? What if Dexter himself is the other killer? This appears to be Lindsay's first novel and it's an extremely original, beautifully thought-out thriller. Dexter is not Hannibal Lector and the reader will quickly become sympathetic and anxious for him to survive -- before being brought up short by a reminder of just what his hobby interests consist of. Dexter's self-deprecating interior monologues, his ruminations on his own nature, his memories of Harry's careful training, all are delightful, thought that hardly seems the word that ought to apply. And, finally, that last chapter is a pip.

There's Polly, daughter of Elaine and Nick, a very \\"here and now\\" young woman working as a web designer who rather takes after her mother but who also doted on her radiant, fun-loving aunt. And there's Oliver, Nick's ex-partner in their failed specialty publishing firm. It was Oliver who innocently took the photo that showed Nick and his sister-in-law secretly holding hands, which he forwarded to Nick, which Nick sent on to Kath -- assuming she would destroy it. But Kath thoughtlessly tucked it away to be found by Glyn years later. And Glyn now has a new project: Assembling all the data he can ferret out on his late wife's life while he was away attending conferences and doing research. Were there other men in her life besides Nick? It doesn't matter that it all happened fifteen years ago: He must know. And the repercussions of his investigation on all involved are considerable. But it appears that no one who knew Kath *really* knew her. Lively's exquisite, highly readable style is guaranteed to keep you glued to the page and thinking about her characters and their stories while you're supposed to be doing something else.	2004-10-26

When this time-travel classic first appeared thirty years ago, I was a grad student in history and my mind was full of the academic debate over the nature of causality -- so Gerrold's thoughts on the subject made quite an impression on me. I stole his arguments shamelessly for use in the TA lounge. I had met him at a con a couple of years before, when his reputation derived almost entirely from tribbles, and I believed at the time that he was going places. Sadly, he never quite made the big time and I imagine most younger discoverers of science fiction have never heard of him. Still, any fan of time travel fiction knows this book well and I doubt anyone can ever match the psychological and philosophical complexity of Dan Eakin's life in possession of the Timebelt. This artifact is the only one of its kind (logically, when you think about it) and so Dan is the only time traveler, . . . but there's plenty of him to go around, because time travel is actually the creation of alternate realities. There are young Dans and old ones, hetero- and homosexual versions, even male and female. Some go insane, some become degenerate. Some find love, some lose it. But Dan is his own universe: \\"I am a circle, complete unto itself. I have brought life into this world, and that life is me.\\" If you're looking for a Time Patrol adventure yarn, this isn't it. (There isn't even all that much plot in the usual sense.) But if you want to think about the consequences of personal, individual time travel, you can't do any better than this one.	2004-10-16

Family reunions are not, for many of us, as basic a part of family research as they might be, and books on the subject usually reflect that. If most of your relatives still live within a day's drive, you probably see them regularly and an annual picnic is almost a routine event, dedicated to introducing new offspring and remembering the recently deceased. If your family is scattered all over the country, as is true of probably a majority of the American population these days, a reunion becomes a special event with a significant outlay in time and money for both planners and attendees, but the activities are still largely the same. But Sandy Clunies, a Certified Genealogist and frequent speaker at the national level, is a very experienced family researcher and past winner of the NGS Family History Writing Contest, so her interest here is primarily in the role of genealogy at the family reunion. How could any attentive researcher pass up the chance to graze among all those memories and experiences brought together for a few days in one place?<br /><br />Putting on a reunion can be an overwhelming task, but (to quote the author's grandmother) you can eat an elephant if you cut it into bite-sized pieces. \\"What kind of show should it be?\\" she asks. Do you need a theme? Is there to be a central event, like a milestone anniversary or the dedication of a DAR grave marker? Will it be potluck at a state park? A gathering at the ancestral family farm? Or a Caribbean cruise? The most important rule, though is Plan Ahead. At least a year - preferably two if it's to be a big event. The second rule is Take a Businesslike Approach. This includes record keeping, not only to properly account for finances but to provide information for future reunions. (Detailed attendance records from family gatherings held a century ago have become valuable resources in their own right.) The Internet, naturally, is a great help in locating those whom you want to invite, especially if you've been out of touch for a few years, and the author gives detailed advice (plus encouraging anecdotes) on the use of search engines and message boards for this purpose. You will also want to advertise your reunion online in order to alert those individuals you weren't able to locate. Many suggestions of an historical and genealogical nature are provided for activities (house and cemetery tours, living history demonstrations), and for showcasing the family's history (enlargements of photos collected in advance, displays of inherited artifacts). And, of course, a series of oral history sessions is an opportunity not to be missed, with memories triggered by old photos and conversations with other descendants. To preserve all you've been able to learn, a post-reunion book (with sales solicited during the event) will not only provide a permanent record, it will help establish a tradition of future reunions and encourage wider attendance. A family website can present new information acquired, woven into what was already known, and can also encourage further research -- and advance planning for the next get-together. Even though I'm not a big reunion-attender, this is by far the best book I've seen on the subject.of touch for a few years, and the author gives detailed advice (plus encouraging anecdotes) on the use of search engines and message boards for this purpose.

The author's last book, and the first one of his I'd read, was *The End of Alice*, and it was, well, not exactly fun, but kind of weird and definitely interesting. This one is also weird, but not nearly as interesting. I picked it up because a friend saw me reading *The Ice Storm* and recommended this as a contemporary novel of the highly dysfunctional family. And the Weisses are certainly that. Paul and Elaine, both forty-ish, swing between passionate sex and sniping based on mutual loathing. In a fit of psychic panic (or something), they collaborate in tipping over a charcoal grill and setting fire to their house, after which they pack the kids in the car and hightail it to a motel. But the house is only damaged, not destroyed (denying them their new start), and they have to stay with their perfect neighbors. Or not-so-perfect, actually. And Paul discovers the luxury of sleeping in a lacy nightgown. And Elaine discovers lesbian sex. And their twelve-year-old son begins collecting evidence of the arson. And there's The Date, who frequently calls on Paul's cell phone, and Paul's ill-conceived tattoo, and some truly strange commuters on the train. And all of this should lead to fascinating, culturally illuminating characters and situations, but that somehow never happens. Too bad.	2004-10-15

Twenty years ago, using only a very simpleminded computer as a glorified typewriter, I put together a thick volume of lineage on part of my wife's family, the result of more than a decade of close research. Because of my very limited budget, the production values were poor and fewer than two hundred copies were printed and mailed. And it took nearly all my free time for a year. Today, I would be able to compile all that data in a computer program, produce text files for further editing, present the final version in an attractive, readable, completely cross-indexed format, and upload the whole thing to a website where it could be visited by many thousands of other researchers from around the world. I could correct and update the information as new data came to hand. And I could do it all with little or no out-of-pocket expenditure. Is it any wonder genealogists have so enthusiastically adopted the World Wide Web as their medium?<br /><br />Any genealogist who isn't familiar with \\"Cyndi's List of Genealogy Sites on the Internet\\" hasn't been paying attention for far too many years. Cyndi Howells owns a website indexing more than 200,000 online resources, and which gets several million hits each month. She's also a member of the NGS Board of Directors and the author of several other books on Internet genealogy. So: Do you need your own genealogy website? Cyndi thinks you do. \\"Trust me, you need one.\\" Publishing on the Web is the least expensive and mostly widely accessible method of disseminating to others what you've learned.<br /><br />Howells notes that she could have subtitled this volume \\"All the Things Cyndi Learned the Hard Way,\\" and the reader should be thankful for her experiences. Through reviewing the sites that make it to Cyndi's List, she has become more aware than most of us of what really works online, and what really, really doesn't. Her approach combines \\"high concept\\" and style on the one hand with practical, hands-on advice on the other. Though she doesn't try to teach the very basics of computers or the Internet, she walks the reader step-by-step through the process of \\"planting\\" a website: Finding a hosting service (your ISP probably provides space for free), choosing your tools (there are some good free choices here, too), the differences between writing your own HTML code and letting your genealogy software produce it for you (a somewhat contentious matter, actually), enhancing your site with photos and digitized documents, and the growing problem of proliferation of inaccurate data because of unthinking copyright infringement. There are a lot of decisions to make first, though. Do you want to construct a full-featured site, with sections on local history as well as purely family matters? Or would you rather just submit your own database to be included in an online lineage-linked database? It's a matter of maintaining control. Should you start now? Or wait until you've \\"finished\\"? That's print-thinking. When you can continually change and update, why wait? Your research is always a work-in-progress anyway.<br /><br />The author recommends a mission statement as a guide to keep you pointed in the right direction and Chapter 10, \\"Guarantee Success,\\" discusses a number of common website do's and don'ts (like avoiding border-type backgrounds that don't wrap properly). Then she confronts the problems of presentation (artsy vs. readable), site navigation, establishing a baseline structure for your site, and deciding what content to include. (You don't have to build the entire site all at once.) Then it's time to create the basic pages (keeping in mind that you don't have to accept your software's defaults), probably using a WYSIWYG editor to produce the HTML until your sophistication increases. And for all of this, Howells provides many addresses to online resources that provide additional instruction and advice. She can be rather opinionated about design, as in the matter of blinking text: \\"If it moves, delete it.\\" And \\"Frames are evil.\\" And also unexpected music files that play automatically (a real annoyance when you're surfing the Web in a public library). She's usually right, though.<br /><br />Finally, she tells you how to upload your work, how to carry out the necessary trial run, and how to publicize your site. Don't forget, too, that running a website of any kind is an active, ongoing process. (Few things are sadder than a Web page whose \\"Last Updated\\" date was three years ago.) You're making a commitment in time, if not in money. Establish a maintenance routine and update your site regularly. Check and update the dead links you've included to other sites. (There's a word for this: linkrot.) If necessary, you can solicit help in doing all this from other family researchers -- especially those you've met through your site.<br /><br />I've read numerous books on website design, as well as having planned and set up several sites for other family members (and not just in genealogy), and this is easily the best thing I've found -- print or online -- for the genealogist interested in establishing a presence on the Web..\\" And \\"Frames are evil.\\" And also unexpected music files that play automatically (a real annoyance when you're surfing the Web in a public library).

Still, anyone publishing a new basic textbook faces stiff competition. The more expert and experienced the author, the more accurate the information presented is going to be, and Renick is certainly a widely-known and respected author and lecturer, as well as an experienced teacher. Moreover, she combines attention to the most essential lessons in fundamental genealogical instruction with an easy, informal style, successfully walking the narrow line between textbookishness and superficial offhandedness. She expects her audience to include not only complete novices, but those who attempted unsuccessfully to carry out family research without foreknowledge of methods and sources, and also those who have picked up bits of information on the Internet and don't quite know what to do with them. Of course, any well-written text can also serve as a refresher for the experienced family researcher.<br /><br />For all these classes of reader, the author makes her key points early and often: Start with yourself. Record everything you find, and everything you don't find. Cite your sources for all of it. Don't throw anything out or disregard information that might be useful later, or to someone else. Don't make assumptions about names or dates or places, or anything else. There are excellent chapters on basic method (including answers to such beginners' questions as \\"How far back can I go?\\"), interviewing relatives (because Renick assumes you're interested primarily in researching your own family first, not someone else's), assembling your results in a logical way that identifies your next set of questions (organization is everything), and why and how to profitably use computers in keeping track of your research (without taking sides over the question of \\"best\\" software, though she uses Legacy for examples). She tends to spend less time on the best genealogical use of Internet resources, referring the reader instead to Online Roots, another volume in this series which is reviewed below. She'll show you in detail how to begin what she calls the Survey Phase and how to progress through it to the Research Phase, including how to document your search, how genealogists prefer to handle dates and abbreviations (and why), and goal-setting as a research tool. She covers libraries of all types, writing and reading queries, commercial electronic databases (though I wish she hadn't mentioned Brøderbund's World Family Tree series so uncritically), and the evaluation of compiled sources and published family histories. Then comes the Evaluation Phase, including how to properly evaluate data and construct hypotheses for testing, and how to recognize success when you experience it. (It's not always obvious.)<br /><br />Finally, she addresses the questions of publishing what you've discovered (not just to stroke egos but to preserve your labors for future researchers), preserving photographs and fragile documents, whether or not you should consider joining lineage societies, and the role of serendipity, which genealogists learn early never to underestimate. You may need to consult a professional at some point, perhaps to carry out research for you overseas, and she provides excellent advice on all aspects of this complex subject. You may even want to become a \\"professional\\" of some kind yourself. And throughout all of this, Renick strews carefully targeted, tightly drawn anecdotes, taken mostly from her own diverse family, as illustrations of what she's saying.<br /><br />So: Is this the \\"best book available\\"? It may well be. It's certainly a very strong contender. Anyone teaching a basic genealogy class could do far worse than to adopt this as their textbook. If you have a younger relative you're trying to interest in taking up the family's history, give them a copy. If you think you're too experienced to need a book with \\"101\\" in the title, read it anyway. You won't regret it.think you're too experienced to need a book with \\"101\\" in the title, read it anyway. You won't regret it.	2004-10-15

And, as much as he loves Miami, he's certainly not blind to the failings of his home town, where gun-ownership is a given. His first novel is part Marx Brothers, part Carl Hiaasen, part Goofy-on-dope, all set in the Miami suburb of Coconut Grove. Eliot Arnold is an ex-newsman struggling to make it with his small advertising agency, while his teenaged son, Matt, plays \\"Killer\\" with squirt guns. Matt's intended victim, Jenny, is the daughter of Arthur Herk, vice-president and bag man for a thoroughly corrupt and murderous local corporation, whose days may be numbered as a result of his not-bright embezzling. And there's Puggy, a street person living in a tree in the Herk's walled yard, who has a thing for their illegal maid, Nina. Puggy also works (sort of) for two Russian ex-army chislers who own a run-down bar as a front for their arms-dealing operation. And there's Snake and Eddie, small-time grifters who decide to make a big score -- bigger than they know, unfortunately. And there's FBI agents and assorted cops and several overlapping love stories and a very suspicious metal suitcase. (Now I've gotta see the movie!)	2004-10-15

I picked this up thinking it was a collection of original alternate history stories, but it's not quite that. Many of the stories do involve \\"what-if\\" plot points, but they're rooted in fantasy -- but not of the Tolkienesque variety, either. In Stephen Dedman's \\"Twilight of Idols,\\" for instance, Adolf Hitler kills a dragon straight out of the Niebelungen, making him more or less invulnerable (how do you think he escaped injury from that bomb?), but the rest of his career fits more into the \\"secret history\\" category. Michelle West's \\"To the Gods Their Due\\" is a cautionary tale about Alexander and the price to be paid for quasi-immortality, and while it's a well-written story, there's nothing especially \\"fantastic\\" about it. (I don't think access to a soothsayer counts.) \\"Intensified Transmogrification,\\" by Barry Malzberg and Bill Pronzini, is a brief alternate history about LBJ with no fantasy element that I can discern.

Pretty soon, your two ring-binders have become a packed four-drawer file cabinet and you haven't seen your dining room table in months. Ann Fleming, president of NGS and a family researcher of wide experience, wants to save you from all that. The question is whether it takes an entire book to do it. She begins with all the reasons and ways you should organize your work and your results from the very beginning, including a discussion of file folders versus ring-binders, spiral pads versus a laptop computer or PDA, keeping to-do lists and a research notebook to focus you on the particular task at hand, and so on. Then she proceeds to the proper use of those basic research-tracking forms we all learned about in our first genealogical month: Pedigree charts, family group sheets, and research and correspondence logs. In the following chapters, she expands the discussion to more specialized forms and record-keeping methods, including those for federal and state census schedules, courthouse-type vital records, military records, wills and probates, land research, city directories, church records (though I'm not sure how such a diverse body of information can be handled on a standardized form), immigration and naturalization files, cemetery records and surveys, and school and medical records, among others. And all those forms appear as PDF files on the CD that accompanies the book. She recommends you write a research report to further focus you on what you hope to accomplish during a particular project or research trip, including an individual or family timeline, and she makes excellent suggestions generally on preparing yourself for that trip, whether to Salt Lake City or to a nearby rural county. (Yes, you really need to do a preliminary literature search and review what you already know.) The sections on how and why to care for family photos (don't just discard all those you can't identify), the necessity of a disaster plan (duplicate and back up your files in another location, one that will survive the next flood or tornado), and why you should have plans in place for the final disposal of all your work when you're no longer around.<br /><br />However, Fleming also spends far too much time providing discursive details (and many personal anecdotes) on the interpretation of all these records, which seems outside the scope of a book on organizing one's research. She includes thirty pages of detailed discussion of the questions asked on each of the decennial U.S. censuses, for example, plus several pages on the Soundex and Miracode systems, another sixteen pages of details on American wars, and a lengthy discussion of how to interpret the terminology found in marriage and probate records. Much of this is, by necessity, generic. (No mention is made of the peculiarities of Louisianian legal jargon, for instance, which is of particular interest to me and the other local researchers I know.) She tells you about the online Civil War Soldier System, recommends techniques for oral history interviews, reminisces about inheriting family heirloom furniture, discusses good courthouse etiquette, and describes the differences between microfilm and microfiche, the Register numbering system and how to conduct a cemetery survey. There's useful information on the national Interlibrary Loan program, the IGI, PERSI, and photo-enhancement software -- but none of it really belongs in this book.<br /><br />Finally, she goes into a certain amount of detail on organizing your information for publication, either in print or on the Web, but what she says actually applies to organizing your genealogical data for any purpose, and much of it repeats what she has said earlier. She even discusses style sheets for publishing and provides a chart of U.S. postal codes (the use of which actually should be avoided in publication). The problem here is that the subject of genealogical publishing requires another full volume in this series, not just the twenty-odd pages at the end of this one.<br /><br />In her attempt to be all things to all genealogists, Fleming never quite presents a single coherent system for organizing one's genealogical records and materials, either. I don't say she should have done so, necessarily. William Dollarhide and many others have developed and promoted their own schemes, all with good and bad points, and one understands that the series editor wants to appeal to the widest spectrum of possible readers - but when the advice is too general, its usefulness is greatly diminished. It might also have been useful to include tips for designing and developing one's own forms (perhaps by providing templates on the CD) for more specialized purposes, like the UK and Canadian censuses, German parish research, and transcribing ship lists.<br /><br />To one with experience in publishing, it's pretty obvious what has happened here: In order to keep all the volumes in this series roughly the same size (which can be sold at the same price), considerable extraneous information had to be added to what would have made a good fifty-page section in a different book.

I have long maintained that online research is simply the (sometimes) more convenient continuance by other means of traditional, tried and true methods. There is no \\"royal road to genealogy,\\" no universal database from which you can immediately download your entire lineage back to Adam. Most of the books I've seen fall into two categories: Introductions to traditional genealogy with a thin icing of information on genealogical software and Internet how-to, and \\"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about Computers and the Internet\\"-type volumes that include specific genealogical applications as an afterthought. There are a few, like Elizabeth Powell Crowe's *Genealogy Online: Researching Your Roots* (1998), Matt Helm's *Genealogy Online for Dummies* (1998), and Pamela Hahn's *The Unofficial Guide to Online Genealogy* (2001), which actually are quite useful and are worth reading (though all three are inevitably becoming dated), but these are very much the exception. The rest are simply exercises in marketing.<br /><br />Pam Porter is a Certified Genealogical Records Specialist, a very experienced author and lecturer who has edited the APG QUARTERLY and presently serves on the FGS Board of Trustees. Amy Crow, a Certified Genealogist, also is well-known as an author and speaker, has served on the boards of several national organizations, and chairs First Families of Ohio. (She also is the overall editor for this series.) And the acknowledgments section lists many other names that are immediately recognizable. Their stated target audience includes (1) those new to genealogy but seasoned computerists, (2) those experienced in family research but novices online, and (3) those new to both. In other words, almost everyone. But it's encouraging to note that the third paragraph includes the explicit warning, \\"No, it's not all online yet.\\" Yes, field trips to courthouses and libraries and your local Family History Center are still necessary. But more and more information is indeed being made available online everyday, especially by government agencies for whom online public access is a great money-saver in terms of staff time. The authors point out, too, that much of what you'll find online, while not necessarily an answer to a specific relationship question, provides easily accessible contextual information -- county histories, details of migration patterns in previously unexplored states, the locations of railroad corporate archives, and similar data to help you to profitably focus your research. But \\"you won't be able to construct your entire family history on the Web.\\" Planning your online research is not that different from planning a library or courthouse visit -- it's still a matter of defining goals, identifying which facts you need to uncover, finding the sources for them, analyzing the results, and recording and evaluating what you're learned - but now you're using search engines and \\"pathfinder\\" sites instead of (or in addition to) card catalogs and document indexes. When you do get ready to make a courthouse visit, the Web will assure you that you've identified the right one, and often will tell you whether they're likely to have the class of records you need, and for the right time period. Moreover, you can save on gas and stretch your research budget, and you can carry on your research on Sundays or in the middle of the night if you care to. Their recommended \\"Internet Research Log\\" is remarkably similar to the classic courthouse log we all use (or should). One of the best uses of the Internet, in my own experience, has been in locating other researchers with intersecting interests, something which was very time-consuming and very hit-or-miss in the old days. The chapters on \\"Finding People in the Modern Era\\" and \\"Sharing with Others\\" provide excellent guidance on carrying out such a quest as well as turning up those long-lost distant cousins your grandfather told you about. The U.S. census (and also, now, those in the UK) is largely available online these days -- the actual images, not just printed transcripts or extracts -- and much of that now is accompanied by searchable every-name indexes that far outstrip the old Soundex and Miracode files. Naturalization records and federal land purchase records are now coming rapidly online. So are local property records. And back runs of newspapers. And older military records and unit histories. And there's hardly a library anymore without an online-accessible catalog, which is a boon to Interlibrary Loan users. And yet, while outlining these exciting advances and interspersing the discussion with frequent screen shots from useful websites, the authors keep hammering on the important point: The essentials of research haven't really changed! You still have to think and analyze and evaluate! Although any book on such a volatile subject will begin to be out of date almost as soon as it's published, I have to say this is one of the best treatments I have seen.ience, has been in locating other researchers with intersecting interests, something which was very time-consuming and very hit-or-miss in the old days.

This second novel may lose him some of his readership -- those who expect him to write only silly stuff. Because this caper yarn, while funny in places (especially the ongoing jokes concerning the suicidal TV newsroom and the Hawaiian infomercials), is also somewhat darker and more grown-up. It all revolves around an oceangoing South Florida casino and the nefarious uses to which its owners put it. Spiraling in to the climactic events on the EXTRAVAGANZA OF THE SEAS are the members of a band of low expectations (especially Wally, the lead guitar), two elderly refugees from a retirement home, a stressed-out bar hostess, a tall blonde with digestive problems, a ship's captain trying to live down his past, a guy in a pink conch costume, a psychopathic drug-runner, and an assortment of professional heavies, many of whom won't be returning to Miami. If Barry continues developing in this direction, he'll be giving Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiaasen a serious run for their money.	2004-10-14

I'm a fan of superhero-type post-1970s comics, especially when they're compiled in graphic novel form (so you don't have to wait for the next installment), but I prefer the \\"realistic\\" school invented in _Watchmen_ and _The Dark Knight_ series over the Marvel variety. Stories in which the hero isn't necessarily all that heroic, set in a grubby sort of world not unlike our own. Sort of an alternate universe in which superheroes or extraordinary mortals can exist. That's what Busiek says he's after here, but he's not all that successful. This may have to do more with the fact that the seven stories in this volume each center on a different hero and don't adequately relate to each other. The focus is very fuzzy. There are too many references made to events and people the reader knows nothing about, if he hasn't already read all the original comics. And the characterizations are rather trite, too. Samaritan is a workaholic, Winged Victory is a go-it-alone feminist, Beautie is a Barbie doll (literally), Crackerjack is a jerk, and we learn nothing at all about Starwoman, the Deacon, the Furst Family, or most of the other walk-ons. The best story in the book, almost by degault, is \\"Safeguards,\\" about a woman from a Third-Worldish corner of the city where ghosties and ghoulies still survive, who is trying to make a career downtown. This whole thing could have been much, much better.	2004-10-04

At their best, and for those American readers willing to attune themselves to it, British authors can produce a particular kind of laid-back, raised-eyebrow, highly literate humor that is a joy to read. Especially Terry Pratchett: As any wife of a fan of the Discworld novels knows, one experiences an unavoidable urge to quote out loud from his work at length. Neil Gaiman, on the other hand, is known not for humorous writing but for his rather dark Sandman comics -- and yet the two make an admirable team. Putting it briefly, the plot here is about Armageddon, the end of everything. Crowley (whose name used to be \\"Crawley,\\" back when his job was being the serpent in the Garden) is a general stirrer-upper based in London, especially by designing infernal highway systems. Aziraphale is an angel (unfallen) whose original job was to wave a flaming sword and chase Adam and Eve away from the Garden, but he's now a rare book dealer. Like competing undercover agents everywhere, the two long ago reached an understanding by which neither of them rocks the other's boat too vigorously and everybody gets along. Besides, both rather like the human race and neither wants to see a final end to the world. Things promise to get dicey, however, when the Antichrist is swapped out for a human newborn -- except that the satanic nun in charge of the operation (i.e., Sister Mary Loquacious) screws up and the wrong infant leaves the hospital designated as the son of Satan. The real changeling, whose name (of course) is Adam, grows up as an almost ordinary boy in the village of Lower Tadfield and is now eleven years old. Which also happens to have been the home, three hundred years ago, of Agnes Nutter, witch, and the author of the only absolutely accurate book of prophecy ever published. Who is the ancestor of Anathema Device, present-day psychic newly come to Tadfield to try to sort things out. Who gets involved with the somewhat pathetic but well-meaning Newton Pulsifer, a private in the two-man Witchfinder Army. There's also the Four Motorcyclists of the Apocalypse (Death speaks all in CAPITAL LETTERS -- obviously Pratchett's contribution), and the Hound of Hell, who becomes a small, scruffy mongrel at the insistence of his master and rather enjoys it. All in all, it's hard to imagine a more delightful, more whacked-out, more determinedly irreverent antidote to LaHaye's \\"Left Behind\\" series.o-man Witchfinder Army.

I was taken with Maisie Dobbs, the first book in this new series, not so much as a mystery novel but as a portrait of England, especially London, at the end of the 1920s and the lingering effects of the Great War on the survivors of that generation. Maisie is a sort of combination consulting detective, practical psychologist, and freelance social worker. She takes a holistic approach to her cases, insisting that everything, including all personal relationships, be wrapped up to her own satisfaction, not merely to the client's. Her methods often are what we would think of as New Age, and one almost expects her to begin quoting from Madame Blavatsky -- a part of her personality I could do without, frankly. This time, Maisie's looking for the thirty-year-old daughter of a grocery store magnate who has fled her father's mansion, and not for the first time. She eventually locates the young woman, who has sought refuge both from her father and from her own past, but she also comes to realize that the case is connected to a recent murder and another death which appears to be a suicide. And then a third woman dies gruesomely, and Maisie must protect her subject, who might be next on the killer's list. Again, it all goes back to the War, this time focusing on the \\"White Feather\\" girls, whose thoughtless pseudo-patriotism brought grief to many families, including that of Maisie's client, and also of her assistant, Billie Beale. There's more \\"mystery\\" in this installment than in the first book, but Maisie still grates a bit. She's awfully goody-goody and I suspect trying to be friends with her could be a trial. Still, I'll be looking forward to Winspear's next effort.	2004-09-26

Question, upon first picking up this massive volume: What kind of graphic novel runs 582 pages? Answer: In this case, a great one. The narrator (who happens coincidentally) to have the same name as the author) is a thoughtful and artistic young man in rural/small-town Wisconsin who tries hard to make sense of the world, and whose early response is to be \\"saved\\" -- which is an easy decision, considering his family and community. He has a classic love/hate relationship with his younger brother, with whom he has to share a bed when he's little, and he finds himself the target of the huntin', fishin' crowd in school. At church camp one winter, he meets Raina, a Michigan girl of similarly outsider persuasion, and the two come together like magnets. That winter, he goes to visit her for two weeks and they fall in love, though they don't (I think) quite become actual lovers. It's a very sweet time, even though Craig has to adjust to the dynamics of a different sort of family, one with two \\"challenged\\" adopted children in it, in which Raina's parents are on the brink of divorce. And when he returns home, things are never quite the same. In fact, life becomes rather sad. Even his breakup with Raina is sad. Craig is a very likable character, though his answer to inner turmoil seems to be to burn his past. Thompson's art is simple black-and-white, but very nuanced and very affecting. His storytelling is subtle and quiet but it will take control of your heart and mind for awhile. But he doesn't pull any punches regarding the trauma of growing up. He also makes an excellent case for the insidious effect of early indoctrination in narrowminded fundamentalist Christianity in producing either flaming hypocrites (i.e., most of Craig's peers) or, if they're as reflective as the narrator, burned-out apostates. I'm going to be thinking about this wonderful story for a long time.	2004-09-22

Rebecca, her lifelong best friend, is much prettier, less volatile, and pretty much lets Enid run her life. They observe and discuss the people they know, reflect on their childhood memories, and avoid discussing what their lives might be like without each other.

But he doesn't just spin yarns -- he relates entire short stories, with fully developed characters, proper pacing, and slyly nuanced dialogue. He's also a master of the dryly witty digression. Most of his fans know him from Prairie Home Companion and \\"The News from Lake Woebegon,\\" but this book -- arguably his best -- shows another whole side of his talent, focusing on the obvious love of his life: radio. The interwoven chapters of this book, in fact, originally appeared as short stories. They tell of the founding of Station WLT in Minneapolis by the Soderbjerg brothers in 1926 in an effort to boost patronage of their luncheonette, how radio took over their lives once they reluctantly accepted commercials, how the Golden Age of \\"radiation\\" in their rented studios in the Hotel Ogden made them wealthy, and how an entire generation of performers, announcers, engineers, writers, and office workers spent most of their lives there, loving the job and hating it, and loving and hating each other. Some scenes really stand out, like Dad Benson's handling of the news from Pearl Harbor in 1941; Francis With, fresh from North Dakota, landing a job as general flunky; Francis's encounter in the Green Room with child star Marjery Moore; the depiction of the antics in the baseball field press box; the reactions of a group of performers to a very suggestively written script; and, finally, the brainstorm of an ambitious biographer in the very last chapter. The fifty years of friction between Ray and Roy Sr. is a hoot, the imaginings of Patsy Konopka about her upstairs neighbor are delicious, and the adventures of the gospel-singing Shepherds on a punitive road tour are both sad and hilarious. Some readers have been upset by the discovery that Keillor actually knows some profanity and considers sex funny, but that's a very shortsighted view. But these are just people and you can't help liking most of them, even the venal ones. The author knows the truth, too, about the demise of radio: \\"Radio was a dream and now it's a jukebox. It's as if planes stopped flying and sat on the runway showing travelogues.\\" Great stuff.them, even the venal ones.

This book had been on my \\"to read\\" list for some time, but it moved to the top of the list after a co-worker, a rabid right-winger, read it and then fulminated against the notion that the U.S. could ever become a socialist state. The First Amendment doesn't protect anti-Americanism, he said, and the book should be banned and the author arrested. Actually, I believe he would have been quite comfortable in the authoritarian future America in which Zhong Shan Zhang lives and works. \\"Zhong Shan\\" translates to \\"China Mountain,\\" but it's also the Mandarin version of the Cantonese name \\"Sun Yat Sen.\\" It's like an American being named \\"George Washington Jones.\\" Zhang is an ABC -- an American-born Chinese -- who gets by, barely, as a Construction Tech in New York. More important, he's only half-Chinese; his mother was Hispanic, but his genetic inheritance from his Chinese father was enhanced by gene-splicing. Since all the best jobs and top corporate positions go to Chinese (the most racist people in the world), every little bit helps. But even more important than his problematical background, Zhang is set apart by being gay -- in a world in which deviance is dealt with by exile to the Mars colony or by a bullet in the back of the head. The plot line is really pretty simple: Zhang loses his job after his boss tries to fix him up with his extremely ugly daughter (who doesn't know about his sexual orientation), he takes a job in semi-desperation as the only Construction Tech at a research station above the Arctic Circle (where he learns to value the dawn after five months of darkness), he parlays his hardship assignment into admission to Nanjing University to study engineering (where he finally begins to flower as a Daoist engineer/architect), and he returns to New York in search of long-delayed professional success and personal fulfillment. It's the richness of the author's portrayal of a possible, quite believable future that make this book so fascinating: The details of kite-racing, the fundamental differences between Chinese and Western attitudes (McHugh studied for some time in the PRC), the mix of very high-tech and very low, the internal politics of a commune on Mars, and the sheer prosaic-ness of people just trying to get by, to survive in a largely uncaring world. Zhang is a fully realized character, but so are his friends and acquaintances. And so are the other major characters in New York and on Mars, all of whose stories gradually come together late in the book. This is a beautiful piece of writing.e-racing, the fundamental differences between Chinese and Western attitudes (McHugh studied for some time in the PRC), the mix of very high-tech and very low, the internal politics of a commune on Mars, and the sheer prosaic-ness of people just trying to get by, to survive in a largely uncaring world.

As Moody says, it was a very, very different time -- so different I doubt anyone under thirty-five can even imagine it. No call waiting, no cable TV, no AIDS or HIV, no laser printers, no CDs, no Reagan Revolution. The names Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin still meant something. We knew who Rose Mary Woods was, too. But still, New Canaan, Connecticut, was a very different place from north Texas. That fall, Benjamin Hood and his wife, Elena, took the final step toward the break-up of their shaky, unhappy marriage. Wendy Hood, age fourteen, was becoming known as a slut, though she wasn't a bad kid and it wasn't entirely her fault. Her brother, Paul, wasn't having much fun as a seventeen-year-old preppie, either. It was the year the key party came to the upscale suburbs. None of the characters in this painful-to-read novel are particularly likable. You might feel sorry for them, at least some of the time, but you wouldn't particularly want to spend time with any of them, or at least I wouldn't. But Moody keeps you reading, wondering how they're going to screw themselves up next. Making an engrossing story out of unpleasant people and distasteful situations isn't easy, but he manages it.	2004-09-07

Except perhaps for _Citizen of the Galaxy,_ this is Heinlein's best juvenile, and one of his best novels of any sort. Rod Walker is in high school, preparing himself for some kind of career in the Outlands -- the newly-discovered, newly-settled worlds now so close at hand through hyperspace gates. That means a bare-hands survival course with a final exam in which the class is dumped on an empty planet to survive however for a week or so. But something goes wrong with the gates, and nearly a hundred high school and college students are stranded on their test-world, perhaps forever. Setting up a new society, virtually a new civilization, won't be easy, but it gives Heinlein the opportunity to show the reader how *he* thinks it ought to be done. This is well-written, thoughtful adventure and the author avoids (for the most part) the syrupy overwriting of which he was often guilty in his later work. The portrait of Rod learning to cope, finding himself, and discovering what makes him happy, is very, very well done.	2004-09-05

The person most being done to here is forty-three-year-old John Tollefson, refugee from Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, running an NPR station in a college town in upstate New York. He's an intelligent, quiet, reflective guy, trying to be a Happy Lutheran even though he has dark opinions about talk radio. He falls in love with Alida, a history professor at Columbia, and they see each other one weekend a month, which maybe is preferable to marriage. He has an idea for a \\"garden restaurant,\\" which ends up a money pit, thanks to the mismanagement of his lawyer, Alida's brother, and the chicanery of an ex-hippie contractor. But, as in most of Keillor's writing,  the plot is the least part of the book. The best part is always the telling of tales about family and friends by everyone in the little town, the spinning of yarns about ancestors, the sometimes dark but generally tolerant and amused interweavings of personalities at the Chatterbox Cafe and the Sidetrack Tap. The author himself, of course, is in many ways very much like the characters he portrays, relating the adventures of John's great-uncle, the snake-oil medicine man who served four terms in Congress, and his Aunt Mildred, who flim-flammed the bank where she was a teller and decamped to Buenos Aires, and his own adolescent adventures tipping privies and trying to pick up girls at the roller rink. The set piece is John's coming home for his father's funeral, the gathering of the clan, the service itself, led by his pastor brother-in-law, and the drunken wake at the Sidetrack afterward. As we discover, there are just as many oddballs per family in Lake Wobegon as anywhere else, probably more, and Keillor paints them vividly in more than three dimensions. This is the sort of book that could never be made into a film, but which you will drive your spouse crazy reading aloud passages from.	2004-09-03

I started reading Heinlein's juveniles in the mid-1950s, when he was still producing them. I have read enormous amounts of science fiction ever since, but I still go back and re-read one of his adolescent adventure yarns now and then. They're good for what ails you. Some, admittedly, are overwritten and too sweet, but this story of a very bright girl in her early teens and her younger, brilliant brother is actually pretty well done. Podkayne is a native of Mars, the descendant of intellectuals and others shipped off to a prison colony for their political opinions, on the Australian model. Her mother's an engineer, her father's a historian, and her Uncle Tom is a hero of the Revolution and a Senator-at-Large of the Martian Republic. Uncle is going (very quietly) to a triplanetary conference on Luna, by way of Venus, and Poddy and her brother, Clark, are along for the ride -- and to provide protective coloration, though they don't realize it at first. She learns how to manipulate the younger officers on the star-liner, Clark smuggles aboard a bomb (we're never quite sure why), and nefarious doings are afoot by the political opposition. Heinlein had a knack for projecting likely technical advances of the future (even though Clark still carries a slide rule), but his grip on social change is far less sure. In her attitudes, and those of society, it's as though the Feminist 1960s and '70s never happened. And Poddy at (I think) fifteen is much less sophisticated than the average American twelve-year-old today. Ah, well. Heinlein was incapable of writing anything, even a kid's novel, without including his own social and political opinions, but they're less obtrusive here than in some of his other books. For that matter, Heinlein actually was an ethical and social relativist who loved to contradict himself from book to book, so don't be too sure you know what he actually thought!	2004-09-01

He's inventive and witty and a master of the English sentence. But his actual novels don't always work, and this one is less successful than most. Homicide detective Mike Hoolihan is a world-weary female city cop somewhere in (I think) the American Midwest. She's a recovering alcoholic, she was abused by her father, and she has lousy taste in men. She would also do anything for Colonel Tom Rockwell, her mentor and ex-boss, now high brass in the department. And when Colonel Tom's daughter, the beautiful and brainy Jennifer Rockwell, apparently shoots herself in the head (three times), she has to carry the news to the unbelieving father. And then she has to investigate the incident at his behest to make sure it really was a suicide. Mike talks like a parody of the streets but she's an intelligent and experienced, though somewhat bigoted cop (as they all are, she says), and her inquiries lead her only to the reasons Jennifer might have killed herself. Except Amis never quite makes this clear, and the last couple pages rather baffled me. Maybe I missed something here -- but I really don't thing so. But there's one other major problem with this book, a very jarring problem, something that keeps me from enjoying it as much as I believe I would have. How can someone with Amis's gift for language, someone whose father was an expert in English usage, be so totally unaware of American idiom? The very opening line is \\"I am a police,\\" which he seems to think is a common construction in this country. This continues throughout the book and it throws me every time I see it. Then there's the use of purely Brit terms like \\"semi-detached house,\\" which few Yanks comprehend, even those who read British mysteries. And there's that whole thing of referring to the police department as the \\"CID.\\" Isn't that also a British thing? I've never heard the usage in this country. And Mike mentions a city cop who \\"took a bullet for the State.\\" No, he didn't, because the U.S., unlike the UK, does not have a unitary governmental system. He took a bullet \\"for the city\\" -- except I can't imagine any cop would think like that. And there are lines like \\"The science crew come and go.\\" Does he really not know that in American English collective nouns are considered singular? (I assume \\"science crew\\" refers to the forensics team, and I've never heard that term either, but who knows?) I've read that he was somehow running a riff on American society, but if so, he's awfully vague about it. My puzzlement about the resolution (or not) of the plot aside, this short novel would have been far better had the author set it in London or Manchester.because the U.S., unlike the UK, does not have a unitary governmental system.

I recently ran across a paperback copy in a used-book store, remembered how much I had enjoyed it (though I had forgotten most of the details), and picked it up for a re-read. And I'm glad I did. Grimwood (now deceased) wrote a few other novels dealing with time-traveling and ultra-long-livedness, but none of them enjoyed anything close to the success of this one, and that's a shame. The \\"what if\\" premise is very simple: What if death, for a very few of us, isn't permanent? What if you get to try again? Jeff Winston is in his forties, the news director of a small Florida television station, stuck in an unhappy marriage. And one day, while on the phone to his wife, he falls face-down on his desk, dead of a massive heart attack. And then wakes up, confused and extremely disoriented, to find himself back in his eighteen-year-old body at Emory in 1963, but with his full adult memory. He has a journalist's grasp of the public history of his own lifetime, including the winners of major sporting events, and a couple of shrewd bets on the Kentucky Derby and the World Series sets him up for life. Knowing what the social and technological trends are going to be, he makes all the right investments. The one thing he can't do, though, is relate to the people he used to know as though he were still eighteen, and that includes the girl with whom he was in love at the time, and the young woman who later became his wife. Worst of all, when he reaches that fatal day in 1988, he dies on schedule -- and has to start all over again. What's the point? Why bother trying to accomplish anything? The author examines all the aspects of this unique sort of futility, which becomes almost a Kubler-Ross \\"stages of acceptance\\" process. And then Jeff's situation changes. He's not the only \\"replayer.\\" Grimwood has an excellent grasp on events and trends of the 1960s and `70s and how they might be taken advantage of with foreknowledge, which I found particularly fascinating because the main character and I are within two months of being the same age.

I, on the other hand, have been known to temporarily absent myself from a family barbecue and go out to the car so I can turn on NPR and catch the latest News from Lake Woebegon. He is without doubt the most hypnotic storyteller in America today. But if your only exposure to his stuff is Prairie Home Companion, if you've never read his novels, then you don't know that Keillor also has a salty side. My personal favorite is still WLT: A Radio Romance, but this latest offering ranks high on the list. Larry Wyler of St. Paul (Keillor's hometown and his Everytown) has an English degree and the ambition of being published in The New Yorker and living the Good Life. Iris, the love of his life even when they're semi-separated for years, is a no-nonsense do-gooder who doesn't approve of conspicuous consumption. Larry tries hard to come up with the Great Midwestern Novel, but his writing is just too self-conscious and mannered. Finally, spurred by How to Write Your Novel in Thirty Days (we've all read books like that), he cranks out an action-adventure potboiler, sells it within weeks for a big advance, and hits the best seller lists. His ship has come in. He's in demand on radio and television. People line up for his autograph. His publisher advances him a quarter-million for his next book. And all Larry can think about is escaping St. Paul and moving to New York for an office at 25 West 43rd Street, the Mecca of all serious American writers. Of course, his move is spurred also by Iris's discovery of his two almost casual infidelities. And Iris has no interest in New York, so off he goes. He becomes sailing buddies with Bill Shawn, Salinger drops by to chat (in between appearances on TV game shows), Updike tells him about the pistol in his desk drawer, Kael takes him to the movies (and brings her own popcorn). And Larry can't write another damn thing. Blocked like an ailing colon. In desperation, and because he needs the income, he takes on a twice-weekly advice column, \\"Ask Mr. Blue,\\" for the Minneapolis newspaper, which he delivers by email while remaining in his tiny New York apartment. But that's the only bright spot in his life now. His second novel is a pretentious bomb, immediately remaindered (Barnes & Noble removes the security tags so as not to discourage shoplifters), the only good thing he writes gets left on a train, and he's drinking and gaining weight. But things will brighten up eventually -- sort of. To me, the strongest part of the book is the resilient relationship between Larry and Iris, their crowd of odd friends, and the behind-the-scenes look at the New Yorker staff (to look at them, you'd never know they were all Sicilian and that the publisher was a Mafioso). The letters Mr. Blue receives and Larry's replies -- his only writing that seems to come easy -- go a bit over the top, I think, though they also serve as markers in his own life. And I would have left off the Epilogue entirely; it's way too much of a downer and threatens to spoil the essentially hopeful thrust of the rest of the book. Still, Keillor is mostly successful, as he mostly always is, and I shall be looking forward to his next.e he needs the income, he takes on a twice-weekly advice column, \\"Ask Mr. Blue,\\" for the Minneapolis newspaper, which he delivers by email while remaining in his tiny New York apartment.

This is her very first, written as an undergrad and published just as she was starting graduate work at Columbia and working at Downtown Brentano's. I was also in grad school and I read it avidly the same year. She chose for her first excursion one of the key events in Western European history (and therefore in our own history on this side of the Atlantic): The last phase of the rise of William of Normandy as a charismatic figure of major influence and the decisive day of battle near Hastings that completely changed the course of everything having to do with England. But that's only the final few chapters. We start with the journey of Laeghaire (pronounced \\"Lear\\") of the Long Road, an Irish knight with Viking ancestors (making him kin to William himself), a berserker fighter who builds a reputation to silence those beside whom he fights. Laeghaire has fought for pay all over Europe for nine years and now, fleeing the vengeance of a stingy Thuringian lord, he heads back to the court of the Count of Flanders, Duke William's father-in-law. He leads the Flemish contingent in the Norman conquest of Maine, where he comes to William's notice in both good and bad ways. The Irishman is touchy of his honor and reputation, a free knight who doesn't take orders easily, an intelligent and literate man with a gift for languages who is uncommonly useful to his employer. He acquires a woman, and a son, and begins to care about someone other than himself, until Hastings comes and reorders his life yet again. Laeghaire would not be an easy man to be around, but he's certainly a man you would want to be sure was on your side. All the elements of Holland's very personal approach to medieval military history are here -- the lesser figure as viewpoint who mixes with the great and powerful, the use of vivid colloquial English so carefully crafted you'll think you're eavesdropping on the original vernacular, the spare prose that doesn't describe every tree and field but that points up the occasional crucial detail as a key to mood and character. The author also relies on short, simple declarative sentences -- a style which was somewhat overdone in this first book but which was modified in her subsequent work. With all the reading I do of new releases, I manage always to salt my list with re-reads of Holland's best half-dozen novels every few years, as a matter of balance.inal vernacular, the spare prose that doesn't describe every tree and field but that points up the occasional crucial detail as a key to mood and character.

It's long out of print, but I hunted until I found a copy -- and I know now, again, why I remembered it so well. Lynn is known mostly for her high-concept fantasy, but this one is \\"what if\\" science fiction of the best sort. It's sometime in the unknown future and humans have colonized dozens of worlds, aided by the discovery of the \\"Hype\\" -- a parallel hyperspace route between stars, navigated by starcaptains, latter-day bravos with their own traditions and culture. The four worlds of the Sardonyx Sector got together a few generations ago to set up a prison world called Chabad, not unlike Britain shipping off its felons to Australia. But now Chabad is a colony world, too, with its own exports, and nearly everything is powered by the slave labor of the convicts. Lynn is careful to make her version of slavery as humane as possible: After their sentence is up, slaves are freed, their property is returned to them, and they can either leave Chabad or become free citizens. They're depersonalized, but not tortured. If they have useful skills, and if their owners are sensitive people, they may experience something like contentment. But they aren't free. And many, perhaps most, slaves are kept dosed on a tranquilizing euphoric drug called dorazine to keep them controllable. Of the Four Families that run Chabad, the slave system is in the care of Family Yago, and especially of Domna Rhani Yago, head of the family, and her brother, Zed, who is both a Senior Medic and Commander of the \\"Net,\\" the toroidal starship that collects the prisoners from the other worlds of the sector and brings them to the slave auction on Chabad. Add an interplanetary antidrug police force trying to keep dorazine from being brought to Chabad, and all the elements are present for a complex, involving plot. But the real focus is on the personalities of Rhani, a reasonable, fair-minded woman who has been blinded by her upbringing and position, and of Zed, a sexual psychopath and thoroughgoing, self-aware sadist. And, finally, of Dana Ikoro, young starcaptain trying to bring off his first successful dorazine smuggling run, who gets caught and falls afoul of Zed before becoming Rhani Yago's slave-pilot -- and confidant, and lover. And there are more than a dozen other carefully-drawn characters in the supporting cast, all of which makes this a thoroughly fascinating book. I've read other reviews by readers -- probably much younger ones -- that have been knee-jerk dismissive of this novel because it seems to approve of slavery, . . . which it doesn't. Lynn seeks only to examine the possible effects of its use, which she does very effectively. Those other reviewers seem to adhere to absolutist standards of ethics and morality and seem not to understand that history (even when it's future history) is what happens, not what *should* happen. Both attitudes are foolish. But then, most long-time science fiction readers learn early to become tolerant ethical relativists.been blinded by her upbringing and position, and of Zed, a sexual psychopath and thoroughgoing, self-aware sadist.

I was just out of graduate school and working in my first professional position when the first Star Wars movie (now known as \\"Episode 4\\") came out. I loved it. I had been a confirmed pulp-sf addict since the mid-1950s, and I was predisposed to enjoy the film for what it was, not for what the critics thought it was (and what they apparently wanted me, as a card-carrying intellectual, to believe it was). But I'm not too proud to admit that I also loved \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" when they came out. I mean, this stuff is great fun, right? The stuffier film critics, though, decided that George Lucas had killed the movies -- just as there were cries of anguish back in the late '20s, when the movies began to talk. Yes, the Star Wars universe has had a great influence on culture, and not just \\"pop\\" culture, but so have Gucci and Ronald Reagan and McDonald's. Most of the contributors to this anthology are of an age to have grown up on Star Wars, and the distinction can easily be made between those who don't take it, or themselves, too seriously (Jonathem Lethem, Neal Pollack, Erika Krouse, and Elwood Reed), and those for whom Lucas is Evil incarnate (notably Arion Berger and Tom Carson). The book is an interesting read for those, like me, with an interest in film-making and screenwriting that goes beyond just sitting there with a bag of popcorn, but I could only shake my head at some of the breast-beating Jeremiads.	2004-08-10

But I've been a freelance copyeditor for a couple of decades, so I'm entitled. I fell in love with Garner's _Dictionary of Modern American Usage_ when it appeared in 1998, and the present volume is mostly a (renamed) complete revision and updating of that. He also wrote the standard \\"Grammar and Usage\\" chapter for the 15th edition of _The Chicago Manual of Style_, and a number of books on legal style and writing, so he's certainly qualified. Perhaps more important, his own writing style is crystal-clear, conveying exactly what the reader needs to know in making writing choices. (I met him once in Dallas, and I have to say he speaks as clearly and judiciously as he writes.) Some of the entries are very timely (\\"Ground Zero\\"), while some of the mis-usage problems he identifies have been around for some time and probably aren't going away soon (\\"cohort\\" and \\"decimate\\"). Some, I didn't realize *were* problems, like the plural (or not) of \\"gyros\\" and the proper designation for residents of Hawaii, but having read the entries, I shall remember them in future. And for some issues, Garner calls out the big guns, such as the struggle to make people use apostrophes properly. (Apostrophizing a plural should be a felony, especially when it appears on a public sign or in a newspaper!) There are very few gaps in the coverage, so up-to-date is he. Though I did note that in the discussion of the ellipsis, attention is given only to its use to indicate an omission in a quotation -- not to the equally valid use to indicate a pause in narrative or dialogue, . . . which, after all, is probably its principal nonacademic usage. But any serious writer or editor will want a copy of this volume on his Ready Reference shelf.	2004-08-10

But then, in this author's world of the university campus, almost everything comes in twos -- interdisciplinary anthropologist Philip Engstand and particle physicist Alice Coombs, with whom he is deeply in love; the black-and-white blind men, Evan and Garth; competitive academics Soft, the resident Nobel laureate, and Braxia, the visiting Italian physicist; outside temptors Cynthia Jalter, a specialist in dual cognitive systems and obsessive coupling, and the Lack -- with whom (or which) almost everyone wants to pair up. Especially Alice, who has transferred her love away from Philip. But Lack, created in one of Soft's experiments, is defined only by his choices of what objects to accept in his field. Argyle socks and light bulbs, yes; bow ties and scrambled duck's eggs, no. This sounds confusing (as most of Lethem's novels do when you attempt to describe them), but he has the knack of leading the reader neatly through the most bizarre settings and action while strewing the path with quirky, witty dialogue and sneakily astute observations. Each of his books is different from all the earlier ones, and each is difinitely worth the time-investment.	2004-08-07

Hitch, like many of us, is a mixture of idealism about people in general and cynicism about actual individuals. He's still friends (and occasional bed-partner) with his ex-wife, a very free artisitc spirit. He keeps getting caught up in slightly bizarre Little Theatre productions, much against his better judgment. He's a bemused regular at the Screaming Oyster Saloon, run by his ex-in-laws. And in this first installment, he loses his heart to a female police detective who's had a very poor life and now is in very big trouble and considerable danger. Most of Cockey's characters, especially Hitch and his closest friends and associates, as well as the assorted political miscreants, ring true. Kate the cop doesn't, however, not quite. (I have to wonder about the Baltimore PD's psychological screening program.) It takes a little while before the plot begins to assert itself -- fair enough, the author has to establish all those new characters first -- but when the murders and misdeeds begin to pile up, you'll find yourself thoroughly engrossed.	2004-08-04

Thirteen-year-old Pella Marsh, just edging over the cusp into womanhood, is the oldest of three children of Clement and Caitlin -- the former a failed politician in a post-enviro-catastrophic America, the latter now dead of cancer. They've transplanted themselves to the over-bioengineered World of the Archbuilders in order to escape Earth, but our world's most basic interpersonal problems have accompanied them. The Archbuilders -- those few who remain after the great bulk of them went off into deep space -- are quiet, gentle, curious polylinguists whom the humans don't really understand and probably never will. There are only a handful of other families in their little town-without-a-name: The Kincaids, with a son Pella's age, the drunken Grants with their two socially warped offspring, a lesbian couple with a baby, and a few bachelors. But one of those is Efram Nugent, the personification of violent inadaptability whom Pella sees as part of the rock of the new planet, almost an undeniable force of nature, and whom she alternates between fearing, loathing, and idolizing. Perhaps it's really the Planet of Efram. And he's far more adaptable than anyone could know, because he, like Pella, declines to take the drug that keeps him from inhabiting the \\"household deer\\" in his sleep and speeding and spying across the valleys, witnessing all the personal human things that no one else should see. There's a certain titillating Nabokovian flavor here (though without his humor) but don't let that distract you. The story is mostly a bleak but moving look at human inability to be anything other than human, regardless of the landscape.	2004-07-29

It was the perfect choice, but my companion didn't think so; I kept interrupting her own reading to share choice passages, whether she wanted to hear them or not. It's just that kind of book, if you're the sort of reader who loves original and creative use of the language. Bostonian Arno Strine, reader, writer, and all-round intellectual, has made a career for himself as an office temp, simply because there are more important things in his life: Namely, the ability to drop out of time, to stop the world and get off, to escape the noise and bustle for the silence and solitude of the Fold. When the power is on him, he can cause the entire universe to come to a halt (via various mechanical and psychological mechanisms that vary over time), allowing him to go where he likes and do what he likes with no one the wiser. But Arno, being Arno, rather than using this ability to become wealthy, or snoop into international secrets, or wield unlimited social or political power,  mostly just takes women's clothes off, and hides in their clothes hampers while they bathe, and writes personalized erotica (or \\"rot\\") for them to discover when time restarts. He's had plenty of \\"normal\\" relationships with women, but his one attempt to tell a woman about his activities outside of time was not a success. However, the story line is just Baker's excuse to indulge himself in highly creative (and often pornographic) flights of fancy in Arno's voice, who seems almost incapable of sticking to his subject. But there are plenty of quotable lines here, like \\"Each woman inspires her own fetishes\\" (which is very true when you think about it), and \\"Temps are prima facie alienated by virtue of their vocational rootlessness.\\" Arno is also extremely analytical, not only of himself but of everything around him, including the impact of masturbation on carpal tunnel syndrome, social interaction between temps and full-time workers, the sexual impact of removing one's wristwatch in public, and the rotational capabilities of various types of centrifuge. Even his fantasy life is extremely detailed. At base, Baker is a hoot and you can't take him too seriously -- but on the other hand, probably you should. As in all his work, you know for sure he's paying attention to what's really going on.carpal tunnel syndrome, social interaction between temps and full-time workers, the sexual impact of removing one's wristwatch in public, and the rotational capabilities of various types of centrifuge.

This is her sixth, and still one of her best. As usual in her earlier work, Holland shows you great and dramatic events through the eyes of a minor figure. This time, the drama is the late stages of the civil war in England (c.1150) between Stephen of Blois (who had himself anointed king by his brother, the Bishop of Winchester) and Henry Plantagenet, son of the Empress Maud (who was the daughter of King Henry I and had been designated his successor). The viewpoint-character is Fulk de Bruyere, Earl of Stafford -- an Honour which didn't exist at this time, but easily could have. Fulk is a very intelligent, complex, shrewd man who worries about his sons, sometimes acts impulsively, is able to laugh at himself, and is quite aware of his own failings. Prince Henry, very learned at a young age, is also very full of himself but his blazing charisma and psychological subtlety overshadow most of the warrior aristocracy. The earls of Chester, Pembroke, and Leicester (especially) are very individual in style and personality, and so is Fulk's son and heir, Rannulf. Only Fulk's outlawed uncle, Thierry Ironhand, never quite comes completely alive for me, perhaps because we only see him through Fulk's eyes -- and Fulk hates him. Holland does great battle scenes, especially on a small scale, which are noted for their bottom-up viewpoint and understated verisimilitude, but her real joy is the convolutions of medieval politics, of which she displays a very sure grasp. (A taste I share, which is partly why I like her stuff so much.)<br /><br />Holland is known for her spare, unadorned, incisive narrative style, filled with physical, emotional, and intellectual tension. Her unblinking grasp of the often harsh details of life in the distant -- or recent -- past is impeccable and her depiction of it is meticulous. She has the knack of showing how even the strangest of strange worlds makes perfect sense to those immersed in it. Her characters always converse in a semi-colloquial English rather than the self-conscious antique style of Sir Walter Scott, giving the reader the impression of listening in on a conversation in the speakers' own vernacular. Only occasionally in this book are you told, subtly, that Fulk and his fellow earls are (of course) speaking French. Every few years, I work my way once more through this author's mostly extraordinary body of work again, and every time I find something new to appreciate.perfect sense to those immersed in it.

I read a lot of fiction, and some of it is almost immediately forgotten, and some of it stays with me for awhile. This book is going to be in the back of my mind for a long, long time. There are three distinct sections, the first set in 1935 at a semi-stately family home in Surrey. Briony Tallis, from whose viewpoint we see things (and frequently misunderstand them), is thirteen and a precocious and overimaginative writer. Her sister, Cecilia, has just finished university and is sort of marking time while she waits for the next stage of her life to begin, whatever it might turn out to be. There's also a brother, Leon, only a couple years older than Cecilia, to whom she is very close. And then there's Cecilia's counterweight: Robbie Turner, the charlady's brilliant son, just down from Cambridge with a first-class degree and Mr. Tallis's assurance that his education will continue to be paid for. Robbie and Cee grew up together, but they're destined not to be pseudo-siblings, thanks to a broken heirloom vase and a fountain. But there are also the young cousins from an about-to-be-broken home, and a budding chocolate magnate visiting in the company of Leon, and what happens in the interval between one morning and the next will ruin two lives and cause radical change in several others. And Briony will be mostly to blame. This first act builds slowly and the characters reveal themselves bit by bit until you know them inside and out. The second section jumps ahead five years to the British army's retreat before the Germans in France and its convergence on Dunkirk. Robbie, a private soldier (because he has no choice), is stumbling through it himself in the company of two corporals and, even though you know what will happen in the larger picture, the suspense of wondering whether Robbie will make it out is excruciating. McEwan does an amazing job of recreating the insanity and chaos of that rout, seen close-up. What keeps him going is the thought of a return to prison and never seeing Cecilia again, and the reader can feel his agony clearly. In the third section, Briony, now eighteen, is a probationer nurse in a London hospital preparing to receive the army's thousands of wounded as they return across the Channel -- and again, McEwan's depiction of the girl's attempt to atone for the pain she has caused, her weariness both in body and in mind, is overwhelming. Even though you know what she has done, you can't help but feel sorry for her. Finally, in a brief coda set in 1999, Briony, now an elderly and accomplished author, has just finished the book we've been reading; it's her truthful account -- maybe -- of what actually happened that summer night in 1935. It's her final act of atonement. And she lets us know in only a few sentences that maybe the lovers weren't actually reunited as she has described. And that would be heartbreaking, but there often is no happy ending in a McEwan novel. Throughout the book, the authors -- both Ian McEwan and Briony Tallis -- weave a web of description and gradual understanding that keep the reader's attention riveted. Many times, I found myself rereading paragraphs aloud just to hear the shape of the prose. An outstanding piece of work.ver seeing Cecilia again, and the reader can feel his agony clearly.

Finally, in a brief coda set in 1999, Briony, now an elderly and accomplished author, has just finished the book we've been reading; it's her truthful account -- maybe -- of what actually happened that summer night in 1935. It's her final act of atonement. And she lets us know in only a few sentences that maybe the lovers weren't actually reunited as she has described. And that would be heartbreaking, but there often is no happy ending in a McEwan novel. Throughout the book, the authors -- both Ian McEwan and Briony Tallis -- weave a web of description and gradual understanding that keep the reader's attention riveted. Many times, I found myself rereading paragraphs aloud just to hear the shape of the prose. An outstanding piece of work.	2004-07-12

It's a horrible thought, but &quot;cyberpunk&quot; is getting a bit long in the tooth, for all that Gibson and Sterling and Stephenson keep writing great books. In his first novel, _Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom,_ Doctorow (who is no relation to E.L. that I know of . . .) showed that he was well on the way to reinvigorating that subgenre. This time, he turns his attention again to the very near future, to a world where the personal computer, the Internet, and the cell phone have all come together in the &quot;comm&quot; -- the ultimate communication, information, and security appliance. The society constructed around the comm, though, is much more difficult to describe. A &quot;tribe&quot; is less than a nation (in the traditional geographic sense) but much more than an affinity group, a societal segment of like-minded people pursuing common ends -- more or less. And because of the inescapable circadian rhythms of our lives, these groups become defined by the time zones in which they primarily reside, even though they're all linked instantaneously by their comms. Art Berry, a loyal member of the tribe based on the U.S. east coast (though it extends all the way to his hometown of Toronto), is a talented user-experience consultant who spends his time and talents in the laborious search &quot;to find the obvious way to do things.&quot; But beyond that, he's also a secret agent of the ESTribe working for (and undermining) a conglomerate in the UK. He has a friend and business partner who is also his handler, and he has a semi-flaky girlfriend from L.A. whom he ought not to trust. Actually, I'll stop there since it appears that an adequate description of this very readable, very fun book would require a review longer than the original text. And you can even download it (and all Doctorow's other work) from the author's website!	2004-07-02

I'm one of the former and while most layout programs seem perfectly intuitive to me, I've had to struggle to make sense of the last few versions of Photoshop. Thomas is a photographer (rather than a printer) but he seems to be entirely a self-taught techie, as am I; he's obviously old enough to have learned his photography long before there were personal computers. He had to work at this stuff to figure things out, and he's pretty good at passing on the results of that learning process to the reader. There's only a brief introduction on the theoretical basics -- pixels and equipment choices, bitmaps vs. vectors, RGB vs. CYMK, and so on. After that, he sticks pretty much to explaining in plain language what the principal groups of Photoshop tools are for (the names Adobe gives them are not always intuitive), how to carry out basic processes (like masking and selecting), and how to avoid making dreadful mistakes. The section on the Pen Tool is less well done, though, because he demonstrates how a Bezier system works without ever explaining *why* it works; he seems to think just experimenting with it will be sufficient. And maybe he's right. His discussion of layers and channels, though, is quite good. The book is crammed with well-rendered photos, usually shown in various stages of editing and modification. This is not a reference manual, and it's certainly far from being the only Photoshop book you will ever need, but it's an excellent place to start.	2004-07-02

It's Valentine's Day, 1797, and the JESTER sloop under Commander Alan Lewrie is prowling behind the line-of-battle ships as Admiral Jervis seeks to close with the Spanish fleet off Cape St. Vincent. And when Captain Horatio Nelson goes against orders in breaking out to pursue his own instincts against an enemy division, Lewrie gets sucked into the action against his much better judgment. But Nelson's success gets him promoted Rear Admiral and Lewrie, from pure dumb luck combined with a willingness to take a chance when necessary, ends up being made post and is given PROTEUS, a spanking-new frigate -- with a perhaps mystical personality. And that's just about all the naval action you'll find in this ninth in the series, but that's because history has once again caught Lewrie up, in the form of the widespread mutinies at Spithead and the Nore. Lambdin does an excellent job of placing these close-to-revolutionary events in the context of the times: High taxation, soaring prices for consumer goods, industrial revolution and continued low wages for those not involved in it, and an increasingly repressive Tory government. Denied by circumstances the usual privilege of taking a core of favored crewmen from his last command to his new one, he must learn his way around not only a new ship and new responsibilities but an entirely new group of subordinates. And cope with the mutiny when it comes to him. And deal with his wife and family. And cope with the notion of his rapscallion father living next door. Not to mention all those women in his past! I suspect this installment may disappoint those who merely want blood and action and don't care about &quot;real&quot; history, but I enjoyed it a great deal.	2004-06-30

Brown covers much more than simply can-openers and veggie-peelers, though. His topical chapters cover pots and pans, storage containers, small miscellaneous utensils, safety items, &quot;sharp things,&quot; and &quot;small things with plugs,&quot; and perhaps the best way to read the book is to browse from the beginning and then read his descriptions, comments, and opinions on certain items as they come to mind. I'm a regular reader of the consumer tests in COOK'S ILLUSTRATED, too, and I think Brown and Christopher Kimball would agree in many ways on what makes a particular tool useful and what features to look for among the products available. Brown's judgments are admittedly personal but he explains them very clearly. Not everything must be specially purchased, either; he recommends a length of dental floss for cutting slices of soft cheese, and he boils eggs in an electric kettle that automatically turns itself off when it reaches a boil. (Great idea!) The book's page design is also quite nice, with good photos and drawings of the tools he discusses, side discussions and tips highlighted in color, and lots of open space. All his sources appear at the back of the book. I certainly hope he does a revised and updated edition in about five years.	2004-06-30

The dashing and rakehell Lewie is in his early 30s now, has attained the rank of commander, and is beginning to mellow just a little as he gains experience and responsibility -- and children. Admiral Sir John Jervis, one of the most cold-blooded disciplinarians the Royal Navy ever produced but an excellent theatre commander, has been given the responsibility of cutting the French off at the knees in the Mediterranean. But the Coalition is falling apart and Great Britain is becoming isolated, the Austrian army -- supposedly \\"the greatest army in Europe\\" -- has turned out a paper tiger, and the Venetian Republic just can't be bothered to save itself. Jervis has created a small squadron to work the Adriatic, led by Capt. Thomas Charlton and including a second frigate under Capt. Benjamin Rodgers (whom Lewrie knew in the Bahamas). And there's another sloop under an aristocratic little pissant named Fillebrowne who is likely to be a burr under Lewrie's saddle for some time to come. The author takes the opportunity to display the nature of Venetian and Austro-Hungarian decadence (compared to the English Way, at any rate) and to let the reader share his intense, dramatically demonstrated disdain for anything to do with the Balkans and the region's long, long history of ethnic cleansing, religious intolerance, and tendency to torture as a tool of revenge. (Kossovo's prominence in the news didn't begin in the 1990s.) My favorite character in the book, though, is the Hungarian Lieut. Kolodzcy, seconded to the squadron as a translator and political advisor, and who turns out to be quite different from Lewrie's and Rodgers's first impression. This one is talkier than most, except for the horrific scene at the pirate encampment near the end, but I enjoyed the Brits' attempts to deal with the original of Byzantine politics.th the original of Byzantine politics.	2004-06-29

Just as Alan Lewrie has gotten much better at this Royal Navy thing, Lambdin has gotten better and better at writing novels about him. From a feckless 17-year-old midshipman, Lewrie has advanced in this seventh in the series to an experienced, competent commander of his own ship-sloop, . . . though he's sometimes equally feckless. If only he could keep his breeches buttoned, his life would have a lot fewer problems in it. But even with a loving wife and three kids back home, he still finds himself involved, willy-nilly, with the lovely young Phoebe Aretino from the previous installment. He won't keep her, though, which is just as well for him. On the professional front, having been posted off to the Med, Lewrie finds himself participating in a small way in that spectacular victory over the Republican French navy known as the Glorious First of June. Then he's off to join Hood's fleet and to participate in the conquest of Corsica as a colleague of Capt. Horatio Nelson -- and to be caught up in the machinations of Mr. Twigg, the spy from his time in the Far East, as well as Choundas, the French captain and pirate who has good reason to hate him, . . . and of whom Lewrie admits well-justified fear. The author seems to have gotten under control his penchant for over-writing and over-reliance on period slang, and his ability to clearly describe naval actions and ship-handling have progressed from occasionally shaky to considerably above average. But most important, Alan Lewrie, filled with self-doubts and a full realization of his own shortcomings even while he repeatedly proves his courage and his worth to the navy, is a fully realized human being of whom the reader can develop some understanding and about whom one cares -- even when he does something personally stupid.	2004-06-15

Or at least rich. Maybe.	Poynter is the guru of a certain type of self-publishing author: The writer/hustler who is interested, first and foremost, in making money -- lots and lots of money -- not merely in making information available and earning enough back to make the effort worthwhile. I've done a certain amount of self-publishing over the past couple of decades (mostly genealogical research materials and local history), and while I'm always interested in what he has to say, I've frankly never found a lot of useful material here. All the way through, especially in the early chapters where he's trying to hook you (and remember that his background is in marketing), he insists this writing-publishing thing is easy. All you do is get an idea, read everything about it, put it all in a notebook (rather quirkily for a technophile, he seems to believe in first-draft writing on paper), edit it into a new shape, and Presto! You have a new book, and it's gonna make you rich! Or something. Among other problems, he seems to have only a hazy idea of how the acquisitions process generally works in a large library system. Not to mention comments like &quot;library loans may hurt sales of fiction,&quot; and &quot;libraries tend to do most of their ordering around the beginning or end of their fiscal year.&quot; Puh-leez. Then there's this, regarding the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998: &quot;Now, anything printed prior to 1922 is safe.&quot; Say what? (Even Cotton Mather?) He also seems to think book-indexing need involve only the &quot;indexing&quot; feature in Microsoft Word. Finally, on the very last page (before the omnipresent order form, that is), he says it doesn't matter who the publisher is: &quot;Who is the author? Is she a credible person? No one ever asks, 'Who is the publisher'?&quot; Au contraire, Dan, the credibility of the *publisher* can be *very* important, especially in technical books.

Cockerel (Alan Lewrie)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Alan Lewrie meets the French Revolution	Lieutenant Alan Lewrie seems to be getting good at this navy thing. In this sixth in the series, it's January 1793 and four years have passed since Lewrie returned home to his wife and kiddies (three of them now); the matrimonial state, as well as playing the almost-squire, is beginning to wear on him just a bit. The French Revolution is under way, though, and renewed war with a very different sort of France is in the air. Lewrie is called up by the Admiralty (he debates whether to accept for, oh, . . . two minutes), but his enemies see to it that he gets shunted to the Impress Service. But that provides an opportunity to get his own back with his detestable half-brother, Gerald, so it's not all wasted time. Then he gets posted to COCKEREL, a 5th Rate frigate under the hard hand of Capt. Braxton, an ultra-nepotistical near-psychopath who is determined that this last opportunity in his career to make his mark will go absolutely perfectly -- even if he has to flog every member of the crew and bully every officer to do it. Lewrie is between the proverbial rock and hard place, between a micro-managing captain who is impossible to please but whose will he must enforce, and a crew nearing mutiny. But all that, while a very well painted portrait of a ship on its way to disaster, is still only the background for the set-piece of this book, which is the disastrous Allied capture and occupation of, and final rout from, the Royalist Mediterranean city of Toulon -- the victim of divisive party politics back in London. Of course, no matter how much Lewrie might truly love his wife, he still can't keep his breeches zipped. First, there's Lady Emma Hamilton in Naples (and he gets there before Nelson), and then there's the adorable little French whore, Zoe, whom he rescues from death at the hands of the Republicans. But Lewrie's big discovery is just how loud a bang a naval mortar can make. And there's also an encounter on the beach with an artillery colonel named Buonaparte, just to keep things interesting.

Morgan came out of nowhere in 2002 with _Altered Carbon_, the first novel about Takeshi Kovacs, overstressed, dangerously empathic diplomat/soldier trying to stay alive (more or less) four centuries into a future in which the mind lives in a bit of metal housed at the top of the spine and can be re-installed in any convenient &quot;sleeve.&quot; This time out, a disgusted Kovacs is recruited by a deserter from the other side to set up an expedition to check out a major find left by the long-disappeared Martians -- who are the only reason humans are out in space to begin with. It's a quest tale, and a very good one, but the real pleasure, for me, is in the author's masterful portrayal and development of the characters. You don't necessarily have to like Kovacs, and you certainly wouldn't feel comfortable around him, but after two excellent novels, you would probably begin to understand him. There's some great quotable passages here, too, about the nature of war, and government, and loyalty, and the human situation in the universe. If _Broken Angels_ doesn't win the Hugo or the Nebula, or both, there is no justice. But, then, Kovacs knows that already.	2004-06-02

Lieutenant Alan Lewrie is enjoying a few weeks in England, in between the completion of his anti-pirate adventures in the Far East (as recounted in The King's Privateer) and taking up his new assignment in command of the gun ketch ALACRITY as part of the Bahamas Squadron. Such a small vessel doesn't ordinarily rate more than one commissioned officer, but on the Navy's books it's a &quot;sloop,&quot; so Capt. Lewrie finds himself with a first officer, the rather prim but engaging Arthur Ballard, who actually is Lewrie's senior in terms of naval experience but seems to harbor no jealousy about their relationship. (In fact, the two soon become friends as well as trusting colleagues and it's apparent Ballard is destined to become &quot;Bush&quot; to Lewrie's &quot;Hornblower.&quot;) Alan spends much of his time ashore with the Chiswicks in Surrey (the family he helped rescue in _The French Admiral_) and is dismayed to find that Caroline Chiswick, for whom he has a soft spot, is being matched off by her uncle to the swinish heir of the local baronet. Suddenly, Lewrie finds himself doing what he never expected: getting married. And, rather than leave his bride in Plymouth, he allows her to talk him into taking her to Nassau with him. Naval novels set in peacetime sometimes have to go far afield to find an entertaining plot, and Lewrie's domestic adjustments, together with a struggle against another set of pirates (and the corrupt civil and naval officials with whom they are in league) make for an engaging yarn.<br /><br />However: The author seems not to understand the distinction between an exclamation mark properly used in dialog (&quot;Kill them!&quot;) and its thoroughly annoying, rather gushing use in narrative (He killed them!). Though perhaps that's just sloppiness after the initial success of the series. And while he has become quite good at descriptive passages, especially those of the sea around the Bahamas (where he obviously has spent some time sailing himself), he also seems too willing to limit most of his principal characters' conversations to the same period slang, used over and over again. Lewrie is brighter than that.

Many readers, I expect, pick this up expecting pornography. Of course, it's nothing of the kind. Shocking in many ways, yes, but not dirty. Even though Nabokov had a hell of a time getting it published at all. But American society in the early 21st century has become far more straitlaced, more puritanical than even in the mythically more idyllic 1950s, and I suspect this book shocks more readers now than it even did then.<br /><br />Humbert Humbert (the narrator's adopted nom-de-perversion) is perfectly aware of his socially unacceptable sexual appetites. He tries, unsuccessfully, to control his perversion through marriage, attempts to identify its origins in a near love affair at the age of thirteen, calmly describes his series of breakdowns and bouts of insanity. But he so often seems to be the victim himself, it's hard to hate him. Given his predilections, Humbert is terribly naive about children, especially the psychology of adolescent girls, while Lo can be both endearingly innocent and shockingly slutty, \\"swearing at me,\\" he says, \\"in a language that I never dreamed little girls could know, let alone use.\\" But he learns just what he has taken on. \\"A combination of naivete and deception, of charm and vulgarity,... Lolita, when she chose, could be a most exasperating brat.\\" And there follows a description of her mercurial temperament that any parent of teenagers will recognize instantly.<br /><br />Humbert's early adventures are nothing if not varied. His involvement with an Arctic scientific expedition, however, was not a success, if only because there were no desirable young girls to observe. \\"Nymphets do not occur in polar regions.\\" Throughout the book, Nabokov is a master of delightful and witty word-play, delivered in gorgeous style. Then, while searching for a small New England town in which he can hide out to pursue his academic research and writing. But Charlotte Haze, who offers him a rented room, turns out to have a luscious twelve-year-old daughter named Dolores -- Lo, Lola, Dolly,... but always Lolita to him -- and Humbert finds the focus for his unhappy life. He actually marries Charlotte just to gain access to the girl, and a few weeks later the mother is struck and killed by a car shortly after discovering just what it is her new husband is after. Lots of ironies here.<br /><br />The precocious Lolita actually seduces middleaged Humbert as much as the other way around, but for her it's just a lark, a test of her sexuality, a temporary adventure. For him, it's the fulfillment of all his desires. His fantasies are more than fulfilled, but in the process, and especially during their year-long drive around the country, she becomes psychologically warped not only by his physical demands but by his manic possessiveness. And before she's fifteen, Lo has found a way to disappear. Humbert is crushed and spends the next several years searching for her, and for Quilty, the equally perverse playwright whom she allowed to spirit her away. And by the time he has found her again (married and pregnant), and takes bloody revenge on Quilty, Humbert has come to realize just what he has done to his beloved Lolita -- because, he discovers, he truly does love her.<br /><br />Throughout, believe it or not, this is a very funny book. There's this, during their first long journey: \\"I deplore the Mann Act as lending itself to a dreadful pun, the revenge that the Gods of Semantics take against tight-zippered Philistines.\\" Or, in the midst of a long, long list of tourist sites visited, \\"Mission Dolores: good title for book.\\" There are also plenty of purely literary jokes -- to which the college student must pay attention but the ordinary reader need not -- including character-doubling (a parody of the traditional German doppelganger theme), the repeating of minor themes (the house/hotel room number, the dog in the street), and Humbert's playing with his own name (Hum, Humble Humbert, Humbug/Homburg). Even the irony that nearly everyone in the story dies, is funny in a slightly warped sort of way. The opening paragraph of this marvelous novel, by the way, is one of my favorites.

In the past couple of decades, as a result of the computer revolution, the environmental movement, and the shift in the balance of power from urban/rural to suburban, home design has changed at a tremendous pace. Many of the resulting living spaces are innovative, some of fascinating -- and some are shocking. I like the large, open barnlike structures that can be divided up as needed, rather like a ground-level loft, and the idea of &quot;microflats&quot; (only 350 square feet) is an interesting solution to overcrowding (as long as you don't have any kids). But the coffin-like fold-up &quot;living units&quot; are simply weird, and the &quot;house of cars&quot; is a decidedly ugly bit of performance art. Personally, I have no use for a house if I can't imagine how anyone could live in it. On the other hand, the homes in Lesotho, created very inexpensively with walls of empty, wired-together aluminum cans, are an ingenious solution to that country's poverty and housing shortage. Some very interesting notions here, beautifully rendered.	2004-05-19

This fourth novel in the \\"Alan Lewrie\\" series is something of a departure, its heavily political (rather than simply naval) plot dictated by the end of the American Revolution in 1783. Lewrie finds himself back in London on a lieutenant's half-pay, subsisting comfortably (as long as he watches his expenses) and indulging his taste for sex with as many women as he can, of any age or marital status. But he's caught 'en flagrante' by an elderly husband -- once his patron, but no longer -- who wants his blood. Just as he's packing for his escape from the city, timely orders arrive from the Admiralty to report immediately to Plymouth, . . . and he's off on another adventure, this time as junior officer on a semi-secret mission to India and Canton, fighting Malay pirates who are in league with a French-backed privateer. The political leader of the mission, Mr. Twigg, is as bloody-minded a secret agent as you will find, perfectly willing to torture and murder surrendered prisoners to get the information he wants. Definitely not a nice person. And in India, Lewrie meets up again with his father, who had stolen from him, set him up with his supposed half-sister, had him essentially shanghaied into the navy, and then decamped to escape his creditors. But now we get the other side of his father's story and, while Sir Hugo retains nearly all his faults, he certainly becomes a more rounded character. Captain Choundas, on the other hand, is vicious, sexually perverted, and one-hundred-percent evil -- and since he survives the final fight with Lewrie, I would be very surprised if he did not return in future installments, probably as an agent of the French revolutionary government. Not as successful as the previous book, but I'll certainly keep reading -- though I hope the author will reduce his use of exclamation points!!!	2004-05-13

The author defines &quot;cult&quot; novels as those that speak &quot;not only to the reader but for him&quot; -- not a bad description. As a college student in the early 1960s, I was swept up (along with everyone else) by the cult authors of the day, especially Burgess, Tolkien, Heinlein, Kesey, Brautigan, and Vonnegut. (I managed to avoid Castenada and Hesse, I'm relieved to say. . . .) All of them are included among the fifty authors profiled and analyzed in this essay collection, though the author apparently whittled his original list down considerably. While I don't agree with all of his observations -- I think Hunter Thompson has long been vastly overrated, for instance -- he's so often right on the money, I found myself jotting down those titles I hadn't read in decades, plus a few I had missed entirely. For an avid reader who is always looking for other people's thoughtful suggestions of what to read, this is a first-rate volume.	2004-05-13

Alan Lewrie, now an experienced seaman and junior watch-stander despite only a couple of years in the Royal Navy, is a refreshingly Corinthian your rake, dividing his attentions pretty much evenly between increasing his growing competence in his profession and topping every female he can find. Here he parts company from the unpredictable Capt. Treghues and from his friend and mentor, Lt. Railsford. Then he receives, as a reward for bravery and demonstrated abilities, an early appointment as 1st Lieutenant into a small brig commanded by the superannuated Lt. Lilycrop -- one of the most delightful and fully developed supporting characters Lambdin has yet come up with. Of course, Alan later learns his being given such a post was a clerical error, . . . but he manages to keep his job nevertheless. (As a more senior officer later remarks, sheer luck and the ability to land on one's feet is probably as important a factor in naval success as seamanship.) Then comes a galloping but adventure among the Creeks of the West Florida coast -- including Lewrie's temporary acquisition of a lovely young Indian wife. The character of Desmond McGilliveray is based on the real Alexander McGillivray, a Creek-Scot half-breed raised white but still well-connected among the tribes. Lambdin paints him as a superior, rather prim sort, which doesn't really fit with the historical McGillivray's character (with which I am familiar from rersearch on the Panton and Leslie trading companies during that period). Nothing really goes quite right for Our Hero in this volume, but that's the way real life often is. An increasingly enjoyable series.	2004-05-09

This is the second installment in what is developing into quite an enjoyable naval series. In _The King's_ Coat, Alan Lewrie, an illegitimate sixteen-year-old London rakehell, was essentially forced into going to sea in 1779 as a midshipman after being framed by his moneygrubbing father and his two half-siblings. He had a very rocky start in his new career but was beginning to learn his trade and had made a few friends, as well as more than a few enemies. He had also managed to come to the notice of at least two men of note, and well-placed interest was always paramount in advancing one's naval future. And there was the gorgeous young Lucy Beauman in Antiqua to whom he began paying court. Now it's two years since he left England and the rebellion in America is drawing to a close, buoyed by incompetence on the part of the British army and navy. And in the process, Alan finds himself trapped like a rat with Cornwallis at Yorktown. He escapes the disaster, partly through chance, partly through the aid of some Loyalist militia, and partly through his own intelligence and unexpected competence. By the end of the book, his future has improved in several important ways, both professionally and personally, and he has become a harder sort of person than he was at the beginning. And there's a new love interest, whether he wants to think so or not. Lambdin offers a welcome antidote to the rather proper style of Hornblower and even Audrey -- his sailors swear fulsomely, his protagonists can be just as narrowminded as anyone else in their society -- but he certainly knows his naval lore. And just when you're settling in to an adventurous episode, something horrible happens to remind you of just how bloody a true civil war the glorious American Revolution really was.	2004-05-07

Henry Denard is an American ex-pat living with his wife, Frances, in a nice hotel on the Caribbean island of St. Martin. They hang around with friends, eat barbequed chicken, and drink a lot. And every so often, Henry gets paid to kill someone. It's a good living and they're happy. Then Henry messes up an assignment by only wounding the target, which irritates the customer -- a cross-dressing New York wiseguy, whom you may find amusing in the first chapter but who quickly becomes more menacing and a lot scarier. At the same time, \\"Donnie Wicks\\" Balistieri, an elderly capo and the target whom Henry failed to quite kill, has agreed to testify for the feds and is stashed away on the same island with a guard of U.S. marshals. This could be a problem for Henry and Frances. Then there's Mickey and Rachel, more recent escapees from New York (and who are perhaps the main characters from Bourdain's first novel), who live in Donnie's palatial home, and whom Henry hopes can be his conduit to old Donnie. Then there's Paulie the good soldier, and Kevin the hitman who finds love in a bordello, and Monsieur Ribiere, the French cop on the island. It sounds confusing, but the author is very good at laying out the plot clearly, pacing the action properly, and developing the characters in a way that hold your attention. He never lets you forget what these people really are, either. Just when you're smiling at the adolescent sexual antics of the middle-aged Henry and Frances, a bit of violence will remind you of the realities. If Bourdain cooks half as well as he writes, I'll have to make a reservation at his restaurant.	2004-04-29

As a rule, I absolutely hate it when I get halfway into a novel and it suddenly changes into something else. This one starts as a very good police procedural murder mystery -- but at almost exactly the midpoint, the author suddenly *tells* you whodunit, and it becomes a thriller instead. Chicago &quot;Windy&quot; Thomas is an almost excessively competent young woman who has just left her job as a sheriff in Virginia to run the forensics lab in Las Vegas. She's trying to track down a particularly gruesome serial killer who wipes out whole families (except for the fathers) and, of course, she becomes a target herself. She has a cute six-year-old daughter and a control-freak boyfriend, but she's also drawn to Ash Laughton, head of the Metro Violent Crime Unit -- who just happens to also be a computer-software-millionaire. (I'm told there are a lot of similarities between the set-up and a top TV series, but I've never seen it.) Jaffe generally does a good job with the characters, except that I find it hard to believe that Windy was ever able to pass the FBI's personality screens. The pace is breathless, the level of detail is almost clinical, and the ending somewhat redeems the plot giveaway.	2004-04-28

This is a terrific novel for the geek-at-heart, a historical set in the two days in AD 79 just before the explosion of Vesuvius that destroyed several of the towns set like jewels along the Bay of Naples. The protagonist is the young engineer Marcus Attilius Primus, newly appointed 'aquarius', or manager, of the sixty-mile-long Aqua Augusta aqueduct. He's only been on the job a few days when the water supply fails and he has to find and fix the problem or face an inquiry and the probable failure of his career. That means dealing with corrupt local officials -- especially Numerus Popidius Ampliatus, a freed slave who has become the main political power in Pompeii -- and also with Pliny, the great naturalist who is serving as admiral of the Roman fleet harbored at one end of the Bay. He's not getting much cooperation from his own subordinates, either, but they have their own agendas. Of course, we know what caused the buckling that shut off the aquaduct, and we know why the water smells of sulphur, and why the fish in the offshore pens have died, but Harris does an excellent job building the suspense. Will Attilius be able to do his job? Will he survive the plotting of Ampliatus, and get together with his daughter? Will any of them survive the eruption? The plot is a dead run from the first page, the writing is plain and straightforward (no need to invent drama here), and even though we know how it will end, we don't know all the details.	2004-04-21

Tommy Pagana is a young sous-chef in an okay Manhattan restaurant. He likes his work, he hopes he has a future both with his career and with Cheryl the waitress, and he has tried for years to distance himself from his mobster relatives and their friends -- especially his Uncle Salvatore, a mid-level wiseguy who yearns to be &quot;straightened out&quot; by the higher-ups. The restaurant is run by Harvey, a Jewish ex-dentist who's into the local mob for serious money, plus he has another loan from a turf-encroaching bunch from Brooklyn. Only Harvey is also an informant for the FBI, which is trying to stir things up just to see what shakes loose. Then there's Michael the junkie chef, Tommy's friend and boss, who is also put to work by the feds, and there's Al the special agent, who really doesn't care what happens to any of them as long as they bring him something to make a case out of. Then Uncle Sally pushes the reluctant Tommy into allowing him to use the restaurant for a secret meeting -- which turns into a homicide, witnessed by Tommy, . . . who is now also a person of interest to law enforcement. What to do? How to stay both alive and out of prison, yet not have to rat out his uncle, which would break his mother's heart? These hoods aren't Donald Westlake's comic bumblers, either. In fact, their workaday attitude toward what they do, including murder, is what makes them decidedly scary. (The NYPD detectives, on the other hand, hardly come off as Lenny Brisco. . . .) Bourdain has a real ear for the nuances of New York style and conversation, plus a gift for describing life in the kitchen, that make the whole thing ring true. So why hasn't this terrific book been made into a film?	2004-04-16

This novel won the British Library Association's Carnegie Medal in 1967 -- but like all &quot;young adult&quot; fiction of exceptional quality, it's a very good book, period. Teenaged Roger's father, Clive, has recently married Margaret, whose likewise teenaged daughter, Alison, is the legal inheritor of a house in a brooding Welsh valley, where all of them have gone for a summer break. Old Nancy grew up in the valley but left years ago; now she has been persuaded to return to work as housekeeper, and she's brought along her son, Gwynn, who wants only to get away from the world in which he finds himself stuck. And there's Huw Halfbacon, the strange, almost mystical laborer who is much more to the residents of the valley than his English employers could imagine. It all begins when the three young people discover a complete dinner service in the attic decorated with floral owls, and Alison becomes almost possessed by them. And Roger discovers a streamside stone with a hole bored clear through it, which he is told was made by a anciently thrown spear that killed the man standing behind the stone. It all has to do with stories from the Mabinogion, with traditions that insist on being followed, and with the inescapable patterns of life. And the ending is not what you might expect!	2004-04-16

I've been a Le Carre fan for several decades and I was a little concerned, back in the early '90s, that the end of the Cold War and the Soviet Union would leave him nothing to write about. As has been obvious to everyone since then, I needn't have worried. Politics may change but people and their untrustworthy interrelationships don't. This time, though, there's a very specific, very contemporary focus to the events the author considers, from the radical student underground in West Germany in the '60s to the ill-considered U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- an event about which the author's own opinions are in no doubt whatever. Ted Mundy, expatriate Brit in occupied West Berlin in his youth, later recruited by Her Majesty's Secret Service to spy on the East Germans, is a professional liar, like many of the protagonists of Le Carre's recent novels. His closest friend, Sasha, is an \\"expatriate\\" East German, also in West Berlin, recruited by the Soviets to spy on the West -- but also, after he discovered just what his masters were capable of, a double agent for the British, through Mundy. But in all important ways, Sasha is a unflinching truth-teller, and that's his eventual downfall -- and Mundy's. As always, half the enjoyment of a Le Carre novel is in the convolutions of character development and in his unfailingly impressive use of the English language. In that sense, the plot almost doesn't matter. But as events roll on toward the present day, you can almost guess -- almost -- what Mundy's and Sasha's joint reaction will be, based on the way their lives have developed. Personally, I think Le Carre probably will never be able to duplicate the absolutely masterful Smiley series, but no book he's written has ever been less than excellent, and _Absolute Friends_ is proof of that.	2004-03-31

Before the war, Burma ran the Fiat Lux detective agency in Paris and his investigative skills are needed again in finding the origin and identity of an amnesiac fellow prisoner -- and also the killer of an old friend and associate murdered before his eyes at a railway station. The cast of characters includes journalists, cops, lawyers, and crooks -- both big-time and two-bit. The German occupation is always in the background but it's not really part of the story. Rather, this is a classic &quot;noir&quot; murder mystery, complete with a wrap-up scene where everyone involved comes together to hear the detective explain the clues and identify the murderer. This is a sort of minimalist approach to the graphic novel form: Straight story-telling in black-and-white, each bit in its own rectangular frame, emphasis on the words rather than artsy effects. And it's an excellent piece of work.	2004-03-31

Actually, it begins about five minutes after the end of that book, with Rincewind, the incapable wizard falling through space after having tumbled over the edge of the world. But the spell lodged in his head saves him (as well as Twoflower the tourist) in order to save itself, and Rinceworld is launched unwillingly in an effort to save the world. Great A'Tuin, the celestial turtle on the back of which the Discworld glides slowly through the universe, is headed toward a distant, very red star which will probably bring all Disc life to an end. But it has its reasons. As always, Pratchett introduces a number of new and quite delightful characters, especially Cohen the Barbarian, the greatest hero in history -- as evidenced by his very advanced age. With all that, though, I just couldn't get as caught up in this one as in MORT or SMALL GODS. But even a B-minus novel from Pratchett is better than the best many humorists ever produce!	2004-03-09

I remember reading the first edition of this excellent book more than a decade ago, when I was just getting into desktop publishing, and learning a great deal from it on the theory (i.e., art) and proper use of typography. I've followed the author's advice (most of it, anyway) ever since and I was pleased to find that a revised edition had been issued. Spiekermann is a type designer as well as a philosopher of art and design, and he's an excellent teacher as well. He nicely combines witty discursions on the place of type in Western culture and why it's indirectly important to pay some attention to it, with eminently practical commentary on why certain fonts work best in certain applications, based on what their designers had in mind. Each two-page spread combines a photo on the left, as an object lesson for the point he wants to make, with two sections of text on the right -- the main discussion plus a more in-depth sidebar. In fact, the book's total layout is itself a nice example of what the author is attempting to teach the reader. This is one you'll want to go back and browse through at regular intervals.	2004-03-09

So when I get involved with new software of any kind, I immediately go looking for the best big, fat reference book I can find. I've been using PageMaker for about eight years to produce the quarterly journal I edit for a learned society, but decided it was time to jump to a newer program. But the series of manual-replacements published by Osborne-McGraw-Hill and Hayden, with which I've been very pleased in the past, don't seem to include a volume for InDesign, so I asked around and Gruman's past work was heavily recommended. They were still right, I'm happy to say. The opening chapters provide the clearest description I've found yet of the differences between the PageMaker approach and the QuarkXpress approach, the chapter on styles is excellent, and the whole section on prepress and packaging is now filled with Post-It bookmarks. And so is Appendix D, &quot;Switching from PageMaker.&quot; Gruman manages to clearly explain things on several levels at once, so both the muddler-through like me and the experienced graphics designer will be satisfied. And after I've taught myself the essential differences between the old and the new, the huge amount of pure reference material will keep this volume close at hand.	2004-03-06

This is 350 pages of highly detailed, heavily illustrated discussion of every conceivable subject and all its subtopics, from the engineering principles of ship design and the differences among each of the different rates, to the divisional organization of the Royal Marines, to the truth (with statistics) behind the press gang system, to a disquisition on the differences in naval fighting tactics between the British and French and Spanish fleets -- and a great deal more. And there are even graphs, flow charts, and organization tables to bring disparate informatiion together. It's actually a very slow read because there's so much to absorb, even for the experienced fan of Forester and O'Brian -- but that's certainly not a criticism! I'll be referring back to this gorgeous, oversized book for many years to come.	2004-02-29

Nevertheless, this novel has a definite dark side and the reader's laughter is apt to taper off into an uneasy awareness of just how nasty certain kinds of people can be. Especially the coldly fanatical religious types, about whom this is very much a cautionary tale. Om is the very small god of the title, once a great supernatural being with hundreds of thousands of believers keeping him stoked, but now reduced to the form of a two-pound desert tortoise and with only the steadfast belief of Brutha, a mere novice, keeping him alive. (&quot;Alive&quot; in the sense that gods, it seems, can die, just like everyone else.) The Omnian Church is doing well, though, ruling the populace through fear and torture and engendering no belief in the deity whatever. (The Omnians believe that the world is spherical and orbits the sun -- which on the Discworld is utter superstitious nonsense.) And at the top of that unpleasant heap is the dreaded Deacon Vorbis. Om can't read human minds but he can see their shapes, and Vorbis's mind has the shape of a steel ball. Nothing gets in and nothing gets out. Vorbis needs a new secretary -- the previous one having been used up -- and he takes Brutha out of his haven in the garden because of the young man's extraordinary memory. But being in close proximity to the Deacon is going to have an effect on Brutha's belief, and so is their diplomatic mission across the deep desert to Ephebe, home of happily contending philosophers and inventors. Some of the story's best characters appear in Ephebe, especially the Platonic-Aristotelian Didactylos and his apprentice, the proto-Archimedian Urn. An excellent book, humane, thoughtful, and not to be taken lightly at all.	2004-02-29

I'm the sort of person who reads style guides and specialized dictionaries for entertainment, and I'm also very interested in the process of neologism, so I was quick to pick up this volume. Unfortunately, it could have been much, much better. The editor claims to have selected about 2,500 of the \\"newest words\\" in English and to have \\"definied them precisely.\\" Not entirely true. Some included words aren't new by any reasonable definition, such as \\"areology\\" (late 19th century), \\"funnel cake\\" (certainly older than that), \\"feather\\" (in the sense of delicately blending or smoothing something, which was used of airplane engines at least seventy years ago), \\"rider\\" as a legal term in contract negotiation, \\"contingency fee\\" (another common legal term), and \\"Eeyorish,\\" which I remember my reading teacher using around 1950. Some are merely technical terms, like \\"protease inhbitor\\" or \\"genotype\\" or \\"geothermal,\\" and none of them is new in any case. Others, \\"like \\"Segway,\\" are simply recent trademarks, though they may become common genericisms later on. Or \\"Disneyland,\\" a fifty-year-old trademark. And in what way are \\"undimmed\\" or \\"unclothed\\" or \\"strife\\" or \\"carriage house\\" new words? Some aren't actually new *words*, but slang formation, such as \\"ass-backward,\\" or proper nouns, like \\"Federal Register.\\" Others are simply local or regional slang -- sunglasses are unlikely to be called \\"sunnies\\" anywhere besides Australia -- or words of long existence in other languages, like \\"dhikr\\" (which has to do with Sufism). Or \\"crubeen,\\" a traditonal item in Irish cuisine. They also include \\"dinkum,\\" another Aussie-ism which is hardly new. Then there's \\"stooshie,\\" a Scottishism a least a couple of centuries old. Many of the definitions show an unclear grasp of a word's nuances, like \\"cold warrior\\" (defined disingenuously as \\"a person who promotes a cold war\\"). Other definitions are simply incomplete. \\"Sex industry\\" covers considerably more than prostitution! Others, though, are very much a product of recent cultural changes, like \\"ecowarrior,\\" and \\"emo,\\" and \\"mommy track\\" and \\"casual Friday,\\" and \\"blog.\\" And, unfortunately, \\"date rape.\\" Some, like \\"right click\\" and \\"digital signature\\" and \\"portal\\" (in the Internet sense) have entered the more general language from origins in jargon.

As far as I'm aware, though, \\"bling-bling\\" is already dead and gone, avoided by the young and hip. But there are also odd omissions. Where's \\"Generation X\\"?

He's just a regular guy, dealing with a major mission. But now he seems to have acquired a personality and has therefore been sacked from his job. All the smaller deaths -- the Death of Tortoises, the Death of Daffodils, the Death of Rats, and so on -- which used to be subsumed in him are on their own. Death finds he now has a Life-Timer of his own, and the sands of the Future are pouring through the bottleneck of the Present and piling up in the Past. (Pratchett has a terrific way with words.) What else is there for him to do but seek work on a Discworld farm, harvesting corn instead of lives? More important, with no Death to keep it under control, life force is piling up, making its vital presence felt in the form of poltergeist activity and a plague of snowglobes and supermarket baskets, which are only the harbingers of the dreaded appearance of Mall Life. Meanwhile, 130-year-old wizard Windle Poons has just died -- but Death, who is out of a job and not yet been replaced, hasn't come for him. Windle is one of the undead, so naturally he is approached by dead-activists. Then he gets caught up in the struggle against too much life being carried on (reluctantly) by the faculty of Unseen University, of which he was lately a member. And I haven't even mentioned Mrs. Cake and her werewoman daughter, or Lupine, or the grocer vampire, or the bashful banshee who slips notes under doors instead of screaming. Pratchett is a first-rate parodist but he's also a very talented designer of complex and highly original plots and characters.	2004-02-15

It's the near future, a decade after the end of manned U.S. Space Shuttle flights, which was the result of the disappearance of the shuttle VENTURE from its orbit. But now VENTURE is back, landing at Kennedy (and taking out a few score squatters in the process) with only John Cost, the pilot-commander, aboard. The quickly cobbled-together team of experts are driving themselves nuts trying to figure out where the shuttle has been, and how, and why. Ellis's story beautifully captures the excitement of weird physics and makes an emotional case for the continuation of manned space flight, and Doran's strightforward drawing style is a perfect match for the prose. The irony, of course, is that between the completion of the book and its publication, we lost COLUMBIA on its landing approach -- an event which especially chills the heart of every proponent of manned space exploration because the cry has again been raised for robots to take the place of humans in space. Ellis and Doran know we must never allow that to happen.	2004-02-02

Except for the first few and last few pages, the water-going vessels depicted and analyzed in this fascinating book aren't &quot;boats&quot; -- they're definitely ships. Ships made of wood, developed by tradition and experiment, hand-shaped, pegged together, and amazingly seaworthy. Moreover, what you see here is not merely technical drawings or models -- though those are lovely -- but recreations and reconstructions of the real thing, from a Viking longship and the SUSAN CONSTANT (which made the 1607 voyage to Jamestown) to the BATAVIA and the AMSTERDAM, both Dutch East Indiamen. Also included in the analysis are several musuem ships, like the CHARLES W. MORGAN, and purpose-built modern wooden vessels, like the PRIDE OF BALTIMORE. This is a book all those intrigued by the history of sail power will want to own.	2004-02-02

If you're a fan of nautical adventure, this is definitely a book you want to own. Lavery, a greatly respected naval historian, has written several earlier volumes on the Royal Navy of the Napoleonic period (including the highly regarded _Nelson's Navy_), and he was also one of the principal technical advisors on Peter Weir's film, MASTER AND COMMANDER. (Weir, in fact, provides a glowing Foreword.) This heavily illustrated volume tries to cover all the bases, organizing its topics into chapters like &quot;The World of the Seaman,&quot; &quot;The Ships,&quot; &quot;Officers,&quot; &quot;The Lower Deck,&quot; &quot;Techniques,&quot; and so on. Technical information is provided but is kept under control so as not to frighten the novice, and he quotes heavily from early Victorian memoires, biographies, and histories -- and also from the works of Marryat, Forester, O'Brian, and even Jane Austen's _Persuasion_. On the other hand, Lavery, unfortunately, was not well served by his editor, copyeditor, or proofreader. (Having worked for them myself in the past, as a freelance editor, I know Naval Institute Press is capable of far better support work.) There often are several typos, omitted words, and confusing references on a single page. There also are a number of incorrect or incomplete source citations and at least one mislabeled diagram (on page 104). Lavery also is prone to frequent and unnecessary repetition in his discourse, especially in explaining points of shiphandling and other technical matters. Finally, the index and the bibliography are rather amateurishly organized. But on the *other* other hand, I finally understand catharpins!	2004-02-01

Its December 1964 in a remote, almost feudal Derbyshire village and thirteen-year-old Alison Carter has gone missing while taking her dog for a walk after school. When she hasnt returned after five hours in freezing weather, her panicked mother calls the cops, and so begins the first major case in the career of newly-promoted Detective Inspector George Bennett, a university graduate on the fast track. Alison cant be found, nor is there a body, but enough evidence gradually accumulates to convince Bennett and his principal helper, Detective Sgt. Tommy Clough, that a murder has indeed been committed -- but whodunnit? Hang on, though -- its not as simple as all that. Not even close. Because thirty-five years after the crime has apparently been solved, after the case has come to a firm legal conclusion, journalist Catherine Heathcote, who grew up nearby, becomes interested in the case and George agrees to help her in writing a book. And then things begin to unravel. McDermid is very good at developing and delineating character and in leading the reader (especially American readers) through the complexities of British police and judicial procedure, and while she tends to over-write on occasion, she certainly makes you care what happens to the insular inhabitants of Scardale. Properly cast, this book would make an excellent film.	2004-02-01

My own copy of the 6th edition (published in 1971), filled with paperclips and bookmarks, sat next to my old manual typewriter, where I wrote letters of inquiry to county clerks and probate offices all over the country. In its essentials, this latest edition hasn't changed from its predecessors - but there's certainly a whole lot more of it!<br /><br />The book's organization continues what we've been used to. Each state's chapter (the District of Columbia is here, too) begins with a brief overview of its history and governmental organization, followed by a lengthy list of societies, libraries, and other records repositories, and then a newly updated and expanded topically organized subject bibliography. Then comes the list of counties, each with date of formation and parent county, the full official address, phone number, and web site address (new to this edition), and details on which record groups are available for what time-spans. A simplified color map clearly shows county boundaries, rivers, and a few major cities. Border counties of adjacent states are also usefully shown, but not highways, railroads, or county seats, which I could wish had been included. A blank page for notes at the end of each chapter may encourage the user to record updates of contact information.<br /><br />Following the U.S. section are similar chapters for nineteen selected foreign countries, all European or English-speaking (Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), plus Mexico. Again, while the selected countries probably are those for which most American genealogists will want to have contact information, there is actually a growing interest in our pluralistic society regarding Japanese, Vietnamese, Indian, and Middle Eastern family research, and well-written chapters on the resources of those comparatively unfamiliar ancestral lands would have been most welcome.<br /><br />Checking under state and local societies and libraries whose addresses and phone numbers I know from my own research (including a couple that had recently changed), I found several instances of sloppy fact-checking and copyediting, including duplicated listings under &quot;Louisiana Genealogical and Historical Society&quot; and &quot;Louisiana Genealogical &amp; Historical Society,&quot; one of which had an incorrect ZIP code and an outdated phone number. And why are there three different listings for the Louisiana Historical Association, all with slightly different addresses -- and which one is correct?<br /><br />Despite its recognized shortcomings (the editing problems have been noted in my reviews of previous editions), the _Handybook_ (which used to be two words, _Handy Book_) will continue to be a basic reference tool. If you have a copy of the 9th edition, you likely will be slow to purchase a copy of this monster, given its unavoidably high price, but I hope everyone will at least encourage their local libraries to acquire it!egarding Japanese, Vietnamese, Indian, and Middle Eastern family research, and well-written chapters on the resources of those comparatively unfamiliar ancestral lands would have been most welcome.<br /><br />Checking under state and local societies and libraries whose addresses and phone numbers I know from my own research (including a couple that had recently changed), I found several instances of sloppy fact-checking and copyediting, including duplicated listings under &quot;Louisiana Genealogical and Historical Society&quot; and &quot;Louisiana Genealogical &amp; Historical Society,&quot; one of which had an incorrect ZIP code and an outdated phone number.

In fact, a household that was missed in the general census (it happens to all of us) is quite likely to show up there. The agricultural schedule names only the head of each household, but also provides considerable other information that helps to place the family in context in the community. Actually, it consists of forty-eight columns, showing production of everything from bushels of tobacco and gallons of wine to pounds of beeswax and tons of &quot;water rotted hemp.&quot; Green, who has previously abstracted the agricultural censuses of Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, and several other states, has limited herself to only six columns: Name of the owner, improved and unimproved acreage, cash value of the farm itself, value of farm implements and machinery, and value of livestock. These generally give a good indication of the prosperity of the establishment and, because these data are common all across the country (unlike cotton or flax production), the researcher may gain a good idea of wealth relative to other regions. The transcription follows the order in which names were recorded by the census enumerator within each parish, with a surname-only index in each volume. Original page numbers are not given, however. The parishes appear alphabetically, Ascension through Madison in Volume 1 and Morehouse through Winn in Volume 2 (which may also be purchased separately). If you find someone of interest here, of course, I recommend you make a date with a microfilm reader and examine the full listing!	2004-01-30

Turner's Company of the 2nd Regiment of the United States Army	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Excellent source for an under-studied period in La. history	Edward Turner was born about 1768, probably near Boston, a descendant of early settlers in the Plymouth Colony. In 1791, he was commissioned an ensign in the U.S. Army, serving thereafter in New England as a paymaster and quartermaster, and being promoted to captain in 1794, with supply duties on the frontier. Two years later, he was in command of a company at Ft. Fayette (near Pittsburgh), accompanied by a new wife. In 1802, he found himself at Nashville, then Ft. Pickering, near the present site of Memphis. By the following year, he was at Ft. Adams, Mississippi Territory, where he was summoned by Gov. William C. C. Claiborne and told he was to be in charge of supplying the federal troops being moved to New Orleans following the Louisiana Purchase. Claiborne continued the colonial Louisiana practice of having local military commanders serve also as civil administrators, so when Turner was sent in April 1804 to establish an American military presence at the town of Natchitoches, he was to serve also as the local head of government. When he was replaced a year later, Turner resigned his commission and was immediately appointed Judge of Natchitoches County. He was later appointed the first postmaster as well, organized a local militia, and carried out a census, in addition to acquiring and expanding plantation holdings in the area. His promising career in the new state was cut short in 1811, however, by one of the periodic waves of malaria and he and his wife both were buried within forty-eight hours. This biographical research was developed by Richard M. Lytle in the process of writing a master's thesis, but the bulk of this volume consists of the unusually legible military records he uncovered at the National Archives and which were transcribed by Womack, a well-known Louisiana genealogist with a deserved reputation for producing careful work. This includes muster rolls and payrolls of Turner's Company for the period 1802-1805. Some of the men listed were part of the unit at Nashville and at Ft. Adams, while others joined in New Orleans and in Natchitoches itself. Some of them also were discharged there and may well have descendants in northwest Louisiana.he unit at Nashville and at Ft.

Brent Holcomb also is well known, or should be, as probably the leading living authority on the genealogy of and records sources in South Carolina. Over the years, he has published dozens of volumes of &quot;vital records&quot; abstracted from newspapers - birth, marriage, death, and burial notices and even coroner's reports, to substitute for the official records that mostly began only in the 20th century. Holcomb's work always is more useful (and interesting) than that of many abstractors who record only bare names and dates because he provides context with a significant amount of the original article or obituary. E.g., &quot;The deeply felt grief of a mourning family, for the premature death of a beloved brother, had scarcely settled into the calm of resignation ere relentless fate has consigned another to the silent tomb,&quot; . . . which certainly should alert the researcher to hunt for another record associated with this family. Then there's the death notice in June 1828 of William Taylor, &quot;an active partizan in favor of our Independence during the Revolutionary War,&quot; and Capt. Robert Hatton of the brig Nautilus, who died at &quot;Cape Messurado, Coast of Africa.&quot;	2004-01-30

To produce such a volume, the publication committee of the French-Canadian/Acadian Genealogists of Wisconsin first considered republishing a collection of articles from its Quarterly, but realized too many of them required major revision and that a number of other topics had not been addressed at all. This book became a six-year project and the quality of the results of their labors is generally quite high, and the researcher is likely to come back to it again and again, not only for instruction in wringing the most out of the key primary and secondary sources but for ready reference. The introductory section summarizes the history of French Canada, provides a detailed timeline, explains Quebecois naming patterns, and describes the seigneurial system under which New France operated. The section on primary materials gives details on obtaining and using French-Canadian church records, the place of civil registration in Quebec, and the use of notarial records (with which south Louisiana researchers should already be familiar). An extended discussion of the dozen or so most important secondary sources accounts for about one-third of the volume, and includes Tanguay's _Dictionnaire Genealogique_, Leboeuf's _Complement to Tanguay_, the _Loiselle Quebec Marriage Index_, Jette's _Dictionnaire Genealogique_ of families to 1730, the _Repetoire des actes_, and the _Programme de researche en demographie historique_ (the PRDH), among others. Each of these chapters moves from an overview to a detailed discussion of what information is included and how to make the best use of it. There are numerous examples and illustrations. A further section of specialized topics includes a very good article on the &quot;filles du roi&quot; and others on Canadian military records and the special problems of researching fur-trading ancestors. (A very brief outline of genealogy on the Internet, however, would have been better omitted.) A series of appendices provide relevant maps, essential French vocabulary, how dates are written in French, the details of Canadian census records and census substitutes, and a lengthy list of addresses of libraries, archives, and organizations in French Canada. The writing quality throughout is high and in an extended perusal I was able to detect no glaring errors or omissions. If you have any interest in French-Canadian family research, I can recommend this one for your primary reference shelf.ized topics includes a very good article on the &quot;filles du roi&quot; and others on Canadian military records and the special problems of researching fur-trading ancestors.

There are only two real characters in this drama, narrated in Trevor's usual spare, sparse style that puts you into the heart of things. There's Felicia, a somewhat plain teenage girl from a depressed industrial town in the Irish Republic. She's the product of a convent school, but only on suffrance because her father tends the convent's gardens. She's inexperienced and naive and when Johnny Lysaght comes along and turns her head, her subsequent pregnancy is no surprise. And there's Mr. Hilditch, a fifty-something catering manager at a factory in the English Midlands, who lives by himself and fancies young girls, though he's very careful &quot;not to shop near home,&quot; as he thinks of it. Felicia runs away from home in search of the absent Johnny, but she finds it's not easy even to survive, much less to locate an errant Irishman, in England. She's a bit suspicious of Hilditch when he tries to help her out, but he arranges things to reduce her options, and Felicia is suddenly in very great danger indeed. Trevor does a terrific job getting inside the head of a pleasant, mild-mannered psychopath, allowing the reader to gradually understand what makes him tick. He won the Whitbread Prize (again) for this novel and he deserved it.	2004-01-24

He's much more concerned with telling the story than with inventive layouts, cinematic artwork, and impenetrable plot-lines, as so many of his younger contemporaries are. That said, I'm afraid I'm not as impressed with this effort as with, say, _A Contract with God._ This is a retelling of Dickens's _Oliver Twist_ from the point of view of the much-loathed Fagin, mentor of street urchins in the ways of London ghetto survival, with emphasis on his early life and character development. The thing is, even knowing how he developed into the creep he became, even sympathizing to some extent with his lousy home life and bad breaks, there's still not much to like about Fagin. Although there's not much to like about most of his contemporaries, either. For that matter, Oliver himself, revealed in adulthood as a rather smugly successful barrister, also comes across as less than admirable. If this is the point Eisner wanted to make, he has succeeded, but I had hoped for something psychologically a bit deeper.	2004-01-23

This sensitively written first novel is being marketed as a mystery, but that's only part of it -- and the lesser part, in my opinion. It's 1929 and 33-year-old Maisie Dobbs, daughter of a London costermonger, is hanging out our shingle as what amounts to a \\"consulting detective\\" somewhat in the Holmesian style. She's certainly not a gumshoe. Though she started out as a maid-of-all-work in a big townhouse, her natural intelligence and intuitive talents, combined with her mistress's desire to do some good in the Edwardian era, result in her private education by Maurice Blanche, an old friend of Lady Rowan who becomes her mentor. Then she goes off to a women's college at Cambridge, until the Great War interferes. And that, in fact, is the center of this novel: The War. What it did to an entire generation of young English men and women and to their families, and the effects it had on English society even a dozen years later. Both Winspear's own grandfathers served and she has a strong feeling for the subject, but that may actually prove to be a problem for later books in the series of which this is the first. If you remove all the backstory about Maisie's upbringing and experiences as a nurse at the front, the actual \\"mystery\\" -- which involves skullduggery at a Kentish retreat for wounded and disfigured soldiers -- is a little thin. And Maisie is sometimes a bit *too* good, as are her friends and the love of her life, Capt. Simon Lynch of the Royal Army Medical Corps. But it's a compelling piece of work, and I'll be very interested to see if the author can keep it up.	2004-01-17

There's the Sprague DeCamp/Robert Silverberg kind of story, full of large, historymaking events, and the Time Patrol to protect the continuum, and knowledgeable time travelers making things happen. And there's the Jack Finney kind of story, about ordinary people dealing with small-scale events in out-of-the-way towns and trying hard simply to cope with things that happen to them willy-nilly. Dickinson has written a warm, funny, affecting example of the second kind of story. Josh Winkler is a somewhat feckless artist living in Euclid Heights, Illinois, where crosswise shortcut paths known as \\"perp walks\\" disturb the town's gridded layout. He's married to a doctor, the sister of his brother Kurt's best friend when they were kids, before her brother drowned in the town pool and Kurt suffered permanent brain damage. Their fifteen-year-old daughter, Penny -- the best-drawn character in the book, I think -- is about all that's still keeping them together. Then Josh gets caught riding his bike in a storm on one of the perp walks and is tossed fifteen minutes into the past. But young Constance, who appears soon after, has a worse time of it, dragged into our own era from 1908. Can she get back? Can she adapt to our world? And what happens if someone else becomes an unintentional time traveler? Dickinson's style is quiet and thoughtful; he almost lets the story tell itself. An excellent piece of work.	2004-01-13

If asked to define the essential duty of a host, most of us probably would agree with the ancient Akkadians: \\"Give food to eat, beer to drink, grant what is requested, provide for and treat with honor.\\" Well, the author shows that it's much more complex than that. Who's in charge? The guest or the host? (Well, who decides the dinner menu, who sits where, etc?) Do you invite only friends to a party? Or do you go with the original Greek meeting of \\"hospitality\\" and welcome strangers to your home? Browner also makes a convincingly case that for a ruler, like Hitler or Louis XIV, hospitality is a manipulative tool of state policy. He claims not to be an historian, but his grasp of the past is quite solid, and his witty, felicitous style makes for a pleasureable and entertaining read. The chapter comparing Lady Ottoline Morell and Gertrude Stein -- the former a nearly complete failure as a hostess, the latter a considerable success -- is especially good, as is his discussion of what he describes as the historical antithesis of hospitality: the German takeover of the Roman Empire.	2004-01-12

There are, I believe, a couple dozen titles now in the Discworld series, but this one -- the fourth -- is still one of the best. Death, who SPEAKS IN ALL CAPITALS, and takes his job seriously, decides nevertheless that he's in need of a break. So he takes on an apprentice, a young farm lad named Mortimer -- Mort for short. On his first solo soul-collecting assignment, Mort discovers he can't allow the teenaged Princess Keli to be assassinated by her uncle the Duke, tries to prevent what is supposed to happen -- what *must* happen -- and, of course, messes thing up. Reality tends to heal itself in the long run, though, and there's no way the kid can stop history from getting back on its proper track. But he's certainly going to try. As one might expect in a Pratchett yarn, things get a bit out of hand after that, especially when Death goes AWOL for a time, trying out human experiences and vices, and when Mort begins taking on more and more of his boss's characteristics. After all, as Mort explains to Death's adopted daughter, Ysabell, DEATH IS WHOEVER DOES DEATH'S JOB. The final confrontation between Mort and Death is a marvelous set-piece. Can Mort win? Can Death lose? Is it even fair? THERE IS NO JUSTICE, as Death is fond of remarking. THERE'S ONLY ME.	2004-01-12

Good thing, too, because the Discworld (which is supported by four great elephants standing on the back of a gigantic sea turtle) is not an easy place to survive in. Then there's Twoflower, a tourist from the Counterweight Continent, possessed of more gold than is good for him (or for anyone else) and a rather vicious piece of ambulatory luggage, whose chances of survival appear rather slim until Rincewind takes on a job as his guide. Pratchett is smack in the best tradition of britcom and any fan of Monty Python and Douglas Adams will be right at home with the author's droll style and witty turns of classic characters. But Pratchett is not only a master of literate parody but a very inventive and original creator of comic fantasy. You probably won't want to read a whole bunch of the books in this series one right after another, though. Rather, treat these tales as you would a box of expensive chocolates, parceling them out gradually and chewing slowly.	2004-01-06

But that level of 2-D was nothing, of course, compared to the MYST series and to god/simulations like SimCity 3 -- not to mention keyframe animation and real-time interaction and detailed storyboarding that wouldn't be out of place in Hollywood. This is the first book I've seen that really gets into all aspects of video game art and design (there wouldn't have been enough to say even a few years ago), and it succeeds nicely both in its glossy-paper graphics and in the discursive text, which includes numerous interviews with designers.	2004-01-06

This is only the second of the author's &quot;Kay Scarpetta&quot; novels that I've read, and I wasn't all that impressed with _Postmortem,_ so I approached this fourth book in the series with some scepticism, even though It seems to be one of the best reviewed. After a decade of appeals, Ronnie Joe Waddell is finally being executed and Scarpetta waits to perform the autopsy (though I'm not clear why that should be necessary). But that same evening, a young boy is ritually murdered in a manner very reminiscent of Waddell's style. That's followed by another murder -- and Waddell's fingerprints apparently are found on the scene. Was someone else executed in his place? The authorities involved, of course, don't even want to *think* about such an appalling possibility. More murders follow, including Scarpetta's own Morgue Attendant, and suddenly links seem to be turning up to tie the Chief Medical Examiner to the killings, as well as to corruption in her own office. All the action takes place in the few weeks preceding and following the Christmas-New Year's holidays, and the gray, cold winter adds greatly to the flavor of the narration.<br /><br />There's no question that this one is an improvement over the first one I read. Cornwell doesn't bring in a completely new character in the last chapter to be the villain, for one thing. And she has added considerable depth to the personalities of all the repeating characters, especially Lt. Pete Marino of Richmond Homicide and FBI Special Agent Benton Wesley. My favorite, though, is Lucy, Scarpetta's niece from Miami, who possesses what another character calls a &quot;frightening intellect.&quot; But she's still seventeen years old, and her home life is, in many ways, not a happy one. Aunt Kay really does try to be the friend and confident to Lucy that she would like to be, but she has her own emotional problems -- not least among them the death of her lover in an IRA bombing in London less than a year before -- and her naturally reserved and somewhat stony personality is sometimes her own worst liability.<br /><br />There are problems, though. Cornwell has a rather pompous style, especially when she's describing the latest crime-fighting technological advances, or the ins and outs of UNIX. It's as if she enjoys saying &quot;I know more about this than you do.&quot; She also indulges in irritating word-choices, such as not knowing the difference between &quot;in&quot; and &quot;inside&quot; (e.g., &quot;I put my revolver inside my purse&quot;), and she seems to be unaware of the use of contractions in ordinary speech. Still, the well thought out plot and the complications in possible motives and interpretations kept me reading. Many fans and reviewers take it as a given that Cornwell is the &quot;best&quot; mystery writer working, which I can't agree with at all.

When he's not paying attention, however, his stuff can be overwritten and under-thought, sloppily edited and thin in the plot line. More than that, this first volume in a series is obviously a Young Adult book but there's no indication of the target audience anywhere on it. The premise is that sometime in the next few decades, we will stumble across the technology (never explained or even theorized about) to cross into variant timelines: Worlds where Germany won World War II, where the Armada conquered England, where the Vikings stayed in New England and beat off later European settlers, etc. In other words, all the usual alternate history themes. Specifically, this one is set in an alternate Rome where Agrippa survived into old age, conquered Germania for Augustus, and established a 2,000-year empire which is now just beginning to develop cannon and flintlocks. Teenagers Jeremy and Amanda Solters accompany their mercantilist parents every summer to an alternate town in Romania (Dacia in that world), where they carry on a brisk business in pocket watches, glass mirrors, and Swiss Army knives. They have to be careful not to upset things in that world by talking too much -- just what effect all this alien technology is supposed to have is lightly passed over -- and they take grain in trade rather than silver because the Home Line needs the food. Then their mother develops appendicitis and has to be escorted back through the portal by their father. And then the portal malfunctions and the kids, naturally, have to fend for themselves -- possibly forever. And then the Lietuvans (Lithuanians) invade. And then, and then, and then. The author takes every opportunity to impress upon the reader just how dirty and disease-ridden and ignorant and generally unpleasant Agrippan Rome is. (Yeah, so are Ecuador and Bangladesh and the South Bronx in this world. . . .) But he does it by talking down to the reader, using short sentences, and repeating the didactic messages over and over. I got two-thirds of the way through and found I didn't much care *what* happened to Jeremy and Amanda, so I tossed aside this not-thick book (288 small-size pages) and went on to something else that wasn't a waste of my reading time.

There's not enough work to go around, most of the powers that be don't want to admit how bad things are, and people have to hang together to get by. And for the most part, they do. Jacob Shtarkah, a carpenter, after completing a five-year building project for the synagogue, finds they don't need his labor any longer. He also has a bad heart, and his wife isn't in such great shape either. Then there's Elton Shaftsbury, who manages to lose his inheritance, his position as a broker on Wall Street, and much of his self-respect. He ends up in the Bronx, where the living is cheaper, trying to find work and contemplating suicide -- and becoming acquainted with Jacob's daughter, Rebecca. The Black Hand is trying to get by, too, by pressuring illegal immigrants whom they helped to enter the country. Angelo, also a carpenter, is one of those -- but he and Jacob may be able to help each other. Willie, Jacob's teenaged son, is flirting with Red revolution, . . . but he'll choose his mother's cooking any day. And there's Frieda Gold, trapped in Nazi Germany, who turns to her old boyfriend -- Jacob, of course -- for help in escaping. But you know they'll all survive because they all share the life force, as exemplified by the cockroaches in the alley. Eisner practically invented the graphic novel form singlehanded, and the more of his stories I read, the more he takes me into his world. But this volume isn't just a \\"story.\\" It's literature, a saga of immigrant striving, of muddling through against the odds. Great stuff.	2004-01-06

Evanovich is getting better and better at this series. Stephanie Plum, semi-reluctant bounty hunter for five months now for her bail bondsmen cousin, Vinnie, is still trying hard, still learning her trade, still relying on others as necessary. If she didn't live in Trenton's blue-collar &quot;burg,&quot; surrounded by supportive family, old school friends, and her ever-reliable gossip network, she probably would never make it. But she can always call on Ranger, a truly bad-ass bounty hunter and her sometime mentor. And she can always go home for meals when the checks are slow in coming. And especially, she can always depend on vice cop Morelli to show up with pizza, park outside her apartment building watching for the bad guys, and keep her lust stoked. This time, the quarry is the burg's beloved &quot;Uncle Mo&quot; Bedemier, proprietor of the candy store, who has always opposed drugs and bad influences generally and whose store has long been a safe haven for kids. Uncle Mo got tapped by a rookie for carrying concealed and not only has he blown off his court date (which makes him scum as far as Vinnie is concerned, regardless of how the rest of the community feels about him), he's completely disappeared. More than that, drug dealers begin disappearing, too, including several that Stephanie and her wannabe sidekick, Lula, literally stumble over themselves. As with the first two books, there are plenty of very funny, very cinematic scenes here -- especially the great chicken takedown.	2004-01-06

I'm getting to like Stephanie Plum, Trenton's most unlikely bounty-hunter. I especially like Grandma Mazur, Trenton's answer to Dirty Harry! Stephanie could stick with the small-time bond-jumpers, but they don't pay enough, so she feels the need to make a comparatively big score by bringing in Kenny Mancuso, charged with shooting his cousin Moogey in the knee. But then Moogey gets dead and the odds go up. And stolen Army weapons enter the picture. And so does Joe Morelli, one of Trenton's finest and also Kenny's cousin. It's a complicated plot but Evanovich handles it very well and with considerable wry humor. She's also very good at delineating the scarier characters and assorted sociopaths who crop up. What I want to know is, why hasn't there been a movie made from this series? The scene in the beauty parlor and the last scene in the funeral home basement would make terrific footage. I see someone like Renee Zellweger as Stephanie. . . .	2004-01-06

I'm a great fan of Lodge's novels, so I was surprised to find a title published in the UK in 1999 with which I was not familiar. Short, too -- only 115 pages. It turns out to be a novelization of a stage play, which means it's about 95 percent dialogue. Which is okay with me, since Lodge is very good at divulging character through dialogue. This one is about Adrian Ludlow, ex-novelist, now living with his wife in a cottage under the flight path from Gatwick, and his long-time friend, Sam Sharp, a financially very successful screenwriter. It's the early summer of 1997 and Sam has recently been savaged by a London newspaper interviewer called Fanny Tarrant -- one of those paparazzi-in-print whose reputations are built on making gleeful mincemeat of the famous. There are any number of editors who would like to see Fanny taken down a peg or three, and Sam has a plan for revenge. Fanny also had approached Adrian about an interview and he, being no fool, had declined. But what if he were to agree, and then write his own scathing counter-interview, turning her own methods back upon her? Adrian agrees, not entirely for Sam's sake, . . . but, of course, none of it goes quite according to plan. Not for Adrian, not for his wife, Eleanor, not even for Fanny. As Lodge quotes from the OED, a &quot;home truth&quot; is &quot;a wounding mention of a person's weakness,&quot; and that's what this piece is about, in spades. This isn't one of Lodge's major efforts, but it's certainly worth reading.	2004-01-06

As both a very heavy reader of broad tastes and interests, and a librarian (i.e., a professional recommender of books), I'm always on the look-out for new lists of other people's reading recommendations. This one runs to nearly 500 pages, most of it in the form of brief, individually authored articles (from less than half a column in length to two-thirds of a page) on writers who mostly have been originally published in English, ranging from Defoe and Dickens to Patricia Cornwell and Neal Stephenson. There are also nearly three dozen topical essays -- Canada, Fantasy, Film Adaptations, The Sea, Teen, etc -- which I frankly found too idiosyncratic to be of much use. It took me several weeks to work my way slowly through this thing, notepad at hand to jot down authors and titles that were new to me, or which the reviewer convinced me I ought to reconsider. I filled more than a dozen pages, which means I can happily push this volume on other dedicated readers. Not that I don't have some caveats. No such book can be all-inclusive, of course, so I won't complain about the (in my opinion) excellent authors who were omitted. Though I'm annoyed that a relatively minor science fiction author from the '50s like John Wyndham is discussed, but not the innovative John Varley. On the other hand, can you even begin to talk about Robert Coover without mentioning his most widely-read novel, _The Universal Baseball Association, Inc.?_ Or Stephen King with no mention of _The Stand,_ which is as close as he has yet come to a magnum opus? There seems also to be a heavy emphasis on British writers, with many minor names being included out of proportion to less-known U.S. authors; this bias is not noted in the Introduction, but becomes obvious as you browse. Well, an editor's lot is never an easy one. But they really should have included a title index.	2003-12-09

It takes a particular sort of reader to rejoice at the prospect of an all-new translation of a 900-year-old government-sponsored economic and agricultural census. I'm well acquainted with the Phillimore 35-volume edition published in the 1970s, and I own Finn's guide to it, but this new effort is a lovely piece of work -- and it's portable enough to actually carry around with you. The Alecto translation was itself based on the Victoria History of the Counties of England version, but much improved and updated. This volume also omits the marginalia, which is too bad, but it does interpolate a great many bracketed words to fill the original scribe's frequent elisions. There's also an extremely thorough Index of Places -- but not one of persons, a glaring omission, since so many larger landholders possessed estates throughout a county, or even in numerous counties. Nevertheless, an excellent publication, and at a very reasonable price.	2003-12-03

It can be difficult making the transition from graduate student to college professor, and in nearly all colleges and universities -- unless you're one of the fortunate few to be adopted by a talented mentor -- you have to do most of it all by yourself, with only the occasional anecdotal assistance from other newbies. Even though all your more senior colleagues made the same journey from chrysalis to butterfly (or moth, in many cases), they quickly forget the tribulations of the process, and so there is little or nothing in the way of meaningful orientation offered at most schools. I had high hopes for this not-thick volume as a useful manual to assist the newly appointed instructor, and it indeed does the service of bringing a lot of material together in one place, but a reader who has been thinking and reading about the subject for a few years will find nothing original here. All the advice on teaching methods, advising students, why and how to get yourself published, why and how to pursue grant money, and the great and foggy subject of &quot;faculty service&quot; has been cribbed from other (presumably more original) authors. However, the thing I found particularly off-putting about this book is that all of it is couched in a self-conscious vocabulary and phrasing that almost serves as a model of academic-speak. And that's not a compliment!	2003-12-03

Takeshi Kovacs, a native of Harlan's World and an ex-member of the thoroughly lethal UN Envoys, has inhabited many bodies in his career, both male and female, both natural and enhanced or even synthetic. That's the way life is lived in the 25th century. This ability to transfer personality and memories from one &quot;sleeve&quot; to another on demand also means it's seldom necessary to experience Real Death -- if you can afford it. It also means that the need for societal punishment usually results in having your cortical stack put on ice for a few decades, or even centuries -- and you might not get your own body back when you're released. Kovacs, though, is not typical, not even for an Envoy, and when he (or his consciousness) is needlecast across 180 light years to Earth by the excessively wealthy Laurens Bancroft to be offered a job investigating Bancroft's murder, he finds he can't refuse. The investigation gets him involved with all levels of Earth's society and with a wide variety of very artfully drawn characters, and he soon finds himself caught up in a vast conspiracy that he has very little chance of surviving. Woven through the story is Quellist philosophy (&quot;Take it personally&quot;) and Kovacs's previous history and the ghosts that haunt him. This blend of noir detective thriller and uncommonly inventive cyberpunk is an astonishing piece of work for a first novel, and I expect Morgan to become well known in the sf community in a very short space of time.	2003-11-30

It's takes nerve to invent a new Napoleonic War-era fictional naval hero when you're competing with Horatio Hornblower and Jack Aubrey, not to mention a half-dozen lesser lights. Except Alan Lewrie isn't really \\"heroic,\\" though he has nerve when needed. He's the bastard offspring of a scheming member of the minor London aristocracy, well educated enough and skilled with weapons, but profligate with money and definitely a \\"user\\" when it comes to women. After being set up (we don't know why -- yet) and caught in bed with his half-sister, he has the choice of being hauled before a magistrate or being packed off to sea as a midshipman. After a rough few months, he learns his trade well enough to be of some use on a deck and discovers a love of artillery. He makes some friends, loses some, commits some dreadful blunders, and has some unexpected successes. He's not a villain but neither is he entirely honest. In other words, he's a very human being and probably better than most of his class by our standards. Lambdin writes with humor and verve, inventing believable characters and painting excellent word pictures of the engagements in which Lewrie takes part -- but I wish he hadn't so casually elided what appear to be substantial portions of his protagonist's first year at sea.	2003-11-12

Nina Zero, on parole after imprisonment for a (justified) manslaughter -- for the details of which you need to read the previous two novels -- is trying hard to stay straight and make a living as a paparazza for a Los Angeles tabloid, but by now there's virtually none of the original good-girl Mary Alice Baker left. Deep down, she's a good person, but she's also quite capable of dealing with the county slammer when she gets picked up &quot;on suspicion&quot; (which happens to parolees on a regular basis). The first novel, _Shooting Elvis,_ was very, very good as a character study; the second one, _Killing Paparazzi,_ was okay but more of a straight detective story. This third installment sports the brand label &quot;A Nino Zero Novel&quot; on the front cover, which is not a good sign. The plot revolves around the death by arson of a reclusive movie star in the Malibu hills, which the cops like Nina for, since she was conveniently present. The deceased actress's estranged neice and sort-of stepfather (himself a crusty retired cop who takes a shine to Nina) want to find out whodunit and Nina, with the help of her equally crusty editor boss, needs to clear herself in order to stay on the outside. The action is complicated by additional deaths, but the real interest here is in the way Eversz draws his characters -- not only Nina but all the supporting cast. I had my doubts before whether this could survive as a series, and I still have them, but Nina is a fascinating portrait and I'll keep reading.	2003-11-09

More than 1,000 technical line drawings by a very skilled illustrator takes you from prehistoric bladder-floats and Assyrian reed boats, through Roman grain carriers and Columbus's little PINTA (a &quot;caravela redonda&quot;) and West Indiamen of the 18th century, right up to a modern Japanese motor junk and even the KON-TIKI, not to mention every rigged warship and clipper you ever heard of. And scores of variations on the common fishing boat. And Antarctic exploration vessels. And modern pleasure yachts. And on and on and on! Woodman's equally clear and detailed explanatory text is icing on the cake. The whole thing is printed on heavy coated paper, which greatly enhances the detail. This is not at all a cheap book, but if this subject fascinates you (as it does me), it's definitely the best thing out there.	2003-11-06

I've been a fan of Hornblower and Aubrey and their ilk for many, many years -- but I'm not a sailor, so I sometimes have had to do some research to understand just what I'm reading. Pope is a well-known naval historian and he does an excellent job in this heavily illustrated volume, explaining the role of the highly successful Royal Navy in the late 18th century, describing the jobs and relative stations of officers, ratings and warrant officers (and also of the various rates of warships), and describing the sailor-man's life and his daily routine. He makes it clear that, however horrendous life at sea might have been compared to our own time, the Brits were far better at it and generally much more humane than the French and their allies.	2003-11-06

This well-meant companion volume to the author's _Two Fisted Science_ is, unfortunately, not nearly as successful as graphic fiction. This time, five women artists tell the stories of five women scientists. While trying to focus on lesser-known people, Ottaviani finally broke down and included a fore-and-aft pair of shorts on Marie Curie. If you've read Watson's _The Double Helix,_ you may already have heard of Rosalind Franklin, who came very close to discovering the essential shape of DNA before Crick and Watson -- had she only not moved in the wrong direction on a couple of minor points (and possessed a less abrasive personality). Barbara McClintock picked up a Nobel for her work on the corn genome, you'd really never know what her field was from the badly written story (though the art is okay). Birut&eacute; Galdikas has become the world's leading authority on orangutans (yes, she's still out there in the jungles of Borneo) and you'll learn a lot about them -- and her -- from Anne Timmons's nicely done piece. But the story of mathematician Lise Meitner is also pretty indistinct. The best of the collection, actually, is Carl Speed McNeil's very well told and drawn story of the scientific side of Hedy Lamarr, of all people. Hedy (not Heddy) actually held some wartime patents in electronics (which became a crucial part of cell phone technology), but still was treated like a bimbo both by her first husband and by Louis B. Mayer after she escaped to the U.S. This book could have been much, much better.	2003-10-23

Because I'm a working historian with a strong interest in material culture and artifacts, combined with a tourist's interest in Civil War battlefields, I've long been a fan of Troiani's amazingly detailed, extremely accurate, almost photographic art. This gorgeous volume combines large-scale reproductions of 130 of his paintings with some 250 color photos of surviving uniforms and equipment from museums and collections around the country (including Troiani's own). After a couple hours of page-turning, I went back and spent much more time studying the depictions of units of special interest to me, such as the Washington Artillery of New Orleans and Terry's Texas Rangers. The variety in uniforms and insignia is staggering, especially compared to the &quot;uniformity&quot; of modern military uniforms. As usual, he includes extensive technical notes and specs, as well as an annotated guide to artifact collections. It's not a cheap book, but it's worth every penny.	2003-10-23

Hosler, who has a Ph.D. and specializes in neuroscience and bees, not tells a really good story about life and personalities in the hive, and is a very talented artist besides, he also manages to cram in a great deal of educational information. Icing on the cake. He starts with the birth and transformation from larva to pupa to adult of Nyuki (Japanese for \\"bee\\"), a worker who often annoys her colleague, even her older sister, Dvorah (Hebrew for \\"bee,\\" etc.). She gets lost, is almost eaten, befriends a flower named Bloomington and a dung beetle named Sisyphus, finally gets her act together (though she has to be coaxed to leave the hive again for the dangers of the outside world), and goes on to better things -- as well as a rather poetic end. The anthropomorphization is actually pretty minor, all things considered. And there's an interesting postscript about what happened when the author turned out to be allergic to bee stings. I don't know if Hosler has another insect adventure in him, but I'll be on the look-out.	2003-10-23

What &quot;A Contract with God&quot; was to the New York Jewish short story, this is to the multigenerational family saga. The 19th century was a time of heavy immigration by Ashkenazic German Jewish tradesmen and merchants from Western Europe, successors to the semi-aristocratic Sephardim of the previous century and predecessors to the poor Eastern European Jews of the 20th century. The Arnheims were part of that influx and they made their fortune and entered the ranks of the elite. Conrad, in the third generation, grows up used to the good things and not happy to find he's expected to take his father's place in the business world, nor to marry and produce heirs for the sake of the family name. And he lets his wife die in childbirth rather than lose that heir. The glamorous but frigid girl he marries second turns out to be no prize, either. His mother is a cold, calculating woman (who pressured him in the matter of his first wife), his homely eldest daughter isn't really wanted, and his younger daughter (a rebel in the 1950s) certainly doesn't get what she thinks she wants in life. The characterization and the family relationships are complex and true-to-life and it's interesting to watch as people age. This may be Eisner's masterpiece.	2003-10-19

When I was a grad student and T.A. in the '70s, I had on the wall of my office Kliban's &quot;Love to eat them mousies&quot; poster, which frequently caused passersby to stop in for a closer look. Some laughed while others just shook their heads -- which is pretty much how people have always reacted to what I regard as one of the slyest, most consistently funny cartoon artists around. While he did a lot of terrific non-cat drawings, it's for those chunky, funky cats that he's best known, and this collection should please his many fans. They're all here, too: Cats in red basketball shoes and cowboy boots, cats walking their dogs, cats pursuing mice on cross-country skis, cats feeding wieners to the birds in the park, sumo cats, cats enjoying sushi, disorganized cats competing with mice in outrigger canoes, cats playing Dixieland, cats trying on fashionable tail covers in a cat clothing store, cats painting murals, cats lounging around the campfire, and (of course) cats playing mousie-eating folksongs on the guitar. To put it simply, this is great stuff from a very talented man who died much before his time.	2003-10-19

One frequent failing of graphic novels is that even the best and most creative artists often fall down when it comes to a coherent plot. I'm happy to say that Little is both a skilled storyteller and a talented artist. (It might be fair to note, though, that he's married to novelist Myla Goldberg.) Dee is an eighteen-year-old employee of a New York City photo shop with responsibility for running the film processing machine. A pretty dull job, but she enjoys her semi-innocent hobby of making her own copies of the customers' weirder pictures, which she shares over lunch with her student friend, Lyla. Then a customer named Khatchatourian, who claims to be a crime scene photographer, brings her a roll of film featuring dead bodies, and she becomes suspicious. Dee, whose personality and style Little fleshes out very nicely, is basically a nosy person. Naturally, she embarks on a bit of amateur detective work but quickly finds herself in serious danger. Also naturally, nothing is what it seems. The supporting characters are well done, too, especially Rodney, the cabbie who also has a rock band and becames Dee's friend as well as chauffeur, and Huey, who works for Khatchatourian and has personality problems of his own. The background and the minor figures and &quot;extras&quot; who populate it are also given some individuality. I don't know if Little is planning further adventures for Dee, but I'll be watching for them.	2003-10-19
935098:US	53072811	RU5PI5KQFEG7T	1563896745	302241315	A Contract with God and Other Tenement Stories	Books	4	24	26	N	N	It was a very different world	Most of us think of Will Eisner as the creator of a terrific comic of the 1940s called The Spirit -- which he is. But we forget that in this book, first published in 1978, he also practically invented the modern &quot;graphic novel.&quot; No superheroes here, just ordinary Jewish immigrant families in a tenement building in the Bronx. There actually are four stories here. &quot;A Contract with God&quot; is the story of Frimme Hersh, who made a deal with the Almighty when he was a boy in Poland, that he would do his best in life and God should look out for him in return. He comes to America, becomes quietly successful, is respected by his neighbors and his synagogue, and things are going okay. Then his adored adopted daughter dies suddenly. God has broken the contract, and Frimme is no longer bound by it, either. It's a very satisfying, Sholom Aleichem sort of story. &quot;The Street Singer&quot; tells of an out-of-work bookkeeper during the Depression who finds he can earn a few thrown pennies singing in the allies of tenement buildings. An ex-diva decides to promote him (for her own purposes), but the money she gives him goes for booze instead. This one is interesting -- there really were street singers in New York -- but I found it much less readable. &quot;The Super,&quot; about an authoritarian German building superintendent, is a cautionary tale, sort of, about not messing with Lolitas when they come a-calling, and it's rather a lightweight piece. &quot;Cookalein,&quot; however, is a superior work, about the escape of young city-dwellers to the Adirondacks in the summer, searching for social and financial advancement through marriage. There's some delicious irony here. Eisner is generally a very good storyteller of this milieu, and he does it all in black-and-white pen work. He's a master of characterization through facial expression and other detail, and there's a reason this volume has been reprinted so many times in the past quarter century.	2003-10-19

I attended college in the Bay Area in the early `60s and have been nostalgically in love with San Francisco and Marin ever since. I spent many, many hours hiking around the city with a couple of friends, climbing the hills, exploring narrow passages between buildings, and generally gawking at the 19th century architecture. I also knew a girl whose grandmother (or aunt, or something) lived in one of the &quot;Painted Ladies&quot; on Alamo Square, the strip now known as &quot;Postcard Row,&quot; so I actually got to see the inside of one of the gorgeous homes detailed and depicted in this book. If you're not from there, you likely lump together all of San Francisco's historic domestic architecture as &quot;Victorian&quot; -- but you would be wrong. There's Gothic Revival, Italianate, Second Empire, Stick Style, Shingle Style, Queen Anne, and Colonial Revival, plus various hybrids among and later additions to all of those. Duchscherer is a longtime resident of the city and a highly regarded architectural historian and he leads the reader through the art and business behind these homes, while Keister's lush photography of busy (and occasionally overdone) Victorian interiors will have you drooling on the page. One of my personal favorites is the Westerfeld House in the Western Addition, built in 1889, which includes a fifth floor (!) tower room with an amazing view. Another is Falkirk (originally the Robert Dollar Mansion), built in San Rafael in 1888, a much more rambling Tudor extravaganza filled with a king's ransom in paneling and wainscotting; it was saved from demolition and entirely renovated (thank God) after I left the area, and I shall have to go and visit it the next time I get out there. What a book!	2003-10-10

It's not part of her long-running Richard Jury mystery series, but this droll and sparkling satire has so many facets, it's sort of difficult to write a coherent review of it. Let's do it by character: There's Paul Giverney, a best-selling author with a guaranteed million-copy sell-through -- but actually not a bad writer for all that -- and he's thinking about going with a new publisher. But before coming aboard Mackenzie-Hack, he has some conditions that involve Ned Isaly, and that's what gets everybody else's balls rolling. Ned, a writer very highly regarded by the critics, is also incredibly naive about the nuts and bolts of big-money publishing. He lives inside his current work so completely, he'd wander into traffic if his friends didn't keep an eye on him. Saul Prouil, independently wealthy and Ned's neighbor and close friend, published only one novel, a decade ago, because he just can't make himself quite finish all the books he has written since then. But that may finally change. The third writer in the trio is Jamie, a successful writer of genre fiction (any genre) who cranks out two and somethimes three novels a year. She's not &quot;literary&quot; but she's probably the hardest working of the three. And then there's the people on the publishing side, especially Bobby Mackenzie, a shark with no morals or ethics, who hires a couple of hit men to (he thinks) carry out Paul's wishes regarding Ned. And there's Clive Esterhaus, a senior editor at M-H with minimal talent but at least a conscience, and also Tom Kidd, the house's best literary editor -- the best in New York, maybe -- who can do whatever he wants because all the prize-winning authors would follow him unquestioningly to whatever publisher he chose to work for. And Sally, Tom Kidd's assistant, who has kind of a thing for Ned. And not to forget Candy and Karl, the aforementioned hit men, who have to research and approve the subject of any contract before they'll carry it out. And Mort Durban, top author's agent and general jerk, and Sammy Giancarlo, mob figure and author (now in the witness protection program in Chelsea), and even more. Even Swill's and The Old Hotel make great characters. This is simply a marvelous book which, with the right screenwriter, could also be a terrific film.

In the past decade or so, a small group of science fiction authors and editors have made a sort of cottage industry of original anthologies of alternate history stories. Some are quite good, some are exceedingly mediocre. Several in this latest collection feature both an excellent grasp of historical cause and effect and writing of high quality, including &quot;American Mandate,&quot; by Jim Fiscus, in which Gens. Smedley Butler and John Pershing find themselves trying to carry out the League of Nations mandate in the old Ottoman empire against the revolutionary forces of Mustapha Kemal. Another is Joel Richards's &quot;In the Prison of His Days,&quot; which tells of the 1916 Easter Uprising in Dublin and William Butler Yeats's part in it. &quot;George Patton Slept Here,&quot; by Roland S. Green, shows a close grasp of the details of the Italian campaign in 1943, this time led by a Patton who kept his job by managing not to slap around battle-fatigued soldiers. Chris Bunch's &quot;Tarnished Glory,&quot; on the other hand, is the sort of quasi-alternate history that just irritates the hell out of me. He has George Armstrong Custer being born in 1885 so as to take part in WWII in the Patton role -- except that Custer's buddy Patton died in the influenza epidemic of 1918 and Custer screws up in the Battle of the Bulge instead of Sicily. The thing is, you can't just snatch a historical personage out of his proper time and plunk him down otherwhen, and pretend that his personality will still be what it was! Nurture matters at least as much as nature, and context counts! Anyway. There are a couple of other stories here of particular interest, especially Michael Flynn's &quot;Southern Strategy,&quot; about a League of Nations incursion into the American South, and &quot;Devil's Bargain,&quot; in which Judith Tarr allows Richard the Lion-Hearted to succeed in his quest for Jerusalem. &quot;Horizon,&quot; by Noreen Doyle, though, is a confused and not very readable story of Akhenaten as a military conqueror, written in a style presumably meant to be reminiscent of the Book of the Dead. Susan Schwartz's &quot;And the Glory of Them,&quot; about Behemond's conquest of Antioch, portrays the 11th century king as having almost 20th century attitudes. As much as I enjoy this particular sf theme -- when it's well done --  maybe it's time we gave it a rest.Akhenaten as a military conqueror, written in a style presumably meant to be reminiscent of the Book of the Dead.

This is the first of Bushnell's books I've read, . . . which is perhaps just as well, considering the maelstrom of divergent opinions her work seems to stir up. New York is a strange world, and life there is as alien as on Saturn sometimes -- even to most of the city's inhabitants. After more than a decade of impecunious struggling to establish herself as an actress/model (indeed, as anything she can make a living at while making the splash in society she thinks is her due), the stunningly gorgeous Janey Wilcox finally has landed a contract with Victoria's Secret. Suddenly, New York is her oyster, she has some money, she has influential and wealthy friends, she's being pursued by middle-aged men with serious money. She has problems, though, like her habit of interpreting the world in a self-reassuring way, and assuming sycophants (or those who want her body) are telling her the truth and not handing her a line. The plot -- which follows Janey's progression into and through a mistake-marriage and her side adventures along the way -- is too complicated to try to detail here. But I will say that Bushnell is devastating in depicting the way the Fifth Avenue/Park Avenue Axis works and the sort of assertively self-centered people who inhabit it. The thing is, however dislikable they often might be, the characters she creates are not simple caricatures. They have reasons for being the way they are and behaving the way they do, the result of which generally is that they are both more understandable and more believable, even to those of us who will never approach within a light-year of the circles in which they move.	2003-09-20

All the stories in this collection of \\"graphic fiction\\" were written by Ottaviani, but the artwork was supplied by ten artists, including Bernie Mireault and Scott Saavedra. The stories are based on real events (reportedly real, anyway)  about Einstein, Russell, Bohr, Heisenberg, and others - and especially Richard Feynman, who was not only one of 20th century physics's major minds but an amateur locksmith, talented musician, social philosopher, and world-class storyteller as well. Some, like \\"turtles all the way down,\\" are smile-inducing classics, while others, like Heisenberg's approach to Bohr on behalf on the German nuclear effort in World War II are somber and reflective. Feynman's own recounting of his brief, tragic marriage during the Manhattan Project is especially affecting, and the tale of his safe-cracking activities at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge are a hoot. Oh, and you'll even learn some physics theory along the way, or at least get a taste of how physicists view the world. I hope another volume like this is in the works.	2003-09-20

(We used to love David Wallechinsky's The People's Almanac and Book of Lists series for the same reasons.) I mean, where else are you likely to find the color code for lighting the Empire State Building, or a schematic of Dante's Inferno, or the &quot;Victorian Timetable of Family Mourning&quot;? Some of this stuff, though, is easily available in other common sources - birth stone, the UN Secretaries General, the Fahrenheit/Celsius conversion formula, the Dewey Decimal system. And some are too incomplete or outdated or &quot;casual&quot; to be of much actual use (except to the reader who has never heard of the World Almanac): a short list of medical terminology, a handful of quotes from Winston Churchill, a list of a dozen (!) chemical compounds, and so on. Still, Schott has said that he simply collected what personally interested him - take it or leave it. Given that standard of inclusion, it's an interesting few hours' browsing.	2003-09-19

The jigsaw puzzle of fitting together individuals into family groups and demonstrable lines of descent is, for most people, the essence of genealogy. But when one begins working with lineages as early as the 10th century, one must reconsider what &quot;family&quot; means -- because a blood relationship didn't always meet the test for a titled landowner more concerned with inheritance and maintaining a power base than with warm feelings based on DNA. Bouchard is an expert in the subject of family in medieval Europe, the understanding of politics in the context of family-based marital strategies, and the transformations which the Continental aristocracy underwent around A.D. 1000. She deals with the temptation among non-genealogically trained historians to make unfounded assumptions based on name similarities, and describes how an otherwise patrilineally inclined nobleman might indeed pay more attention to his mother's lineage if hers was the more powerful family, and how best to make use of the Church's definition of incest (marriage within seven degrees of kinship) and the legal documents such an issue might create. Besides the establishment of the Rudophian dynasty in Burgundy and the Berengarians in Italy, and family power structures among the counts of Autumn, she gives special attention to the Bosonids in Provence, about whom I have not seen much other analytical work published. There is also an intriguing appendix on the &quot;problem of the three Bernards&quot; in relation to the dukes of Aquitaine in the 9th century. And the author provides not only a very thorough bibliography but more than a dozen detailed charts of the families under discussion.	2003-08-31

Probably, no one would call Hoffman's work great &quot;literature,&quot; but she certainly writes terrific books. I've read them all, over the years, and I've enjoyed them all to a greater or lesser extent, but this one may be her best. Still, it perhaps ought not to be the *first* one you read; it seems almost as though all of her previous books have led up to their culmination in The Probable Future. Hoffman has a knack for writing so matter-of-factly about magic and the supernatural as to make them seem perfectly normal, or at least acceptable, in the contemporary world. Jenny, coping with a failed marriage and holding down a boring office job in Boston, accepts her ability to dream other people's dreams. Her mother, Elinor, can always tell a liar. Her thirteen-year-old daughter, Stella, an increasingly wild child with an eye for slinky black dresses and scarlet lipstick, has to deal with the unwanted gift of seeing other people's deaths. But all the Sparrow women of Unity, Massachusetts, of whom Stella is the thirteenth generation, have some kind of gift that first appears on the morning of their thirteenth birthdays. As you learn about the three Sparrow women and the men and boys with whom their lives are entwined, you learn also about Unity, which drowned Rebecca Sparrow as a witch in the 1680s, but which all the Sparrow women have nurtured and given much of their lives to. You learn to appreciate their home, Cake House. And you learn to see how people can change completely, given the proper motivation at the right time. There's a murder in the story, too, though not a mystery, exactly; it's the catalyst that brings Stella and then Jenny back to Unity, to rediscover the directions in which their lives are destined to go. Hoffman also has a knack for spinning out descriptions of people and places in an almost 19th century way -- until Stella dyes her hair and all her clothing black, and other bits of contemporary business jar you back into the present. Magic and magical.d magical.	2003-08-22

I imagine everyone knows what a &quot;lift&quot; or a &quot;lorry&quot; is (neither of which is included in this book), but where in the world is &quot;Honkers&quot;? And what are &quot;maggies&quot; or &quot;nadgers&quot;? Having spent some time in Britain, and counting a number of Brits among my friends and colleagues, and being a student of language (I'm an editor), I'm always interested in books like this -- but this one is a decided disappointment, lacking in many areas.<br /><br />First: There are many words and phrases here that aren't exclusively, or even predominantly, British, including &quot;graft,&quot; &quot;grand&quot; (meaning a thousand dollars or pounds), &quot;gold widow,&quot; &quot;push-start&quot; (referring to an automobile), &quot;foodie,&quot; &quot;take a pew,&quot; and &quot;the mind boggles.&quot;<br /><br />Second: The author includes words that are certainly British but are not slang in any sense of the word, such as &quot;longstop&quot; and &quot;googly.&quot; These are simply technical terms in cricket -- and the author doesn't both to explain what they actually mean, or their derivation, in any case.<br /><br />Third: There are quite a few *good* inclusions for which a simple meaning is provided, but which really ought to have had more etymological detail. What *is* the &quot;spanner&quot; that gets in the works? *Why* is a convertible called a &quot;drophead&quot;? Where does the &quot;spare&quot; come from in &quot;go spare&quot;?<br /><br />Fourth: There's far too much rhyming slang in this slender volume -- maybe a third of the listings -- and the majority of them aren't even close to being &quot;contemporary,&quot; as the title claims. I ran a number of these laborered constructions past my Brit friends, and they had never heard them, either. Does *anyone* who isn't being self-consciously cute  refer to a waistcoat as a &quot;Jimmy Prescott&quot;? Does anyone outside Ascot even *wear* a waistcoat? And I note that the crude term &quot;Kermit,&quot; meaning a Frenchman (a &quot;frog,&quot; that is) is also described as rhyming slang, which it isn't.<br /><br />Fifth: I know no such compilation could ever be complete, but I was able to think almost immediately of a number of reasonably common, non-obvious terms you won't find here, such as &quot;Oz&quot; for Australia, &quot;dropsy&quot; for a bribe, and &quot;lifted&quot; for being arrested. Also, James includes &quot;go down a treat&quot; (speaking of food) but makes no mention of the more threatening (and more common) &quot;do you a treat, mate.&quot; There's no information regarding the author's background for this sort of assignment, but it can't have been much.,&quot; as the title claims.

I enjoy food and I don't mind cooking -- but, like many working people, I often don't have the time or the energy for anything elaborate. Nor do I care to eat out (or bring in) every night, even if I could afford it, so I tend to rely on a limited number of easy-to-fix dishes that I know so well, I don't even have to refer to a recipe. Stuff like spaghetti bolognese, or red beans and rice, or tuna casserole, or sloppy joes, or any of a dozen dishes involving boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Which is all well and good, but even those become boring after awhile. This inexpensive book offers quite a few appetizing solutions, all of them quick and easy, and many of them based on whatever you have on hand (assuming you take care to routinely keep certain kinds of things on hand). The ones I really like are constructed like the proverbial Chinese menu: Pick a meat from Column A, a sauce or an add-in from Column B, a veggie from Column C. Like boil some macaroni and make a skillet-dish with chopped chicken (adding Italian-style cheese, stewed tomatoes, and thmye), or ground beef (adding pepper cheese, salsa, and chili powder), or tuna (adding cheddar, sliced celery, and Italian seasoning), etc. Special attention is given (naturally) to Kraft products, but you're under no obligation.	2003-08-21

Constantine XI was the last Byzantine emperor, the last Christian ruler of what had been the Eastern Roman Empire, killed trying to defend his city against the final, successful Ottoman attack in May 1453. (Sultan Mehmed II subsequently had his head cut off, peeled off the skin, and stuffed it with straw as a trophy.) He had succeeded his childless brother to the throne less than five years before, after a career as a provincial governor -- the eighth member of his family to hold the title of emperor since Michael Palaiologos in 1253. Like Arthur in Britain and other rulers in trying times, his hero's death led inevitably to legends that he wasn't really dead, that he had escaped the fall of Constantinople, that he would be resurrected to restore the empire. It seems strange that no book has been published about Constantine XI since 1892, but Nicol, who is director of the Gennadius Library in Athens, goes far in rectifying that lack. Because the last emperor was very much a product of his family's inheritance as well as of his Graeco-Roman culture, the first half of this slender volume provides considerable information on the operation of the empire as a family business, as well as on the administrative differences between East and West in the medieval period. The later chapters relate the spread of the Palaiologi as far as Cornwall and Barbados, though these may or may not be descendants of the imperial branch of the family.	2003-08-19

I'm mostly interested in historic locations and rubbernecking generally, not in where to eat and sleep and shop for souvenirs, so the balance among types of information in the Fodor's &quot;Exploring&quot; series suits me just fine. First, there's a good general introduction on politics, recent immigration, styles &amp; trends, and London's apparent rush to knock down its history in favor of turn-of-the-21st-century garish architecture, followed by a short but equally good survey of the city's cultural and social history. At the back is a very brief guide to accommodations, dining, shopping, and &quot;travel facts,&quot; but you're usually better off with an annually updated quick guide for assistance in those areas. (Take a look at schedules and reviews in the Saturday Times and the Sunday Evening Standard, too.) It also would have been helpful to include addresses of a few of the many official and commercial trip-planning web sites for London that are now available. (Try London.Net.) The bulk of the book is organized by neighborhood -- thirteen of them, so there's quite a bit of detail wherever you might be spending your day. Sidebars throughout provide information on such things as the role of gentlemen's clubs, regularly scheduled arts festivals, and the history of &quot;Bedlam,&quot; which is exactly the kind of thing my sort of visitor finds fascinating. There are also plenty of detailed street maps, though you will definitely want to acquire a proper fold-out map, plus a London Transport map (because even native Londoners can get lost in the twistier areas). To pick nits: I wish they had included more about the Underground system and its history instead of just giving describing the fare zone system and advising you to use a Travelcard and to avoid the rush hour. And how could such a history-heavy guide omit London Stone and the Roman wall? Nevertheless, this is an excellent and well-written guide. Also, Fodor's used to skimp on photos, and what they did include were generally in black-and-white, but this volume is packed with artfully cropped and arranged pictures on heavy, slick paper.

As a freelance book editor for the past two decades, I'm one of that rather small, self-selected group of people who are likely to read grammar texts and style guides for pleasure. My copies of Follett and Patridge are well-thumbed, but I'm always willing to peruse a new effort. Bryson started out as a copyeditor for the Times of London, and was the compiler of _The Penguin Dictionary of Troublesome Words_ (of which this is actually a 2d edition), and he has a proven and felicitous writing style, so the book is both useful and a pleasure to read. Which is not to say that I don't have some nits to pick. Some of the problems he addresses are obvious, like the increasingly common disregard for the difference between &quot;its&quot; and &quot;it's,&quot; and the bugbear of ending a sentence with a preposition. Then there are less commonly discussed screw-ups that, personally, make me wince when I hear or read them, like a car having a &quot;collision&quot; with a tree, or something being in &quot;close proximity&quot; with something else, or the difference between a &quot;meteor&quot; and a &quot;meteorite,&quot; or the insistence that &quot;noisome&quot; has something to do with noise. And he handles all of those well and wittily. But many other entries seem to be spacefillers or else were carried over from a much more specialized list from his newspaper days. For instance, I've never had occasion to worry about the proper spelling of the Nullarbor Plain in Australia, or the Welsh word &quot;eisteddfod.&quot; And how many writers confuse &quot;cord&quot; and &quot;chord&quot;? And an author or editor is expected to check the spelling of names like &quot;coelacanth&quot; and Amelia &quot;Earhart&quot; and &quot;Alfa-Romeo&quot; and &quot;Meriwether&quot; Lewis anyway. I can also think of a number of commonly misused words and terms that Bryson did not include, and for which a discussion would have been useful, such as the colloquial use of &quot;ain't,&quot; and why &quot;bugbear&quot; has nothing to do with wildlife. I won't be adding this one to my ready-reference shelf, but it's worth a read.ot;bugbear&quot; has nothing to do with wildlife.

Ten years ago, many of us were concerned that the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union would also spell the end of Le Carr&eacute;'s masterful stories of international subterranean intrigue and mischief. We needn't have worried. We forgot that that there's just as much venality and disregard for law and civilization in the West as there ever was in the East. Le Carr&eacute;'s earlier work has reached its inevitable end, but the saga of George Smiley has been succeeded, if not replaced, by a series of individual tales featuring characters like (in this one) Nat Brock of the Customs Service, pursuer of the launderers of illicit offshore wealth in the hands of drug lords, arms dealers, and the Russian Mafia. The laundry being the House of Single, under the proprietorship of &quot;Tiger&quot; Single, who expects his surviving son and junior partner, Oliver, to someday succeed him. Oliver becomes closely acquainted with the Orlov brothers and their billion-dollar schemes, learns to fear the Georgians and their henchmen, and finds his view of the House of Single changing more than he would like. Being young and recently called to the law, he can take only so much before he peaches to the authorities in the person of Brock. And Brock, who can barely contain his glee, trains the young turncoat in undercover work and puts him back in his father's House as a mole. This is not quite what Oliver had in mind and, after causing his father considerable financial grief, he finally flees the whole scummy mess, preferring to hide out in a seaside resort as a children's party clown and magician. Then the Russians become more than Tiger, in his straitened circumstances, can successfully deal with, and Oliver is swept up in the acceleration of events. As always, Le Carr&eacute;'s characters are four-dimensional and utterly believeable. His narrative proceeds on several lines at once, in both the past and the present, which will keep you busy sorting out what has happened and guessing what is about to happen. This is his best work in several years.ened and guessing what is about to happen. This is his best work in several years.	2003-08-15

While I'm aware of who the author is, I've never read any of his stuff, having a very limited interest in fiction about World War II. But this one caught my eye because I definitely *do* have an interest in historical novels about the ancient world. Martinus Harinxma, Dutch oceangoing tugboat captain and the protagonist of several of De Hartog's earlier books, is now in irascible retirement in the south of France, driving his wife and grown kids crazy, unable quite to come to grips with the lack of physical action seemingly incumbent on a man in his seventies. On a trip to Canada and the U.S., he somehow gets involved with dowsing and turns out to have a great knack for it. His wife suggests he combine his new-found talent with his longstanding interest in Roman military history, which leads them both on a sort if guided tour of southwest England in the present -- and also sixteen hundred years ago. Praepositus (Colonel) Mellarius, adopted son of the centurion of the title (the old man with whom Martinus seems to be linked), leaves the Rhine in the summer of 368 A.D. as part of an expedition to pacify a revolt in Britain, a campaign which will lead him to question his lethal way of life and which will end up being the death of him for political reasons. We watch the Colonel's weary trek while learning a good deal about the *real* and thoroughly unglamourous life of the middle-rank Roman army at a time when Christianity was becoming a major (and generally detrimental) influence on the empire and its governing institutions. And we watch while the Dutchman in 1987 asks the wrong questions of his pendulum, misinterprets the visions he receives, and refuses to believe anything that goes against his own prejudices. This book is somewhat more than that surface story, though. Mellarius and Martinus are each on their own quests, to \\"find themselves,\\" as we used to say, to figure out where they belong in their respective worlds. The Colonel worries about having been an insufficiently good son to the adopted father he literally worships, while the tug captain worries about having been an inadequate father through all his lengthy absences at sea. De Hartog's style is one of simple narrative combined with highly evocative description, but he certainly understands character, as well as Roman Britain.iciently good son to the adopted father he literally worships, while the tug captain worries about having been an inadequate father through all his lengthy absences at sea.

For the past couple of years, I've been re-reading all the earlier Tim Powers novels -- the yarns that got me hooked on his writing in the first place. He has a way of interweaving tidbits of &quot;real&quot; history with fantasy and mythology, resulting in a &quot;secret history&quot; novel that can have you questioning what's *really* real. In this one, John Chandagnac, son of an itinerant French puppeteer, most recently a bookkeeper in London, discovers that his late father's brother is a wealthy merchant in Port-au-Prince because he embezzled the elder brother's inheritance. John intends to journey to Haiti, get his late father's money back, and see his crooked uncle hang. And the transatlantic voyage is made more enjoyable by meeting young Beth Hurwood and her father, a one-armed Oxford don. But then life takes a turn. The merchant vessel is waylaid by pirates -- and Hurwood turns out to be in league with them. John is pressed into the pirate crew, is renamed &quot;Jack Shandy,&quot; and discovers why Blackbeard twisted smoldering slow-match in his hair and beard. Then the plot really starts to move, with pirates who make everyday use of voodoo (now virtually extinct in the Old World), and a quest for the Fountain of Youth, and a quest to rescue Beth from her father's evil designs, and a renewed quest to even the score with his uncle Sebastian. The last third of the book is narrated at a dead run, as everything comes together and explanations are made for some of the story's more puzzling earlier events. And Jack's skill as a puppeteer comes in very useful indeed. This is one of Powers's best.	2003-07-31

I read almost every non-manga graphic novel I can find, so I have a basis for comparison when I say that their quality adheres to the classic bell curve. Some are pretty good, some a pretty bad, but the majority are merely mediocre -- and this interesting but confused effort fits right in the middle of the pack. &quot;100 Bullets&quot; is apparently an ongoing series of which this is just one installment, but I haven't seen the others, so I can only say that the set-up -- the old man with an attache case containing a pistol and a hundred guaranteed untraceable slugs for it -- doesn't make a whole lot of sense. And about one-third of the way through, the attache case ceases to have any part in the story anyway. So what do we have? We have Milo Garrett (whose name actually might be Lewis), a faceless, alcoholic private detective with a bad attitude who like to start fights. &quot;Faceless&quot; literally, because he was in a car wreck and has his face swathed in bandages for most of the book. Then there's an art theft, a number of murders, a number of bad guys -- badder than Milo, that is -- and a lot of sometimes well-written dialogue and interior monologue that borrows heavily from Raymond Chandler. While the separate scenes are usually pretty well done, the overall plot, as noted, wanders all over the place. I never have quite figured out what the ending meant. The design and drawing, while eye-catching, isn't all that original. So, a very average piece of work.	2003-07-30

As a food-lover, I especially enjoyed his culinary pieces, since collected in three volumes beginning with American Fried in 1974. The last, Third Helpings, appeared in 1983, so it's been along dry spell, but now he's back with a new series of adventures that will make you salivate. The chapter in which he tries to get his daughter to promise she'll move back to New York from San Francisco if he can find a dependable source of pumpernickel bagels makes him sound Manhattan-centric, but he also writes a paean to boudin (which, even living in south Louisiana, I confess I don't care for at all), and another to the posole found in Taos (which I like very much). And there's a chapter on nutria sauce piquante that's a real hoot (think sheep-sized rodents). And there's San Francisco burritos, and Casamento's oyster loaf, and fried fish in Barbados, and pimientos in Galicia, and a number of other foodstuffs to be considered. This is a great book to read when you're sitting in the staff room at work, munching mindlessly on a homemade tuna sandwich and a bag of Fritos.	2003-07-30

Like most, this one is a mix of genuinely interesting information (&quot;How to hire a contractor&quot; is good, as is &quot;How to conduct like Toscanini&quot;), misguided or inadequately informed recommendations (&quot;How to make great grilled chicken&quot; is simply a recipe for beer can chicken, which isn't at all the same thing), and tongue-in-cheek throwaways. (Under &quot;How to become a billionaire,&quot; you find J. Paul Getty's line: &quot;Rise early. Work late. Strike oil.&quot; Droll, but not useful.)

And &quot;How to ace an interview&quot; assumes you're an executive (or new B-school grad) trying out for a standardized corporate position, with very little relevancy for those of us in civil service or academia, to say nothing of applicants at Microsoft. &quot;How to train a basset hound&quot; is obviously a humorous paean to the author's pet, drawings of whose mug are scattered throughout the book.

What got my attention, actually, was not so much the question of whether or not Europeans (or Phoenicians, or Africans, or the Chinese) visited or explored or colonized the Western Hemisphere before 1492 -- though I do find that a fascinating problem -- but rather the open warfare in the historical profession between the diffusionists and the &quot;independent development&quot; people on this issue. Historians who on any other problem could disagree, state their reasons, and go on to the next point of debate, become dogmatic and vitriolic over the question of whether Columbus was the first or simply the latest non-Amerind to wander to the New World -- what has been called the NEBC, or &quot;No Europeans Before Columbus&quot; principle. When I first heard about this massive bibliography, I was two minds: I wanted to see what had been published that I might have missed, but I also had had vague thoughts of publishing such a work myself some day, perhaps accompanied by an extended essay on the history of the historiographical brouhaha. On the other hand, these two volumes cover more than 5,100 books, articles, and papers, and my own list includes &quot;only&quot; a little more than half that number, so I doublt I'll ever catch up.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed, though, is that Research Press is the publishing arm of the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies. We all know that the Latter-Day Saints take as an article of faith the ancient migration of certain Israelite groups to the Americas, even considering them the progenitors of the American &quot;Indians&quot; (against all anthropological sense, I have to add), so is there a predisposition here to one side of the argument? Well, having worked my way through the majority of the annotations, I'm relieved to say that does not appear to be the case -- even though the authors were at BYU when they began this project. The coverage and the annotatations both seem evenly balanced.<br /><br />While the annotations themselves vary greatly in length, detail, and utility, they don't seem to left out any books that I am familiar with, except for those 19th century publications which apparently don't meet the current standards of scholarship (but which are of interest to me for different reasons, as noted above). They even included what they call &quot;weird&quot; publications, though passing on Atlantis and VanDanikenesque speculations (which is okay by me). They do say they deliberately excluded newspaper articles because of the difficulty of locating copies -- though I have scores of photocopies in my files from the popular press over the past 150 years, mostly obtained with no difficulty though Inter-Library Loan.<br /><br />My major complaint with this project, and I say this as a professional book-indexer and editor of two decades' experience, is the very poor index. Sorenson goes to some length in describing how they compiled it (with their word processing software, apparently), but he seems not to understand the difference between &quot;index&quot; and &quot;concordance.&quot; Using such terms as &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;transpacific&quot; and &quot;diffusion,&quot; and then following each with as many as several hundred undifferentiated locators is pretty useless.

(A book on writing style isn't going to teach you how to type first.) That nitpick aside, the Kovels walk you through the basics of the online auction world, especially Yahoo, Amazon, and (naturally) eBay. Most of their examples have to do with egg plates and Limoges and other Kovels specialties, but their recommendations on writing lot descriptions and headlines are excellent marketing. They also strongly recommend the use of escrow services as protection against \\"buyer's remorse\\" and credit card fraud, which I have to agree with -- at least when the amount of money involved becomes substantial. The \\"Buyer's Diary\\" and \\"Seller's Diary\\" sections will be familiar to anyone who bought and sold on eBay more than a few times, too! On the other hand, nobody I know uses a Polaroid these days instead of a digital camera, so some parts of this book are quickly sliding out of date. As long as you note the word \\"basic\\" in the title, this is a reasonably useful and well-written book, though only one among many.	2003-07-24

Several reviews I've read online of Silverberg's latest work compare it to Bruce Sterling's recent _Years of Rice and Salt,_ implying that somehow Silverberg \\"stole\\" Bruce's idea of a grand alternate history progressing from ancient times to our (alternate) present. This is simply silly, since all of these stories except the \\"Prologue\\" were published previously, several in anthologies, though most of them are somewhat changed in this volume to aid the historical and narrative flow. I very much enjoyed Bruce's book, but neither of these guys has to lift ideas from the other, believe me. Anyway. The Point of Departure -- as Alt Hist buffs refer to the crucial dividing line between our \\"real\\" history and what might plausibly have happened -- is the failure of the Hebrews to escape from Eqypt under the leadership of Moses. Which means no chance for Christianity to develop. (I'm sure the fundamentalists out there will accordingly regard this book as blasphemous. . . .) Silverberg takes this to mean that Rome has the opportunity to continue as a world power indefinitely. Not that the Empire doesn't have its ups and downs, though, its good and bad centuries. After Constantine founds Constantinople and divides the Empire between Western and Eastern emperors, the stage is set for a Latin-Greek tug-of-war that will last for two millennia and several of the stories are about various stages in that rivalry. The best of these, I think, is \\"Waiting for the End,\\" in which Rome, having wasted its substance on a disasterous series of attempts to conquer the New World, is simply outflanked by the Byzantines and the final, but quiet, fall of the Urbs Roma is witnessed by a Romanized Greek bureaucrat and his girlfriend. \\"Via Roma,\\" about the bloody establishment of a Second Roman Republic, is also very good, and so is \\"A Hero of the Empire,\\" in which a minor Roman official in Arabia Deserta has to decide what to do about a potentially dangerous rabble-rouser named Mahmoud. But there's a problem with setting stories in the far future of a world in which the Point of Departure occured in its distant past: Much of the enjoyment in reading stories like this is in seeing what happened to figures from our own timeline had circumstances been even a bit different. (E.g., Lincoln survives the assassination attempt, is later impeached, and retires to Chicago.) Once you get a few centuries down the line, though, the divergence is so great that all the characters are pure fiction with no connection to our own world, and you lose much of the \\"alternate history\\" aspect. That's what happens with most of the later stories in this volume. They're generally quite good *as stories* but the \\"what if\\" ingredient becomes pretty thin.a problem with setting stories in the far future of a world in which the Point of Departure occured in its distant past: Much of the enjoyment in reading stories like this is in seeing what happened to figures from our own timeline had circumstances been even a bit different.

This anthology centers on an interesting idea but the execution is problematical. The set-up is in the introductory story: If you can locate a few scraps of DNA from any deceased individual -- Leonardo da Vinci, Anne Boleyn, your own father -- the personality of that person can be \\"injected\\" into you by broadcasting it into your eye and thereby into your brain. Scarborough never goes very far into just how this is done, which is okay. She's much more interested in exploring the effects of having another personality either piggy-backing your own or being fully integrated into yours. So a modern-day inventor enamoured of perpetual motion uploads Leonardo, but is distracted when he begins to view the rest of the world through the eyes of a Renaissance man. Or,  a shallow tycoon acquires the skills of an Elizabeth fencing master so he can show off at the local SCA faire, but hasn't expected the Elizabethan religious values that accompany them. All the stories are pretty much like that, the moral apparently being that you never get quite what you expect to get. (Sounds kind of like Forrest Gump. . . .) There are some very professional writers here, including Elizabeth Moon, Kristine Rusch, and Carole Nelson Douglas, which makes the generally mediocre plotlines and two-dimensional characterizations especially disappointing.	2003-07-21

It's hard to know how to write a review of such a strange and disturbing book. I can start with the \\"abouts.\\" It's about a convicted pedophile and killer who has been in prison in upstate New York for twenty-three years, a deeply bent personality, but also a tragic figure. He's nameless, an untrustworthy narrator with a confused memory of events and a sometimes very shaky grasp on reality. It's also about Alice, his twelve-year-old victim, who may have been to some extent complicit in her own death -- if the narrator's tale is to be believed. And it's about a college girl, also nameless, who corresponds with the prisoner, describing her own pedophilic activities and asking his advice -- although it's unclear how much of what she tells him actually happened, how much is her imagination, and how much is simply *his* imagination. Homes does an astonishing job of leading the reader to question what \\"normal\\" really means, and her masterful control of the narrative brings out the distasteful depths of all the characters. There are no \\"heroes\\" in this book, believe me -- not even the narrator when he wreaks a satisfying revenge on a tormentor in the shower. In many ways, to many readers, this will be a horror story, but the truly horrifying thing is that it could very easily all be true.	2003-07-18

Consider a sort of libertarian, sort of syndicalist near-future world in which voluntary combines -- \\"ad-hocs\\" -- run everything by internal consensus and personal reputation -- \\"Whuffie\\" -- is apparently the only medium of exchange. Moreover, through advanced methods of human cloning and the ability to back up one's personality and memory, personal immortality is practically guaranteed -- after a fashion. Jules is part of that world, still a young man at more than a century of age, and a resident and cast member at World Disney World. He's been accepted into the ad-hoc that runs Liberty Square and he has a very satisfying relationship with Lil, born in the Park and an expert in the Hall of Presidents and the Haunted Mansion. But the purity of the rides is threatened by a very high-tech ad-hoc fresh from Disney World Beijing, and Jules tries to lead a fight to defend the status quo -- even though he gets murdered by the opposition, which really makes him angry. All in all, this is a fun read with an appealing style and a lot of intriguing ideas, though the author glosses over far too much to make the establishment of this world believable. For one thing, the Powers That Be of the early 21st century would never allow the revolutionary Bitchun Society to simply take over a university by socio-philosophical pressure, as Doctorow describes; the national guard (or the Canadian equivalent) would be called out and the gutters would run with blood. Neal Stephenson or Bruce Sterling would have done a much better job of this. Perhaps, since the book only runs 200 pages anyway, Doctorow should have worked at it a while longer.	2003-07-13

First of all, I have a problem with the notion of becoming an \\"instant expert\\" in *any* field, merely by reading a single, rather slender book. And, since this volume is tall and narrow (presumably to fit in one's inside coat pocket), its 136 pages really equal only about 70 pages -- less than that if you discount the large amount of space consumed by b/w reproductions of color book covers, which don't add much value, either. Second of all, the opening chapter is devoted to cover art rather than the contents of the books, which seems odd. I personally own quite a few large-format volumes of the work of sf artists whom I admire, but I'm a reader first -- and some of the best novels have had terrible cover art, including those of Asimov and Le Guin, and the hardcover edition of Harlan Ellison's _Dangerous Visions._ Next, the author's list of \\"15 top collectible authors\\" does not include founders of the genre like Hugo Gernsback, but does include folks like Joe Lansdale. My inherited copy of _Ralph 124C41+_ had a lot to do with my discovery of science fiction as a kid, and I expect other old-timers could say the same -- and while I like Joe's stuff, his popularity is based primarily on his Elmore-Leonard-like East Texas crime novels, not on his small early output of science fiction. Then Lovisi refers to \\"about a thousand other fine writers who are also very collectible,\\" with the implication that collecting should be a function of market value, not of one's personal fannish interests -- an attitude with which most serious book collectors would strongly disagree. The author does have some useful things to say about the budgeting of one's collection purchases, and about standards of condition, and he provides a short list of terminology, but these apply to collecting in *any* field. I already know all those things; I picked up this book to see what it had to say about collecting science fiction and fantasy specifically. The most useful section of the book -- it takes up more than one-third of it -- is the \\"Brief History of Collecting Paperback SF/F/H,\\" which gives a very good overview of a highly idiosyncratic field. (Hence, the two stars.) Throughout the book, Lovisi seems to equate \\"science fiction\\" with \\"paperback\\" (not even \\"original paperback\\"), but nowhere on the cover or the back copy is this limitation specified -- even though authors like Lovecraft and Leinster are far more valuable in hardcover. Finally, the author's quoted market prices are way off the mark: He claims a price of $165, for instance, for _Neuromancer_ but a quick online check shows several fine paperbacks for half that, while the first hardcover edition goes for $1,000 and up. Maybe we could get someone like Barry Levin to write a *proper* book on collecting science fiction. . . .more than one-third of it -- is the \\"Brief History of Collecting Paperback SF/F/H,\\" which gives a very good overview of a highly idiosyncratic field.

Carolyn Cherryh has the true storyteller's knack of being able to approach a huge, sprawling, complexly plotted yarn in terms of its constituent characters and events. But where _Downbelow Station_ -- which you really ought to have read in order to grasp all the back-story and milieu of this future -- is a tangled skein, _Merchanter's Luck_ is a single twist of two threads. Sandor Kreja is the only surviving member of the trading family that operated and lived aboard LUCY, a down-at-the-heels merchant ship not unlike a tramp steamer, carrying small cargoes and unfussy passengers and getting by on the margins of life. Allison Reilly, on the other hand, is a promising member of the large, wealthy mercantile family that inhabits DUBLIN AGAIN, a name to be reckoned with and respected among the stations whose ports it frequents. But that's just the problem: The Reilly family is *too* large. Allison is likely to be on rejuv herself by the time she climbs the advancement ladder far enough to be able to sit the bridge. They meet happenstantially, Sandy is completely taken with the tall, beautiful, regal Allie, and when DUBLIN goes off to Pell on the next leg of her trading loop among the stations, he pilots LUCY through a series of jumps singlehandedly in order to follow her. One thing leads to another, and when his past, checkered like that of all marginers, leads to potential major troubles with the Alliance and with the ominous Captain Mallory of the warship NORWAY (a shivver-provoking force in _Downbelow Station_), Allie jumps in to help him -- and, not incidentally, herself -- by leaving her family with a few like-minded cousins and making a crew for LUCY. But now, Sandor has to learn to trust others with his ship and its ghosts, and the Dubliners have to learn to trust someone who's not one of them. Cherryh is also expert at divulging her characters' minds and motivations through telling detail, so everyone you'll meet here is fully realized. And their story becomes the kind of tale merchanters, and even stationers, will tell each other for many years in the portside bars of Pell and Viking.he kind of tale merchanters, and even stationers, will tell each other for many years in the portside bars of Pell and Viking.	2003-07-09

In this third volume of his slightly rambling but always fascinating and well-informed discussions of books, book collectors, booksellers and dealers, and all the periperal subjects they engender, he combines advice on bibliophily in the age of the Internet with reminiscence on how collecting used to be done, and what the old and the new still have in common. As a small-time collector of limited resources myself, I enjoy reading abut the fabulous collections built up by those who not only have money to spend but also the intelligence and passion to add value to what they hunt down and acquire by adding to the accretion of knowledge. In fact, as Basbanes makes clear, becoming personally involved with books and other &quot;stuff&quot; is what separates collectors from mere accumulators. In fact, I find I have also become a collector of Nick Basbanes. . . .	2003-07-06

In this terrific sequel to Sloppy Firsts, Jess Darling alternately barrels and wanders through her senior year at Pineville High School, unsure where she's going to college, unsure whether she should keep running track, unsure whether she'll ever be able to talk to her parents, unsure whether she'll ever have a boyfriend she can deal with successfully (and lose her virginity to). Paul Parlipiano introduces her to Columbia, which entrances her -- but the events of September 11 throw her into a turmoil about moving to New York. She finds herself somehow hooked up with co-Brainiac Len Levy -- but he gets highjacked by the class whore. She's drawn ever more strongly to the apparently reformed Marcus Flutie -- but can she trust him, given his manipulative history? Things turn out okay, of course, but McCafferty gives nothing away until it happens, creating fully-formed four-dimensional characters who will keep you involved in the story. It seems unlikely there will be a third volume to this series, since Jessica is entering a whole new chapter in her life (having firmly shut the door on the old one), but I'll be interested to see what the author turns to next.	2003-07-04

Four hundred recipes culled from several thousand community cookbooks, which are an excellent source for \\"real\\" recipes, as opposed to the elitist, artsy concoctions of chefs in expensive restaurants. I.e., this is the sort of regional comfort food I not only like to eat, but am also capable of preparing: Peach Cobbler, Pecan Pie, Country-Fried Steak, Honey-Baked Chicken, and all that good stuff. On the other hand, I'm really not an okra person (my wife is), and I have no use at all for greens of any kind. But you'll also find Curried Chicken Salad, Three-Pepper Frittata, Orange Hummus here, none of which I would consider \\"Southern.\\" The Beer and Tomato Hush Puppies turned out really good, and so did the idea of making French toast with English muffins (never thought of that). Shrimp Manale (with garlic and white wine) is a very simple dish, but excellent, and the Catfish Classique, made with vermouth, whipping cream, and chopped scallions, was a very interesting take on a South Louisiana staple. I don't know about making \\"quick\\" beignets from frozen dinner rolls, though. I got this book from the library, but I think I'm going to have to buy my own copy.	2003-07-02

I've enjoyed the author's four \\"Dr. Zeus, Inc.\\" novels -- well, the first three considerably more than the most recent one -- but this volume is an example of the truism that short stories often don't work as well as novel-length on the same subject. First, you definitely have to have read the novels to make head or tail of some of these stories, so I'm not sure what the readers made of them in their original magazine appearances. Second, there actually are only ten Company stories in this collection, the other four being what seem to be the first installments (first I've seen, anyway) in a new series about an apparent non-homo sapiens named Alec Checkerfield -- which really are pretty good, though Baker leaves a lot of unanswered questions. (I think \\"Monster Story\\" is the best of the four.) Having said all that, though, I'll admit that when Baker gets in the groove, she can really tear up the page! \\"The Queen in Yellow,\\" which is new for this volume and may be the best thing here, is a mile-a-minute semi-slapstick piece featuring Literature Preservationist Lewis and his attempt to recover ancient Egyptian manuscripts out from under the nose of Flinders Petrie, who is almost too much for him. \\"Studio Dick Drowns Near Malibu,\\" which is also pretty good, is a more romantic story about Facilitator Joseph's latest faked death and the way in which he deals with a young woman's attempted suicide (though she seems awfully naive). \\"The Hotel at Harlan's Landing\\" has a nice Twilight Zone flavor. On the other hand, \\"The Wreck of the Gladstone\\" is rather weak -- and why is it dedicated to Harlan Ellison, when it seems to bear no resemblance to any of his work? And \\"Facts Relating to the Arrest of Dr. Kalugin,\\" which features all new characters, is just confusing. Well, I'll be waiting with curiosity for the next book in the novel series.	2003-07-02

Anyone seriously interested in the American Civil War ends up with a sizable shelf of reference volumes, and this one should be on that shelf. After an introductory year-by-year summary of campaigns and major battles (easily found in many other sources), he discusses the organization, weapons, formal tactics, and actual practices for each branch of the service. This includes such uncommon units as the Mississippi Marine Brigade and the Indian Home Guards. Where else are you going to find the details of each state militia's formation and organization, both North and South, not to mention the standard uniform? Everything here is exemplified in hundreds of period photos with excellent captions (especially useful for militia uniforms), and there are numerous excerpts from personal reports, diaries, memoirs, and regimental histories. Katcher also includes short biographies of major military figures, each accompanied by a portrait (not the same ones you'll find in _Generals in Blue_ and _Generals in Gray_). And there are footnotes and short bibliographies throughout. An excellent ready-reference tool.	2003-07-02

This is McCafferty's first published novel, and the field obviously has a new rising star.

She's also minus her best friend, who has moved to small-town Tennessee, leaving Jess without allies in the struggles of adolescence. Her three other longtime friends are shallow, skanky, and socially calculating; she loathes them but still hangs out with them, in preference to being even lonelier than she already is. Her computer-professional, bicycle-addicted father seems to be interested only in her athletic performance, while her twin-setted Mom can think only of her eldest daughter's impending wedding.

Francis Xavier Meehan (known always as &quot;Meehan&quot;) is a felon and a recidivist. (&quot;That's what they'll put on my tombstone, 'Francis Meehan, Recidivist'.&quot;) He's also very bright and an autodidact, mostly because there's lots of time to read in jail. This time, he's awaiting federal changes for having highjacked a truck he didn't know was carrying the U.S. Mail, and he's definitely not looking forward to federal time. So he's cautiously interested when a politician from the president's reelection campaign committee comes to see him about engaging his professional burglary skills to recover a &quot;package&quot; that could damage the president's chances and which is presently in the possession of the Other Side. The problem is, as Meehan lays his plans and tries to set up a team to do the job, nobody in Washington can keep their mouths shut. Jeffords, the political contact, is a hoot. Goldfarb, Meehan's lawyer, is another one. And Meehan himself is a trove of highly quotable dialogue and observations, espeically when it comes to the Ten Thousand Rules. Like many (perhaps most) of Westlake's yarns, this would make a pretty good film, too.	2003-06-30

In theory, this is a terrific idea for a library ready-reference book: pages and pages of lists of every kind and classification of thing you can imagine. The design and execution is a good deal more problematic, however. Some of the selected topics are obvious -- Roman and Japanese emperors, weights and measures, the Ten Commandments, Newton's Laws of Motion -- but many others (I'm tempted to say &quot;most others&quot;) are not in any way hierarchical and are seldom naturally structured. In fact, they often seem artificial and arbitrary, meant only to fill up space to produce a book large enough to market. At the least, they strain the rubric. For example: &quot;Circus attractions&quot; is just a incomplete collection of types of acts; &quot;Employee benefits&quot; is merely one sample list; &quot;Motion picture genres&quot; includes an apparently arbitrary forty-one types of films (who says?); likewise the &quot;areas&quot; of the performing arts; likewise the topics in a household budget. And why is the list of topics used in the _Macmillan Visual Dictionary_ a valid universal list? Finally, even some of topics I personally would have considered obvious are omitted, like a list of the traditional logical fallacies. If you remember the Wallaces' highly idiosyncratic and very browsable _Book of Lists_ series from the 1970s, . . . well this is nothing like that. Finally, it pains me to observe that the book's designer saw fit to commit the amateurish font-sin of setting the titles of publications in the blurbs on the back cover in ALL SWASH.	2003-06-27

This volume of essays is a delight for anyone (like me) with overlapping interests in American material culture and the American Civil War. Following two general introductory essays, there are ten case studies on specific sites, each by the local expert. These include Maryland Heights at Harpers Ferry, naval wrecks in the James River, Camp Nelson in Tennessee, Cheat Summit Fort in West Virginia, the Hatcher-Cheatham family site near Richmond (including Drewry's Bluff), and the Parrott Foundry at West Point. There's also a discussion of how Civil War sites are to be best memorialized. All the authors make it clear that trophy-collectors with metal detectors are not archaeologists! Interpretation is more important than mere digging. Recording where spent bullets tended to cluster at a battlefield, for instance, helps make clear the position of specific units and aids our understanding of the sequence of the action. There's also an implied warning regarding the social vulnerability of many recently excavated sites as a result of unencumbered development. I know Geier has a new volume of essays out, and it's on my to-read list, . . . but I do wish he'd do an up-to-date overall survey of Civil War archaeology.	2003-06-27

To put it very simply, this first novel is an extraordinary piece of work, a true tour de force. It's about a Jesuit expedition to the first inhabited world other than our own, newly discovered -- but that's not *really* what it's about. Russell is a highly trained anthropologist, cross-educated in many other related disciplines, all of which she draws upon masterfully to tell the story of Father Emilio Sandoz, S.J., and the other members of the exploratory party. The two societies of Rakhat are very, very well thought out and depicted and that world is entirely consistent and believable -- because she also knows when more detail would be too much -- but it's the party from Earth that holds our attention, the beautifully developed complexities of their personalities and interrelationships, the humane ways in which they learn to function as a group, to love each other. And the reader cares very much when things happen to them -- and things do indeed happen. But even they are not the most important concern of the story, which is the nature of belief in God, the search for and acceptance of God, and what happens when that acceptance is betrayed by God. And, on top of all that, Russell is a very highly accomplished stylist, a master of plot and pacing, a poet of considerable talent. There's a sequel, but I almost hesitate to pick it up. Could she possibly produce something so marvelous twice?	2003-06-24

Not super hero stuff (except for Moore's Watchmen, of course) but \\"real\\" stories set in the present or past. Reasonably real, anyway. This one is a high-Victorian adventure involving such literary greats as Alan Quartermain (fallen on hard times as a result of drug-dependence), Capt. Nemo (here interpreted as a renegade from the Subcontinent), the Invisible Man (a deeply sociopathic character), and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (suffering from a bipolar disorder of some magnitude), all of whom are collected Wilhelmina Murray, who has reverted to her maiden name following an unnamed horrible experience the previous year. She working under the instructions of Mr. Bond and \\"M\\" (who is suspected of being Mycroft Holmes, . . . but that initial can stand for a number of things), who are trying to save the world from the criminal use of cavorite. I often find that in even the best graphic novel, the story is not nearly as well produced as the artwork, and that's also the case here -- but the discrepancy is rather small this time. And the art is very well done indeed, especially the flow from one panel to the next and the use of slight changes in facial expression or body language to make a point. There are some really lovely details, too, like the bad guys in corsets. I shall waiting with anticipation for the next volume.	2003-06-21

Nowadays, one has to keep track of where best to find the answers to questions on the Web, as well. And it ain't easy! Massive printed volumes of Web addresses weren't much help even a decade ago because they were indiscriminate and seldom included annotations. What we needed -- and still need -- are a few collections of a (relatively) few carefully selected germane Web sites with the reasons given for their inclusion. And this discriminating and well thought out guide is the best one I've seen yet. It's intended mostly for the professional information broker or commercial researcher-for-hire, but librarians in any large public or academic library system do much the same sort of thing and will profit enormously by reading it. After an excellent introduction to the principles of online research, it's divided into topical sections: government resources, public records, news sites, business tools, and international (i.e., non-U.S.) research. Then there are several sections on managing and filtering what you find, how to evaluate its credibility and utility, and privacy concerns. Schlein spends considerable time on fee-based and &quot;hidden&quot; resources, too, not just the freebies on the public Web. Some of the sites he recommends I was already aware of, but there are many others I hadn't run across before. And I have been recommending his advice on search strategies and information massaging to my colleagues. There are a couple of annoying things about this otherwise superior book, however. One is the need for much, much tighter copyediting -- like saying &quot;the software can be moderated&quot; when they meant &quot;modified,&quot; and the sometimes eccentric punctuation, and the tendency to break Web addresses in peculiar places (letting only the last character of &quot;.html&quot; fall to the next line gives you a quite different address). The other annoyance is a tendency by the author to laud (frequently) any book published by his editors, associates, or advisors -- so much so that it becomes embarrassing. But given the high quality of the book's actual content, I suppose I can live with that.line gives you a quite different address).

I retired five years ago after thirty years in a very large public library system, and recently found it necessary to return to the trenches for awhile, in a rather smaller system. In that half-decade, of course, the Internet changed drastically and, even though I'm constantly online and intimately familiar with the major search engines (and many of the minor ones), there was a large number of new reference information sources with which I was not at all familiar. So I went looking for professional tools to remedy my ignorance. This is the first book I've seen in the publisher's &quot;CyberAge&quot; series, and medthodologically, it's quite good. As others have noted, the static nature of print-on-paper means rapidly outdated material, but Sherman and Price show you how to attack the problem, so, even though I came across several (unfortunately) extinct databases, I was able to locate several new ones, too. This is a terrific instructional work for reference librarians, and the accompanying web site is near the top of my bookmarks at work.	2003-06-12

The shorter pieces in this volume originally appeared in _The Third Level_ and _I Love Galesburg in the Springtime,_ and have been reprinted many times elsewhere, as well, but they're still perfect reading for that warm summer Sunday afternoon in the hammock. The &quot;furniture&quot; in these stories -- the social commentary, the cultural backdrop of the 1950s -- may seem rather dated, but all of them share a wistfulness that transcends the period in which they were written. In &quot;The Coin Collector&quot; (also published as &quot;The Woodrow Wilson Dime&quot;), a man finds an odd bit of coinage in his pocket change, an artifact of a closely parallel world, in which he married a different girl and took a different job, and in which Mark Twain wrote another Huck Finn novel. He finds it all very exciting -- for a while. &quot;Of Missing Persons&quot; is about the opportunity to *really* get away from it all, and how to blow your only chance. &quot;The Third Level&quot; is about being able to catch a train back into a quieter, happier past. One definitely gets the impression that Finney would rather have been anywhere else than the mid-20th century -- a feeling most of us probably share from time to time, but we forget that the &quot;Good Old Days&quot; never really happened. So these stories might be considered naive -- but still, they're very pleasant reading.	2003-06-10

I first read this lovely, lyrical invention of urban rock n' roll fantasy when Emma was pretty much an unknown quantity, a California transplant in Minnesota writing and singing with Cats Laughing. While she has (unfortunately) never quite hit the Big Time, she spawned a number of imitators. But she still does it better than anyone. Eddi is a full-time rocker, a rhythm guitarist with the gift of musical poetry. She's also just the mortal the forces of Faerie need to bring death to their hidden wars, fought in the parks and by the streams of Minneapolis. To protect her between battles from their equally magical opponents, the Seelie Court sends a phouka, a tricksy sprite who moves into her life and eventually into her heart. But this is more than just a fairy tale: It's a story of art and the people who create it, the band Eddi builds with the help of two fey musicians, and the magical power she herself acquires. The characters are richly drawn and fully realized and Emma's ability to put the reader into the process of making music is truly spine-tingling.	2003-06-08

Richard Mayhew, a young Scot recently moved to London, was only doing what he thought was right when he picked up literally off the street, bruised and bloody and frightened, and took her home. But his good deed gets him sucked down into London Below, which is not a nice place. That's where people live who have fallen through the cracks of society, and some of them have been down there for centuries, moving through the sewers, living in abandoned Underground stations, doing business at the Floating Market, and generally being invisible to London Above. The girl, whose name is Door, is an Opener, like all her family -- but all of them, except Door, were killed by Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, as viciously evil a pair as you'll ever find Above or Below. Door is looking for an explanation, and maybe vengenance, with the assistance of Hunter, her bodyguard, and the thoroughly dodgy Marquis de Carabas, and with Richard (who finds he also has ceased to exist in the upper world) tagging along simply because he has no choice. Gaiman is a master of odd and very original characters and slightly off-center dialogue, and his prose is a delight to read.	2003-06-01

The volumes in Betterway's &quot;Genealogist's Guide&quot; series have been genrally excellent in leading researchers through the special problems, situations, and resources connected with non-Anglo-European-male ancestors. Anyone, even an otherwise experienced family historian, who has attempted to develop a black lineage more than three or four generations back in the United States knows the historical and social problems involved often are considerable - but they aren't insurmountable, as the authors show. Smith, a Houston librarian with legal training, learned early of the reluctance of his elderly relatives to discuss the &quot;slave days&quot; and of the tendency of black genealogists to end their quest with the 1870 census. He begins with the basics, the stuff we all learned (or should have) in the first year of research, but slants it toward the necessities of African-American history, including the need to deal with frequent name-changes, &quot;consulting the elders,&quot; and evaluating family stories (both of which are especially important here). Likewise, in reading the federal census schedules, one must understand what was meant, both officially and locally, by &quot;colored&quot; and &quot;mulatto,&quot; the definitions of which changed over time. Military service records, an important resource in most white pedigrees, are more problematic for black lineages before World War II. Church records are proportionately more important. Smith gives considerable space to the use of white (i.e., slaveholding) family records in tracing black families, and to the proper use of the federal census slave schedules -- subjects few of us have much experience with. Finally, he relates all this through three extended cases drawn from his own family research which exemplify the techniques and adjusted mind-sets he explained earlier. They're well written, carefully worked out, and inspirational as well as informative, and are worth the price of admission by themselves.	2003-05-28

I have to be suspicious of a book subtitled \\"Everything You Need to Know to Trace Your Genealogy Across North America,\\" because that's patently untrue. The Introduction by Emily Anne Croom, \\"Getting Started Tracing Your Ancestors,\\" is well-written and touches all the methodological bases - documenting your sources, \\"clustering,\\" continuing education, etc. - but it's simply not possible to compress a useful discussion of genealogical techniques into seven pages. David A. Fryxell (with whom I'm not familiar) contributes another brief chapter on \\"Finding Your Family Tree Across the U.S. and Canada,\\" which covers much of the same material and adds advice on planning a research trip, whether to a rural courthouse or to Salt Lake City. The great bulk of this volume, though, is a state-by-state outline of where to find the public and academic libraries, state archives, state and local societies, Family History Centers, and other information sources, with a more detailed discussion of resources in selected major cities in each state. Major genealogical periodicals and web sites for each state are included, as are a detailed list of available federal censuses (state censuses, important for filling in the gaps, when they exist, are only summarized, as \\"1846 to 1925\\" Iowa), a list of city directories available at the Family History Library in Salt Lake (though most local libraries have these, too), and other assorted information. The too-brief city chapters are more like \\"civilian\\" travel guides, highlighting sightseeing attractions, downtown hotels and ethnic restaurants. (Do vacationing genealogists hot on the trail of a missing probate file actually stay at the Adolphus in Dallas and eat at Commander's Palace in New Orleans?) Each regional section opens with a rather superficial history essay which suffers from lumping too many states within each region. Comments on the historical roots of \\"the South\\" mean quite different things in Delaware and Texas. Like many guides in our field, this one tries to be all things to all genealogists, in a single not-too-expensive volume, but it ends up being inadequate (or merely insufficient) in most areas for most people much of the time. This is especially true with the recent publication of the completely revised and hugely expanded _The Source,_ which generally succeeds in those grand goals. I suggest you buy that (on CD, if you carry a laptop on your research trips) and go to AAA for maps and travel guides.r field, this one tries to be all things to all genealogists, in a single not-too-expensive volume, but it ends up being inadequate (or merely insufficient) in most areas for most people much of the time.

There are fundamental methodological differences in tracing the history of your Pilgrim ancestors, who got off the boat in Massachusetts and never moved away, and your itchy-footed pioneer forebears, who always were on the edge of settlement, forever looking toward the west. (I have a line which, in a single long generation, moved state-by-state from Baltimore in the 1790s to Iowa in the 1830s.) One of the biggest problems is the tendency of early settlers to arrive somewhere ahead of the recordkeeping apparatus - but recording the ownership of land was almost always the first thing put on paper as soon as the government's clerks arrived. These records often are underused, especially in &quot;metes and bounds&quot; states, because ploughing through a three-page description of boundaries can be daunting. Hatcher, a CG and FASG, and a specialist in problem-solving, has an almost inhuman fondness for land records, however, which she largely succeeds in communicating in this book. She leads you carefully through the steps, from locating that first deed (or grant, or confirmation of colonial title), to tracking the later transfers of ownership, to understanding just what it is you're reading, to knowing how to select and record the essentials, to interpreting what it all means. There are plenty of examples and several case studies, plus a detailed bibliography of key maps and gazetteers for each state. She also includes numerous historical sidelights, such as the observation that less than half the federal public lands originally went to individuals. (Think &quot;railroads.&quot;) This is an excellent and highly readable text in an important subject.	2003-05-28

The author is both an experienced editor and past operator for many years of a cooking school -- a good combination for someone wanting to produce cookbooks, and she's done a couple of dozen of them. Four or five have been collections of chicken recipes, all very handsome, and this one is no exception. I admit to a preference for cookbooks that include glossy, high-quality photos of the dishes; it whets your appetite and gives you some idea what the outcome will (or should) be. Almost every one of these 500 recipes includes a photo and many of them had me drooling on the page before I ever got the book home! After a useful introductory section on choosing and cutting up a chicken -- not one of my favorite chores -- she groups the recipes into \\"Soups, Appetizers & Salads,\\" \\"Midweek Dishes\\" (i.e., not too complicated), \\"Roasts, Casseroles & Pies,\\" \\"Hot & Spicy,\\" \\"Low-Fat,\\" and \\"Special Occasion.\\" (Nope -- no chicken desserts.) I eat a lot of chicken, both for health reasons and because I like chicken, and I've already tried several of these. The Teriyaki Chicken Wings, with sherry, was quite good, and the simmered Chicken & Olives was very interesting (my wife is an olive junky). The Chicken Jambalaya wasn't too far from the way we do it here in south Louisiana, but pretty good on its own account. There's a creamy Sweet-&-Sour Chicken that was unusual (to me) and very good. There also are quite a few Middle Eastern dishes, not usually a cuisine I care for, but some of these look pretty good. I'm definitely getting my money's worth out of this book.	2003-05-28

I first got interested in the Lafitte brothers when I was based in Dallas and learned of their activities in Texas for the Spanish government -- and now I live in south Louisiana, their principal stomping grounds. As with all semi-mythical historical figures, there's a lot of fantasy (to put it politely) that has been published about them. Not to mention all the obfuscatory tales Jean spread himself. Documentable evidence is much, much harder to come by. De Grummond concentrates here on the Lafittes' much celebrated role in the defense of New Orleans against the invasion of British General Pakenham, but she provides some very iffy background information as well. Then, unfortunately, she spoils everything by buying into the story, promulgated by one of his supposed sons (living in Alton, Illinois, no less), that &quot;later Jean changed his name to John Lafflin and dropped out of sight,&quot; turning up later in St. Louis, where his brother, Pierre, also was buried in 1844. If she had stuck to the battle itself -- which she describes and documents pretty well -- everything would have been okay. The *Biographical Sketches* by Morazan is a far more useful source, giving details wherever available about the members of the Battalion and including an excellent bibliography. (De Grummond's &quot;Essay on Authorities&quot; is far less useful.)	2003-05-26

The only website design I've done is for two sites of my own (one small-business, one for hobbies and such), plus family-photo-type sites for a couple for family members. (The fact that I learned to do this stuff in late middle age seems to astonish people, especially those much younger than me.) But I'm a heavy web-surfer and I'm always interested in design issues generally. Krug has a knack for pointing out things that seem obvious in retrospect, and the wit to keep your attention even while you're making mental notes. He takes you through the process of figuring out what people want in a website -- and then discovering what they *really* want -- but he doesn't take sides in religious arguments (pull-downs, Flash, top vs. side navigation bars). Rather, he describes to look at the possibilities and discover what works best when. The book itself is also very &quot;usable&quot; -- short enough to read on a plane trip, filled with real world examples, amusingly but helpfully illustrated. And I already have a list of changes I plan to make to my own little covey of websites.	2003-05-26

This isn't a very long novel, only 193 small-sized pages -- but McEwan certainly packs a lot of character into it. Clive Linley is a famous composer who has been commissioned to write Britain's Millennial Symphony. He lives well and secretly considers himself to be probably a genius. Vernon Halliday is editor-in-chief of a newspaper whose readership is declining and who is noted among his colleagues for not filling up much space in his environment. Both men are past lovers of the marvelous Molly Lane, recently deceased, and probably would never have become such friends were it not for her. Now George, the late Molly's quietly jealous husband, has found in her effects a set of cross-dressing photos of the ambitious, right-wing Foreign Minister whom both Clive and Vernon abhor, and which they all expect will be the political end of him. Vernon wants to publish them, which will also boost his paper's (and his own) fortunes; Clive regards that as a betrayal of Molly's memory. But Clive has his own moral dilemma: While hiking in the Lake District to try to get his creative juices flowing again, he happens upon what he later learns is an impending rape -- but he dreads the interruption of his composing fit and leaves the scene unnoticed. And Vernon (to whom Clive has confided his experience) threatens to tell the police himself. What happens afterward, what results from the two men's outrage and personal disasters, draws the reader attentively along until the final ironic, frightening events in Amsterdam. McEwan's dryly witty style and his ear for nuanced dialogue is, as always, marvelous, and the book deserves its Booker Prize.	2003-05-25

I only discovered this marvelous fantasy series recently, on hearing an interview with the author on NPR, and went straight to the library in search of a copy of this first volume. Artemis Fowl is the twelve-year-old scion of a centuries-old -- and very successful -- Irish family of criminal masterminds. He's a genius and he's dangerous, though there are still touches of the adolescent about him. His bodyguard-butler, a huge but sensitive character named Butler (and the only human ever to have taken on a full-grown bull troll and lived), descends from another family whose members have been in service to the Fowls for so long, they gave their surname to the profession. Artemis is determined to restore the family's sagging financial status by acquiring a very large amount of gold. And where better to obtain gold than from the Little Folk? Enter Holly Short, a fairy, and more specifically, an elf. Also a leprechaun, but that's just her job description: Captain in the Recon section of the Lower Elements Police. The Little People now live far under the Earth, having lost control of the surface long ago to the Mud People (that's us), but have compensated with technological developments far in advance of our own. How Holly becomes the main element in Artemis's kidnapping and extortion plot, . . . ah, that would be telling. But it's a huge amount of fun and the film will be out before long -- and adolescent boys are going to love Mulch the mining dwarf.	2003-05-18

When I first read this fat, extraordinary novel a decade ago, I concluded it was one of the best science fiction novels produced in (at least) the past half-century, and, having now re-read it, I still believe that. It's set in Cherryh's Merchanter universe (a couple of generations after the concluding war, the story of which she told in Downbelow Station), but that's really only the distant backdrop. (You'll also find here the back-story to Forty Thousand in Gehenna.) This is a very detailed, very in-depth, very carefully worked-out, very thought-provoking study of power and the claustrophobic effects of its mis-management, of the relationship of \\"natural born\\" psychology to manufactured and tailored minds, of the effects on a society of an artificial underclass (the \\"azi\\") that is both more and less than chattel slavery, . . . and along with all that, a satisfying and very affecting story of a cold, slightly inhuman genius and the mystery of her death (which was possibly a murder), and the replicate who is intended to replace her -- and who succeeds more completely, perhaps, than her creators ever anticipated. At 680 pages, there are, of course, several other plots moving full-tilt, also filled with detail and nuance, but they all interrelate nearly seamlessly. Her ability to play off one character's collection of concerns against another's is amazing, and she shows a considerable (and very speculative) understanding of the depths of psychological intervention. She's also a master of precise prose . . . when she wants to be. I have never doubted that this book did indeed deserve the Hugo it was awarded. And now I shall put it back on its shelf for another decade.	2003-05-09

All writers of trilogies are aware of the prevalence of \\"middle volume\\" syndrome, but Sawyer seems mostly to have escaped its effects. Ponter Boddit, Neanderthal physicist in a world parallel to our own, returns to the world ruled by Homo sapiens in this sequel to Hominids, this time in a more organized manner and as one of his culture's envoys. He re-establishes his tentative relationship with psychologically damaged geneticist Mary Vaughan and Sawyer explores all the possibilities of interspecies romance -- though Mary often comes off as surprisingly naive for so well-educated a person. The Neanderthals generally turn out to have made better choices than we did (Sawyer's opinions are undoubtedly much of the reason he wrote the story in the first place), though their reproductive pattern lacks some of our own high points. The one comparison that irritates me, actually, is that Canada generally is shown to be culturally and socially superior to the U.S., . . . though I admit isn't a difficult argument to make. And I think Sawyer may be a bit naive himself in expecting the two national governments in North America to allow visiting Neanderthals so much liberty of movement -- especially given our present Administration. However, that's his style in most of his novels. It's a good, highly readable yarn, though, with a nice bit of poetic irony at the end, and I look forward to the conclusion.	2003-04-22

In my opinion, Bill Gibson has never written a bad book -- but even so, this is his best work in a long time. He sets his story in the present this time instead of the near future, but the feel of it is much the same. Which, I suppose is part of the point he wants to make; the future is now. Cayce Pollard is a thirty-something freelance marketing consultant with an unusual specialty: By applying her &quot;allergy&quot; to trademarks, she can predict very accurately whether corporate logos and branding will be successful in the marketplace. (Tommy Hilfiger and the Michelin Man are especially toxic.) She's also a &quot;footagehead,&quot; one of an international group of avid afficionados who study and endlessly analyze a series of short and highly affecting video clips discovered on the Internet. The two come together when the head of an important London ad agency (with his own agenda, naturally) hires her to uncover the creators of the footage. The third major thread in her life is contemplating the disappearance of her father, a retired CIA-connected security specialist in New York on the morning of September 11th. All these themes and plots weave themselves together in intriguing ways, and in Gibson's classic narrative style. But, aside from the story itself, much of the enjoyment one gets from Gibson's books is a result of his skill at description and simile, all of it highly quotable.	2003-04-18

This is the fourth novel in the Charlotte and Inspector Thomas Pitt series of high Victorian mysteries, though I've read several others out of order. All of them seem to be a mix of police procedural and social commentary, in which Pitt has to delve into the depths of London's underclass while Charlotte wades through the unpleasantnesses of Society's drawing rooms. Sometimes the latter is better written and more interesting than the former, but in this case the mystery is interesting and also funny in an oddball way. The recently buried keep turning up out of their coffins -- sitting in hansom cabs, or in church pews, or leaning against their own tombstones. All were apparently natural deaths, so Thomas isn't even quite sure for much of the book whether any serious crime actually has been committed. Meanwhile, Mr. Carlisle, an avid and politically astute social reformer, is making converts to his cause of reforming the workhouses by dragooning his social acquaintances into visiting the slums and rookeries. Charlotte (who married down) is a likeable enough character, and her sister, Lady Ashworth (who married up), is well done, but Thomas himself seems to emote too much. Aunt Vespasia, on the other hand, is a marvelous depiction of a grand and starchy old lady who's smarter and more socially aware than most of her contemporaries. Although Perry repeats her bad habit of nearly blowing off the solution to the mystery in favor of sociological commentary, this is a pretty good read.	2003-04-10

With Charlotte's help in the drawing rooms, Pitt must try to sort out who did what to whom and then overcome the protectiveness of the families involved in order to prove it.

But Pitt must try to discover what happened to the two infants whose bodies have been dug up in the gardens in the center of fashionable Callander Square, and the two sisters resolve to assist him in rather ingenious ways. In a way, this second book in the series is a superior sort of soap opera, investigating the relationships within the families who live on the Square, uncovering their numerous scandals, and making it clear that wealth and privilege are no guarantee of personal quality. Some of the families are divided or devasted by Pitt's investigations, and by the additonal murders that take place, while others are reunited and perhaps improved. And the plot is again well laid and logically developed.	2003-03-19

It survived in its male line until the death at a young age of the 11th Earl of Northumberland in 1670, leaving only a daughter. Elizabeth Percy's third husband was a Seymour and the duke of Somerset and her granddaughter, another Elizabeth, married Sir Hugh Smithson, who adopted the name of Percy and became 1st Duke of Northumberland. It is through this line that the family still survives. Lomas's goal is not to supersede but to update and reinterpret the work of Edward Barrington de Fonblanque (ANNALS OF THE HOUSE OF PERCY, 1887) in light of new data and perceptions. The family's progress in national life was far from smooth and even, being visited at intervals with political disaster, economic near-ruin, and plain bad luck. His approach is one of scholarly detail but his style is quite readable, making this an entirely accessible case study accompanied by a lengthy bibliography.	2003-03-13

As Townsend points out, it's not just a long and illustrious genealogy that determines which families will be most influential, but established influence combined with wealth in the form of land. And all this happens with the consent of the governed, for &quot;England is governed in times of excitement by its people; in quiet times by its property.&quot; Things have changed somewhat in the intervening 138 years -- but not much, not really. In any case, the thirty-one families treated here are those most likely to be of interest to the student of English peerage genealogy, from the truly ancient Percies, Talbots, and Greys to the relatively more recent Barings, Somersets, and Seymours. Sanford takes pains to question family traditions and his no-nonsense style is occasionally acerbic and sardonic. (I suspect he was not himself a Tory.) Details of family goings-on are plentiful, as are the names of those, high and low, with whom the powerful interacted. And while there are no source notes, of course, the author refers often to other authors. This work, available in a reprint edition, is an excellent source of much information in a small space.	2003-03-13

But the family nearly became extinct in the male line until Emperor Charles VI promulgated the Pragmatic Sanction, enabling his daughter, Maria Theresia, to succeed him in all his estates and titles. Bavaria contested this maneuver but lost the War of the Austrian Succession, and Maria Theresia's demonstrated abilities in diplomatic and military affairs -- and the election of her husband, Franz I, to be Holy Roman Emperor -- cemented her position. Moreover, she produced sixteen children, most of whom married well and three of whom have descendants. This volume is a straightforward outline of those descents, one major line per chapter, with no narrative text at all. The compiler cites fewer than twenty secondary sources, so there's no original research here, either (and there are no specific footnotes). It's primary use, therefore, is as a ready reference source for the families covered, but even that utility is somewhat limited by the lack of an index.	2003-03-13

My wife is a great fan of the Charlotte Pitt / Inspector Thomas Pitt mystery series. She often asks for clarifying information about the details of Victorian society, and retails bits of business and dialogue from the stories, and she finally got me interested, too. And I have to say, this first one, which introduces all the principal characters, is quite good. Charlotte's two sisters, Sarah and Emily, her parents, Edward and Caroline, her brother-in-law, Dominic, and Emily's intended, Sir George Ashworth -- all are drawn in fine, fully rounded narrative and descriptive lines. And Charlotte herself, of course, is a fascinating person, as is Thomas Pitt, with whom she becomes acquainted during the search for a serial killer apparently living in their own neighborhood. Perry does an excellent job delineating the caste system of late 19th century London society, with women living almost in purdah and under a rigid double moral standard. Not to forget the mystery plot, either, which is well thought out and developed.	2003-03-13

Since he spent much of his time at the English court, he conveniently anglicized his name as &quot;Owen Tudor&quot; (being prouder, apparently, of his grandfather than his father). The earlier Tudor (who died in 1367) was a man of considerable estates and power in the island of Anglesey, an area the conquering English monarchs kept in their own hands rather than relinquishing it to the tender mercies of the marcher lords. This was the origin of the dynasty that replaced the direct Plantagenet descent from William I but which produced only five monarchs in a little over a century. Turton goes into considerable detail regarding the careers of the earlier Tudors, which is quite useful, but he also goes far afield in detailing the general international affairs of England, Wales, and France, as well as the personal lives of a number of non-Tudors, some of them quite minor historical figures. While the book is enjoyable and well written, none of this extraneous material is new or original with him. One suspects it was added to fill out what otherwise would have been a rather thin volume in a too-restricted market.	2003-03-13

I first met Carolyn Cherry(h) at AggieCon in the late '70s, when she was still teaching school in Oklahoma and had just completed her first novel, _Brothers of Earth_. She had written that book in a sort of social vacuum, with no notion of the existence of the fannish world and was amazed at the warm reception she received from a bunch of enthusiastic strangers. That book and its sequels, plus the \\"Morgaine\\" trilogy, made me a fan and I enjoyed her work for years, including this first installment in the \\"Merchanter\\" series when it first appeared. Unfortunately, success seems to have made her lazy in recent years and she has recently been churning out interminable formulaic series, often sharing the credit with younger writers, and I find most of those efforts to be unreadable. Anyway. Downbelow Station showcases Cherry's inarguable talent for complex but understandable geopolitical plots, many-layered characterization, and truly alien cultures that humans are never really going to fully understand. There are several sides to the conflict here: The Company, now in charge of an isolationist Earth; the Fleet, once the enforcement arm of the Company but now pretty much independent; Union, formed out of the farther worlds of the Beyond and possessed of a new psychological style completely foreign to Earth; Pell, a station circling a planet which circles Tau Ceti, and which only wants to left alone; and the free Merchanters, making a living hauling goods between the worlds and the stations. Pell is a civilized republic in the best tradition, but they're about to lose all that. Mazian's Fleet has been on its own devices for far too long to have a regard for any other culture and is quite willing to destroy a station and all its thousands of inhabitants in order to keep it out of Union's hands. And Union is a chilling example of nascent fascism based on state-controlled cloning. The Merchanters, who are the focus of most of the later books in this universe, must find a way to work together if they are to survive at all. Peopling this tumultuous plot are the Konstantin family, the sort-of Medicis of Pell, willing to believe the best of others and appalled at what power-seekers are doing to their station, especially the Lukas family. And there's Capt. Mallory of Fleet carrier NORWAY, a bloody-minded commander who nevertheless hews to her own kind of morality. And the hisa, the indigines of Downbelow, whose nonviolent assistance to Pell becomes crucial as the story progresses. And Jessad, the Union agent who has his own agenda on Pell. And Josh Talley, ex-Union agent who wants to find a new home there -- or maybe he's not so \\"ex.\\" And there's a large supporting cast, all of them also exceptionally well developed. This is a fat book, more than 500 pages, but it never slows down and you'll never lose interest. Definitely one of Cherryh's best.to work together if they are to survive at all.

I can't recall another trilogy in which I so enjoyed the first two volumes (see my earlier reviews) and was so thoroughly disappointed in the finale. Lyra (now called Silvertongue) and Will Parry are back in Lyra's world this time, gearing up for the final battle between Good and Evil, trying to reach Lord Asriel, who commands the forces of humankind against the malevolence of God. Lyra was kidnapped by her mother at the end of Book 2 and has now been stashed in the Himalayas, and Will has to rescue her. He just happens to meet up with the migrating armored bears, who promise to help. Will's long lost father also has a key role -- there's no such thing as a chance encounter in this universe -- and so is Dr. Mary Malone from our own world. So far, so good. But by the halfway point in the narrative, we're involved with angels who have very human characteristics and whom I found totally unbelievable as what they are supposed to be, and the pace has slowed to a frustrating crawl. Frankly, I couldn't finish the book, which was very upsetting after all the time I invested in the story and the pleasure I drew from it until now.	2003-03-09

McEwan is a master of the strange, odd, and peculiar. Of the eight stories in this collection of his early work, the best are the infamous &quot;Homemade,&quot; which is rather humorous and only partly about incest, and &quot;Last Day of Summer,&quot; which is very well told and displays the author's outstanding ability to develop characters with no wasted effort, and which has a dreadful ending. Not bad, merely dreadful. &quot;Butterflies&quot; is a spooky bit of psychopathology. &quot;Conversations with a Cupboard Man&quot; is another excursion into a warped personality, and you can understand exactly how this poor guy ended up the way he is. The title story, &quot;First Love, Last Rites,&quot; is not the best, being an aimless sort of tale about being young and poor and semi-in-love, with eel-trapping and rat-catching thrown in. &quot;Disguises&quot; was a bit hard to read at first, being written in a sort of stream-of-consciousness style, but it gets better -- much better. McEwan obviously has a thing for aberrant mental and social development. &quot;Solid Geometry&quot; is probably the weakest piece here, a sort-of science fiction story that telegraphs its ending in about the third paragraph. &quot;Cocker at the Theatre,&quot; on the other hand, is a truly hilarious short-short.	2003-03-06

Many trilogies suffer from having a weak middle volume, but that certainly isn't the case here. Where THE GOLDEN COMPASS told the adventures of young Lyra Belacqua, at the beginning of  this volume we meet Will Parry, a boy of our own world with his own quest. The two connect in Ci'gazze, a third world adjoining their own universes, a place haunted by Specters and mobs of vicious children, torn asunder by Lord Asriel's bridge-building. But we also find out what Asriel is really up to: He wants to reopen the war between Mankind and God, to liberate Man from the Authority. And Lyra's nemesis, Mrs. Coulter, is aligned with the Church on the other side. We find out what Dust is in our terms, and why it (and the Specters) are attracted to adults but not to children. And we meet both Dr. Mary Malone, physicist and specialist in \\"dark matter,\\" and John Parry, explorer and shaman in the world of Ci'gazze. The strong characterization and narrative vigor of the story are remarkable and you'd better have Volume Three ready to hand when you finish this one.	2003-02-23

The territory was divided into ten districts and the methods followed in the enumeration were the same as for the census at large, with 105 columns in six schedules. This transcription appears to include only the first two schedules: Native Cherokees, Shawnees, and Delawares, and adopted whites; and orphans under the age of sixteen. Information transcribed includes only page and line number, name, race, sex, age, marital status, occupation, and remarks (and there seem to be many more remarks by census-takers than one would expect in a state enumeration). Since Native American documentary resources are so slim, the researcher will want to pursue the more specialized schedules. It should be noted that most of the names as recorded don't sound \\"Indian.\\" Edward Goodman is listed as a \\"Native Cherokee,\\" and so is George Wilkerson, though you will also find listings for Sa-gi-ya Bearpaw and Seali Going Snake. As with any census, spelling of surnames varies considerably and Benge has made an effort to consolidate variant spellings in the index (though the researcher, of course, should not assume that two similar names actually are cognates). Happily, data is not alphabetized but is presented in the original recorded order. While I cannot judge the accuracy of Benge's transcription, I saw very few blanks or question marks, which may be either an indication of skilled reading or of exceptionally clear penmanship. While this is a very useful resource for the genealogist who has just uncovered Native American ancestry, I wish the compiler had included a much lengthier introduction and perhaps a few maps of the districts.	2003-02-23

For, unless one descends from a famous family, such images are likely to be distressingly anonymous. As with any type of historical research, searching out the context can greatly increase one's chances -- and in a photo, while the countryside and the buildings may not change, the clothing of the subjects almost certainly will. Even those expert in other areas of historical knowledge often make mistakes in interpreting the depicted garments of ordinary people. Or not so ordinary: The author describes several misinterpretations even of Paul Revere's clothing in the famous John Singleton Copley portrait. And Severa, as probably the leading historian of American costume, is certainly the best possible author for a massive study like this. Each chapter covers one decade of the 19th century since the practical introduction of photography, including first a discussion of general trends and the effects of manufacturing innovations and social influences, and then examining and discussing a large number of specific individual and group portraits of farmers, families, children, shop girls, and soldiers in considerable detail. This isn't &quot;just&quot; a reference guide, though, but a fully realized history and the reader not only will learn about the details of American dress but also will acquire a number of new insights in historical method.	2003-02-23

His academic and scholarly accomplishments and recognitions over the past half-century are many and deserved, and his list of publishing credits is lengthy. This volume follows logically from his TEXAS AND TEXANS IN THE CIVIL WAR (1995) and LONE STAR GENERALS IN GRAY (2000), helping to complete his portrait of Texas forces in the War between the States. Texas contributed seventy-eight infantry and cavalry regiments and thirty-five artillery batteries which saw service from the Virginia Tidewater to the California border (not even counting the fourteen regiments and independent battalions raised for state service, and which are not considered here). Many Texan soldiers served in the same unit throughout the War. Since the regiment, the basic military building block, was usually recruited in a single region of the state and was commanded by a local (elected) individual, the genealogical value of understanding the system is obvious. Nor is this simply a handbook setting out the key details of each unit (though those are included), but a narrative history and explanation of the Texas military establishment, the broad campaigns and specific battles in which its units fought, and the successes and failures of the men who commanded it. There also are nearly nine hundred footnotes (many of them considerably more than source citations) and a lengthy bibliographical essay, making this almost required reading for any student of the Civil War and any family researcher with mid-19th century Texas ancestry.	2003-02-23

Partly because I'm a librarian, I've been reading children's literature and young adult books all my life, and the mark of a successful YA story is that it's just as enjoyable and satisfying for an adult as for a kid. In this first volume of a trilogy, Pullman definitely meets that standard. It's described as a \\"fantasy,\\" but it's actually an alternate universe tale, and that becomes explicit late in the book. Lyra Belacqua is an eleven-year-old terror living in Jordan College in her world's version of Oxford University, lording it over the servant-class kids, staging mud battles with the \\"gyptian\\" kids who work the narrowboats on the river, and generally having a good old time. Then (by being where she shouldn't be) she overhears her uncle, Lord Asriel, an extremely dominating character, tell the Jordan Scholars about the Aurora in the far north, and the origin of Dust, and the possibility of building a bridge to the other world that's visible through the Aurora. And Lyra's life suddenly becomes much more interesting and dangerous (and cold). She's marked out by her special abilities with the alethiometer, which always tells the truth, and by her ability to get around anyone. Pullman has created some terrific characters here, especially Iorek Byrnison, the king of the armored bears, and the viciously evil Mrs. Coulter, and Serafina Pekkala, the witch queen. The evil forces in this book come from the Church, which I don't find at all difficult to accept. (Pullman has been condemned by numerous established religious groups for his opinions and viewpoints.) Most fascinating of all, though, is the concept of the daemon, a sort of human soul outside the person, which takes the shape of an animal and which is intimately connected with its human in a way that's difficult for the daemon-less to fully understand. But having a daemon is what defines a human being and it's the most fundamental difference between Lyra's world and ours.	2003-02-21

Graphic novels are difficult to review (for me), since one has to consider both the art and the story. In this case, the nicely restrained and carefully shaded black-and-white line drawings ensure that Collins's storytelling gets center-stage. The plot is straightforward: Michael O'Sullivan is a hit man for the Looney mob in Rock Island, Illinois, in 1930, with close ties to Capone in Chicago. Purely from ignorant curiosity, Michael Jr. sneaks along on one of his dad's \\"missions\\" and sees things he ought not to have seen. Which leads to the death of his mother and brother at the hands of Looney's psychopathic son. Which means bloody vengeance by Michael Sr. It all rolls along with the inevitability of Greek tragedy. No super-heros, no heroics of any kind -- just cold revenge. This is one of the best graphic novels I've seen yet, in all its aspects.	2003-02-17

This is the sequel to _The Archer's Tale,_ the second novel of the adventures of Thomas of Hookton, English archer in the wars with France during the 1340s, and of his involvement in a quest for the Grail. The author is masterful in his descriptions of medieval warfare, and also in his delineations of character, whether of Thomas and his friend, Robbie Douglas, or of their implacably vicious enemy, Father Bernard Taillebourg, or of minor figures like the deeply wounded Will Skeat and the impressively ambitious Cardinal Bessieres. The story begins with the Battle of Neville's Cross, just outside Durham, and ends with the startling defeat of Charles, Duke of Blois. Startling, because Charles was intelligent and did everything right, and ought to have won -- but no battle plan, as they say, ever survives contact with the enemy. Perhaps what I like best about this series is that Cornwell gives as much attention to the minutiae of everyday existence in the 14th century as to the great battles, and that even with the Grail figuring importantly in the plot, there's no hint of mysticism or the supernatural on the part of the omniscient narrator.

As a relatively novice photographer (haven't owned one since my old Brownie Hawkeye) with some knowledge of computers and a new digital camera, I've been working my way through as many books on digicams and image-editing software as I can find. Some are pretty general, some are more specialized, but most seem to repeat the same mostly superficial information and advice on both photography and digital editing. This book is the great exception! Ang is a very talented photographer and this lushly printed... volume is crammed with his work, but he's also a very good teacher. The first part of the book, under the heading of \\"Total Photography,\\" is a mini-course in types of cameras and lenses, lighting, optical physics, and the essential practical differences in using film-based and digital cameras. (There's also a survey of information on specific models of cameras, printers, and scanners, which will soon be outdated and which might have been omitted.) The second section, \\"Photography for the Digital Age,\\" leads you through such topics as composition, zoom, optical distortion, color balance, and how to avoid or at least fix the most common mistakes; I learned a great deal from his clear explanations and visual examples. \\"A Compendium of Ideas\\" is almost a separate book, being an excursion through all the major categories of subjects that interest people with cameras, from buildings and travel to microphotography and high-speed sports; you'll want to return to this section now and then for leisurely browsing. \\"Radical Conversions\\" and \\"All about Image Manipulation\\" are worth the price of the book all by themselves, with very clear and often very detailed discussions of issues which I'm sure are old hat to experienced shutterbugs but which are new and often perplexing to me, including proper cropping, burning-in and dodging, sharpening, blurring, cross-processing, color vs. black-and-white, and lots of others. Ang is quite good at balancing received photographic wisdom with new digital ideas. He also gets deeply into such computer-specific subjects as levels, cloning, and the differences and similarities between channels, layers, and masks. (He seems not to have much use for such glitzy effects-filter tricks as stained glass and embossing filters, with which I have to agree.) \\"The Output Adventure\\" is very good on getting the color on your monitor to agree with the color your printer produces, and there's a final section on portfolios, copyrights, and the business of photography.

This seventeenth installment in the Kinsey Milhone series is something of a departure both for Kinsey and for the author. The detective, while loyal to her few close friends, is essentially a loner, especially when she's working, but this time she's linked up with two retired cops in attempting to solve an eighteen-year-old murder. And Grafton has based her story on the true unsolved murder in 1969 of a teenage girl whose body turned up in a quarry near Lompoc, California. In fact, a picture of the victim's reconstructed face is included in hopes a reader will have information. The plot is well constructed, as usual in Grafton's work, with the story's progression revolving around the routine investigations that make up most real detective work. Kinsey seldom gets involved in a shoot-out. And right down to the last few pages, there are still several strong possibilities for the killer, so even if you think you know whodunnit, you won't be sure. Grafton is also very good at delineating the details of character development. But not everything in this book is perfect and, in fact, the author seems to be getting a bit sloppy as the series ages. As I have complained in my reviews of her previous books, Grafton habitually over-describes. Kinsey doesn't just make coffee, she takes the lid off the can, gets the measuring spoon out of the drawer, measures out the coffee, puts the lid back on, turns on the tap, fills a glass with water, pours the water into the resevoir of the coffee-maker, turns it on, . .  etc. This book could have been 25% shorter -- and better -- without losing anything important if Grafton had a copyeditor willing to argue with a millionaire bestselling author.	2003-02-04
1247167:US	53072811	R39RUDDP6FZK2U	076530418X	599134250	Stories of Your Life and Others	Books	5	75	87	N	N	One of the best recent collections I've read . . .	I gave up a decade ago on trying to keep up with the science fiction magazines, so I only recently became aware of Ted Chiang's wide range of ideas and considerable proficiency at communicating them. There are eight stories in this anthology; all of them are at least good and several are excellent. Perhaps the best is the title piece, \\"Story of Your Life,\\" which is also the only one I had previously read. It's about simultaneity vs. sequentiality and free will vs. predestination, with a strong taste of the sort of notions regarding time that Vonnegut originally made use of in _Slaughterhouse Five_. \\"Tower of Babylon\\" is sort of Babylonian science fiction, about the building of a mud-brick tower that takes four months to ascend and which reaches all the way to the vaults of heaven. An intriguing yarn, though the ending is a little weak. \\"Understand\\" is an interesting kind of riff on \\"Flowers for Algernon,\\" but with the implications very much updated. \\"Division by Zero\\" is about the effect on a woman mathematician who discovers (and proves) that the basic principals of math are quite arbitrary and inconsistent. While it's a good psychological portrait, and also vividly presents some (to me) novel ideas, the math and the character development really have nothing to do with each other. \\"Seventy-Two Letters\\" is set in an alternate Victorian London in which nomenclature, the act of bestowing names on things, has become an experimental science. There's a certain Bruce Sterling flavor here, but it's really not at all derivative. \\"The Evolution of Human Science\\" is a short-short that originally appeared in NATURE. I'm not sure I got the point of it, frankly, though it has a rather neat twisty ending. \\"Hell Is the Absence of God\\" is another terrific tale of an alternate world in which the souls of the deceased can be seen ascending or descending, Hell is often visible just below street level, and miracles are a regular news item. But a visitation by an angel (tracked by CB) is just as likely to kill an innocent bystander with an exploding window as to restore sight to the blind. Moreover, the whole God and salvation thing is entirely happenstantial, arbitrary, and without justice of any kind; a convicted child-killer who sees the Light goes to Heaven after his execution, while the victim of two previous miracles -- the first crippling, the second restorative -- receives a wasted third miracle she doesn't want or need. This is a quietly angry story and, as a thoroughgoing secularist who is frequently put off by smug santimony, I really enjoyed it. \\"Liking  What You See: A Documentary\\" is a very thoughtful and insightful examination of the misuse of beauty, of the effects of \\"lookism,\\" and of the ruthlessness of media advertising. Very nicely done. In all, I have to say that while Chiang doesn't always get it quite right, he's certainly well above the average. I'm definitely going to have to keep up with his future work.s just as likely to kill an innocent bystander with an exploding window as to restore sight to the blind.

Any aristocracy wants to extend its influence socially and geographically, and its first task in that pursuit is to be noticed, especially by means of very conspicuous consumption. In Europe between the Renaissance and the French Revolution, this meant the development of the court as probably the most important influence in a nation's political and cultural life. This lush volume surveys twelve of the great courts, from England, France, Russia, and Spain, to the princely establishments of Florence, Savoy, and Bavaria, as well as the singular oddity of the papal court in Rome. In addition to the pretty pictures -- which are very numerous -- the specialist authorities who wrote the chapters have investigated and largely reinterpreted the fuction of the European court. Whom, exactly, were they designed to impress? Were they really instruments of absolutism? How did they function, day to day? The picture that results is much more subtle than one might suppose, especially in the subject of power and patronage.	2003-01-24

The conquest of Ireland was followed by the Flight of the Wild Geese, in which much of the Irish aristocracy fled to other Catholic countries (notably France and Spain) and was largely forgotten at home. The government of today's Ireland, however, has been granting courtesy titles to claimants who can prove their descents. Ellis is a noted scholar and popular writer in the area of Celtic studies and history and this enabled him to be \\"invited in\\" by the heads of the families to examine their claims. Each of these is \\"the chief of the name\\" -- though some also hold other Gaelic titles, such as Conor O'Brien, \\"The O'Brien,\\" who also is hereditary Prince of Thomond (as well as being a baronet and Baron Inchiquin in the Peerage of Ireland under the UK). They generally have more money (based on land ownership) and education than average, and their influence in Irish culture can be considerable. The author does a very creditable job of outlining the lineage and political history of each of these families, each in its own chapter, as well as the modern-day activities of the chiefs in regaining their social positions. Following the publication of the first edition, a scandal erupted around Terence McCarthy, recognized as The McCarthy Mor, who turned out to be a complete fraud, and that episode, which badly damaged the credibility of the chiefs of Ireland, is also recounted in detail in this edition. An articulate, informative, and very well written book.	2003-01-24

Until the very last couple of pages in this twentieth and last volume of the Aubrey-Maturin saga, I was unsure of the implications of the book's title. But I was pleased to find that Jack's &quot;flag-sickness&quot; has been appeased. With the Napoleonic wars ended, the captain of the SURPRISE has had to go to revolutionary Chile to find ways of continuing to build his reputation, this time in the development of the infant republic's navy. There is a fine ship-to-ship action against a much larger Spanish vessel, and all the usual trials and tribulations of beating around the Horn. Moreover, the recently widowed Dr. Maturin has a much larger part this time even than usual, in his slightly odd pursuit of Christine Wood, widow of the governor of Sierra Leone and a noted naturalist in her own right. A mid-life crisis? We don't know how all that will turn out, unfortunately.  It's sad that there will be no more installments to the story, but this is a reasonably satisfying conclusion.	2003-01-21

This nineteenth installment in the series is something of a return to the blood-and-thunder days of the earlier volumes, as Jack Aubrey, pausing at Madeira with his family before setting off on a putative hydrographic expedition to Chile (as always when Dr. Maturin is involved, there's a good deal more here than meets the eye), is told of Bonaparte's escape from Elba -- and is ordered to hoist his commodore's pennant once more, to take command of all the available ships in the area, and to repair at once to Gibralter to seal up the Med and protect Allied shipping. Then he's off to the Adriatic to disable the French ship-building activities in the region and to cut off the shipment of an astonishing amount of gold from North Africa to the Balkan Moslems to encourage them to intercede on the Emperor's behalf against the Russians and Austrians. Okay, there's a lot of politics here -- but it's a side of the last days of the Napoleonic Empire most of us know little if anything about, and there's plenty of skullduggery on Stephen Maturin's part as well as naval action against an Algerine galley. And not to forget the Adventure of the Unicorn's Horn and the Hand of Glory, which is one of the falling-down funniest episodes O'Brian has ever produced. On the other hand, there are two quite shocking deaths, too, one early in the book and one late, . . . but that, as they say, is life. An excellent entry in the saga.	2003-01-20

This eighteenth volume in the Aubrey-Mathurin saga is relatively action-less. For once, Jack has been assigned to routine post-captain's duty in the Brest blockade squadron, sailing back and forth for weeks on end. I don't believe the great guns are ever once fired in anger in this book. But, however (as they say), there's a lot here for the faithful reader of the series -- mostly domestic, with Jack being caught in an old adultery, as he says, \\"without a leg to stand on,\\" but getting back with Sophie eventually. It's 1814, and with peace about to break out, Jack is very worried about his lack of a professional future, wholly expecting to be \\"yellowed\\" -- being made admiral in time but given no command -- having unfortunately crossed his admiral, whose nephew wants to enclose the common on Jack's manor. (Think agribusiness and economies of scale vs. the family farm). Perhaps he can increase his professional stock by hiring out to develop a new navy for revolutionary Chile. . . . Stephen spends a good deal of time ashore in France tending to intelligence matters, but we get no details. ...	2003-01-15

He’s been enjoying the time at home in Smallbridge with his wife and son, but he’s also getting restless. Then the First Lord comes to his rescue by sending him off to deal with the mutinous crew of a brig in the harbor of Le Havre, the result of a tyrannical and viciously cruel commanding officer. Hornblower, of course, finds a way not only to disarm the mutiny but to capture several French ships in the process. And then, being Hornblower, and Napoleon being on the retreat, he manages to land a couple hundred marines from the Channel Fleet and finds himself appointed Military Governor of Le Havre. Barbara joins him there and when the Emperor abdicates to Elba, she goes off to Vienna to play hostess for her brother, the Duke of Wellington (and that’s the last we see of her for the remainder of the story).<br /><br />Hornblower goes back to Smallbridge for a short while but then returns to pay a visit to his old friends, the Comte de Gracay and his widowed daughter-in-law, Marie, who featured in the first-written trilogy in the series, _Captain Horatio Hornblower_. Hornblower loves his wife, but he also still holds a passion for Marie. Of course, Napoleon refuses to stay abdicated and the Hundred Days finds all them trying to carry out a guerrilla campaign in the Upper Loire Valley with only a handful of royalists, but it’s a major struggle.<br /><br />In terms of quality, this episode in the series falls right in the middle. It’s rather episodic in structure, the result of having first been serialized in a magazine, and there’s rather less naval action than usual, Hornblower being tuck on land for much of the book. Still, it’s a good read -- and you definitely don’t want to start here in the series but the emotional back-story will be essential in keeping up with things.	2003-01-10

This volume offers more than two hundred of the best from the past seventy-five years -- though, presumably because of changes in tastes, most actually date from the 1970s and later. Along with a large number of excellent recipes, many of them enticingly photographed, there are fascinating bits of culinary trivia: the circumstances behind the introduction of sangria, zucchini, and Belgian waffles to the U.S., the ups and downs of coffee-drinking, the invention of instant biscuit mix, the fudge brownie, and white chocolate, and many other subjects of interest. As always with the magazine, the recipes are clear and easily reproducible.	2003-01-10

Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, having sailed off on a combination privateering and intelligence mission in the SURPRISE back in the twelfth novel in the saga, finally are nearly home again -- and this is installment number sixteen! It's hard to believe, too, that after so many volumes, with at least one circumnavigation and any number of roundings of Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope, we find Britain still embroiled in what we in the States refer to as the War of 1812. And what a journey this book narrates, from the witnessing of a new volcanic island and capture of a most irregular privateer in the mid-Pacific, to anxious flight through the Andes by mule and llama, to yet another encounter with ice-islands in the south Atlantic. Although the plotting seems thin at times and lacking in useful details, the narration is as adroit as ever, especially in the author's patented style of understatement. Not his best work by far, but very much worth reading.	2003-01-08

I loved THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, not only for the story itself but for the way Peter Jackson brought it into being as faithfully as possible to the book, within the bounds of cinematic necessity. This meant a great deal in the way of SFX that would not have been possible even a very few years ago. The second disk of the DVD set handles that subject very nicely, but there's also the more traditional part of behind-the-scenes, which is the design, costuming, prop-making, and makeup art of the picture. This volume is a very nice collection of drawings, matte paintings, models, and other art work, from early concepts to final choices. In fact, my only complaint is that it should have been at least three times as long! There will be a second companion volume for THE TWO TOWERS, and I shall buy that one, too.	2003-01-06

This fifteenth novel in the series is not one of the author's better efforts, I'm afraid. The SURPRISE has just left Sidney Cove when a female stowaway is discovered in the cable tier. She turns out to be Clarissa, a transported convict under the protection of Midshipman Oakes (for which almost no explanation is given), to whom she is quickly married. (&quot;Clarissa Oakes,&quot; in fact, was the English title of this volume, and I hve no idea why they changed it.) Most of the remainder of the book is taken up with the ship's progress across the South Seas and, although there is a land battle at the very end (and even that experienced at one remove), the bulk of the story is an exploration of Clarissa's character and how it was formed, as well as the extremely divisive effect of her somewhat warped personality on the ship's officers and company. As usual, O'Brian shows great skill in narrating a plethora of overlapping subplots, both supporting and complementary, most of them depending on the shifting relationships among the inhabitants of a closed universe -- a ship at sea for weeks and months at a time out of sight of land -- and for that reason the book is certainly worth reading. But if you're in search of a more usual naval adventure, this isn't quite it.	2003-01-05

He has a terrific talent for incrementally developing his characters, slowly introducing the reader into their minds and lives, as he demonstrates again with Muriel Wynn, the driven chief deputy prosecuting attorney, and Larry Starczek, a talented homicide detective. The two of them have been having a largely destructive relationship for many years, and while neither of them is really a &quot;bad guy,&quot; they're aren't entirely good guys, either. In other words, they're real people. The same is true of Arthur Raven, the corporate attorney who gets appointed by the federal court to be counsel for Rommy &quot;Squirrel&quot; Gandolph in the last round of appeals on his way to execution. Arthur, who is a bundle of personal problems and contradictions, is nevertheless the closest thing in this story to a wholly innocent person. Then there's Gillian Sullivan, the ex-judge who originally sentenced Gandolph, but who subsequently went down for bribery and is only recently out of prison herself; she is in many ways an admirable person at base, trying hard to rediscover her place in a much more limited world with Arthur's help. As always, Turow also builds a complex but wholly believable mystery plot -- rather slowly at the beginning of the book but gathering speed by page 100 -- doling out reasonable clues but not really giving anything away. (This ain't Agatha Christie.) While the author still indulges in a number of minor but annoying grammatical idiosyncrasies, and often seems to have trouble making his verb tenses agree, I will continue to look forward eagerly to his next novel.	2003-01-02

This fourteenth novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series begins where the last one left off, with Jack, Stephen, and 157 crew members cast away on a  not-quite-desert island in the South China Sea, attempting to build a schooner from the remains of the wrecked DIANE. After time out for a game of sand-lot cricket (these are Brits, after all), they find themselves holding off a concerted attack by predatory Malays. O'Brian certainly knows how to start his story off with a bang! With a little fortuitous assistance, they make their way back to Batavia, and Gov. Raffles supplies them with a recently raised Dutch ship -- which Jack renames NUTMEG. They set off to rendezvous with the SURPRISE, with adventures and single-ship action along the way, and eventually make it to the penal colony at Botany Bay. O'Brian has some pointed and highly critical observations to make on the British governance of early Australia, and he also maintains his high standards of character development, wit in describing the relationship between the captain and the doctor -- their personalities are extremely differenent in many ways -- and beautifully painted pictures of life and weather at sea. This is one of the best so far of the latter part of the series.	2002-12-30

I also have, and still use, a number of the old Time-Life &quot;Foods of the World&quot; series, so I was predisposed to like it -- but apparently this one was simply acquired from Hamlyn/Octopus, a British publisher. The book is divided into &quot;Small Courses&quot; (finger foods, salads, and appetizers), &quot;Quick &amp; Easy,&quot; &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; (international recipes), and &quot;Entertaining,&quot; which includes more impressive and time-consuming projects, such as Chicken Galatine and Indian Spiced &amp; Roasted Chicken. I tried Chicken &amp; Orange Shells, which was quite good, and Jamaican Jerked Chicken, in which I made a number of substitutions off the shelf (such as for the allspice berries, which I've never even seen) and it came out quite good anyway. There's also an odd version of Jambalaya, which includes white wine and mussels instead of shrimp, and chorizo instead of tasso; I don't believe my culinary friends here in south Louisiana would countenance those changes! The photography is good (always a help when you're thinking about a new recipe) and ingredients and measurements are given in their U.S. equivalents rather than British.	2002-12-24

Jack gets his commission and seniority back, he's given the Diane (which he captured in the last book), and he takes aboard another envoy (who rates thirteen guns, hence the title). The French are in Pulo Prabang, too, in the persons of the traitors Wray and Ledward, and Maturin has his hands full, but they come to a delightfully bonechilling end under the doctor's scalpel.

This volume comprises volumes 14-19 in the series (as they were originally published), covering the back-story to and rise of Islam, the post-Roman history of Africa, the further development of China and India, and all the complexity of events taking place in Central Asia. Oh, yeah -- Europe, too! Actually, most of us with professional historian's training are still apt to think in European and North American terms, for which Gonick's work is a great antidote. He also puts paid to any notion of Islam being a \\"peaceful\\" religion -- no more than Christianity, certainly -- and readers with a knowledge of Jewish history also will be nodding at his witty but pointed renderings.

Frankly, I didn't have very high expectations for this twelfth installment in the saga of Capt. Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin; turning the Surprise into a privateer seemed to be merely scrambling for a plot twist. But, however (as they say), I was mistaken. O'Brian takes the opportunity to point up the significant social and operational differences between the national and private man-of-war, the superior attitudes of the &quot;real&quot; navy toward those not in blue and gold uniform, and the real advantages sometimes enjoyed by the privately financed operation. And he sensitively explores Jack's deep depression at being separated from the service. Moreover, we all know Jack's estrangement, the result of his engineered conviction on trumped-up charges of rigging the stock market, cannot last. And, indeed, his sobriquet of &quot;Lucky Jack&quot; comes to the fore as his first cruise, intended only as a two-week shakedown exercise in preparation for a surreptitiously government-backed diplomatic and intelligence-gathering expedition to the Pacific coast of South America, quickly turns into a triumphant procession of Franco-American prizes back to Plymouth. There are also several interesting sub-plots, including Stephen's reconciliation with his departed wife, Diana, and his gradual but unintentional weaning from his extreme opium habit via his Irish servant. I'm pleased to recommend this yarn as one of the best in the mid-part of this series. (But if you haven't read the previous four or five, you'll have no idea of what's going on.)	2002-12-20

The old SURPRISE is for the knackers -- she's been living on borrowed time for the past two volumes -- and Jack seems headed that way, too, after falling into a cunning trap that ends with him being roasted in a political show-trial for trying to manipulate the stock market. Stephen Maturin's fortunes, on the other hand, seem to be rising. He has found himself unexpectedly wealthy and he comes into information that answers the disturbing questions arising in his recent intelligence operations. As always, O'Brian shows himself a master of the details of early 19th century British society, language, and general style, . . . but his plotting is unfortunately becoming almost pro forma. A pretty good story, but far from his best.	2002-12-16

In his urbanely witty but sharply observant way, Fussell identifies much deeper distinctions: The Russian love of large shoulderboards, the 20th century German fascination with black, the Italian thing for plumes, and the different perception and philosophy between British class-conscious khaki and American egalitarian olive drab. And the essential reason army and navy uniforms are so very different: until the Cold War, the army and its uniforms were made up anew for each new major conflict, while the navy continued to exist much the same in peacetime as in wartime. But \\"uniform\\" means more than the military -- witness the ubiquity of blue jeans in the United States and, eventually, all over the world. Fussell also asks the questions most of us wouldn't have thought of, like why do British and American cops tend to dark blue uniforms, quite unlike the tradition in Continental countries? Why do commercial airline pilots wear uniforms at all? (The early ones didn't.) Why are UPS men considered sexy while FedEx guys aren't? And what was it with Elmo Zumwalt and Richard Nixon when it came to bizarre uniforms? This isn't a very long book, nor is it scholarly in style, but it's a lot of fun.

As O'Brian admits in his Introduction to this tenth volume in the Aubrey/Maturin series, he's beginning to run out of history; had he known the first novel would even *become* a series, he would have begun much earlier in Capt. Jack Aubrey's career. The result is that, where each of the earlier volumes was a self-contained narrative, with a few months, or even a few years, of dead space between it and the next, each of the most recent stories ends with a cliffhanger and seques directly into the next yarn. This one is also much more a story of maritime life and its hardships than a naval adventure, with Jack taking the JOYFUL SURPRISE out of the Mediterranean, down to the South Atlantic, around the Horn, and into the vast and still largely uncharted mid-Pacific in pursuit of the U.S. Navy's NORFOLK, sent to harrass the British whaling fleet. It's a long, hard, generally uncomfortable trek, with Aubrey and Maturin being marooned -- twice. There's also more of the soap opera element in this one, with a parallel story of onboard adultery and murder. For me, the most interesting episode is the pair's encounter with the feminist crew of a South Seas double-hulled ocean-going canoe. This volume is a lot of fun for the experienced reader of O'Brian's novels, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a reader new to the series.	2002-12-09

The town itself is dying, the families who used to have money have it no longer, and 11-year-old Harriet Cleve Dufresnes has decided to solve the mystery of who murdered her brother a decade before when he was the same age she is now -- and to punish the killer. I read Tartt's first novel, _The Secret History_, when it first appeared a decade ago. Bits and pieces of its scenes and characters have stuck with me -- always the sign of a good book -- so I was looking forward to this one . . . and it was largely worth the wait, but the slow pace can make it rather hard going in places. Again, her characterization is flawless, especially as regards the criminal Ratliff clan, with their drug-dealing and snake-handling. Actually, my only complaint, except for the book's snail-like pace, is Tartt's tendency to have Harriett behave in ways that seem more appropriate to a seven- or eight-year old than an adolescent. She often seems even younger than her 10-year-old male buddy, Hely, who idolizes her. Finally, I would be interested to see what Hollywood might so with this; it seems made for the silver screen.	2002-12-09

Last Christmas, someone decided I needed to expand my baking repertoire and gave me this book. It starts with the real basics -- white bread, egg bread, whole wheat, rye -- and works up to more complex recipes like &quot;Maple-Pecan Cornmeal Bread&quot; and &quot;Roasted Garlic and Stout Bread&quot; (made with dark beer). Many of them use the machine for only part of the process and still require you to punch down, etc -- and, frankly, I got a machine so I wouldn't have to do that stuff! Nevertheless, there are some really good machine-only recipes, especially &quot;Pepper-Parmesan Sourdough,&quot; &quot;Poppy Seed-Cranberry Bread,&quot; which is great for brakfast, and &quot;Garlic and Dried Tomato Bread,&quot; which is perfect with homemade minestrone. The instructions are easy and assorted helpful tips are scattered throughout.	2002-12-01

If the cookbook has &quot;gourmet&quot; in the title, or the recipe has a French name, it's probably not for me -- so this book was a very pleasant surprise. I have a feeling the editors have somewhat dumbed down more sophisticated recipes in order not to scare off people like me, but that's okay: I've found some really good dishes here. The &quot;Split Pea Soup with Bacon and Rosemary&quot; was a very tasty variation on an old favorite of mine, and the &quot;Cider-Brined Pork Chops with Leeks and Apples,&quot; which I fixed recently for a family birthday, got a lot of compliments. Some others, like &quot;Macaroni and Cheese with Red Peppers&quot; and &quot;Stir-Fried Chicken with Onion and Hoisin Sauce&quot; are definitely on my to-do list.

(sort of)	Captain Jack Aubrey was known in the Royal Navy as \\"Lucky Jack\\" in his earlier career, but he hasn't been so lucky of late. This ninth novel in the series, which continues immediately after _The Ionian Mission_ (and appears to be the middle installment of a mini-trilogy), is a satisfying mix of naval adventure, set mostly in the Red Sea, and spy story, set in Malta and revolving around Stephen Maturin's befriending of the young wife of a captured naval captain who is working, semi-unaware, for the French intelligence service. He's much better known to his enemies now than in times past, which has increased his personal danger greatly, and -- while we all know he's going to survive -- it's interesting to see how he does it. As always, O'Brian shows himself a master of early 19th century slang and jargon, and also of droll wit. The extra fillip this time is the pair's adventures crossing the desert between the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Suez, combined with Maturin's acquisition of a massive brass diving bell. And the account of the pellmell journey down the narrow passage in pursuit of a galley hopefully filled with French gold is one of the author's best extended scenes yet.	2002-11-29

Those ingredients, and similar, figure in a number of the admittedly tasty-looking dishes featured here, but there are also a number of others that are surprisingly simple and quite good -- at least, those I tried. Rather than the usual division into chapters by primary component, this book is organized into \\"Appetizers,\\" \\"After Work,\\" \\"Weekend Entertaining,\\" \\"Vegetables, Salads, & Accompaniments,\\" and \\"Desserts,\\" plus a final section called \\"The Basics,\\" which covers roasted garlic, pesto, basil coulis, bouquet garni, etc. I made the \\"Argula with Sauteed Potatoes & Bacon,\\" which was easy and excellent, and the \\"Pasta alla Diavola,\\" in which I included rather more dried chiles than called for, with great success. About one-third of the recipes are pictured (mouth-wateringly), and nearly all are accompanied by Chef's Tips and suggested variations. Except for the editors' somewhat boorish assumption that anything cooked in French fashion is better than anyone else's version -- even \\"Corn & Potato Chowder,\\" which is about as American as you can get -- this is an above-average cookbook which I shall return to regularly.	2002-11-26

Jack is doing a turn commanding a seventy-four-gun ship of the line in the blockade of Toulon on the French Mediterranean coast, a mostly cold, dreary, boring, enervating sort of warfare. The admiral he admires is wasting away from overwork and the vice-commander, Jack's old nemesis, tries to use him in a diplomatic feint which turns into a debacle, damaging his reputation among those of his crew who don't really know him and even making him doubt himself. Stephen is busy behind the scenes, sharing the secret limelight with Prof. Graham, an expert in all things Turkish. Finally, in a narratively somewhat disconnected incident, they are sent off to the Turkish-held Greek islands to undermine the French among the local beys and pashas. While it makes for interesting reading in depicting another, rather less dashing, side of the naval war against Napoleon, this volume is uncomfortably episodic and not at all one of O'Brian's best. I would definitely not recommend this as one's first novel in the series.	2002-11-24

Land ownership was rare in Sicily and conditions were crowded and unpleasant in the northeastern urban slums of the U.S., but in Louisiana the immigrants settled mostly in rural areas and quickly became the principal food producers for the state. They often were not welcomed, however, by those who came before, as in the infamous lynching of a dozen Italians who had been arrested but not charged following the murder of New Orleans Police Chief David Hennessey in October, 1890. Margavio and Salomone, both professors of sociology, have done an excellent job in depicting the gradual assimilation of Italians and their culture, from muffalettas and Roman Candy in New Orleans to Nick La Rocca's Original Dixieland Jazz Band and the activities of the Societa Italiana di Mutua Beneficenza Cefautana. There are today hundreds of thousands of Italian-Americans living in Louisiana and this book should be of interest to most of them.	2002-11-20

The style is smooth and engrossing (more so, admittedly, if the reader is predisposed to reading archival materials), and the advice is generally pretty good. There are interesting digressions into such subjects as dealing with your ancestors' words on topics that we today would regard as socially offensive. As in most Betterway publications, tips, notes, reminders, and warnings are emphasized throughout, and a selection of useful forms is included. The bibliography is lengthy and detailed and there's also a useful list of organizations, specialty publishers, and suppliers of archival products. However, I could wish that the index were more analytical: &quot;Archives and archivists&quot; includes ten rather broad locators with no subheadings, which is not very friendly to the user.	2002-11-20

Some in the Idiot's Guides series are pretty good, some are pretty dreadful; this one falls somewhere in the middle. Not all of his advice on locating an existing reading group is sound -- library-based groups are necessarily as open to the general public as those sponsored by chain bookstores -- nor is his advice to buy multiple new copies of books rather than used ones. He's much better on what makes for a successful new group -- how to choose members, how to choose which books to read, how to pace a discussion, and how to make sure everyone is included. And most of his thematic lists of books to consider are quite reasonable, except for the very short shrift he gives science fiction. (He seems to think \\"genre\\" fiction means primarily mystery novels.) My main complaint about this book is the cutesyness common to the whole series, but if can ignore that there's some pretty good stuff here.	2002-11-20

Despite several desvastating fires, a surprising amount of early architectural history remains, and this lush volume of pen-and-ink drawings of buildings and floorplans is notable as both history and art. An introductory section describes the sources and development of vernacular architecture in south Louisiana, the roles of wrought iron, brackets on shotgun houses, and the courtyard plan, and the influence of each succeeding cultural overlay. Then, arranged into chronological chapters, Vogt describes in some detail more than forty structures and locations, both public, like Jackson Square (originally la Place d'Armes) and the U.S. Mint (erected in 1838 on the site of Fort San Carlos), to private dwellings, including the Peyroux House (built c.1780), the Bosque House (1795), and the La Rionda-Correjolles House (c.1810)-- with a full discussion of generic building types and styles for each period. How many visitors to the Quarter are aware that Pat O'Brien?s inhabits what was once the townhouse of planter John Garner, or that Preservation Hall was the home of Madame Fanchon, a free woman of color, from 1817 to 1866, or that the Le Carpentier House on Chartres was not only the home of novelist Frances Parkinson Keyes and the birthplace of Paul Morphy but also the site of a series of murders by the Italian &quot;Black Hand&quot;? A glossary and selected bibliography will also be useful to the student, though an index would have been very handy as well. The author is well known among students of New Orleans architecture; his _New Orleans Houses: A House-Watcher's Guide_, now in its fifth printing, has become the standard reference.	2002-11-20

Dick and Raymond Chandler (actually, I think they meant Dashell Hammett), and that's pretty close. Conrad Metcalf is a gumshoe in the old noir mode, but in this near future -- or parallel present -- he's a \\"private inquisitor\\" in a world in which it's not only very rude but aggressively antisocial to ask questions, a world in which \\"evolved\\" animals have begun to fill the lower social niches (from a kittenish kitten and a P.I. gorilla to a dangerous kangaroo gunsel), a world in which an addictive psychoactive drug is not only tolerated but encouraged, and in which the karma credits on your card had better not run down to zero. All of this, frankly, is far more interesting than the somewhat lame murder plot, involving gangsters, addicts, crooked cops, and innocent bystanders who get vacuumed up. The concluding section, however, set six years later -- or three days, depending on your viewpoint -- shows that no matter how dark things may get, they can always get worse. Despite numerous recommendations of his work, this is the first novel I've read by Lethem, and even with the caveats given above, it's good enough to lead me to try more of his stuff.	2002-11-16

This volume is the third in a mini-trilogy within the larger Aubrey-Maturin series, and it's rather more given to personal and political rather than purely naval affairs. Again, it opens where the previous volume closed, with the victory of Shannon over the Chesapeake and the arrival of both at Halifax. While they're being feted by local society for the victory, Jack, in a peke over his lack of mail from home, gets carried away in an indiscretion with a local fortune-hunter, which haunts him for the rest of the book. Diana Villiers, meanwhile, has a parallel problem as a result of her liaison with Johnson in the previous volume. The three finally leave Canada for England on the packet carrying the great news, but are hotly pursued by a couple of American privateers apparently in Johnson's employ; he wants both his papers and his woman back. When they reach England, Steven's own intelligence coup leads to his being sent on a mission to the Baltic, where he must convince a Catalan contingent to desert the Napoleonic cause, and this whole episode is one of the most interesting I've read yet. In the latter stages of the mission, however, Jack and Steven find themselves in the clutches of the French, and then in prison in Paris, and Steven's talents are called for again. This one is more a spy adventure than a sea story, but it's very enjoyable for all that. (It took me an embarrassingly long time to catch on to the title, though.)	2002-11-16

The previous volume ended with the orchestrated escape of Mrs. Wogan and Michael Herapath from Desolation Island in an American whaler, and the reader knew that &quot;the horrible old LEOPARD&quot; was about to forge on, too, having managed to replace her destroyed rudder. This volume begins in late 1812, with the LEOPARD limping into harbor in the East Indies, with only a sentence or two given to the fate of Gov. William Bligh in Australia -- which didn't strike me as quite fair. The historical Bligh is a very interesting personality. However. The LEOPARD is good now only as a transport, and Jack Aubrey has been told of a nice frigate awaiting his command on his return to England, so he and Dr. Maturin and their followers take homebound passage with an old acquaintance of Jack's. It's a lovely voyage as far as the mid-Atlantic, but then events catch up with them, and they find themselves in a small boat struggling to reach the coast of Brazil. They're rescued by the JAVA -- which is then taken by the CONSTITUTION, the third British frigate to fall to the small U.S. Navy in a very short time. Very depressing for our heroes, but O'Brian doesn't hesitate to laud the abilities of the American seamen and commanders. Maturin and the wounded Jack end up as prisoners of war in Boston, where Stephen Maturin's intelligence activities against Napoleonic France come back to haunt him, and where he joins up again with Diana Villiers, Herapath (father and son), and Louisa Wogan. The focus is more on Maturin in this book than in most of the others (so far), and he shows himself to be quite cold-blooded when necessary in pursuit of his covert objectives. Escape from Boston becomes necessary when it becomes obvious that no exchange is contemplated for them, and they make their way to the SHANNON, which is maintaining the blockade of Boston Harbor, and which sends in a gentlemanly challenge to the CHESAPEAKE to come out and fight -- all of which is historically accurate, though strange to modern notions of warfare. And that brief but epic engagement is where this volume ends, with an obvious segue into the next. The earlier volumes were generally self-contained narratives, with a period of unremarked time passing between them, but the present novels cover too great a series of events to be dealt with properly in a single volume. And the greater the impact they have on history, the more Jack tends to recede into a secondary position -- which is only fair, since O'Brian didn't want to perturb the historical record too greatly. I enjoyed this volume in the series rather more than the last one, perhaps because I'm more knowledgeable than most about the early National period in the U.S. and the War of 1812 in particular. O'Brian does an excellent, balanced job of describing the local political situation in New England, and his powers of characterization are as strong as ever.nge to modern notions of warfare.

I've been reading the Aubrey-Maturin series straight through, from the first volume. While it has one of the most exciting battle scenes and some of the absorbing problems to be solved I've yet<br />encountered, this is also, untimately, the most frustrating of the first five volumes. Jack Aubrey, having given up his commodore's pendant at the end of the Mauritius campaign, is back to being a post captain, this time commanding the slow, aging _Leopard_ on a voyage to relieve the embattled Gov. William Bligh in Australia. For reasons of state security, he must also transport a batch of convicted felons, among whom is an American women strongly suspected of spying for the United States, and he must deal with an intellectual young man who has stowed away aboard to be close to Mrs. Wogan. Virtually the whole story takes place aboard the one ship, so the author has the opportunity to investigate his characters in great depth -- always one of his strongest points. The only real naval action, a prolonged stern chase in horrible weather, in which _Leopard_ must flee from the much stronger _Waakzaamheid,_ a Dutch 72-gun ship, is absolutely riveting, as is its sudden and tragic resolution. Then there are the icebergs. But when the book ends, _Leopard_ is still a thusand miles or more from New South Wales and Bligh is nowhere in sight. &quot;Ah,&quot; I thought, &quot;it's a two-parter.&quot; But it isn't, because I peeked at the next volume. I don't believe O'Brian has enitirely played fair with the reader this time, and it annoys me not to know what happened in the rest of  Aubrey's commission.	2002-11-06

This fourth novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series shows more narrative unity than the first three, which is partly a function of Jack Aubrey's now-exalted rank. As a newly promoted commander in a small sloop, and even as a post captain, he was at the beck of more senior officers. Now, as commodore in command of a squadron of several ships-of-the-line and lesser warships, plus a small herd of transports and Indiamen crowded with troops, he has reached a position of high command, with orders to capture the French outpost islands of Mauritius and La Reunion in the Indian Ocean. As Dr. Maturin privately notes in his diary, Jack was probably happier as a junior officer, with only his own ship and men in his direct responsibility; now he must manage other ships's captains at one remove, deal diplomatically with the Army, and oversee the installation of a new British governor. O'Brian hews closely to historical fact in narrating this little-known but complex campaign, and he also delves more deeply into the psychology of the supporting characters -- especially Lord Clonfort, a not unintelligent but very unhappy young commander apparently afflicted with bipolar disorder, who constantly seeks the approval of his own subordinates as well as his seniors. As true historical fiction, this volume is, for me, the most enjoyable in the series yet.	2002-11-02

This is the third novel in the Jack Aubrey-Stephen Maturin series, and the story just keeps rolling right along. It's difficult to maintain the pace and the reader's interest for more than the first couple of volumes in any sort of fiction series, but O'brian certainly has the knack. This time, the newly-posted but still heavily indebted Captain Aubrey is detailed to ferry a diplomat to the court of an Indian prince . . . having been the unknowing beneficary of Maturin's leverage at the Admiralty. He's impatient at being out of the principal theater of the war with France, but happy to have any ship at all -- especially the frigate SURPRISE, in which he had served as a midshipman. Besides helping his friend, Dr. Maturin has his own reasons for visiting India -- Diana Villiers has gone there in the company of a wealthy merchant from the City and the East India Company. For O'Brian spends as much time on the details and development of his characters' personal interrelationships as he does on naval maneuvering and battles. And the descriptions of rounding the Cape of Good Hope are mesmerizing!	2002-10-29

In fact, Hornby's dry and droll style is almost the epitome of English humorous fiction. Will Lightman, whose father wrote a classic pop Christmas tune and set up his son for life, is devoted to a life of idleness, coolness, and the pursuit of women. Will's not really an unlikable person -- merely a shallow one. He decides that single mothers are a target group he hasn't tried yet and invents a son so he can join a support group. This leads him to an acquaintance with Marcus, a rather nerdish twelve-year-old whose mother has made him a vegetarian and Joni Mitchell fan, and who has no idea who Kurt Cobain is (the story is set in 1990). Marcus adopts Will as a role model who can teach him all the things his depressive mother cannot. And Will eventually falls in love -- but not (surprisingly) with Will's mother -- and finds it necessary to change his life in important ways. This is a delightfully witty, sweet, and insightful book about the London middle class, the teenage world of the early '90s, and the relationships between men and women of all ages.	2002-10-29

Of the sixty-odd pieces in this collection, almost all of them first published in _The New Yorker_, I'd previously read maybe one-third, especially the more famous and heavily anthologized ones like &quot;The Swimmer.&quot; But my favorites are those in which Cheever experimented with style and content, like &quot;The Enormous Radio&quot; and &quot;The Country Husband&quot; and &quot;The Wrysons&quot; and &quot;Goodbye My Brother.&quot; Cheever invented the &quot;New York story&quot; in which the characters are ordinary people living generally ordinary lives, but by whom the reader becomes fascinated. And the last paragraph always seems to tie up the narrative in a neat surgical knot. Amazingly good stuff.	2002-10-29

Subtitled \\"A Lexicon and Companion to the Complete Seafaring Tales of Patrick O'Brian,\\" this is an absolutely marvelous book, the Third Edition of which includes references to all twenty of the Aubrey-Maturin novels. It scores high in the first test given any alphabetically organized reference book, viz., in looking up an entry, ... There's a wide variety of nautical jargon, period medical terminology, the characters' references to natural history and music, and the foreign words and phrases that crop up in the novels. O'Brian describes a large number of real personages, too, all of whom are succinctly biographed. There's also a pretty detailed timeline for the period 1793-1818, a narrative essay on the ins and outs of the Napoleonic wars, a most illuminating discussion of naval medicine and surgery in Maturin's day, and a nice series of period illustrations of ships and boats for those who can't tell a frigate from a corvette, nor a barge from a launch. This is definitely a book to keep at hand while you work your way through the series.	2002-10-23

And while there have been a great many books written about the three Tudor generations in power, not much has been published in accessible form on their deeply Welsh roots. Professor Griffiths pays special attention to the activities of Henry Tudor and his near relatives in exile, of particular interest (to me) are the several excellent chapters on the Celtic genesis of the family, the connection with Owen Glendower, and the marriage connections they established.	2002-10-23

This is the second in the Aubrey-Maturin series and it's a far more broadly painted picture than the first; also, a great deal more of the action takes place ashore. Jack finds himself out of a command due to the peace, but having come into a large sum of prize money, he rents a country place and takes up riding to hounds. He also meets Sophie and her family, and the Doctor meets Sophie's cousin, Diana. Relationships become interestingly complicated, but then Jack's prize agent defaults and two of his prizes are ruled invalid, and he suddenly finds himself deep in debt. The two go abroad to escape a debt judgment and they're visiting Spain when war breaks out again. After a period disguised as a trained bear accompanying its trainer, they reach Gibralter and take ship, only to be captured. And so it goes, with Maturin having taken up his additional avocation by this time as an intelligence agent for the Admiralty. In fact, his connections are about the only thing that keeps Jack in his series of commands against the competition, and after a particularly gallant action, he finally gets made post. All in all, this is a far more interesting book, with a great deal more character development, than the first book. Young Sophia is especially nicely drawn, and Jack himself (as Stephen notes) has begun to mature in important ways. In fact, my only complaint is in respect to the wretched cover illustration in the original hardcover edition!	2002-10-23

It's interesting to compare Commander Jack Aubrey to Horatio Hornblower and Richard Bolitho, whom I have long considered the most successful fictional naval heroes of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Actually, Aubrey is only nominally a &quot;hero,&quot; being a much more human individual than the other two. In fact, while a notable seaman and a resourceful tactician, in many other respects he can be a thoughtless and blundering dunderhead, down on Whigs and Catholics, and with a tendency to be led by his own bowsprit where the ladies are concerned. But O'Brian certainly has invented a fully rounded character and put the reader inside his head. Even more interesting, though, is Dr. Stephen Maturin, a creature of the Enlightenment, reared in Catalonia -- physician, natural scientist, Irish ex-revolutionary, and, in the later books, secret intelligence agent for the British government. Maturin is worldly, liberal, and fearless in expressing his opinion, though he also has his narrownesses. He also is an absolute naif when it comes to marine matters, which makes him an excellent foil for whose benefit (as well as the reader's) everything must be explained. The greatest difference between O'Brian and his predecessors, perhaps, is this author's narrative style which (not even counting the nautical jargon) makes much heavier use than most of the idiom and cant of the day. It never becomes un-understandable, though. But I do have a small complaint: Now that O'Brian is gone, we shall never know the details of Aubrey's earlier career, to which some fascinating and intriguing references are made here.	2002-10-16

Bolitho begins the spring of 1777 as Fourth Lieutenant in the eighty-gun Trojan lying in New York harbor. Because of the death in action of one of his superiors and the capture of another, he ends as Second Lieutenant and then, to his surprise, as prize master of a captured American brig -- during the operation of which he manages to grab yet another enemy ship, which is more than enough to give him his step to Commander in the next book! Bolitho is an officer in the Hornblower mode -- self-possessed, self-critical, and sometimes prey to self-doubts -- which is to say, he's closer in some ways to a late-20th century man than a true denizen of the 18th century (like O'Brien's Jack Aubrey). The chracterizations are carefully done and the action is clearly described without being overly technical (also a difference from O'Brien). Note: I personally find series like this more interesting when the characters are younger and lower in rank, fighting smaller vessels. Flag rank tends to remove the officer -- and the reader's viewpoint -- too far from the \\"front lines.\\"	2002-10-14

C. S. Forester is still the standard against which I measure later creations, and Alexander Kent stands up very well in that regard. I always try to work out a birthdate for the main character in such a series, so I'll have some idea of the future course of his history and what real events he's likely to bump into. Hornblower was born in 1776, Jack Aubrey around 1770 (I think), and Richard Bolitho in 1756 -- which pretty much takes him out of the later Napoleonic period except as a very senior officer (the last book in the series is set in 1806). Things were quite different at that relatively early period as regards press gangs, construction of ships, international politics, and lots of other factors, which adds to the interest. Specifically, Bolitho is eighteen years old and a newly-appointed Third Lieutenant aboard the Destiny, a frigate armed for war during a time of peace, whose captain is frothing to lay hold of a would-be revolutionary hiding out in the Caribbean. Which provides plenty of room for Bolitho to develop his naval and leadership skills, to become infatuated with another man's wife, and acquire friendships that will last a lifetime -- especially with Stockdale, who will later become his cox'n. The prose is workmanlike and the author spends almost as much time delineating the characters of Captain Dumaresq, First Lieutenant Palliser, and Second Lieutenant Rhodes, all of whom are interesting, and which greatly increases the reader's enjoyment.	2002-10-03

Hardly anyone outside the industry itself has a high opinion of advertising, and I'm probably no different -- most of the time. However, I've long appreciated the occasional high degree of originality and wit of which ad writers and artists have shown themselves capable, especially since the late 1950s. This fat volume brings all of them together, beginning with Volkwagen's groundbreaking &quot;Think Small&quot; campaign. There are chapters on the influence of European copywriting on American ads, the development of a new &quot;visual language,&quot; the rise of backhanded &quot;oddvertising,&quot; the growth of advertising as a reflection of (and finally an agent of) social change, and the advent of guerilla anti-advertising, each of them an entertaining and instructive mix of graphics and text. There's even a separate chapter on the ups and downs of the famous and long-running &quot;Got Milk?&quot; campaign. This gorgeous book will keep you studying the artwork and reading the discussions far into the night.	2002-10-02

The local land-poor squire, an ignorant boor who beats his wife, tries to get a free valuation of some family pictures from them and Martin discovers what he believes to be a long-lost Bruegel -- a find that not only would make his career but would be worth several million pounds. Naturally, he has to possess it. And that draws him into a convoluted (but perfectly believable, earlier reviews of this book not withstanding) scheme to con his neighbor out of the unrecognized masterpiece . . . for the painting's own good, of course. That's the surface story, a very entertaining sort of bedroom farce it is. But Martin's wife, an iconographer who hasn't seen the picture, doesn't for a moment believe it could be what he thinks it is, so Martin must research the attribution -- a quest that takes him and us through the ins and outs of 16th century Dutch and Spanish politics, the Reformation and the Catholic counterattack, and the possible personal trials of the painter himself. I \\"read\\" this one on a recent trip via audiobook, read by British actor Robert Powell, and it may be one of those few books that's better listened to than read. Though my art background is minimal, I found the scholarly detective work and Martin's thought processes absorbing.

I decided forty years was long enough to wait before re-reading it . . . and while, with more education and a lot more \\"life experience\\" under my belt, I certainly appreciate these stories more than I did then, I'm still not really in love with Salinger. Especially \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish,\\" which everyone seems to regard as the perfect modern American short story -- sorry, it doesn't do a thing for me. Seymour is just rather ... I think, not tragic. On the other hand, \\"Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut\\" and \\"For Esme -- with Love and Squalor\\" are beautifully done character portraits. And \\"De Daumier-Smith's Blue Period\\" is flat falling-down funny. The others fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum for me. Salinger certainly has a knack for dialogue, though some of the conversations in these stories seem funny now simply because they're written in fifty-year-old idiom. And, of course, nineteen-year-old characters then seem far more naive than fifteen-year-olds of today. But even making those allowances, for modern short fiction I consider William Trevor, Ellen Gilchrist, and Frederick Barthelme to be far more talented.	2002-09-26

A desert planet with an ancient history of very un-Earth-like life, a frontier world that mixes social conservatism and radical experimentation, this is Mars in the late 22nd century. Casseia Majumdar is, she thinks, an ordinary person just trying to find her niche in life, beginning with student rebellion against Statism and progressing through her emergence as a key leader in a redesigned Martian political system. Parallelling her own development is the rise of Charles Franklin, her first lover and theoretical physicist extraordinaire. In its theme and style, this story reminds me most of John Varley's _Steel Beach_ and Heinlein's _The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_ -- but while it has all the exciting detail and deep, rich texture of the former, it's far more subtle and sophisticated than anything Heinlein ever managed. The feel of the world's overwhelming strangeness and almost unimaginable complexity 175 years from now is accomplished very smoothly, almost sneakily, without ever overexplaining things. The physics &quot;feels&quot; right. And the characterization is always spot-on. And the title of this thing should be taken literally. Putting it simply and baldly, this is a perfectly marvelous book. It is by far the best thing of Bear's I've read and it's one of the best sf novels I've read by *anyone* in several years.	2002-09-16

As Bohnaker so thoroughly demonstrates, they aren't even like *they* think they are. The essential European (and therefore American) mind-set is rational, based on ancient Greece, Rome, the Medieval Church, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution. Westerners ask &quot;why?&quot; The Japanese share none of that history and depend instead on pattern, and especially formula. They ask &quot;what?&quot; For society to work, everyone simply has to behave the same way, every time, in the expected fashion. The famous Japanese consensus is not a rational principal, &quot;wisely deduced from the need to produce cooperative action&quot; -- that?s a Western extrapolation. Where society in the West is supported by an internal structure of reason and principal, what he calls the Japanese social psyche is held together by a &quot;bubble of agreement supported by nothing but itself.&quot; And who decides what people should agree to? Tradition and authority, more often than not. American soldiers were baffled at the end of World War II when the &quot;maniacal&quot; Japanese simply ceased fighting, virtually overnight, and became polite and friendly. But they quit because the Emperor told them to, just as they had previously fought tooth and nail because the generals told them to. Of course, those in authority -- political leaders, the corporate boss -- frequently take advantage of this mind-set for their own ends. The author examines the Japanese educational system, the attitude toward public drunkenness, the real reason behind anarchic driving behavior (inability to identify authority), and the casual racism endemic in Japan, and a great deal more. However, when this book was published in 1990, as a result of years of a strong yen and much wider exposure to Western ways of doing things, the Japanese, especially the younger generation and the women, were beginning to resist their own traditions. It would be very interesting if Bohnaker were to write a follow-up volume a decade later, now that Japan has suffered serious economic setbacks.interesting if Bohnaker were to write a follow-up volume a decade later, now that Japan has suffered serious economic setbacks.	2002-09-08

This third novel in the series about BIA criminal investigator Emmett Parker, a Comanche, and FBI agent Anna Turnipseed, a Modoc, doesn't seem nearly as well organized as the first two. There are also unexplained overtones of supernatural involvement which grate, compared to the thoroughly realistic treatment of events in their earlier cases. This time, they're off to Oregon to &quot;keep the peace&quot; during the brouhaha that follows the discovery of what is apparently a Caucasoid skeleton nearly 15,000 years old. This has major political implications for the rights of Native Americans as &quot;original inhabitants,&quot; and the scientific community isn't happy about the pressure put on by the Warm Springs Reservation for immediate reburial of the remains. Thaddeus Rankin, renowned anthropologist, has his own cultural and political agenda. And underlying everything is the tension between Emmett and Anna as they try to get their personal relationship off the ground. Some of this is well handled, especially the true causes of Rankin's medical condition, but Mitchell also seems perfectly happy with the antiscientific superstition and politically correct religious bigotry behind NAGPRA -- the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.

Sawyer postulates a truly far-reaching point-of-divergence -- the rise to intelligence of Homo neanderthalensis instead of Homo sapiens. What's more, he makes a pretty good case for the physics behind his parallel worlds. It all starts in a deep nickel mine in northern Ontario which in our world is a neutrino observation lab and in the alternate Neanderthal world is a quantum computer lab. Ponter Boddit, physicist in that other world, falls through into our own world quite by accident, and the story is off and running. Because not only does Ponter have to figure out this world (and we have to accept what he is), his co-worker and house-mate, Adikor Huld, finds himself accused of murdering Ponter, who has mysteriously disappeared from their world. Sawyer is very good at thinking of all the problems and questions a reader is likely to raise and answering them satisfactorily -- in terms of the story, that is, though most of his speculations, even, seem like reasonably good science. He describes an internally consistent Neanderthal world, in which the Agricultural Revolution never took place and so the world's population is far smaller and more dispersed, which also means disease is much less prevalent. Because males and females live separate lives most of the time, nearly all individuals have both a man-mate and a woman-mate, one for affection and companionship, the other also for procreation. Menstruation occurs for all females at once, always on the same schedule, and children are born in planned generations, once every ten years. And, as one would expect, the Neanderthal world is more advanced in some ways than ours, and vice versa -- which also gives the author the opportunity to let us look at our own world through the eyes of an intelligent and sophisticated but mostly alien being. In fact, I expect there to be a backlash against this book by the Religious Right, because Ponter has some forthright things to say about the nature and effect of religion in our world -- an unnecessary psychological tension his world has been spared. As always, Sawyer also develops fully realized characters, with some cogent comments on the nature of intelligence, love, violence, and interpersonal relationships.

Physicists usually don't make good novelists, and vice versa. But there are exceptions and Egan is one of them. His latest is set some 20,000 years in our future, a universe in which death is only \\"local\\" because everyone backs themselves up regularly, in which you might or might not choose to have a body, in which gender has ceased to have any meaningful role in human affairs. Most people still prefer to remain on whatever planet they were born on, but some become travelers, and Tchicaya is one of those -- 4,000+ years old, rootless, a generalist. Six hundred years before, a \\"quantum graph\\" experiment went awry and a region of peculiar vacuum was created that has been expanding at half-light-speed ever since, swallowing up solar systems whose inhabitants have had to evacuate. But there's a ship filled with scientists staying just a little ahead of the expanding front, studying the novo-vacuum's effect and looking for a way to control it. Tchicaya joins the company on the ship, who have divided into two political-philosophical groups; he's part of the group called Yielders, who want to continue to study the novo-vacuum, as opposed to the Preservationists, who want to destroy it to prevent it from continuing to destroy them. And then a small radical faction takes action on its own. You'd think choosing sides in such a dichotomy would be a no-brainer, but Egan makes an excellent case for a truly civilized approach to the universe. The science and math is thick and sometimes heavy, but he manages not only to make it palatable but also enthralling.	2002-08-17

This is another of those books that has been on my to-read list for years, which people regularly recommended but which I kept pushing down the list . . . probably because I've never been particularly partial those other works of Waugh's which I've read -- superficial and stilted parodies like _Decline and Fall,_ _Vile Bodies,_ and _The Loved One._ But _Brideshead_ is, happily, quite different and shows Waugh at what I take to be his best. Charles Ryder, artist and scion of a minor upper class family, is a captain during World War II whose unit is posted to a large estate (Brideshead), a place where he spent some of the happiest, and unhappiest, times of his life back in the early 1920s, when he was at Oxford with Sebastian Flyte, the younger son of the wealthy and Catholic Marchmain family. The first part of the book is the story of the rise and fall of the friendship between Ryder and Sebastian, who hates his mother and sinks into alcoholism. The second part, which seems disconnected, is the story of Charles's success and the collapse of his marriage, and of his tenuous affair with Julia, Sebastian's sister. And that's about all the plot there is. But I enjoyed the book mostly for Waugh's mastery of character evolution, his depiction of the changes in Sebastian's grasp on the real world and on the growth of Ryder's cynicism. The supporting characters are fascinating: Sebastian's eldest brother, Brideshead (a lovely name!); the younger, pious sister, Cordelia; their friends, Anthony Blanche and Boy Mulcaster, who grow from tiresome undergraduates to men occasionally worth listening to; Julia's Canadian husband, Rex Mottrom; Sebastian's parents and Charles's father, and even quite minor figures in the story. There are also some great comic scenes, such as the thoroughly heathenish Rex's efforts to be converted to Roman Catholicism to please Julia's family, and Cousin Jasper's disquisition on how to be a proper Oxford Man. And Waugh's take on the peculiarities of the Anglo-Catholic world are very good. On the other hand, few of these characters are actually worth the reader's sympathy; they all have far too much money and the associated freedom to do just as they please, and none of them ever contributes much, if anything, to society at large.Anglo-Catholic world are very good.

There are thirteen stories in this collection, including some that are quite good, but are these really the \\"best\\"? Gregory Benford's \\"To the Storming Gulf\\" is particularly weak, especially the last section, and \\"Wolf Time\\" is far from Walter Jon Williams's best. Poul Anderson's \\"Among Thieves\\" is a true classic, though, as are \\"The Game of Rat and Dragon,\\" by Cordwainer Smith, and Phil Dick's \\"Second Variety.\\" As in the Alternate History volume, Turtledove seems to have difficulty with his definitions. \\"Wolf Time\\" is about an assassin, not warfare. George R. R. Martin's \\"Night of the Vampyres\\" is about political revolution with an only vaguely military element. And I can't see classifying McCaffrey's \\"Dragonrider\\" as military fiction at all. Finally (also as in the other volume), there are several novelette-length pieces -- Joe Haldeman's \\"Hero\\" (which became _The Forever War_), Card's \\"Ender?s Game\\" (which also became a novel), McCaffrey's \\"Dragonrider\\" (ditto), and C. J. Cherryh's \\"The Scapegoat\\" -- which should have been omitted in favor of twice that many additional short stories. This anthology could have been much better thought out.	2002-07-31

Each of the beautifully illustrated chapters deals with one aspect of the Japanese approach to the visual -- fashion, architecture, interiors, food and drink, transport, consumer products, housewares, communication and packaging, and transport -- and the author gives as much attention to the social psyhology behind Japanese traditions and interpretations as to the art and design itself, examining Japan's communitarian aspects and the tension between colorful individualism and finely developed herd instinct.

It's a gorgeous piece of work, with as much attention given to the text as to the pictures, tracing the Academy from its floundering first few years, to the sixteen-year reign of Superintendent Sylvanus Thayer (the true father of the school), through the classes that supplied most of the leaders on both sides of the Civil War (who all had served together in the War with Mexico), through the long years leading up to World War I. Fifty-nine of the cadets in the Class of 1915 (\\"the Class the Stars Fell On\\") became general officers, and one became president. During the later days of the Vietnam War, cadets seldom left the school, they were so badly treated by civilians their own age, and there were several major cheating scandals -- the author doesn?t whitewash any of that stuff -- but the Academy, having revised itself almost continuously for two centuries -- seems to be coming back. This is a beautiful book.	2002-07-27

I guess I'm too avid a reader of \\"alternate history\\" to expect to find anything in an anthology of previously-published stories I haven't read several times before, and that's the case here. But are these the \\"best\\"? Yeah, some of them. Kim Stanley Robinson's \\"The Lucky Strike\\" certainly is, and so is \\"Moon of Ice\\" by Brad Linaweaver, and Jack Chalker's \\"Dance Band on the Titanic\\" is one of my favorites. But Susan Schwartz's \\"Suppose They Gave a Peace,\\" while it's a pretty good story, was published less than a year before this book was compiled, which simply isn't enough time for any story to become a classic. Others really don't seem to fit the theme: Larry Niven's \\"All the Myriad Ways\\" is an exercise in philosophy/psychology in which alternate history plays only a small, background role. \\"Mozart in Mirrorshades,\\" by Bruce Sterling and Lew Shiner, while also a good story, is time travel, not alternate history, and Allan Steele's \\"The Death of Captain Future\\" has nothing to do with it at all. I think Harry also made a mistake by including Ward Moore's truly classic \\"Bring the Jubilee,\\" which is a novella, not a short story, and takes up a quarter of the book; that space would have been better allocated to one of the pieces from _What If_, or some other story from earlier in the century, since Moore's is the only story that predates the late 1960s, and most of these were published only in the 1980s or later.	2002-07-27

Fischer wrote _Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America,_ which is one of the best works published in several decades in comparative and local U.S. history, and in many ways this is a continuation of the &quot;Virginia&quot; section of that book. Which is a bit surprising, since the author is a New Englander and previously showed considerable preference for the folkways of Massachusetts over those in the South. Since I have numerous forebears in Virginia, I was particularly interested in the first three chapters: &quot;Migration to Virginia,&quot; &quot;Migration in Virginia,&quot; and &quot;Migration beyond Virginia.&quot; All of those apply to my people and Fischer's coverage of the in-through-and-out process is first-rate. As before, he's an old-fashioned historian, spending a lot of time describing the concrete experiences of particular individuals and families, not spinning out historiographical theory. This is a must-read for anyone interested in Virginia's first couple of centuries.	2002-07-27

Nothing stands still, but some alterations can be especially dramatic. Many parts of downtown New Orleans in the 1920s and '30s hadn?t changed significantly in several generations, except for the addition of overhead wires. This lavish volume will bring you up to date, displaying before-and-after shots of many fondly remembered locations -- such as the intersection of Madison Street and Decatur in what used to be &quot;Little Italy.&quot; A 1906 photo shows a decaying Creole townhouse which then housed a clothing store, and Madame Begue's famous restaurant across the narrow street. On the facing page, the 1996 view from exactly the same perspective shows the townhouse changed almost beyond recognition, but the 1830 building across the street, now the home of Tujague's Restaurant, which has been cleaned up and renovated (and is one of my favorites!), retains nearly all of its original design features. Other sites remind us of the days of parking your car on Canal Street's neutral ground, of the 1840s Greek Revival hidden behind the Sanlin Building's aluminum facade, of the gradual but continual decay of the De La Ronde plantation house in Chalmette. Other structures have disappeared entirely: The Poydras Market, St. Paul's Episcopal Church, and the entire 300 block of South Rampart Street, among many others, most of them replaced by freeways and modern motels. This would be a terrific book to send to that New Orleans-born relative who moved to California years ago.	2002-07-23

Family visits to sites like Stone Mountain and Peachtree Creek cemented his interest, as did the many CSA markers in the small country cemetery where his grandfather was buried. (The title of this book comes from the epitaph on his great-grandmother's headstone.) His family also encouraged an abiding interest in his own genealogy. After graduating from LSU, his career path led to the army, the eventual rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, and a tour as professor of history at the Military Academy at West Point -- and the confluence of these interests and traditions make him perhaps uniquely qualified to write this fascinating combination of military and family history. The author's grandfather, Henry Gordon Mangham, probably was named for General John B. Gordon, who rose from captain of volunteers to Lee?s only non-West Point corps commander. Henry's own grandfather had served in a Georgia Sharpshooter battalion in the Army of Tennessee and two of his great-uncles had fought in the 13th Georgia Infantry, a unit which not only helped make Gen. Gordon's reputation but which also suffered the second-highest casualty rate of any regiment at Sharpsburg/Antietam. Both uncles, in fact, had been seriously wounded there. Many Mangham cousins also served in the War and at least five never returned home. However, the author goes on to discuss the experiences and activities of dozens of other units from seven Southern states and this fat volume will be of considerable interest to any serious Civil War historian or hobbyist. But that's not all! Nearly half the book presents a detailed and extremely well-documented history of the Mangum / Mangram / Mangham family beginning with the marriage of John Mangum to Frances Bennett in Isle of Wight County, Virginia about 1694, and following their migrations first to North Carolina and eventually to Georgia about 1790, with some branches of the family moving on to Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. Some 500 Manghams and their offspring are brought together in a seven-generation Descendant Report, which includes cross-references to the main text, a very handy feature. Col.

This time he mines the PRO's vast collection of papers dealing with American Loyalist Claims. (The National Genealogical Society attempted this as long ago as 1980, but they managed to abstract only thirty-seven boxes of papers -- out of 150 -- before funding dried up.) The first claims were made following depredations against property owned by Loyalists by mobs opposing the Stamp Act of 1765 and they resumed ten years later and continued throughout the Revolution. The papers themselves vary widely, &quot;from one-liners jotted on a dirty scrap of paper to immaculately penned essays and printed expositions,&quot; and Coldham has examined and extracted key data from all of them. An introductory essay describes the conditions under which applications for relief were made and the problems encountered by those who made them. Proving residence and ownership of property apparently was the major stumbling block in dealing with the Claims Commission's bureaucracy in London. A large part of many of the memorials examined was the applicant's elaborate protestations of loyalty to the Crown, which have been deleted. Unfortunately for some readers, Coldham seems also to have eliminated the details of British military service included in many others. However, complete citations to the originals are included in each alphabetical abstract for followup research. If you haven't found DAR-type service for your late-18th century ancestor, you will want to peruse this volume. And of special interest to those of us here in Louisiana are the three dozen relief applications submitted by those residing in West Florida.	2002-07-23

The essentials of family research are generally the same, of course, and this well-written book reflects that -- but there are also a great many special considerations, techniques, and applications of old ideas that Woodtor presents clearly and in detail. Several chapters lay out the basic principles for the novice: Working backward from the living generation, moving from the known to the unknown, developing good research habits, checking all the sources, and so on. But they also point out the importance of oral tradition among African-American families, the necessity of identifying the last slave owner, and the tendency among many families to &quot;disremember&quot; unpleasant periods or relationships in the past. The author also relies on anecdotes, mostly from her own family, to illustrate the research process and to warn of special problems the researcher may encounter. A number of important topics are discussed at length, most of which I had only the most superficial knowledge of. Among these were the several extended exoduses during the 19th and early 20th centuries, including the great out-migration from Edgefield County, South Carolina to Tennesse, Arkansas, and (via Charleston) to Liberia; the &quot;exodusters&quot; movement of 1878-1879 from most of the Od South to Kansas and the Midwest; and the effects of World War I on the formation of a Black artisan and middle-class. Even searching the censuses of 1870-1920 brings special problems for the African-American researcher, since race was often incorrectly reported and surnames often changed over time. Another important consideration is possible enlistment in the United States Colored Troops during the Civil War; this is especially true for Louisiana (my special research area), which supplied more enlistees than any other state, North or South. There are several rules to keep in mind in working your way back before 1865: The smaller the slave owner, the fewer the records created. Rather than analyzing nuclear families, one will be looking at lists of slaves in an effort to reconstruct kinship ties. The general principle of working slowly from the present to the past tends to break down in slave research, with very wide gaps between records. In order to understand the movement and selling of more than one million slaves in the South between 1790 and 1860, one must understand the principles and mechanics of the slave trade. And, perhaps most important, the genealogy of slaves is the genealogy of slave owners. The author also explains the reasons behind &quot;protective&quot; slavery and slave ownership by free Blacks, the place of free Blacks in the North before the Civil War, and the question of American Indian ancestry among African-Americans. Several closing chapters discuss special topics, including Caribbean ancestry, sources of African-American institutional records, genealogical research at family reunions, and what to do with your research. I highly recommend this volume to any and all genealogists, regardless of race or ethnicity.y back before 1865: The smaller the slave owner, the fewer the records created.

Generally, the farther back in time one goes, the more difficult reading original documents is likely to be. Kip Sperry (who is Certified, Accredited, and a Fellow of three national genealogical societies, as well as an experienced teacher) has addressed this problem by bringing together in this book a wide variety of examples of penmanship for the reader to practice on. However, he limits himself to only early American handwriting in English, so one will find only limited assistance here in deciphering colonial Louisiana records in French and Spanish (which is of particular interest to me, unfortunately). An introductory chapter outlines the history of writing implements themselves, followed by an overview of the styles of penmanship that were taught in the early days of this country. Then he establishes guidelines for reading old documents, and on using context to puzzle out problem words, and also notes the limitations of reading them on microfilm. He describes the challenges of spelling variation, antique abbreviation and contraction, and idiosyncratic spelling and punctuation. Other chapters consider in detail the legal terminology one is likely to encounter, the forms that Arabic and Roman numerals are apt to take, and the effects of the 18th century calendar change. Four sample alphabets (with many variations in each) are reproduced from historical sources. And this first section of the book is capped by an extremely thorough 28-page bibliography covering paleography itself and also the problems encountered in reading handwriting of many times and places. The latter two-thirds of the book consists of a wealth of reproduced documents of every type and from every part of colonial America, accompanied by a transcript on the facing page, for easy comparison. Here one will find Massachusetts baptisms, Richard Henry Lee's Virginia Resolves, wills from colonial New York, personal correspondence from the 17th century Winthrop family, and public petitions subscribed with arrays of widely differing signatures. I have only two minor quibbles: The lack of an index and the inclusion of a chapter on genealogical resources on the Internet (which, unlike the rest of the book, is very general, and is likely to go out of date rather quickly). This is otherwise an extremely well-informed work and should be considered for any researcher's reference shelf.ts of every type and from every part of colonial America, accompanied by a transcript on the facing page, for easy comparison.

The military uniforms, hats, parlor furniture, automobiles, urban scenes, and especially the faces and their expressions, are like a kind of time travel, allowing you to peer back into someone's past. Taylor's previous book, _Uncovering Your Ancestry Through Family Photographs,_ investigated that process. But how to protect the photos you already have tucked away in albums have so future family members will get the same pleasure (and information) from them? And how to rehabilitate those you discover to whom the years and the elements have not been kind? This time, the author outlines the steps you can take to see that your photographs have the best chance of survival and describes the methods conservators and restoration experts follow when the task becomes too much for you. She also guides you through the process of creating a meaningful scrapbook of archival quality, discusses the use of computer enhancement and electronic archives, and points out the legal aspects of posting photographs on a web site. Most of the chapters end with checklists and answers to frequently-asked questions, and there are many sidebars and brief marginal comments regarding further reading and useful Internet resources on the subject. Keeping in mind that the technical aspects of photographic restoration and preservation continue to evolve rapidly, this is an excellent beginner's guide and reference handbook.	2002-07-23

Some are excellent but many are simply a rehash of the most basic (and low-tech) genealogical techniques, or are concerned more with how to turn your computer on and get your modem to work, or are simply compilations of web site addresses (which are better found on the World Wide Web itself). This one falls somewhere in the middle. The author is a well-known columnist and author of the _Complete Idiot's Guide to Online Genealogy,_ and she obviously knows her subject, but she often strays off-topic and introduces unnecessary padding -- as with seven full pages on traditional abstracting methods for land titles, including a discussion of the rectangular survey system and how many square rods to an acre, though she also includes a plug for AniMap. On the other hand, she provides excellent commentaries on the limitations of Internet library catalogs and other tools and the cut-and-paste ease with which bad research can be spread via the Web. She's also adamant that doing real family research still requires one to leave the computer and venture into the courthouse and the library stacks (though the computer can make your foray more efficient), and she doesn't hesitate to suggest that one doesn't really *need* software to do genealogy (though she would hate to have to return to paper-only notetaking).	2002-07-23

Heaps and piles of unrelated notes and photocopies just won't do. One needs a &quot;system.&quot; The author's extremely detailed system for carrying out research and organizing the results includes most of the steps recommended by other writers: Plan your project (so you'll know what you're looking for), extract information exactly as given (even if you think or know it's wrong), and don't mix sources (or you won't know who said what). His description of the use of a detailed research log is especially good, as is his reasoning in regard to accuracy and consistency. When it comes to organizing, identifying, and indexing the source material extracted, however, he goes off in a somewhat different direction . . . and it may help to know that Chamberlin is a mathematician specializing in electronics and computer science. Thus, his discussion of a logical method of numbering the extended lines in a pedigree chart leads to a discursion on the meaning of the radix in positional notation and the utility of the hexidecimal system -- yet, he criticizes the almost universally used Ahnentafel numbering system because it's too complicated! Chamberlin has a penchant for pseudo-technical jargon -- Genealogical Coordinate System, Family Group Records (as opposed to family group sheets), Source Extraction Numbers, Era Correlation Keys, Life Numbers, Event Modifiers, and so on -- although most refer to concepts that already are part of a conventional terminology of long standing among genealogists. (Chamberlin seems also to have trademarked many of his new terms, and he apparently has a genealogical computer program in development.) Moreover, he clearly loves acronyms,so that the reader must wade unnecessarily through FGRs, LNs, and ECKs in developing the GCS.

Many, however, are not aware that Lackey was inspired by an article published more than two decades ago by Elizabeth Mills -- another name that all genealogists should be familiar with. Ms. Mills, one of our field's most popular and influential conference speakers, and for the past fourteen years the very capable editor of the _National Genealogical Society Quarterly,_ has steadily promoted the cause not only of improved genealogical writing but of the rigorous and systematic analysis of material that must precede good writing. This relatively brief and very accessible volume distills and codifies her advice in three main areas: the principles behind source citation, the formats in which citation should be cast, and the fundamentals of evidentiary analysis itself. &quot;Effective citation is an art,&quot; she says, but it's an art that anyone may learn who makes the effort to understand the motivation for careful citation and the factors underlying the carefully thought-out formats she recommends. And whatever the source of information -- courthouse land records, family Bibles, cemetery markers, microfilmed census registers, unpublished manuscripts, electronic e-mail, or a videotaped family reunion -- you will find multiple examples of each in this book. Even more important, to my mind, are her thirteen concisely explained points of genealogical analysis, from the distinction between direct and indirect evidence and between quality and quantity, to the importance of custodial history and her reminder that &quot;the case is never closed on a genealogical conclusion.&quot; For all these reasons, this book is a must-have for every genealogist (and historian, librarian, and archivist).	2002-07-23

Beginning with the background to research -- what &quot;research&quot; actually means, specialized terminology, basic principles, library fundamentals, and all the rest -- Greenwood teaches you, with great clarity and many examples, how to identify what information you need, how to go about locating it, and how to organize it once you've found it. The second, much larger part of the book, leads the reader through the use, analysis, and interpretation of all the major sorts of documents and records out there: Compiled sources (including a discussion of the nature of compilations), vital records, census returns, wills and probate records (and how to become comfortable with legal terminology), local and federal land records, civil and criminal court records, church records, records relating to immigration, military records, and cemetery and burial records. He discusses the nature of abstracting, clears up common misconceptions about court records, points out the limitations of the census, and presents a largely rewritten discussion of the standards of evidence. When the 2nd edition came out a decade ago, the author thought his book would probably never need another major revision, just minor updates. But that was before the personal computer and Internet revolutions forced him to rethink his position, and this edition includes an entirely new and rather lengthy chapter on the appropriate use of the computer in genealogical research and also on its built-in limitations. He also took the opportunity to add a chapter on the legal issues relating to women's property rights, and (of course) made all those minor corrections and updates he had expected. Bluntly, if you can afford only one how-to book for your home genealogy shelf, get this one.	2002-07-23

Later, when she found herself publishing several newsletters, her collection of tips saw use as \\"fillers,\\" and her readers began asking persmission to repeat them elsewhere. Then came the Internet and a whole flood of new tips posted by researchers. Even though she now has a web site filled with tips (take a look at &lt;homepages.rootsweb.com/~hornbeck>), not everyone has ready access to the Net, so a book seemed in order. Everything is grouped into more than forty categories, from copyright, death records, and holidays to microfilm, myths, and the military. Coverage is not meant to be uniform, however; because of her personal research interests, there are sections on German, Russian, and Polish research, but no other European (or non-European) ethnic groups. She does include a great many specialized web sites, including collections of ship's passenger lists, calendar conversion sites, online regimental listings, cemetery listings, lists of plagues and epidemics, and so on. This is strictly a browser's book, though, since there's no index -- which, admittedly, would probably have doubled the size of the book.	2002-07-23

He notes that publishing anything on medieval genealogy is perilous because errors are unavoidable, even among the experts. Nor is he obsessed with discovering royal or peerage descents, especially since many of the best surviving records on those lines exist because their subjects were tried for treason, exiled for rebellion against the Crown, or remembered for other unsavory acts. Coverage is straightforward: More than 160 ancestors before 1300, nearly all of them in Great Britain, who number colonial Americans with known royal ancestry among their descendants. These descents are developed in all possible lines, but only for a handful of generations in most cases. Source citations are extensive, as is the bibliography, and there are separate indexes for personal names and place-names. Finally, the author comments that &quot;this volume is going to press not because it is finished, but because it has reached the point where it needs to generate feedback from the genealogical community&quot; -- an excellent attitude.	2002-07-23

The Virginia ancestry of the Queen Mother is relatively well known, as are the New England cousins of the late Princess of Wales and the Duchess of York -- but did you know Elvis Presley, Jimmy Carter, and Jesse Helms are all collaterally related? Roberts is probably the leading expert at this sort of thing, especially when it comes to uncovering surprising connections, like the British royal descent of Karl Marx's wife (whose grandmother was Scottish), and he carefully lays out examples of what might be called &quot;genealogical evolution,&quot; demonstating that genealogy really is inclusive, not exclusive. Many British, European, and American contemporaries are much more closely related than we often realize. There are also a number of descents contributed by guest columnists which maintain the same high standard of documentation.	2002-07-23

Dronet outlines the town's story in good local history fashion, giving biographical information on many of the early merchants, planters, politicians, and other community leaders, describing local politics, education, and wartime activities, and including scores of photos of school teachers, bank tellers, musicians, mayors, barbers, Legionnaires, postmasters, and fishermen.

Originally planned as a continuation of Charles Patton Dimitry?s _Louisiana Families_ series (published in 1892), the authors augmented that work by extending the coverage to English, Scots, and Irish family lines, as well as adding French and Spanish families omitted by Dimitry. There's a great deal of compiled material here, but no source citations. It would also have been useful to include an every-name index in place of the original index which lists only &quot;stem&quot; surnames. Likewise, the prose can be a bit florid for modern tastes, but Louisiana researchers will want to begin much of their research on new families with this volume.	2002-07-23

The Baldwins, inveterate museum-eers, personally visited most of the more than 170 Louisiana museums, large and small, from the Cabildo and Presbytere in New Orleans (where you can see the Emperor Napoleon?s death mask) to the Huddie \\"Leadbelly\\" Ledbetter exhibit at Mooringsport, his home town. They also accompany most of the listings (which are alphabetical by city) with historical sketches and and other local information. The Germantown Colony and Museum in Minden honors the Harmonist/Utopian settlers of 1835 and the book's entry includes a brief history of the colony and its principals, while the description of the Gary J. Hebert Memorial Lockhouse in Plaquemine includes considerable information about the lock system and the interactive exhibits presented there. Also included is complete information on exact locations, hours of operation, costs of admission, and often the name of the curator or director. This is a first-rate guide which will find a place in the glove compartment of many weekend genealogists.	2002-07-23

In this connection, you're fortunate if you have some English ancestry, for many less common surnames are still largely peculiar to one English county or another. The author's own surname places his origins in the West Riding of Yorkshire; he notes that he is quite used to seeing such names as &quot;Staniforth&quot; and &quot;Broomhead,&quot; but that &quot;southern&quot; names such as &quot;Gulliver&quot; or &quot;Loder&quot; still catch his eye as being non-local -- which must seem very strange to most Americans. Hey, a professor of local history, leads the reader carefully through the historical immigration process -- Anglo-Saxon, Danish, Norman, Dutch, Flemish, Huguenot -- that affected the development of English surnames, outlines the methods available to determine the most likely place of origin of a family name not only in the 17th century (and earlier) but also in the modern mobile world. He traces many names as examples (they have their own index), and alerts the researcher to avoidable pitfalls; &quot;Custer&quot; is a common name in Berkshire, but the General's surname actually was anglicized from the Dutch name &quot;Koster.&quot; Hey provides only the beginning of surname research, as his bibliography makes clear, but this engrossing volume is a good place to start.	2002-07-23

Carmack, who is also a Certified Genealogist, has written two volumes in the \\"Discovering Your . . . Ancestors\\" series (on women and immigrants) and the very practical _Organizing Your Family Research,_ as well as a number of compiled genealogies, all of which have been well received. This new book maintains her high standard. Non-genealogists generally look askance at anyone who likes to hang around graveyards, but since that?s where the majority of our ancestors are to be found, we family researchers approach the subject differently. Carmack has had a particular interest in cemetery research for years (and has published other works on the subject), and she leads the reader expertly through the many research steps necessary for success. First, there are the records created when someone dies -- not just the death certificate and obituary, but coroner?s reports, prayer cards, funeral home records, and census mortality schedules. Then you have to figure out where the interment took place, which means understanding the records cemeteries themselves create, whether municipal, commercial, or church-connected. Once you know where to look, you have to know what to look *for* -- not just the grave marker itself but (as in all genealogical research) the context in which it exists. And that?s only the first quarter of the book! There?s a great deal more to learn regarding tombstone rubbings and photography, ethnic and regional burial customs, cemetery preservation (a growing problem in the U.S., unfortunately), and how to organize and carry out a cemetery recording project. Cemeteries used to be gathering places for the whole family, so the final chapter even makes suggestions on how to picnic respectfully in a cemetery. One appendix provide clues on the meaning of symbolic gravestone art and initials, while another gives a timeline of significant epidemics, disasters, and other causes of multiple deaths in America, and a third explains causes of death which you?re likely to find listed on death certificates. There are also forms for use in cemetery surveys and an eight-page bibliography. This is easily the most comprehensive guide I have seen on the subject.pendix provide clues on the meaning of symbolic gravestone art and initials, while another gives a timeline of significant epidemics, disasters, and other causes of multiple deaths in America, and a third explains causes of death which you?re likely to find listed on death certificates.

And, since heavy inbreeding usually causes aristocrats to have fewer individual ancestors than we commoners, perhaps the author had even more theoretical kin than that. From this preliminary hook, she leads the reader to consider the nature of family ties, the doubling effect, pedigree collapse, &quot;sibling exchange&quot; marriage, the side effects of inbreding and outbreeding, the nature of race, why so many great artists and musicians died without progeny, the practical limits to pushing your lineage into the past, interpreting the accuracy of family stories, family research in the Electronic Age, and -- squeezed into the final chapter -- a research check-list. And scattered throughout are scores of fascinating quotations and tidbits about the subject at hand, from such experts as Milton Rubincam and Eugene Stratton to Mark Twain and Kirk Douglas. This is not a methodological treatise or a how-to manual but a well-written presentation of the sort of information we probably all know but should periodically think about again.	2002-07-23

Then I read the &quot;Introduction&quot; and found that the author had chosen the 500 or so families he includes because &quot;there was some reason to believe their home parish (or at least their home county) had been identified,&quot; at least tentatively, because these families had descendants in the New World, and because most had arrived before 1800. Fair enough. Although this means that the reader won't find any new breakthrough information here, it's nevertheless useful to have previously published data all in one place. In fact -- in addition to Weis's _Ancestral Roots_ and other commonly available titles, the seventeen-page bibliography includes many sources most researchers probably will never have the opportunity to see, such as _Alumni Cantabrigensis_ [graduates of Cambridge University], _The Cockersand Chartulary,_ Berry?s _Pedigrees of the Families in the County of Kent_ (published in 1830), the publications of the various British Parish Register Societies, the entire series of Victoria Histories of the Counties of England, and a large number of 19th century family histories. Entries are alphabetical by family name and each lays out a number of generations, summarizing all the key data known about each. Textual citations to the bibliography are very detailed, allowing the reader to go to the author's sources and make personal judgments of their trustworthiness. Blazons of heraldic arms are included where available, and a glossary explains the terminology. There's also a seven-page &quot;Bibliography of Royal Descents,&quot; revised since its original publication in the _Maryland Genealogical Society Bulletin._	2002-07-23

In 1852, she married James McHatton and lived at Arlington Plantation until Union gunboats arrived at their levee in 1862. They spent the rest of the War convoying cotton from Louisiana across Texas to the markets in Mexico. McHatton took his wife to Cuba in 1865, where they operated a large sugar plantation until his death, when Eliza returned to the States and married Dwight Ripley. The remainder of her life, she says succinctly, \\"was passed in the North.\\" In 1887, she began publishing a series of reminiscences of her adventurous life which were first collected in book form shortly after her death in 1912. The chapters in this volume begin with Eliza's experiences as a boarding school girl in 1840s and stroll reflectively through social events and weddings, the music and songs of the mid-century, the celebrities her father (a judge) entertained, the astonishment of visiting Northerners on first encountering plantation hospitality, and what it was like being raised by a black \\"mammy.\\" The author's style is relaxed and friendly, and you'll think you were being entertained in her parlor. The narrative is accompanied by some two dozen illustrations, many of them pen-and-ink sketches of high quality.	2002-07-23

If you're serious about the research you do on your family's history -- if you're not satisfied with merely collecting names, if you expect to see proof for statements made by other researchers, if you want those who come after you to be able to pick up where you've left off -- then this review can be boiled down a simple statement: Read this book. Buy it, consult it regularly, learn its principles. Since 1964, the BCG has developed and promulgated reliable methods for genealogical research, standards for proof, and a code of ethics for genealogists. This Manual is designed to clarify, codify, and present these standards in an easily accessible form. The first section presents standards for genealogical proof, data collection, and evaluation of evidence, the second lays out standards for genealogical instructors, lecturers, and authors, and the third discusses continuing genealogical education. These are followed by seven lengthy appendices that give examples of lineage compilations and the proof summaries that should accompany them, the most widely accepted formats for lineage publication, and researcher client reports -- which are a very useful tool even if you're only doing research for yourself. There certainly are thousands of books out there begging genealogists to buy them, but the &quot;essential&quot; bookshelf for American researchers is really rather small: _The Source,_ Greenwood's _Researcher's Guide to American Genealogy,_ Everton's _Handybook,_ perhaps _Guide to Genealogical Research in the National Archives,_ and a few others. The _Manual_ should be on that shelf.	2002-07-23

Guide to Discovering Your Ancestors Series)	Books	3	36	36	N	N	Far from this author's best work	Despite the fact that half of everyone's ancestors are women, they traditionally have received short shrift from genealogists. Married women frequently appear on family group sheets as &quot;Elizabeth Blank,&quot; teenage daughters are lost track of between censuses if their new husbands' names are unknown, and even the most dedicated family man was apt to leave everything in his will simply to &quot;my wife.&quot; (Those of Acadian or Quaker descent are fortunate that religious records usually provide a wife?s maiden name.) Carmack is a well-known author and lecturer and one opens this book with high hopes that she will describe new techniques that will enable one to knock down some of those brick walls. Unfortunately, even the moderately experienced researcher is likely to be disappointed. While the first four chapters are filled with good advice on valuable resources, nearly all of them are equally applicable to researching both men and women: passenger lists, city directories, probate records, interviewing aging relatives, etc. Chapter Five is devoted to writing about women in a family history, and Chapter Six is a brief case study of one of the author's own female ancestors -- but again, the methods described would work just as well for a great-great-grandfather as for his wife. (What does one do to identify a wife who dies before the 1850 census, leaving a dirt-farmer husband unable to read or write, who remarries and leaves his worldly goods to his second wife? I have more than one like that!) Carmack is a specialist in social and ethnic history, which can be very useful in fleshing out one's family research -- but in that case, the title is a bit misleading. She provides full citations for all of her many examples, of course, as well as a 24-page *selected* bibliography -- which may be the most useful part of the book.	2002-07-23

I enjoy being able to stand on a street corner, or on the observation deck of a tall building, with such a book in hand and &quot;see&quot; into the past. All cities are formed by their geography and this is perhaps truer for New Orleans than most. Campanella, an environmental analyst and historical geographer, and the author of _New Orleans Then and Now,_ begins with the problematic founding of the city (the malarial swampland between the river and the lake wasn't anyone's first choice). As the city expanded, land reclamation became necessary, but this was complicated by the high water table and the need for a complex drainage system. Its geography also formed the city's culture, its districts, neighborhoods, nodes, street patterns, and shifting industrial center. But many readers may be less interested in the civil engineering case studies and more attentive to this coffee-table volume's glossy photographs, many of them aerial. And most residents of the Crescent City will agree with his description of St. Charles Avenue as the city's &quot;spinal cord&quot; and perhaps be surprised to learn that many of the radiating streets of their city are the exact descendants of footpaths traced on early maps.	2002-07-23

Beginning with a basic pedigree chart and the question \\"What do you know?\\" he leads the reader through a seven-step process of finding out the essentials of what you *don't* know, including family interviews, writing for death certificates and following up the leads they contain, burrowing into the federal census and the Family History Library, and then moving on to state and county records. At that point, the beginner should be well under weigh, with a lengthy list of research goals to pursue. The second part of the book introduces the wider arena of the National Archives, Social Security records, renting microfilms, and dealing with professional researchers. A state-by-state selected and annotated listing of \\"resource centers\\" provides a good basic checklist, as does a list of recommended reference books. A handful of blank master forms (on the Dollarhide model, naturally) are intended for photocopying. Surprisingly, though, except for a few Website addresses, the author takes no notice at all of \\"computer genealogy\\" or the Internet, though the Net is the first point of contact for many would-be genealogists these days. Still, this would be a good textbook for a Beginning Genealogy class.	2002-07-23

In the summer of 1934, many residents of New Orleans had reason to think otherwise. The senator and T. Semmes Walmsley, mayor of the city, had once been uneasy allies, but began feuding on many fronts. In January 1934, after Walmsley defeated the Long candidate, the senator denounced what he claimed was election fraud by the Democratic \\"Old Regulars.\\" Then, never one to bother with courts and the law, he clinched his argument by bringing in the Louisiana National Guard (functioning as the senator's private army) to take over the Soule Building, which housed the voter registration office. The guardsmen quickly set up machine guns at the windows, aimed at the mayor's office across the street. Both sides finally agreed to a monitoring process for the September election, which was swept by the Long slate. The Old Regulars deserted the mayor the following summer and flocked to the senator's banner, thereby setting him up nicely for a run at the presidency in 1936. Long's march on Washington, however, was interrupted by an assassin's bullet in September 1935 (fortunately for all of us, probably). This is an exciting, well-documented, and very well-written account of one of the more unnerving episodes in this state's history.	2002-07-23

Meyerink is an Accredited Genealogist and teacher of wide experience as well as a reference librarian and bibliographer at the Family History Library in Salt Lake City. As in _The Source,_ each of the 20 chapters is written by a recognized expert in a subject (the editor provides six chapters himself), ranging from published catalogs and indexes to printed land records, county histories, and family histories. The Introduction and the four chapters that make up the &quot;Background Information&quot; section should be read by all genealogists, preferably early in their development. Coverage in all chapters ranges from the very general (and essential) to the surprisingly detailed, such as a two-page table of the most useful published and unpublished statewide indexes to county and local histories. Practical examples abound, including the causes of incorrect record transcriptions in published collections, the shortcomings of census indexes (and how to work around them), the differences among the major genealogical journals, where to find key documentary collections, and scores of others. Subject bibliographies, lists of addresses (and Web sites), and assorted checklists are scattered thickly throughout.

Probably, the discovery that more than a few African Americans served on the Confederate side in the Civil War -- and not just as servants, either -- will strike some readers as contradictory, or even unnatural. Certainly, most historians have ignored the subject. But history is history: One must deal with past reality, not subordinate the facts to modern political positions. In researching the subject, Barrow called on the readership of _Confederate Veteran,_ the official publication of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, to submit information on black Southern loyalists. The results were large and diverse, based on official reports, pension applications, family correspondence, newspaper articles, and published memoirs, and from that came this anthology of historical documents and accounts, originally published under the title _Forgotten Confederates._ In fact, the most conservative estimate is that some 50,000 African Americans served on the Confederate side, compared to 600,000 to 1,000,000 white Confederates (depending on who did the counting). Few of them were &quot;properly enlisted,&quot; of course (the Confederate Congress did not authorize such enlistments until the War was in its last days), but those who worked as servants, bodyguards, nurses, cooks, scouts, barbers, teamsters, musicians, and construction workers frequently joined the fight, whether sanctioned or not. The irony, of course, is that black Confederates served within white units, while black Union troops were carefully segregated from white troops. At least twenty-five percent of the Confederate Ordnance Department was black, and several black militia units were raised in Louisiana and Alabama. There were black Confederate sharpshooters in the Seven Days campaign in 1862, and more than 1,000 black sailors served in the Confederate Navy. And a surprising number of black faces appear in photographs of post-War Confederate reunions, many of which are reproduced in this volume. This is an engrossing collection of material and the twenty-one-page bibliography of sources for further study will be most useful to local historians.g collection of material and the twenty-one-page bibliography of sources for further study will be most useful to local historians.	2002-07-23

But an extended family, especially when it's spread out geographically, can mean a lot of individualized correspondence. Often, the solution (at least partially) is a family newsletter. It can be simply a lengthy typed letter, photocopied and mailed in bulk -- but wouldn't you like to turn it into a real &quot;publication,&quot; complete with pictures? And these days, if you own a computer and printer of recent vintage, you can find yourself in the newsletter business before you know it. Floyd, who has published half a dozen books on newsletters and desktop publishing generally, turns her attention here to a variety of ways in which family newsletters can be produced with a minimum of layout, font, and graphics skills. What to write about, keeping it interesting, involving *all* your family, &quot;clustering&quot; your news stories, tailoring your writing style, and avoiding possible trouble spots -- it's all here. And so are tips specifically for the genealogist. There's also an enthusiastic chapter about producing e-mail newsletters, designing family Web sites, and the value of &quot;cross-publishing.&quot; This very visual volume will appeal to many family historians.	2002-07-23

It's a truism that, even among genealogists, few of us are truly interested in the details of other people's family histories. But now and then, a story comes along that is not only instructive in research methodology and interpretation of evidence, but is also an absorbing tale in its own right. And anyone who has heard Dr. Colletta lecture at a conference or speak at a banquet knows he's a born storyteller, a natural entertainer. Though he's based in Washington, the author is often identified with his hometown of Buffalo, New York, and with the subject of immigration research, but he also has Southern connections. When he first became interested in his family's history at the age of fourteen, he interviewed his grandmother and heard from her a sketchy and rather garbled account of the violent death of her own grandfather, Joseph Ring, in the fiery destruction of his store in Rolling Fork, Issaquena County, Mississippi, in 1873. (Though even most of those few facts were not known to her.) And when Joe's widow was returning to her family in the North, she was beset by another tragedy: The death of her infant son in a steamboat wreck. That was the beginning of a thirty-year quest to uncover the facts, a process Colletta describes here, step by step. Was Joe Ring killed by marauding ex-slaves? By local planters who opposed the arrival of recent immigrants? Was it bandits? Disgruntled customers? Or was it an Act of God? Reading newspaper accounts and the scant courthouse documents, tracking recollections of events in other branches of his family, walking the site of the store itself, he considered many hypotheses, eventually discarding all but one. (I won't tell you which one!) But while it sometimes reads almost like a novel, this volume is also an extended research report and every attributed personality trait or speculation on motive is accompanied by a footnote. And his conclusions are carefully bolstered by the available evidence. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.ly enough.	2002-07-23

For many, that's where they were first bitten by the bug, and for others, organizing a reunion is an offshoot of years of identifying previously unknown cousins. Wagner, founder and editor of REUNIONS magazine, does a very good job here of posing and answering all the questions facing anyone who contemplates planning a reunion. Why have a reunion? One family meets annually at the state monument that commemorates an 1838 Indian massacre, where one of its pioneer branches was wiped out. Another pools its resources to bring distant relatives from Ireland. A family reunion can -- perhaps -- heal breaches, end feuds, solve childhood mysteries, and provide context for kids growing up away from the extended family. The descendants of Revolutionary War General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne meet to celebrate their ancestor's colorful history. How do you decide who's &quot;family&quot;? How do you locate them? When do you meet, and where? Who's in charge? And who's going to manage the expenses? How do you keep all the small children occupied? Should you put out a newsletter between reunions? You'll find here considerable collected wisdom offered by experienced reunion organizers, ranging from visiting sites that were of importance to your forebears or hiring a bus to follow an ancestor's pioneer trek, to gathering relics and documents for a local museum or publishing a volume of the family's history. The venue might be a campground or a Caribbean cruise. The food can range from a hot dog picnic or chili cookout to a memorial spread of ethnic or frontier cooking. If you're even beginning to think about a family reunion, you should read this book -- and take notes.	2002-07-23

This is especially true when genealogy is simply one in a long line of topics: There are now &quot;Unofficial Guides&quot; to wine, children, stock picking, job interviews, and menopause. However, each volume in this series is prepared with the assistance of a panel of experts -- in this case Matthew Helm (publisher of the JOURNAL OF ONLINE GENEALOGY), John Scroggins (who received the FGS Award of Merit for his efforts in increasing public access to government files of interest to family researchers), and Tim Stowell (active in the USGenWeb project). Actually, the advice and information you'll receive here is pretty good, including setting up a computer workspace, the difference between primary and secondary sources, setting your research goals, managing your information as you find it, how to find genealogy web sites (method as well as a list of addresses), strategic tips for online research, the proper use of search engines and online library catalogs, creating personal genealogy web pages, and publishing a book as well as publishing to the web. The style is not unlike the popular &quot;Dummies' Guides,&quot; with tips, time-savers, caveats, and informative sidebars scattered throughout.	2002-07-23

As always, Le Carre's development of his characters is masterful and his dialogue and descriptive passages make it clear why, at his best, he is considered an exceptional stylist. The pace of the action in the early part of the book is purposely rather slow, drawing you in, making you pay attention to what's happening and thinking about what secrets might be behind it all -- just as one imagines George is doing. But as the story develops, the pace picks up, until the last quarter is nearly a headlong gallop toward a triumphant final chapter. Unreservedly recommended.	2002-07-23

Kitchel, who has edited and published some two hundred books, makes no attempt to address the content of your book -- no research methods, standards of evidence, or styles of composition -- but concentrates instead on how to plan the project, organize the results of your work, and get it into print and into the hands of the readers, using up-to-date technology and techniques. Planning and scheduling is essential, from the research phase through manuscript preparation, printing and binding, marketing, and distribution, all of which overlap on the progress chart you should learn to keep. Having some experience in editing and publishing myself, I can?t see a topic of any significance he has omitted. It?s all here: ISBN numbers (yes, you want one), physical layout and design (make things as easy for the reader as you can), picking fonts (KISS!), getting the data out of your computer and into a narrative report (I disagree personally with his software preferences, but he isn't wrong), copyediting and proofreading (absolutely), picking a publisher or not using one (and why producing your own research is not &quot;vanity publishing&quot;), printing and reproduction costs (and why it makes no sense to settle for less than the professional standard), dealing with the U.S. Postal Service (form a relationship with your local clerks), identifying your market and playing to it (this is no time to be bashful), and -- perhaps the most important aspect of a publishing project -- planning and controlling your finances. Several appendices address such issues as including photographs (much easier and cheaper than even a few years ago), choosing a lineage numbering system, deciding on an affordable printing process and selecting paper and cover stock (technical, but he makes it easy), finding a bindery (most cities have several job printers), and sample sales letters and advertisements.

I'm a longtime Le Carr&eacute; fan, but I realized recently that it had been nearly two decades since I read what is undoubtedly his best work -- the Smiley trilogy.

This is the second volume in the Smiley trilogy, and it's rather darker than the first. The Hon. Gerald Westerby, journalist and overseas correspondent (\\"hack for a comic,\\" as he calls himself) was a very minor character in the first book, but this one is very much his story, set in Vientiane and Bangkok and London, but mostly in Hong Kong. George Smiley, having rid the Circus of its mole, is determined to make the Service great again, and he proposes to do it by identifying whatever Bill Haydon had tried hardest to conceal. Drake Ko, Chinese tycoon, becomes the focus of George's efforts, and Jerry Westerby is resurrected and sent out East as the key field agent in the operation. The plot is a masterpiece of Le-Carr&eacute;an complexity. The characters are clearly drawn and their motivations are carefully worked out. And the suspense of the final couple of chapters will keep you up late to finish it -- even though the ending is rather sad. I'm going straight on to the third volume.	2002-07-14

The problem is, you have to maintain a significant stock of ingredients you?re unlikely to use otherwise (or I am, anyway), like capers, pine nuts, prosciutto, heavy cream, and Gorgonzola.

It was noted by many contemporary observers, in fact, that in 1801 virtually every hereditary monarch was demonstrably insane. The Bourbons, Hanoverians, Habsburgs, Braganzas, Romanovs, Wittenbergs, Wittelsbachs, and Hohenzollerns all were monstrously inbred, the result of negative eugenics as a matter of state policy. Extreme ugliness, dwarfishness, and physical deformities which were rare in the general public were common enough in the palaces of Europe. And even a relatively healthy newcomer like Napoleon III Bonaparte took full advantage of the royal prerogative to frolic among his horde of mistresses unhindered. Moreover, the full public schedule of even a young royal generally meant that no prince or princess received much of an education and many were barely able to sign their names. Nor is 20th century Britain immune to these personal and dynastic shortcomings. In 1941, five members of the Bowes-Lyon family, including two of Queen Elizabeth's nieces, were confined to a mental hospital in Surrey on the same day; Buckingham Palace later lied to _Burke's Peerage_ about their existence, ignoring the fact that several of them were still alive in an NHS ward in the mid-1980s. This semi-tabloid volume would have been improved by footnotes and an index. Nevertheless, the genealogist who discovers a link to royalty among his ancestors might think twice before publicizing the fact.	2002-07-05

Coverage is limited, more or less, to post-1960 authors writing in English, mostly &quot;literary,&quot; but also including including writers like John Grisham, Stephen King, and Amy Tan. All their works are listed, the more important ones are discussed in some depth (by more than eighty reviewers), and there's a useful &quot;See also&quot; list at the end of each essay.

It's hard to find views that don't include motorways, television towers, and supermarkets, but this splendid book brims over with gorgeous, glossy color photos of many varieties of the &quot;classic&quot; English village. Even better, the text identifies what you're looking at in considerable detail, gives a capsule history, and explains the differences between traditions and cultures in (say) Somerset, Norfolk, and Yorkshire -- which is important for us Yanks, even those of us who are well read in history.

Hitler, maybe? Actually, physicist Justin Hudnut, who has the machine, considers just that -- but he doesn't speak German. The obvious second choice is to go back to Hollywood in the late `30s and derail Ronald Reagan's political career. Yeah, it raised my eyebrow, too, though I'm certainly in favor of anything that would eliminate the Gipper from our history, and Hudnut makes an excellent case for the expedition. But he can't go himself, so he recruits travel writer Gabriel Prince. Gabriel undertakes the mission, landing in Malibu only a few years off the mark, immediately falls in love with Hudnut's gorgeous cousin, Lorna, and shortly becomes a screenwriter by cribbing the plots of the great movies of the 1950s. And he discovers he rather likes \\"Dutch\\" Reagan. The young actor from Illinois is naive and not very bright, but he's personable and his liberal credentials are solid. (This was before Nancy Davis's conservative family got hold of him.) Then, of course, things go badly wrong and Gabriel has to try to correct his mistakes by returning to his own time, . . . only the machine's accuracy is several years off again, and the situation is only exacerbated. All in all, this isn't a bad story, though it's somewhat overwritten in the early and later chapters. I'm not sure the author's theory of how the time-stream works holds together, either. But the picture of the Warner Brothers studio is good, though, and so is Prince's take on the studio system, and his commentary on the great stars of the day. The subtitle is \\"A Novel with Photographs,\\" but there aren't very many of them -- not _like Time and Again_.	2002-06-10

This is one of the best alternative history novels I've read in quite some time. We've seen the premise before -- what if the Black Death that struck Europe in the 14th century wiped out 99.9% of the population instead of \\"only\\" one-third? -- but it's what Stan does with it that makes this a book to read slowly and then re-read. The first section is about Bold, a common soldier in the Golden Horde, who is one of the first to discover the desolation of the Magyar Plain and the emptiness of the lands to the west of it. He has his own adventures, though, being sold into slavery and ending up working in a restaurant in Hangzhou, and then becoming a groom for the emperor. When Bold meets his unexpected end, we discover one of the principal themes behind the book: What happens in the bardo, the anteroom to the reincarnative process. Then we meet Kokila, a low-caste Indian girl who tends to take matters into her own hands. (Back to the bardo.) Bistami is a young Sufi who meets a friendly tiger, then becomes a confident of the Emperor Akbar, then finds himself in Mecca, and then journeys to al-Andalus (what used to be Spain) where he becomes part of the Moslem resettlement of Europe. This is one of the best sections of the book. A few centuries later, Admiral Kheim leads a Chinese invasion fleet against Japan, but they get blown far to the east and discover the New World. What's more, they make it back home and this opens the way for China to take the exploitative role in America that Spain took in our own history. Later, in Samarqand, a failed alchemist and a Tibetan glassblower kick-start the Age of Science -- and much good it does them in the short run. (Back to the bardo, of course.) The scene shifts briefly to the Onondaga and their League, and to a charismatic samurai who comes among them, but then it's back to China. The book goes on this way, mostly alternating narratives with different sets of characters who are mostly the same people recycled, to see if they can get things right this time around. And there are revolts against the gods when the reincarnated finally have had enough. One of my other favorite sections is about the Kerala of Travancore and the foundation of the Indian League, which is also the beginning of decline for Islamic civilization. The description of the Travancori soldiers dancing in ranks is marvelous. Actually, I didn't find the last quarter of the book so appealing, with its sixty-seven-year \\"Long War,\\" and what comes after, but that's just me.

Ralph Messenger is a professor, a philospher by training, but now head of the Centre for Cognitive Sciences at the University of Gloucester. He has a solid rep in his field, with past positions at Cal Tech and MIT. He's also tall and good-looking, just turned fifty, and is a dedicated womanizer. His Californian wife, Carrie, is aware of his tendency to sleep around when he's off at conferences and such, and she tolerates it -- as long as he doesn't do it in their own backyard. (But there's a lot more to Carrie than this, as any fan of Lodge's knack with characters would expect.) Enter Helen Reed, middleaged London novelist and recent widow, who has come to the University to teach a creative writing course for the spring semester. Her background is intensely literary and she and Ralph disagree about almost everything -- but they manage to form a relationship anyway. Lodge apparently recently discovered the whole field of cognitive research and he uses Ralph's explanations to Helen to summarize what he's learned. Fortunately, he does this in an interesting and often witty way -- lots of nice quotes here -- so the reader might actually come out of this book with a surreptitious education in the subject. But Ralph and Helen and Carrie are the focus, of course, and you'll get to know and like all of them, and understand them, even when you don't entirely approve of some of the things they do.	2002-06-06

Through unprecedented computer power, X-Corp. has developed an extremely lifelike virtual reality system, user access to which ranges from ordinary 2D television to immersion of the consumer and wide control of the story's development, depending on how much the consumer wants to spend. Alex considers himself an artist and he hasn't much use for \\"Real Life,\\" the sappy product he's being paid to develop, but it's hard to give up the money -- though he's already lost his wife, a soap actress on one of his earlier projects. Alex has been working quietly on a much better application of the VR technology: \\"Munn's World,\\" set in the New York of 1850. Where \\"Real Life\\" ignores plot in favor of showing off the technology, \\"Munn's World\\" is gritty and involving . . . and almost too real, for a Nativist killer who stalks the old city, butchering the hated Irish, seems to have edged over into the \\"real\\" New York. Foy is extremely knowledgeable about his city of the present and the past (or else he's really, really good at faking it), and he has a serious gift for characterization, intricate plotting, and descriptive writing generally -- and a teriffic ear for Nooyawkese. He puts you inside the protagonist, especially, and his take on Riker's Island is terrifying and unforgettable. I don't know how I managed to miss hearing about this when it came out, but I'm glad I found it!	2002-05-14

Mitchell, who is well experienced at plotting blood-freezing action plots, does it again in this story of southwestern Indian casinos and Jamaican posses and psychotic killers, but he also does an excellent job of putting you inside the head of the lead characters (including the bad guys), letting you find out why they are who they are, how they relate to each other, and how they deal with being Indians in a mostly white world. And some of it is pretty horrific. But this isn't Tony Hillerman and there's not much romanticism in modern Indian life. An excellent piece of writing.	2002-05-02

Quoting from the opening of Chapter 7: \\"There are many, many types of books in the world, which makes good sense, because there are many, many types of people, and everybody wants to read something different. For instance, people who hate stories in which terrible things happen to small children should put this book down immediately.\\" And they certainly do. The Baudelaire children -- fourteen-year-old Violet, twelve-year-old Klaus, and their infant sister, Sunny -- are off at the beach one day when Mr. Poe the banker comes to tell them that their loving parents have perished tragically in a fire and that their mansion has been utterly destroyed. They will have to go and live with Count Olaf, their (geographically) nearest relative, until Violet is old enough to inherit. He's a horrid, dirty, smelly, scheming, dangerous man, and an actor to boot. Their life there is terrible, even with the kind Justice Strauss and her lovely library next door. And then Count Olaf begins making plans to get his hands on their fortune. The author (whose real name is Daniel Handler) is obviously perverse and possibly deranged, and I love his work; it's hard to tell, sometimes, whether he's really writing for kids or for weird adults. This is the first of a projected thirteen volumes, and all of them are going on my Edward Gorey shelf.	2002-04-25

Emma is a &quot;drummer&quot; in her mid-30s, an agent to retail stores throughout the Midwest of the T. A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company. She's a woman in what was, before the Great War, decidedly a man's world, but she beats most of them at it all hollow. She's claimed to be the first businesswoman in American literature and she serves as a mouthpiece for Ferber's feminist politics and her Progressive attitude toward the commercial world. This was the first of three collections (all made up of stories serialized in magazines) and they were immensely popular in their day -- especially with women, though Theodore Roosevelt was a fan. too. In fact, Emma was Ferber's first real hit and paved the way for her prolific later career. The style, of course, tends somewhat to effusive overwriting, but you get the same in almost any popular literature written at the turn of the century. Good stuff!	2002-04-25

Field is probably the country's current best analyst of screenplays and teacher of the theory and mechanics of screenplay-writing, and I own all his previous books. This one was a bit of a disappointment, though, being heavy on self-conscious, egocentric autobiography and light on analysis of the films he discusses as being &quot;turning points&quot; in his development. (And he uses that phrase way too often.) Though he purports not to believe in luck or coincidence, he does seem to have been in the right place at the right time far more than most of us -- a crawl-on role in _Gone With the Wind_ as an infant, nephew of one of the great cinematographers, student at Berkeley when Jean Renoir was Writer in Residence, buddies at the UCLA film school with the niece of Sam Peckinpah, first job at David Wolper Productions when it was just beginning, and so on. Oddly, in between the fits of ego and overwriting (&quot;this is how I invented/discovered . . .&quot;), there's also a lot of &quot;aw shucks, little ol' me&quot;-ness. For this kind of thing, I think William Goldman's two (so far) volumes of Hollywood autobiography are much better.	2002-04-25

I'm generally a fan of Terry Bisson's work, especially his short stories (&quot;Bears Discover Fire&quot; is great), but this novel-based-on-a-movie-based-on-a-short-story is just embarrassing. The film was a mostly incoherent rendering of William Gibson's very good story (even though Gibson himself wrote the screenplay); I suspect Bill's stuff just doesn't translate well to the screen. This novelization (why bother?) has all the film's confusion and none of Gibson's trademark style and atmosphere. Worse, Bisson throws in some minor bits and pieces of his own invention.

This is a rather frustrating book -- generally well written, filled with interesting ideas, but sometimes inconsistent and sometimes simply unbelievable. Teresa Simmons and her husband are trained FBI field agents in what seems to be our present, except that both were trained with the help of an extremely sophisticated virtual reality system that put them into various roles in a wide range of historically-based \\"killer\\" scenarios. Through repeated insertions into each scenario, they had to learn to react appropriately and to survive the situation. (The process seems extremely wasteful of personnel, not to mention impossibly expensive.) Anyway, her husband is killed in the line of duty in a small Texas town and Teresa, trying to cope with her loss, discovers a similar mass killing took place at the same time on the same day in a small town in the south of England. So, naturally, she goes off to Sussex to look around. (Huh?) Then she begins patronizing the local virtual reality provider and discovers a whole new kind of \\"shareware\\" virtual experience. (If she's so well trained and informed, why had she never heard of this before?) The overlap between the incidents in Texas and England become more pronounced and Teresa's virtual experiences become more complicated, until everything comes to a head in a scenario within a scenario . . . sort of. The problem is, Priest assumes that a woman experiencing a man's role in virtual reality -- including sexual activity -- won't react any differently than she had as her own self. This seems extremely unlikely. And he has a very shaky grasp of what West Texas is like, even though he was previously married to Texan author Lisa Tuttle. And nothing is ever really resolved. It's like he was three-quarters of the way through writing and re-writing the book, and just stopped.	2002-04-22

She seems to subscribe to the \\"where there's smoke, there's fire\\" school of historical causation, citing the fact that there was so many rumors floating about at the time linking Richard III to the deaths of the boys. She seems to be entirely unaware of the Tudor virtuosity at propaganda.

This is another of those books that I read shortly after it first appeared and have re-read every decade or so since. Though Varley had already made a reputation with a number of exceptional short stories, this was his first novel, and in many ways it laid the groundwork for most of his subsequent lengthier work: A future in which \\"The Invaders,\\" an extrasolar species so very alien, humanity has little chance of ever understanding it, has stopped off on Earth to liberate the various cetacean races . . . which it regards as superior to humans and fungi. Ninety-nine percent of the human race died of starvation, leaving only the colonists in the Moon and the outer planets to carry the torch. A couple of centuries have now passed and Luna is carrying on business as usual. Lilo, a genetic engineer-entrepreneur, is in deep trouble for experimenting with human clones and has been sentenced to permanent death, but Boss Tweed, the out-of-office head of the Free Earthers (who dream of reclaiming the home planet), has other plans for her. Before long, there are several cloned versions of Lilo banging around the solar system, interacting with several other multiply-cloned persons, all of them illegal. Meanwhile, the beam-cast of technical information from a star in the constellation Ophiuchus has been interrupted by what seems to be a demand for payment for service. Varley has been called the successor to Heinlein, and he certainly has a knack for creative characterization and for casually spinning off startling and intriguing ideas.	2002-03-12

I've enjoyed everything by Connie Willis that I've ever read . . . so how did I miss ever reading her first novel? I dunno, but I'm glad I noticed. This is a beautifully conceived, quietly lyrical story of love and loyalty. Jeff Johnston is a young Civil War researcher working for an historical novelist, who meets Annie, who has been having Robert E. Lee's dreams (so the general can get some rest), and he becomes her protector and facilitator. And he eventually finds out just how he himself figures in her dreams. The anxiety and tension build so slowly, you won't notice at first, but by the time you're three-quarters through the book, you won't be able to put it down, not for a minute. And the tragic closing line is the most literally stunning I've ever read. Her grasp of the relevant minutiae of the War is flawless, too. There's a reason Connie has won six Hugos and six Nebulas, as well as the Campbell Award for this very book.	2002-03-11

He can write really tough, noir stories, but my favorites have always been his \\"DKA\\" novels, featuring Daniel Kearny, king of the San Francisco repo men, and his crew of talented and slightly strange operatives: Larry Ballard, good-looking white-bread and black belt in assorted martial arts; Bart Heslip, black ex-boxer and Larry's best friend; Giselle Marc, beauty combined with brains and organizational smarts; O'Bannon, elder statesman of repo artists and inveterate lush; Ken Warren, Vietnam veteran with a serious speech impediment; and numerous others who come and go throughout the series. Gores's specialty is to combine this retinue of fascinating people with complex -- but reasonable and logical -- multiple plots, an eye for telling detail and description, and a droll style of delivery that will have you laughing out loud on the bus. This time, the overlapping plots include Bart going undercover in the Tenderloin District, Giselle talking Dan (who's been thrown out of his house by his wife) into taking on a personal security job for a young computer geek who is about to become a semi-billionaire, Ken becoming the sexual target of the geek's aging society mom, Jacques Daniel trying to uncover union corruption and being run off a Marin cliff on his racing bike, Trin Morales trying to balance his repo load with his desire to become both a Latino godfather and the bane of underage chicas, and Larry getting involved with a gorgeous, feisty Italian labor union official who just may be more than he can handle. And then there's the two cops who have been a team so long they're known as Rozenkrantz and Guildenstern, automatically dressing alike and keeping up an endless stream of off-color jokes and patter. The pace is fast and steady, and ten pages from the end of the book, you'll shake your head and wonder how Gores can ever bring all the threads to a conclusion. But he does, and very tidily, too.

She works in a baby photo studio at the mall and sees the world through her own much darker photography. She has an abusive father and a biker boyfriend. Then she quite unintentionally explodes a bomb at LAX, decides it's time to completely change her life, and becomes Nina Zero. Then things get complicated. As you get farther into this book, the story and Nina's personality both get darker, too, just like her photography. She hooks up with a kitsch artist and a paranoid documentary film-maker, goes to work for a grossly overweight detective, and learns how to handle a revolver. Mary Alice was basically a nice girl in fuzzy sweaters, but Nina is definitely dangerous. It's a fast read, only a little over 200 pages, but the protagonist becomes a very real person, deftly drawn and developed, and you'll care about what happens to her.

I've been collecting first editions of her works for years, and she remains, in my considered opinion, the best historical novelist writing in English today. Still, I like best her earlier stuff, most of which is set in various corners of medieval Europe. This one is about the last days of Attila (in AD 453), who formed the diverse Hiung tribes into a nation, and the almost immediate disintegration of his empire without him to hold it together and impress his will upon it. But the story itself focuses on Tacs, a young warrior and something of a ne'er-do-well, though brave in battle and intensely loyal to the Kagan. Then there's Dietric, son of the subject Gepid king, Adaric, who's fascinated by the Huns and becomes friendly with Tacs. There are Tacs's cronies, Monidiak and Yaya and Bryak, also single, who join him in annoying their neighbors, and The Fluteplayer, a great shaman and sort of a surrogate father to Tacs. And there's the Roman monk, Aurelius, who hopes to convert the heathen Hun but ends up understanding them much better than he expected. Holland, as always, puts you right in the midst of the people, showing you how even the strangest of strange cultures makes perfect sense to those immersed in it.	2002-03-11

Now, in order to stay in Japan (with its full national health system, which she really needs), she sells \\"fantasy funerals\\" to wealthy Japanese with unconventional tastes. Alex Thorn is a psychologist from Seattle whose exchange-student son died in Shizuoka under inadequately explained circumstances, and Alex has come in search of answers. That's the set-up, and you know from the beginning these two semi-loners are going to interact, but the author, who was herself an English professor in Shizuoka, makes it all very believable and convincing. And the resolution -- who was behind Gaby's firing and why, what really happened to young Thorn and why, and where Gaby and Alex will go from here -- is satisfying without being trite. More important than the plot, however, is Backer's frequently hilarious dissection (nicely wry rather than ha-ha funny) of modern Japan and its views on and treatment of gajin -- foreigners. Americans and Europeans often fit in rather easily in each other's countries, becoming accepted and losing merely expatriate status. But not in Japan. We also tend to think of Japan as an extremely polite society, but Backer shows just how rude and arrogant the Japanese can be, to strangers and each other, and also how subtle and occasionally cerebral. But especially how different. The mantra throughout is \\"This is Japan. Expect the unexpected.\\" Add in the yakuza, Pocari Sweat, transplant operations, wealthy Zen priests, academic politics, cities without a single street name or house number (just follow the pizza delivery truck), the refusal to believe in single working women who aren't looking for husbands, and remember that \\"very difficult\\" means \\"impossible,\\" and you'll find it impossible to put this one down.

(That's just my own opinion, of course.) But every so often, he produces an exceptional piece of work, and this is one of them. Timescape is another. And in both cases, it's because he's focused on the theme of scientist-at-work. Of course, Benford is a working scientist, so he knows what it's all about, but he also does a terrific job of putting you in there with the characters. In this story, the protagonist is nuclear and particle physicist Alicia Butterworth, female, black, intellectually aggressive, and socially a bit inept. During an interesting and innovative experiment with the collider at Brookhaven, there's a small explosion which wrecks her detector and produces an unexplainable object like a shiny, heavy bowling ball. Alicia and her post-doc, Zak Nguyen, basically highjack the thing back to UC-Irvine for investigation -- which isn't entirely believable, inasmuch as she's gotten this far in a professional career. The notion that Alicia and her buddies would all scamper out to the desert in the last chapter seems a bit thin, too. But anyway: The science is fascinating and (to a non-physicist like me) seems believable. Not only she but Max Jalon, the theorist from Caltech whom she ropes into helping her, are nicely drawn and quite three-dimensional, and so is Zak. When he works at it, Benford is very good at both analyzing the humans and humanizing the analysis.	2002-03-07

This is another book I haven't read in at least twenty years -- but I remembered enjoying it. It's 2059 and Jud Elliott, graduate in Byzantine history and dissatisfied law clerk, joins the Time Service. The Service has two divisions: the Time Couriers, who escort groups of paying tourists into the past, thereby generating the financial support for the research the Service carries out, and the Time Patrol, which enforces the integrity of the time stream by retroactively preventing &quot;timecrime.&quot; (All of this under-structure is predictable to any experienced fan of time travel stories.) Jud does pretty well on the Byzantine run, showing his tourists all the vivid highlights of Constantinople's history, until he begins researching his own ancestry and falls for the lucious Pulcheria Ducas, his great-great-multi-great-grandmother in the late 12th century. Then he panics and duplicates himself, and the paradoxes begin to pile up. Silverberg, a very knowledgeable student of history, fills the narrative with considerable by-the-way Byzantine history and takes the opportunity to poke fun at the mores of the mid-21st century . . . which are clearly modeled on those of the 1960s. The characters of Black Sam and sly old Metaxas are pretty well done, too. This certainly isn't Silver-Bob's best, but it's a lot of fun.	2002-03-05

It's been twenty years since the last appearance (in _Compromising Positions_) of Judith Singer, upper middle-class Long Island housewife and amateur detective. A lot has happened to her in two decades. She's now a widow, her husband having died suddenly of a stroke two years before. She's completed her dissertation and is now a professor of history at a small but well regarded college. Some things haven't changed, especially her love for homicide cop Nelson Sharpe, which she has kept carefully at bay all these years. Now, intrigued by the disappearance and murder of Courtney Logan, ex-investment banker and perfect mom, she finds herself semi-employed by Courtney's father-in-law, retired hoodlum Fancy Phil Lowenstein. Courtney's husband, the determinedly legit Gregory Logan, is the cops' favorite suspect, and Fancy Phil needs help finding evidence to clear him. It's right up Judith's alley -- until the case brings her into abrupt contact with Nelson and the old flame rekindles. Isaacs is always a hoot and a half, with a droll wit, a keen ear for dialogue, and a real talent for characterization. Every member of the large supporting cast is deftly drawn and entirely believable. So is the convoluted plot itself, as Judith works her way logically through the possibilities, borrowing her friends' talents and contacts to overcome obstacles and paying heed to that occasional flash of insight that keeps the investigation going. This is a terrific book.	2002-03-01

This is the first thing I've read by Steele and I was attracted to it by the time-travel theme. He does a pretty good job, but the style is somehow reminiscent of ANALOG of the 1950s and `60s -- which is fair enough, I guess, since the protagonist, NASA bureaucrat/physicist David Z. Murphy, is a lifelong fan of the magazine and now writes science articles for it. He doesn't know it, but his counterpart on another worldline is about to devote his life to the development of a working time machine, all because a research  expedition from three centuries in the future has gone back to visit the zeppelin HINDENBURG just before its fiery demise at Lakehurst. Only it doesn't explode until a half-hour *after* everyone has disembarked. And in their bewildered flight back to their own time, the timeship crew manages to crash-land in 1998 Tennessee. Yes, it's all about as confusing as it sounds, but Steele manages to keep everything straight -- usually. He could have done with improved copyediting, though, especially in his chapter headings, which consist of dates -- and several of which are totally impossible.	2002-02-25

Since being diagnosed with diabetes a while back, and being a dedicated foodie and decent cook, I've been collecting recipes appropriate to my new situation. Happily, there's quite a bit out there, and I had hopes for this nicely illustrated collection since it's published by one of the most popular food magazines around. Instead, I'm appalled at what they consider &quot;light&quot; cooking! &quot;Roasted Vegetable Pitas&quot; at 5 grams of fat and 54 grams of carbohydrates each! &quot;Broccoli-Rice Casserole&quot; at 7 fat and 48 carbs per serving! &quot;Mocha Fudge Pie&quot; at 7 fat and 52 carbs per slice! They also seem to consider &quot;one serving&quot; of pasta as being about three times the usual recommended amount -- 1-1/2 cups instead ½ cup. I don't think they understand what's really needed by those trying to cut back on fat, starch, and sugar, or else their name is meaningless.	2002-02-25

Pinches has acquired quite a reputation as an expert in heraldry, the principal visual codification of the landed classes in Great Britain and Europe. In this volume, he works his way through one specialized segment of the heraldic histories of all the western European nations. (The southeastern countries like Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria are omitted because they were under Turkish domination for so long, they never developed a western heraldic system). He's interested not in the arms granted to families but to the added ornamentation of an achievement: the crest, supporters, helm, assorted crowns and coronets, and the mantling, all of which have traditionally been more important on the Continent than in Britain. He fills out his discussion with an historical overview of the monarchy and nobility of each country, as well as the political histories of the emerging nation-states of Europe as they affected heraldic practice. Many maps and several hundred black-and-white illustrations make this an excellent reference tool in its field.	2002-02-22

Not enough attention has been paid by lineage compilers to the kingdoms of northern Europe, though the Scandinavian countries have some of the most ancient monarchies still in existence - even when the putative descents from Odin are discounted. The early monarchs of Denmark, for instance, appear in 9th century Frankish records, and Rurik, traditional founder of Kiev, was almost certainly Swedish. The counts of Flanders descend from a daughter of Charles the Bald. Flanders, in fact, is the link between the Carolingian dynasty and the ruling houses of Denmark and Sweden. Alen and Dahlquist (who are married) are amateur genealogists, and there's a certain amount of \\"fluff\\" in this volume, but the level of the research and writing is generally quite high and there are numerous lineage charts throughout.	2002-02-22

There are few technologically advanced cultures in the world that seem as &quot;foreign&quot; to Americans as Japan, which may be why a significant number of Yanks have been fascinated by Japan over the years. In 1908, Davidson and her husband went there, as so many North Americans have, as university English teachers on a one-year contract, though she had a life-long interest in everything Japanese. She learns the language far better than most of us could, though she obviously never feels she's learned enough. She adapts to Japanese ways of doing things, of thinking, of looking at the world, and this process also affects how she sees her own country. She's willing to be a _gaijin_ trying to fit in -- not that she has any choice -- but she's also willing to be critical of such things as Japanese racism and xenophobia. She forms close friendships which will last for two decades. Then a tragedy in her husband's family forces their return to Canada, which seems, for awhile, like a foreign country. Her account of their later visit to Paris is hilarious -- especially the way her mind seems to equate &quot;foreign&quot; with Japanese, pushing French phrases out of her mind and leading her to spout colloquial Japanese to French hotel clerks. And, even though on their subsequent visits to Japan, they consider permanent residence, they finally realize they could never become *that* adapted -- but they make up for it by building their new home in the North Carolina hills along distinctively Japanese lines. I like Davidson's calm, thoughtful approach to what constitutes &quot;foreignness.&quot;	2002-02-20

Christopher Dicken, a field investigator working in the Republic of Georgia for the CDC, has stumbled on the mass grave of the victims of a governmental biological coverup. Kaye Lang, a biologist specializing in retroviruses, is discovering that ancient diseases coded into our DNA are being reactivated, but by what? And Mark Augustine, a top medical administrator in the U.S. government, is faced with what may be the most virulent plague of all time. This is science fiction with a capital &quot;SCIENCE,&quot; full of the jargon of evolutionary biology and biochemistry. Such a subject could be confusing, but Bear, as usual, handles it very well. All the characters -- even the minor ones -- are nicely developed and the extremely complex and erudite plot is very well thought out. You'll have to work to follow what's going on, but he even includes a brief biological &quot;primer&quot; and a glossary. This one may be even better than _Blood Music._	2002-02-15

And the inscription at its base indicated that it was a monument raised by a victorious warlord a couple of decades in the future? That's the armature around which Wilson has constructed this story of Scott Warden, skilled mid-level computer tech, and his ex-wife and daughter. There's also his sort-of buddy, Hitch Paley, and Sue Chopra, his sometime employer and perhaps the only person who can get a handle on what the monuments mean. Because they continue to appear over the years, apparently mirroring the conquests of Kuin, all across Asia and the Middle East and then Latin America. Who is Kuin -- or, rather, who will he be? Should the world prepare to try to fight him? Or just regard his ascendancy as inevitable and accommodate him? But there might not be much of a society left by the time of Kuin's arrival. The thing is, this is actually the story of the people involved, what they go through over the course of the pre-Kuin years, how they adapt to economic collapse and the spread of military &amp; governmental secrecy and power born of desperation. It's a very powerful story and it's the first work by Wilson I've read, but it certainly won't be the last.	2002-02-06

One novel, a short period spent on the \\"young writers to watch\\" list, and the only thing he has produced since is a dozen unfinished novels and a series of not-yet-published volumes about other writers. He writes a column for a writer's magazine and teaches a writing class at a local institute, while his wife has become one of London's leading interior decorators, earning far more money than he ever will. His relationship with his teenage son is terrible. Gregory's envy of those who were once, potentially, his peers has been eating his guts out for years. Most of those working writers, in his opinion, are mere authors; only he is a real \\"writer.\\" This is especially true of his opinion of Martin Amis -- whom he always refers to as \\"Martin.\\" (One must wonder about the true relationship between Amis and Blacker, if any. . . .) Then Peter Gibson shows up in his class and Gregory recognizes true talent. He casts himself as Peter's guide to the literary world -- and discovers the young writer has just completed an amazingly mature, groundbreaking novel. A novel that should have been his. Will be his.<br /><br />This book started out witty and ruefully funny; you shake your head while smiling at Gregory's corrosive ego and self-delusion. After awhile, though, he's not so funny. And by the denouement -- which I, for one, did not see coming -- he has become downright scary. This study of the decay of an admittedly intelligent man's self-image is a remarkable piece of work.	2002-02-05

The author is a poet and novelist, but he's also a dedicated improvisational cook. He swears by his black iron skillet, taking the position that anything that can be cooked in a skillet, should be -- spaghetti, bisquits, chicken pot pie, blackberry cobbler -- anything. The essays in this collection are sort of bite-size, most of them revolving around a particular culinary topic. And most of those relate to his Southern upbringing in Mississippi, East Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas -- though he's now in Santa Fe and mutton gets into the act late in the book. Butler's style tends somewhat to the cutesy, but what he has to say about families and meal times and growing up the son of a Baptist preacher is generally worth listening to. And his commentary on the how and why of cooking are always interesting.	2002-02-05

The White Tower was begun by William the Conqueror and the place has served as fortress, royal residence, prison for dozens of the famous, arsenal, treasury, royal mint, military garrison, armory, state archives, and repository of the crown jewels. As Deputy Governor, living with his wife in an apartment with carpeting and paneled walls laid over the ancient stone, Mears is uniquely qualified to write this volume and he does a creditable job. The organization is chronological by royal dynasty and the text, while hardly literary, is quite adequate. But it's the photographs that make the book, identifying and showing you nooks and crannies you might have seen but didn't recognize for what they were. Other more private locations, you won't have seen at all, including the residences of many of the Yeoman Warders. A fascinating volume.	2002-01-29

I'm a sucker for books about \\"historical mysteries,\\" whether it's the Princes in the Tower or pre-Columbian exploration in the New World. Here, Fagan tries to cover all the bases in the pre-medieval world and he's only partially successful. Some topics, like the origin of Stonehenge and the methods used in constructing it, are obvious choices; others, like the identification of the burial in Tomb 55 in the Valley of the Kings, are not (except to Egyptologists). Some seem pretty far afield from \\"ancient.\\" The \\"truth\\" behind King Arthur is solidly medieval, for instance. The biggest problem, though, is the attempt to cram so much into only 300 pages; most of the chapters run four pages or less (and much of that is maps and illustrations), and some cover only a single page. While much of this volume was already pretty familiar (to me), some topics were new ground and quite fascinating, including the probable date for first settlement of Australia (much earlier than I would have thought) and the latest thought about the bog-bodies of Scandinavia and northern Germany. Because the chapters were written by a gaggle of specialists, the style and depth of content are somewhat uneven; some are clear and concise and summarize the latest discoveries and interpretations rather nicely, but some simply shrug their shoulders or waffle. This is especially true of politically sensitive issues, like the question of the \\"blackness\\" of the ancient Egyptians or the eventual fate of the remains of Kennewick Man. (In both cases the authors seem disappointingly afraid to take a stand on the side of science). All in all, it's an interesting afternoon's browse, but, given the high price, you should borrow this one from the library.	2002-01-29

The much-honored Russell spent nearly thirty years as chief art critic for the London Sunday Times, and then came to New York and did the same thing for the New York Times for another sixteen years. Even after leaving London, though, he still considers himself an insider of that city, and in this book he shares his fifty-year perspective with the reader. It's not a guidebook nor a travel book, but a highly idiosyncratic sort-of-memoir of London, organized around many diverse themes, including Samuel Johnson, Buckingham Palace, the rebuilding of the city after the Great Fire, the role of the Thames, and what he calls the &quot;spirit of place&quot; -- which is one of the best chapters in this marvelous book. Throughout, he illustrates his thoughts and recollections and often witty commentary with reproductions of art and photographs of people and buildings which, brought together in one place like this, are just about worth the price of the book by themselves. One of the best books about London I've seen in years.	2002-01-29

This book hooked me on the first page, with its description of just what winter is like in Algonquin Bay, Ontario, in what even Canadians call &quot;the North.&quot; John Cardinal is a police detective with a Past and a string of murders of adolescents to solve. His partner is Lise Delorme, six years in Special Investigations (i.e., political cases and what we in the U.S. would call Internal Affairs), whose assignment is to investigate Cardinal, as well as to help solve the murders. So far, so good. Blunt gets you into Cardinal's mind, into the personality of this frozen little town, into the relationship between the local cops and the RCMP . . . and then he blows it completely. One-third of the way into the story, he tells you who the killer is. A serious error on the part of the author. What began as a potentially first-rate murder mystery degenerates into a mediocre thriller. At the two-thirds mark, I gave it up.	2002-01-15

Several reviews of Eversz's book, _Shooting Elvis,_ compared it unfavorably to Banbury's subsequent effort at noir hipness. I can't say I agree. Jill, a mid-twenties immigrant to LA from Connecticut, works part-time in a used book store, mostly so she can read a lot. And forget -- though you don't get a clue as to what she's trying to forget until far into the book. She buys a signed first edition of Jack London's _The Cruise of the Snark_ cheap from a kleptomaniac dwarf, thinking to make a killing on the resale -- and immediately everyone insists the book was stolen and wants it back. Who the rightful owner is, is the problem, but it soon ceases to matter, as Jill gets sucked into the struggle between several sets of violence-prone contenders. Along the way, Banbury has the chance to do a number on movie industry people (especially directors and B-movie actors), rare book dealers, and Angelinos generally. But, despite the author's sometimes tart way with a phrase, the narration wanders all over the lot. I became impatient with the book and had I accidentally left it in my doctor's waiting room when I was three-quarters of the way through it, I probably wouldn't have bothered to go back for it. In fact, the story and the characters don't really get interesting until the last fifty-odd pages . . . and even then, I had trouble accepting Jill's rather blas&eacute; reaction to her treatment at the hands of Seth and his friend.	2002-01-13

It's a fat thing (480 pages) but it sometimes seems much longer. Not because it's dull -- it's *never* dull -- but because the prose and the plot are so dense. Powers obviously has a thing for the circle of poets that included Byron, Shelley, and Keats. They're all here, along with Mary Godwin Shelley and many of the historical hangers-on, but Powers's interpretation of their lives and actions is, as always, far different from what you what expect. It's the nephelim, the vampires, that made Shelley the bizarre figure that he was, and that made Keats such a bleak person, and that made Byron so waspish. But it's also why they were such fervent poets. Then there's Michael Crawford, ex-ship's surgeon, pioneering gynecologist, and new husband. Crawford doesn't know it when the book opens, but he's about to lose a finger as well as another wife and he's about to spend the next six years almost constantly on the run. Whether he's hauling François Villon about in a little red wagon, or trying to answer the Sphinx's riddle on an Alpen mountaintop, or battling the 800-year-old head of the Habsburgs in Venice, he's about to enter a dispairing, exhausting, and very traumatic period of his life. Fascinating for the reader, too, because Powers puts you right into the period and the company of Byron et al. The frustrating part? The first two-thirds of the story are irritatingly episodic, almost as if they had been written originally as a serial and then stitched together (they weren't), and the characters tend to refer back explicitly to earlier events as if you might have forgotten them (you won't). But make sure you're holed up somewhere that you can lose yourself in the last 150 pages undisturbed, because you won't want to quit without finishing them.	2002-01-06

It's interesting to compare this treatment of the subject with Neal Zimmerman's _At Work at Home,_ which I also read recently. While Zimmerman concentrates on creating &quot;livable&quot; working spaces at home, which are not always elaborate or expensive, either, Sweet seems to have a thing for cold, bare, &quot;industrial&quot; environments with square, hard-looking chairs, exposed rivets, and shiny metal gooseneck lamps.

This small limited-edition volume includes all of them, two in collaboration with his close friend, James Blaylock (who also contributes an Introduction). Not all of them really work for me, but I like &quot;Night Moves,&quot; &quot;The Better Boy,&quot; and &quot;Where They Are Hid&quot; very much indeed.

Like Powers's _Living with Books_ and Ellis's _At Home with Books,_ which I've reviewed in the past, this is the sort of lushly illustrated volume anyone with similar interests will sit and drool over. If you work at home, or if you need a second space at home for the overspill from your office job, you have a number of options: Claim a corner of an existing space in your house or apartment (living room, kitchen, even a niche off a hallway), convert a spare bedroom or even a walk-in closet, move into the attic or the basement (if you live in the part of the country that HAS attics and basements), make a separate dedicated space out of a garage or other outbuilding, or even construct a new space on your property, either attached to your house or semi-isolated in a handy patch of woods. (My own home office, like many others, used to be a kid's bedroom, and I haven't done much to it; it still has the Winnie-the-Pooh ceiling fixture.) The author walks you through all these possibilities and has you think about zoning and property-line setbacks, and floor and ceiling materials, and light sources and plumbing, and active storage and bookshelving. He also points out the need to control your workspace, to separate work from home life, and to identify &quot;swing spaces.&quot; How much space do you really need? Maybe not as much as you think. Consider as a guide the acronym &quot;CAMP,&quot; which stands for Computer station, Administrative station, Meeting station, and Project station. The need may be minimal (I never have clients in my home) and some of the others may be combined (I do admin work at the same work table where I do projects), but looking at it this way will lead you to reconsider your own SoHo. The pictures in this book, naturally, will make you jealous of those with the design talent and the money to establish such luscious work areas. The nicest and most unusual, not surprisingly, belong to architects working at home. Nevertheless, even with my own relatively simple needs, I picked up a number of ideas on how to optimize my own space.ely simple needs, I picked up a number of ideas on how to optimize my own space.	2001-12-21

Historical mysteries seem to be all the rage these days, but this is one of the best I've seen lately. Set in London during the summer of 1815 -- Waterloo summer -- it's the story of Henry Morton, a constable with the king's warrant, working as a semi-independent policeman out of the Magistrate's office at No. 4, Bow Street. I know something about the time and the place, and Banks seems to have made no false steps at all in his depiction of the people of a London which had a very low opinion of professional cops (who worked on commission for each felon hanged). The plot is also very well done, involving several murders, theft of antiquities, and deep corruption among the Runners of Bow Street. The principal characters -- Arabella, the actress with whom Morton has a nonexclusive arrangement, and Lord Arthur Darley, Arabella's other interest, whose open friendliness Morton isn't entirely at ease with, and young Jimmy Presley, who seems likely to make a good Runner himself if he's careful, and Sir Nathaniel Conant, the Chief Magistrate -- are introduced in such a way as to make you look forward to their future interaction. The story does not begin with the beginning of Morton's career, for he makes numerous references to events in his own past, and the author is already at work on the second volume in the series -- which I look forward to reading.	2001-12-16

II	Books	2	6	11	N	N	A very disappointing sequel	To a long-time fan of alternate history, both fiction and scholarly counterfactuals, this book is a real disappointment, especially compared to the excellent first volume. Most of the &quot;what ifs&quot; the contributors posit are interesting enough. What if Pilate had heeded his wife's dreams and Jesus had been sent back to Galilee uncrucified to die of old age? What if Harold Godwinson hadn't been killed at Hastings and the English had fought the Normans to a standstill? What if Charles V and the Church had had enough of Luther right off the bat and had consigned him to the stake at Worms? And more than twenty others by authors whose work I respect, especially Thomas Fleming, William H. McNeill, and Cecelia Holland (though she's a novelist and not in any way an &quot;historian&quot;). But my complaint is the same in every single case: *Where's the beef?* Each chapter is an historical essay laying out the real-world situation, but none of them actually elaborate on the changes they suggest! It's as if a &quot;real&quot; historian can't be seen actually playing with a counterfactual. What they have to say is interesting, perhaps, but we've seen it all before. I sat down with this book in expectation of a series of challenging mind-experiments in cause and effect -- and I didn't get any. There's a third volume in the works, I believe, and I hope Cowley pays attention to his critics.	2001-12-12

What makes this oversize volume different from all the other illustration-rich heraldry books on the market is its authorship: Henry Bedingfeld is Rouge Croix Pursuivant and Pete Gwynn-Jones is Lancaster Herald, both of them full-time practicing heralds at the College of Arms in London under the authority of the Duke of Norfolk, who is also Earl Marshal of England and therefore responsible for grants of arms. (His grace also contributes a brief foreward to the book.) They've divided up the labor here, with Bedingfeld taking the chapters on heraldic history and development, the workings of the College, and royal heraldry, while Gwynn-Jones is responsible for the chapters on heraldry as art and also its continental aspects. Much useful information is included on English heralds of the past, some of whom were great scholars and innovators while others were only in it for the money. They also investigate the origins of various heraldic monsters, such as the basilisk (based on the hooded cobra). There are a great many illustrations taken from grants and rolls in the College's archives, most of which I've never seen reproduced before.	2001-12-08

But Anarrian society is becoming infected with egoism and bureaucratic attitudes, and Shevek finds himself to deal any longer with the jealous resistance his theories have created among his scientific colleagues. Shevek and his friends undertake the necessity of rebelling against the permanent anarchist rebellion, and this involves Shevek making the journey to Urras, both to pursue his research and to attempt to communicate with the anarchist underground there. It's a fascinating story with very fully realized characters, both in their human personalities and in their sociopolitical attitudes. The Urras-Anarres dichotomy, of course, is a straw man LeGuin has set up for the purposes of exploring how a true anarchist society might function, and she succeeds admirably. This book won both the Hugo and the Nebula, and for good reasons!	2001-12-01

Larry Ballard finds himself sweatily involved with the Japanese exchange student he lusted over in the last book and Trin Morales has to find his courage again after having been beaten to a pulp by the brother of one of his conquests. Yana, the beautiful (and nearly shape-changing) Gypsy is wanted for murder and the king of the Muchwaya tribe decides to hire Daniel Kearny to get her out of it; if Daniel Kearny Associates could successfully repo all those cars from Staley Zlachi and his people, he knows they're good! And then there are the seven outstanding classic cars from the dealer raid that opens the book: You know the guys are going to get them all, but how? Some of the plot points, especially those involving the ape, threw me a little -- and Gores obviously has a thing for Gypsy crime syndicates -- but it's still a good yarn. I've said it before -- any of the DKA series would make a terrific film (and I would cast Bob Hoskins as Kearny).	2001-12-01

I never wanted to paint in oils or acrylics, or anything that advanced; I  just wanted to be able to create good representational drawings and sketches. This apparent artistic inability has been a deep annoyance to me for more than thirty years -- aggravated by all the people who insisted that &quot;anyone can learn to draw.&quot; Unable to find a class for adult beginners anywhere, and being the autodidact type, I've tried to teach myself from how-to books. I've read through dozens of them and have spent serious time trying to learn from at least five or six, but none of them turned out to be very useful, at least not to me.<br /><br />Then I happened across Dodson's book and everything changed. He doesn't spend the whole first chapter describing the tools you need. He doesn't launch into a zen discussion of the &quot;is-ness&quot; of art or play amateur psychologist. He just tells you to sit down, cross your legs, and draw your feet -- and he explains, in very simple terms, just how to go through the process. Look, hold, draw. Look, hold, draw. And it works, it really does. I'm sure all this is old hat to you artists out there, but Dodson is exactly the sort of teacher I've been looking for all these years! There are about fifty exercises on methods and techniques throughout the book and I'm taking my time with them. After three months, I'm about a quarter of way through the book, and my sketch book is looking pretty good. I've learned to restate rather than erase, and I'm getting along just fine with two pencils (HB and 4B) and a Micron pen. I cannot recommend Dodson's methods too highly to anyone who, like me, just wants to learn to draw!	2001-12-01

There are some interesting parallels between the world-setting and even the characters: Gibson and Stephenson both posit semi-anarchic worlds (Stephenson more so), both have teenage main characters who are couriers/messengers (Chevette on a bike, Y.T. on a skateboard), both have adult main characters who are out of the ordinary even in their native societies (Rydell is a rent-a-cop, Hiro is a freelance everything). But where Gibson has a quiet sort of delivery, almost like background music, Stephenson is often no-brakes, over the top. Neal brings in a lot of other very interesting narrative threads, too -- especially Sumerian mythology and neurolinguistic theory. And not to forget the notion of franchised mini-nations and the Mafia as a force for (relatively speaking) good. Hafta to make a note to re-read this one again in ten years. . . .	2001-11-25

Bush, to which he refers approvingly, Dewald offers an extended interpretative essay, the theme of which is the evolution of the Continental nobility (or aristocracy -- he regards the terms as overlapping but distinct in meaning) during the four centuries between the end of the Middle Ages and the arrival of the French Revolution. Though small in absolute numbers, the nobility controlled most of the land and all of the politics on the Continent until well into the 19th century, and the author maintains that they managed to do this despite wars, revolutions, and the coming of modern industry because they were very effective in adapting to the changes around them. He also argues that from one country and culture to the next, nobles faced similar problems and responded to them in very similar ways. Intended as an introductory text on the subject, this is an excellent historical survey for the beginning student.	2001-11-15

This time he's concerned with questions of diversity and mutability: Under what circumstances did the noble class grow or diminish, how did one enter the ranks of the aristocracy, how might one (or one's descendants) be de-nobled, what were the actual difference in station between those nobles who were wealthy and those who were not, and how did the latter dissimilarity affect personal conduct, choice of residence, and the necessity of trade?

His approach is synthetic with heavy reliance on secondary sources, but in that regard this multi-volume work has become the standard resource. The crux of noble privilege, he says, is that for the past thousand years it has been &quot;not merely an expression of social superiority or of economic and political advantage&quot; but &quot;essentially a juridical fact.&quot; Such privilege existed not because of lax enforcement of the law but by explicit legal provision, and the special privileges of the nobility remained generally secure on the Continent until the French Revolution swept most of them away. Moreover, while titles and lands had long been the result of a contract between the aristocrat and the monarch, especially in France, by the 17th century the failure of a noble family to fulfill its obligations toward the ruler no longer resulted in demotion to the ranks. Beyond these general points, and following a discussion of the historical roots of the titled class, the author considers in great detail the nature and character of fiscal exemption and private taxation, judicial privileges and indemnity from state service, parliamentary and office-holding privileges, and the right to rank and title. All of these topics are heavily footnoted and Bush includes a very lengthy bibliography.	2001-11-15

When you're both a student of history and a movie buff, as I am, it can be difficult to sit and watch a film that presumes to have an accurate historical context without fighting the urge to evaluate it and pick holes in it. And I'm not the only one. This is a collection of analytical essays, most of high quality, by experts (not all of them historians) analyzing and critiquing individual films: Stephen Jay Gould on _Jurassic Park,_ Antonia Fraser on _Anne of the Thousand Days,_ Thomas Fleming on _1776,_ Dee Brown on _Fort Apache,_ William Manchester on _Young Winston,_ and numerous others. Sticking to those films about which I have some knowledge of the historical events they claim to portray, most are right on the money. James McPherson, commenting on _Glory,_ points out that while the context and general atmosphere are very well done, and the costuming and so on are exact, there are still deliberate historical errors for the sake of drama; none of the soldiers in Col. Shaw's 54th Massachusetts were ex-slaves, for instance, all of them having been recruited from among the state's free black population. And Catherine Clinton does an excellent job taking the wind out of _Gone with the Wind_'s mythical sails. There's a great deal of good information and criticism here and it's a compliment to say that nearly any of these essays will start an argument.	2001-11-13

This is sort of a &quot;busman's holiday&quot; guide to interesting restaurants in major U.S. cities. Where does Stephan Pyles of Dallas's Star Canyon restaurant go when he wants to eat out? How about Jamie Shannon of Commander's Palace in New Orleans? As it happens, Pyles is a devotee both of The Mansion on Turtle Creek (a hyper-expensive yuppie haven) and Mia's Tex-Mex on Lemmon Avenue, where I used to go myself occasionally for the terrific pork tamales. Likewise, Shannon loves both Bayona and Brigtsen's, at the high end of the eco-culinary scale, and the classic muffulettas at Central Grocery at the lower end. Which tells you that good chefs like a nice cholesterol-wallow, just like the rest of us. My main problems with this book are that I'm not familiar enough with restaurants in Atlanta and Los Angeles and Boston for the too-brief blurbs to really mean anything to me, and -- the down-market comfort food spots notwithstanding -- most of these chefs tend to heavily recommend each other's establishments. Still, it's a great browse, worth picking up at the library to check the professionals' ratings against your own opinions.	2001-11-04

Cal Cunningham is a novelist wannabe, sharing a cheap studio apartment in New York and working as a bookstore shipping clerk. He lives a wild, womanizing life and glibly retails all his sexual adventures to his roommate, Stewart -- but he's totally unable to put a single word on paper. Stewart, a Columbia law student, has a secret life: He's been writing his own novel, based on Cal's own life. And then, just as a horrified and enraged Cal discovers the manuscript, Stewart dies in an accident. Obviously, since the life lived in the manuscript belonged to Cal, the book itself must also belong to Cal. Right? Any struggling, self-doubting, would-be novelist will wince knowingly at Cal's pouring out of his soul in this supposed memoir of how he deals with the complications of stealing Stewart's work, and then his semi-girlfriend, and will sympathize with him more than one would probably care to admit. The pace is headlong, the characterization is very good, the plot twists are ingenious, and this story would make one hell of a movie!	2001-11-04

She's very much the sort of person whom things happen to, rather than taking the lead in her own life. She seems to live in the objective tense. And the sudden advent of her neurotic personality has not very convincing roots. In fact, none of the characters are particularly likeable: Jem is certainly a tragic figure, but she's unreliable and mendacious and seems to make the worst of her life. Flora is also rather tragic, but she's a cold fish, ungrateful for Alice's friendship and self-absorbed. Roland is a polite bigot, unshakeable in his assumed superiority to practically everyone. Matthew is opportunistic and shallow. Giovanni is extremely demanding and manipulative, regardless of the fact that the author portrays him as being sincerely in love with Alice. Alice's parents -- possibly the least objectionable people in the book -- are nevertheless bigoted in their own way and assume that money can buy anything. Iona is the most annoying sort of ignorant adolescent and an intellectual thief as well. But despite all this, Trapido succeeds yet again in involving you in the story. I don't think this one is anything like as good as _Brother of the More Famous Jack_ or _The Travelling Hornplayer,_ but even so it's worth reading.	2001-11-02

Both sides in the Wars of the Roses were self-serving and it took Henry Tudor, founder of a new dynasty, to undertake the reconstruction of English society, restore public order and the Crown's purse, and suppress the evils of bastard feudalism. Lander questions most of these opinions, identifying royal propaganda on both sides and attempting to rehabilitate the quality of 15th century public life. Of most interest, I think, are the essays \\"Marriage and Politics in the Fifteenth Century: The Nevilles and the Wydevilles,\\" \\"Attainder and Forfeiture, 1453 to 1509,\\" and \\"Bonds, Coercion and Fear: Henry VII and the Peerage,\\" all of which deal with the English aristocracy in a turbulent time.

The Court was the center of all power in the country, far more so than in France or Germany. Nor was the English nobility a caste, as in France, but might be considered rather to include all men of knightly rank and above -- perhaps 5,000 by the mid-13th century. There was not a sharp distinction between the relatively small number of men who bore titles and their followers because of the longstanding fellowship among those who bore arms. Nevertheless, those who opposed King John and Henry III represented the wealthiest and most influential segment of the nobility, and Tuck thinks this led to a greater division between the titled and the lesser landowning class in the later medieval period. And when the great barons found in 1327 that they could remove the wholly unsatisfactory Henry II, their self-image and policies changed and no succeeding monarch was ever quite absolute. From the accession of Edward I to the deposition of Edward VI, the relationship between Crown and nobility evolved radically, thanks in large part to what Tuck calls the \\"unfortunate personalities\\" of Edward II, Richard II, and Henry VI.	2001-11-01

This is only one of the issues the author addresses in this generally successful and quite accessible attempt to reconstruct the ruling elite of Anglo-Norman England in many of its aspects. The surprising thing is that with a plethora of works on the Conquest itself, and many studies of individual noble families and specific monarchs, there has been no single work before this on the general development of the aristocracy of Norman England. Even with the limitations necessary in a single-volume monograph, she forms some interesting hypotheses about the relationship between the aristocracy and both the Crown and the Church, how the nobility got its wealth and how they spent it, the function of castle- and hall-building, the evolution of the newly-landed elite into a complete feudal system, and above all the nature of aristocratic power via kinship and marriage. She concentrates on the use of documentary sources rather than the literary evidence, which she feels has been over-used. The footnotes are voluminous and the bibliography is lengthy and very detailed.	2001-11-01

They dealt heavily in image-building, especially Henry VIII and Elizabeth, for the ruler was not merely a personal executive but the center of a rich symbolism expressing all the aspects of authority. The monarch had not only to be (or have been) a chivalrous war leader, but must also show magnanimity and generosity to his subordinates in the peerage and to his people in general -- and he must do it publicly. The king was also responsible to God for his subjects' well-being, which was why it was so important to Henry VIII to produce a son; not to do so was regarded as a sign of divine disapproval. Royal pageantry was also a tool of statecraft, as shown by Edward IV's competition with the glittering court of Burgundy and the attention paid by Henry VIII to the elegance of Francis I. The author deals at length with the sources on which English courts modeled themselves, their often amorphous administrative structure and day-to-day workings, the nature of access to and security within the court (a nobleman had to be sure of his welcome there, which was often the acid test of his personal political status), the political role of royal sports and entertainment, and the nature of factional political maneuvering. Even the architectural layout of the king's place of residence provided context to the court, and the book includes an annotated list of the king's houses, when and by whom they were built, to what use the monarch put them, and their eventual fate. Mining the private and public writings of the peerage for examples, Loades has produced a very readable account of a subtle side of kingship of which most modern students are not even aware -- even though much of what he has to say might also apply to the White House.	2001-10-30

This slender epic is by way of being the prequel to _The Travelling Hornplayer,_ which I unknowingly read first. This one centers on Katherine Browne and her affair with the entire Goldman family: Jake, the Jewish cockney philosophy professor and semi-radical Bohemian; Jane, his wife and supporter of his soul; Roger, the older son, his mother's favorite, and a neurotic math genius; and Jonathan, his father's favorite, all-round bloke and decent sort. Katherine, a very naive and very sweet young girl, first meets Jacob when he interviews her for a university fellowship and later the same afternoon falls under the sway of John Millet, a bisexual aesthete to whom she loses her virginity. John takes her to visit his old friends in the country, who turn out to be the Goldmans. She falls for the beautiful Roger, who turns out to be something of a ...; when he dumps her four years later during graduation week, she departs for Italy and doesn't return for ten years, having had and lost a baby. Then she rediscovers Jonathan. The book divides neatly into two parts, separated by the Italian interlude: Young-and-Vulnerable Katherine and Older-and-Sometimes-Wiser Katherine. The Goldmans have changed a lot during her decade away, but in the essentials they haven't really changed at all. This is a lovely book and it's amazing Trapido could cram so much story into only 218 pages. The scintilating dialogue makes me want to see and hear it on the stage. And the characters, as in _Hornplayer,_ are absolutely believeable.	2001-10-30

But something more is needed: The supporting players who serve as catalysts in the actions of the major roles, and that composite role is known as &quot;Fifth Business.&quot; Dunstable Ramsey is the lifelong catalyst between Percy Boyd Staunton and his inept wife, Leola Cruikshank, and also between the tragic Mrs. Dempster and her son, Paul. All are originally residents of the small rural Ontario community of Deptford, but the rational and decent Ramsey (who changes his first name to &quot;Dunstan&quot;), and the money-driven but also usually decent Percy (who changes his name to &quot;Boy&quot;), and the success-driven but also eventually decent Paul (who changes his name to &quot;Magnus&quot;) rise greatly in the world, though in very different ways. There are any number of parallel themes, but the major one involves Ramsey's search for the supernatural in a merely real world. Davies is a master of in-depth characterization and also exhibits a delightfully droll sense of humor, both of which together will hold your attention to the last page.

This is the first of Trapido's novels I've read and I confess to being thoroughly smitten. This is, to put it oddly, the most beautifully structured novel I've read in many years. There's sixteen-year-old Lydia Dent, who is very close to her one-year-older sister, Ellen. There's Jonathan the Novelist, on whom Lydia develops a serious crush . . . and outside whose flat she is run over by an automobile. There's Jonathan's daughter, Stella the Nuisance Chip, who grows from a very unpromising childhood into an astonishingly beautiful and talented musician. Ellen, Jonathan, and Stella take turns telling the story, each from a quite different viewpoint, and being interrupted occasionally by an omniscient narrator who makes sure the reader is aware of certain things. These key characters are extremely well developed and you'll know them intimately by the end of the book, but even the supporting cast are multi-dimensional: Pen Massingham, the wealthy young Catholic schoolmate of Ellen's and Stella's; Izzy, the thoroughly disgusting young artist of genius; Ellen's and Lydia's stepmother (known to them as The Stepmother); Jonathan's wife, Katherine, who has dedicated her life to her daughter; Sonia, the brilliant and vivacious lover-turned friend -- even Jonathan's younger siblings are drawn believably and with great care. I often imagine how a novel I enjoy could be redone as a film script -- since novels and scripts are very different forms of literature -- but this is one time I'll take a pass. There's absolutely nothing in this very funny, very touching novel that could be excised without fatally damaging all the rest of it. Trapido goes on my permanent &quot;watch&quot; list.	2001-10-27

Keats-Rohan is director of the Unit for Prosopographical Research at Linacre College, Oxford, and this project is an heroic attempt to synthesize the genealogy of families in the first century following the Conquest and the histories of the manors which they either owned or labored on. For &quot;only by determining the identities of persons concealed in a repetitious mass of names in the text of Domesday Book can we hope to understand what happened next, or who was who in subsequent records such as the Pipe Rolls.&quot; Domesday Book contains some 45,000 personal names, many of them duplications since tenants-in-chief held land in several counties. If you also leave out the churches (as tenants) and the surviving English tenants, fewer than 20,000 names remain, and about 8,000 of those are identified by forename alone. The author has analyzed 19,500 records of continental names into about 2,500 individual persons, including some 200 tenants-in-chief and about 600 Englishmen. Their entries, which make up the bulk of this large volume, range from a single sentence (Harduin was a&quot;Domesday tenant of William fitz Nigel under earl Hugh in Chester&quot;) to several pages for those at the top. Citations to appearances in Domesday Book itself, as well as in later charters and other sources, are very complete. The descendants of the great men whom the new king made tenants-in-chief became the great barons of the English feudal system, and nearly all of them appear here. For instance, Eudo Dapifer, son of Hubert de Ryes, married Rohais, daughter of Richard de Clare. One of Eudo's tenants in 1086 was Osbert, husband of his sister Muriel. Eudo also acquired the land previously held by his brother, Adam, who was a tenant of Bishop Odo. Farther down the social ladder were men like Herbrand de Sackville, tenant of Walter de Giffard, who had sons named Jordan, William, and Robert, and a daughter named Avice, who married Walter d'Auffay. The author also has included seventy-five pages of background history and prosopographical methodology, which make this work very accessible to the non-specialist. This is apparently the first published installment (there are also several online databases) of an extraordinary and fascinating enterprise which should open new avenues of research for those interested in medieval English genealogy.s, daughter of Richard de Clare.

There's a good deal of slapstick but more pastiche and sly satire, and Lodge's ear for hilarious dialogue is very evident. The subject matter, however, is now rather outdated, as it concerns the trials and tribulations of a young English Catholic couple who can't quite bring themselves to rebel against the Church's teachings regarding birth control. With three young children in four years of marriage, and now the threat of a fourth pregnancy, both of them are economically and psychologically despondent and sexually frustrated from trying to follow the Rhythm Method. The author himself is Catholic, and one has to wonder if he still believes as he apparently did then.<br />Still, this story of Adam and Barbara Appleby, which spans a single day of Adam's attempts to carry on his thesis research in the Reading Room of the British Museum, raises all the questions of authority vs. conscience that concerned Vatican II. Lodge even manages to bring about a classic comedic denouement without it seeming contrived. Good &quot;historical&quot; reading for the Lodge afficionado. The Penguin edition also includes a revealing introduction by the author discussing the story behind the novel and the themes he was attempting to address.	2001-10-22

The present Lord Clifford inherited the project when his uncle died in 1969, reworked the research already done (with heavy recourse to the library of the House of Lords and the muniment room at the family estate of Ugbrooke), and passed it on to Sir Iain Moncreiffe. Sir Iain, one of the most highly regarded genealogists of the 20th century, corrected the manuscript and added considerable new material. At his death, Noel Currer-Briggs (also a very noted genealogist) took on the editorial role and readied the manuscript for press. With such a provenance, I'm willing to give a high level of trust to the material included. Pons, the founder of the family, was one of the proven companions of Duke William of Normandy and became one of the new king's barons in England. He is thought to have been a scion of the House of Eu (and therefore a grandson of Richard &quot;the Fearless,&quot; the 3rd duke) and he was certainly a close friend of Richard FitzGilbert (founder of the House of Clare) and of Ralf de Toeni (who, Horace Round said, &quot;was no ordinary baron&quot;); the families were soon connected by marriage, as well. Pons's immediate descendants were marcher lords in south Wales, with nearly regal powers, for &quot;in the Welsh March the king's writ does not run.&quot; &quot;Fair Rosamund&quot; Clifford, daughter of Walter FitzPons, was the mistress of Henry II and the probable mother of William Longesp&eacute;e, who became Earl of Salisbury. The subsequent history of the family is laid out with one generation, more or less, per chapter, through the first line of Clifford peers, which ended with the death of 5th Earl of Cumberland in 1633, then through the cadet line from 1357 down to the author himself, the thirtieth of his descent. This line remained Roman Catholic, which complicated things after the Test of 1673. Numerous graphic descent diagrams and lineage charts in the style of Burke's make the discussion easy to follow and there are frequent footnotes, as well as portraits from the 15th century on. Other branches of the family in Devonshire, Northumberland, Kent, Ireland, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands, also are covered in some detail, and there are chapters on the name &quot;Pons&quot; in pre-Conquest Normandy and on the putative descent from Rollo the Viking.

The term &quot;manor house&quot; is not particularly Scottish, nor is a Scots laird a &quot;lord of the manor,&quot; but the feudal similarities are there -- at least until the Victorian period and the pervasive influence of Sir Walter Scott. In practice, the Norman feudal pattern arrived in Scotland very shortly after it was brought to England, and Queen Margaret and her sons formalized the system in the 12th century. A few Scots buildings date to the medieval period, such as Drum Castle in Aberdeenshire, which was erected during the reign of Robert Bruce, but even those houses that are only two or three centuries old are often the seats of families of ancient pedigree. Fenwick is, naturally, an architectural historian, and the bulk of this combination history and guide is given over to discussions of French and Dutch influence, the ubiquity of &quot;doocots&quot; (dovecotes), and the piling of Victorian Gothic ornamentation on facades of much plainer design. However, there is also a great deal of ethnography (e.g., the &quot;separateness&quot; of Fife) and family history threaded throughout, including notes on the Setons, Hopes, Clerks, Forbeses, Grants, Lindsays, and the Earls of Moray, among many others. Scores of black-and-white photos and pen-and-ink drawings of architectural exteriors add to this book's usefulness to the Scottish specialist.	2001-10-21

Then it becomes a character study of four very different people and their interactions. And then it becomes a sort of philosophical/psychological investigation of the meaning of &quot;past&quot; and &quot;future.&quot; Actually, it's all those things, written in a way that will make you lie in bed and think about what you've read each time you quit for the night. The setting is St. Paul, Minnesota, August 1939 to April 1940, more or less -- a nine-month period in which at least two dime-a-dance girls are murdered, in which Lt. Wesley Horner of Homicide tries to convince himself he has solved the crimes, in which Wesley (whose wife has died after their daughter left home) also falls in love with a wise sixteen-year-old vagrant girl who saves him from despair, and in which Herbert White goes from being an large but inoffensive middle-aged man with a very poor memory and a fondness for amateur photography to being a lifer at Stillwater State Prison. You keep waiting for things to turn out &quot;right,&quot; for Lt. Horner to turn up the bit of evidence that will get Herbert off. But, as Lt. Welshinger, a vice cop who believes in evil (and he should know) says to a number of characters, &quot;That's not how the world is.&quot; I sort of expected to be depressed when I finished the book, but I wasn't. And I'm very impressed with Clark's writing.

Like Alan Powers's _Living with Books,_ this beautifully illustrated volume shows you some of the solutions that people obsessed with books have arrived at to house and care for them. Many of the bibliophiles included here are artists, designers, or architects, and they can be counted on to come up with original and striking ideas for the shape and location of book shelves, arrangement of the books themselves. David Hicks has a thing for books bound in red. The Duke of Devonshire has the sort of 19th century English-country-house library you might expect. Loren Rothschild houses his books in a specially castle -- in California. Jack Lenor Larsen has to keep his books out of direct view because he finds them too stimulating otherwise. And who would have guessed that Keith Richards was a dedicated booklover? A number of large and small libraries are included, and there are also sections on bookbinding and restoration, bookplates, how to start a collection, library lighting, and other related topics. A sizeable &quot;Resource Directory&quot; provides lists of book fairs and book dealers and suggests suppliers of library furnishings and equipment.	2001-10-15

I suppose Judy Blume is mostly thought of as a &quot;young people's author&quot; and a &quot;woman's novelist,&quot; but I've always liked her stuff and I've read a large part of it. Her narrative style is simple and straightforward; no fancy vocabulary, no scintillating imagery, just excellent storytelling. And she has a marvelous knack for characterization.<br /><br />This one is about two quite different women who have fled bad marriages for quite different reasons and ended up with new lives in Boulder, Colorado. Margo is the generally sensible one, the mother of two teenagers. B.B. (as Francine is known in her new home) is the brittle one, the perfectionist, mother of an adolescent daughter -- and also of a son who was killed in an auto accident at the age of ten, . . . which none of her friends in Boulder know about. And then Andrew, Francine's ex, comes to town to try to spend more time with his daughter, and Francine sees his arrival as a plot to disturb her carefully managed life. And then Andrew meets Margo, and things begin to get *really* complicated. Margo is a very likeable character, and so are her two kids, and so is Sara, the uneasy and very vulnerable daughter whom B.B. so dominates. And so is Andrew, for all his occasional blue-sky daydreaming, which sets Margo's teeth on edge. B.B., a real piece of work who has pretended about everything all her life, is much less easy to sympathize with, even when she has a breakdown -- which Blume describes in a completely convincing series of scenes. This book would make a terrific film!	2001-10-10

I came across it recently at a university book sale and decided it was time to reread it, and I wasn't disappointed. Calvin Morrison, a Korean War veteran and the son of a minister, is a corporal in the Pennsylvania State Police (an organization for which Piper evidently had a high regard). While preparing to rush a bad guy holed up in a farmhouse, he's sideswiped by a passing Paratime Patrol transtemporal vehicle and gets bounced into an alternate Pennsylvania countryside where the Aryans of India went east instead of west, occupying what did not become China and then crossing the Pacific. Morrison is extremely adaptable -- it apparently takes him only an hour or so to accept what's happened to him and that he's not going back to his own world -- and quickly finds himself &quot;Lord Kalvan,&quot; chief advisor and war leader to Ptosphes, Prince of Hostigos. All in all, this is a delightful exercise in military and geopolitical fantasizing . . . though it seems odd that people who get scooped up willy-nilly and dumped in ancient Rome, or wherever, always seem to possess all the political, historical, and technical knowledge to set themselves up nicely. Of course, if the displaced person were an overweight fries-cooker at Burger King, or a Mary Kay saleswoman, there wouldn't be much of a story! This is by far the best (and longest) of Piper's Paratime stories. If you liked Sprague De Camp's _Lest Darkness Fall,_ you'll love this one!	2001-10-10

I'm not generally a fan of procedurals, but I make an exception for Grafton. By now, Kinsey is a fully realized personality -- as are her landlord, the octogenarian Henry, Rosie the Hungarian tavernkeeper, her acquaintances on the police force, and all the other repeating characters. This time, she has to unravel another missing persons case, the subject of the investigation being a prominent doctor (on his second wife, but she's been hired by the first wife) who seems to have been involved in a Medicare scam. And just to keep things interesting, there's a secondary plot involving two brothers from whom Kinsey is considering renting new office space -- which leads to a couple of fairly unnerving scenes. The plot develops logically and Grafton is adept at letting  you (and Kinsey) stray off on dead-end paths. Nothing important was telegraphed -- not to me, anyway. My only real complaint is probably picky (except that I'm an editor, so it doesn't seem picky to me), and that's the poor job of editing from which the last few books in the series have suffered. For instance, though one of the supporting characters is named Harvey Broadus, when Kinsey finally meets him, he introduces himself as &quot;Harry&quot; Broadus. And the rear entrance to a building is consistently spelled as one word, &quot;backdoor.&quot; Very sloppy. But I'll forgive that for a really good story. Along about the middle of the alphabet, though, Grafton seemed to flag. &quot;L,&quot; &quot;M,&quot; and &quot;N,&quot; were pretty mediocre; in one of those, she used the verb &quot;to tuck&quot; about once every three pages, making me want to scream every time I read it. They also showed a lot of laziness in the research. (She obviously had never personally bothered to check out the area around Dallas!) So I was beginning to worry that the series might never be completed. But &quot;O&quot; was a great improvement, and I'm happy to say that &quot;P&quot; is the best one yet.d.

A chimera is a being produced by gene-splicing human genes with those of assorted mammals, the result being an intelligent &quot;critter&quot; who's not quite a slave -- but who doesn't have much in the way of civil rights, either. Having found that much in the flap copy, I thought immediately of one of my favorite stories: &quot;The Ballad of Lost C'Mell,&quot; by Cordwainer Smith. Well, Zoe Domingo isn't C'Mell and Shetterly isn't Smith, but it's still a pretty good yarn, though a little heavy on the moralizing. What makes it fun is the mix of noir crime fiction style (think Philip Marlowe as a vegetarian PI) and a semi-cyberpunk vision of the future (everyday teleportation, space-warping as a personal &quot;pocket,&quot; and Libertarian terrorists). Two-thirds of the way through, I began to wonder how Shetterly was going to tie up all the narrative threads, but he manages it in quite well -- though I shall be waiting with greater interest for the next &quot;Bordertown&quot; book.	2001-10-05

This well-written and beautifully illustrated survey of the capital's course since its founding by the Romans c.50 A.D. is very satisfying in that regard. Billings, a sort of non-academic historian at the BBC, is heavy on the architecture and archaeology of London's churches, but that's about all that remains from the earlier centuries. He also doesn't have much good to say about the British habit of continually tearing down historical structures and replacing them with badly designed office blocks -- which is all the more frustrating since so little that was built before the 18th century survived both the Great Fire of 1666 and the more recent Blitz.

This one, I happened to pick up at the library because the cover photo caught my eye. I often judge a book by its cover. And this one was a lucky pick. Viva Cohen is a girl, a teenager, a North Londoner, a Jew, and a dedicated virgin, not necessarily in that order of importance. She's also very bright and a terrible student. And an expert on music and films, especially Elizabeth Taylor. She was raised by her Uncle Manny, who is gay and rather wise, and her best mates are a blindingly beautiful blonde her own age (whom she frequently loves and hates at the same time) and a second-tier pop star fifteen years her senior. This is the armature on which Forrest wraps a thoroughly delightful, very funny, very touching story of what it means to be Viva, to discover that you've mis-heard the lyrics to the rock tune that you thought defined your life. The writing crackles, the turn of idiom is droll, and the author is going places.	2001-10-05

The generation that passed between the death of Victoria and the accession of her son, Edward VII, in 1901 and the death of Edward's son, George V, in 1936 was one of great change not only in the British monarchy but in the state of monarchy throughout Europe. Edward's personal power was subject to the close limitations of the unwritten English constitution, but his cosmopolitan personality and astute knowledge of international affairs gave him great informal authority, especially since the emperors of Germany and Russia were his close relations. George, though likeable, shared neither his father's eminence abroad nor his extroverted style, and was much more subordinate to his ministers - and during the early part of his reign, as a result of the Great War, the empires of Germany, Russia, and Austria ceased to exist. The author of this well-researched study, who has written a number of other books and articles on modern European royalty, follows the complex interconnections among the royal houses of Europe during this period, pointing out just how much diplomacy depended before the War on personal relationships between monarchs, and also just how little such things came to matter during the subsequent Age of Dictators. He includes a great many photographs and illustrations, many of which are new to me, as well as a (necessary) genealogical chart and table of accession dates.	2001-10-05

There?s something about British humor that no other English-language literature will ever be able to supplant. The narrator -- whose name we never learn -- is a young odd-jobs-man who is presently on holiday with his motorbike and tent in the Lake District. It?s late summer, he?s been at the campground a week, and he?s about to depart, when Tommy Parker offers him a bit of temporary employment painting the front gate. One thing leads to another, and the narrator finds himself responsible for painting a flock of rowboats, cutting firewood (on loan, as Mr. Parker seems to have rented him out), spending his evenings at the local pub (where he?s recruited for the darts team), and being drafted by 15-year-old Gail Parker to do her homework. But money almost never changes hands. Everyone in the area knows everything about everyone else -- including him, he discovers. And then Mr. Deakin, the milkman disappears into the lake while helping locate the new mooring raft, and the narrator finds himself with the milk route, as well. The story is perfectly deadpan, in a very sly, droll way, and the effect is cumulative and almost Hitchcockian -- especially the last page! Even though one might get annoyed with the narrator for allowing himself to be so thoroughly taken advantage of, this is a most delightful yarn.	2001-09-06

It's also the story of Michael Brady, a casual friend from college who becomes Jonathan's near obsession, an Irish Catholic whose personal morality will not permit him to bend to the will of the army he so loathes.

I strongly dislike those interminable series of novels which are written only because they can be sold (think Terry Brooks), not because they're worth writing. They cease being fiction worth reading and become only product. I fear Baker's &quot;Novels of the Company&quot; series may be moving in that direction. _In the Garden of Iden_ was pretty good, a story of engineered immortals spending their centuries in the service of a far future commercial operation known as &quot;Dr. Zeus,&quot; preserving works of art and endangered species (since time travel only works one way). Mendoza, recruited in the 16th century, is a 18-year-old botanist for the Company who goes to study now-vanished medicinal plants in the garden of Walter Iden in England and then falls in love with an ardent protestant, Nicholas Harpole, who eventually dies at the stake for his faith. The second novel, _Sky Coyote,_ wasn't nearly as good. Mendoza is mostly an onlooker this time in early 18th century California as immortal agents of the Company persuade an Indian tribe to allow itself to be completely relocated to a Company preserve. The writing is well crafted, but the plot meanders and Baker indulges herself with lengthy retellings of Indian mythology and folktales. _Mendoza in Hollywood_ is even more annoying, I'm afraid. Mendoza is once more the central character, in Los Angeles of 1862, manning a stage stop with a team of other immortal researchers and collectors of scientific specimens -- but there's really no plot furthering the series story line until a British imperialist conspiracy that appears only in the last hundred pages. And this time, Baker spends a great deal of time retelling the action of several D. W. Griffith films! This could have been (perhaps should have been) a 100-page novella. Well, the fourth volume is sitting on my desk so I might as well see if this obviously talented author can get back on track. . . .	2001-08-20

Of any living writer, Tim Powers is the undisputed master of the &quot;secret history,&quot; the conspiracy within the conspiracy, and this may well be his most intriguing (so to speak), best developed, and best written example of that genre yet. I generally prefer his earlier stuff -- especially _Anubis Gates_ and _Drawing of the Dark_ -- to more recent titles like _Expiration Date_ or _Earthquake Weather._ But in those early works, most of the background of his tapestry was fictional. This time, everything outside of the Declare conspiracy itself is very close to absolute fact, which Powers has reinterpreted in oh, so plausible ways to fit his story. His characters ring true, too: Andrew Hale, recruited to the most Secret Service at the age of seven. Elena, Spanish Catholic turned Russian Communist agent turned semi-French Catholic again. And the repellent Kim Philby, master spy, master traitor,  and a thoroughly disgusting little snot . . . even though Powers shows you why he turned out that way. I believe it's time to go back and re-read all of Powers's old books, while I wait for his next one!	2001-08-17

In addition to formal heraldry, many noble families and individuals through history have adopted informal, personal visual emblems and symbolic phrases and mottoes. Ferdinand &quot;the Catholic&quot; of Spain employed the Gordian knot cleft with a sword --  to symbolize his conquest of Moorish Granada -- and the motto &quot;Tanto mounta&quot; (&quot;Tantamount&quot;) to indicate his assumed equality with his queen, Isabella (a notion which the Castilians never admitted). The book brims with addictive miscellanea and minutiae of history at the personal level. Feuds, jealousy, and ambition from all corners of Europe are represented . . . and more than a few puzzles, such as the intended symbolism behind the device of &quot;an elephant looking at the moon in adoration.&quot;	2001-08-10

Many, many names appear in his work that were previously collected nowhere else. The father and son team of V. Rolland and H. V. Rolland took twenty-three years to complete the monumental work (the Supplement), which eventually included more than 100,000 distinct blazons. The Rollands' six volumes of illustrations were intended to make life easier for those to whom formal heraldic language was as foreign as the French in which Rietstap wrote his descriptions. For uncommon names, and especially for non-English names, Rietstap and all the supplementary volumes to his original work can often provide a jumping-off point -- the discovery that, somewhere in the past, a family in which you're interested was important enough to be entitled to coat-armor.<br />And to the previious reviewer who complained that this was all in French -- if you have a serious interest in heraldry, you'd *better* have some familiarity with French, not to mention Latin!	2001-08-10

Relatively nontechnical, considering the subject, and there is a sampling of many subordinate topics: The history of heraldry, defini-tions and specialized terminology, the visual art of armory, differencing and cadency, the crest and motto, royal heraldry and orders of knighthood, and &quot;recent trends and developments.&quot; Well-illustrated, including numerous color plates.	2001-08-10

The exquisite and sometimes radical interpretations of many artists may be found here. The royal arms and supporters have been rendered in humorous but friendly style and they have been lampooned and caricatured in decidely unfriendly fashion.

The worst thing that can be said about it is almost everything else. The 1883 edition, with its supplement, picks up all those titles which had died out and therefore were not in the later editions of Burke's Peerage. Arrangement is by family name, rather than by title, so one does get a sense of the power the great families accumulated. The amount of narrative detail varies from almost nonexistant to extended Victorian hyperbole, dates are very spotty, and minor factual errors are rife. So use this to outline the rise and decline of a family and its branches, and then go to the Complete Peerage for reliable details.	2001-08-10

He was arguably the greatest historian of medieval Europe, and in his methods he has often been compared to Thucydides. &quot;Heimskringla&quot; means &quot;the world is round&quot; -- appropriate for a people who considered the entire world their arena -- and is the overall title given to his collection of earlier sagas, rationalized and pruned of recognizable nonsense, which is still the basis of history in the North. Snorri's style is simplicity itself and because &quot;history&quot; until very recently concerned itself with the actions of great men, he spends considerable time detailing the interrelationships among the many leaders of Scandinavia -- and especially of Harald &quot;Fairhair,&quot; who conquered and united the many domains of those leaders. (Why &quot;Fairhair&quot;? Read the saga.) The roots of William the Conqueror are here, as well as those of Canute and St. Olaf. This simply-illustrated edition noted above runs to nearly 900 pages and is generally regarded as the best, but any will do.

Most published lineages on the British monarchy are interested primarily in the line of succession, which usually has been male. Descendants of female royals generally get short shrift, but Weir provides at least basic information on all children and grandchildren of each sovereign, together with their spouses. This makes connections to other highly placed English and Continental families and to the royalty of other countries much easier to follow. Coverage is from Egbert in the late eighth century to the present day -- including Scotland -- and the index is very well done (and necessary). An eleven-page bibliography leads the reader to a large number of other secondary works. The only thing missing here is footnotes citing sources -- but the reader should rely on the _Complete Peerage_ for that and use Weir as a ready reference tool only.

The saga traces the lives of the Norse rulers of the Orkney, Faroe, and Shetland islands from the ninth century to the thirteenth. Written down about 1200 A.D. (by an unknown Icelander), it predates the Heimskringla by a generation and was one of Snorri's principal sources.<br />So why should a peerage genealogist be interested in the Orkneys? Because Turf-Einar, created first earl (&quot;jarl,&quot; actually) by Harald Fairhair, was a brother of Hrolf the Ganger, first &quot;duke&quot; of Normandy, both being sons of Rognvald, jarl of More. Various of the Orkney earls also were related by blood or marriage to the rulers of Norway and Denmark and to the Scottish earls of Moray. Because the saga was originally an oral history, it deals in varicolored language and vivid detail and powerful oration --  most of which the translators have managed to preserve in their prose rendition.<br />If you have any interest at all in the northern lands and in the heroic deeds and blood feuds of an earlier, less gentle time, this volume will hold your attention (but don't forget to take notes).	2001-08-09

Dr. Weis died in 1966 and Walter Lee Sheppard, himself a renowned genealogist, undertook (successfully) to main-tain his high standards; the 4th and subsequent editions have been the result of his own editorial labors. A very inexpensive work, especially compared to many of the other titles on this subject; this one should be on every genealogist's bookshelf.	2001-08-09

I'm not ordinarily fond of high fantasy; even Tolkien is rather wearing to me. But Moon, an ex-USMC officer, is quite different from Tolkien. This is, in large part, a military adventure, especially the early part, which concentrates on the training and blooding of a young mercenary named Paksenarrion Dorthansdotter. But strewn throughout that first volume are also a great many clues to the resolution of the ultimate quest in the third volume . . . by which time Paks has become something a great deal more than a simple soldier. Moon shows herself a master of character development as well as military maneuver and Paks, Duke Phelan, the Marshal-General of Gird, Master Oakhallow the Kuakgan, Sergeant Stammel, Aliam Halveric, Captain Arcolin, Arvid Semminson the Thieves Guild agent -- even Jos Hebbinford, the innkeeper of Brewersbridge -- and scores of other principal and supporting figures are painted in great depth. And not only the human characters but also the elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-elven rangers with whom Paks comes in contact and through whom she becomes all she can be. This is very high quality heroic fantasy with a fully realized hero.	2001-08-09

Volume 1 contains the preeminent orders -- Garter, Bath, Victorian Order, etc. -- each list being chronological and providing full names and dates of all persons invested, so far as information was available. (It seems astonishing that the registers of the Order of the Thistle, which began in 1687, were lost c1830 and not rediscovered until the turn of this century!)<br />Volume 2 is a chronological list of knights bachelors -- &quot;ordinary&quot; knights -- from the introduction of the Angevin dubbing ceremony c1250. Shaw's articulate essays on each order, and on the system of knights bachelors (and why most fief-holders didn't want to join), provide an antidote to American confusion on this subject.	2001-08-09

The principal theme, though, is that all of these extended families are of mixed blood, politically unified by matrimonial alliances stretching from Norway to Yugoslavia -- but that such ties did not prevent continuing national feuds. World War I, at the top levels, was a family brawl. Well-written and insightful; an altogether entertaining account.	2001-08-01

From Alan, the &quot;dapifer&quot; or steward of Dol in Normandy in the 12th century, to Robert II, first Stuart King of Scots, to Henry Stuart, Cardinal of York, who was proclaimed &quot;Henry IX&quot; by his adherents and who died childless in Rome in 1807, the Stuart dynasty had probably a greater impact on the social and political develop-ment of Great Britain than any other of its ruling houses. Lacking notes and other scholarly apparatus, this is recommended simply as a first reader on the House of Stuart.	2001-08-01

Barnum, so the reader may be forgiven for unfounded suspicions of tabloidism. The second half of this workmanlike narrative does, in fact, concern itself mostly with the lively affairs of the current younger generation but the reader may ignore all that (or the reader may try).<br /><br />For the first half details in sweeping prose the adventurous history of the Grimaldis, &quot;an ambitious, hot-blooded, unscrupulous race, keen to plunder, swift to revenge, and furious in battle.&quot; The harbor at Monte Carlo has been strategically important since the Carthaginian fleet anchored there. The Lombards, Arabs, Guelfs, and Genoese all had their strongholds and the Grimaldi family arrived in 1162 as Genoese consuls. One night in 1297, Francesco Grimaldi (known as &quot;the Spiteful&quot;) climbed the cliffs with his followers, disguised as monks, and overpowered the small garrison, and the family has ruled the Rock ever since. Edwards makes clear the necessary nerve and tenacity and the willingness to fight, as well as the diplomatic balancing act the princes of Monaco have had to perform in order to survive as a more or less independent state.	2001-08-01

Founded as a family of some power and fortune by Ednyfed Fychan who served Llewellyn the Great in the early 13th century, the Tudors had nearly as much English and French blood as Welsh in their veins when Henry Tudor, a little-known political refugee, staked his future on a single coup d'etat -- and won. Henry VII descended from Edward III through his maternal line and wrapped up the Wars of the Roses by his marriage to the neice of the king he had defeated at Bosworth Field. This well-written volume supplies the context for England's break with the Church of Rome and its part in the Renaissance that followed.	2001-08-01

Even at the highest levels of the royal court, Tudor government involved a great deal more than three kings and two (or three) queens. Interwoven with and surrounding the Tudors were eight other great families who supplied queen consorts, mistresses, courtiers, generals and admirals, high state officials, and ambassadors -- the Brandons, Greys, Howards, Seymours, Dudleys, Cecils, Talbots, Sidneys, and Devereux - who were also complexly related among themselves. This era often seems more of a soap opera than any other period in the history of the English monarchy, filled as it was with wealth and poverty, ambition and failure, crownings and beheadings, high statesmanship and low cunning -- and, everywhere, politics. On more than a few occasions, these families were willing to sacrifice their sons and daughters in their quest for power. And what makes this period accessible to modern readers was the development during the English Renaissance of letter-writing as we know it. Great quantities of 15th and 16th century correspondence have survived to detail every aspect of private and public business, personal opinions, pleas for mercy, and jockeying for power. The second major theme of this volume is the constant replenishing of the nobility by the gentry since, on average, noble families lasted only three generations. Hence, Charles Brandon, best buddy of Henry VIII, who went from gentleman to duke in five years, largely on the strength of his engaging personality. The Howards also went up, down, and up again in less than two generations and have retained the Earl Marshal's baton ever since. And, though he left no progeny, Thomas Wolsey typifies the self-made man: from humbly-born cleric to Bishop of Lincoln to Archbishop of York, Cardinal, and Chancellor of England. A beautifully illustrated and very readable book.	2001-08-01

He was also the richest and most powerful subject in England for most of his life -- and probably the most deeply and widely hated. He was certainly the principal target of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. A key player in the Hundred Years War, he was also on close terms with John Wycliffe and Geoffrey Chaucer. John's controversial career is thus at the very heart of English society and European politics during one of the nation's most turbulent periods, and this semi-scholarly and authoritative examination of the duke's mental processes, institutional goals, and dynastic ambitions is very useful to the understanding of England on the brink of a three-generation civil war.	2001-08-01

All the first four Howard dukes were attainted, the 3rd duke escaped execution only because Henry VIII died that morning (though two of his neices who became queens of England were beheaded), the 4th duke was unjustly executed, the 5th duke went insane, the 6th duke was excluded from public life because of his Catholicism, the 7th duke's wife left him in a public scandal, the 8th duke died prematurely, the 9th duke was childless and saw the end of his branch of the family, the 10th duke died an alcoholic, the 11th duke lost two wives and produced no legitimate children, the 12th duke's wife left him shortly after their marriage, the 13th duke's eldest son died suddenly just before his majority, the 14th duke died young and painfully, and the 15th duke's only son was born blind and epileptic. As the leading Catholic family in England, they were aristocratic outlaws -- yet they were and are that nation's premier peers, hereditary marshals of England, and possessed of great wealth. The author (who is Fitzalan Pursuivant Extraordinary) makes clear that high title is no guarantee of success or happiness. And yet their dukedom has survived for more than five centuries. As Earl Marshal, the 16th duke was responsible for organizing the corona-tions of two sovereigns, the funerals of two more (as well as that of Sir Winston Churchill), and the investiture of the present Prince of Wales; with the advent of radio and television, this made him widely recognized to the public at large. Semi-scholarly (there are numerous footnotes) and heavily illustrated, this volume is most instructive to the general reader and of particular interest to the student of peerage pedigrees.	2001-08-01

The duke's granddaughter, Jane Grey, died for her legacy at the age of sixteen, a Protestant intellectual challenging the accession of the Catholic Mary Tudor. Jane's sister Catherine subsequently ruined her chances to become heir-presumptive to Elizabeth I by her unauthorized marriage to the earl of Hertford -- and then by presuming to give birth to a healthy son (seven of whose close relatives lay buried headless under the chapel in the Tower where he was christened). The Suffolk drama would have been a fitting subject for a Shakespear-ean tragedy.	2001-08-01

The Spanish Bourbons are back on the throne now in the person of King Juan Carlos, who seems to be doing a much better job than some of his idiosyncratic ancestors. The first was Philip V, who reluctantly left the magnificent court of his grandfather, Louis XIV of France; he built his new palace far from Madrid so he could effectively avoid involvement in the affairs of state. His grandson, Charles IV, spent six hours every day hunting; the country was administered in his absence by his wife and her lover -- much to his relief. And after Napoleon, the restored monarchy in Spain was *really* incompetent. A thoroughly documented volume that nevertheless avoids overacademization.	2001-08-01

Founded by the wiley oligarch Cosimo (called Pater Patriae), the enormously wealthy Medici became Grand Dukes of Tuscany and provided some of Europe's most colorful statesmen, popes, soldiers, scholars, and patrons of the arts. They were the embodiment of the Renaissance in Italy and they ruled Florence, frequently controlled the papacy, and influenced the policies of the entire Continent for 300 years. Princesses married them, kings borrowed money from them, other city states feared them, and Michelangelo and Botticelli worked for them.

To the descendants of Rurik, the Romanovs were social-climbing parvenus when the first of them -- Michael, a nephew-by-marriage of Ivan IV &quot;the Terrible&quot; -- came to the throne in 1613. But for the next three centuries, the family ruled the largest nation on earth. Among their number were weaklings and ironhanded autocrats, murderers and religious mystics, certifiable idiots and world-class leaders of great vision. Even the ablest, though, such as Peter the Great and Catherine the Great, were victims of the Russian national irony: All their accomplishments were undone within a generation. This saga of mysterious and violent death, insatiable appetites of all kinds, and intrafamilial scheming rivals TV soap operas for plot twists.

Warlike and ambitious as well as shrewd and progressive, he spread his rule from the Baltic to the Black Sea and from the Dvina River to the Volga. The Orthodox Church regards him as Equal to the Apostles' and the author, whose books have received a number of distinguished awards, obviously agrees with that judgment.

All this activity produced an elaborate body of heroic litera-ture in Scandinavia and it is the northern viewpoint rather than the English that Smyth adopts. The first of the lot was Ragnar Loðbrok (which translates roughly as &quot;hairy ass&quot;), who perished sword in hand, according to tradition, in the snake pit of King Aella of Northumbria. Ragnar's ancestry is unknown and probably unprovable but his progeny claimed as their grandfather Sigurd Ring -- the &quot;Siegfried&quot; of the Niebelungenlied. His sons seized on their father's murder as justification for a retaliatory invasion but the process actually was one of economic and population pressure. Genealogy figures prominently in this study, since so many of the conqueror-rulers were blood-related. And what the monks of Lindis-farne recorded as pirate raids were, to the Norse, a well-organized campaign to occupy the fertile British Isles. This volume in the Oxford Historical Monograph series is a very readable treatment (supported by thorough footnotes and an extensive bibliography) of one of the main skeins of the history, language, and political tradition of England.	2001-07-27

Of particular interest are the chapters on two rogue subgroups -- the great landowning families who are nevertheless untitled commoners and those military or professional middle-class families who achieved titles without possessing much acreage. The unannotated bibliography is a useful starting point for further reading. All in all, a well-informed and well-written treatment by two blokes with hyphenated names.	2001-07-27

(She got one on the third try, after this book was published.) One cannot become an aristocrat, she says; one can only be born one. But her family works at it. Besides being the largest landowners in Germany, they own farms in Georgia (U.S.), a big piece of the Matto Grosso, and eleven castles and palaces, among a great many other holdings. The Duke of Edinburgh, invited to a boar hunt, expressed disbelief that a private family could live so grandly without receiving (as the Windsors do) financial assistance from the state. &quot;What do you expect?&quot; responded Prince Johannes. &quot;No workey, no money.&quot; Lacey gives a similarly witty, insightful, and fascinating view of the Duke of Westminster (the richest man in England), the Duchess of Medinaceli (owner of more than a hundred castles and fifty titles), Prince Franz Josef of Liechtenstein, and several more of their elite colleagues. There's also quite a lengthy bibliography but this is worth reading for the anecdotes alone.	2001-07-27

Then things began to fall apart and this rather scholarly work attempts to explain why. The popular assault on &quot;landlordism,&quot; the proliferation of titles, the democratic revolution, the question of Irish independence, the escape of many of the nobility to the farther corners of the empire where they could still wield something like their old power, the institution of life peerages, plus the leveling effects of two world wars -- all took their toll and resulted in today's titled elite becoming, for the most part, an elegant anachronism surviving precariously on the margins of British society. The author's style and wit are especially evident in his vignettes of such characters as Wilfrid Blunt, Lord Howe, and the Mitford sisters, but this book will still demand some intellectual commitment from the reader.	2001-07-27

There are extensive chapters on heraldry, peerage law, orders of knighthood, the Scottish clans, and the whole system of titles. This should be required reading for anyone attempting British genealogical research of any kind, especially when faced with a claim to Roman or ancient Celtic descent.

Books	4	1	1	N	N	REquired reading for students of Russian history	This is a history not of Russia but of the men and women who ruled that ever-medieval country from the accession of Ivan IV (&quot;the Terrible&quot;) through the deaths of Nicholas II and his family at the hands of the Bolsheviks. No general review of this kind has been produced -- in any language -- before this was first published in 1968, and the author does a very competent job of explaining the complex and ruthless personalities and often puzzling actions of the autocrats who created the largest, yet one of the poorest countries in the world. The tsars and empresses tended to be excessively active or passive; Ivan IV went everywhere and did everything while his son Theodore was entirely lacking in initiative. Again, Peter I (&quot;the Great&quot;) was extraordinarily creative while Nicholas I devoted his considerable energies and enterprise to crushing the enterprise of others. The idiosyncracies and scandals (a word which derives from the Russian: &quot;skandaly&quot;)were also writ large, rivaling the fictional families of Dostoevsky. Hingley manages to maintain a proper balance between anecdote and solid historical writing. The result is highly informative and very entertaining.	2001-07-27

Well, so does every ordinary family, but &quot;black sheep&quot; with titles get more press. After investigating the effects of primogeniture on the younger sons of the English aristocracy  especially in a earlier era when lack of prospects could not be readily balanced by a talent for commerce or the arts  Sykes regales the reader with the lurid exploits of &quot;mad drinkers&quot; such as John Wilmot, earl of Rochester (known as &quot;Rake Rochester&quot;) and champion spendthrifts such as the 5th marquess of Anglesey, who died at the age of thirty having gone through more than £50 million. Then there was the infamous John Knatchbull, younger son of a baronet and brother of one of Robert Peel's ministers, who destroyed his promising naval career with gambling debts and later was transported to Australia for picking pockets. He was subsequently convicted of forgery and further exiled to tiny Norfolk Island; after serving that sentence he committed a brutal murder and was publicly hanged at Sydney in 1844. An altogether entertaining look at the side of the aristocracy Debrett's chooses to ignore.	2001-07-27

Of these, only three -- Norfolk, Somerset, and Hamilton -- predate Charles II, who created four dukedoms for his illegitimate sons. Nevertheless, the present hereditary dukes bear the names (and subordinate titles) of the great medieval and Tudor families: Fitzalan, Howard, Seymour, Vere, Douglas, Montagu, Mowbray, Percy, Beaufort, and Fitzgerald, among others. Moreover, only two of the surviving dukedoms -- Marlborough and Wellington -- were conferred originally on men who held no hereditary title of any kind at the start of their careers. And with present sentiment regarding hereditary peerages at its lowest ebb in centuries, there are unlikely to be any new creations. Some dukes lived like potentates with miniature courts, others made shrewd marriages, many were active Whigs, some heeded the warnings of the Industrial Revolution and established philanthropies and learned societies.

He also presents a balanced view of 16th century monarchy, since the consolidation of the Habsburg state was essentially the result of a skillful series of bilateral agreements between greater and lesser rulers.

The Baroque era is recent enough in our history to have had considerable influence on our own century (many of the royal houses examined lasted until the Great War) and the author seems genuinely to regret that in a modern egalitarian democracy the distinc-tions of &quot;Gentlemen&quot; and &quot;Ladies&quot; are relegated to public platforms and public restrooms, where everyone qualifies.	2001-07-27

The composition and work of the ducal council is also explained, since the council was made up of the duke's senior administrators and lawyers, upon whom the family relied heavily. The Staffords also used litigation rather than combat as their preferred means to an end. Moreover, they were instrumental in causing the crown to change its attitudes toward the nobility as a whole.

This extremely detailed test case begins with the progeny of Count Odo of Orl&eacute;ans and Ingeltrud of Paris in the 9th century and continues through Otto of Hammerstein, the last true Konradiner in the Hessian homeland. Those readers to whom this family means nothing will gain nevertheless by the author's tightly argued and rigorously documented work because (for example) the concept of explicit, inferential, and incidental data is as useful in 19th century England as in medieval Germany.

He acceded as Richard III, the &quot;princes in the Tower&quot; were never seen again, and the Plantagenet royal line ended two years later at Bosworth Field. Ironically, the victor there, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, was descended on one side from a legitimized bastard of one of Edward III's sons and on the other from a Welsh clerk who had secretly married a former queen of England. It might be said that the crowning of Henry VII marked the low point of the concept of legitimacy in determining the succession to the throne of England. Medieval monarchs married not for love, of course, but for political reasons -- to acquire territory or to cement alliances. Personal compatibility and mutual consent were irrelevant (with occasional exceptions, such as Edward IV's secret marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, which outraged his advisors). The Church preached the indissolubility of the marriage bond but that didn't carry much weight with the aristocracy and the monarch. So it's not surprising that kings had mistresses. Sometimes these were casual liasons, sometimes the relationship spanned many years and produced multiple offspring. Henry I had twenty illegitimate children whom he acknowledged, and three or four others have good claims. Adding in the unknowns who didn't survive early infancy, a total of forty bastards by this one king is not impossible. (Even Charles II only managed sixteen.) The exceptions also are surprising: William the Conqueror, himself a bastard, was singled out by the chroniclers for the purity of his personal life. The authors examine in great detail the sort of women who became royal mistresses between the Conquest and Bosworth, what sort of future awaited their offspring, and why some of those children went to the headsman's block for rebellion while others had distinguished military and diplomatic careers and founded noble lines of their own. Detailed lineages are supplied and discussed at length, which makes this a very useful source in an area not often covered in sufficient detail, as well as an intriguing study in its own right.while others had distinguished military and diplomatic careers and founded noble lines of their own.

In this memoir, written only days after the event and subtitled &quot;the Famous Flier's Own Story of His Life and His Transatlantic Flight, Together With His Views on the Future of Aviation,&quot; the &quot;Lone Eagle&quot; tells about his childhood, how he acquired his first plane, his career as a stunt flier, his training in the Army Air Corps, and his work as an Air Mail pilot (including his four emergency parachute jumps).

How can we keep our professional lives from destroying our private lives? How can good manners be squared with the ideals of American life? The Kennedy School of Government at Harvard invited Judith Martin (i.e., Miss Manners) to come and deliver its John M.

She's actually a very skilled practical anthropologist and sociologist, with a lively interest in what sets our theoretically classless American culture apart from the rest of the world. And she has maintained for years that &quot;proper&quot; -- which is to say &quot;common sense&quot; -- etiquette is the very linchpin of a democratic, egalitarian society.

It's sometimes difficult for Americans to understand how the titled class in Great Britain manages to hang on and on, in what is supposed to be a democracy. In fact, under various Labour governments, Britain has been far more radically socialist than the United States -- but the dukes and earls and barons have always survived. Is it just the British love of tradition? Probably not. In fact, Winchester makes a very good argument, well supported by charts and tables, that class is still alive and well in the U.K. and that the upper class still controls the nation's land to a startling degree. A number of inquiries, even by the government, over the past century have been unable to nail down just how much land each peer controls, but the author estimates the total at something like four million acres -- not much to a large Texas rancher, perhaps, but that constitutes about one-third of all the land area of Britain. And it's in the hands of fewer than 1,500 families.<br /><br />This is not something British aristocrats really want publicized and, in fact, they go to some lengths to at least obfuscate it. Winchester actually had finished this book in 1978, but his publishers came under assault by a number of titled persons who figured in it. The legal system in Britain pretty much allows individuals who are the subjects of books, no matter how much in the public eye they may be, to suppress such works before publication. It was only with the assistance of a few sympathetic specialist lawyers - especially Sir Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk, the foremost authority on peerage lore in Britain -- that his work finally saw the light of day.<br /><br />But this lively volume is far from being a dry socioeconomic study! Winchester went and visited as many dukes and earls as would talk to him (some did), as well as chatting up a broad sampling of the barons who constitute the lower rungs of the aristocracy. Some of these, such as the Duke of Devonshire and Baron Mowbray, he seems to approve of, more or less. In other cases, he lets the man's personality and opinions speak for themselves. And it's not a clich&eacute; that hunting, fishing, dining, and collecting account for the majority of interests of a great many of the titled. Winchester also describes at length the qualitative differences among the five ranks of the peerage: The special place of the dukes, who are far, far higher on the ladder than even the marquesses next below them; the fact that retiring prime ministers have traditionally been created viscounts; the peculiar inferiority complex of many among the ranks of the barons.<br /><br />There are also some curious effects that follow enoblement.&quot;Those who carry a title as a consequence of their birth are not in one single case as distinguished in any field as was the first holder of the title; in every single case they are either as comfortably settled as was the first holder or are considerably more settled than was that first holder. . . . In short, the elevation to the peerage has brought the group firmly within the Palace gates of the Establishment, yet appears to have done little to increase their usefulness, as a group, to the society that honoured their forebears. Small wonder that most peers, of recent and of ancient creation, are reluctant to give up what privileges they have.&quot; So while the author has nothing personal against most of the peers he has observed, he does not think stripping the upper class of most of its acreage and the House of Lords of its remaining legislative powers would be a bad thing.<br /><br />There's also a great deal of anecdotal history in this book (or it might have been considerably thinner), most of it fascinating and some of it hilarious. The heralds and pursuivants who make up the staff of the College of Heralds often do not approve of those to whom titles and arms are granted, for instance -- and you don't want to annoy someone with a title like Portcullis or Rouge Dragon!approve of, more or less.

Small wonder that most peers, of recent and of ancient creation, are reluctant to give up what privileges they have.&quot; So while the author has nothing personal against most of the peers he has observed, he does not think stripping the upper class of most of its acreage and the House of Lords of its remaining legislative powers would be a bad thing.<br /><br />There's also a great deal of anecdotal history in this book (or it might have been considerably thinner), most of it fascinating and some of it hilarious. The heralds and pursuivants who make up the staff of the College of Heralds often do not approve of those to whom titles and arms are granted, for instance -- and you don't want to annoy someone with a title like Portcullis or Rouge Dragon!	2001-07-04

It's hard to tell whether Connie Willis is writing the same book everytime, or whether each one is very different. Maybe both, but they're always \\"novels of ideas.\\" Twenty pages into this one, I found myself wading through a molasses of biochemical jargon and thought, \\"I'll never be able to finish this.\\" But then I got into the metaphorical parallels between the hospital and the TITANIC (all those passages . . .), between death and Alzheimer's (which is \\"dying by pieces\\"), and between the courage of a very young, slowly dying patient and the courage of those who stay behind on a sinking ship (\\"grace under pressure,\\" as someone once said). And not only did I finish -- after the absolutely gripping shocker on page 417, I had to stay up until 2:00 in the morning to find out what happened. (Don't attempt to read that chapter and what comes after unless you have a few hours available in a quiet room by yourself!)<br /><br />Willis is always a master of characterization as well as language. Dr. Joanna Lander, the clinical psychologist researching near death experiences, is Connie's best sort of sympathetic but very human protagonist. Dr. Richard Wright, the endocrinologist who recruits her to help with his own experiments in inducing NDEs, is absolutely believable. The smarmy and selfrighteous Maurice Mandrake is, unfortunately, also believable -- but why does everyone always refer to him as \\"Mr. Mandrake\\"? Vielle the ER nurse and Maisie the disasterologist and Kit the numbed caregiver and Mr. Brierley who teaches everyone and Mr. Wojakowski the yarn-spinner of the YORKTOWN, all make up a beautifully realized supporting cast. The humor threaded through this lengthy exploration on the metaphor and symbolism surrounding death will keep you on an even keel. And the ending -- which carefully does *not* answer all the reader's questions -- is perfect. In fact, the last couple of chapters show Connie as the literary near-genius she can sometimes be. You almost wonder if she died and sent this manuscript back from the Other Side. I put this one right up there with \\"Lincoln's Dreams\\" and \\"Doomsday Book.\\"d and sent this manuscript back from the Other Side. I put this one right up there with \\"Lincoln's Dreams\\" and \\"Doomsday Book.\\"	2001-07-04

The disappearance of Amelia Earhart, the fate of Martin Bormann and the LADY BE GOOD, and the German motivation in shooting down Leslie Howard's plane are almost the only &quot;mysteries&quot; investigated. &quot;How close was Hitler to perfecting the atomic bomb?&quot; is an interesting sidelight on the war, but it's not a mystery, nor is the self-sinking of the submarine TANG in 1944. Many of the illustrations included are pure padding and have little or nothing to do with the subject under discussion, and because the author is a Brit, he stretches to include details of British involvement in events in which they were very peripheral.	2001-06-27

I'm one of those who grew up in the `50s with the Dr. Seuss books, and I still enjoy them. But I was somewhat disappointed with this collection of his editorial cartoons from 1941-42. Partly, that's because his creativity seems to have stumbled in doing them -- especially if you compare his work to, say, Herblock's wartime cartoons. And partly, it's because the book itself could have been much more informative. The lengthy notes on each drawing mostly just describe what you're already looking at; there's very little analysis. Aside from that, I'm puzzled at the comments of all the critics (and the other reviewers here) on Dr. Seuss's aparent &quot;racism&quot; in depicting the Japanese. This was wartime, folks! Of *course* there was anti-Japanese racism in the United States! Portraying the enemy in extremely uncomplimentary terms was part of the war effort. Remember the Warner Brothers theatrical cartoons? Remember the official U.S. government visual interpretations of the Japanese? Granted, it was stronger in the case of our Asian enemies because (1) there were relatively many fewer Japanese-Americans in 1942 than there were Americans of German and Italian descent, and (2) Asians simply stand out more prominently in a predominantly European country. Well, hindsight is a wonderful thing. And while it may be politically incorrect for me to point this out, it certainly doesn't make *me* racist to make the observation.	2001-06-27

Put John Grisham in knee breeches and a fullbottomed wig and he might have produced this very entertaining story of high finance and the law in early Georgian London. Benjamin Weaver, born Lienzo, is a Sephardic Jew long estranged from his family, an ex-pugilist (and highwayman and burglar and various other sordid occupations), and now a highly sought after &quot;thief-taker&quot; who seeks out debtors and stolen goods for a fee. The murder of his father, whom he had thought he hated, sets him in pursuit of an unknown killer -- but he finds himself quickly caught up in the complex and often bewildering affairs of the South Sea Company. The Company and the Bank of England are competitors for the enormously profitable business of servicing England's national debt, and the Company at least is apparently willing to go to some lengths to protect its potential profits. But Weaver also is given to violence to gain his ends and his enemies had just better watch out.<br />The plot is complicated but Liss, an expert-in-the-making on the subject of early 18th century English finance, explains things through his characters in a thoroughly informative way, from the ways in which an urban society functions in the absence of a police force, to the shift from &quot;hard&quot; money to fiat paper. His characters are, for the most part, realized in such great depth and with such believability that they take complete shape before the reader. Some of them -- especially his Uncle Miguel, the well-to-do goods merchant and importer, and Miriam, his late cousin's widow -- are marvelously done. So too is Abraham Mendes, fellow Jew and cold-blooded henchman to Jonathan Wild, the first modern crime czar. Liss also has a perceptive knack for approximating the idiom of the time and place without losing the reader. This novel is a very impressive debut.	2001-06-26

Ruby Lennox tells the story of her own life, beginning with the moment of her conception in 1951 in York, largest city in the north of England, moving agilely from near-slapstick to sly wit to very dark humor indeed. Alternating with the present-day chapters as Ruby gets older are chapter-length &quot;footnotes&quot; that examine the lives and parallel experiences of her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, and their siblings. In fact, there are numerous themes that develop here in parallel: What it means to be a mother, a sibling, a sister, what it means to leave everyone behind, what it means to grow up. An awful lot of people die in this book, but seldom in uninteresting ways, and often with a bit of waggish coincidence thrown in. Atkinson is very astute at portraying and developing her characters and possesses a nearly flawless sense of timing, although you may want to sketch out a pedigree chart to keep track of who's who and their relationships to everyone else; I had to keep turning back to check. The chapter on the Great War and its effects on the participants is especially moving. If you're thinking &quot;chick book,&quot; just forget the labels. When you finish it, it'll be weeks before you find anything else that seems equally worth reading. This is an extraordinary piece of work for a first novel.	2001-06-26

As noted before in my posted reviews, I'm a big fan of Varley's work. I first read this one, which is easily his best, when it first came out. In the near-decade since then, I had forgotten most of the details . . . which means it was time to re-read it and enjoy it all over again! The Invaders mopped up Earth in three days and went about their business -- think of it as spraying for termites -- and mankind is now limited to the eight worlds of our solar system to which we had already managed to spread. Now it's nearly the Bicentennial, and keeping Luna running and all its millions of inhabitants happy is the job of the Central Computer. And C.C. has done a pretty good job of it, too. No one messes with research in physics anymore, but the biological sciences have exploded to the point that changing your sex involves no more than a quick trip to a boutique. Everyone's body is loaded with nanobots (thanks to the Central Computer again), hardly anything is illegal, and the oldest Loonies are pushing three hundred years. And then C.C. begins to develop psychological problems. . . .  Varley's style is similar to Heinlein's -- but far better developed and much more &quot;literary&quot; -- and he also models himself on R.A.H. in spewing out original ideas and quirky thoughts on every page. This is a fat book, more than 560 pages, but trust me: You're going to wish there was more.	2001-06-26

The English are often a puzzlement to us Yanks, whether we're trying to do business over there or merely reading Dorothy Sayers over here. Smith, a novelist, short story writer, and columnist, has done a pretty good job at explaining various odd English-isms, such as kippers, the jug of ale vs. the straight glass, the six kinds of football, and the tendency to reply to &quot;Thank you,&quot; with another &quot;Thank you.&quot; He also supplies tidy little mini-essays on quintessential English writers such as Jane Austen, Anthony Burgess, Stephen Spender, and A. J. P. Taylor -- even when they're actually Irish, like George Bernard Shaw. Considering that this book was written seventeen years ago, some of his efforts haven't worn so well, especially the essays on each of the decades of the 20th century and almost every mention of the Labour Party and of Margaret Thatcher. Still, I've always wondered what the Cotswolds were. . . .	2001-06-26

I read a lot of books on writing techniques, character development, plotting, and all that sort of thing -- not because I expect to become Stephen King, and not even because I actually do some writing myself, but because I have an analytical turn of mind and I like to understand what's going on behind the scenes, in the author's mind. (I read screenplays for the same reason.) Some how-to books are much better than others, naturally, and King rather surprised me with this one. The man is not only a very talented writer, he's a very good teacher, too. On Writing is actually part writing manual and part semi-sardonic writer's autobiography. He describes how he grew up with the writing bug, how he got started and figured out what he wanted to do, how he actually learned how to do it . . . and how he sometimes screwed up. He certainly doesn't spare himself, either. King was an alcoholic and druggie for nearly two decades, but that apparently never got in the way of the creative process. Although &quot;There's one novel, CUJO, that I barely remember writing,&quot; he says. And several of the darker characters in such books as MISERY and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS were very much himself. He finally got rid of that baggage through his wife's firm intervention. King is a very generous person when he talks about other writers, though he doesn't hesitate to explain how and where even the best sometimes have a tin ear. His notion that a book is not created from nothing, that it's really a sort of fossil, to be excavated and exposed, is not entirely original with him, but he lays out his reasons very persuasively. Even though he taught high school English in his early career, he doesn't believe grammar should be seen as a straitjacket. And his books are almost entirely character-driven; he does almost no plotting in advance. (That's nice to hear because my mind works much the same way, but I feel guilty when I just let the story take off without having plotted and outlined it in advance.) The last section of the book talks about his near-fatal pedestrian encounter with a recklessly driven van in the summer of 1999 and the part that his return to the keyboard played in his continuing recuperation. Best of all, King writes nonfiction in much the same straightforward, unaffected way that he has produced more than forty bestselling novels.)

However,  things are getting really dicey lately, with the state legislature apparently about to institute massive faculty cuts, and the faculty union circling the wagons; a pox on both their houses, is Hank's attitude.

I acquired a copy of this book almost immediately after it was published, partly because I'm an avid fan of alternate histories and partly because I was an acquaintance of Bruce Sterling, one of the cofounders of cyberpunk. That is, I knew him to talk to because he was an Austinite and always came to ArmadilloCon, and he sort of knew who I was (though he made no pretense of remembering my name each year). He was pleased to sign my copy -- and changed the copyright date on the title page to 1855!<br /><br />And why do I especially like this book? It's the first instance I remember of what soon came to be known as &quot;steam-punk.&quot; A technology-based yarn, but with Victorian techno, not computers. Not exactly. There are three principal characters here: Sybil Gerard, daughter of Walter Gerard, the great Luddite agitator and orator; Dr. Edward Mallory, dinosaur-hunter, afficionado of steam-gurneys, and stalwart of the Industrial Radical Party; and Laurence Oliphant, who pretends to be only a somewhat adventuresome journalist-cum-diplomat but who is actually a top intelligence operative and handler for Her Majesty's government. And then there's Inspector Fraser, part of the very Special Branch, as well as a number of nicely realized supporting characters.<br /><br />But, of course, the story is really about the world of 1855 in which Charles Babbage was very successful in developing his mechanical computer, a marvelous Engine (always capitalized here) of wheels and rods and gears and punch cards that has put Britain well on top of things, and the government in many ways well on top of its citizens. The plot device that gets things going is the theft of a box of punched Engine cards, the purpose of which is never quite divulged -- though we know the program they contain is Important. It's all a great deal of fun in the Idea-as-Hero tradition. Gibson and Sterling (mostly the latter, I think) have definitely got the feel of the times and the city of London, immersing the reader in authentic jargon and cant, but without casting you adrift.<br /><br />Frankly, I don't understand the antipathy of the other reviewers. It's a pretty good story and most people I know personally, even those who aren't big Gibson fans, liked it. In fact, my only real complaint is in an area where Gibson's hand definitely shows, and that's the ending of the book. Actually, it doesn't really end; it just stops, and with a bit of Gibsonian mysticism regarding the set of cards thrown in.the reader in authentic jargon and cant, but without casting you adrift.<br /><br />Frankly, I don't understand the antipathy of the other reviewers.

Except for Martha Grimes, I don't usually go in for English mystery series, the sort of thing with continuing characters and starring a Scotland Yard investigator, nor have I read any others in this series. But I can see why this novel was voted a New York Times Notable Book of the Year and why it was nominated for both the Edgar and the Agatha.<br /> Detective Superintendent Duncan Kincaid has been divorced for twelve years, his life is ticking right along, and he has a nicely developing romance with his sergeant, Gemma James. And then he hears from his ex-wife, Victoria, now a professor of modern English poetry at Cambridge, who has been researching a biography of Lydia Brooke, who died in what Victoria has come to believe are suspicious circumstances a few years before. She wants Duncan's help, and he agrees, to Gemma's consternation. Sounds like a pretty routine plot, doesn't it? It's not, believe me. Where most writers in this genre concentrate on the plot, with characters who are less than three-dimensional, or (again, like Martha Grimes) develop wonderful characters but tend to stint the mystery itself, Crombie succeeds very well at both. Duncan and Gemma and Victoria all come alive, as do the supporting players, and you won't guess at the solution to the mystery until the denouement, either. By the end of the book, Duncan's life has become permanently more complicated, and I want to know what happens next!

Keller thinks about what he does for a living; in the first book, he even goes into analysis for awhile (which is spectacularly unsuccessful).

This one is perhaps even stranger than 'The Ax'. This time, we're dealing with two New York novelists: Bryce Proctorr (why the double-R?), a very successful A-list writer with a multi-million-dollar contract and a summer place in Connecticut, and Wayne Prentice, a fading author who's running out of pseudonyms and whom the marketing computers have consigned to Purgatory. They were acquainted in the old days, and now they happen to meet again, doing research at the library. And Bryce confesses that he's been blocked on his current novel since his particularly nasty divorce began, largely because his not-yet-ex will get fifty percent of the $1.1 million he'll receive for the finished book. Wayne, on the other hand, has a perfectly good completed novel at home that he can't sell. So, . . . what if Bryce were to take that unsold manuscript, rework it little (to make it his own work, sort of), and send it in under his own name? And pay Wayne half of that $1.1 million? Wayne has been getting more and more desperate -- not just because he needs the money (which he does) but because he's a NOVELIST, and this is what he DOES. The only problem is, if Wayne gets half the book money, and Bryce's wife gets the other half, that doesn't leave much for Bryce. So, . . . the wife will have to go, right? Can Wayne handle that part? I won't give away the story any farther, except to say that the twists and turns in the plot, and in the two men's lives, are cunningly fashioned and delightfully Hitchcockian. How great is the price one should be willing, or at least able, to pay for success? The ending is rather abrupt ? but, then, the ENDING is rather abrupt.

But I remembered enjoying it a great deal, so I set out to find it again, and Inter-Library Loan came through. (They usually do.) It's only 250 pages, a pretty fast read -- and now I know why it had stuck with me all these years.<br /> Brian Chaney is an epigrapher in Hebrew and Aramaic documents, translator of a recently discovered scroll at Qumran which has upset a lot of people. He's also a demographer and futurist and has written a report for the government laying out probable trends for the near future. (The story begins in 1978, which was also the near future for Tucker, who feared the repressive trends he himself observed in the late Sixties.) Chaney gets drafted for a secret project run by the Bureau of Weights and Measures (a nice touch), which has managed to build a forward-traveling time machine. He and his two colleagues -- a no-nonsense Army major and a freewheeling Navy commander -- will journey to the end of the 20th century to see if those trends have panned out, to bring back information to allow the government of 1978 to lay its plans to deal with future problems. But the President, naturally, sets the target of the preliminary field trial at 1980; he wants to know whether he's going to be reelected. Oh, yes, the politicians will never hesitate to take over science for their own ends, and Tucker knows it. Then there's Katherine Van Hise, known as &quot;Katrina,&quot; who is more or less the managing director of the project at the local level. Chaney is very attacted to her, and so is Commander Saltus. And so they make their jumps, singly and one at a time, to 1999 and to 2000 and to sometime in the 2020s (I think) . . . and nothing is as they thought it would be.<br /> This is an intimate drama of Armageddon in Illinois, a reduction of global catastrophe to manageable proportions. The style is quiet and perfectly straightforward, the imagery is both subtle and apocalyptic. And the three time travelers -- and Katrina -- will turn out to be unexpected heroes.<br /> Arthur Wilson Tucker, known throughout science fiction fandom as &quot;Bob,&quot; was not a scientist like Asimov or Benford. He was, in fact, a motion picture projectionist from Illinois who wrote mysteries and science fiction stories and novels on the side, beginning in 1941. This book and 'The Lincoln Hunters' are certainly his best (and best known) work, but there was another whole side to him -- the raconteur and noted wit who hung out with the &quot;ordinary&quot; fans at WorldCons, and who held forth at hotel room parties on the benefits of bourbon (&quot;Smoooooth!&quot;), and who cheerfully distributed business cards with only his name on one side and the words &quot;Natural Inseminations&quot; on the reverse. (I still have my card from MidAmericon in 1976.) The fans loved him and he loved them. In fact, Bob Tucker was the first Fan Guest of Honor at a WorldCon (Torcon in 1948).

And the three time travelers -- and Katrina -- will turn out to be unexpected heroes.<br /> Arthur Wilson Tucker, known throughout science fiction fandom as &quot;Bob,&quot; was not a scientist like Asimov or Benford. He was, in fact, a motion picture projectionist from Illinois who wrote mysteries and science fiction stories and novels on the side, beginning in 1941. This book and 'The Lincoln Hunters' are certainly his best (and best known) work, but there was another whole side to him -- the raconteur and noted wit who hung out with the &quot;ordinary&quot; fans at WorldCons, and who held forth at hotel room parties on the benefits of bourbon (&quot;Smoooooth!&quot;), and who cheerfully distributed business cards with only his name on one side and the words &quot;Natural Inseminations&quot; on the reverse. (I still have my card from MidAmericon in 1976.) The fans loved him and he loved them. In fact, Bob Tucker was the first Fan Guest of Honor at a WorldCon (Torcon in 1948).

I've never been a big fan of Abraham Lincoln, a result of reading too much real history, probably. Vidal makes Old Abe interesting -- fascinating, in fact -- but I can't say I like him any the better. He was never any kind of abolitionist, of course, which was why the Radical Republicans didn't like him. He &quot;freed the slaves&quot; only by &quot;military necessity,&quot; and then only in the areas the North didn't even control. And he insisted, right up until the day before his assassination, that all negroes in the United States should be loaded onto ships and resettled in Central America, whether they wanted to go or not. Lincoln went into the war only to keep the Union together by force (which was certainly unconstitutional), but he had little or no regard for the Constitution anyway, suspending the right of habeus corpus, shutting down newspapers and arresting editors who didn't agree with his administration, and censoring publications of all kinds before the fact.<br /> However, compared to the conniving of Salmon Chase (who wanted to be president but settled for Chief Justice), the arrogance of Edwin Stanton (who threw Mrs. Lincoln out of the room where the president was dying), the jingoism of William Seward (who wanted to start a war with England, France and Spain so the U.S. could take over the entire Western Hemisphere -- which, he was sure, would also bring the South back into the fold), and the long string of absoltuely disasterous generals with which the North was saddled, Lincoln was almost an innocent. The most likeable character in the book is the young John Hay, Lincoln's second secretary (and destined to become McKinley's Secretary of State), who has a refreshingly unbuttoned attitude toward almost everyone and everything. And Mary Todd Lincoln, the only real abolitionist in the family, is a fascinating person, as Vidal portrays her descent from extreme migraine into paranoia and schizophrenia.<br /> So Vidal has done it again, and I would strongly recommend this book to anyone with the slightest interest in history. He invents almost nothing, but with this gang of political cut-throats, he doesn't need to!ngly recommend this book to anyone with the slightest interest in history. He invents almost nothing, but with this gang of political cut-throats, he doesn't need to!	2001-01-30

Every writer looks around his workplace sometimes and wonders what other writers' desks look like. It's almost a prurient interest. Krementz, who is married to Kurt Vonnegut and is a leading photojournalist, has photographed more than 1,500 writers at work in the past thirty years. This splendid slender book brings together photos of fifty-three authors in their habitats, from Pablo Neruda and Archibald MacLeish to Stephen King and Edwidge Dandicat. Each photo is accompanied by each author's thoughts on desks, typewriters, and writing methods and times of day. This is the sort of book you'll pick up over and over again, examining the clutter on James Merrill's desk, or wondering if you should try writing in bed, like Walker Percy or Cathleen Schine. Highly recommended.	2000-11-29

Except for Grafton's &quot;alphabet&quot; series and Joe Gores's D.K.A. novels, I'm not an especially devoted reader of mysteries. I've read a few of Westlake's decidedly odd yarns in the past, though, so I decided to believe the rave reviews of this one. And I'm glad I did, because it's terrific. Burke Devore is a decent guy, a 50-year-old middle manager in charge of a specialized assembly line at a paper mill in Connecticut, who gets (as he puts it) &quot;chopped&quot; by the latest round of downsizing and consolidation in his industry. There are a lot of guys with his job description out of work all at once. And he knows that, although he's very good at his job, he's not the best available. After two years of belt-tightening unemployment, of job interviews followed by nothing but silence, Burke is coming to the end of his rope. Then, while keeping up with the comings and goings in his field -- can't let your industry leave you behind, you know! -- he reads an intereview with another manager in another mill nearby, and he knows *that's* the job he wants, the job he *should* have, the job he's entitled to in order to take care of his family. But what to do about all those other unemployed managers? What about the competition? How can he make sure *he* is the best available candidate when &quot;his&quot; job opens up? Well, he's a manager, right? He can manage this. All the time I was reading this ghastly, funny, satirical, terrifying, and very entertaining book, I was thinking what a first-rate movie it could be. I'd pick John Lithgow for the role of Burke.	2000-11-29

Sakamoto Chiyo is the daughter of a poor fisherman. Her mother is dying from cancer and neither Chiyo nor her sister have much of a future -- though, of course, it doesn't seem that way to her. But it's 1929 (she's nine years old), and things are about to get much, much harder. Partly for his own (unstated) reasons, partly to rescue his two daughters while he still can, their father sends both girls off to Kyoto to be apprenticed into the geisha trade. Actually, he sells them -- they &quot;belong&quot; to their new mistresses -- but it takes a little while for the reader to realize that. Satsu, the older sister, doesn't meet the requirements and becomes, for awhile, a prostitute, until she manages to run away and essentially disappears from the story, except in Chiyo's mind. But Chiyo herself becomes a maid -- sort of a pre-trainee -- in the okiya of Mother and Auntie, and though she loathes the life, and the loss of her home, and expects nothing good of her own future, she adapts rather quickly. Over the ensuing years, she becomes first an apprentice, then a full geisha, and the story of her training, her growing understanding of her world -- the limits of the geisha-world of the Gion district of Kyoto -- and her understanding and misunderstanding of men makes up the first three-quarters of the book. Golden, a Westerner, nevertheless has considerable experience in and understanding of Japan and the social institutions peculiar to its recent past. He puts you there, looking over Chiyo's shoulder as she attends lessons in flute, shamisen, dance, and tea ceremony, as her name changes to Nitta Sayuri when she becomes a geisha and is adopted as the &quot;daughter&quot; of the okiya, as she learns from her &quot;older sister,&quot; Mameha, and suffers under the thumb of Hatsumomo, the senior geisha of her okiya, and as she forms her lifelong attachment to the Chairman and to the one-armed Nobu-san. Chiyo/Sayuri is a strange (to us) combination of worldliness and sophistication on the one hand and utter naivete and ignorance on the other, as was apparently typical for geisha. She has no idea whether a pound of tea costs more than a broom, but she shows astute knowledge of the history and art of every kimono among the thousands she wears in her young life. And, of course, just as she's nearing adulthood, World War II brings its full weight down upon the ordinary people of Japan, including the geisha. I can't recommend this novel too highly. It also proves once again that Knopf continues to be the premier publisher of high-quality fiction in this country.hairman and to the one-armed Nobu-san.

This 500-page romp is one of the best sf books I've read by any author in the past couple of years. Set in the same post-Invasion universe as many of his other works, this is the story of Kenneth Catherine Valentine, known to his generation as &quot;Sparky,&quot; and the scion of a multi-generational acting family. His domineering father, John Barrymore Valentine, possesses a towering talent and an ego to match, plus a rather mis-formed personality, which has warped Sparky in its own way. Now nearing the age of 100, the younger Valentine has spent several decades doing legitimate theater in the Outer Planets, between bouts of Punch-and-Judy performances and running cons to keep the wolf from the door. But now he has the opportunity to do Lear -- the pinacle role for a Shakespearian actor. Getting back to Luna in one piece is another question, though. In many ways, in his discursive, almost argumentative style of writing and in the multitude of ideas he spins out in the course of the story, Varley is the natural heir of Robert Heinlein. And any committed Heinlein fan is certain to like this book.	2000-11-29

One of the usually less successful types of science fiction story (in my opinion) is the &quot;secret history&quot; story, in which the plot turns on events that most of us don't know about -- things we aren't *supposed* to know about, secret things that allow some individual or group to (usually) rule the world. Generally, the key events or relationships that give the secret group its power are a little too pat, a little too coincidental, and the stories usually are not believable. Asimov's Foundation trilogy was an exception, up to a point, and so was Wilson &amp; Shea's Illuminati triology. And now, so is this novel.<br /> The early 19th century was a time of amateur gentleman scholars who thought that if you could only gather enough information, enough data, about people and society at large, you could work out policies that would improve everyone's lot in life. According to Flynn, a small group of those do-gooders in New England (1) managed to develop a mathematical approach to social engineering, (2) got Babbage's engine to work, and (3) began to do something about the state of the world. And they've been at it ever since. Only, they're really not very good at it.<br /> Flynn has a real knack for the language and he seems to know his history. The &quot;fulcra&quot; he selects, the points where a small change might tip the course of events in quite a different direction, are quite reasonable, and he'll tell you exactly why. The characters are believable and three-dimensional and often sympathetic, even the bad guys. And coincidence is kept to a minimum. There's lots of juicy quotes in this one, too. This book was recommended to me by a friend several years ago, but I've only just gotten around to reading it -- and now I have to go see what else Flynn has written!	2000-11-29

This is the first book I've read by this author, having had him recommended to me by several friends, and I wish I hadn't waited so long. His plotting is complex but understandable (if you pay attention), his characters are very true-to-life, and the action is nicely-paced. In this case, it's a serial killer (sort of), a lady lawyer who becomes his attorney (without at first knowing what he is), a D.A. who tries too hard, and a governor about to be confirmed to the Supreme Court with a secret in his political past. This would probably make a terrific movie, but I don't know what you could cut to get it down to size. I'm definitely going to be reading more of Margolin.	2000-11-29

I have a feeling the previous reviewers were expecting a how-to book of home construction projects. Actually this is more of a tour guide. It's fascinating to discover the many creative, ingenious, and very original ways architects and ordinary booklovers have found to store books, display them, and enjoy being in their presence. Face it -- one never has enough bookshelves. And some of these homes are definitely masquerading as libraries! Here are bookshelves up under the eaves of an older house, or installed over the doorways in the hall, or built into closets and cupboards and under kitchen counters. Others are freestanding on metal shelves and poles and rigged like a ship's masts. There are small libraries built into the landings of staircases and others that cover entire walls of bedrooms. Some are two tiers deep, with the front one moving sideways on rollers. Others share space with lamps, TV sets, telephones, clocks, computers, ancient artifacts, photographs, and knick-knacks. And the one thing all the arrangements depicted in this book have in common is, none of them -- even the most attractively arranged -- are just for show. One look at the worn covers and frayed jackets tells you these books are the constant companions of their owners.	2000-11-29

Vidal is no fan of organized religion of any stripe, but he especially dislikes the authoritarian history of Christianity down through the centuries. The Emperor Julian, called &quot;the Apostate&quot; by the followers of the Gallilean, was the grandson of Constantine and the nephew of Constans. He was a philospher by nature but also a natural military genius who took back Gaul from the Germanic tribes. Most important, Julian was a convinced Hellenist and when he finally came to power, he made a serious effort to enforce religious tolerance in the empire -- something the Christian bishops certainly didn't want, and still don't! Unfortunately, he reigned for only four years and was killed (probably murdered at the instigation of the bishops) on campaign in Persia. And that was the last chance the ancient world had. After Julian's death, the Church was firmly in charge and stayed that way. Vidal's polemical style is always enjoyable, but especially so in this case, with Julian pointing out to his politico-religious enemies the many ways in which they don't practice what they preach. Vidal doesn't invent any history here; in fact, he hews more closely to the provable facts than most &quot;Christian&quot; histories of the classical era. So why is this book out of print?!	2000-11-29

I like to play &quot;what if&quot; myself, but writing something that succeeds both as fiction and as plusible alternate history is really tough. Among themes, having the Germans win WWII is a close second to the South winning the Civil War, and virtually all the stories in this excellent collection succeed admirably. Some I've read before, like &quot;Weihnactsabend&quot; by Keith Roberts and Brad Linaweaver's excellent &quot;Moon of Ice,&quot; but others were apparently written especially for this volume, including the terrific &quot;Thor Meets Captain America&quot; by David Brin.

This is one of those books that's been on my &quot;to read&quot; list forever, but I've only just gotten around to it -- mostly because another writer said Cornwell remade one section of the mystery genre with this book. And I can see how she did that. This is the first of what has become a long series of novels featuring Virginia Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta, who has not just a tense and trying professional life but a stack of personal problems that somewhat overlap with it, especially in the matter of her ten-year-old, too-bright niece. She's a very believable protagonist. More than that, this is a serial killer story written right on the edge -- very realistic, very gritty, and pretty nerve-wracking. I had to stay up late one night to finish the book!<br /> And that's where my only complaint comes in, too. I had considered all the characters, trying to figure out whodunit, and I could make a case for several of them -- but each of them also had (or seemed to have) an alibi or a counterbalancing reason to assume their innocence. And I was anxious to see how the author wrapped everything up. Well, . . . I won't give away the ending, but I will say I was rather annoyed. I really don't think she played fair with the reader. However, given the high reputation of this series, I'll have to have a go at a couple of others and see what happens. Cornwell is an excellent narrator and a talented user of the language, so I'll give her another chance.	2000-11-29

I know something about the far Northwest and I have several longtime Japanese-American friends, and this story is true to the cadence and nuances of both, alternating between the quiet dignity of the strawberry farmers (even in the love scenes) and the hard-edged instincts of the fishermen.<br />I finished this amazing book a month ago and have read two other novels since... yet scenes and bits of dialogue and descriptions of the island keep wafting back into my mind.<br />I can't recommend it highly enough.	1998-06-10

I needn't have hesitated -- it's a hoot and a half! Some of the characters are types (like Bob Carlson and the university president in his mint-green shirts), but no less valid for all that. Others are shrewdly original and it's fascinating to watch them develop -- especially Dr. Lionel Gift, whose approach to economics is Darwinian, and Timothy Monahan, novelist/professor, who struggles with proto-writers during the school year and works the writers' conference circuit in the summer. Chaiman X, the incendiary horticulturalist, is my other favorite; I knew a couple like him. Wait! Can I have more favorites? Like Mrs. Walker, the secret power behind practically everything, and Earl Butz, gourmand extraordinaire and a helluva swell hog, and...<br /> From the other posted reviews, I suspect Big City-types aren't going to entirely understand or appreciate this book, but if you spent any amount of time around a university that had &quot;agricultural&quot; in its name, you really ought to give this one a try.	1998-03-06
