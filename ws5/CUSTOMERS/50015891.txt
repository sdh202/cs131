Therefore the federal government will then-step in and sanction those same schools for their 'failure', and perhaps create a backdoor to privatization.<br /><br />In the process, NCLB comes down the hardest on some of the same groups who had actually hailed it's passage in the attempt to equalize educational quality. The civil rights groups hailing the law had good intentions, but they did not scrutinize how the law ultimately would evolve during implementation.<br /><br />America's decentralized education funding system (p.6) increases the chasm which students and their schools are expected to cross to recieve a 'good' education. We continue giving different groups of kids different quality resources and then seriously expect them to have exactly identical results. Consequently, the implemented law now stresses educational equality of testing results--which in turn, supposedly judges if a child is 'smart'.<br /><br />Everything being tied to the results of one test places a significant amount of pressure upon anybody. I can only imagine what it psychologically does to a public school student who has honestly tried the best they could--and might have even loved to learn.<br /><br />The federal government insists that all children can process information in the same exact manner--those who cannot will be penalized for their 'difference'. This itself is an excuse to undermine special education and that program's emphasis on 'individualized education plans' for eligible students. For that matter, it also attacks bilingual education and other programs which have recognized that the nation's students are not little robots in training.<br /><br />With emphasis on rote memorization, another criticism of this law is that it dumbs down the United States public education system. Because the poorest school districts are having to allocate what monies they do have to the testing program, they cannot teach their students the critical thinking skills which would help them attend college. Only the richest (and not incidentally whitest) school districts in America would be able to steer their students towards a college track--provided those students were even encouraged to stay in the school.<br /><br />While schools cannot openly exclude the neediest populations anymore, I am concerned that these student groups could be pushed out in order for a school to improve it's test score ranking--and avoid receiving federal sanctions. Never mind if that student is actually attempting to learn in the classroom. Never mind if that student has a perfect GPA and successfully performs 'college prep' work.<br /><br />I also appreciate that this work has ideas for overhauling that same law. Identifying a problem is empowering, but eliminating it enables people to make real change in their communities. This is an important book for educators, public officials, parents, community activists, and/or the students affected by NCLB. It provides critical 'education' about the realities of early 21st Century public school policy.ve recognized that the nation's students are not little robots in training.  <br /> <br />With emphasis on rote memorization, another criticism of this law is that it dumbs down the United States public education system.

Sure I've heard the Village People's infamous song many times over, but I had not previously imagined how complex these relationships were---or explored all reasons for the \\"Y\\"'s comparative decline as a homosocial/homosexual cruising site.<br /><br />Allegedly to avoid clogging the swimming pools with their cotton swim suits, many men at the \\"Y\\" simply elected to swim nude. Not attaching anything sexual to the action, both the men and the organization accepted it as a matter of fact that men would see each other naked at the \\"Y\\".<br /><br />The tension between people who wanted to keep things as they were and those who wanted the organization to project a 'family image' (hence the designation of \\"Family Y's\\" in post-war America) rivals any dramatic work which I've seen thus far. Considering the 'intense relationships' which they formed as consequence of working in the 'Y' movement, I also found it odd that some people in the YMCA would accuse their counterparts in the Young Women's Christian Association of being lesbians. These men had apparently absorbed the double-standards of their own day which negated women's public sphere influence.<br /><br />The admission of women as members into the previously all-male realm of the Y was also interesting. This move was another tactic to convince people---inside and outside the organization---nothing improper was happening. During it's history, the organization also faced criticisms of it's program.<br /><br />In 1912, the Portland, Oregon YMCA, with the ninth largest membership in North America, became the center of a sex scandal. A Portland newspaper charged many of the city's most prominent men with sodomy and delinquency of minors. A few of the implicated men lived at the YMCA and others used the sports facilities. This was the first time that a connection between the YMCA and homosexuality was publicly made.<br /><br />The organization continued struggling with the issue of homosexuality, but their 'front lines'--the desk clerks allegedly supposed to guard against homosexuality---looked the other way. In this closeted era, the YMCA was a critical meeting space for 'queer' young men.<br /><br />For all of the critical perspective, the book does praise it's subject. The \\"Y\\" pioneered racial unity AND sex education in an era when even many secular organizations lacked courage to even consider taking on the issue. I was especially heartened by the advocay of factually-based sex education, myself living in an era when so many other organizations with 'Christian' in their name actually advocate that people not have access to any of this information. How refreshing to read of an alternative---and in a much earlier era too!<br /><br />This book is part of the Chicago series on Sexuality, History and Society, but people wanting to read about YMCA history would also find it interesting because the authors have used very inclusive and broad 19th century framework to explore intimate relationships among men. Finally, it would be a good acquisition for people who are just interested in American history period, however altered from it's founding, the \\"Y\\" still exists as an institution and continues to promote racial justice and sex education.

This book is a tribute to the late Senator Paul Wellstone (D MN) and his wife Shelia, who died in a plane accident. Before his untimely demise, Wellstone was one of the most dynamic examples that liberalism was not dead in the Democratic Party and was not dead in America either.<br /><br />I loved his floor speeches and sponsored legislation because they intentionally sought an America where people truly were united. He believed in and genuinely loved the American people.<br /><br />This book, influenced by the workshop series Mark and David Wellstone started to honor their parents, explains how everybody and anybody can become a more effective progressive activist. The best cause in the world looses visibility when organizers cannot get their message out to the public or even figure out how to field organize.<br /><br />Since even experienced activists can become overwhelmed with all of the tasks we need to do in tight races, having the basic steps laid out was also helpful for us.  Another major strength of the book is that it is for novice politicos and veteran organizers alike. The more, the merrier!<br /><br />Most of all, this book stresses the Wellstone way was and is connecting with people. The right only holds seats because their candidates spin to 'common people' but we do not have to put on such false airs. We can represent the common people because we are them.	2005-10-10

One of the actors in that movement was lawyers.<br /><br />Because they were not necessarily on welfare themselves, they had various motives for helping the welfare rights movement. Some people truly were empathetic to the cause; other people were going through the motions of their work. There also was a gendered component because the 'heads of households' on welfare were women and the lawyers (in an era when law school quotas were active) were predominantely men. How could they possibly empathize with the personal life experiences of their clients even if 'public aid' lawyers did not have to worry where their next meal was comming from?<br /><br />However, this book emphasizes that all lawyers reconfigured the 'welfare recipient'. From factors including their involvement she was an assertive-aggressive being who was demanding her rights publicly, This was far cry from the depression era woman intentionally positioned by society as meek and subservient, grateful for whatever assistance she did receive.<br /><br />Eight years after 'welfare reform', this book was an important read. It provides critical insight for readers interested in public policy and human services. It is also important reading for anybody needing to understand how the motives of a policy advocate ultimately do shape a public policy.	2005-10-10

While `other' people toiled away in minimum wage positions, we were being assured job security and lots of perks to boot. College graduates were guaranteed a place in that company until their retirement from the company. They had made it in the world---or so they thought.<br /><br />Economic realities are delivering an abrupt wake-up call.<br /><br />In American society, making a profit is the bottom line of any corporation. This pursuit has recently led to layoff of white-collar workers in record numbers. The `downsized' workers had not done anything wrong except for being on the company payroll when it was trying to cut every corner imaginable.<br /><br />Now many of the same workers who had assumed they would not need or even supported policies which attacked social services are finding themselves having to use them. It is disorienting for these people to recognize they need to apply for public assistance and other programs which were once presumed to exist for `lazy freeloaders'. They are quickly trying to return to the White Collar world, but finding those jobs are much easier said than done.<br /><br />Smelling blood in the water, a veritable cottage industry of consultants and agencies opened up to theoretically help the newly-unemployed regain their corporate footing. Ehrenreich says theoretically because otherwise then those companies themselves would be out of their jobs. Therefore, they systematically keep clients just hopeful enough that `only' if they do the right things will they be able to get a job. The all-critical catch is the seminar trainees are rarely able to do things as well as the trainer admonishes them to.  This bittersweet cycle is punctuated by the ever-perky organization staffs.<br /><br />I read this book while my own father and his peers are among many of those whose experiences are being described through the text. She never interviewed them, but Ehrenreich's words echo their experiences.  Who you know and then what those people can do for you is often more important to present-day job hunts than your prior education and/or job experiences combined. Finding a job occurs more through personal connection (the `friend of a friend' avenue) than employment agencies or even reading the `classifieds' section of your local newspaper.<br /><br />The college transcript has decreased in importance, even though they are still used to some extent in order to screen job candidates in some cases. However, the book also expertly captures the paradoxical frustrations which many people-supposed to be America's `elite' are instead feeling. If they really had made it in American society, why do they have to look so thoroughly for any job (never mind the `dream') and worry about basic subsistence?<br /><br />In these respects, Ehrenreich's book is a logical extension of \\"Nickeled and Dimed\\". It illustrates that current American socioeconomic policies hurt most people and we will very soon be a nation of the very wealthy 5-10% while the majority will end up living in abject poverty despite our education, our skills, and/or work ethic.<br /><br />America's current national unemployment policies almost exclusively reference the working class because America does not want to admit that such a large percentage of its white collar workforce is vulnerable to being laid off. Pretending that downsizing only happens to `other' people in an already highly competitive economic class is much easier than admitting the system itself is long overdue for overhaul.<br /><br />Ehrenreich is a powerful writer specifically because she transforms `abstract' economic concepts into human interest stories---which connect with the readers. Her books are ultimately uplifting because while documenting current problems, she also foreshadows an America where those very problems are solved.  I'd recommend this book for public and college libraries. It is also an excellent comfort book for the white-collar worker and/or their families who are facing the circumstances described in this book.families who are facing the circumstances described in this book.	2005-10-09

Reich then concludes that liberalism is the American tradition and thus is still beneficial for the country. Furthermore, he argues that a majority of the people are in fact liberals.<br /><br />It is the centrism and waffling among some Democrats which ironically confuses people about what liberalism is and who liberals are. Those actions prevent the voters from seeing that liberals are in fact human beings and they themselves are among the group.<br /><br /> The 'waffling' undertaken to reach 'swing voters' subsequently prompts a larger segment of voters to go to Radcons--even though those people are themselves the classic lions in sheep's clothing.  Radcons are only interested in getting and maintaining power over other people at all costs, they really don't give a flip about the common person.<br /><br />Reich's words are inspiring in these times. Specifically because this man does believe in America, he wants us to go beyond sound bites and have America's actions demonstrate how great it is. We could save time and money on 'image consulting' if we remembered that other countries (especially in the computer/e-news era) look at our actions much more closely than the image make over of the second.<br /><br />Reich's book is a thoughtful and articulate work. It needs to be in everybody's collection.	2005-10-06

Organizing wasn't an 'extra' for these women; it was their means of survival in a cruel system which wasn't necessarily prepared for them.<br /><br />When welfare was initially set up in the 1930's, racial segregation kept the welfare rolls white. Politicians and taxpayers had an unspoken agreement that welfare was being set up so white women without their husbands could still be a full-time stay at home mother in the prescribed notions of the day.<br /><br />Integration of government programs in the 1960's subsequently transformed the recipients into the 'undeserving poor' who WERE supposed to be outside of the home and working despite having young children. Suddenly government officials began referencing the 'welfare queen' in both allusions and direct references to black women, even if a majority of the welfare recipients remained white.<br /><br />The emergent new right quickly learned that the mere specter of black women reproducing frightened enough voters to swing elections. Welfare influenced elections and public policies through a subtly constructed 'law and order' appeal where direct appeals to segregation were failing. Voters were convinced 'they' were getting rich off of having babies.<br /><br />Thus as the government's own minimum cost of living dramatically rose during the 1970's, the actual purchasing power of the monthly payments further decreased to absurdly unworkable levels. Welfare rights organizers such as Johnnie Tilmon pointed out the impossibility of any human attempting to live on those amounts of money, never mind 'comfortably'.<br /><br />They also emphasized that women on welfare were consequently subjected to purchasing the most run down materials and the most spoiled foods in their communities with the money which they did receive. Hardly living large off of the system, such conditions fueled their organizing anger.<br /><br />The welfare rights movement also protested punitive raids on recipient homes. Attempting to see if a man was illegally staying in the home, these raids removed autonomy from the recipients. People on welfare were not considered adults, but alternately children and social menaces.<br /><br />Nadasen includes some information on `ending welfare as we know it' in 1996. However, the bulk of her book is a case study of the 1970's welfare rights movement as a political force for and by poor women. Against less than ideal circumstances and token support from other feminists/women activists, how did these women accomplish what they did when they did? What did their idea of a 'just world' look like?<br /><br />This multi-dimensional book also examines the bureaucratic contradictions of the National Welfare Rights Organization. NWRO was a national organization which was supposed to help these women help themselves and each other, but it was run by white middle-class men. Although the men professed to be empathetic to the cause, the women recognized a contradiction.<br /><br />As a consequence of their own organizing, the women came to see themselves as empowered---but from a different construct of \\"liberation\\" than one being used by White and/or middle-class groups. For women on welfare, having the right to stay at home and take care of their children was no less disempowering a choice than other women choosing to work outside the home--again because the individual was making a choice over the direction of her own life.<br /><br />This book is essential for women's studies scholars. It is also a good purchasefor social science professionals, particularly social workers.	2005-10-05

Their family attempted to secure the benefits which are being guaranteed to other monogamous couples only because we are straight--and they are not.<br /><br />Savage knows where he and his family stand under the law. Yet, this writing style works when and how it does precisely because Savage does not loose any audience through academic jargon.<br /><br />His fluid and honest text works because it provides facts about how these policies are adversely hurting real families. He wants the largest number of people possible to recognize their own stake in the issue, pick up a copy of the book, and immediately understand it.<br /><br />While Savage is explaining things to his son, I practically started crying. Yes, invoking kids with causes (either for or against) is a 'traditional' appeal, but none of the self-appointed family protectors railing against same sex marriage is apparently concerned with what knowing that his family is being discriminated against will do to this boy.<br /><br />I honestly believe that same-sex marriage restrictions stand to damage Savage's son much more than having monogamous and committed parents who just happen to be gay.<br /><br />This book is a good read for people working in the trenches against horribly misnamed 'pro-family' marriage amendments and also those people who are uncomfortable with same sex marriage bans but do not feel they know enough about the issue to be 'activist'.	2005-10-05

Bush presidential administration: 'faith-based initiatives'.<br /><br />During the 2000 presidential campaign, in an effort to (particularly) win votes from religious conservatives and economic conservatives, then-Texas Governor George W. Bush argued that the government could save it's money by contracting with religious institutions to provide social services.<br /><br />Using scholarly data, the authors examined how a legislative objective is first proposed but can then be subsequently altered by many other factors.<br /><br />With terrorism and Iraq the administration's new buzz words, does the White House Office for Religious Initiatives and Outreach even have enough money and resources to implement its related policies as the supporters of this project had initially envisioned?<br /><br />In government, having appropriate funding levels for a project and/or office is everything. An idea sounding initially good and workable can subsequently morph into a veritable nightmare (and become cited by the public as 'government failure') when it lacks enough implementation resources.<br /><br />Such an environment is ironically what supporters of the faith-based initiatives have cited as their evidence for the 'practical' successes of faith-based social services.<br /><br />However some opponents (including religious clergy themselves) have argued back that religious institutions becoming entangled in the government's economic environment means that churches then loose the specific reason why their own programs had worked in the past sans the government partnership. Becoming subject to the same forms of bureaucracy, these organizations then cannot work exactly as they had in the past.	2005-10-05

Even without Joe McCarthy screaming about a 'list', we have a similar climate of fear and division. Ironically the current silence might even be masking a more dangerous environment.<br /><br />Ed Asner, a recognized 'Hollywood liberal' would certainly be expected to be a 'celebrity writer' of this kind of book.His name has been connected to many progressive causes since the 1970's.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised by Burt Hall's contribution. Although he concedes to having voted for John McCain (who despite his 'independence' still belongs to a party which attacks women, gays, and the environment under 'national security'), Hall's bureaucratic background ultimately gives the book enough credibility with swing readers.<br /><br />These swing readers are themselves not dedicated liberals but are also bothered by the far right's agenda. They want to know that they are not the only ones who oppose the far right.<br /><br />Both authors are articulate, proactive, and encouraging. They believe that being aware of and getting involved in government is an activity which anybody can do. They believe that citizen participation is something which anybody should do. They want their readers to know that they are also capable of becoming involved.<br /><br />Using their own real-life examples, Hall and Asner show simple and effective ways which people have made their will known to the government. Both authors sincerely believe that the government needs to be accountable to all citizens at all times. There should not be any compromise on this.	2005-10-04

It is maddening to believe there were people in Washington who actually considered such treatment of kids to be 'good policy'.<br /><br />While reading through this book, I was gennuinely driven to tears. The tactics which were used on the kids were what was 'savage'. Ethnocentrism and racism kept the United States government and its representatives from seeing the Indians as a civilized and advanced society.<br /><br />The primary and secondary sources which David Wallace Adams cites emphasize that the 'pupils' were not naive and passive victims of these abuses. Predating the American Indian Movement of the 1960's and 1970's, they resisted the 'education' which these schools were trying to shove down their own throats.	2005-10-01

Critchlow, the ever-prolific professor of policy studies has performed a daunting task. In this book, he wrote a critical but balanced biography of Phyllis Schlafly.<br /><br />Schlafly is the female new right activist who claims sole responsibility for defeating the Equal Rights Amendment in 1982. Previous biographies about her were blatantly partisan projects because their authors either attacked or fawned over their subject. The long-time far right activist engenders strong feelings among people familiar with her work; you either love or hate her.<br /><br />Phyllis Schlafly first appeared in national politics in 1964. That year, she wrote `A choice: Not an echo' which tried to explain why Goldwater was the `sensible' choice. Yet, because Johnson then-rode public sympathy over the Kennedy assassination, he won a landslide and she temporarily receded from public view. After fallout with the National Federation of Republican Women, she formed her own women's organization, the Eagle Forum.<br /><br />The Eagle Forum's veritable heyday came in the late 1970's/early 1980's when Schlafly came back onto the national stage. She became the New Right's favorite speaker against feminism/`Women's Lib'. Although Schlafly herself was a Harvard-trained lawyer and accomplished political activist, she instead emphasized that she was `just a housewife' who genuinely enjoyed mothering six kids. Schlafly consequently allowed the male conservatives to oppose ERA ratification efforts without themselves appearing sexist; `They' also supported women participating in politics.<br /><br />This woman speaking out against women's liberation also made for effective media coverage because it exposed political divisions among women themselves. The women who joined anti-ERA ratification efforts were older, more religious and had less formal education than their pro-ERA counterparts. Viewing homemaking as their identity, `pro family' women felt that the ERA ultimately called their own self-worth into question. Because they were so content with their homemaking role they did not want to concede that the same role was fact limiting for other women who wanted something else/more and freedom to pursue their freedoms. Having strictly defined social and legal limits thus gave ERA opponents the illusion of security even if the world did not always run as smoothly.<br /><br />Schlafly ironically has experienced her own sex discrimination. In spite of her best efforts, Ronald Reagan did not appoint her Secretary of Defense. She also has failed to get herself elected to public office. Despite MANY attempts made over the past 30 years---the `giant citizen base' which she always claims to speak on behalf of ultimately never transformed into electoral votes. These failures alternately prevent and save Schlafly from being held accountable by the `taxpayers'. She would not be able to function in an environment which demands a certain degree of party and/or ideological bipartisanship.<br /><br />Schlafly's positions for creationism, one-size-fits all reading instruction, and opposition to vaccines are noticeably downplayed by many other conservatives. Many other conservatives know that those areas do not deliver enough voters in order for them to win an election. Because most people continue to support the `liberal' position in these areas, Schlafly's influence ironically is restricted to certain `women's issues'. For somebody who considers herself an `honorary male' such political limits must be the ultimate irony.<br /><br />Critchlow notes that she continues to control the Eagle Forum, despite the token mentoring of younger conservative women who now join this organization through collegiate and youth chapters. The Eagle Forum remains an active force in American politics, but increasingly is being supplanted by `younger' organizations like the Independent Women's Forum who have a `fresh' appearance and concede the feminist movement has some merits such as theIndependent Women's Forum. Because any organization needs regular officer elections/leadership changes in order to keep their group fresh and responsive to member needs and the charter, I am curious what will happen to the Eagle Forum when Schlafly dies?<br /><br />He also examines the contradictions between Schafly's public gay-bashing and herself having a gay son. In 1992 John Schlafly was outed as gay, verifying that GLBT people do come from all families. Schlafly is the first to insist that she did everything `right' and promoted heterosexuality, but still cannot explain away her son's sexuality. Presently, Schlafly does less public attacking of gays than the other new right organizations, but she still labels them a threat---essentially labeling her own son a threat. John's public support for mom's political activities actually might belie a more complicated private relationship as a result.<br /><br />This book's only real flaw is that in addition to a portrait of Schlafly, Critchlow then attempts to talk about the American right in general at some depth. He argues the conservative movement impacted American politics, even if not in the exact ways which the groups and/or public figures intended.<br /><br />Although it's necessary to know that Schlafly's ultimate start in politics came as a researcher for the infamous red-hunter Senator Joseph McCarthy (R Wisconsin), a discussion of the right in general does not work in this same book. Agreeing that some comparison of leadership similarities and differences among other new right women is needed at some point, I think that he veered off his thesis during a lot of this other material and forgot what this particular book was supposed to be about during those points. These portions of his book are still scholarly, but subsequently become a case of trying to do too much with too little pages.

Those campaign speech books which actually dare to have substance unfortunately find themselves weighted down as being a product of their own time and the issues which they speak are not necessarily valid any longer.<br /><br />Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign had so many ongoing presidential campaign themes with 'today' that this book remains relevant. It is one of the few 'historical' books which seriously could end up also being classified in the current events section of a library just because Kennedy's policy prescriptive remain this poignant.<br /><br />This book (unlike previous texts from other authors) does not attempt to position Kennedy as a 'new democrat'. Rather, Norman Macafee uses Kennedy's own words to argue that he would have been a dam good president. Thinking is not a sign of weakness or indecisiveness, it is a sign of morality and ethics.<br /><br />When compared against the current White House occupant who is infamous for hating to intellectually rationalize the consequences of his own policies upon others, a politician with such a powerful social conscience is all the more inspiring. This is an excellent book for anybody on the left who needs a pick-me-up and anybody in general needing to read about a presidential candidate who knew where they stood and what they stood for.	2005-09-30

Aaron Glantz, a Pacifica radio correspondent, painstakingly traces where and how the United States repeatedly messed up in Iraq. His title radically differs from other books on the subject, using multiple sources to deliver one of the most multidimensional and sophisticated critiques of Iraq.<br /><br />Specifically, he talks to the Iraqi people themselves to get their own perspectives on this event.  Not surprisingly, they were initially skeptical of his intentions, but he built up enough trust to produce this book. It is disturbing that talking to the Iraqi people themselves is considered a radical action.<br /><br />Saddam Hussein was this infamous tyrant who appeared uninterested in his own people's well being so they were happy to get rid of him--until they also lost what basic services which they had been previously receiving. Glantz then writes that suicide bombings can be profitable for people who have been and are receiving little money otherwise in an allegedly rebuilt Iraq (pp. 119-120).<br /><br />Because I predominantly receive my own news about Iraq (and the Middle East) from American news media, I had not previously considered the economic incentives to participate in a suicide bombing. Some people are participating in these activities to feed themselves and/or their families, with many other options currently unavailable. I had honestly assumed that the people who participated in these events were doing this for socioreligious sincerity alone; however I guess it's easy for Washington officials to moralize and grandstand when they don't have to worry about their own children starving.<br /><br />Glantz also critiques us on the left for getting too in love with protesting against this very war. According to him, we are loosing perspective of the larger goal, again because we are also predominantly coming from and with an American-centric perspective.<br /><br />While we need to be concerned what is happening with American soldiers and tax dollars, we cannot forget that the Iraqi people might lack even the most rudimentary services which we take for granted. We talk about how hard organizing is, but many American activists (myself included) live in a country where we know that sanitation and electricity is working and we do not have to worry about roadside bombs as we travel around our cities. Perspective is everything in and to effective community organizing.<br /><br />There is considerable irony that President Bush and the Republican-controlled United States Government are so eager to talk about self-rule and democracy, but will not let the Iraqi people actually control their own lives.d tax dollars, we cannot forget that the Iraqi people might lack even the most rudimentary services which we take for granted.

Equalizing public school funding--hey, that's a different and amazingly still controversial policy.<br /><br />Public school funding ultimately is affected by politics. Citizens who are unhappy with the then-current distribution of public school resources can go to court and attempt to receive a redistribution order. The courts can also review school finance legislation and declare if these ultimately political programs are themselves constitutional.<br /><br />State and federal legislators can pass all of the laws they want, but then failing to address budgets will fail to address student's educational needs. This ultimately creates problems for the students themselves. Politics are being played with their education, and subsequently their lives.<br /><br />One of the most convincing briefs in the Brown case specifically was the disparate resources throughout the schools which African American communities had to use. Black students used the most run-down and worn materials and facilities when compared to White schools in a segregated community.<br /><br />Agreeing that students should know the basics, I am concerned that students whose schools lack money to instruct in the basics will have a difficult time then passing mandatory standardized testing programs in today's world.<br /><br />We do not formally discriminate on race/ethnicity anymore, but these testing programs provide a covert method for America to circumvent Brown. The politically loaded term \\"student achievement\\" is being used to justify return to draconian educational policies. We also forget there is more than one way for people to effectively process information.<br /><br />While reading this book, I also thought about the recent hurricane evacuees from Louisiana, a state where private schools are ultimately the norm.<br /><br />Originally set up so that white families would be able to get around desegregation orders, the predominance of private schooling for everybody (of all races) has resulted in Louisiana simply allocating much less money for it's public school systems.<br /><br />Texas certainly has it's own public school funding problems, but I hope that the families who had to temporarily settle in the Lone Star State took back with them the benefits of putting sufficient money into the public school system.<br /><br />America and its states are literally getting what they pay for from public education.e to effectively process information.    <br /> <br />While reading this book, I also thought about the recent hurricane evacuees from Louisiana, a state where private schools are ultimately the norm.  <br /> <br />Originally set up so that white families would be able to get around desegregation orders, the predominance of private schooling for everybody (of all races) has resulted in Louisiana simply allocating much less money for it's public school systems.  <br /> <br />Texas certainly has it's own public school funding problems, but I hope that the families who had to temporarily settle in the Lone Star State took back with them the benefits of putting sufficient money into the public school system.  <br /> <br />America and its states are literally getting what they pay for from public education.  <br />	2005-09-30

E government means that an order to dispatch troops can theoretically be given over the Internet--facilitating a public official's complete emotional removal from the consequences of their policies. Such a distance further depersonalizes the population receiving the troops, depersonalized women are at risk of being victimized by their alleged liberators.<br /><br />Equally important however, Whitworth questions whether these missions can respect the encountered women on their own terms regardless of who is in the peacekeeping ranks. Is peace merely the absence of violence as defined through Western cultural norms or is it consequently the presence of social justice? Since military training officially indoctrinates all soldiers to accept a certain set of values as being 'right', would and/or do women soldiers provide a egalitarian alternative?<br /><br />One of her most interesting chapters examines post-traumatic stress disorder as it relates to the militarized masculine identity. Rejecting the pop culture construction of these men as 'messed up' and 'unbalanced', Whitworth instead argues that men who are exhibiting culturally 'feminine' (and degraded) characteristics are in fact the ideal peacekeepers (p. 172). It is the military construct which needs to be overhauled; these men should be a model.<br /><br />She is also skeptical (pp. 220-221) because Security Council resolutions are fixated on doing the same thing in a different matter as opposed to recognizing the fundamental constructs of the existing system as being the problem. She believes that a different methodology of training and directing soldiers is needed.<br /><br />Whitworth recognizes that some form of military is in fact needed in some cases. However, she wants readers to think about the fundamentally gendered meanings and problems which current military policies are assigning and constantly reinforcing through their actions. This suggests that a feminist and truly peacekeeping military is possible.ecause Security Council resolutions are fixated on doing the same thing in a different matter as opposed to recognizing the fundamental constructs of the existing system as being the problem.

Attempting to square the pursuit of equality off with the acceptance of diversity and thus difference, Davina Cooper's book has some interesting propositions.<br /><br />In addition to the status quo, she concedes that feminist communities can also have monolithic tendencies if internal difference of opinion is not allowed (p. 40). She also gives her support to social justice movements which protect and enhance 'counter normative' ways of being (p. 9) simply because diversity is to be valued for diversity's sakes. It does not have to have an immediate tangible benefit to the status quo in order to be allowed.<br /><br />At the same time, her standard for judgment rests on what she personally considers to be an enhancement of (or at least not a threat to) social equality.<br /><br />Such a judgment process can start out with widely accepted strictures; we expect that people are no longer denied the right to vote on the basis of their skin color and that women should be able to vote.<br /><br />Yet, the measure of diversity inside a society becomes trickier when we are talking about private associations in America and other practices around the globe.  How do we support these group's right to exist while they internally are engaging in processes which we do not find diverse and may even be counter productive to the concept of diversity. Even inside America, some churches (notably the Roman Catholic) prohibit women from the priesthood.<br /><br />Her book is intriguing precisely because the thesis is packed with ambiguities which ring current in our own world (p. 26). The book is dense in some places, but would be good reading for people who are really interested in diversity politics and/or the social sciences. I could see this book being adopted for an upper-level undergraduate class and/or a graduate class.	2005-09-30

We are time and/or money consuming entities that are still honestly not perceived as contributing anything to society let alone being recognized as social equals.<br /><br />This inequality then leads people to interpret the ADA as a burden on them as opposed to considering the greater burdens which unjust discrimination places on both the recipient and the nation.<br /><br />However, I have one minor suggestion to ensure that this book gets to those most needing to read it.<br /><br />Change the title to more accurately reflect that this book is a critique of how society handles disability instead of something itself which opposes the disability rights movement. Because the disability rights movement is acknowledged as seeking liberation of stereotypical attitudes and laws, it aids Mary Johnson's case.	2005-09-29

Bush had on his foreign policy choices. Interviews conducted during 1996-1999 with former administration officials provide important insights how that Iraq war was fought--and why it was won with relatively little causalities.<br /><br />Needing to deflect citizen attention and scrutiny from his less-than stellar domestic policies, Bush shamelessly and openly promoted Saddam Hussein as a Arabic Adolph Hitler.<br /><br />Because the now dead German dictator remains one of the most loathed figures in world history, the president's label provided an instant rallying point for a majority of Americans and world leaders to act. Since appeasement had failed so miserably the first time, very few people were eager to attempt a reenactment, proactively stopping another Hitler was its own tangible evidence and justification rolled into one.<br /><br />Bush was able to position himself as the commander because he had ample congressional support (from then-Democratic majorities), funding, international coalition allies, and a challenge which itself was not difficult to manage. Critically differing from Hitler, Saddam did not have a coalition of Middle East states openly supporting him and the countries nearest to Iraq ultimately donated space for the allies to stage their own forces.<br /><br />With America currently in a much different Iraq war with another Bush, this book is an essential read. It is important remembering however those international successes could not negate the American people from examining the domestic economy performance.	2005-09-29

He was consumed by immense pain and loneliness while playing the sardonic wit who managed to leave audiences with a smile and wanting more.<br /><br />He is most noted for `Uncle Arthur' on `Bewitched', one of Samantha Stephens's (Elizabeth Montgomery's) relatives who liked Darrin for being himself. He is also famous for being the most popular `center square' on Hollywood Squares, although he was not the original.<br /><br />The sitcom `Bewitched' used a `witch/mortal' plotline to project interracial marriage issues into suburbia on a weekly basis. It's fitting that Lynde also used his guest star episodes to deliver what is now recognized as being queer commentary. I was too young to grasp the in-jokes when catching the episodes, but now see many cleverly placed references---aided by his delivery. However, it's also sad that the 1960's weren't swinging for everybody<br /><br />Because Lynde was from a generation and in an era where gay people were `deviants' he did not accept himself.  Like Darrin #2 Dick Sargent, Lynde had to make the inevitable and difficult choice. How much of his real self could he afford to disclose in public? The humor which audiences did see was the end result of Lynd's unenviable internal conflict. It was not easy being Paul Lynde.<br /><br />Internal conflict ultimately led to his substance abuse. Substance abuse problems and his unresolved internal conflicts led to brutish treatment of others and ultimately his early death. Lynde died January 1982 at the age of 55.  Lynde had friends (Charlotte Rae, Cloris Leachman) but even they could not help him. He needed to have been able to help himself instead.<br /><br />Normally I'm not a big fan of corporately published books on one person, I tend to think they are too glossy and that I am not receiving the full picture. However, I am making a very big exception with this title. Having existed pre-Stonewall itself, the Advocate had the sensitivity which was needed to give Lynde's memory a truly appropriate tribute.<br /><br />This straight woman can't help wondering what else Lynde could have accomplished in a later time when he would have been able to be himself. My generation tends to take 'coming out' for granted, but the fact that we are able to have these public expressions today saves us a lot of heart ache and internal conflict.ocate had the sensitivity which was needed to give Lynde's memory a truly appropriate tribute.   <br /> <br />This straight woman can't help wondering what else Lynde could have accomplished in a later time when he would have been able to be himself.

It had so much potential too!<br /><br />Instead of encouraging women to define by what and how they are individually comfortable expressing themselves, Ariel Levy rushed to insist that women are 'different' from men. She then argues that society should therefore have a 'different' standard of culture for women and men. This is a tired and worn argument which (ironically) was used to justify sex discrimination throughout American society.<br /><br />Levy ironically is so concerned about protecting 'women's freedom' that she subsequently attempts to channel us into her own uniform definition of what is 'good'. Anybody engaging in her subjective definition of 'raunchy' then becomes suspect; they are presumed to work against 'the feminist movement'. In this book, the feminist movement is narrowly defined as everything which agrees with Ariel Levy's world view and there is no room for dissent.<br /><br />She forgets that many of the women's rights advocates interspersed throughout this same manuscript pointedly fought for women's bodily autonomy. We grew up with unprecedented public sphere freedoms compared to those revolutionaries. We thus have an obligation to use our freedoms when and how we are personally comfortable, individual women can choose individual options.<br /><br />Her prescription is also inadequate in the eras of the metrosexual and queer politics. Ignoring these critiques of heteronormative masculinity, she pretends that men=heterosexual raunch. Upon finishing the book, I wondered if she inadvertently sought this book contract as a parody just because its scope is so shallow.<br /><br />Levy's manuscript could possibly have a point if women are literally being forced to wear certain clothing styles and adopt certain behaviors. Yet, I've always been able to wear what I want and act in the manner which is most comfortable for me.en able to wear what I want and act in the manner which is most comfortable for me.   <br />	2005-09-25

Consequently most American stories about the war in Iraq are told through the eyes of Americans. This includes accounts which oppose our being in Iraq, even so-called liberals have conventional views on Iraq.<br /><br />American society's tendency to focus on current events and avoid considering the perspective of other nation states prevented us from thinking about how this war (regardless of motive) would be perceived. The Bush administration's throngs of cheering Iraqi's never materialized and we are regarded with suspicion. The Iraqi people did not particularly care for Saddam Hussein either, but he was much more open with the people of Iraq about his desire for power over them.<br /><br />Regarding the Iraqis as objects to be manipulated as opposed to people with their own ideas...etc it should not be surprising the United States is having so much trouble in Iraq. The Iraq people would like to govern themselves, but cannot if we have our troops and oil companies planted firmly in that country. We ourselves send conflicting messages about democracy and freedom by failing to recognize their agency.<br /><br />Anthony Shadid also examined the role which cultural misunderstandings played in American blunders. Erroneously assuming that all people shared one culture, Americans positioned themselves as the ones who would provide it. He also covers the milestone 2005 election and the sense of hope that self-governance brings to the Iraqi people. However seeing as how American troops still occupy Iraq, this event might ultimately be remembered by the Iraqi people as a brief high point in their confirmed rough existence.  He also attempts to explain what years of constant war does to a population beyond the obvious physical and socioeconomic costs.<br /><br />I would still recommend that people opposing America's invasion of Iraq read more conventional anti-war books, but we also need to read this account. It is important that we recognize the people of Iraq as three-dimensional beings and do not reduce them into sound bites for our side.It is important that we recognize the people of Iraq as three-dimensional beings and do not reduce them into sound bites for our side.	2005-09-20

This reinforced the idea that these women are professional athletes.<br /><br />I have been a devoted fan ever since that historic first season. I especially loved that my Comets were the first league champions (a title which they held until recently). Because so many other people had placed bets on New York (which at least in the 1970's was an epicenter for women's rights) having Houston lead the way in professional women's sports was a nice surprise.<br /><br />There has been some reshuffling of the teams (Utah, Cleveland, and Miami's teams have transferred cities or folded all together). However this league is surpassing the expectations of people who assumed that the WNBA would not last. We have shown the doubters that women's professional basketball is here to stay in America.<br /><br />Although there are salary (the players in this league are paid low for professional athlete standards) and financial issues (the WNBA has yet to make a profit as defined in business terms) the WNBA scores lots of points in my book.	2005-09-20

Meanwhile, predominantly black and Hispanic children are consigned to attend run-down inner city schools whose administrators and staff (even the 'good and caring' ones) must spend the scant money they do receive on rote memorization.<br /><br />Socioeconomic discrepancy will subsequently be used to track those students into an altogether different set of life opportunities.<br /><br />In addition to economics, Kozol heaps blame at the rise of standardized testing programs. Instituted with the then-idealistic idea they would help schools, teachers, and parents proactively diagnose \\"learning problems\\" so all students could then achieve, these programs have instead become a tool in creating and reinforcing the disparities.<br /><br />Students unable to pass the testing program become branded as 'failure' subsequently limiting their academic and other future options---all on the results of one piece of paper. Examining the current high-stakes test-centric enviroment, it is difficult to believe that this public policy originated as a program intended to help all children.<br /><br />'Whose children are being helped in America's schools with our current policies?' should be asked<br /><br />All school districts are vulnerable to 'teaching to the program' but such actions hurt already short-changed inner city students much more than the suburbanite. Because the former school has money to spare outside of the testing programs, compliance with federal and state testing program requirements (no matter how unrealistic the benchmark definitions of student success) is easier to absorb. The same school struggling to keep working toilets is not as fortunate.<br /><br />Brilliant observations aside, Kozol did not factor in how disability affects education. I had attended a 'rich' school district, but had my own experiences with tracking and unequal resources because I was a special education student who was enrolled in a resource math class.

Neither he, family, nor friends, could have predicted that he would subsequently be shipped off to Iraq with the rest of the National Guard.<br /><br />And so begins the (gripping) story of the accidental solider.<br /><br />Like all realistic depictions of war, this book presents American soldiers as multi-dimensional. The soldiers aren't thrilled to be in Iraq either and are frustrated with Washington bureaucracy. This book is not specifically listed as anti-war, but now (as then) having been in the conflict encourages veterans to be critical of official government positions; they have no illusions about what is going on over in Iraq.<br /><br />The soldiers were expected to make do with inadequate supplies or (amazingly enough) purchase their own equipment, personally I'm not sure what the government expected them to do with those supplies if they even came home. The soliders don't feel like they are great freedom fighters, they are only interested in survival.<br /><br />Crawford physically survived, but the combined horrors of war ultimately took their toll on him (and other soldiers). The nature of their conflict played psychological games with his mind---to the point that he was willing to kill people in order just to get himself home. Being in Iraq under constant fire from a 'hidden' army of civilians was a destructive experience.<br /><br />Not starting out with any particular animosity towards the Iraqi people themselves, Crawford soon becomes unnerved from the constant new environment which he and the other American soldiers are living under. They are allegedly there to liberate the Iraqi's, but are not receiving a warm and loving reception from the Iraqi people.<br /><br />Like other people in his unit, Crawford turned to sleeping pills. It might have started innocently enough to help him get a somewhat regular sleep cycle, but this soon led to other substances. By the end of the book, Crawford is mixing this with whiskey and beer, an already dangerous cocktail enhanced by the surroundings.<br /><br />Jingoistic accounts of war conveniently ignore the many human costs of each conflict. A solider that comes back physically intact actually can be emotionally shattered. If I had my way, the vapid drones still displaying the 'support our troops' car ribbon magnets would have to read this book and contemplate the economic and social discrepancies facing newly enlisted troops and returning veterans.<br /><br />It is only in GI Joe cartoons that war is easily waged without a nationwide sacrifice of any kind. This book clarifies what and who America sacrifices now is not effective.im get a somewhat regular sleep cycle, but this soon led to other substances.

I've also dealt with high school personnel who had formally discouraged me from going to college only because I had been in special education.<br /><br />However, finding out federal and state laws (and remembering that your state cannot trump the federal laws with their programs) is a much more useful alternative than limiting oneself with outdated college application advice.<br /><br />Yes, I dealt with a college administrator who attempted to kick me out because of my disability, but knowing my legal rights and responsibilities in the college environment made the critical difference. Subsequently that same administrator left while I went on to successfully complete my education at the same place I had initially enrolled at. Self-responsibility and advocacy is the key for an effective college experience.<br /><br />If (and this is a very big if) Mary Beth Kravets and Imy Wax really wanted students with disabilities in college they would be insisting the same and providing their readership with accurate information.  Shame on them for misleading people with outdated prescriptives!	2005-09-16

Horton's masterpiece is going to raise a couple of eyebrows.<br /><br />The more rabid critics of this book are going to accuse her of living in the past. During the 1960's, new left activists from the Black Power movement formulated a civil rights analysis concluding the entire American system would have to be reformed, even with non-discrimination laws on the books, socioeconomic structure would effectively keep many people oppressed and equality an empty gesture.<br /><br />Yet, to effectively have a non-racist future we must understand and the actually undo the past. That critique assumes new significance today when the gap between America's haves and have-nots is reaching unprecedented proportions. It is more relevant than ever.<br /><br />An independent scholar and Research Associate at Erikson Institute, Chicago, Illinois, Horton postulates that race has more socioeconomic dimensions than we previously had admitted.  Some African Americans (realizing their own stake) are going to actually support the maintenance of the status quo.<br /><br />Such wide experience discrepancy explains how we get people like JC Watts, Condoleezza Rice, Barack Obama, and Jesse Jackson. They are all black, but each has a different opinion on how well the `American way' is working for everybody.<br /><br />Horton gives civil rights movements their due credit for having implemented a more consistent practice of democracy than prior models, but questions if the current system is still the best that we can do. Our society presently uses those progress markers as justification that we now do not have to critique anything any more, and thus are stunting ourselves from realizing a truly equitable outcome for all members.<br /><br />She also calls for a more elastic conceptualization of racial and class identity.

Now indelibly associated with MASH and the 1970's, his life was---and is----much more beyond Benjamin \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce. In his own words, Alda's autobiography delivers a sentimental portrait of this second generation actor.<br /><br />The son of actor Robert Alda, Alan knew that he also wanted to act from an early age. However there were some initial bumps to the dream being realized. In addition to coping with a childhood bout of polio, the younger Alda also dealt with a mentally ill mother. Using his trademark humor, Alda recounts how his love for mom existed alongside concern what she would do to the family and/or herself. Given what people were being treated with back then, keeping her at home was the infinitely more compassionate option-albeit not without its own challenges upon the family. Such experiences ultimately prompted Alan to develop his trademark sensitivity to others.<br /><br />Family is a recurring theme throughout this book. In a profession where marriages are acquired and discarded like consumer goods, his 48-year marriage to Arlene really is something to brag about. They've also managed to raise three daughters, again defying the Hollywood odds of the `dysfunctional family' being an inevitable counterbalance to meteoric fame.  I'm guessing the Washington D.C. `family values' crowd is too busy protecting the sanctity of marriage to take notice of somebody who actually illustrates it.<br /><br />Politics is another theme running throughout this book. Bucking the route taken by many other leading men, Alda used his celebrity to lobby on behalf of the feminist movement. This involvement ultimately resulted in his being named an honorary co-chair (along with former Republican First Lady Betty Ford) of the Equal Rights Amendment ratification countdown campaign. The sincerity which Alda and wife Arlene (who contributed photos for Ms. Magazine) have for this cause is genuinely inspiring, it's not at all a case of him `helping the ladies' or being `politically correct'. His passion for social justice is noticeably missing from many of today's actors-who are content to let their female co-stars (say anything if at all) about women's equality.  Alda was a pioneer metrosexual.<br /><br />M*A*S*H itself is obviously given some space in this book. M*A*S*H worked when it did because a combination of good writers, directors, actors, and perfect political timing. The show was allegedly set in Korea but (as intended) viewers easily saw it as an anti-Vietnam war commentary. The medical personnel patching up soldiers in military hospitals received constant reminders that war is not `fun' or `just'.<br /><br />Other sections in this book include Alda's movie work (Betsy's Wedding) and return to television acting with guest spots on ER (among other shows). I was gennuinely riveted to the story of his emergency appendectomy in Chile.<br /><br />I'm still struck by the humility which this guy exhibits considering that M*A*S*H royalties essentially mean that he does not have to work today. Alda's book stresses that he has loved what he does.<br /><br />This book belongs in the `few-but-proud' collection of celebrity memoirs actually having something of worth for readers. Alda waited so long to deliver this project (which he probably had thought about earlier) so he would be able to give the manuscript the full attention it deserved. The wait paid off because this product is one of the better biographies that I have read.inspiring, it's not at all a case of him `helping the ladies' or being `politically correct'.

His thoughtful analysis of environmental policies (or not) under Republican presidential administrations including George W. Bush exposes the anti-science environment which today's GOP is supporting.<br /><br />Buoyed by a now infamous alliance of free-marketers and fundamentalists, the GOP alternately ignores or derides anything which gets in it's way of power. The current party head, George W. Bush is just being less covert about the policy objectives than had his predecessors.<br /><br />Newly elected president Ronald W. Reagan distinguished himself (using the term very loosely) in 1981 when he said that trees cause more pollution than automobiles. In 1979, Reagan mentioned that the American Petroleum Institute had filed suit against the EPA with that data, but there is no record of the data having ever existed.<br /><br />Global warming....medical research...evolution. The Republican Party does not take existence of these so-called 'issues' seriously. Such admission would expose and ultimately undo the Republican party's current activist base.<br /><br />The Republicans have an issue quandary: do they continue supporting that activist base coalition and continue winning campaigns, or do they support science---and get turned on by the group. As out of touch as those activists are, they can command the GOP's attention. America ultimately is suffering as a result of this partnership.<br /><br />Mooney explicitly notes that a previous Republican president, Richard M. Nixon, had excellent science policies in contrast. Nixon publicly railed against 'liberal intellectuals' but it turns out that he made some important contributions. His administration had the first Environmental Protection Agency, and he signed anti-pollution bills emphasizing that people had to be responsible for the planet's health. We are indeed a far cry from those days if we have reached an era where environmental stewardship is regarded as the proverbial third wheel.<br /><br />Whatever terms they choose to call it (creationism vs. intelligent design) the current ideology ultimately shortchanges the country.<br /><br />Science, like democracy, is based upon asking questions and participating in the world. In light of everything else which was pulled, it is a reasonable assessment to conclude that the Republican's attack on science perfectly meshes with their elitism and distrust of the people.verbial third wheel.    <br /> <br />Whatever terms they choose to call it (creationism vs. intelligent design) the current ideology ultimately shortchanges the country.  <br /> <br />Science, like democracy, is based upon asking questions and participating in the world.

This ever-timely book documents the FBI's activities against the new left. Under the guise of preventing communism, then-director J. Edgar Hoover ordered agents to infiltrate the black power and American Indian movements.<br /><br />Comprised of young articulate and intelligent young activists, both movements delivered a scathing critique of the American system, the system itself was structured to support and maintain racism. This scared many traditionalists who genuinely believed America to have the best form of government.<br /><br />Since the traditionalists held the power in America, they did not want to cede it to `different' people. The words and actions of radicals ultimately hit much closer to home than they had wanted to admit. Consequently the FBI was used to `contain' these people.<br /><br />Because the public had an image of the FBI as brave and heroic men (women were not agents until Hoover's death) the activists who attempted to publicize the actual behavior were derided. After all, it seemed a surreal proposition that the United States would defend democracy by stifling the actions of it's own citizens.<br /><br />Counter Intelligence Program (COINTELLPRO) events included the soapish (spreading rumors about the sexuality of an `activist colleague') to the deadly (the FBI attempting to murder new left leaders---and leave the cases closed) but all undermined the rights of all American people to live in a democracy.<br /><br />The American people only now know about these events themselves because of the Freedom Of Information Act.<br /><br />Ward Churchill and Jim Vanderwall deliver a thought provoking book needing to be read by everybody and anybody concerned about the current state of affairs. The book's emotional tone is expected given the subject matter--and especially relevant today when so many of our public officials want to expand wiretapping in the name of 'security'.<br /><br />Communism and the red scare are (long) gone as an alibi, but what will seriously prevent the FBI from resuming their role as America's political police?---if they are not doing so already?e as an alibi, but what will seriously prevent the FBI from resuming their role as America's political police?---if they are not doing so already?  <br /> <br />	2005-09-13

Examining the politics of representing black men's bodies, he argues that appearance can and does effectively influence civil rights.<br /><br />From the days of slavery to the civil rights movement, black men being too assertive in the public sphere was a breach of the 'social order' established by racist white society.<br /><br />Even people who were allegedly on their side (white abolitionists) depicted black men as 'begging' for their freedom, inferring dependence and weakness--decidedly 'unmasculine' traits.<br /><br />Alternately, black men's sexuality was portrayed as a threat to the established order. A black man who had any degree of contact with a white woman in any context risked being perceived as the 'rapist' an ultra-masculine stereotype. Ironically, the white individuals and their organized hate groups claimed to only be protecting white women with the subsequent lynching being through `white masculinity's' obligation to `protect' the women of `our community'.<br /><br />Because it was safer for black men during those times, they consequently adopted a position of subservience to the 'larger world'. Black women took an active lead in the earliest civil rights movements out of practicality.<br /><br />Whether they had all of the theories our society now has access to, the Black Panthers also articulated a critique of black masculinity and political legitimacy. Sharply contrasting against the buffoonish 'Jim Crow' their ideal black man was an articulate, proactive, solider fighting on behalf of himself, his community, and his people.<br /><br />Estes is passionate about his work and makes a generally convincing case for his thesis. I am curious that his manuscript did not include a more extensive examination of the Black Pather's articulated desire to build (then-unprecedented) alliances with homosexuals and women. There's some information about each group in this book, but nothing about this earliest coalition building attempt and nothing how that action had challenged heterosexism within the Black Panthers, or the after effects for black masculinity as a political force.e about his work and makes a generally convincing case for his thesis.

This requires community non-profits to make themselves, their objectives, and accomplishments (including closely-related prior paid and volunteer experience) known to the public.<br /><br />Art Feinglass is the founder and president of Access Corporation. He has over 20 years of non-profit field experience, including with public relations. Feinglass made sure that his book was transferable to real world non-profit situations and it wasn't indulgence in abstract ideas.<br /><br />First, an objectives list needs to be produced: Who do we want to reach, and what message are we trying to communicate with them? Even though non-profits do have limited resources, the one-size-fits all advertising approach is going to be dangerously ineffective, wasting much more money in the process.<br /><br />Then you have to decide who in the organization will deliver the message and what media in the community will deliver the message too. If I am planning a left-wing event, it's probably not wise to deliver announcements to socially conservative media---unless I want to face pickets.<br /><br />Effective activists will also have to spend time on these materials. Whether planning an event or pr materials, nothing should be left to chance. This influences how people think of the organization. How the organization is thought of by the community in turn affects its ultimate ability to create change.<br /><br />Finally, evaluating the success of your current PR plan is essential. Don't assume that responsibilities end when the materials go out. Constantly keeping people informed and aware of what your organization is doing in the community translates into them continuing to regard it as a worthy cause.

Gould's comprehensive work explains how speech restrictions were introduced and thrive in the 'free' college campus. Supposedly implemented to protect students, these 'free speech zones' were really about following the lead of other schools who implemented them first.<br /><br />The free speech zones themselves emerged in the aftermath of the 1960s. Colleges presumed that if they could control where people were protesting, they could control the atmosphere of the protest---and prevent things from getting out of hand.<br /><br />The courts however are concerned that colleges acted in excess. The establishment of these zones was not legitmately connected to public safety. Furthermore, circumstances did not warrant a measure as severe as limiting the student body's constitutional right to free speech.<br /><br />Because universities cannot demonstrate how the restriction of adult's speech ultimately contributes to the free inquiry needed in post-secondary environments, free speech zones and the other restrictions are under fire. The petitioners allege that these restrictions violate their right to free speech.<br /><br />As 'offensive speech' is a largely subjective matter, today's protestor against 'hate speech' might very well find themselves being picketed for 'offensive speech' if these laws are to stand. Especially in the post-secondary environment, free speech restrictions stifle democracy, learning---and the very mission of the institutions.<br /><br />Yes, this means that people will periodically run into speech they find objectionable, but this is a rather insignificant price to pay for living in a democracy.<br /><br />Gould does not provide easy answers inside his work. Rather he wants the readers of this title to understand how having a monolithic blanket against the 'offensive' is an impossible policy to implement.  What initially comforts us today might restrict us in the near future. Such is the difficulty of regulating speech.<br /><br />This work is important for academic libraries, but it is also a worthwhile read for civil libertarians, and activists. I would finally recommend that the local public library stock a copy because the First Amendment is so important to a free society.<br />This work is important for academic libraries, but it is also a worthwhile read for civil libertarians, and activists.

Lin notes the groups inside these ethnic enclaves are not homogenous and have their own disagreements with each other over what direction is best for the community to follow.<br /><br />Including the information about intra-community transformation actions is important because 'white' society tended to portray Chinatowns as monolithic entities whose members intrinsically agree with one another. While such blanket stereotyping was prevalent in the past, it still continues because this work itself would not be as consciousness-raising as it is if society acknowledged this community's complexity.<br /><br />Lin examined New York's Chinatown, but his research is broadly applicable to any part of the country with Chinatown (or Asian) enclaves. The founders of NYC's Chinatown (and others across America) inadvertently pioneered urban redevelopment when they settled into properties which society had cast off.<br /><br />Increasingly Chinatown residents are entering and impacting American politics. Voter registrar offices are now having to provide registration and election materials in these languages. In addition to being courted by politicians, the Chinatown residents are also becoming politicians themselves.<br /><br />Ultimately finding his research intersecting with many facets of my own work, I recommend Lin's book for people interested in Asian American studies. It is also a good read for people undertaking community development work with Asian American communities.	2005-09-01

Bush was reelected in spite of many odds against him. Corporate scandals, an unpopular war, and culturally divisive social policies did not effectively prevent the Bush administration from remaining in office<br /><br />What on earth happened to America?<br /><br />The author argues that for all Bush's gaffes (and he does point them out) he and his campaign teams effectively revived people's strong need for belonging. I initially had associated this stage with preadolescence, so I really was amazed to see it's documentation throughout the campaign trail.<br /><br />Regardless of what actually benefits him and his friends alone, Bush took many seemingly disparate groups of voters and made them feel like they were also part of the in-crowd. That sense of belonging ultimately provided incentive to vote Republican.<br /><br />Because nobody likes believing that their crowd is turning on them, these people honestly and sincerely do not want to believe that same president is advocating for policies which will only benefit a very tiny fraction of America---and they are not included among the beneficiaries. Instead of arguing how horrible a person Bush is, a new campaign strategy is needed to reach these voters.<br /><br />Other books attempted to examine the psyche of Bush supporters and voters, but too often resorted to one-dimensional and partisan caricatures--which turned off the very people most needing to read that information. We had convinced ourselves Bush was a bad president but failed explaining this to other people.<br /><br />Powers's book is infinitely more valuable because he concedes that the people who voted for Bush are not evil or bereft of their brain cells. Avoiding such cheap shots is the first step for the supporters of other presidential candidates to convince Bush voters that we are also interested in their needs, and are actually looking out for them.	2005-09-01

It is only applicable to certain types of activists who fight their fights in small and/or rural communities.<br /><br />I'm happy that Ms. Perlman and her friends were able to stop counterproductive redevelopment in their own community. However, I am also concerned that she generalizes too readily about the immediate applicability of this book to all people's situations.<br /><br />Like other reviewers have previously noted, she does not recognize that different environments need adjustments in organizing strategies. This is an embarrassing mantra for somebody who positions herself as an author and activist.<br /><br />One of my long-standing pet peeves is activists who are ultimately in love with the idea of `being progressive' rather than actually following through on it. Because they will not concede the flaws in their own arguments, these people are often more shallow than the society which they seek to change.<br /><br />Yes, it worked for her, but many of the tactics would be impractical in a metropolis where activists are expected to work through and with boards in order to impact social change. Increasing gentrification of `redeveloping' urban centers means smart development policies can be a hot seller there too---with the right sales pitch.<br /><br />Her social justice prescriptions aren't going to provide anything to people who cannot use the remedies in their own organizing environments. Unlike John P. Kretzmann and John L. McKnight (authors of `Building communities from the inside out') she generalizes about communities. What was her point of writing a `practice' book if the tenets cannot actually be put into practice?<br /><br />This book would be better off repackaged as a handbook for rural and small suburban communities.

While reading this book, I knew the author was talking about the experiences which I and too many other people have.<br /><br />We are always at fault for something, regardless of what it is. We are called 'mental' by our families for not liking that abuse! Meanwhile we try to be 'good' and not insult them back with something. During this silence we up making ourselves sick through that acting; we are emotionally and mentally better off without our parents.<br /><br />If unhappy people can divorce from an unhealthy marriage, people who are unhappy with their families ought to be able to divorce their parents too.<br /><br />Finding a supportive and healthy family of your own choosing is much better than attempting to ride things out with a family that chose you.

However, I am also aware that sound-bites can (and do) prevent the real person from coming through sometimes. After reading this book, I am convinced that Trent Lott is in fact a man who holds vendettas against the people he disagrees with.<br /><br />In addition to liberal Democrats like me, Mr. Lott is also comfortable attacking the most conservative members of his own Republican party. Unless things are being done according to his specifications, Lott is going to get mad at them. No longer having to count on them for 'favors' he is now free to let the fur fly in this scathing memoir.<br /><br />For all of his years on the \\"Hill\\" Lott refused to believe that a Republican White House would not necessarily agree with him and the Senate on all of the issues either. They have their own political hides to worry about and providing coattails is an 'extra' service, when times get tough they are the first thing pulled up.  Lott forgot to check the White House Senate relations when the Republicans had briefly held the Senate during the Reagan administration. A little thought goes a long way in the political arena.<br /><br />Because the GOP was trying to increase the number of African American voters, other Republican Senators and the president promptly declined to support Lott---instead pressing for his resignation. Lott could not bring himself to concede how his own actions threatened to undercut the `compassionate conservatism' message which was carefully crafted by GOP spin doctors.<br /><br />Lott is upset that he is no longer the Senate majority leader and it went to somebody other than himself. I don't think his outrage is directed against the current leader Bill Frist (TN) as a person, it's just that 'Trent Lott is not calling the shots anymore' and he's still harboring hurt feelings over that loss of power.<br /><br />Anybody could have assumed the Majority Leader position following his resignation and Lott would have found something intrinsically wrong with them---just because they weren't him!<br /><br />Separating this book from good political memoirs (such as those by Bush Sr.) Lott fails to assume total responsibility for his own leadership loss, and does not provide a book reflecting the real breadth of his career in federal politics. Considering how long he served I honestly believe that many more things were left out of the manuscript for this book. It does not read like the work of a person who was an epicenter for the Republican Party.sition following his resignation and Lott would have found something intrinsically wrong with them---just because they weren't him! <br /> <br />Separating this book from good political memoirs (such as those by Bush Sr.) Lott fails to assume total responsibility for his own leadership loss, and does not provide a book reflecting the real breadth of his career in federal politics.

The kids are not the means to a monthly check, but a way to show the world that 'I had this many strikes against me and I became an adult'. Coming from a middle class background myself, I was particularly struck that these young men are telling women that they want to have a baby with HER eyes (p. 31) because I then realized that a baby would in fact be a representation of the two people having been together at one point.<br /><br />Ideally they would continue to stay together and raise the kid, but the authors (who previously wrote on urban poverty and welfare issues) also harbor no illusions about the young men who leave during a pregnancy and after a baby is born. Yet they also avoid finger-pointing and moralizing in favor of then examining the role which American society plays in encouraging these young teens to have sex and babies.<br /><br />Again we go back to the community infrastructure arguments and a disturbing but cognizant picture of complicity develops. Public figures restricting both reproductive and social services in these communities are ironically doing more to encourage subsequent generations to keep having sex.  When the women become pregnant, the public figures (like some of the men in this book) develop selective amnesia and refuse to support policies which would help these kids ...etc.<br /><br />This book is an excellent read for students of welfare/welfare reform. It is also highly recommended for politicians because this group of pre-teens/teenagers is so maligned in American public policy (from abortion access to welfare). Finally, this book is an informative but exciting read for the average person needing to find out what goes on beyond their own little back yard.s because this group of pre-teens/teenagers is so maligned in American public policy (from abortion access to welfare).

It is the first edition of OBOS which I feel really addresses the equally pressing healthcare needs of myself and younger generations of women.<br /><br />I had used prior versions of this book, but still had felt that the authors of those versions assumed that the readers had been with them through the 1970's...etc. The tone of this book is very inclusive and non-presuming. Consequently the medical information presented does not get lost in the personal vingettes. Our own generational experiences are just as important.<br /><br />Also, the authors take an enligthened approach to sexuality instead of segmenting off \\"LGBT/queer\\" issues into a couple of areas.

Ronald Reagan campaigned and then was elected on a promise to restore American virility. In the closing years of the cold war, we wanted to believe that America was a super power and that we ourselves were super.<br /><br />Who better suited for that type of positioning than a former Hollywood actor? I think the \\"1950's Doc Brown\\" from the 1985 blockbuster 'Back to the Future' spoke for many people when he just expressed shock that an actor ended up as President of the United States. Yet, it made perfect sense in the early years of the cable revolution when the 'best' public official was one who did manipulate the media for their message.<br /><br />The author examines how this manipulation provided a needed boost to America. We were still recovering from Vietnam and had difficulty realizing that we were perhaps not the center of the world. Reagan's campaign was genius because it essentially said 'don't' and encouraged swing voters to believe that everything would be solved if they elected Reagan.<br /><br />Reagan made critical inroads with 'blue-collar' democrats. These voters had supported the party on economic issues but had been increasingly at odds with the Democrats on social issues. Specifically because of his own Hollywood background, Reagan knew these voters could be won if he stressed 'morals' and 'tradition' regardless of how he (a twice divorced man who had signed off on the liberalization of abortion laws as California Governor) actually felt about those same issues. Appearance IS everything in politics.<br /><br />The author also makes clear that the Reagan years are not admirable. Troy explains how the feel good images of success and luxury were sharply contrasting with the reality being experienced by many people. The rapidly rising cost of living, spending cuts, and the AIDS epidemic prevented many other people from enjoying the prosperity.	2005-08-25

For all of the talk about 'standards' and 'accountability' America expects its teachers to do so much with very little.<br /><br />Teachers are horribly paid for all of the work which they are expected to do--and their responsibilities keep on growing. This is madness.<br /><br />In my own home state of Texas, school teacher salaries are determined by the local property tax paid in individual districts. The 'local control' which is promised under this arrangement sounds great until we realize that teachers are also expected to be a counselor...etc but do not get any extra compensation for these assignments. Well-heeled school districts and schools are the exception and not the rule inside public education.<br /><br />That America presently has the amount of public school teachers which it does is more testament to their idealism of wanting to make the world a little better place rather than the 'benefits'. It is a travesty that our country has teachers starving themselves (and their families) while ensuring that a community's children are being taken care of.<br /><br />After seeing what neighbors, friends, and the people inside this book go through, I am convinced that public school teachers are among the closest things which America has to saints. I am also concerned that the public policy discrepancies which are painstakingly illustrated by the authors will continue festering unless concrete action is undertaken.	2005-08-22

Using very loaded flag-waving rhetoric, this government is attempting to have people believe that any criticism of their actions is infact support for 'the terrorists'.<br /><br />The problem is that 'the terrorists' are never actually identified and remain annoymous masses in this same scenario. After all, the real focus of the Bush administration is keeping people scared so many will not question the actions of their government and there is a greater chance that those who do dissent can be labeled as 'troublemakers'.<br /><br />During the 1960's the federal government used 'red menace' rhetoric to justify the wiretapping and surveliance of left wing activists. The 'remote' possibility of communist infiltration (and subsequent social impacts) in these organizations were considered enough to justify the actions. Following Hoover's death, Congress placed long-needed restrictions on the FBI's ability to place American citizens under surveliance and made that information available through public request. To read the administration's support for the PATRIOT Act honestly feels like we are ignoring all of this history and failing to learn from the past.<br /><br />This failure is also how a 'conservative' administration squares the obviously expanded bureacracy against their public promotion of limited government. PATRIOT Act expansions are a big exception to their usual rules specifically because the conservatives are the ones who are doing the government expansion and surveliance. The ultimate impact on citizen freedoms is secondary (if weighted at all) to the president and his buddies getting and maintaining their absolute power over everybody else.<br /><br />The conclusions in this book are chilling---and ever more accurate with each passing day. It is an accessible read for people wanting affirmation that they are not reading into things, but is also important for audiences who need to know what their government is really doing.he president and his buddies getting and maintaining their absolute power over everybody else.

The now-infamous WMD claim is only the tail end of their deception. Thus by default, investigative journalists such as himself become the all-critical truth seekers.<br /><br />Such a placement undoubtedly echoes Watergate, but unlike then the newspapers of record have been silent as the Bush administration more or less does whatever it wanted. According to Lindorff, the 'snafus' which make the mainstream media really were not accident at all. They are part of the Bush administration's concerted targeting of political dissenters.<br /><br />Being an investigative journalist is not at all glamorous, but Lindorff helps the American people find out what their government is up to. Such tenacity comes in especially handy when the government does not want to voluntarily divulge theie information.	2005-08-18

A minimum wage job at a fast food restaurant is not going to work for somebody who already knows that they are capable of doing so much more.<br /><br />Because a career is something with growth and opportunities for advancement (including authority and a larger paycheck) it is critical for breaking people with disabilities out of the 'children' stereotype.<br /><br />I also liked the fact that it did acknowledge building a support network was necessary. Public schools are ideally involved in the transition, but when they cannot (or will not) recognize the independence of the job seeker/career person, making and asking supportive friends for that extra help is also important.	2005-08-17

Bush	Books	4	25	28	N	N	If you don't take charge, the inmates run the aslyum....and election	Written by a progressive, this book concedes that the Democrats failed to capitalize on the ever-growing citizen opposition to the Iraq war during the 2004 elections. After saying how badly we wanted to have Bush out of office, we failed to accomplish this on Election Day because our message became virtually indistinguishable from the Republicans.<br /><br />Although they started out good (nominating a Vet who later became an anti-war organizer) the Democratic Party became timid during the actual fall contest. Ironically as Kerry was being portrayed as a \\"Massachusetts Liberal\\" he was attempting to moderate himself. Unfortunately, this moderation was what undercut the efficacy of the campaign.<br /><br />When it became a race to see who would not say anything bad about anything having to do with the military, some voters tuned out. They supported the troops, but had wanted to hear straight talk about how the Bush administration forged evidence and wasted taxpayer money in Iraq. With the information that they were then-being given, these people had assumed that the candidates were uniformly alike and/or having Bush remain in office during a 'war' was better than attempting to change course with an 'unknown'.<br /><br />The main problem was that the Kerry campaign did not clearly articulate where and how it differed from the White House. While it is true that incumbents do have an organization advantage over their challengers, an effective challenge provides strong justification (as did the 1992 election of Bill Clinton) for a regime change.<br /><br />Then the Bush campaign proactively defined Kerry's image to the voters. Kerry spent the campaign having to tell voters who he was while he should have been able to instead talk about the issues which were going to be decided by and through the election. For all of the 'liberal bias' complaints which conservatives lodge, they were silent because this spin was benefiting their own candidate's campaign efforts.<br /><br />He also addresses the issue of third party voting as a means for American progressives to effect genuine political change, and (I feel) does a much better job than occasional Green Ralph Nader. A third party would give progressives a better chance at having their preferences heeded in the American political system. Yet, I feel that he too fails to acknowllege that a better chance is not the same as a guarantee and any elected official has to compromise with each other (including members of their own party) in order to pass a bill.<br /><br />Reading the prescriptions in this book would have been very hard immediately following Election Day 2004. I and many other progressives then felt as if something inside America had died. Because we honestly expected that Bush would loose, those results were especially frustrating. Yet, this tough love is needed so we can stop making the same mistakes and then begin creating the change which we do want to see.s.  <br /> <br />He also addresses the issue of third party voting as a means for American progressives to effect genuine political change, and (I feel) does a much better job than occasional Green Ralph Nader.

People either love him as a salt-of-the-earth personna or they see him as 'slick willie' who does and says anything to get elected, along with a runaway libido.<br /><br />Woe to the person who had wanted a genuinely objective examination of the Clinton presidency. Serious scholars were out of luck...until now.<br /><br />According to John F. Harris (who had plenty of time to study his subject while at the Washington Post), Bill Clinton is a survivor because he has withstood attacks which took down many other aspiring presidential candidates. Plus, as the first two-term Democratic president since FDR, Bill Clinton effectively proved that Democrats were not too far gone to win national elections--and office. The key was finding the right delivery system for the right message.<br /><br />The Democratic Leadership Council which he helped form and then lead blends economic and cultural moderation with traditional democratic positions---designed for appeal to southern suburban baby boomers who are perhaps the new swing voters. The 1996 re-election campaigns were a particularly interesting illustration of this effort because Clinton had to give props to groups in the Democratic Party activist base while not appearing too beholden to 'liberal special interests' which is what the Republicans had attempted to smear him with before they settled on Monica.<br /><br />Although the book was about Clinton, Harris also examined how those in the administration inner circle interacted with Clinton. Particularly interesting is the information on Hillary--the 'two for one' promise which Bill had naively uttered in 1992 apparently was not a facade with these two. The closeness with then-Vice President Al Gore seemed to be an act however; Harris's writing makes Gore to be the 'odd man out' in the administration. However, in keeping with the objective tone of this book, I found myself even more drawn to Gore because he too could thus be considered a 'survivor' in the back-slapping world of politics where the shy inadvertently become outcasts.<br /><br />Wheras concentrating on his subject's scandals would have been much easier, Harris must be commended for taking the higher (and longer) road to writing this book. His research covers both economic, social, and foregin policy agendas of the Clinton administration. Previously published works on Bill Clinton were consulted during the writing process, but the author avoided issuing a rehash in favor of a sophisticated critique.<br /><br />This book is reccomended for academic and personal libraries.

Having lived on a 21st century college campus for both my undergrad and graduate degrees, I have a very hard time believing that Seaman honestly became shocked to find the extent of what he found during his investigation of student behavior at college campuses.<br /><br />In this book he purports to be shocked by the findings and tries to pretend that his generation uniformly did not engage in similar behaviors. This position occurs throughout the book despite his generation being (thanks to the newly-created FAFSA program) the first generation to attend college enmasse. College was no longer something which was reserved for the 'rich elites' it was now something which people (in general) had to complete in order to succeed in life.<br /><br />Regardless of what he did during his own college days, Seaman should know that reality is always more complex than the pop culture images of college. I'm disappointed that he is so busy finding fault with today's college students that he cannot concede his own behaviors. I doubt that Seaman was the perfect college student in his own time. I also wonder how the thesis for this book was sold to a publisher because the 'conclusions' presented are hardly shattering.<br /><br />Even if one is not into the heavy party scene which (yes) does exist at college, ever-increasing academic requirements place considerable pressure on college students to succeed. Away from home and having to make their own personal decisions for the first time, some students do experiment with sex and drugs to attempt relieving these pressures. Again, Seaman appears gennuinely shocked that college life is not a carefree romp.<br /><br />This book might genuinely be a good reference selection for the parents whose kid is the first in their family to attend college.  It also could work for some college-educated parentswho were at EXTREMELY STRICT private colleges by providing a frank and much needed discussion about the challenges now facing their children in a freer environment.<br /><br />Many colleges (both public and private) do not embrace 'in loco parentis' any longer and thus it is the family's responsibility to encourage their student to be a responsible adult.Many colleges (both public and private) do not embrace 'in loco parentis' any longer and thus it is the family's responsibility to encourage their student to be a responsible adult.	2005-08-06

Santorum is so delusional about America that he does not acknowledge he and others in the American far right are the real problems. It really is just one big game of projection for them.<br /><br />His attempt to dissuade people from supporting women's reproductive freedom reaches new lows, even for him. Santorum thinks he's being enlightened by making an analogy to the conditions which slaves faced (p. 241), but he's actually being racist by spewing the myth of the `good' slave owner.<br /><br />His faulty analogy only shows that Santorum belittles the suffering of generations under slavery and ignores the gross contradictions of slavery having ever existed inside a democracy. Like the overt racist, the 'good slave owner' also did not recognize black people as equals, the crucial ingredients for freedom and then democracy to exist in America.<br /><br />How dare Santorum talk about ethics and conscience while trying to downplay the boundless cruelties of slavery! What was that about the GOP wanting to try and woo African American voters and their allies, now? I certainly don't feel that he has an understanding of racial inclusiveness or is sensitive to racial equality issues.<br /><br />Plus, he certainly was supportive of her right to life when his own wife underwent the so-called `partial birth abortion' procedure. What on earth is pro-family about denying other families the right to make their own decision about abortion through their own consciences?  The last time I checked, Rick Santorum was not the ruler of the world, and he was not God either.  Since the intended focus of these environments is getting facts and becoming a thoughtful educated person, I am not at all surprised that Santorum considers American public school systems `weird' (p. 386 ).<br /><br />Santorum further distinguishes himself with the pronouncement that young women who become pregnant should not get their college degrees (p. 138). Because the elimination of pregnancy/parenting restrictions is one of the VERY few things which people on both sides of reproductive politics have agreed on during the last thirty years, I am not sure what Santorum is campaigning for here  and I shudder to think of the interest groups remaining in his coalition.<br /><br />Instead of focusing on the problems which people are dealing with into the 21st century, his focus on 'weird' ideas (p. 386)  lets readers know what the far right really wants to `fix' in schools. Personally, I don't consider books to be `weird' but then again, I'm not threatened by a world where we all are different ethnicities...etc. About the only thing that Santorum is honest about in this book is that he does not like multicultural perspectives (p. 406) but, conveniently, does not actually know about what he rants against.<br /><br />The title is an obvious far right play on Hillary Clinton's own book.

Because reality did not give them what they wanted, the White House fabricated data.<br /><br />This book, written by John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton is not one of the reccent anti-Iraq war books, but it lays out the opposition to this policy in basic bare-bones langue. As such, this book is a good read for people who are not neccessarily policy wonks, but want the truth in an America of lies.<br /><br />It is convienient that one of the loudest internal anti-Saddam groups in Iraq, the Iraqi National Congress, had ties to the American Pentagon. If something like that arrangement were to happen to our country, we would be screaming bloody murder. But, because Bush had convinced the public we needed to stop 'the terrorists' wherever they were, we did not ask critical questions about the opposition sources origin and their own motives.<br /><br />Likewise, the same profession which once had helped to expose Watergate and FBI abuses against new left activists turned into the official White House parrot.

Very little has publically been made of the glaring contradictions between Bush's infamous 'mission accomplished' aircraft carrier landing and our continued presence in Iraq---ironically with no formal end to the 'mission' in sight.<br /><br />Why were we going to war with Iraq? What information prompted this decision? Who collected this information? If Saddam really was such a threat to international security, why weren't the other nations (especially his neighbors) who mourned with us over 9/11 agreeing with our plans?<br /><br />Consequently, the American people had no idea of what they were really supporting. We were only told that dissent against the country was unpatriotic and that we needed to support whatever this president did in Iraq.<br /><br />Compounding that problem, the administration went into Iraq with a distinctly western mindset. Not only did/and is still preventing Americans from being taken seriously, but it breeds terrorists who point to the 'provisional government'...etc as evidence that America only had wanted to colonize Iraq for it's own material benefit. The people working for the White House thought they were good, but they also forgot that the Iraqis and the Arab world needed to be sold on this policy to (ironically) avoid generating terrorists.<br /><br />Because the authors are pre-disposed to disagree with President Bush on other issues, this book might not have a wider audience when compared with the growing number of titles of people who were neutral or even previously supportive of the administration's Iraq policy. If Iraq really does turn into another Vietnam however, I am willing to bet that this book will suddenly find a larger audience alongside the more reccently published works.r /> <br />Consequently, the American people had no idea of what they were really supporting.

What we see on the nightly news is only a fraction of how bad things have become inside Iraq--ironically through the actions of our own government.<br /><br />A lack of planning coupled with simplistic notions about how 'we would be welcomed' by flag-waving Iraqis prevented and continues to prevent the Bush administration from making sound decision in this area. Instead of combating terrorism, we may actually even be creating it through our presence inside Iraq. Our insistence upon invading Iraq and forcing a regime change (as opposed to letting the Iraqis do it themselves) reinforces the extremist's views of America as a 21st century colonial force.<br /><br />Essentially we came in (and are remaining in Iraq) interested in what benefits America rather than seeing Iraqis as people. While reading this book, I thought how self-determination from the outset makes an all-critical difference between a democracy and a colony. For instance, America had received aid from France during the revolutionary war, but I suspect that Washington...etc would have become suspicious of and/or angry if the French had decided that they needed to set up a new government and infrastructure for us. If we would not accept such an arrangement here, we should not be acting shocked when Iraqis are demanding that it not exist in their own country.<br /><br />Chief among the offenders was provisional government head L. Paul Bremer. Against the better judgment of other officials (such as General Garner) Bremer virtually nurtured suspicion against 'democracy' inside that country with his policy decisions.<br /><br />First, he disbanded Iraq's existing military forces and followed this act with banning most Baath party members (the party which Saddam Hussein had belonged to) from holding a position in the new government, despite the fact that these members had both the cultural credibility and technical expertise which would be needed to make the 'democracy' legitimate. Supposedly these policies were undertaken to provide security measures inside Iraq, but that official explaination then undercut their own 'flag waving' fantasy.<br /><br />Bremer's policies essentially grew terrorists inside the country because the actions helped legitimize an idea that Americans were only interested in Iraq for what it could give them---oil, but did not particularly care for the Iraqi people themselves. People who lost their jobs---and hence ability to feed themselves/their family then were actually given incentive to join terrorists who were fighting against American troops. The author is not surprised that Bremer's actions ultimately created instability inside the country to a level which ironically had not existed when Hussein (for all his flaws) was in power.<br /><br />The author's background makes this work more accessible to the general public than similar works which are written by 'radicals'. However, I find it difficult to believe he was right as often as he said that he was as featured inside this book, if this really is the case--I am curious why he did not jump the sinking ship which is the Bush administration's Iraq policy much sooner. Even if policy is supposed to be made incrementally, somebody with his purported perspective in an administration brimming with 'hardliners' would not have been able to make substantial input inside this area. He would have been better off working elsewhere.<br /><br />Also, I am able to understand the acronyms and other government language which was used in this book, but somebody without any public administration training honestly might become lost during some parts. If the jargon really is necessary, an index of terms/agency names placed inside subsequent editions might help other readers keep track of the information which is being presented.se members had both the cultural credibility and technical expertise which would be needed to make the 'democracy' legitimate.

Deep Throat was the informant who provided Bob Woodward with information so he and Carl Bernstein were able to investigate Watergate where the system of checks and balances had failed to catch the Nixon administration.<br /><br />Over the years, people placed speculation on who Deep Throat really was, but only Bob Woodward knew the truth. Maintaining a source's trust, he did not reveal the identity until now.<br /><br />Mark Felt, the second-raking FBI official who had primed himself to further rise inside the government bureacracy instead became Woodward's infamous source. The book details how this duo came to trust each other over time; their Watergate information meetings were therefore not as abrupt and mysterious as Alan J. Pakula's thriller screenplay had suggested. Woodward had met and began a `relationship' with Felt years prior. On the otherhand, this book does acknowllege that many other places in the movie were more or less accurate.<br /><br />In an era where government surveillance of dissenters was still a possibility, Felt's actions were especially daring. He also was risking his life.  Because so many people in the Nixon White House felt that they were above the law, anything literally could have happened to somebody who was leaking the details of a White House connected burglary and cover up. Only six people in the world knew who this mysterious informant really was, but an entire nation ultimately benefited from his information.<br /><br />Like any informant, Felt had complex reasons for doing what he did when he did, he did not do it out of the goodness of his heart. Because their relationship faded after Watergate and Felt now claims not to remember much of what he said to Woodward. Bob Woodward continues to take the highroad in journalism by emphasizing the facts of a case rather than dwell on speculation or invent a sugar-coating for his source's motives, a rarity in our now `infotainment' obsessed media.<br /><br />Felt's not a particularly likeable or heroic character himself. Woodward delineates how the resolute character played by Hal Holbrook contrasted with the real-life person who was genuinely torn about what he was doing. However true to the book and movie, Felt did not provide the reporters with all of the information---they ultimately had to piece his provided leads together for themselves.<br /><br />It is the ultimate uncovering of the Watergate burglary and related activities which is celebrated in this text. Even this revelation is melancholy because it then had forced most people to concede that the president is not always honest with them or even a 'good person'. Such allegations were no longer the observations of partisan activists who only wanted to get their own candidate (and their own flaws) into the office instead. For all of our current-day problems with a fodder-obsessed media, I am grateful that Felt spoke out when he did on what he did.<br /><br />Bob Woodward's writing rarely disappoints audiences who expect intelligent and accessible content from their authors. This book is no exception. His writing is done from an especially intimate first-person account which balances personal opinion about the scandal with hard fact. It is a good acquisition for academic (high school-college level) and public libraries. It also is a good choice for those with interest in government and/or journalism.r his source's motives, a rarity in our now `infotainment' obsessed media.  <br /> <br />Felt's not a particularly likeable or heroic character himself.

Because I had inadvertently assumed myself and other people who did this somehow 'failed' at having friends, this book provided critical reassurance.<br /><br />The end to a friendship can come suddenly, as in the result of a heated argument, or it can develop over time, like high school friends who move away from their hometown to attend college or school friends who move apart and 'forget' to write to each other. Even if nothing intentionally provokes the development, some things just cannot be sustained indefinitely. Letting go of a friendship which drifts away is much healthier than attempting to sustain it for appearances sake.<br /><br />Because I have had several friendships end in my own lifetime, I appreciated the frank monologues inside this book. There was not anything which we could have done to save the friendship and a friendship's end does not mean that either one of us were bad people to another. It's just something that happens throughout life.<br /><br />I sporadically still think about many of my former friends, and wonder if they also remember the good times which we had shared at a mutual point in our lives. However, I also recognize that because we are presently in different places-- both geographically and mentally--our friendship would not necessarily rekindle itself were we to again meet up. Even assuming that we would be able to work everything out, we would then have to start the relationship over.<br /><br />I usually do not like self-help or advice books, but this book avoids nagging in favor of real answers to common problems. Plus, it does not blame the women whose friendships end.	2005-07-30

But it's not a tell-all revenge tome either. It's the saga how the desire to create a successful toyline (largely to compensate for their Star Wars failure) subsequently gave birth to He-man.<br /><br />The cartoons which I had grown up with, for how well the animation specs were at that point in time, were themselves nothing more than a vehicle to sell toys. The 'moral' lesson at the end of each episode was placed to provide 'some redeeming value' for the kids who were the primary audience of this series. They wanted to tell television watchdogs that their series really did have socially redeeming value.<br /><br />This book also explains that today's fad is only tommorrow's has been. By the late 1980's, He-Man was not a marketable comodity anymore; the show was pulled from the air and the toys were shelved.<br /><br />I was later initially excited to hear there would be a 'new adventures of He-Man' series, but cringed when I saw it was a futuristic space theme and had nothing to do with what I grew up watching. Reading this book and remembering the thankfully-brief series, I am curious if the 'space version' I saw actually had been one of those original prototypes.<br /><br />I am hoping that the author is thankful that he picked the friendly-barbarian prototype because at least he made money of of one He-man idea.	2005-07-30

Carter argues that George Wallace might be one of the more influential politicians in American history. He showed conservatives that racist rhetoric was a vote getter and that southern discontent over the civil rights movement could be mined for election to national office.<br /><br />Carter is a professor of history at Emory University whose research interests are southern politics. His previous works include The Politics of Rage, which solely studies George Wallace's subconscious and enduring legacy on southern politics. It shows that Carter knows his research in this still-troubling field.<br /><br />The Nixon campaign took careful notes of Wallace's 1968 and 1972 attempts because white racists subsequently became one of the groups backing the 1972 Nixon campaign. The Nixon campaign had marketed themselves as a return to simpler times, when everything was 'good'. Ignoring the sociolegal realities for most Americans, this approach then virtually presented civil rights policies as an encroachment upon that social standard.<br /><br />The southern strategy also implied that African Americans themselves were responsible for the resulting social disorder in their communities and had actually been making trouble where there initially was none. Blaming the victim was a convienient way to ignore long-festering racial problems and win elections in the south. It also yielded national election wins for the GOP in the once-solid south.<br /><br />The Republicans would exploit racial fears again during the 1988 campaign. Lee Atwater, Bush Sr's campaign manager ran a campaign against Michael Dukakis which ultimately elevated racist campaigning to an unprecedented level. Willie Horton was a convicted criminal who had committed a rape and armed robbery while he was out on a Massachusetts weekend release program.<br /><br />\\"Independent\\" television campaign ads supporting Bush emphasized that Willie Horton was a black man. The idea was to 'scare' white voters into believing that Horton would rape their families and/or themselves. Dukakis's election as president would have 'presumably' allowed black men across the country to run around raping whomever they wanted.<br /><br />Ironically, Dukakis was portrayed as a flaming liberal while he was centrist in comparison to the competing presidential campaign of Jessie Jackson. Both he and Dukakis's running mate, Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen publically called the ads 'racist'.<br /><br />Finally, welfare reform occurred in 1996 because conservative Republicans were long-convinced that 'welfare queens' were abusing the system and were able to convince voters of the stereotypes. Again, the play to racism paid off for the right. Many of the conservative Republicans who were elected in 1994 were more conscious of their need to appear publicly 'inclusive' than was the Wallace-Nixon generation, but they also did race baiting. Carter concedes that President Clinton (who was a moderate Democrat)did sign that same 'welfare reform' measure, but his analysis focuses on how the Congressional Republicans had such an easy time attacking this program.<br /><br />The Republican Party is now trying to make public overtures out to the African American community. They are publicly repudiating the ethics of the southern strategy as described in Carter's book because it in effect has demonized blacks for votes. Yet, because the strategy was/is wildly successful garnering votes, the GOP is in an ethical bind. Do they forfeit something which they know is a proven vote-getter or do they try to take the high road and imagine what Abraham Lincoln would have done in the 21st century.

Pillow uses qualitative and quantitative data to examine America's ongoing teen pregnancy problem. The only western nation without comprehensive sex education, America also boasts a dubious distinction of having the western world's highest teen pregnancy rate.<br /><br />Teen pregnancy became noticed as an individual demographic-specific problem in the 1960's, but different races were and have always been treated differently in America when they find themselves pregnant.<br /><br />White women were historically regarded as having made a 'bad choice', but ultimately were redeemable (through the intervention of moralistic social service personnel) only if they sequestered themselves in maternity homes. Here they could become 'repaired' through a strict regimen of religion and vocational training, while they were supposed to ultimately find a man---their having a child allegedly limited marriage ability. Later on, some homes would even offer adoption services, allowing the woman to further `erase' the teenage pregnancy and have a second chance at respectability.<br /><br />Contrasting, black teenage pregnancies became cited as `evidence' of that community's problems and consequently were left to their own devices. Black teenagers traditionally were supposed to turn to their own for assistance.<br /><br />Although teens are no longer kicked out of school for becoming pregnant (Title IX), they are instead being handed many punitive options by our government. The same entities who do not give them access to information about preventing a pregnancy then appear to constantly remind them that their options are limited once they are pregnant. This compounds the sense of isolation which those young women have.<br /><br />What daycare and social service programs exist for teens is not enough to meet the demand. The American government historically and currently does not want to make the social policy investitures required for having actual social change.  Connaught `Connie' Marshner was a Reagan administration political appointment to head the office of family life, but she actually knew very little about the program which she was supposed to direct. Marshner was soon replaced by somebody with more related experience, but that 1980's incident is emblematic of how little priority the government gave to seriously addressing and then ending teen pregnancy. If bureaucracies ultimately function through expertise only, the first appointment never was actually going to address teen pregnancy. Rather it was going to reinforce ideological stereotypes about `promiscuous youth' and 'values'; 'good people' allegedly did not have teen pregnancies.<br /><br />The 'promiscuous low-income youth' myth reared its head in the 1990's with welfare reform. Welfare reform itself was built on the assumption that young women of color were becoming rich from having litters of babies, selectively ignoring the actual payment levels pre-reform, which were not enough to live above poverty anywhere inside this country. The sexuality of black women ultimately provided sufficient ammunition for politicians to attack the welfare state, even Democratic president Bill Clinton had endorsed and signed the measure.<br /><br />She also includes information on Hispanic young women. By virtue of being people of color they are also being victimized through race-sexuality dichotomies and additionally face language barriers while trying to obtain social services. The thrust of the book's racial-ethnic focus is centered on the black-white politics of sex, teen pregnancy, and poverty. Since 19th century miscegenation laws were first enacted, black sexuality has terrified public policymakers as alternately being both inferior and effectively destructive to the country.<br /><br />Identifying many connotations within the term `epidemic' Pillow concedes that American teen pregnancy rates will not substantially decline until we begin having honest talks. Our country needs to talkhow current policies are/have been fundamentally race-gender-socioeconomic constructed and then we can adopt a more inclusive approach to sexuality education.talks.

As president and Publisher of Congressional Quarterly and a former Wall Street Journal reporter, Robert Merry is closely acquainted with government trappings.<br /><br />Even European democracies have cultural nuances from the American model. Attempting to require conformity to 'our' way of doing things only engenders suspicion, distrust, and then hatred. We should then not be surprised when the nations rebel against 'Colonial Democracy' or why. Our desire to control other countries earns us the moniker of 'bully'.<br /><br />Those people only want the right to have their own nation run by their own cultural values, a standard which had ironically founded America. Our 'missteps' in the middle east actually provide further justification for the anti-American sentiment; we are then living up to what their culture previously had said about American democracy and Americans.<br /><br />Reading this book I thought about the 1960's cold war. We were then-attempting to convince 'third world' nations that embracing American democracy was the right move for security and prosperity. We became locked into the Vietnam War because our then-government did not want Southeast Asia to have a communist form of government. We were also condescending to those nations because we earnestly had believed that America knew what was best for everybody else in the world.<br /><br />Sadly, I must concede that the current administration (including a PhD Secretary of State) has not absorbed those lessons--or read this book. Merry explicitly writes about the current fiasco in Iraq and the Middle East, but he invokes American and world histories to demonstrate the ultimate timelessness of his thesis.	2005-07-10

This is because America is a fundamentally liberal country.<br /><br />We have just let conservatives define what being a liberal is instead of constantly being proactive and doing it ourselves. Self-marketing gives people an honest picture of who we are and what we believe--liberals are the American mainstream. After the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon television debates we got cocky and forgot the importance of presentation to winning public offices.<br /><br />He is also eerily accurate with his personal assessment of some campaign/party office conditions (pp. 189-191). Having the best party platform and the best issue positions in the world does not mean much for prospective voters when they are actually being cut down by self-absorbed individual party officials and/or find out the party has headquartered itself in something looking like the `end' frame in a disaster movie.<br /><br />Having had my own experiences with such conditions, I completely agree. I can see where it does turn off an independent voter or a prospective party activist who is not committed enough about politics to then stay with the Democrats. There are some things an organization which cannot skimp on because image does matter to mission success. Even `nice' people cannot compensate for having a dilapidated office. A clean well-maintained office ultimately convinces voters that we will also keep government in a similar condition if elected.<br /><br />Rall praises Clinton for some positions, but he also attacks the Democratic Leadership Council for trying to mimic the Republicans electoral success without first understanding where they had succeeded (pp. 153-182) or why. He also points out that the GOP has not moderated their tone in return, instead strengthening it.<br /><br />At the same time, Rall forgets his own earlier advice about looking beyond stereotypes when he tries to talk about the feminist movement. Here Rall actually plays into the hands of people who want to believe that liberalism is bizzare.<br /><br />He inadvertently undercuts the sincerity of his own organizing credo with an attack on Patricia Ireland, former president of the National Organization for Women, because of her sexuality (pp. 65-66). Rall is visibly obsessed with both her sexuality and the consequent `implications' for the feminist movement, she allegedly discredits us all only because some conservatives stereotype every feminist as a lesbian. He then expresses a preference for the earlier NOW, an irony given that the 1966 organization was much closer to the `republican lite' model which he claims to despise in other chapters of this same book.<br /><br />Rall's book has some good points, but it is not flawless.

The left cannot prepare for the future without first understanding what it has previously accomplished and how those victories were won. Specific dates refer to the cold-war era, but the lessons inside Mattson's book are applicable today.<br /><br />Both in reaction to the domestic excesses of Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist crusade and the recent memory of international facism, liberals argued that we needed a better approach-and they would provide it. Civil rights was not a threat to America, but a demonstration of the democratic system at its very best. While some policy makers did not have identical personal motives for supporting this cause, they publically talked about an America where people were united by their commonalities rather than being torn apart by their differences.<br /><br />Civil rights policy consequently became possible and at a pace which was rapid-fire when compared with the successes of previous generations. Measures which had languished for years were passed, albeit not without some struggle of their own.<br /><br />However, public legislator opposition to civil rights bills ultimately became viewed as being a hold-out to progress and a `great America' rather than functioning as a preservation measure.<br /><br />Today there is not a politician on `either side of the aisle' who would directly attack the Civil Rights Acts directly; the American political landscape has effectively changed that through liberalism. Segregation is no longer an acceptable tradition for mainstream American political parties.<br /><br />The post-war politicians who had passed the integration and other measures instinctively understood that the country would do better only when the masses did better.  Welfare, good schools, social security, and public housing therefore were not extras but essential tools to securing the nation. People who were not needy then had a greater chance of working together for a better country. These politicians had honestly seen a utopia where the best in people was an attainable outcome rather than impossibility.<br /><br />There would always be a criminal element in society, but this segment was minimal. The overwhelming majority of people shared a desire to be responsible and productive citizens. Some people just needed help reaching that goal. Once they had reached that goal, they also would begin giving back to their society.<br /><br />What a refreshing political philosophy compared against today's '24 hour news era' when people of all political ideologies distrust each other ironically while talking about how they are in politics `for the folks'. Today's public officials certainly are more technologically advanced than their predecessors, but this book makes it clear that another generation was much more politically advanced.merican political parties.  <br /> <br />The post-war politicians who had passed the integration and other measures instinctively understood that the country would do better only when the masses did better.

It is useful for individuals who are investigating Wicca as a religion, but it is especially helpful for the potentially confused (and scared) friends and family.<br /><br />An avalanche of stereotypes and misinformation in this society about what Wicca is and who Wiccans are subsequently leaves the friends and families of the practitioners in a bind. They might want to be supportive, but those family members and friends do not necessarily know where to turn for affirming information. Despite Wicca being recognized as a religion (by institutions such as the United States military!) accurate information about Wicca remains to find.<br /><br />The tone of this book is open-minded, Lankford is able to empathize with his readers own path. He is an advanced witch but does not forget that potential readers and readers are entering with a dearth of information about this religion. Pulling rank on them would have been easy but he is instead empathetic to their own journey towards acceptance of friends, family, and themselves.	2005-06-27

In fact, Diamond became involved with Iraq first-hand because of those infamous connections. In politics, its not necessarily what you know, but who you know.<br /><br />Despite his own educational/regional shortcomings for working in Iraq, Diamond agreed to join the American-installed Coalition Provisional Authority. The CPA ultimately would come under physical and verbal fire for being little more than a polite way of saying 'American colonial regime'. We were theoretically advocating freedom for the Iraqi people, but tellingly preventing them from actual self-governance.<br /><br />Indeed L. Paul Bremer and the other Americans only appeared interested in themselves and could not be bothered to critically think about the many consequences of their own actions. An instinctive tendency to discount critical thinking throughout their occupation consequently prevented the CPA from making many decisions which actually would have benefited the same population which they were publicly claiming to serve in the best interests of.<br /><br />Although I honestly believe that Diamond must take responsibility for some of the subsequent blunders in Iraq, I still found considerable merit in charges raised throughout his book. His personal background makes this book a definite cut above other recent books on Iraq which take a decidedly partisan tone.<br /><br />The fact that a Bush administration buddy now is so candid about what has really happened in post-Saddam Iraq is very encouraging. Recognizing his mistakes (and the deaths which they have caused), he now is trying to get other people to see the light.	2005-06-25

Once again Coontz (The way we never were, The way we really are) delves beyond simplistic pop culture/political sound bites to deliver an infinitely more complex portrait of American family life. This time she tackles marriage.<br /><br />Because marriage has traditionally been about possession of property (the woman and her family's ownings) today's pop culture promotion of marriage as a partnership of equals is VERY new. It is not at all traditional in the actual historical sense.<br /><br />People who are eager to restrict same sex marriage might want to reconsider after they learn what had previously been restricted throughout American history. Interracial, inter-religious, and the unions of people with disabilities were all once barred under 'protection' guises of their day.<br /><br />We endorse a very selective and unrealistic history of marriage whenever we avoid recognition of these histories. It is easy to support marriage restrictions until we have to concede that we might ourselves be discriminated by a genuinely 'traditional' institution. Today's attempts to ban same sex marriage only carry on the tradition of fear and division rather than affirming the institution itself.<br /><br />Coontz delves into disturbing histories, but this book is completely readable. Like her previous works, this book is accessible; the scholar, community activist, and general audiences all will find this title a very informative work.<br /><br />We cannot discuss the tradition of marriage without first actually conceding that this institution has previously changed and then what adherence to tradition really would mean for the country.	2005-06-24

Even by the standards of other anti-Hillary books, Klein's work is embarrassing. It attempts to pretend that our presidential candidates and presidents got where they were without exerting ambition.<br /><br />If the 'evidence' inside this book were actual legitimate criteria for excluding people from the presidency, there would not be a presidency period.<br /><br />The even-smaller number of people who still ran would not do ANYTHING to differentiate each other for fear of being 'ambitious'. The candidate similarities which my generation laments now would become greatly increased and American society consequently would stagnate.<br /><br />Outside of elementary school, most people realize that any political candidate has to have substantial ambition to win an election. Running a campaign is not 'nicey-nicey' for anybody at any time. Even a so-called 'easy' campaign is time-consuming and stress-level taxing on candidates<br /><br />If Klein wants to make a substantial contribution to American public affairs, he would first do better to realize how the system actually works. It does not matter if the candidate is Republican, Democrat, or other, they need to have ambition to survive the election cycle.<br /><br />Then if he still disagreed with the inherent need for candidate ambition, Klein could write a book attacking that instead of trying to see things in the current American political system which do not exist. Hilarious as this read was, it does not provide accurate information.	2005-06-24

Prior to reading this book, I was bouncing from temp job to temp job with only a vague idea of 'winning resume'.<br /><br />I knew how to write a CV, but apparently did not know what made other types shine. When I had to leave my current job because of money issues, I knew that I could not afford to remain in the dark any longer. I had to get a resume writing guide and study it closely.<br /><br />This book readily stood out from other titles which I flipped through. It showed me that a resume only needs to have stuff which is directly related to the position which I am applying to.<br /><br />Because I am a visual learner, I appreciated the endless parade of sample resumes in this book; resumes should be both personal and professional.  I finally learned that being creative with my resume was okay if I felt comfortable that my end result would be conducive to a job offer. A resume is only a 'calling card' and does not guarantee your job.	2005-06-09

No cash cows existed for these women, they were at the bottom rungs of an 'affluent' society.<br /><br />She argues that big corporations receive their own welfare in the form of tax subsidies. However because they are rich in a capitalist society championing the accumulation of wealth as success, we are not supposed to view this arrangement as being 'lazy' or 'lacking a work ethic'. Attacking low-income women who cannot write a multimillion dollar check is considered politically safer.<br /><br />Funiciello is also wary of liberals who claim to support welfare mothers, but are too busy talking about themselves to hear the women themselves(pp. 212-255). She takes the Catholic Church to task for claiming to organize against poverty, while it is simultaneously one of the country's largest land holders (p. 226-227) and now appears more interested in self-preservation than alleviating human suffering. She also dislikes non-profits which don't eliminate poverty, but somehow are eager to have that one additional charity ball where they can don diamonds and eat caviar.<br /><br />Funiciello believes that it is the American system itself which puts American women and children in poverty. She is savvy enough to recognize that some so-called 'do-gooders' whose own income depends on working in anti-poverty programs are not eager for a real socioeconomic revolution to occur. Then these 'colleagues' would have to see Funiciello and her sisters as activist equals instead of victims or cases. Even some social workers who started out with good intentions became burnt out from their own time spent trying to decipher the mysteries of American social services.<br /><br />Contrasting, Funiciello's social justice calls for a universal guaranteed income which would prevent people from becoming poor. Funiciello says the success of this program would ultimately rest on initial and subsequent program appropriations, but provides European evidence to document these programs do work and people do not stop working with a guaranteed adequate income (pp. 300-302).<br /><br />Instead, it can actually open up paid job hours for more people in a society (pp. 304-305) and eliminate the corrupted social service professionals from the field by virtue of a greatly reduced clientele base.<br /><br />Funiciello also provides a concise synopsis of inner-city and older suburban neighborhood deterioration. Neighborhoods do not simply deteriorate on their own, the best and brightest in a community move away from an area which they sense is becoming neglected and those who cannot move away are left to attempt muddling through as best they can. The closure of stores and banks inadvertently prompts some of those remaining people to legitimize the underground economy as being their only means for survival.<br /><br />Funiciello writes on a very timely topic with focused indignation. Her personal convictions are based upon experience, but she recognizes the dangers of drowning arguments in emotion.  Because this book lacks an index, the prospective reader must commit to reading the entirety of this title and will find it very difficult to 'jump' around in the text.ent program appropriations, but provides European evidence to document these programs do work and people do not stop working with a guaranteed adequate income (pp. 300-302).

He wants to quickly and easily distinguish himself from the social conservatives (religious and otherwise) who bemoan an oversexualized media----and then use their public support to attempt shuttering women back into our homes allegedly where we all belong. Thankfully, Boteach has a different agenda.<br /><br />Sex sells in America, and this co modification ultimately harms both sexes; we see each other as being possessions to be acquired and used rather than partners and equals. Women however, have historically borne the brunt of this mistreatment and (when compared against world/American history) have only been allowed into the public sphere. He deals with a grim subject matter, but Boteach is optimistic that society can and will change.<br /><br />I believe that his desire to reach all people with this book is the only reason why Boteach focused on popular culture as opposed to religious images as also oppressing women. Considering this author has lots to say on many issues, a religious perspective on this issue might provide good material for another book.<br /><br />This book was very readable and actually did give me new things to think about.	2005-06-09

People from all over the political spectrum are eager to claim the 16th president as one of them, and the Illinois politician has since assumed a larger-than-life persona.<br /><br />Although Lincoln is the nation's first official Republican president, he earned reverence among generations of African Americans (who would vote Republican until the 1960's) for emancipation. Musician Dion even enshrined him (along with Dr. King and the Kennedy's) into a somber Parthenon of 'great Americans who fought on behalf of civil rights' for a still-catchy song.<br /><br />Lind produced a general book about Lincoln, but this book contains large sections on Lincoln's views on race and ethnicity. As progressive as he was on some issues, Lincoln was still a product of his own time. Lind even goes as far to suggest that Lincoln was personally sympathetic to white supremacists. Because such an image would be at considerable odds with how the American public would like to remember him, this book raises some troubling questions about \\"American heroes\\". Can we really continue identifying with Lincoln if we do not actually know about his political ideology and issue positions?<br /><br />While this book was an interesting read, Lind's research leaves something to be desired. His miscalculation of the senators and representatives during Lincoln's presidency is appalling. Lind is not aware that the figure he had given in this book was too large for the time. Finally, he appears to have his own made up version of who Lincoln really was.  Lind has a demagogue's penchant for simply ignoring prior substantiated historical evidence which discredits his thesis.	2005-06-08

The downside is that working for the public good necessitates tight budgets. Changing the world IS expensive, but can be done with thoughtful planning.<br /><br />Sharply at odds with a 'fat cat' image of politics, the non profit MUST know how to make the most use of their organization's resources in order to remain relevant to their service area and organization mission statements. Reading this book reminded me of an organization I had worked with because they started out with noble intentions, but ultimately folded only because the other staff did not understand the necessity of budgeting or how non-profits differ from private-sector corporate charity initiatives.<br /><br />I'm sure that Dabel has his own horror stories of an organization which forgot to balance idealism with fiscal prudence, but such reminiscing is not the focus of this book. Instead, Dabel provides simple, ready-to-do steps which most non-profits can and should easily undertake. The best organization committed to the best cause in the world will be ineffective when it does not have money for campaign supplies or even an organizing space.<br /><br />Although he does mention the role which volunteers and interns can play in advancing an organization's goals while lowering the economic overhead, Dabel did not appear to fully appreciate their potential range of contributions in an organization. Having both been an intern and then worked at numerous non-profit organizations where paid staff topped out around 4 people, I ardently believe that unpaid work cannot be underestimated as being one of those practical solutions.<br /><br />Overall however, this was a good book. I would feel comfortable recommending it to both the non-profit co-worker/colleague and people (such as my family) who need a jargon-free book on the economic/social work environments of non-profits.	2005-06-08

Instead of writing a frenzied treatise why the right is bad, Lisa McGirr lets readers draw conclusions from her fact-based historical analysis.<br /><br />The suburban new right emerged in the 1950's and early 1960's out of a desire for self-preservation. People in these newly emergent suburbs were alternating between the 'self-reliant' model of conservative libertarianism and 'big-government' social conservatism which placed its premiums on social and political conformity as a tool for ensuring order in the community. The then cold war united the two periodically disparate strains of conservatism into a unified school of thought; conformity was good for national security.<br /><br />Because it upheld the values which they supported (and felt were in the best benefit for America) the people who would become part of the New Right honestly did not mind when they and/or their companies received economic subsidies from the government. They had to defend the country against the reds after all. This was not mooching off the system, but ensuring the country would be able to produce the best resources and the brightest people to outmatch 'the reds'.<br /><br />The 'red-baiting' and 'race-baiting' which I and other people have publicly and psychologically associated with the right only came into existence when the status quo was being threatened.<br /><br />The same people who had not protested (and in fact welcomed) government benefits for themselves became genuinely anxious upon realizing that the civil rights movement was attempting to reconfigure the American state to offer more benefits to more groups of people. This exposed contradictions in the American state as it currently existed and hinted that a reconfigured American state would not provide exactly the same order of things as they had known it to exist.<br /><br />Fearful of these 'other' people, some southern states undertook the-then shocking action of voting for Barry Goldwater in 1964, disrupting the solidly Democratic south. Prior to this time, a southerner voting Republican was unthinkable. The party of Lincoln after all was responsible for both emancipation and reconstruction.<br /><br />Although Goldwater would loose to Johnson, his candidacy and campaign positions (including against the civil rights act) further laid the foundations for the present day situation. Voting shifts in the 1964 presidential election ultimately encouraged the Reagan revolution of the 1980's and George W. Bush's promotion of faith based initiatives today.southern states undertook the-then shocking action of voting for Barry Goldwater in 1964, disrupting the solidly Democratic south.

Prayer in addition to other treatments is one thing, but to proclaim that prayer itself is supposed to cure women is scary stuff.<br /><br />Honestly, the first time I attempted to read through this title, I believed that it was a joke. I was concerned when I subsequently learned this was an administration pick for the advisory committee on reproductive health drugs for the Food and Drug Administration. This quack is actually in a prominent position to affect the well-being of myself and many other women in America.<br /><br />I am concerned that the Bush administration takes such an approach to women's health, but (tellingly) feels that conventional medicine is good enough for men. If the faith based perspective in this book was good enough to apply to women's bodies, Hager ought to be applying the same standard to men.<br /><br />Hager's very selective ideas of what is 'good treatment' reveal this doctor ultimately prescribes a bad prescription.  Hager pointedly markets himself as a Christian physician, but since most of the Christians I am friends with also strike a balance between their own religious practice and the personal conscience and health of others, I am honestly not sure what to categorize him as.<br /><br />He does not want to acknowledge that his particular brand of Christianity does not work for every person, and could even be medically inappropriate as a treatment itself in some cases which are ironically described in this book.<br /><br />Still, this book does have some redemptive value. Give it to a medical student/doctor to encourage their serious practice of medicine while reminding them of what a good doctor  ultimately is NOT.	2005-05-12

We are still dealing with both issues today, but their attempts to connect oppressions (note Milk's now dated use of the term 'handicapped' and take it with a grain of salt) speaks to our own generation of radical political activists. We cannot prioritize oppressions and we cannot afford to sidestep what is going on in our communities lest it offend somebody else.<br /><br />In her \\"A letter to ma\\" Merle Woo talks about how liberation does in fact involve the simultaneous recognition of various oppressions. She is trying to show her mother that her new consciousness as an activist does not negate family or culture and actually affirms the intersecting experiences, thus reinforcing pride in both her parents. Her raised consciousness has given her a new appreciation for the hardships which her parents endured in their own lives, and she wants them to know how much they are now loved.  Ordering social justice movements is impossible because we cannot similarly order our demographic components. They are literally us.<br /><br />I'm appreciating the dissent in Bowers v. Hardwick, and the majority ruling in Romer v. Evans, but I am wondering if those Supreme Court rulings really should be considered part of GLBT liberation as an explicitly separate movement from the more mainstream GLBT rights. I've read the cases, and these opinions do not endorse the liberation movement's goal to create a new society; the justices pointedly are cautious to emphasize they cite existing law.<br /><br />On the other hand, the inclusion of these justices might convince otherwise wavering people that `gay liberation' is good and should also be part of their own belief system.<br /><br />While there are other more comprehensive GLBT political anthologies on the market, this book still makes a nice introduction because of the care which went into selecting the essays for the compact size.

Baker cuts through both the media and pop-politics hype to argue that America has not lost its values and we are not subsequently headed for trouble. Having waded through the ever-growing mountain of criticism about values, I was pleased by Baker's fresh approach to this enduring policy question.<br /><br />His comparative international study argues that the values argument and related campaigns are nothing more than a very elaborate `smoke and mirrors' arrangement which is designed to play on public insecurity and lack of complete information how America fares against itself and other nations.<br /><br />The success of the culture war can ultimately be attributed to the fact that emotional charge can successfully get people riled up and against each other over actually nothing. \\"They\\" are doing the right thing, but people then worry that their neighbors are somehow doing something `different' from their own actions.<br /><br />Baker's evidence from religion, psychology, and sociology presents a rational argument that our values are just fine as they are, thank you.<br /><br />The overall absurdity of the `declining values' argument against this strong research package has not prevented politicians from using `values' charges and statements inside their own campaigns however.<br /><br /> They have practically campaigned on `restoring values' even though we cannot fix something which is not already broken.  Yet, Baker suggests that the politicians and candidates (who also live in this society) may not have access to the truth either. They may also honestly not realize that everything is in fact okay.<br /><br />This truly non-partisan approach makes Baker's research much more substantial than a tome written by an individual/foundation with a specific political ideology. Baker can concede that nobody has a monopoloy on 'good values' but America is not a repository for 'bad values' either. Because wallowing in partisan muck has been proven much easier (including for book sales and media hype) Baker himself is a paragon of values.<br /><br />Finally, the emotional grasp of `values' on the American psyche is so effectively bipartisan that politicians from both political parties campaign to this imagined crisis. The success of the DLC (who had also endorsed v-chips) and the 2000 Democratic ticket of Gore/Lieberman (which talked about their own belief in values in an attempt to offset the Republicans) also demonstrate that the Democrats were equally anxious to campaign on `restoring values' in America.<br /><br />Baker's research is a necessary acquisition for both academic libraries and personal collections. It is a must read for politicians from all points on the political spectrum so we can finally move onto problems which do exist in America.tisan muck has been proven much easier (including for book sales and media hype) Baker himself is a paragon of values.   <br /> <br />Finally, the emotional grasp of `values' on the American psyche is so effectively bipartisan that politicians from both political parties campaign to this imagined crisis.

Deckman delivers readers a fresh new portrait of the Christian right which, although still critical of their ultimate end goals, wants to understand how they were able to achieve their successes or not.<br /><br />Differing from the organizational research reports and partisan titles which already flood the market, Deckman's book has readers instead consider why the religious right enjoys so much electoral success even if a majority of American voters do not formally appear to support their ideas.<br /><br />She then wants us to consider how waging a campaign/counter campaign against these candidates and public officials is literally impossible when we actually do not know about the people who we want to run against.<br /><br />The thesis of Deckman's book is that both sides in a community demonize each other in the process of school board and local elections in an attempt to win support from undecided voters. The Christian right is at once both more similar and more complex than previous attack campaigns/counter-responses publicly have conceded. Articulating this complex nature will then enable myself and others to win more campaigns and more effectively sell our own policies to that swing public.<br /><br />Starting out with wanting to make major change, the Christian right candidates and/or elected officials subsequently are required to alter their grand world views in order to be a part of the system which they ultimately seek to change. Built on compromise, the American political system is subsequently not receptive to radical changes which these people (and other candidates) would like to make. Our campaign portrayals of these people might therefore indicate what they would like to do, but it does not actually acknowledge what they are permitted to do; held in check by the American government's system of checks and balances.<br /><br />Deckman's data includes case studies of elections held in Fairfax County Virginia and Garret County Maryland. These case studies prove that although they share some important group characteristics and goals, not all Christian right campaigns and then the candidates who run them are virtual `carbon copies' of each other. A vulnerability to internal dissent among various religious right candidates and office holders further lessens their being the `mighty boogeyman' of political jargon.<br /><br />She also suggests that both the `far right' candidates and my beloved liberal counterparts are much more alike than we actually are different. The research in this book uncovers that non-religious right school board candidates are also likely to be religiously affiliated and also are more likely to come from the community elite---who can afford to run in an election and hold public office. We have more in common with each other than we have previously thought and/or let on in campaigns and debates.<br /><br />Although I also read the more conventional broadsides against the right, and tend to agree with the left, Deckman's book is a critical step for defeating Christian right candidates.n Fairfax County Virginia and Garret County Maryland.

Our formal declarations of `equal opportunity' are undercut by the cultural reality of racist social policy. Like Dorothy Roberts, she argues that gender and racial hierarchies intersect to specifically disadvantage black women.<br /><br />Unlike Robert's earlier work, this book goes all the way back to the emancipation era and covers many more issue areas beyond reproduction. When the federal government has intervened for racial equality, it has only done so in periods which are relatively fleetingly in comparison to the magnitude of the problem.<br /><br />Williams has her most provocative research in a chapter on the black community's consistent support for President Bill Clinton (1993-2001). Blacks had consistently supported the Clinton administration at levels which easily overshadowed the total support simultaneously received from white voters. Although she does not provide a detailed analysis of intra- African American socioeconomic issues, Williams does ask us to consider how goals and stereotypes subtly but pervasively co-exist in public policy programs.<br /><br />Those ultimately racialized voter patterns were established and then further solidified even as Clinton signed `welfare reform' which specifically built off the specter of the `welfare queen'; a presumably African American woman who lived off of the government instead of having a `job' and then raising her kids `right'.  Ironically, before the federal welfare program became racially integrated in the 1960's, the white welfare recipients were intentionally supposed to stay at home with their children and not work outside of the home specifically so that their children would grow up `right'.<br /><br />Williams correctly recognizes that any `universal' public policy does fact take on racial connotations because of our society's fundamentally racialized nature. People who prefer the status quo (and the ensuing racial constructs) are not going to be happy with a program which then attempts to equalize the playing field for all Americans. Talking about democracy is one thing, but sharing it with somebody who looks different from the self still makes many Americans and our public officials uncomfortable in spite of their `tolerant' public demeanor.<br /><br />This book is an essential read for people studying race/ethnicity, but I also think it needs to be at the top of public administration reading lists. Conceeding that public policy is not value neutral is the first step in making a society which truly is equal.ions because of our society's fundamentally racialized nature.

People honestly believing that they are also included in the 'beneficiaries' of a conservative policy are not necessarily going to stop and read the very fine print.<br /><br />But, it's the fine print which catches the 'everybody else' every single time. Conservative politicians talk about 'common people's lives' because they have learned this is what brings in the votes, but they remain as detached and self-absorbed as ever. They still want a majority of the wealth concentrated in a compact segment.<br /><br />A key strength of Massey's work is that it recognizes the power of economic systems to bring about political and social transformation. Viewing markets as autonomous entities apart from politics ultimately proves disastrous and we need to be articulating how our world view will ultimately benefit other people in 'concrete ways' inside their own daily lives.	2005-05-06

Imagining what a world without vaccines was like is very chilling.<br /><br />Coupled with then-constructions about people with disabilities and medical technology limitations, the specter of polio captured the imaginations and fears of whole communities. During the summer months, people were advised to be very careful about where they swam unless they too had wanted to end up with polio. The March of Dimes inadvertently helped to publicize people with disabilities even while the thrust of their founding campaign against Polio was eradication of the disease through a vaccine.<br /><br />The development of that vaccine brings us into 1954, approximately 10 years after Roosevelt's own death. Jonas Salk made America's first polio vaccine using a killed-virus sample, and this product remained a virtual favorite for many years afterward. Although Albert Sabin's live-virus vaccination soon became the preferred model, it says a lot that the Salk product has reemerged to finally conquer polio once and for all.<br /><br />Because society naturally has a tendency to anoint public figures and thus remove them from having any flaw, I actually did appreciate his research into the personal character traits of the scientists. Although these men ultimately helped to save America, they were personally imperfect. I feel this humanizing approach makes them more accessible figures to me and other readers.<br /><br />Presidential action from FDR was instrumental in encouraging the eradication of polio in America.  Now as this highly-readable book is released, the United Nations has set an equally ambitious goal of eradicating the world of polio by 2008.	2005-05-06

Whereas it was once scandalous for GLBT people to meet publicly, many 'mainstream' institutions such as Disney sponsor gay days, if nothing else to demonstrate their own 'inclusivity' and gain money from this community.<br /><br />Because coming out is such a common event today, myself and other generation xers (regardless of our own sexuality) may inadvertently dismiss the revolutionary impact these declarations of self had for the generations of Americans who were conditioned to believe that GLBT and 'well adjusted' were essentially contradictions in terms.<br /><br />Gays and lesbians were not the lonely mysterious stranger but friends, neighbors, and coworkers. Any depression which these individuals experienced because of sexuality was the result of society intoning negative self-esteem messages rather than the 'natural' state of being.<br /><br />Walters's book is also important because she traces how a rise in GLBT visibility (although not the same as equality) has prompted a backlash. The right wing vociferously campaigns against gay rights in today's environment because the greater cultural visibility has effectively undone their own world. Whatever they actually think of GLBT rights, now having to acknowledge that GLBT people exist is a very uncomfortable development.<br /><br />Prior to Stonewall, these people and their predecessors were effectively enabled to pretend that GLBT people actually did not exist because the prevailing cultural norms had prevented GLBT visibility.<br /><br />This book primarily deals with the cultural aspects of GLBT rights, but it is still an important and essential read. Both scholars and/or community activists will want to understand how cultural visibility is not the same as political equality but is necessary for facilitating the progress.	2005-05-04

After all, nobody likes realizing that their own struggle has ultimately been in vain.<br /><br />The veneer of success can only fool even the best 'pretenders' into thinking they have made it in society for so long.  Even they must eventually concede that their assimilationist strategies may have inadvertently done more self-harm than good.<br /><br />The best part of Kramer's book is the recognition that the pandering to people who really do not care about GLBT rights must stop. Loosing sight of transformative goals impedes social justice progress and provides incentive for the status quo to continue tokenizing GLBT people.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book as a text for GLBT politics courses or just for personal reading on current queer political theory. Kramer's passion readily distinguishes him from people with detached reporting, and a relative disinterest in the ultimate outcome of this social justice struggle. He knows just how high the stakes are if this new world is not created.	2005-05-03

According to Lakoff's essential work, we liberals are being hindered by our own silence on the issue of 'values'. We have them, but have not publicly and proactively used this term to articulate where we personally stand on the issues and why people should vote for us. In an effort to be open to as many people as possible, we accidentally let the far right define us and our stance on the issues.<br /><br />We are not informing voters that our values support clean air/water, civil rights enforcement, non-discrimination, quality education. These positions are actually `everyday' issues according to many voter polls, but actual election returns have not always reflected this sentiment. The silence consequently misbranded our own positions as elitist and extremist.<br /><br />People then vote for the conservative not because they actually have the better plan but because they have defined themselves and assured voters they do stand for something 'important'. Whether that stance actually helps the country is (of course) omitted from the same material.<br /><br />Yelling about 'far left special interests' the GOP leadership simultaneously occupies Iraq on behalf of the American Oil industry executives. Yelling about sexual morality of a Democratic president and the `morals' of America, several GOP legislators had `secret affairs' of their own.<br /><br />I really like the style of writing used throughout this book. Lakoff does not use the book to promote himself, but instead promotes the organizing strategies which are needed to win elections. It is not enough to have a good position, candidates and elected officials must also have the right marketing This book is also invaluable because it is applicable to all candidates as opposed to one level of government.	2005-03-23

Harper Lee's classic novel 'To kill a mockingbird' after all had a black man standing trial in a deep south courtroom for allegedly assaulting a white woman, also realizing that his fair trial was a long-shot. The father, Atticus Finch became a town pariah only for believing that his client deserved justice.<br /><br />Yet, America likes to believe that we have moved beyond this and 'Willie Horton'. In our schools, mass media, and pop culture, we desperately want to believe that people are being treated fairly. This and the black community's historic memory of 'savagery/respectabilty' portrayals are not helping the intended audiences.<br /><br />Keith Boykin clarifies that America is still hung up on the intersection of sex, sexuality, and ethnicity. He also argues the hang-up prevents black men and communities from having a needed dialogue about sexuality and civil rights. Black people who find themselves outside the heterosexual binary are being attacked by the dominant society, but also face resistance from within their own communities. Some black churches who easily grasp (and were in the forefront for) racial equality are silent on sexuality, or worse---promote hatred.<br /><br />Boykin also takes on the recent inroads which white conservatives are making to black churches to downplay their past support for segregation. Because these same people have attacked and/or are attacking civil rights, Boykin is skeptical of their motives. He believes that the white conservatives are only trying to divide black communities and thus prevent real equality for all communities from being realized. Boykin argues that Black churches should not support movements which argue on behalf of discrimination.<br /><br />Boykin's book is responding to an earlier work by another author, but this publication is soothing in tone. It wants people to understand that differences have always divided Americans. Such differentiation occurs ironically when the need for unity is especially pronounced. Silence and closed-minds prevent communities from overcoming discrimination in the present and working towards a better future for all.<br /><br />Boykin's book is a provocative read for all people.

Using substantial but circumstantial evidence C.A. Tripp argues that the 16th president had engaged in homosexual relations throughout his life, including inside the White House.<br /><br />Tripp however refrains from judging how (if to any extent) Lincoln's sexuality ultimately affected his other issue positions, certainly including those which established him as a force for equality. The focus of this book aptly remains on Lincoln the person.<br /><br />Sexual orientation as a political variable was not mass recognized until the 1970's, when the George McGovern campaign held \\"a night at the baths for McGovern\\" to attract the votes of GLBT Americans. Even today,  a public official's 'outing' still generates headlines---particularly if they are a member of the Republican party.<br /><br />Because that political party has courted voters who are most likely to oppose GLBT equality, this book will provide some interesting internal controversy.  How can a party bash the very same demographic which it's own founder could be found in?<br /><br />America's concept of `democracy' has significantly expanded since the 1800's. Society still has difficulty conceding that public recognition of Lincoln as 'not heterosexual' (using the broadest research term possible) could have subsequently shut Mr. Lincoln's own political career off.<br /><br />In turn, this might have irreparably plotted the country on a different (and potentially horrible) alternate course, thus negating the civil rights movement which itself specifically had arose to hold localities and states accountable to the civil war era amendments.<br /><br />Even if he had the words to describe himself, being in the closet ultimately might have been better for Mr. Lincoln's (and the country's fate).<br /><br />Tripp himself died two years ago, but other scholars supplement this work. Jean Baker (Goucher College) provides an excellent introduction, while Michael Burlingame (Connecticut College) and Michael B. Chesson (University of Massachusetts) debate the efficacy and ethics of using 21st century language and sexual politics to describe 19th century conduct.<br /><br />There are some problems with this work. Readers will want to be aware of some unresolved issues.<br /><br />Practices such as 'bed sharing' which are today restricted to romantic partners were actually a platonic practice in earlier centuries and could not necessarily be used to indicate sexuality. Tripp's work fails to confirm that sexual activity was produced under those covers, but it does not discredit the possibility either.

Even more frustrating is the double standard. If your real life mothering does not live up to this fairytale image, there is something wrong with YOU.<br /><br />Never mind that Hollywood stars have many more economic and social resources to raise their kids with than the average American. We actually are being expected to follow their lead in order to attempt being classified as a 'good mother'. The hitch is that no matter how hard we try, we will never, ever be able to meet society's standards of what the best mother does.<br /><br />The so-called women's magazines reinforce the self-doubt. They run an endless stream of articles which are designed to gnaw at the self esteem of the most empowered woman.<br /><br />Douglas also examines how the US media represents other women. They were attempting to fulfill the cultural mandate of 'mom being at home with her kids' but women on welfare have found themselves castigated for NOT working outside of the home. Because they are poor in a society equating this with being lazy, these mothers are expected to work outside the home. When the mass media carries stories on these women, the tone is a cautionary warning.<br /><br />We also do not want to be like the mothers who harm their children. Stories of such individuals continue grabbing regional/national headlines because it veers so far off of the culturally prescribed norm of a loving and providing mother.	2005-02-05

They had assumed that I could receive special preference just because I have a disability.<br /><br />I have known that my reality is much different; employers do not have to hire me for a job which my disability prevents me from performing the essential functions, and I am responsible for getting myself to the office.<br /><br />These critical legal distinctions had made my finding a job very difficult inspite of having a dynamic resume and job recomendations which other people must work their whole lives to obtain. I was placed in the unenviable sittuation of having to turn down job offers while classmates with much lower GPAs and far less reccomendations quickly were being placed.<br /><br />This book is a great resource and affirmation.

King Jordan (then Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences) withdrew his support. Zinser subsequently announced her resignation. Jordan became Gallaudet's first deaf president.<br /><br />The DPN is an inspiring saga for anybody (particularly college students attempting to create their own campus chage). The actions of Gallaudet students later inspired me to challenge patronizing assumptions being made about my own community.	2005-02-01

I am of course refering to fraud.<br /><br />In addition to the shinning paragons, you will run across people who seem nice, but something about them just does not seem right upon initial meeting. Dumping rather than attempting to accommodate them will save you time and possibly a lot of heartache and money.<br /><br />When an acquaintance of mine announced that he was starting up a magazine, I enthusiastically accepted. Because I had only written for the campus media up until that point, reaching national audiences was an intoxicating idea.<br /><br />This occurred despite another person warning me that this acquaintance had a reputation for being unreliable. Since I have also been judged unfairly by people throughout my life, I decided that I would instead give him the benefit of my doubt.<br /><br />For the first couple of years, everything was progressing nicely. True, there was no product and the extent of our `company' was email and telephone conversation. But, I decided that since we were undertaking an ambitious project, I needed to cut people some slack and relax.<br /><br />I became suspicious when the organization's once-constant information stream slowed to a trickle, and then nothing, followed by the publisher leaving. Finally, when my now-former colleague accused me of being unprofessional only for wanting to be able to give people (including family and close friends whom I had previously gushed to about the project) confirmation that I had not made up the company after an unexpected delay, I was side-swiped, but only for a moment.<br /><br />I thought I would feel remorse and anger from his words, but oddly, I feel relief. If this person was so threatened by my request for public information about our once-joint venture at this point, I shudder to think what would have happened later on (even assuming that things would work according to his timetable and preferences). Attempting reconciliation or sweet-talking was not even worth it.<br /><br />I am happy that this man never saw a cent of my money, saddened that there are many more like him out in this society. I am also relieved that preparing for the worst is not overreacting, but a sound business strategy which will give me the good life.

This book explains how public policy is made, the types of models which could be used to make/evaluate a public policy, and an overview of how public policymaking fits into the American government process.<br /><br />Since most people have only learned about the three branches of government, they may not be certain how passed laws are enacted. Lacking the time and expertise needed to implement these laws, legislators at the federal, state, and local levels delegate authority to agencies to make the policy which will implement these laws.<br /><br />The chief benefit of this text is the qualitative approach which Birkland personally prefers (although he does warn that other approaches use an economics-based approach) and clear explanations. It also contains an annotated bibliography of influential works and a dictionary of key terms used in the public policymaking process.<br /><br />Birkland's text is written so that it can be used either by students or public policy practitioners. Instead of bogging down the reader in minutiae and personal liberty, he wanted to emphasize how important public policy is.	2005-01-29

Bush was elected to a second term.<br /><br />Although a majority of people were against his Iraq policies, the allegedly 'liberal' mass media made the election returns seem like a solid mandate. Bush actually had won by a slim margin of victory, and Kerry actually had put up a good showing in that close race.<br /><br />Notable progressives such as Leslie Cagan and Jenifer Ponzer eschew hand-wringing and finger pointing for constructive and proactive solutions.  I fear that we on the left have become too accommodating to other viewpoints without giving the American people an affirmative reason to vote for our own side.<br /><br />We consequently have allowed our opponents to define (mislead others) what being a liberal is instead of reminding people that liberalism is the very same ideology which has fought against tainted food, lynching, and  segregated public facilities. I personally do not want to live in an America without these and many other developments.<br /><br />I also appreciated that this book offered contact information so we could get in touch with other like-minded people, and build an America which all people can be genuinely proud of.

Born in Hawaii to a family with high aspirations, Obama also temporarily lived in Jakarta before coming back to the United States to live with his grandparents, but his mother returned later.<br /><br />Those life experiences have provided Obama with the grounding he needed to succeed in education and the work environment. Undertaking and completing challenging tasks is routine for Obama.<br /><br />His first post-college job was organizing Altgeld Gardens's residents in Chicago.<br /><br />After graduating from Harvard Law School (where he made the prestigious review) he resumed a career in Chicago, this time helping to register voters in the 1992 election. Obama subsequently lectured at the University of Chicago until his Senate election.<br /><br />Demonstrated through his convention speech, Obama is thoughtful and articulate. Even if he's actually not intending to use this book as a presidential campaign launching pad, I can't help but admire a person who has accomplished so much---and still wants to accomplish much more. Resting on their own laurels would have been very easy for a person with his credentials, but he chose hard work.<br /><br />This book will make you believe: Obama for President.	2005-01-21

The author sees a place for religion, arguing that the exclusion of religion from the political sphere is unrealistic. It does not reflect the way which Americans have and continue to make policy.<br /><br />Even liberal politicians are motivated to enter public life and work on behalf of other people because of their own religious convictions according to this book. Denying that these are moral values and their roots in religious belief damages our own standing. This denial then feeds into a stereotype that the left is bereft of any morals or opposes religious people.<br /><br />At the same time. Wallis takes on the 'religious right' who have comadeered Republican Party infrastructure since the late 1970's/early 1980's. He argues their current interpretation of 'good' public policy is also counterproductive to good public policymaking; anybody not sharing their worldview instantly becomes demonized. Because there are so many different religious perspectives in America (even among Christian denominations themselves) religious right actions actually undercut the standing of religion throughout American society, as practiced by these groups religion becomes percieved as something which is harsh, judgemental, and exclusionary.<br /><br />I appreciated this book's complex view of religion. It clarifies that the problem is not religion itself, but how we employ it in public life which is the real problem.	2005-01-19

We are treated badly because our schools and/or school districts assume that students in special education cannot make meaningful contributions to the world.<br /><br />I would have liked to see more essays on gender differences in special education service eligibility /receipt. Girls are less often referred/enrolled in special education classes than boys.<br /><br />I also would (not surprising given my own program participation) liked to see an essay (or a couple) which examines the program/staff from the perspective of students with disabilities, and includes their own self-perceptions. If they feel stigmatized for being in special education, what coping strategies (if any) are these students with disabilities utilizing?<br /><br /> I would also recommend lowering the price so this critical work reaches a larger audience (even for a 'trade' paperback, the cost may deter all but the most already-fascinated individuals).<br /><br />Overall however, I feel the editors and authors have attempted to provide a reasonable forum for discussion of a still-volatile issue.	2005-01-18

'America first' public policies assume that we do not have to consider the impact on other countries when we make foregin policy and America should only think about it's own needs, especially in the very short-term. These strategies never worked for any president, but he zeroes in on Iraq policy to illustrate his point.<br /><br />For instance the presumed next secretary-of-state Condoleeza Rice said the United States would punish countries which had not agreed with America's decision to invade Iraq. Because the evidence we used for this incursion was faulty and we have even publicly conceded there reaklly were no WMD's in Iraq, I am curious what Dr. Rice thinks punishing other countries will accomplish.<br /><br />This book reinforced my perception that those countries will be loathe to join the Bush administration on any other project. They do not wish to voluntarily work with an administration living in a world where America believes that it can punnish independent nations for not wanting to use forged evidence to to kill their own troops. I honestly do not blame them either.<br /><br />They may have the titles, but people inside the Bush administration lack the people skills which are needed for 21st century government. These officials still do not want to realize that team work and coalition building (both of which require accurate data) are essential for building a world that is both strong and safe.<br /><br />Essentially creation of such a world requires adherence to the time-honored grade school adage: Do onto others as you would have them do onto you\\". Part of me honestly had hoped that such a phrase would not be over Bush's head.	2005-01-15

The Bush family has spent millions projecting an image of 'down home' folks whose only concerns are 'faith' and 'family'. It's a pretty picture, but the authors of this book affirm that it is only an image. They are wolves in sheep clothing.<br /><br />Since the days of their association with Hitler, the Bush family is only interested in power. However they get it and however they can keep it is the only thing which really matters to these people. Their obligatory talks about 'morals'...etc are just put in to give the illusion of caring about democracy. If they had their own way, the Bush family would have all of us living under a dictatorship.<br /><br />This book is vastly different from most of the anti-Bush texts which flood the market. It eschews cheap shots to instead bring serious evidence against America's reigning monarchy. It also explains how Junior's 'bumblings' are only the more public versions of what daddy did dating back from his job as CIA head. Insteaad of being embarassed...etc the Bush family is actually proud of his actions!	2005-01-15

Their own perserverance reminds me that our job is often thankless, but a passion for justice is one of a journalist's most effective tools.<br /><br />For all of my frustration with the current status of Texas/National politics, these pages remind me times were once much worse in Texas. When segregation was still considered matter of fact, the Observer pushed ahead with the 'radical' idea that all people deserved human rights.<br /><br />Finally, the Observer produced such now-nationally recognized figures as Jim Hightower and Molly Ivins. Ivins continues to cheer me up today with her right-on commentary that George W. Bush is a danger to the world, and not all Texans approve of him (or had even wanted him involved with any kind of government).	2005-01-15

The only freedom we were interested in was attempting to ensure that America would have a free oil supply.<br /><br />Even after UN data revealed there were no WMD's, we quickly transformed a disarmament mandate into a regime change. Many of the same people who would be howling with anger if America's self-determination rights were similarly breached became oddly silent when we decided for ourselves that Iraq needed new (and more pro-American) leadership.<br /><br />We have now reluctantly learned that the Iraqi's themselves were not happy to live under an American colonial government (regardless of what we were calling it). While we were talking about 'democracy' and 'freedom', we were preventing the Iraqi people from deciding if they actually wanted us in their own country.<br /><br />Not doubting that Saddam was a brutal dictator, I question whether the Iraq policies of the Bush regime were any more humane.	2005-01-15

In this second book since his conversion from conservatism, Brock acknowledges that the media (for all of the yelling about the 'liberal press')actually is quite complicit (and even helpful) to the Republican Party. Again using his insider knowledge of the right, Brock is not merely speculating, he is speaking the truth in an era when independence is reduced to a sound bite.<br /><br />Beyond the obvious examples (such as the 700 Club, which pointedly markets itself as a religious infomercial) located in the television-programming grid, Brock has us consider more 'mainstream' purveyors of conservative news.<br /><br />Conservative transformation of the news has worked precisely because all sources cannot readily be documented, and the purveyors have proactively pointed fingers at 'the liberals' for theoretically committing the same transgressions that they are actually engaging in.<br /><br />Chief offender is FOX news. Despite the 'public' reputation as the network that launched sexually loaded teen dramas, in fact is quite conservative. FOX mogul Rupert Murdoch makes use of his GOP ties in stories.<br /><br />Because the new industry buzzword is 'infotainment', viewers aren't being encouraged to seek or desire complex issues, these become derided as 'waffling'. This product marketing also inevitably prevents the masses from questioning why economic and/or political power is concentrated in the hands of an elite few inside this DEMOCRACY. Everything on these news shows subsequently becomes reduced to a naive 'good vs. bad' presentation; anything that cannot fit in this category is either ignored or (ironically) derided as 'bias'.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this scenario leaves the same Americans who honestly think that they are getting the truth instead under informed about the activities of their own government...etc.	2005-01-12

He also is concerned that it will not produce peace in the region. Hopefully Iraq criticism from an infamous conservative will force the administration (or at least a majority of their backers) to wake up and acknowledge the fundamentally flawed nature of the Iraq policy.<br /><br />Publication of this book hardly means that Gingrich has joined the left however. On all other issues, he's still as conservative as ever.<br /><br />At the same time I'm agreeing with the Iraq critique, I take issue with his ongoing efforts to reenlist in the cultural war. Newt once again looses my support when he insists that our current public policy problems exist only because God was driven out of the public arena (I am assuming that he is referring to the 1960's court ruling Engle v. Vitale).<br /><br />I am wary of arguments which attempt to imply that things were automatically better in the past, few people in this country would like lunch counter segregation, denial of voting rights, sexual harassment being allowed in the workplace, pregnancy workplace discrimination...etc.<br /><br />Plus, considering his own marital infidelity, Gingrich then has a lot of nerve attempting to lecture others about values. Values are a very hot-button issue because nobody wants to be percieved as being against them, regardless of their actual personal conduct<br /><br />This part of the book implies that he himself does not have to take responsibility for upholding the sanctity of his own marital union, any violation must of course be the fault of 'outside' forces and there were NO social problems of any kind in an earlier era. On this, I am still not buying Gingrich's arguments (the reason for three stars).<br /><br />The book would have been MUCH stronger if it only had been an attack on the current Iraq policy. National news networks would find it hard to ignore one of the country's best known Republicans challenging the current party leader with those statements.

Although this participation does not seem very revolutionary today, it was remarkable for a woman who had grown up when women running around in the outdoors actually was considered a very scandalous activity.<br /><br />Although she did not have her own radio show or chair a presidential task force, Lou Henry Hoover was a revolutionary force in her own right.<br /><br />Mrs. Hoover similarly became engaged with private-sector relief efforts which attempted to end the Great Depression, but these proved much less successful than her other projects. Like her husband, Mrs. Hoover could not realize that the private sector lacked the resources to salvage a decimated economy, the same government which printed the nation's money supply would have to step in.<br /><br />Clearly empathetic towards her subject, Young is also objective enough to avoid romanticizing the Hoover's strong free-market economic beliefs. Her scholarship adds a complexity to both the Hoovers and an understanding of the first lady's constantly evolving role.<br /><br />A relatively 'traditional' public demeanor ultimately enabled Mrs. Hoover to begin a transition of the \\"First Lady\\" role AND \\"American Womanhood\\" which her successors are only continuing.	2005-01-09

Replacing previous medical models, Wendel persuasively argues that women with disabilities are a multiply oppressed class, echoing the works of Gloria Anzaldua...etc.<br /><br />Because prioritizing among disability, sex and other idenities is impossible, Wendel instead advances an analysis which intergrates all components into a social justice tool.<br /><br />Some women with disabilities also desire to become mothers, but the state maintains (albeit in more 'covert' language than eugenics statues) restrictions against the sexuality of women with disabilities. The idea that women with disabilities are also sexual beings remains a shocking concept.<br /><br />For all of society's theoretical tolerance, it still panics whenever people do not have 'perfect bodies' especially because of disability. Since women still are judged by their bodies, this schema ultimately amplifies our subordination...and inadvertently provides resistance incentive.	2005-01-09

I am empathetic to most of his argument, but wonder why he had not devoted more time to critiquing the 'centrist' Democratic Leadership Council for also being conservative.<br /><br />Blacks have become almost solidly Democratic voters since the 1960's, but constructive criticism of 'friends' is always important to effective policymaking. Bill Clinton's signature of 'welfare reform' and welfare's post-war blatant racial stereotyping as a haven for black 'baby machines' should have waranted more pointed critique from this very text.<br /><br />It is oddly silent on this and other issues where the Democratic Party moved to the right, in an attempt to siphon off the 'Gingrich Revolution' of 1994.<br /><br />His book also is problematic because he does not (as other scholars from Gloria Anzaldua to Dorothy Roberts have done) recognize that one's public policy experiences intersect with MULTIPLE idenities. A black low-income lesbian woman with disabilities has a much different social experience than a rich white heterosexual able-bodied man or even a black heterosexual man without disabilities. It it currently impossible to lump 'black people' and 'white people' together into one hedgemonic group as he apparently did throughout the book.<br /><br />Because we live in an era of Alan Keyes and Condoleeza Rice, I also wish there was information on the apparent paradox posed by Black conservatives. I don't personally have to like their policies to recognize the challenge to Walter's thesis; some individuals are both conservative AND black. Hopefully future editions of this book will address that area's inherent sociopolitical complexity.	2005-01-08

Betty Ford certainly proved that.<br /><br />John Robert Greene's biography of Betty Ford does justice to a woman who was so clearly ahead of her time, and certainly not afraid to admit it either. Whether people love or hate her, they ultimately admit that Betty Ford has ideas of her own.  Greene, a historian, previously authored biographies on George H.W. Bush and (appropriately) Gerald Ford.<br /><br />After Spiro T. Agnew and Richard Nixon's resignations, Gerald Ford unexpectedly became the nation's president.  Although he is relatively liberal by current Republican standards (which was issue of contention in the 1976 Republican primary) Ford was conservative when compared to his own wife.<br /><br />Even though she was from the World War II era generation---who weren't supposed to support women's liberation, Ford instead championed the Equal Rights Amendment and gave public thanks that abortion was `brought out of the back woods' in interviews which were undoubtedly path-breaking in their own day.<br /><br />In a time when the new right was preparing for the Reagan and Bush eras, Betty Ford was a true lightning rod. Effectively defusing an idea that only `radicals' or `wide eyed youth' wanted policy AND cultural changes, she helped to successfully infuse women's rights with a public `respectability' that several other public female supporters were not able to achieve in 1974-1976. Being First Lady gave Mrs. Ford the ability to draw middle America to the very social movements which they otherwise might have feared.<br /><br />For instance, after finding a lump in her own breast, Mrs. Ford encouraged other women to talk about breast cancer---and promoted the early detection which is now commonplace in America. Because then prevailing sentiment had been to `keep quiet' and attempt treating cancer in later and ultimately more difficult stages, Mrs. Ford has saved many women's lives. When compared against the Republican Party's subsequent and current `pro-family' ideology which actually attempts hiding frank discussions of human anatomy, her actions truly were `pro-life'.<br /><br />For all its celebration, the book does pointedly acknowledge that Ford had a substance abuse problem. Again turning personal experience into public enlightenment/growth, Ford lent her name to the Betty Ford treatment center in California. If the center has subsequently become the stuff of pop culture, it also has humanized first ladies; they experience problems AND also have opinions how to end those problems.<br /><br />Even if she was never actually a co-president and was generally content as First Lady, Betty Ford had ultimately opened the door for successors Rosalyn Carter and Hillary Rodham Clinton to increase the public role in ways which Eleanor Roosevelt had only dreamt about.

The town furniture maker Mr. Chips also donates a wheelbarow full of new furniture, and their friends give bits and pieces from their own homes (which unexplainably are not flooded).<br /><br />Despite the implausabilities throughout this story (Mr. Rusty and his family are the only flood victims, and his train conductor job did not provide any assistance for bad events like this!) it is a charming tale of friendship and community support.

Same-sex marriage is not just being written about to make headlines or money, it is an issue which she personally feels obligated to stand up on behalf of.<br /><br />She believes that same-sex marriage is not something which certain GLBT people should care about. The legality of these unions is a human rights issue which everybody (including myself and other heterosexuals) should publicly support.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the examples which she uses (and the arrangement of this book) leave something to be desired. Since the far right is able to convince some voters of their own position largely through simplicity of their own arguments (i.e. \\"because the bible says\\" or \\"do you want to be moral?\\" Kotulski does her own argument a huge disservice.<br /><br />People who are scared of the changes which might be brought with legalized same sex marriage are not necessarily going to examine the intricate parts of this book for subsequent answers. Feeling confused, those same people will instead turn to the first source which can provide them with easy and immediate answers about this world...even if the ensuing positions are intolerant.<br /><br />I am concerned that the author inadvertently cedes an opportunity for social change by assuming everybody will take the time to calm down and reject fear. As much as I would also like this to happen, I have to recognize how powerful paranoia of the 'different' has been in American public policy processes.	2004-12-31

The assumption was that the monthly welfare payment would provide another chance for these families to assimilate to 'proper' gender roles about women not working outside the home.<br /><br />Yet, when those programs began intergrating in the 1960's, the nation subsequently began hearing about the alleged flaws of the 'welfare queen'. Now, women who wanted to stay at home with their children were reduced to parasites. Welfare reform attempts were not new (Nixon attempted them in the early 1970's) but the bipartisan support for 'ending welfare as we know it' was unprecedented.<br /><br />The 'welfare reform' charge became so compelling that even 'new' Democrat Bill Clinton signed the 1996 overall, despite himself having grown up in poverty --- and thus being able to personally understand the reasons why women would need to use public assistance.<br /><br />Because the actual payment levels had not kept up with minimum cost of living state estimates by the 1990's, it was actually impossible to become rich off of the monthly welfare check. Despite these compelling statistics, the government recognized that keeping other people in a frenzy about 'waste' in this most conservative of industrialized nations offered more political rewards.	2004-12-30

Bush's White House	Books	5	77	92	N	N	Bush administration = religious fascists	This book documents the religious right's attack on America through George W. Bush's reign of terror. Even Ronald Reagan (who was the first modern president to court the religious right in order to win the Republican presidential nomination) never had attempted to divide America through religion to this extent.<br /><br />From John Ashcroft's tenure as Attorney General to the establishment of a White House office for religious outreach, this administration has reached new lows in religious zealotry. Good government policy has thus become defined as only what conveniently matches the Bush administration's own religious convictions.<br /><br />The unprecedented errors in government publications are allowed because the religious right honestly is not interested in having a realistic public policy discussion. They want to condemn and punish ANYBODY who does not share their totalitarian world view. This includes people of faith who WANT everybody to enjoy religious freedom.<br /><br />Bush may be sincere in his own religious convictions, but I cannot see this same belief system being of actual moral use if he is trampling the First Amendment rights of myself and other citizens--who are also a part of the America he is supposed to work for.<br /><br />For all Bush's fancy education, he has selectively forgotten that the First Amendment also protects the religious rights of other people, and also people who do not want to engage in any religious practices (organized or otherwise).<br /><br />The First Amendment was enacted because the framers had personal experience with theocracies in England and the colonies; a person who was outside of the state-sponsored religion automatically became less of a person, and (virtually) ceased to exist as a being.<br /><br />If the president of America is not interested in learning from American history, we are in deeper trouble than initially imagined.	2004-12-28

We also are sporadically hand wringing over the 'disappearance' of childhood.<br /><br />Recognizing the power which comes from/with the reshaping of these beliefs, Steven Minz takes the reader on a most powerful voyage which we will do very well not to forget.<br /><br />John and Rebecca Moores Professor of History and Director of the American Cultures Program at the University of Houston, Minz is a recognized authority on the histories of families and children. We cannot comment qualitatively about the present without first understanding the past.<br /><br />Considering the hackles which his topic will undoubtedly raise throughout the American political spectrum, Minz deftly presents his research that 1)childhood as we know it is a very recent invention and 2)children are dealing with more, but (unlike earlier times) we recognize they must have more resources (increased education, immunizations, health care, playtime/development...etc). Minz also is scrupulous about reminding his readers that race/ethnicity, gender, and religion do impact a child's life experiences...both then and now.<br /><br />In an era prior to childhood vaccinations, a White middle-class boy could draw upon more privllege than a low-income African American girl (who would have to contend with segregated schools and other facilities in addition to having to help her family by working).<br /><br />Because of child labor, disease/malnutrition, and a prevailing view of children as 'little adults', hardship was the rule rather than the exception for most of history. We remain moved by the story of Huck Finn and others precisely because these experiences are closest to our own times rather than an accurate depiction of their own.	2004-12-27

We are then able to prove that we are capable of functioning in society, and attitudes were the biggest barriers.<br /><br />The general thoroughness of this work is undercut when the person trying to comment on a situation does not appear to be aware of everybody who has participated in that nationally-publicized event.	2004-12-27

Kennedy. Kennedy would of course successfully go on to the presidency in 1960 after rising to national prominence in the 1950's with Profiles in Courage.  Certainly, there are some similarities between these two titles and authors.<br /><br />Kennedy was also roundly critiqued for writing a book about `leadership' when he (certainly unlike brother Ted) had not been in the Senate leadership---or even in elective office----for a substantial period of time.<br /><br />While Hutchinson certainly could also find herself facing similar allegations today, her own work adds the layer of gender analysis which had obviously not been made available to Kennedy in the 1950's.<br /><br />Hutchinson's book has the benefit of being written well after the revival of American feminism. Feminism has subsequently encouraged many women to increase their public sector participation, find `role models' for themselves, and make further progress on behalf of future generations. Whatever personal-political label she now claims (if any), Bailey had also participated in some of the feminist movement's activities-another claim which Kennedy could not make with his own earlier book. Whereas he was attempting to court swing voters who would not have recognized him unless he was representing their state, Hutchinson is also attempting to court women's rights advocates who might perhaps discount her interest in gender equity issues because of her state and party identification.<br /><br />The feminist movement is technically non-partisan, but the institutionalization of feminist and anti-feminist interest groups has entrenched the political parties. Hutchinson is hardly the only Republican woman serving in the senate (she is joined by four others) but she does take a more economically/socially moderate voting record than her New England counterparts Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe. This in turn causes state and national feminist PACS to give their \\"Republican\\" money only to the `gypsy moths' and avoid the southern Republicans.  Unfortunately, those feminist groups also overlook the common ground they do have with Hutchinson on women's rights.<br /><br />As a member of the Texas legislature, Hutchinson co-authored a rape reform bill with Sarah Weddington (who would later gain fame for successfully arguing Roe v. Wade) which reformed that state's rape prosecution laws. Removing the burden of proof from the survivor...etc, the Bailey-Weddington law successfully challenged the historical idea that `good' women were not raped; rape was a crime of power---not lust or morals. Hutchinson also helped to pass the displaced homemakers bill, women who could no longer financially afford to be homemakers (whether because of divorce, breadwinner death, or the rising costs) deserved transition assistance such as college tuition credit breaks.<br /><br />Finally, Hutchinson came out against Admiral Frank Kelso's full retirement with military honors because she believed the women who had accused him of sexual harassment; her own personal experiences had subsequently built up her empathy for women in similar situations.<br /><br />This is hardly the resume of an anti-woman right wing extremist.<br /><br />Certainly Hutchinson has been careful with these `woman activist' credentials. Local and state reproductive rights groups have criticized her position on abortion for being `multiple choice'. Bailey wants to continue portraying herself as a `moderate' while also being acutely aware the social conservatives who control the Texas Republican Party are not open to any compromise on abortion. Because they consider abortion (and even some kinds of birth control) `murder,' these groups eye Hutchinson with suspicion-is she really their `friend'?<br /><br />Since women's history remains generally underreported in Texas, I actually had considered the through inclusion of women's history important to the central premise of Hutchinson's book. Hutchinson understands that increases in women's political participation did not happen out of the goodness of somebody's heart, but instead took many years to see fruition. The individuals who are profiled in this book are only a fragment of the masses who were once formally excluded from political participation. Such a legal expansion had taken many years to achieve, and our democratic nation is still dismantling cultural vestiges against women's public sector participation according to interspersed narratives about the Senator's own life.<br /><br />The interweaving of her own personal life story (although definitely needing better editing for continuity purposes) throughout this book definitely serves a purpose. It is supposed to remind critics/potential critics that Hutchinson personally does not want to return to the `good old days' when women's issues were only regarded as private-personal issues. She approaches it differently, but appears to share some common ground with left-wing feminists who have advocated for greater gender equity in both government and the general society, including former United States Representatives Bella Abzug and Patricia Schroeder.<br /><br />The fact that two women have served as secretary of state (and are both included in this book) illustrates how far we have come from 1955 when the only women in presidential cabinets had served in `outer cabinet' positions. Frances Perkins was the first female cabinet secretary in 1933 (Labor), by the publication of Kennedy's book, Oveta Culp Hobby lead Eisenhower's Department of Health Education and Welfare Such expansion of women's leadership roles also demonstrates how the national definition of `leadership' itself has expanded.<br /><br />I question whether some of the profiles which were included in this book would genuinely share Hutchinson's gender consciousness (however self-labeled). Even if they are not attacking it, it seems like some of these other women are not grateful for the gender/racial revolutions which made their public sector participation a reality.<br /><br />Considering that Iraq's ever-mounting casuality level is being facilitated through her promotion of false evidence about Iraq's (ultimately non-existent) `weapons of mass destruction' program, including Condoleezza Rice among the leadership profiles is not wise. Because Rice's claim had comprised the backbone of the Bush administration's rationale for invading Iraq, the subsequent truth substantially undercuts her public weight for this---and other public policies. This person, who thought nothing of American troops deployed with fabricated evidence, does not convincingly demonstrate values and morals herself.<br /><br />It is important that we can recognize that women are not automatically better or more ethical leaders than their male counter parts. Although this proposition honestly is still being advanced by the editors of some other `women in politics' titles, it is generally now in disfavor.  Speaking only for myself, I would rather have a male public official in office with whom I agreed with on the issues than a woman public official with whom I did not agree with, but still increased women's numerical representation in government-such as Hutchinson herself.  Even if she is confirmed by the Senate as the next Secretary of State, Rice is not likely to be remembered as an ethical individual who did the right thing for America.<br /><br /> I do however applaud Hutchinson for wanting to show that talented women can (and do) cross all ideological and/or party affiliations. At this point, the only people who are considering books on women's leadership to be `extremist' are themselves extremist in their scornful view of all women's public sector potential.

We also know that times of panic (Joe McCarthy) had also prompted otherwise reasonable people to abandon their civil liberties for the now-familiar promise of 'national security'.<br /><br />Yet, what is new about the post 9/11 climate is the depth of these anti-terrorism policies and the general public's apparent willingness to sacrifice their freedom inexplicably to receive 'security'.<br /><br />Whether it is the terror alert 'color' of the day, or the list of people who can/cannot fly on planes, national security could instead be used as a tool to generate even more fear...or a weapon to attack political dissenters.<br /><br />A government effectively stifling criticism of its policies as `being for the terrorists' is allowed to do whatever it wants to citizens whenever it wants.

Because Rustin lived in a time when homosexuality was stigmatized (and march organizers had believed public recognition of his homosexuality was not 'respectable' Rustin had to keep this portion of his life hidden in order to have impact at this event.<br /><br />Rustin complied with the now-unthinkable directive because social justice had always been a passion.<br /><br />Rustin's Quaker upbringing influenced his passion for social justice. In college, he became an organizer for the Young Communist League; he later quit when they advocated World War II participation. Rustin's strong sense of morality would not allow him to enlist in World War II, he believed that a sentence in the federal prison system was the only moral option.<br /><br />Rustin began freedom riding with the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) as early as the 1940's. Although these people were ahead of their time on many issues, they could not accept his sexuality. Rustin later found employment with the War Resisters League (which in that era at least stayed neutral on the issue) but the experience undoubtedly stayed with him.<br /><br />Fortunately, Rustin was able to later come out in the 1970's.

In this book, Barbara Hillyer wanted to talk about disability and feminism while selectively ignoring the voices of myself and other feminists with disabilities who would have lots to share.<br /><br />Although this book gave me some perspective on the emotions my parents (who have since come out as feminists) went through with my own childhood...etc, the focus on Hillyer's daughter inadvertently emphasizes dependence and people-with-disability-as-children stereotypes.<br /><br />I don't doubt that this experience itself is difficult, especially with ongoing sociopolitical limitations after disability is identified. But, the approach of this book ultimately is detrimental to the progressive world which we all supposedly wish to have.<br /><br />Hillyer spends more time worrying about people with disabilities than actually wanting to hear our own experiences and perspectives. Her (admittedly 'new') analysis of care giving/assisting for people with disabilities through a feminist perspective is seriously weakened through this aforementioned limited approach. She does not consider that we are capable of caregiving for ourselves and each other.<br /><br />Even if we are not saying the things she wants to hear, our own perspectives are also important for social justice obtainment.<br /><br />Advocating on behalf of people with disabilities is impossible without our own voices and ideas being fully included. Echoing the general feminist movement, we also believe that the personal is political.<br /><br />Several times while attempting to get through the personal  aggrandizement readily placed throughout this book (ironically from a person who also writes that she does not want to be seen as a martyr!), I checked the publication date to see if I was reading something which was first published in the 1960's (if not earlier).<br /><br />Because those earlier published 'disability' books also had 'experts' rushing to speak on behalf of people with disabilities ourselves, I am honestly saddened that so little has changed in subsequent years.<br /><br />For all of her `revolutionary' intentions, Hillyer echoes the status quo assumptions of people with disabilities as being inactive, dependent, and child-like. One of the first widely accessible works on feminism and disability, this book now is thankfully overshadowed by far superior texts from Susan Wendel...etc.<br /><br />Today, Hillyer's book would be a mediocre selection for library collections on disability, and a very poor choice for people with disabilities wanting to see how feminist theory and disability issues intersect.<br /><br />Were I to meet with her at a conference...etc, Hillyer apparently would not consider me a colleague and/or activist associate.

Because it is so easy to take young people's voices for granted in this society (by all political parties) the idea of contributing to a nationally published anthology was sureal.<br /><br />Despite my own stellar political record (past and present) I had honestly wondered if I would be taken seriously after this book was published. I also wondered if there were enough of us in the world to make a difference.<br /><br />My piece is on disability issues and Democratic politics. Because I am a person with a disability I had to become involved in politics---and at an early age. Challenging personal experiences subsequently gave me a greater empathy for other social justice struggles. We are all connected to each other.<br /><br />Whatever your own politics, you will find a kindered spirit in this collection. The editors (a Republican and Democrat) took great pains to select interesting contributions from a wide variety of sources. Because just tapping people who matched their own politics would have been an easier task, they also deserve kudos for this project.	2004-11-29

Because myself and many other Americans have benefited from the civil rights laws of the last thirty years, it is eye opening to remember a world had once existed without those laws.<br /><br />People with disabilties were so scorned by society that 'erasing' their presence or locking them up at home was previously considered the most loving option. Partially from their own history with Rosemary, the Kennedys felt obligated to use their reputation and change these public moores.<br /><br />This same book also notes how the independent living movement eventually surpassed Eunice Kennedy Shriver's Special Olympic work as the most visible manifestation of people with disabilties. Although their visiblity was made possible through the family's previous community organizing, people with disabilities themselves subsequently sought a greater role in a movement dedicated to their rights.<br /><br />However enlightened for the time, Special Olympics are today considered by some people to instead reinforce 'poster child' sterotypes of people with disabilities. Reccent Special Olympic materials are mindful of the shift, now stressing participant empowerment and dignity. Mental retardation references were revised with the term 'intellectual disabilities'.<br /><br />This is not a particularly involved read, but it is interesting for people interested in the Kennedy family and/or disability rights. Because it is supposed to focus on the family's contributions to this policy area, the scope is much smaller than other disability history books. At the same time, this book does not pretend this family had all the answers with disability rights issues, and acknowlleged they were as influenced by other activists as the activists were influenced by them.	2004-11-22

What seems like a given was obviously (and still is) radical because Kmart had basically sunk itself into oblivion with insistence on circa 1980 marketing, and Walmart is where you would go for perishable goods. 'Good clothes' instantly makes me think of Target.<br /><br />The commercials for this chain are very attractive, working in the store logo with young and trendy op art imagery. Wanting to save money can be both fun and hip only if you are shopping at the Target store. People not realizing that Target was a discount merchandiser could honestly believe they were being asked to shop at an exclusive botique. This was entirely the point of their advertising strategy.<br /><br />The reading for this book is not particularly insightful (being written by one of Target's concept makers), but can provide some thought. Business success depends on the ability to carve out a niche.	2004-11-21

This author argues that the American people are so programmed to accept \\"me first, me now\\" that we are not thinking about numerous consequences of the fast food industry. All of the convienience comes at a very large (and potentially life threatining) price.<br /><br />In what will unarguably become the most riveting chapter, he points out the meat is so cheap because it has feces and other toxins which are not allowed in the supermarket products. However unpleasant, we need to recognize that accidents such as the early 1990's Jack in the Box food poisoning were not isolated incidents. Any company which is allowed to use sub-grade materials to make their products will (if not now) eventually be confronted with the consequences of their actions.<br /><br />Although the fast food industries belatedly market 'healthy' meal options, reading the research on how they have increased childhood obesity is also very informative. Part of the problem IS the parents (who can choose what they buy for kids) it is also an indictment on society. We produce imagery telling people to be thin, do not have 'bad cholesterol---and then still entice them to chow down on meals which balloon them up. The fast food industries know their 'prizes' entice the kids to eat these foods, or why else would they spend so much marketing and advertising time on this demographic.<br /><br />This book will become a modern day 'The Jungle' because of the expose which it's careful and extensive research provides.	2004-11-01

Martin either personally has disabilities herself, and/or knows the real-life struggles of people who do, but this is an unflinchingly realistic account of what it is like to be a teenager with a disability in America. Years after reading it in a fourth grade English class, I remain impressed at the storyline candor.<br /><br />Sure, there are laws on the books then protecting Stacey's access to education...etc but her real challenges come from insensitive peers. A friend had liked Stacey until she found out that Stacey had diabetes during a sleepover, and then ended their friendship abruptly. Having endured identical torturous experience for my own disability, I appreciate the unflinchingly honest (and even descriptively blunt) account of what this reality is like.<br /><br />Likewise, the issue of well-meaning but over protective parents are brought up. Stacey's minor status is compounded by the fact that she is also a person with a disability. Rushing to 'help' her with something they do not personally themselves have, parental actions frustrate Stacey. She loves them dearly, but wants her life to be much more than hospitals and doctors---Stacey only wants to be a 'normal' kid.<br /><br />Yes, this subject area might go beyond standard children's fare, but taking note of the human effects of discrimination and 'difference' are important. Even if they do not have disabilities themselves, young adults should read this book to realize that teasing other people because of their disability does hurt everybody.	2004-10-26

Disaffected shoppers then began turning to the other discount stores.<br /><br />Things became so bad that 'store brands' (usually a godsend for thrifty shoppers) were pulled only because of name stigmatization. It is a bad omen when a store is ashamed of it's own brands.<br /><br />Kmart actually was unable to figure out why it's clientele base shrunk while Wal-mart and Target respectively grew into the powerhouses of today. By the 21st century, the only people really in love with Kmart's business decisonmaking were the executives who apparently got paid no matter what bad decision they fastened the company to.<br /><br />After reading this scathing-but fair indictment for myself, I also am amazed nobody from the inside was concered about the shortcomings. The early 1990's 'Big K' concept failed because the company merely put a new sign on the same dinky and dingy stores of yesterday. Constructing more new stores AND a new training program would have made the critical world of difference.<br /><br />In a Kmart as late as 2003, I was openly taken aback by the dirty floor and cluttered layout. I had honestly chalked that one 'current' experience up to the 'back to school' rush, but if most of the stores in a company are in this condition---there are very big management problems. No amount of downsizing or 'new' brand introduction can bail out a company with such obvious disgust for customers.	2004-10-13

Bush has turned the concrete mission to hunt suspected 9/11 mastermind Osama Bin Laden into an intentionally open-ended justification to find and stop anybody whom his administration thinks is a threat to 'homeland security'.<br /><br />Because the term itself is so vaugely defined, it is being used to justify many measures which would have been unthinkable to most people a decade ago. Instead of being an election year wedge issue, the Bush adminstration's extremisim has been identified by other Republicans.<br /><br />The courts's striking down of various provisions of the Patriot Act for citizen liberty infringement does not impress this administration (even when those ruling judges are themselves Republicans). Reflecting their own extremisim (which was incidentally not seen since the days of Joe McCarthy's anti-communist witch hunts) Bush administration officials try to insist that anybody who wants to critically examine government strategy may themselves be terrorist---or at least sympathetic to the cause.<br /><br />Because 'terrorist' in that context CAN be used to encompass anyone/anything 'different' from the administration itself, their strategy will ultimately fail in the publically-stated objective to make America safer. A government which gave itself unlimited power to punnish dissent subsequently has little incentive to listen to the people it allegedly works for.<br /><br />Such a self-centered country DOES have tremendous incentive to invade other countries and kill the native people---while then seriously wondering why the populations are not eagerly 'praising' American troops. It also attempts to paint itself as pro-American while those troops give their lives at an alarming rate not seen since Vietnam.<br /><br />Instead of making itself safe from outside harm, America has opened itself up to violation from forces within. The sooner we collectively recognize 'the war on terror' is politically loaded language with little practical aplicability to our needs and realities, the better everyone will be.anguage with little practical aplicability to our needs and realities, the better everyone will be.	2004-10-11

Once again defying common sense, Malkin parrots extremist rhetoric for her very few proverbial minutes of fame.<br /><br />This time, she actually believes the internment camps which Japanese Americans were forcibly herded into for World War II protection were not that bad. Even by Malkin's previously absurd standards, this work reaches a new low in fiction.<br /><br />While the United States did not build crematoriums, we still stigmatized people ONLY because of their involuntary demographic membership. We erroneously assumed that Japanese Americans (oddly unlike German and Italian Americans) would endanger America if allowed to roam free. Rather than adopting a realistic policy to protect the country and stop racial hate, America instead allowed panic to reign.<br /><br />Like the German concentration camps, these institutions ultimately were designed to stigmatize their captors; if they were 'normal', people would have not been required to stay there. If these camps are so great, Malkin needs to go live in them herself.<br /><br />For somebody who clearly prides herself on 'independence', Malkin has a lot of nerve to write and then stand by this book. Yes, it may prove that she is sincere in believing these thoughts---but at what consequence to friends, family, or herself?<br /><br />It is also worth noting that people held in the internment camps were not allowed to have a 'media darling' role.	2004-10-11

From the Greenwich Village freethinkers of the 1920s to the new left of the 1960's to the Riot Grrrl movement of the 1990's, progressive organizing's limited regular visibility routinely has been confused with it's actual efficacy.  People tend to distrust what they cannot immediately sense happening in the world.<br /><br />In Going Public, Michael Gecan ( 2002) argues that progressive activism is not a time-specific aberration. Ending injustice and oppression IS everybody's business during every year. Everybody can do something-if they are not already involved within their communities.<br /><br />Urging readers to \\"think nationally, act locally\\" Gecan shows political organizing is really very easy to undertake. Since politics is literally about whom you know and what you each know, relationship processes assume heightened significance in this book. Forgetting all of the glitz and special effects on cable news shows, politics is simply the art of negotiating with others to get what you need. Maintaining good relationships with all levels of government is important to achieving these goals.<br /><br />Gecan is of course critical of big business for exploiting already vulnerable communities, but he also takes a critical eye to social service bureaucracies more enamored with self-preservation than providing service for humanity. Time and political/economic factors subsequently have caused even the best intentioned structures (some of which were ironically initiated by grassroots radicals!) to calcify into self-serving shells of their original mandates. Instead of being viewed as a nurturing force, government social services are thus now viewed by some politicians and constituents as inherently substandard to private sector resources. People who need to use government services (welfare...etc) have also become stigmatized as being substandard themselves. This abhorrent catch 22 keeps the United States noticeably behind our European counterparts in developing national healthcare and maintaining numerous other social welfare programs.<br /><br />Pointing out their still-underutilized potential (and ideological starting point for many now-established bureaucratic agencies) Geacan wants relational culture---non-profits---- to have a bigger role in citizen lives and service delivery.  Stressing the benefits of merit, he also believes the ability to reward AND punish appropriate public sector individuals can provide better results for everybody. Individuals with both incentive and room to innovate in their job theoretically develop a greater attachment to the position as opposed to people who are literally being trained in the art of being a paper-pushing drone.  In a service position, this difference is critical to effective community organizing.<br /><br />Focusing on methodology instead of issues, this book is a clear and enjoyable read for  both activists and potential activists alike. The best activism always comes from something that participants personally have a stake in. Legitimization of political action will ultimately raise the voter turn out rate and then encourage other forms of political participation through default.

Bush is in fact presiding over a government racing to ensure the American people and the world are under his control. He only likes people who can be molded into a perpetual/near-perpetual state of fear.<br /><br />Countless reports (including those from within the government) now openly question the legitimacy of the Iraq invasion. Because Saddam Hussein did not have either the oft-mentioned Weapons of Mass Destruction or ties to Al Quaeda, this military venture has been a ruse to cover the administration's own tail.<br /><br />In true fascist form however, the president and his stand-ins are insisting that anybody who questions their motives is really trying to undermine security and patriotism. Never mind the ease which Haliburton and other oil industry businesses (with convenient) connections to senior administration officials have secured contracts for `post war' Iraq.<br /><br />The only reason why Bush distinguishes himself is the insistence on absolute rule at all costs. The American government's checks and balances system was intentionally created to prevent tyranny. If left totally to their own devices, the Bush team WOULD formally scrap the United States Constitution and other documents which have largely prevented the fraud which was rampant throughout other countries.<br /><br />Even if Mr. Bush does not waffle on issues, his mannerisms pose their own set of problems for good (and certainly safe) government. If the Bush administration felt compelled to lie about their REAL case for invading Iraq and then overthrowing Saddam Hussein, what else are they lying to us about?<br /><br />Like Joe McCarthy in the 1950's the Bush administration exploits people's fear of an uncertain future for explicitly self-centered ends. If we survive these times, America will look back at this era and wonder why so many otherwise rational people had literally allowed themselves to be brainwashed into a perpetual state of fear/panic by the government.<br /><br />I find it significant that so many once ardently Bush conservatives are now reduced to talking about the president's passion and single-mind determination---instead of his ethics and honesty. Because these were allegedly BIG sticking points with the Clinton administration, their double standard is very telling of actual priorities.<br /><br /> As long as George W.

Throughout the latter 20th century, most chief executives had a contradictory response to women, and especially organized feminism.<br /><br />In an effort to win women voters (who apparently preferred Nixon during the 1960 election) and quell simultaneous intra-party controversy over the Equal Rights Amendment (then opposed by organized labor), John F. Kennedy created the President's Commission on the Status of Women. Identifying and recommending changes in the sociolegal status of American women, the PSCW (and by default the Kennedy administration) encouraged the revival of American feminism. Pondering how he would have built on PSCW findings if he had lived is an interesting exercise for today's feminist policy makers.<br /><br />Most people would be hard pressed to call Richard Nixon a liberal feminist, but he supported the Equal Rights Amendment, Affirmative Action, and refrained from attacking the Roe decision (as predecessor Reagan would begin in the 1980 campaign). Nixon appears moderate by some liberal feminist group standards, but Martin fails to explain how the administration's now-disclosed hatred of social justice movements ultimately affected what policies were enacted; if the FBI spied on the women's liberation movement it is safe bet the Nixon White House was in no hurry to align itself with this same cause.<br /><br />Martin gives Jimmy Carter the most credit for advancing women's status prior to the 1990's.Carter not only continued to increase the number of women hired for White House policy positions, but pointedly looked to the feminist movement for his talent pool----hiring Midge Costanza and her successor Sarah Weddington to act as bureaucracy-movement liaison. Carter's wife Rosalyn (who is the first `first lady' to sit in on Cabinet meetings) also obviously influenced how the Carter administration saw and then acted upon gender equity issues.<br /><br />Overall this is a good book for graduate presidency/women in politics classes and selected readings can be assigned to graduate classes.

Although I am a heterosexual, I had always wondered why these people would give so much time, energy, and money to a political party who would (because of the growing southern conservative base) rather see them burnt at the stake than equal partners.<br /><br />To this extent, I originally had believed that LCR's were simply confused individuals who came out of the closet, but secretly longed for the 'mainstream recognition' brought by virtual gay bashers. Because our society is so filled with hate and fear of 'difference' this strategy could actually represent a level of comfort to some people in a time when GLBT people (although not without ongoing challenges) have an easier social and political existence than enjoyed by previous generations. Apparently, I was wrong.<br /><br />Tafel does want equality, but only for gays and lesbians who fit a 'cookie cutter' mold of respectability. Anybody pointing out the world (and public policy) does not operate in that manner becomes castigated. Meanwhile, like heterosexual bigots---Tafel and company's `respectability' serves more to judge and condemn 'other' people than convincingly build their own argument.<br /><br />Unlike homophobes, Tafel...etc then actually has the nerve to wonder why the community cannot take him seriously. He actually does not realize that you cannot proscribe such sexuality and then expect everybody (especially those people falling outside of your stated ideals) to be enthusiastic about your organization and/or yourself.<br /><br />At least the Jerry Falwells of the world admit their rhetoric burns bridges with the community.<br /><br />Because the book is about how great TAFEL's own views are (and conveniently glosses over contradictions) it is not for the serious researcher. This title is something which you would read in the library or pick up at the used bookstore.	2004-09-05

Evans unwittingly squanders the tremendous potential from her initially good intentions.<br /><br />Falling into the same 'post-feminist' trap readers are ironically warned against throughout the text, this book cannot unify second and third wavers. I certainly appreciate and have benefited from the work accomplished during this time period and am personally/professionally friends with individuals, but cannot see how a book ignoring my own generation's political activism is supposed to unify the two generations at large<br /><br />Sharply contrasting with the glowing treatment given to herself and other second wavers, Evans only introduces the third wave as \\"recent participants in a world transformed by their mother's generation\\" (p. 213). In addition to implying that myself and others are really only interloping guests at 'somebody' else's social justice movement, this remark overlooks the critical perspectives we bring precisely as a consequence of growing up without legal segregation, with Title IX, Special Education, and many other programs which were only a dream for her generation.<br /><br />While giving the 'riot grrrl' movement only one paragraph, she is oddly eager to devote much more book space to the faux feminists who made their public names attacking previous feminist theory (p. 221). Agreeing that it made for great mass media sensationalism, I do not accept this latter category as representative of my generation of feminist theorists, and am disappointed by Evans's stereotypes.<br /><br />After ironically establishing how bias keeps women from being aware of their past (p. 38) she then specifically minimizes a feminism (which unlike the drivel by Roiphe, Summers, and Hoff) represented a major public resurgence of progressive ideas. Riot Grrrl theory argued that all forms of oppression are connected although patriarchy under girds this society. Just because something is different from her own generation does not excuse Evans from taking it seriously during the research process.<br /><br />Other truly intergenerational feminist authors previously have argued the movement needs to make genuine efforts either to fully become or remain multigenerational, but Evans is blissfully oblivious to this necessity. In it's current state the book has no academic or personal redeeming quality and substantial revisions are needed to accord equal respect to all feminist generations.girds this society.

This same enviroment unintentionally provided the reinforcement that the white Segrest needed to battle racism begining in the 1960's.<br /><br />Thus, unlike some people who would write this book today only to appear 'politically correct', Segrest has genuine empowerment intentions: She knows that although it is a part of her family's (and the community's past) racisim was not (and is not) right for anybody. It is also possible to love your own family while strongly opposing their politics---and judgements upon yourself.<br /><br />Segrest's innate ability to interconnect various social justice struggles with each other is another strength of this work. Racism, sexism, and homophobia are all different facets of the same bigotry. Preventing full community potential from being realized, all forms of discrimination must be abolished without exception. There is no such thing as 'acceptable' bigotry.<br /><br />Segrest can get too self-righteous at times  for some readers(she is hardly the only person in the world who has worked against her own family's politics!), but this book stil expertly explores a VERY personal and political issue not fully addressed in our supposedly more enlightened times.	2004-08-21

Bush's own now-well documented 'military record' (Defending Texas bars from communism is NOT a life-threatening activity!)and the current administration policies to colonize Iraq for the oil companies which bankroll his campaign, this conservative Republican (in fairness to those Americans of all ideologies easily recognizing campaign fraud when they smell it!) front shamelessly fabricates evidence to suggest that Kerry made up his combat injuries and war record.<br /><br />Funded by a wealthy Texas GOP donor (how convenient this person is from both the president's state and party!) this group intends to dent Kerry's veteran constituency group support. This group is so extreme it ignores all factual and common sense at the expense of electing Bush to his first term.<br /><br />As the relative of Vietnam era vets, I know nobody would fabricate such horrific experiences---or the evident injuries.<br /><br />What a drastic change from the 1992 and 1996 campaigns when the GOP were the ones insisting that a war record affirmed a candidate's presidential ability...and the Democrats (as the better party) refrained from questioning validity of those same claims. Nobody doubted that either George Bush Sr. or Bob Dole had served in World War II or that Dole had been injured.<br /><br />Since numerous previous news investigations and movies (Michael J. Fox's 'Casualties of War') previously acknowledged that some U.S. soldiers DID commit atrocities in Vietnam, I am bewildered by the continuing denial of reality. Despite the extensively documented evidence (and Iraq's current prison abuse scandal) the right wing still honestly insists on believing that war really is as simple as a John Wayne movie or a G.I. Joe cartoon----where good and bad forces are easily identified with zero room for ambiguity. But the fact is that some of our soldiers WERE responsible for atrocities in Vietnam (and other countries around the globe); intra-military testimony is supposed to expose and discontinue those same activities.<br /><br />If right wingers want to be mad at anybody, be mad at the individual soldiers who committed these acts and the superior officers who swept those same activities under the rug of bureaucratic silence. Does their anger at Kerry mean they would have preferred that U.S. soliders be allowed to rape and tourture people? How would such policies have convinced wavering countries that we were better than communism or that the United States was a civilized nation?<br /><br />Several people formerly connected with this project already came clean on national news stories and other veterans courageously are rising against the White House's spin machine.<br /><br />Discounting an idea that only Democrats oppose the group, former Vietnam POW John McCain also expresses public disgust with their tactics---and the Bush campaign's refusal to oppose the allegations (both attacking Kerry's credibility and Bush campaign connections) Disagree with a candidate's voting record, but don't ever make light of the fact they had risked their life OR took a principled position to help other Americans avoid their own first-hand experience with those very same horrors.<br /><br />If they are actually interested in a serious 'credibility' conversation the Bush campaign must do the same.; intra-military testimony is supposed to expose and discontinue those same activities.  <br /> <br />If right wingers want to be mad at anybody, be mad at the individual soldiers who committed these acts and the superior officers who swept those same activities under the rug of bureaucratic silence.

Kennedy (although conservative with equity issues when compared against America's current policy expectations) instituted the President's Commission on the Status of Women during the early 1960's to 'study' and 'recommend' improvements in the status of American women.<br /><br />Forcing America to confront very uncomfortable truths about their socioloegal treatment of women (pregnancy discrimination, wage discrimination...etc) versus the idealized norm on television sitcoms, the PCSW was a veritable star-studded list of prominent women (and some men including Attorney General Robert Kennedy) who had acchieved modest public success in the pre-feminist era. Again reflecting the time, sexuality issues (contraception, abortion, GLBT issues) are noticeably absent from their public discussion. The sheer importance of this document easily compensates for it's now-limited agenda.<br /><br />There are many important reasons why this commission was created.<br /><br />Concerned about the image of 'fairness' during the Cold War, the Kennedy administration also tried to gain the approval of women voters (who actually had preferred Nixon during the 1960 elections) and settle ongoing intra-party skirmishes over the Equal Rights Amendment in an era when unions and many first wave feminists still believed that only women should receive workplace 'protection'. The Kennedy administration was also attempting to blunt criticism for not appointing at least one woman to a cabinet position.<br /><br />In their final report (October 1963) the commission essentially forecast the rise of American feminism's \\"second wave\\" if the reported conditions did not drastically change. America was unable to continue as it had been doing, and 'women's concerns' WERE serious business. The commission did not fully predict the future, but it knew the country had to acknowledge the damaging effects of sex discrimination.<br /><br />However limited from our current policy research models (too much generalizing on the experiences of white middle class heterosexuals without disabilities) the presidential backing behind an investigation of women's current rights obviously prompted other American women to begin asking questions about their own status. Women once considering their PCSW work 'radical' then began looking for other opportunities where their newly minted knowledge could be applied.<br /><br />The commission's obvious lack of enforcement power had prompted some PSCW veterans and author Betty Friedan to form the National Organization for Women (1966). Through conscious public action, JFK ultimately helped to revive American feminism.e the damaging effects of sex discrimination.

It would be easy for him to turn this into a partisian spat, but he takes the higher route by focusing on American government substance.<br /><br />People from all political parties warped the checks-and-balances system for their own personal/political ends. Because the government is ultimately neither Democrat or Republican, we (people of all parties) need to actually think and act bipartisan to restore and then keep the U.S. Government at it's prime.<br /><br />I was honestly suprised by the fluid text throughout this work. This is a work that both I and friends/family who are NOT in politics actively can enjoy on it's merits.

Like imprinted fabric, these women are shamelessly used to mask the real impacts of Bush administration public policy. Whether it 'works' or fails, Bush only brought women into the administration to absorb negative critcisim.<br /><br />Since the original publication of this book, Karen Hughes left her White House communications post. Hughes had to learn the hard way that working for the president was not at all like working for the Texas Governor (a figurehead position) and the public expects immediate results and statements (especially in the digital age). There are no hours when the president can declare an actual vacation or break from duties because it is a 24-7 job.<br /><br />With the war on terror now monopolizing national and local newscasts, another interesting study is Dr. Condoleeza Rice. This highly trained individual is featured so often during press grillings, that I honestly believe Bush is only interested in appointing the women so he can hide behind them when something goes wrong. Ongoing discussions of Rice's own presidential potential are now quickly tempered by how she handles herself (or not) during these admittedly terse moments when EVERYTHING counts.<br /><br />Rather than announce his own personal incompetence, Bush believes that he can pin the blame for failed public policies on subordinates--who just happen to be female. Blaming other people is a pattern which the Bush family encourages it's members to follow but (as daddy's 1992 campaign demonstrated) is not sufficent for the presidency.<br /><br />In addition to enacting the conservative policies Bush wants, this strategy may have hidden long-term effects on future high-level appointments and working women in general.<br /><br />The ultimate failures of the Bush administration's women may encourage (despite substantial previous progress made against such gender stereotypes) the public to believe that women in general cannot handle certain government positions and their appointment will bring disaster for the country. Because the right-wing was previously openly unable to eliminate workplace and education non-discrimination laws, they instead resorted to inserting three-dimensional retrograde stereotypes in government.ointments and working women in general.

A combination of personal ignorance and Texan bravado has merged to formulate a being who cannot and will not think of women as his equals.<br /><br />Long gone are the days when Republican president Gerald R. Ford openly supported women's equality through public policies such as equal pay and the ERA ratification campaign, etc...The only thing diverse about Bush is his appointment of other women to enact the retrograde policies to intentionally undo the last thirty years of progress they themselves have ironically benefited from.<br /><br />Bush's chilling goal is for all of us to end up like his wife Laura, a robo-wife not allowed to have any public oppinions unless her husband thinks they will somehow support his goals. In this same world, our differing ideas (especially about reproductive issues) will be kept under wraps.<br /><br />Some of this basic premise was previously covered in Tanya Melich's 'War Against Women' (1996) which took an insider's look at how/why the late 20th century Republican Party intentionally began attacking women's rights.<br /><br />While she is an outsider who has never voted Republican, Flander's work benefits from the timeliness and 'pop' format unavailable in Melich's public confession. Serious topics (and alarming statistics) are condensed into the 'sound bite' read which our culture obviously thrives on.<br /><br />Buy a copy for yourself, and then purchase copies for all the women in your life who believe there is no important difference between the major political parties during this election season.

Instead, he uses his famous name to sell a book that does not contribute to the pro-choice cannon. The lack of quality research might even inadvertently toughen present organizing conditions for people such as myself who currently work the policy trenches without benefit of celebrity.<br /><br />While he muses about the Sadie Sachs story which propelled his grandmother to open the first birth control clinic in America, he asks us to find common ground with the people who want nothing more than to see that myself and other women are returned to similar conditions.<br /><br />Ultimate unworkability of that aforementioned public policy oddly does not deter Sanger from his daydream.  He continues to believe that the rest of the world is universally awed by the tale and the rightwing is only interested in recriminalizing abortion. Current evidence from Planned Parenthood Federation of America itself indicates the American rightwing opposes all sexuality outside of procreation but cannot publicly act on their real sentiments for fear of massive public outrage.<br /><br />To be fair, Sanger proactively identifies the numerous flaws within his grandmother's political organizing-which was genuinely considered progressive during her life. In an obviously personally difficult chapter, he concedes that she worked with Eugenicists and let the south warp birth control into a system to shrink African Americans. Because it would have been easier to tout the homogenized family history and ignore `alternate' perspectives such as Dorothy Roberts, he performs a great reader service. Reproductive rights must include all options for all women regardless of ethnicity and/or disability.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he looses the audience again with a chapter on men's role in the reproductive rights movement. Is Sanger trying to increase women's equality or keep their sexuality in check lest society become too independent? He also fails to identify that men have always marched for reproductive rights---while the `liberal' mass media presents these same events as \\"women only\\". Sanger falls into a similar trap by lamenting the passive reproductive issues position men take. Because they were the ones historically ruling if women could have access to contraception and/or abortion (and both physicians and judges until recently were overwhelmingly male) they played a very active reproductive policy role.<br /><br />This book is certainly interesting from the `insider' perspective, but it does not provide any riveting insight for myself or other pro-choice advocates. If somebody else had written this same book it would quickly become one title of many. Since there is no current shortage of reproductive issue controversies, Sanger's book fell short of my expectations.  Get the book for the `history' perspective, but don't expect path breaking content or something that can be applied to today's reproductive policy debate.t.

Her mother (unable to read or write herself)gave her daughter a special dress to wear so she can successfully represent the family's rapidly rising expectations in Philadelphia.<br /><br />In addition to formal educational instruction, Addy learns that not every person is friendly and bigotry is not confined to white southerners whom she had escaped from in the first book (Meet Addy). For whatever reason, some other African Americans look down upon people trying to escape slavery and obtain their freedom.<br /><br />A classmate named Harriet openly pretends she is better than other classmates because her family has enjoyed freedom longer. The teacher's quick intervention reminds students in 19th century America that all African Americans are subordinated and freedom depends on each student working together inside their community. In this high pressure environment intra-communty attacks are not appropriate because all African Americans (including the attack initator) will be rendered vulnerable to discrimination.<br /><br />Thus, Addy practices her lessons by teaching her mother how to read using dough in their boarding house room. Possessing maturity beyond her physical years, Addy understands her mom also needs to read. In addition to increasing her employability this will enable the mother/daughter relationship to remain as the two live and work in Philadelphia. If only Addy knew how to read, the mother would become disproportionately dependent upon her own daughter for basic survival needs.<br /><br />The segregated northern schooling where Addy recieves the coveted education might be difficult to explain to some young people who had grown up believing the South only had the practice, but this title is another prize addition to the American Girls series.<br /><br />Examining American history through the eyes of a young girl, Porter reassures her pre-adolescent target audience things are not always supposed to be easily understood upon first encounter.

For instance, Jehovah's Witnesses do not personally believe in undergoing blood/organ transfusions, but they are respectful enough to avoid terrorizing the local medical facilities which do offer these services.<br /><br />In this gripping work, Risen traces the evolution of the American anti-choice movement. Disatisfaction with the pace of action from early days naturally gave rise to a violent 'fringe' who were actually known to the 'respectable' movement leaders---if not publically supported by these same figures. The early theory held the resulting good/bad cop routine would enable the mainstream anti-abortion movement leaders to ban the procedure faster than if they were the only ones working in the movmenet.<br /><br />Because there are many books analyzing these actions from a second-person perspective and draw exclusively on the testimony of pro-choice activists and/or public officials, it is important that he included interviews with the perpetrators themselves. Personally pro-choice, he is nevertheless critical of intra-movement organizing tactics which inadvertently allowed anti-abortion protestors to gain critical ground in Wichita and elsewhere. Good organizing also involves the ability of a person and their allies to know when and how to self-scrutinize actions for future improvement plans.<br /><br />Still disagreeing with individuals who would restrict reproductive rights for others and especially the violent protestors, I now understand the extent of their political network and enduring impact on American politics.

In 2001, William Jefferson \\"Bill\\" Clinton exited the White House after becoming the first two-term Democratic president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Instead of praise for surmounting numerous and incredible life obstacles, his rags-to-riches personal life story actually had the right wing seriously enraged enough to attempt a sham impeachment and conviction on anything (and EVERYTHING) they thought up. The reception discrepancy between his personal history and presidential administration is painstakingly explored in the personal autobiography---with no detail spared. I am not fortunate enough to live near a city where Clinton undertook book promotion tours, but this title's price vs. length and quality is  well worth those televised all-night camp outs.<br />Eschewing a ghost-writer, Clinton personally poured his heart and mind about personal and potentially difficult subjects which former presidents (of all ideologies) shielded themselves from. Choosing the less-utilized \\"open disclosure\\" route is a refreshing contribution to American public policymaking. It is also one which more public officials should follow.<br />Rather than seeing diversity as an election strategy, Clinton genuinely appreciates social justice movements which attempt to make the world radically different from his Arkansas boyhood. In the television era's early days, then-Governor Orval Fabus tried to maintain segregation `standing in front of the schoolhouse door' to Little Rock's Central High School (pp. 38-39) Undoubtedly this incident's horror (and fears that all southerners were presumed to agree with Faubus) helped solidify determination to pursue a radically contrasting racial public policy legacy (pp. 559-560). In turn, Clinton's early decision explains why I and many other people love him today.<br />Repeatedly, Clinton draws upon his witness to the 1957 Little Rock action as one motivator for public service (the other of course is meeting President Kennedy at a D.C. Boys Town Summit).  Because I am also growing up in a conservative southern town, I am comforted things do change; a young Republican who openly cheered during the announcement of President Kennedy's assassination later became a Democrat, social worker, and one of Clinton's biggest political supporters (p. 65). The bigger person recognizes when it is time to mend the oft-mentioned political fences. During his Arkansas Governorship Clinton demonstrated the nation only maximum potential when all demographics are empowered to participate in the American dream.<br />I also enjoyed reading personal family anecdotes---including those which are probably still painful to share with audiences. In fifth grade, he learned that people who rented out motels for long periods of time did abortions (p. 29) because the procedure was illegal in the state. He also describes the incidents where stepfather Roger beat the family---until young Bill grew big enough to fight back (pp. 45-51). The vivid descriptions provide both literary action and a solemn reminder the world is better because abortion is legalized, and domestic violence is no longer a `family affair'. As a child of divorce, I am also reassured that an American President went through several of the same experiences me and many of my friends experienced. When he talks about families, Clinton is personally aware there are many different types of families and the rightwing has never spoken for everybody (pp. 633-636)<br />As the first president to be in the delivery room during his child's birth (p. 273), Clinton brought unprecedented sensitivity to the Oval Office. Because the lives of American voters are more egalitarian, this empathy is a definite asset in the post-cold war era From his own personal experiences, Clinton easily understands that good and strong families come in all compositions (pp. 426-427). I was also intrigued to learn that Clinton did not personally/politically have a problem with Hillary's last name (p. 296).

At one time I had liked his ideas, but sensed a stench of removal during the infamous 2000 elections.<br />At least with this title he is no longer pretending he had a deep loyalty to the Green Party (who are really nice people) and is only interested in marketing himself. All of the genuinely laudable career achievements like seatbelt laws are diminished under the weight of personal screed. Despite obvious evidence to the contrary, he maintains there are no differences between the Democratic and the Republican Parties----and his independent candidacy is the only pure alternative.<br />The problem is that this aforementioned process is not (and never was) social justice.  Precisely because of his own historical  notoriety, Mr. Nader envisions fair wages, reproductive choice, and GLBT rights as abstract policy issues---while the rest of us are currently working in the trenches for these very causes with relative obscurity and poverty.<br />Nader's rhetoric curiously apes the same actions undertaken by the Republican Party under the homeland security mantra. To reach his point, Nader had to openly ignore significant policy research on the Bush administration and relatively recent news releases because Bush allegedly stands against everything he has worked for---and has made no secret about the ideological allegiances.<br />The superficial courting of the Log Cabin Republicans, which had occurred during the 2000 campaign season, has openly been replaced by strengthened alliances with the social conservatives who are uncomfortable with GLBT rights. While I also marvel at LCR's naivet&eacute;, surely Nader realizes (in his own oft-invoked conscience) that who is elected president does make a big difference for public policy---and the fate of the nation.<br />Because a party is not carrying him this time, Nader (if somehow elected) would have an even more difficult time getting anything he wanted passed into law-while stopping opposed policies. Legislators of different parties and/or ideologies would easily be able to summon enough votes against a chief executive who was that disdainful of the process. For a one-time political insider, this environment would be especially disastrous because he would have nothing to show the very few lingering supporters. Finally, this gridlock would be largely grassroots (instead of ideology or interest-driven) in the ultimate irony.<br />I also don't think this book did enough to address voter fraud and discrepancies existing in the United States electoral system. Having a serious discussion about democracy when people are unable to experience it in their own communities is irresponsible. In a globalized publishing market, ideas within this book must also ring hollow for the Iraqi people whose country is being colonized under fabricated evidence.<br /> The best way to close the Democracy gap is to recognize Nader is now only interested in electing the most radical of Republicans---and actually does not care what communities are disenfranchised in the processcted) would have an even more difficult time getting anything he wanted passed into law-while stopping opposed policies.

If they existed, the 'bad' people were supposedly easily cordoned off into separate areas of town--instead of being your friends, neighbors, or even yourself.<br />What is not very shocking today was the mid twentieth century eqivalent of having to slow down and gawk at a traffic accident.<br />In her short career, Grace Metalious held up the proverbial social mirror and forced people to confront two very critical truths about themselves. They LOVED material like this, and they also led very closely simmilar lives to the characters in this book. Whether it was intended or not, the book helped people in simmilar sittuations see they were not alone, and the fictionalized characters also went through their own trials.	2004-06-22

In the 1960's, many male leaders of the new left only defined revolution in terms of whatever affected men only. Women's issues such as reproduction were quickly labeled trival matters and it was supposedly best that status quo restrictions remain on women's sexuality such as the then-criminalization of abortion (originally done when all surgery was potentially fatal). The idea that women are entitled to our own bodies was a long way in reaching some of these men,<br />Apparently it only reached Dennis Kucinich when he decided to run for president. Since the Democratic Presidential nominee had to court pro-choice groups, he attempted a quick switch, Fortunately we saw through the act and have exposed him for the chauvinist he will always be.<br />Because Representative Kucinich had openly enjoyed restricting women's own rights to their own bodies until there was an inkling he could be the Democratic presidential nominee, I can never take him seriously as the 'progressive' candidate.<br />Believing that we progressive Democrats were naive enough to forget the party has many Roman Catholic officials who support reproductive rights specifically as social justice (Ted and Patrick Kennedy, John Kerry), he attempted to portray this as only a matter of concience.<br />Funny how he did not care about women's right to life after they obtain a back alley abortion in desperation---circumstances which he undoubtedly was previously briefed on by various community groups, but did not seem to care then,<br />He also did not care about the First Amendment which clarifies this nation is strong because of it's separation of church and state. Even if a policy violated his religion, it was important to remember legalized abortion did not violate the practices of other faith perspectives.<br />His concience actually allowed thousands of  young, international, and low-income women to get slaughtered by quacks when a physician would have been able to provide the ethical treatment he is newly interested in,s newly interested in,	2004-05-20

Poised to run for the presidency in 2008, Hillary Clinton's life took her from  \\"Goldwater Girl\\" in suburban America to \\"Campus activist\\" at Wellesley and Yale to corporate lawyer, and then the White House.<br />From the moment Bill Clinton launched his 1992 campaign, Hillary Rodham Clinton became a lighting rod for this country's ideas about women and our rights. Although it was obvious the 'average woman' was different than 30 years ago, we did not collectively want to admit the shift until epitomized by the new First Lady.<br />Not glossing over the author's flaws or those of friends/family, this book is very different than most biographies-especially those written by public figures. We ultimately see a woman whose politics evolved over time, but her love of family and community remain constant. Reading the `family' vignettes also reminded me that these are real people instead of the one-dimensional images presented through the mass media. They eat, sleep, breathe, and watch TV just like any one of us.<br />Like other mothers around the country, Hillary panicked when her child was going off to college and arrived with contact paper in an attempt to make peace with her own separation anxieties. I laughed as I easily pictured these people driving their own daughter nuts in her new dorm room and found comfort that many families have gone through that same experience which I had with my own parents.<br />Because I am a campus activist and aspiring politician myself, reading this memoir was very inspiring. Simply having made it this far in her own life has required Clinton to stand up for the rights of other women in America and around the world. In the face of much criticism from the American right (who still believes everybody lives a fairytale life) she is a truth-teller who will not rest until women's rights are universal. This focus on women's freedom is a genuine concern, and not an activity undertaken for appearances sake....the book makes it clear that she is more interested/involved in women's rights than the 'liberal' mass media has disclosed.<br />Hillary acknowledges her critics, but is very careful to avoid using her book to attack people. It is far more productive to acknowledge your own internal flaws while not dwelling on the motivations of those who are predisposed to hate you simply for existing. This is called taking the political high road.<br />The only flaw with this book is such a dynamic woman is continuing to chart history at such a rapid pace that another edition or volume will certainly have to be written. Standing alone, this version cannot do her (or championed social causes) justice. I eagerly await these new versions.he is more interested/involved in women's rights than the 'liberal' mass media has disclosed. <br />Hillary acknowledges her critics, but is very careful to avoid using her book to attack people.

Bush	Books	5	131	167	N	N	Even Republicans are embarassed by Bush	Having served in the White House with 'Tricky Dick' Nixon, Dean personally knows what a corupt presidency looks, acts, and smells like from the very begining. I am still not crazy about his own past, but at least Mr. Dean has the intellegence to avoid playing Mr. High-and-mighty, even when it is deserving in cases such as these.<br />Like Barry Goldwater before him, Dean is a very rare breed of political animal. A conservative Republican with an intact and functioning social concience about the current state of affairs directly because of his own party's doing. I probally disagree with Dean on many other issues, but we know the country cannot be protected from terrorism while blowing it up. It is maddening this nation is in another 'Watergate' era.<br />Because Dumbya's father became the CIA director (in the Ford Administration) immediately following the Watergate scandal,  today's Iraq international intervention was signifigantly less shocking to myself than somebody who had previously taken everything at face value. The son is simply governing in the manner that his father modeled as being normal.<br />Unlike the rest of America scandals and international destabilization are routine occurences for the Bush family. The only good government is a government that can be reconfigured to meet the will of their corporate friends. This is why the White House remains so aghast that the rest of the nation and the world do not share their bloodthirst.<br />The only reason why somebody would not like this book is they are one of the few people who somehow continue naively believing in Dubya's 'good boy' image while overlooking the good ole boys convieniently installed all around him. The slickness that was supposedly so abohorent in predecessor Clinton's administration is welcomed here in greater intensity only because of party and ideological differences<br />This book will become a venerable classic.	2004-04-28

That was, until I actually read through the patronizing story.<br />'Bad Helen' recieved her nickname because she repeatedly acts up in class due to frustration with a learning disability. Her school knows that she is elgible for services but for the sake of the story, she is in the 'regular' classroom with a teacher who has made it clear that she does not like Helen for who she is. Having special education students in the regular classroom only works if the teacher is not insulting the student.<br />Even today, I am amazed by the number and severity of plot holes. Nobody (including the parents) seems alarmed that Helen is not recieving the help she is entitled to get under state/federal special education laws. This sends/reinforces historical stereotypes that special education (instead of the discrimination people using it experience) is bad and undesirable.<br />Now as then, this book may be the only 'public' information on special education that some students recieve---especially about themselves. Ms. Declements could have performed a tremendous public service for her readers (ala Henry Winkler's Hank Zipster) but instead exploits fear of being different. Furthermore, naive parents who are afraid of their children's diagnosis also turn to juvenile literature to reasure the whole family of an uncertain future. This book harms the very populations it could be trying to obtain primary readership from.	2004-04-22

Bush. My Texas residency (and previous years of state required Texas Goverment/History courses) meant that I had seen the worst of Bush up close...or so I thought.<br />Even when I previously said Bush was plotting to destroy the world with his oil industry buddies (who non-coincidentally are also daddy's friends), part of me believed this was a joke. Surely, the American people (the Congress included) would prevent such extremisim from acutually occuring in any context?<br />9/11 was tragic, but the surealism quickly surounding the event aftermath makes Joe McCarthy's anti-communist crusade look like a fine tuned amusement park ride for the kiddos. Exploiting the national sentiment, Bush began to colonize Iraq (replete with Colonial Governor Bremmer) and honestly cannot figure out why the people of Iraq are not excited about trading in one ruthless dictator for another.<br />Once again living up to his reputation as America's (if not one of the world's) best investigative journalists, Woodward explains why the president remains eager to talk about weapons of mass destruction despite the mountains of fabricated evidence now uncovered. Bush is so welded to the idea of conquering Iraq at all costs that he is even ignoring a growing intra-party dissent which is usually unheard of except in times of extreme turmoil (LBJ and Vietnam, Nixon and Watergate) which would otherwise spell defeat for both the sitting president and their party.<br />Bush's actions folks, are an impeachable and convictable offense.<br />This is also the reason why Bush is so eager to renew the Patriot Act despite (again) Congress's rapid unease with supposedly anti-terrorist legislation. Congress and the American people fear (and rightly so) that the broad powers of this act give Bush free mandate to lash out at whatever he wants in whatever manner he wants, letting somebody else worry about the consequences of their mess. The president comes off sounding incompetent because he actually is.<br />Notice that the reccent Bush campaign material is focused entirely on economic cuts instead of the character/morals issue which was allegedly so important four years ago. Finally, it is telling that many Republicans and conservatives are praising this book for revealing the president's country-endangering flaws during the much-hyped 'war on terror'.es of their mess.

Receiving my own feminist awakening during 1992's 'year of the woman', I remain interested in women's impact within and upon public policy. Because their increasing public participation can no longer seriously be treated as a 'fad', women's public policy participation is inevitable in the 21st century.<br />They were comparatively naive about race/ethnicity, socioeconomic, and disability issues compared to our modern 'progressive' standards, but 19th century reformers (also working for women's suffrage) understood that government would only reflect women's needs if women gained access into this same system.<br />From parks to safe milk/food, women were responsible for some of the monumental policies affecting the quality of life for all people. The 'non-partisan/non-political' current nature of these same reforms obscures the fundamental challenge the women posed to traditional constructions of the state.<br />Because the government was not initially concerned with social welfare (and consigned related tasks to the private sector and/or non-governmental charities) this transformation had a tremendous impact on how everybody thought about public sector responsibilities. Today it is a given that the government provides/should provide pure food, schools and healthcare programs to the most vulnerable populations.<br />Blissfully far from publicly lampooned bean-counting (which wrongfully implies feminist leaders care more about demographic numbers than administrative competence), feminist policymaking sharply differs from traditional models.<br />We realize that the virtues ascribed in a technically gender-neutral government are 'masculine', and women attempting to enter public service in this same system (including education and social services) are accused of stepping outside their gender and attempting to be substitute men. The success of some women in this earlier system temporarily masks its harm upon all people.	2004-02-07

Since the governor is constitutionally limited to a figurehead role, a former party boy such as Bush would be somebody's puppet---with very disasterous results for the country. The results he was claiming as a campaign record was really somebody else's very hard work.<br />If you have not done so already, stop guessing because the puppet master is daddy (Bush Sr.) and their big business friends. Apparently enraged about loosing the White House in 1992 (funny how the GOP usually attacks public housing residents except when they are the residents!) the Republicans swore revenge against the Democratic Party AND America itself.<br />Instead of being an abberation, the much hyped Florida election scandal was a warm-up act for our far worse current sittuation. A pledge to find Osama Bin Laden magically transformed into a hunt for Weapons of Mass Destruction, before once again changing into a mandate to remove Saddam Hussein from office supposedly for the good of the country. It is also little wonder that Ricin was found at the U.S. Capitol building the very day long-awaited hearings on the Bush administration's internal policy failures were supposed to convene.<br />Keep this book by your side as you (try to) watch the administration's publically televised speeches (however painfull/hillarious the proces) and see how many people from Bush I share ties to the current administration. Logic has little bearing on policy decsisions when you are a power hungry elitist who cannot bring themselves to understand the American government has a duty to all people.<br />I know the U.S. political process has reached a sorry state of affairs when I reflect back to the early days of the Bush regime. Then the worst myself (and anybody with common sense) imagined him doing was taking away our reproductive rights or setting up a white house office of religion, both of which are very penny ante compared to the depravity we've actually been subjected to in the name of 'national security'.<br />The Bushes may be attempting to create a Republican answer to the Kennedy's but even at their worst, the latter actually understood the importance of giving a caring veneer towards less fortunate populations. By contrast, the Bushes seem genuinely offended at having to realize that women want sociopolitical equality, and there are other religions in the United States beyond fundamentalist Christianity.<br />History will judge the Bush family as a horrible experiment foisted upon the American people.

Short of a miracle, the Republican-controlled Congress will attempt minimize these presidential discretions, no matter how much they endanger national security.<br />The 'blanket' title is mandatory because an in-your face approach is needed for times like these.

I previously heard about it from friends who are members of the reformed Mormon church, believing they and their female family members were entitled to human dignity. In otherwords, this title no longer speaks authoritatively even for the original core audience it was supposed to connect with.<br />Apparently this very title was THE in-thing in the 1950's and 1960's for training women to become 'good' members of the general church. If nothing else, it makes an excellent case study how litterature can effectively program and control people's minds. Andelin instructs women to become docile big children and let the husband have the self-esteem and encouragement instead of dispersing it equally throughout the whole family unit.<br />Blissfuly unaware of the realities of marriage (then and now) Andelin promotes a profoundly backwards approach to relationships. According to this mindset, people will not like you unless you can successfuly transform yourself into a fairy tale and expend your valuable energy keeping that same act up. Frankly, books like these make me very ashamed to be a member of the human race because they go well beyond other right-wing sociopolitical works (including Schafly)in subordinating women.<br />Sure the cover says the work is updated for the most current printing, but seriously who wants a life partner (if possible) who talks baby talk and is unable to think for themselves. It seems to me that this same enviroment invites the potential for extramarital affairs, the 'good' men become bored with the 'helpmate' and search for a woman who they can have a conversation with.<br />If nothing else, economic reality of the current basic cost-of-living requires women to participate in the public sector.

I appreciate the openess (since kids are much smarter than we give them credit for, the insemination would not upset children) of this book, but the lack of color is tricky in a children's book.<br />I have read some excellent 'current issue' children's fiction books which succeed in telling their story (and inspiring creative thinking) without using color (Days with Daddy) but the lines in those stories were well-defined. The hazy presentation of this book will ironically make it difficult to talk with kids about so-called alternative families. The most open message in the world becomes cold and inviting if it cannot appeal to the eye of the intended reader.<br />Plus, if colors convey mood, this same decision may inadvertently suggest the women and Heather are engaged in something secretive and not as valid when compared against the activities of status quo idealized heterosexual families. Ms. Newman may have completely different politics, but she seems to echo the far right's endless admonitions about sexuality and youth with the layout.<br />Future editions need to have clear color graphics throughout the text.Art is not benign, but a political statement as important as carefuly crafted text. It is difficult for children to be excited/proud about their families (or the existence of GLBT families) after reading a book which seems gloomy.	2004-01-11

Past mono-discipline efforts understandably released incomplete, contradictory, and ultimately unhelpful studies. The picture generated only represented a selective fraction of what actually existed.<br />Miron, Torres and Inda eloquently bring historically separate social science disciplines together for social change where other people have previously and currently failed.<br />Ranging from case studies to quantitative analysis, the collection essays examine why race and ethnicity continue to be a controversial part of America. Bureaucrats and their constituents react negatively (even with open hostilities) because we subconciously fear what is different from our own immediate enviroment. It is also easier to blame these different groups for our real and percieved misfortune (such as the overseas relocation of factory jobs) than to critically examine the specifics of initially benign-sounding policies and our own (quiet) compliance for not applying the critical eye.<br />Aidia Hurtado's essay &quot;The trickster's play&quot; exposes the racism 'liberal' whites inadvertently engage in when they telling people of color just how damaged they are by racism and attempt to negate the critical different experiences between various ethnicities through 'color-blind' policies,  subconciously denying racism's very existence.<br />Although other works such as This Bridge Called My Back (1982) do a far more comprehensive job of intergrating women of color into their policy prescriptions, the section on gender pointedly reminds readers they are constantly obligated to consider how gender and other subordinate idenities intrsect with each other. In the sociopolitical hierarcy of American society, the low income non-white woman was historically (and currently) branded as the least valuable society member. It is most telling that the same perpetrators are only begining to be held accountable now, but the global community clearly has a long way to go.historically (and currently) branded as the least valuable society member.

There has been much discussion about conscience, character, and morals within the public sector and what quantities of these ingredients are required of 'good' public servants versus those that simply keep getting re-elected for tradition sakes---but Thurmond's life (long overdue for an examination) lacks all three components.<br />After former South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond's death, a woman Essie Mae Washington came forward with revelation that she was Thurmond's half-daughter. Her mother was a teenage African American worker in the Thurmond home, and he was a wealthy young adult whose activities were apparently concealed for fear of dominant society retaliation. If word of Thurmond's 'extracurricular' activities had leaked out while he was living, (especially in the segregation era) it would have been the end of his political career.<br />I don't doubt that the incident (and others) in question happened, or Strom's legendary libido (ironically while courting voters from 'family values' crowd who made a national crisis out of President William Jefferson Clinton's consensual affair with a twenty something adult woman). Apparently because Ol'Strom forces himself on women far less powerful than himself, this is not only appropriate conduct but an expected public service perk that he was not in a hury to give up. Throughout his 'distinguished' life, Thurmond regarded women as objects for his convenience and entertainment, unable to consider us full and three-dimensional people.<br />I am not shocked by the lurid details contained within this volume, but I sincerely hope conservatives and/or Republicans understand what allegations are in here before continuing to pretend only one political party houses ravenous libidos. Letting neither his switch to the Republican party or increasing age stop him, Strom remained the consummate womanizer, quickly falling out of step with an era that (at least in public relations) saw the importance of treating women as professional equals.<br />Thurmond's death was one of the 2003 newstories, but it is ultimately telling of his supreme inhumanity that none of the Sunday talk shows devoted significant time to memorializing his influence on the nation.

In the 1990's due to a combination of aging out of roles, being able to be more selective about the roles he did take...etc Fox appeared in less but I adored the seasons he was on \\"Spin City\\".<br />Usually not impressed by celebrity books, I was intrigued by advance publicity to request this title for a Christmas gift. The medium sized book is a non-airbrushed portrait of a man who is simutaneously closer and farther away from his on camera image than the public may have initally realized. There is some general commentary on hollywood simply because that was the source of his and Tracy's paycheck but the meat of the book is ultimately soul-baring conversations.<br />Revealing the imperfect truth behind the public facade (the massive drinking!) the autobiography expertly avoids the easy trap too many other celebrities (especially those dealing with chronic illness) plunge headfirst into while on the road to selling their story. People with disabilities ARE vibrant active HUMAN people whose condition is only one facet of their total experience and contribution to the human society.<br />Even if he did not intend this while filming the project in the mid 1980's, I had ironically looked to Fox's \\"Teen Wolf\\" for cultural inspiration how to handle being a youth with disabilities when I was the only 'different' person in my family/neighborhood/school and wanted to know this discrepancy was cool. It was bittersweet irony therefore when I read the text indicating he was not as initially as accepting of his own body and the resultant adjustments which were made such as having to see a neurologist and take medication to keep some of the symptoms from showing themselves in public.<br />Pictures of referenced people and/or events would have been interesting, but reading a word-only celebrity book was more intimate. Not only would it invade the person's privacy, but the same oft-used concept would divert attention from the story AND mood, creating an experience that was no different from most of the other titles currently on the market. Due to my own challenging life, I rarely cry while reading/viewing something, but the sheer honesty of Fox's perspectivr had me constantly reaching for the Kleenex and experiencing a genuine sense of awe.<br />Fox is never going to be a master thespian, but he will always  be one of the world's good people who tried to leave it in a better condition than he found it. That is real star power in my book.f referenced people and/or events would have been interesting, but reading a word-only celebrity book was more intimate.

We were regularly encouraged to read books about groups outside of our own and develop a strong sense of fairness.<br />While we did not have a chance to read this book during our own childhoods, I can vouch it is an important library addition for any parent wanting their child to grow up secure enough with themselves so they do not pick on others and/or deal with personal problems.<br />In his age-appropriate text (although the 'roomate' terminology is confusing after the depth of description), Willhoite demonstrates there are all kinds of good families. Both Daddy and Frank are very interested in providing a safe and stable enviroment for the youth---and enjoy an apparently supportive relationship with the mother (finding out you are the spouse of a GLBT person is not an easy position in our society) making his own growth an innately easier journey.<br />Not fancy by today's computer-pumped standards, the illustrations help reinforce the true meaning of caring. It is ultimately how you treat yourself and others which should determine what happens. Thus, the book purposefully ignores the possibility of daddy and Frank being hate crime and/or discrimination victims, a scenario which may worry older children after a parent's disclosure.<br />Realizing there are other families across the USA for whom the journey is nowhere near as smooth, I appreciate the candor attempting to end the cycle of hate-depression which takes a heavy toll on our youth. Like GLBT people themselves, the children of GLBT parents (a growing category!) have few 'safe' resources to utilize.<br />That many school districts and libraries outside of 'GLBT mecca's' do not  presently stock this title unless a battle ensues ultimately reveals more about their fear of the 'different' and unfamiliar, than any inherent flaws within this book (and simmilar titles). Isolating the children of GLBT parents and potential heterosexual alies is much more simple than recognizing and overcoming our own bigotry.and potential heterosexual alies is much more simple than recognizing and overcoming our own bigotry.	2003-12-08

Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception	Books	5	45	60	N	N	Please read me in these very scary times	During the 2000 presidential election, candidate Bush had the nerve to insist that he was the remedy to Washington politics. A gullible minority of American voters, Florida election officials and the United States Supreme Court actually believed him....placing us where they are now.<br />Bush's only previous political experience was serving as Texas Governor (a figurehead position with no actual power) but his family was savvy enough to surround him with people who knew how to skillfully manipulate images to their benefit.<br />With the news now attempting to play catch-up critic on the war in Iraq, it is a painful revelation for many Bushies their former 'golden-boy' has signifigant tarnish, and this particular tarnish is endangering the country. If character is supposedly a critical personal component for the Commander in Chief, it naturally begs that the same individual would not fabricate evidence about a war---- including the war itself.<br />Hundreds of millitary members have given their lives so Bush could further exploit the initial support from the 9/11 attacks (themselves now comming under suspicion) and do whatever he wanted when ever he wanted. Because of his fame and wealth, he viewed the presidency not as a responsibility or a honor but an entitlement. Because he is the president, he is allowed to wreck the country in his own immage.<br />This also explains why people within the president's own party (normally a politically no-no for a 'wartime president') are openly challening him on policy issues they were once content to go along with. Bush may have the 2004 Republican nomination at this point, but if political developments are suggesting anything---the nominating process itself will hardly be set.	2003-12-03

Having battled my own share of standardized testing programs, I wish there was a 'zero' star option.<br />Confusing rote obedience with intelligence, the authors selectively ignore cases (I and many others) that could not pass our state's standardized exams (now the political vogue) yet maintain a 4.0 average, ironically the mark of excellence. This is not an accident or misprint, but reflects a calculated war against anybody labeled different.<br />Because schools can no longer exclude students with disabilities (and higher education institutions must admit otherwise qualified individuals) standardized testing programs prey on politicians fear and ignorance of this changed landscape, and subconscious longing to return to a supposedly more serene time when we were either barred----or allowed to attend only under the blessing of individual family connections. That this earlier arrangement also did not measure an individual's real intelligence and academic capabilities was less important than feeding stereotypes routinely confusing disability with inability.<br />Unlike components for the general degree plan, the 'accommodations' option (regardless of how simple the provision such as a four function calculator, colored overlays etc...) for Texas's higher education testing program is not available at every state institution, wrongfully implying that disability is an 'extra', and reinforcing the idea students with disabilities are not 'real' members of the academic community. Once we are devalued, it is easier to justify overall discrimination against people with disabilities.<br />If nationally revered and non-punitive tests such as the SAT, GRE, GMAT, and LSAT are required to provide disability testing accommodations at all of their sites, the states and their own programs have no excuse for this current arrangement. If the real focus is measuring ability, and not reinforcing a disability (including the lingering sociopolitical stigma), the same officials would not have implemented such contradictory and ill-conceived programs.<br />At one college, I was actually told by that school's disability testing office the state guidelines did not allow accommodations---despite my having qualified for them. Although this same standardized test was supposed to measure MY academic skills, the state of Texas saw nothing wrong with staffing a civil rights office with a woman openly incapable of comprehending the law---and hence job descriptions for which she was entrusted with. If state institutions themselves need education on their rights and responsibilities, who are they to presume we are arriving without our basic skills.<br />Bundled with program completion limits for all students, the many entrenched bureaucratic hurdles would make many present testing champions wake up...if they really wanted to. Standardized testing may be politically popular, but it is not moral or intelligent.have implemented such contradictory and ill-conceived programs.<br />At one college, I was actually told by that school's disability testing office the state guidelines did not allow accommodations---despite my having qualified for them.

Although neither the research area nor the format is new, the methodology and delivery method is altogether new and refreshing.<br />Whereas such collections (being the mainstays of prudent public schools who want to balance their social issues collection in an attempt to ward off the censors) would normally strike me as being overly sanitized and academically useless in the post-secondary environment, this effort epitomized a well researched and conscientious work designed to get scholars and general public alike thinking AND talking with each other. The ultimate purpose of the compilation was to truly give the readers as much information as possible instead of intentionally/unintentionally censoring their natural information thirst.<br />In addition to already standard information on reproductive rights (primary source documents from landmark court cases and secondary articles from established researchers such as Petchesky), Tome includes interesting information which will be undoubtedly bizarre to many people who had previously considered themselves relatively educated on the issues.<br />Because I had only previously heard the term `Lysol douche' in reference to illegal abortion, and knew (for example) wire coat hanger manufacturers did not encourage alternate uses of their product in open advertisement,  I was completely dumfounded to discover the Lysol company formally encouraged women to apply the substance upon their `delicate membranes' until the 1960's. I have not personally met anybody who admits to this procedure, and am not sure I would really like to either.<br />Contraceptive advertising restrictions only allowed companies to address such issues in terms of `feminine hygiene' and the company (smelling desperation and fear) exploited the climate, and American society's imminent trust in science. After all, if a `prominent' European female physician was enthusiastic about the substance herself, you knew it had to be good stuff.<br />Ironically later research by others proved the people in such copy were merely actors hawking the company's products and there was no concentration which the disinfectant was considered safe for intimate cleansing. Douching also paradoxically increased conception chances by washing the sperm into places where it could fertilize the egg and/or drastically alter the body's natural Ph balance.<br />Like the aforementioned advertisement, any perspective of reproductive history (reflecting the issue itself) is fraught with double meanings and dubious contexts.  Because it forces consciousness the American ideals of freedom and democracy have not always accepted women (and some would argue continue to do so) the historical evidence is often hotly contested---especially by those classified as anti-abortion.<br />Another distinguishing feature of Tome's volume includes the voices of those opposed to reproductive rights. Innately easier for both sides to only include those perspective with which they only agree, the inclusion is a serious step in expanding policy arguments. Still despising what they stand for, I am now able to dissect their own words and place the arguments more firmly in tandem with a specified time.<br />Conversely because even `progressive' voices are as much a product of their time as more conventional voices in an issue debate, it is dangerously absurd to presume the arguments for either side are timeless. Unlike the 19th century feminists who campaigned against abortion, medical surgery is now antiseptic in America and the infections which do arise are proactively treated with antibiotics. Were these same women alive today, they could just as easily be taking up the banner (as did Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger who originally campaigned against abortion from her experiences treating illegally-induced complications) and revering their courses.iences treating illegally-induced complications) and revering their courses.	2003-08-03

Decidedly not uncommon, activating and following this binary would be a profound injustice for both the individual reader and the larger society.<br />Since the 1973 Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade completely legalized abortion in the first three months of pregnancy, abortion has been a perpetual favorite of all political viewpoints who clamor for their representation at the state and federal levels. This same climate however means several 'current event' research compilations on state politics (as opposed to historical perspectives) run the risk of themselves appearing dangerously outdated only a few years after publication precisely because of the rapid pace of legislative history in 21st century politics. Even by the time the book has been printed, the issues (barring the truly unique circumstances) have been debated and votes cast, leaving opponents the recourse of passing counteracting legislation or attempting various legal maneuvers to reverse the policy effects.<br />Politics is supposedly about thoughtful long-term planning for the greater common good, but it's modern incarnation also includes carefully strategized moments for the benefits of potential voters---and unfortunately political action groups from all sides of the political spectrum. Because votes are the only method by which each group can truly discern whether elected officials have lived up to their position on an issue (and figure into support or opposition) it is in each official's best interest to undertake abortion votes early enough and often so those same votes can promptly become recorded for posterity as evidence.<br />Unfortunately for the casual reader not intending to do expansive research, this same dichotomy is frustrating and may ironically be one of the many factors contributing to a noted decline in general citizen satisfaction with the political process. If people are more concerned with going through the motions of public participation as opposed to actually doing it, potentially interested individuals may internalize the same process as closed and/or inherently difficult to keep up with, thereby shutting themselves out of very critical debates governing their own lives and health.<br />A set of political statistics, no matter how compelling in their own time may eventually find itself unable to contribute as fiercely to modern portraits, themselves replete with equally pressing challenges. Both scholars and lay public need not fear however because this 1995 book transitions itself nicely (however informally) into the latter category without any problems. The wealth of information contained within the collection transcends time, thereby imparting powerful lessons for today's researchers who coincidentally would otherwise have a difficult time locating the same information from multiple obscure sources and several newspapers of record.<br />Particularly of interest to this approach is the chapter on Arizona state politics and how initial party identification is not always correspondent to political ideology of the individual. In, 1992 the late arch conservative Barry Goldwater, considered the godfather of the New Right (which made attackson abortion one of its many defining hallmarks) personally opposed a state constitutional measure which would have banned most abortions.<br />Goldwater's reasoning strangely echoed that which 'liberal/radical' feminists had previously used for years (including initial campaigns for abortion rights) directly tying women's reproductive access into their larger stake within society---and gendered opposition as large-scale and systematic. It was both hypocritical and fundamentally anti-conservative to oppose international threat of intrusion into citizen's private lives via communism, and then attempt to carve out a special caveat exemptor for women and other historically subordinated communities (including GLBT Americans) precisely because they were also traditionally defined as mutually exclusive to the status quo.<br />Because America still likes to pride itself on freedom and tolerance, exposure of the dichotomy from within the proverbial ranks no less set off a storm of controversy. Mr Conservative himself ultimately did the previously unthinkable and endorsed a pro-choice Democratic female over a fellow Republican who had earnestly attempted to campaign to voters using Goldwater's previous internationally-recognized likeness without fully bothering to understand the genuine political sincerity behind these same pronouncements. Rather than talking about how conservative he was, Goldwater was able to demonstrate it to the voters by his words and actions.<br />Still vehemently disagreeing with him on the importance of the great society and other social welfare programs, I personally came away from the chapter with a greater appreciation of his own political positioning and background. Because the term 'conscience' is also freely tossed about by people of all political parties (including former Goldwater associates who abandoned conservatism in favor of promoting fascism) seeing an actual account was refreshing.<br /> Well worth it's featured acquisition price, this book is a mandate for social scientists from all perspectives. Even if it does transgress policy of spending valuable public monies on only recently published non-fiction books (to guard against inaccurate statistics) an exception should clearly be made for this title since the work featured within is not likely to be found else where.ttacks on abortion one of its many defining hallmarks) personally opposed a state constitutional measure which would have banned most abortions. <br />Goldwater's reasoning strangely echoed that which 'liberal/radical' feminists had previously used for years (including initial campaigns for abortion rights) directly tying women's reproductive access into their larger stake within society---and gendered opposition as large-scale and systematic.

The ultimate purpose of the compilation was to truly give the readers as much information as possible instead of intentionally/unintentionally censoring their natural information thirst. <br />In addition to already standard information on reproductive rights (primary source documents from landmark court cases and secondary articles from established researchers such as Petchesky), Tome includes interesting information which will be undoubtedly bizarre to many people who had previously considered themselves relatively educated on the issues. <br />Because I had only previously heard the term `Lysol douche' in reference to illegal abortion, and knew (for example) wire coat hanger manufacturers did not encourage alternate uses of their product in open advertisement,  I was completely dumfounded to discover the Lysol company formally encouraged women to apply the substance upon their `delicate membranes' until the 1960's. I have not personally met anybody who admits to this procedure, and am not sure I would really like to either. <br />Contraceptive advertising restrictions only allowed companies to address such issues in terms of `feminine hygiene' and the company (smelling desperation and fear) exploited the climate, and American society's imminent trust in science. After all, if a `prominent' European female physician was enthusiastic about the substance herself, you knew it had to be good stuff. <br />Ironically later research by others proved the people in such copy were merely actors hawking the company's products and there was no concentration which the disinfectant was considered safe for intimate cleansing. Douching also paradoxically increased conception chances by washing the sperm into places where it could fertilize the egg and/or drastically alter the body's natural Ph balance. <br />Like the aforementioned advertisement, any perspective of reproductive history (reflecting the issue itself) is fraught with double meanings and dubious contexts.  Because it forces consciousness the American ideals of freedom and democracy have not always accepted women (and some would argue continue to do so) the historical evidence is often hotly contested---especially by those classified as anti-abortion. <br />Another distinguishing feature of Tome's volume includes the voices of those opposed to reproductive rights. Innately easier for both sides to only include those perspective with which they only agree, the inclusion is a serious step in expanding policy arguments. Still despising what they stand for, I am now able to dissect their own words and place the arguments more firmly in tandem with a specified time. <br />Conversely because even `progressive' voices are as much a product of their time as more conventional voices in an issue debate, it is dangerously absurd to presume the arguments for either side are timeless. Unlike the 19th century feminists who campaigned against abortion, medical surgery is now antiseptic in America and the infections which do arise are proactively treated with antibiotics. Were these same women alive today, they could just as easily be taking up the banner (as did Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger who originally campaigned against abortion from her experiences treating illegally-induced complications) and revering their courses.	2003-08-03

Remaining underrepresented in our public schools during the supposedly enlightened 21st century, multicultural women's history promotion remains revolutionary for all ages.<br />Although Kit Kittredge and her family admittedly fare okay during the Great Depression, teaching about this same time period (and imagining it) is difficult for many readers to take in because we have directly benefited from many federal and state goverment programs explicitly designed to prevent simmilar conditions. The social programs ultimate effectivity has paradoxically left us unaware of what such conditions were really like and how people survived during these times.<br />Public school American history's tendency to gloss over the disappointing portions and head straight into World War II (however important for it's own reasons) means age-appropriate Great Depression information can be hard to come by. This sittuation disadvantages readers whose relatives are now deceased or unwilling to share their own experiences about this very same time period.<br />To her credit, author Valerie Tripp never pretends the fictional protagonist and her family experience the worst living conditions (this is made quite clear throughout both the initial story and related series)during the 1930's. Hard as the Kittredge's 'new' life is, many other friends and aquaintences experience worse living conditions. Perspective and awareness of the larger world beyond one's self are timless social skills.<br />Having been first introduced to the series when there were only three girls (Kirsten, Samantha and Molly) I can unhesitatingly say I most closely relate to Kit's independence, admiration of famous women such as Amelia Earhart, and journalistic drive.dependence, admiration of famous women such as Amelia Earhart, and journalistic drive.	2003-06-19

Initially different life perspectives lead the two girls on a timeless friendship which spans socioeconomic status.<br /><br />Samantha may be book smart, but Nellie has spent far more time in the real world's proverbial school of hard knocks.<br /><br />Nellie also helps Samantha understand why a beloved seamstress named Jessie must suddenly leave employment from her own grandmary's house. Because Samantha has grown up without wanting for anything, she does not realize other people have to prioritize the critical bread-and-butter issues such as child care, ironically to support their families. A person's staying or leaving their workplace is not always a question of whether they like the people they work for or have fun.<br /><br />While the quote on her sampler could be annoying, it also typified a sheltered Victorian childhood, and therefore did not signifigantly detract from the book's overall plot. Samantha begins to understand that surface images can be quite different from the often more complex (and dangerous) reality within the same afforementioned society.<br /><br />Yet, unlike so many of the best-intentioned reformers of the day (who really were trying to help their intended target populations), Samantha does not talk down to Nellie in this volume. We see she genuinely attempts to reach out and believe in Nellie'O Malley as an equal. Because this was ironically the social arrangement championed by idealistic first wave feminists (who envisioned an international sisterhood) the placement is inspiring.	2003-06-19

My place in the world was ultimately contingent upon my knowing and standing up for disability rights.<br />Also true to his own personality, Winkler never talks down to his audience during the adventures, instead reassuring the normalcy of wanting to fit in while being different from others in the immediate environment. The fast-paced dialog helps kids find both themselves and a voice.<br />Because no civil rights law can actually require a child to have self-esteem (or respect such boundaries of others) these books are important corollary to a still-relatively untouched subject. Narrowly constructed definitions of `smart' and `progress' continue to impede truly constructive nation-wide special education policy discussions.<br />Politicians from all across the political spectrum have rendered themselves hoarse pontificating on `academic success' and `leaving no child behind' but Winkler's efforts clearly demonstrate actual willingness providing these very tools to the audiences needing such tools the most.<br />If only this series were out when I was in public school.eams they also possessed.

Even when I was much older (and out of the intended demographic service range), I loved the truly nurturing environment regularly brough into my living room. Well before I realized my parents were not getting along (eventually divorcing), Mr. Rogers \\"told\\" me via daily broadcast that good families come in all structures, and the family format is subsequently less important than how the individual members treat eachother and themselves. When my parents finally did divorce in high school, I had been so helped by Roger's work, I immediately flashed back to his reassuring songs.<br />That the sets were decidedly showing their age in places by the late 1980's, and the cast themselves featured in some segments had died mattered much less than their overall mission of helping ALL kids navigate an often unforgiving world in uplifting and supportive tones.<br />The mostly male ensemble cast of the neighborhood (although this changed in latter seasons) was not problematic in the long-run for this feminist, because it suggested an alternate male sexuality that was built on empathy and peace as opposed to macho swaggering. It was okay for men of all ages to cry, hug and freely embrace a side of themselves that Western culture remains fixated on suppresing.<br />At a different developmental stage in the human life-span, kids were smart, and did not deserve the condescending behavior so many other adults (including those on `educational/children's' programming) spew at us in the pursuit of ratings and the almighty American dollar.<br />Unlike PBS's other \\"flagship\\" children's program, Sesame Street (now famous for abandoning the original-audience at-risk urban kids to focus on the offspring of suburban yuppies), Mr. Rogers always remembered his audience, and never sold out or let us down.<br />Even when growing partisan political battles and budget cuts provided powerful incentive to follow suit, he made sure principles were more than abstract words.  All children had an inalienable right to be treated with respect and dignity.<br />From tackling such edgy subjects as the RFK Assassination to hostages and war, Mr. Rogers always both captured and nurtured his audience's imagination. Talking things out wasn't necessarily high-tech or flashy, but it was unbelievably better when compared to letting personal feelings bottle up inside.<br />Adding to the quality, Rogers was scrupulous about not parading his religious affiliations (licensed minister in the Presbyterian Church) as the reason his advice should be taken.<br />For my generation with the unfortunate timing to grow up with the beginnings of a markedly aggressive televangelist craze, his conduct provided a welcome alternative to the less-than-admirable actions of other adults in our world. It was not enough to simply apply religious freedoms to one's self, they belong to every citizen.---including those of differing perspectives and no religious affiliation.<br />Thus, the most constructive educational pedagogy was one that did not continually promote any religion (or the formal absence) but far more civil neutrality.<br />As with so many other people, I never got to personally thank him for the gift, but I know I am using it whenever I think both critically and compassionately about the larger world around me.  I also know I am not the only one who remembers him through this type of a tribute, and our collective efforts will produce the best kind of off-screen \\"neighborhood\\" possible.<br />The not-so-subtle discounting of this very same instructional idea by self-appointed educational guardians suggests both how far ahead of his time he was and effective Rogers truly remains.<br />RIP Mr. Rogers.e best kind of off-screen \\"neighborhood\\" possible. <br />The not-so-subtle discounting of this very same instructional idea by self-appointed educational guardians suggests both how far ahead of his time he was and effective Rogers truly remains. <br />RIP Mr. Rogers.	2003-06-14

After using this book for a previous semester, I also venture public policy is an entirely accurate additional field for this work.<br />No, this work does not have the seemingly requisite tables and charts in so many more conventional public service books (of all subcategories) and the artwork interspersed throughout may throw people off who have arrived in search of intentionally more traditional academic graphic aids, but they enhance the book's overall presentation of very important (and difficult) issues.<br />Since it's inception, feminism has attempted to speak for women in general, but has instead too often inadvertently degenerated into self-promotion of relatively privileged white middle-class, heterosexual and non-disabled women who at least have one identification to attempt fallback onto when confronted with the painful reality of discrimination.<br />The majority of the world's women however do not have such protections, hence magnifying their struggles in unimaginable ways.<br />Unlike this Bridge Called my Back (1981) and other 'second wave' classics which inadvertently focused on American based women, this anthology also takes the further step of examining such communities outside of the United States and Western Europe.<br />Evidenced by the 1995 Fifth International UN women's conference in Beijing, real and permanent women's liberation only occurs when intended programs and laws are culturally sensitive and appropriate models as opposed to the 'one-size must fit all' models previously (and some would argue currently proposed) by other western feminists.<br />Specifically, Isabelle R. Gunning (pp. 203-224) argues Female Genital Mutilation is not simply a pattern of male-on-female violence designed to torture women for the fun of it, but often a procedure that other women and girls (despite the inevitable risks and complications) encourage each other to undergo for fear of isolation and stigmatization. Consequently, the best alternatives to eradicating these same procedures would both explain the health risks experienced by women are directly connected to FGM and search for alternative ceremonies that could be performed instead as a way of symbolizing those same women's transition into adulthood and imparting values of respect and monogamy (this time, explicitly for both genders).<br />Also intriguing (given the U.S.'s recent history of involvement in the region) is Mervat F. Hatem's (pp. 369-390) Middle Eastern feminism essay. Theoretically, both the increased racial consciousness of journalists (many of whom cut their proverbial teeth in the tumultuous sixties covering the emergent civil rights movement) and a general (if grudging recognition) of sexism prevents the occurrences, but 'liberal' westerners continue to freely engage in the binary portrayal of the Middle East as a totally backwards land for women, also conveniently overlooking the current U.S. Government's (when opposition was then spearheaded in 1998 by socially conservative Congressional Republicans) well-publicized internal hostility toward's women's expanded public sphere role via curtailment of reproductive and other previously won civil rights.<br />It's easy to point fingers at and condemn other nations for their actions when entire societies are conveniently unwilling to retrack and confess to their own deeply ingrained biases. Clashing deeply with still-publicly voiced ideals of 'democracy' and 'fairness' policy reality is difficult for America to collectively undergo itself.<br />Having read other 'multicultural feminist' anthologies prior to this course, I naively (and very incorrectly assumed the format would be effective, but totally interchangeable with what I already knew.<br />Because this was clearly not the case, I heartily encourage anybody interested in feminist public policymaking to get and HEAVILY read through this volume.

Alternately, the authors balance this view with pragmatic political approaches that equip the reader with introductory strategies to hold off or even staunch further erosion of American social policy.<br />The book by itself is enjoyable, but advanced classes should use the American Welfare State as a supplementary text for historical background.	2003-05-25

Instead of being demonized or trivalized, women's political activity organizing on behalf of their own rights is something all women (regardless of age) should become involved in.<br />Even until the late 1990's, the numbers of American women participating in politics as office holders themselves remained pittably small compared to the percentage of potential elgible officeholders. Reccenty however, the question has shifted from if the United States will have a woman president to when and who that canidate will be.<br />The book is also notable because it suggests the inevitability of one time opponents eventually embracing feminism themselves as a result of respectful dialouge between both sides. This title technically is a children's book, but the lesson from the encounter between Samantha's beloved Grandmary (who has long expressed sentiments hostile to many progressive reforms) and Cornelia (herself ironically responsible for those same reforms) indicates women of initially different politics can work together and find common ground, if only they listen to eachother's concern's and needs.<br />I was however bothered the book did not mention women of color this increased climate of mutuality and respect.

Coincidentally, fetal life had never been among the concerns of the original legislators.<br />Doctors could attempt to treat illegal abortion complications, but paradoxically could not offer women services which would prevent the horrific medical crises to begin with.<br />Consequently, a patchwork of reform laws began developing under the recommendation of the American Law Institute, the Clergy Consultation Services, and fair minded legislators who were navigating realization the laws had to be reformed, with uncertainty of how far those reforms should go. Unlike the women's liberationists of the later 1960's who framed abortion as a woman's right and conversely positioned denial as a tool of women's subordination, the professionals involved in these cases also reasoned their control of the process would remove the social stigma then attached to abortion. If women could be screened prior to undergoing an abortion, only virtuous women would receive the procedure and society would be preserved.<br />However easy to disparage their intentions from the vantage point of a self-identified 'third wave' feminist who has never known a world without legalized abortion, I recognize their involvement in the policy process as a critical step in obtaining an eventual nationwide repeal ruling.<br />As the futility of conservative reform statues and widely varying laws became apparent, newly minted reproductive rights activists became less willing to accept anything less than a standardized national repeal.<br />With the Bush administration openly vowing to turn back the clock on women's rights (and the obvious willingness of some state legislatures in helping to achieve that goal) case studies such as these will prove to be an indispensable resource for scholars and activists alike.

Although commonly exhibited by the right (who blanch at any hint of sexuality or multiculturalism) the left is also guilty of this activity.<br />Because it would be easier to lay the blame sqaurely with one political ideology, the book is a policy milestone. Instead of balancing student's perspectives and preparing them to become better informed about the world they are prepared to inherit, the colaborative censorship has dumbed down our textbooks to the point where they do not impart much.<br />Long term impacts also leave students in college prep programs unprepared for these environments where they wil have to come into regular contact with new theories and 'controversial' information challenging the perception of America as a wise and benevolent nation. It is thus a disservice to encourage students  to view their world as benign and safe.	2003-05-23

Additionally, different groups of students are educationally tracked (advanced placement, special education) but this system and it's real effects on the individual student are too convienently downplayed during test administration time.<br />The tests real function is to ultimately provide quickie reassurance to elected officials and parents alike that their communities are 'smart' while continuing to avoid and/or underaddress the curricular and economic issues which would actually enable these students to succed on the same programs.	2003-05-22

While the book claimed to be national in scope and made some efforts to include diversity (minority and GLBT enrollment) the author ommitted non-flagship universities.<br />Recognizing there were time and space issues involved in the publication decision, the ommission also forgot other college guides have no problem finding and locating the smaller institutions. Ever increasing financial costs and college prep standards means these traditionally 'second-tier' institutions are growing in popularity, and Birnberg does her audience a great diservice by remaining so narrowly focused.<br />In today's world, the increasing internet availability (whether in a private home, or public library) means people can research colleges for themselves and not have to waste valuable time attempting to learn if there is a college who will assess their academic record, instead of total number of honors classes.	2003-05-22

Their public actions apparently contradicted their own proclaimations women stay home and leave the politcs, but were blunted by apparently convincing statistics then somewhat reflecting a segment of the American public.<br />Furthermore, because pre-existing job segregation and gender role conditioning paralleled the presentation, the afforementioned set could somewhat explain her objections to modern feminism, in a way today's offering clearly falls short. Although Schlafly and I fall on opposite ends of the political spectrum, and I had honestly not expected much after surveying her previous work, I was shocked a major publisher produced a work whose editing process fails college grammar standards.<br />Since the 1970's, American society has undoubtedly changed in many demographic perspectives, but Schafly remains caught in some weird paradigm which believes utilizing 30 year old statistics makes for ethical research.<br />The self-described authority of anti-feminism forgets the principle rule of credible debate requires serious presentation of supporting facts. No matter who you are, people are not going to listen to a speaker without the requsite data and supporting awareness of social shifts.<br />Because American terrain itself has shifted so drastically since the 1970's (especially for racial/ethnic groups, people with disabilities, and other previously subordinated groups) the economic structure she champions is no longer workable for every single family. A two parent income is a reality for some families in the abscence of liveable market wages, adequate enforcement of non-discrimination laws, and consistent opportunity AND ability to utilize the latest medical technology.<br />Resorting to binary creation of 'good' vs. 'anti-family' women unwittingly sells her own arguments further short because the real world (and daily existence within) is not an either/or binary. Most people fit comfortably in several niches, depending on their own needs and the specific political issue put forth to address that afformentioned sittuation.<br />Ideally, everybody lives a comfortable life, but individuals of all political ideologies who have been paying attention to newsreports understands that stratification abounds, and the socioeconomic discrepancy is even widening.<br />That a Catholic such as Schafly (whose religion openly prescribes a consistent life ethic and greater attention to social welfare needs as a way of reducing abortion) continues to engage in such naive and convinent presentations is disappointing, but not at all shocking.<br />Since her earliest campaigns supporting presidential candidiate Barry Goldwater (who coincidentally WAS later able to understand the importance of credible research and keeping BOTH one's argument and mind updated) Schlafly has specialized in distortion and self-projection.<br />The still red-scare tinged enviroment of the 1960's (and to a lesser extent the 1970's) might have permitted a certain degree of flamboyance and personal liberty in report preparation, but the Cold War is largely over and today's political climate expects grownups to substantiate their own research claims.<br />While there are still no shortage of anti-feminists in American society, Schafly ironically makes the best case against her own continued participation within American politics. Unable and unwilling to deal with modern society, now she has reached the point of even being unable to work with contemporary anti-feminists such as Christine Stolba and Wendy McElroy who recognize social statistical portraits have shifted.<br />Indeed, myself and other feminists no longer have to work against Schlafly's organizing efforts when she has apparently appropriated that task for herself.n unwittingly sells her own arguments further short because the real world (and daily existence within) is not an either/or binary.

An author can have the best presentation in the world, but it will not acheive it's transformative potential if shunted to a relatively contained collegiate academic community, who would already be predisposed to read such works anyway.<br />The color charts also help hardened political scientists such as myself who are already familiar with the information, but have difficulty remembering through more traditionally dry presentations. The pages are ideal 'flashcards' when used in supplement with the afformentioned standardized global feminist treatments.<br />Finally, since they continue to underteach women's history and present in the 21st century, this would be an ideal gift for the public school systems. The presentation and arrangement of the book information is likely to win points with department chairs and librarians who would otherwise be skeptical about the appropriatness for their community. Consequently, a student in search of statistical information on women may subsequently emerge from their project research with a broadened political spectrum and genuine commitment to social justice.<br />The only readily apparent flaw is the already outdated publication date. An ever-changing global environment means the information reflected in this book may not be wholly up-to-date, even though women's collective global status remains basically unchanged.	2003-05-18

Because many of today's news anchors came of age during Vietnam themselves (and learned the administration response is not always truthful) the ommission is all the more upsetting.<br /><br />I also realized however well-intentioned my politics, they would be difficult to communicate in a soundbite driven economy where even the most initally open-minded of swing voters becomes quickly ailenated by lengthy political tomes. Thus, even if a majority of citizens actually doubted the administration, their ability to provide memorable soundbies quickly reassured the same audiences. This book is an excellent tool for beating the far right at it's own game.<br /><br />The updated images are intentionally culled from 1940's-1950's propaganda posters, ironically a time when patriotism was also blindly practiced. In those days, the fastest way to defeat your opponent was to accuse them of un-American behavior, a frightening trend returning in our own era. Government abuse of constitutional rights is allowed as long as good citizens remain silent and do nothing.<br /><br />Wright has cleverly rengineered some entries to directly appeal to the  self-humor of anti-war protestor's. Social change by nature is hard and prolonged, but taking a little time out to engage in sardonic humor at one's self helps lighten the long journey ahead.<br /><br />Although there are dozens of national and local anti-war organizations, this book would be especially helpful for groups (new ones, and/or students) who want to protest 21st century colonization without blowing their own budgets. The professionally edited images arrive ready for modifications (an explicit suggestion within the book) thereby helping to ensure American democracy is more than a slogan, and something we actually practice ourselves.nature is hard and prolonged, but taking a little time out to engage in sardonic humor at one's self helps lighten the long journey ahead.

Having read this book for my feminist theories class, I was shocked at the celebrity afterward from Angela Davis, which admitted she hadn't initially thought our generation of feminist theorists was important enough to read for their own sakes.<br />Because Davis had once pointedly lectured both the women's movement and mainstream society about the dangers of making presumptions (and subsequently allowing those preconcieved notions to guide your own politics) I had hoped she (more than any other second waver name-dropped in this project) would also be aware of the dangers from ageism.<br />My heart consequently fell as I realizes she was never actually interested in 'bridging' or mentoring with my generation of feminist activist/theorists, but simply touting her own horn about how great she was, and how by implication we would somehow never be able to match up. Ironically, the multipronged social justice strategies she freely champions in other settings become impossible with her own condescending view of 'feminist activism' since a single generation of activists will not live forever, and younger ones might provide critical insights for victory (that is assuming they were allowed to speak in meaningful ways, and were listened to).<br />No, Davis might not like everything in exactly the format that is said by the newer theorists, but then the proverbial million dollar question begs: Why lend your name and words to something you don't particularly care for at all anyways?<br />Editor Walker (daughter of Alice Walker) bears some responsibilty for this literary mess since she seems to have culled 'famous feminists' from her mother's rolodex without pondering if they would actually treat herself or the audience as whole people, instead of annoying interlopers who are threatining 'other's' feminist movement.<br />Such, a shame too because this book really could have been a huge breakthrough with the correct editing.	2003-05-15

Irrespective of the reader's own personal politics, the highly charged political nature of GLBT rights means finding 'balanced' academic works is incredibly difficult. Most titles either soley focus on the glbt OR far right without attempting some sort of journalistic mediary between the two.<br />As a diehard liberal, my politics personally go with the former group, but my need for balance in classroom assigments (which included a mock curricula)left me in a quandry. How would I teach about a social group I inately despised (the religious right) while giving my potential students the required information they would need to discern a broader picture?<br />Looking through the right's own books seemed boring and actual field interviews also seemed dangerous because of the unknown communication problems I was potentially setting myself up for in the arrangement (people spamming me with information after the fact, attempting to change my own politics and/or harrassing me).<br />Thus, I was personally relieved to make Mr. Bull's concise book an addition to my library. The 1990's were both a time of great political gains and setbacks for the GLBT community, and understanding past policy battles in Oregon and Colorado (among other profiles) helps today's activists prepare counter-response to simmilar campaigns in their own muncipaties.<br />Also helpful is the book's immediate practicality to intended communities. Even if I can decipher advanced queer political theory with my previously aquired political training, such barriers could inadvertently reduce the numbers of movement allies when the need is most critical. Bull's plainspeak language is intentionally utilized to neither speak over or down to his readers, they instantly know they CAN be part of the solution to every identified policy problem.	2003-05-14

Consequently, patrotism has become twisted to suggest support and compliance with the policy goals.<br />The equally famous daughter of the 35th president, Kennedy has ample ground to make a political platform within this book. To her credit, she does not, instead reaching beyond the core group of people sharing her own political ideologies, in a time when this principle is all but forgotten by all political players. Whether you fully agree with a fellow American, you can learn from their ideas (and vice versa) if only willing to open your heart and mind.<br />The reprint nature of the material within this book means people do not neccesarily learn Ms. Kennedy's own policy positions (although she may eventually run for office herself) but we are also spared the cloyingly simplistic view of flawless leaders too often bundled into political inspiration books, especially in these trying times.<br />For a generation that has too often heard the word 'patriot' used as a divisive political tool to root out difference, this book was a refreshing antidote.	2003-05-12

I had not edited the story, but was expected to take the heat for another person's restructuring without hesitation.<br /><br />Arriving on top of Texas state agency budget cuts (for which on-campus jobs are hard to now find) the firing completely shattered my world. What had seemed like a pastime for my obviously now former friend had been my financial sustenance. Student teachers who were still receiving money from home could not possibly comprehend the importance of a good paying campus job.<br /><br />Reading this book helped me realize there was nothing I could have done to prevent her behavior. Her complaining about the story not being exactly as she wanted was technically nothing personal directed at myself. I was only the person in immediate vicinity at the time.  Her actions were selfish because they had not considered what consequences I would have to deal with.<br /><br />It is not always easy to detect a potentially 'bad friendship' and they may be concealed beneath an initially functional exterior. We had worked together for many semesters previously without her making such allegations against me or another person.  If it wasn't me, this person would have destroyed another acquaintance's life without similar guilt.<br /><br />It is best to move on and find people who truly value you for being yourself.	2003-05-03

Thankfully, I also saw through the hypocritical ineptitude that is Mr. Nader.<br />Once a widely-respected consumer advocate who was hailed by Gloria Steinem 'because he seemed interested in people regardless of their sex' Nader himself proved he had been taking lessons at the 'New left' school of gender relations because he seemed oblivious that feminism and GLBT equality were active social movements in later 20th Century America. The left was curriously limited to straight men who theoretically had the least to loose irrespective of who became president.<br />Chiding the 'conservative' Gore campaign for their social issues stance, Nader then claimed he did not want to talk about reproductive rights and GLBT equality because they were only 'gonadal' politics and therefore were somehow not as serious as real 'diversity' measures he would undertake if only given a chance.<br />Thus, it is little wonder that despite Gore's own mixed voting reccord as a House of Representatives member and Senator, people concerned about Bush's inevitable attack on these very issues would continue to vote for the Democratic party. We knew the 2000 elections were a very dangerous time to suddenly become naive about the essential nature of Washington DC power politics, and our own vunerability.<br />Condescending to potential constituent groups is the worst way to get them to change their voting patterns, because any lefty worth their cause also now expects the 'traditional' white male candidates to be well-versed in their community issues. Claiming batchlerhood negates discussion time (as Nader actually did on the campaign trail) is just as innappropriate as a white candidate attempting to distance themselves from African American rights by virtue of ethnic/racial differences...and just as reactionary as they come.<br />I do not believe Nader cost Gore the election, or the country it's freedom. That doozy comes courtesy of the United States Supreme Court. What Nader did was cost himself and the American Green Party valuable public credbility when the European Greens understood sexism and homophobia were serious forms of oppression and not something to take lightly. Ironically (for better or worse) it also reinforced pre-established voting patterns favoring the democrats because at least they understood we had a vote and would give it to any candidate who recognized our issues.<br />My 1980's admiration of Nader has long evaporated the way of Mall Bangs and New Kids on the Block.st Gore the election, or the country it's freedom.

During my undergraduate education, I was honored to attend her lecture on women's history struggles.<br /><br />Thus, imagine my surprise upon seeing this book would be used for a graduate Women's Studies class, much less, in conjunction with an academic's name. I simply could not believe this was the same person from whom I had heard an authoritative, professionally delivered lecture.<br /><br />Both in length, layout, and depth, the work easily resembles junior high school offerings. That a PhD could produce such harried work in 2001, and pass it off as excellent scholarship is a sad testament to remaining difficulties 'enlightened' white feminists have attempting to study 'other' women.<br /><br />Claiming to \\"celebrate diversity\\", her heavily edited history just happens to present sanitized multicultural interactions as the idealized norm.<br /><br />Nowhere in the book does it mention the complicity the aforementioned women (or other white feminists--including those who admired the power structures) exhibited in the eventual destruction of tribal culture and people.<br /><br />However inspired early feminists may have been by Haudenosaunee society, this inspiration clearly had limits, as the American women's movement demonstrated susceptibility to racist and ethnocentric ideologies. Roesch Wagner's failure providing critical examination of 'first wave' feminists ulterior motives undercuts what could have been a very interesting read.<br /><br />No, Stanton's later comments (omitted from this book for whatever reason) disparaging men of color for receiving suffrage while white women lacked the ballot are not 'nice', 'progressive', or 'enlightened' but they do show history as it actually happened, and would paradoxically provide a 'road map' for today's feminists so we can self-identify and stop making the same old mistakes.<br /><br />Just because it is a project involving 'women of color' does not excuse Roesch Wagner from meticulous research. Ironically, it demands far more because of exclusionary traditions that made histories about women of color the least known.<br /><br />Failing to show history in its full complexity is grossly irresponsible. As a professional whose work has built on publicizing the lives of traditionally subordinated (and silenced) groups, Roesch Wagner owes society an enormous apology.<br /><br />While she claims the book was produced with full tribal cooperation, I highly doubt it.men of color' does not excuse Roesch Wagner from meticulous research.

Although our mother did not work outside the home for paid employment, we needed to realize other mothers did---and their families were no worse off than ours simply because of that fact.<br />The powerful prose made this book a childhood favorite of mine, and I often wondered what had happened to the book. Surely my brother and I could not have been the only people to have read this tittle? Sadly out of print, I strongly encourage anybody who finds a copy of this book to get it for the kids in your life.<br />The story centers on a family's readjustment as the mother reenters the workforce following a homemaking period. Because the two children have been so used to mom handling all matters domestic, seeing dad pitch in (and expectation of their own help) is initially shocking, but the family becomes a stronger unit from the new learning experience.<br />Unclear what the authors own personal politics are (invitations to join feminist organizations are NOT interspersed throughout the book) the storyline convincingly argues flexible gender roles benefit fathers allowing more bonding time with their children. Yes, Dad does get frustrated when disobeyed during chore time, but turns out to be a really cool person who makes awesome pancakes and otherwise knows how to entertain the kids (which, for some odd reason was not revealed before mom's new job).<br /><br />Today's self-evident lesson in family love and diversity was quite radical in 1977 when the baby boom generation, themselves having been raised on infamously rigid gender roles was just starting to have kids of their own, and early generation gen-xers were growing up alongside the feminist and divorce revolutions as they shaped the way a nation thought about marriage, the family, communication, and roles	2003-01-21

It's a tired arguement that bears more than a chilling semblance to those used by Johnson's Vietnam team (themselves formely the heads of major American multinational corporations) in assuring the president of an easy victory. History of course, reveals a far different picture.<br />Indeed, an administration whose foregin policy immediately following 9/11 was focused on finding Osama Bin Laden \\"mysteriously\\" shifted to the 'immediate' threat Iraq posed even as the country's surrounding neighbors (who would theoretically have much peace of mind in a world without Saddam) are urging us not to follow through on our narrow minded fanatical zeal.<br />Great Britan, once a lukewarm ally is even rethinking it's mild support with the realization evidence has not been produced to warrant UN action. If the two countries acted against Iraq, they would become the very rouge states they supposedly are opposing.<br />Although Bush's handlers and spin doctors are undoubtedly trying to paint opposition to war against Iraq as the timless liberal versus conservatives debate, the fact that Republican-identified individuals such as this author, members of Congress, and the everyday citizens the president supposedly claims to care about are all asking tough questions clearly demonstrates good people of concience are refusing to play the global bully.	2003-01-09

While disclosing previously unreleased information on Revolutionary America, the depth and complexity of the New Deal----unarguably American government's most revolutionary and profound social policy involvement in any century, is not given it's proportional treatment.<br />Granted, the premise of his particular book is not exactly a regular part of discussion in most social science courses (including 'liberal' college offerings) neccesitating a start at the begining, but I was left wanting much more.<br />Recognizing the provision of social services has been and will continue to be an inherently politcal concept, something in Jansson's style of writing sounds guarded, as if he is not willing to share all with the reading audience. Considering the critical nature of the subject mater being presented, this is a disappointment because a more substantial and pointed work could accomplish more.<br />America's ambivalent social welfare record makes the history depressing, but we need to understand where we have been in order to accurately chart where the country needs to go. That 1996's intensely punnitative welfare reform legislation was eagerly embraced by leading officials from all parties was only the most reccent mainifestation of the afforementioned love/hate duality.<br />Aid to Families with Dependent Children itself was ironically developed in the 1930's so widowed or single white women COULD stay at home with their children like all 'good' women of the day. Uncoincidentally, politicians began their assault on the program around the time of racial intergration even as enrollment remained predominantely white, the biggest federal expenditures were the armed forces and 'welfare mothers' as a whole were just as hardworking as the general population. Because payments never kept up with cost of living adjustments since the 1960's, the women by very definition had to be hard working in order to survive.<br />This book can be used in a course, but only in conjunction with a work such as Dinitto, emphasizing the inherently political activist underpinings and responsibilities of social policy.on the program around the time of racial intergration even as enrollment remained predominantely white, the biggest federal expenditures were the armed forces and 'welfare mothers' as a whole were just as hardworking as the general population.

This empathy remains tempered by realization their unchecked version of 'good' public policy is a world nobody should live in.	2003-01-05

This would be because the imigration policies she oddly prefers had been notoriously biased towards white anglo protestants for much of American imigration history.<br /><br />Considered 'second class', non-whites were regularly denied entrance no matter how pro-American, law-abiding, or hard working they individually were. Rampant anti-Asian sentiment set rigid quotas which made entry all but impossible.<br /><br />Naturally, Malkin's family is supposed to represent the lone exception to the endless list of perceived imigrant-initiated flaws, for how else would she become a pawn of the far right if they were still in the Phillipines?<br /><br />Make no mistake the conservative commentators eagerly promoting this book only accept her into their sanctums because Malkin sold herself to people who only like her if she can be their 'attack dog' or 'window dressing' for whatever arcane policy enacted next in a futile attempt to revive the 18th century.<br /><br />Otherwise they'd be happy to have her working as a house maid!	2003-01-04

Also helpful is the concious decision to focus on events in the entire country, as opposed to only the East and West Coasts.<br />The only problem I had with the book was the selective ommission of interviews towards the present day. In 1993, Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain vocally expressed his support for GLBT freedom/opposition to Oregon's homophobic  Ballot Measure 9 (among other progressive views) in a cover-story/interview, but nothing was mentioned about his influence on our generation in a time when the right was flush with zeal attempting these strategies, themselves trying to influence the youth vote.	2002-12-10

I read this book for an undergraduate public policy class, and found there are a lot more of us in Texas than even I had particularly realized.<br />Not usually one for case studies (I've seen too many instances where they are used simply to avoid direct discussion of an issue) Wilson takes great pains to select his entries, clearly demonstrating these movements are important because they show how citizens can move goverments, especially those as historically staid as Texas.<br />Designed under the guise of limiting governmental interference in citizen's daily lives, the part time, twice a year legislature  places us at a distinct disadvantage compared to other states. In an era of rapidly normalizing economic and other problems, this form of goverment may prove ultimately inadequate for dealing with 21st century policy realities.<br />At the same time, he is careful to accord praise on those parts of the current system which do work--certainly including citizen and community participation. Even better, his concept of real citizen participation travels well beyond the rehearsed and sanitized (where goverment only cares if citizen wishes coincidentally match what it intends to do anyways) to champion real empowerment and change.<br />Even if the process is long and hard (which the studies assure us, it will be) nothing compares to at least going out and attempting to try and change a sittuation for the good of all people. You will come away from this 'textbook' completely mesmerized and invigorated, ready to take on the world yourself.	2002-12-01

Yes, working in the public sector often entails being called on to do more with less resources than private corporations of any size, but this is all part of the job. Also required is taking the oath of office and non-partisan requirements very seriously. Those who find the task too challenging are not the best person for the job.<br />If I had even done half the things her office thought were okay in the book, I would be facing very stiff punnishment--and questions about my own competency.

Only, then will all societies be able to move forward in pursuit of the oft-mythologized 'perfect world'. That the book (and author in some circles) is attacked for being 'spacey' or rambling says more about the reader's own internalized fear of 'difference' because this book was so inspiring.<br />Working in progressive movements, I know coalition building is critical to my policy objectives, but the prose helped me understand how emotionally positive the process was. Most 'conventional' public administration textbooks do a wonderful job talking about technology and finances, but rarely factor in the human dimension so profoundly as she does.<br />Anzaldua may wish to include translations from Spanish in future editions of the book because this would help residents of many other \\"borderlands\\" comprehend her own experiences and perspectives more easily than currently possible.	2002-11-30

Critics were both eager to claim the music as 'cutting edge' while derriding the very people who made it possible, particularly the petite frontman.<br />This book clarifies society itself and not the man contributed the most to the morose imagery. Inside this book we learn of a young man who tried in vain to keep a sense of self and humor in a world that did not always make sense. Sure, mainstream music loves to pitch audiences endless 'hard-luck' tales of their current favirotes, but actually reading real experiences is conciousness raising.<br />Born into a working class Washington state neighborhood, Cobain toiled around in various families and odd jobs before forming the band which would permanently change his life forever--Nirvana. The band played small venues in virtual obscurity until the release of 1991's suprise (especially to Cobain who was unprepared for the mass stardom) Nevermind, permanently altering the face of rock.<br />Nirvana were never overtly political in the sense of the past's Dead Kennedy's or today's Le Tigre, but Kurt's penchant for talking 'about things that piss me off' indicate an individual with a very deep sense of compassion for others that may as well have been rooted in the 1960's. Avoiding such 'mainstreamed' causes as AIDS awareness and the environment, he includes a healthy amount of information on gender and women's issues along side the above mentioned standard comments. Yet, this was not a stunt as Cobain actually believed enough in his own oppinons to warn racists, sexists and homophobes to REFRAIN from giving money to the Nirvana media empire, against all conventional perspectives.<br />As the handwriten, litteral translations also revealed, Cobain was hardly perfect, but this humaness provided the consolation that so many of my generation were seeking in a time when numerous other sources told us we did not understand or did not matter. Indeed, Cobain's legacy is that one person can have a profound impact on the collective psyche of a generation.y of my generation were seeking in a time when numerous other sources told us we did not understand or did not matter.

Abortion was now dangerous because it increased women's autonomy and freedom.<br />While May does address reproductive policy, this work suprisingly does not delve heavily into how anti-communism and reproductive bias paralleled eachother.Considering many post-war restrictions (pregnancy-related job firing and school expulsion co-existed with illegality of abortion and contraception) were directly related to women's reproductive potential, a considerable amount of research was missing from her book. The research presented skimmed what I had already discovered from Solinger et al's other works and did not provide the insight I was desperatley seeking.<br />Because May is able to tie anti-communist objectives into television and other cultural arenas, I remain puzzled by the selective exclusion. However well written structurally, it also seemed as if she were skipping around the same argument, but electing not to explore it for whatever reason.<br />This book is not a good candidate for work with reproductive policy, but would be an excellent choice for a general study of American women's post-war political agency.	2002-11-19

At times, I actually saw myself in the two dimensions, going through their same actions.<br />Dana, a 'modern' 20th century black woman meets her 18th century ancestor, a white southerner named Rufus as a result of unexplained flashbacks she has. At one point, her fiancee is drug into the past with her, but the role is inconsequential to Dana's own self-journey and discovery.<br />Although Butler makes pains throughout the novel to dash Gone with the Wind for it's undeniabily romantic view of slavery and the accompanying racial subordination, she seems to engage in a little bit of this herself throughout the novel. Even if he is technically family, Dana appears to idolize Rufus a little too much throughout the texts, giving readers an impression his behavior is just a little more excusable than other whites on the plantation.<br />Certainly as her ancestor, Dana has interest in seeing Rufus live long enough to create the family tree that will eventually create her, but this necesity also gave way to a sentimental feeling that apparently tried to ignore the power discrepancies between their two characters in favor of a 'safe' story. Even with time shifts and quick aging, Rufus's willingness to attempt anti-racist work is a little too convient for the book's plot.	2002-11-15

Not until working on a graduate level independent study did I realize how easily the mass media had distorted and hidden a facinating history of feminism and progressivism--at a time supposedly anthetical to both.<br />Without diminishing the hardships that did exist (restrictions on abortion, contraceptives, pregnancy discrimination, racial discrimination, homophobic bar raids) she shows how these groups responsed with ingenuity and independence. As an added plus, the book confirms dissent was much larger than the mass media or public officials cared to actually admit back to the general public. This false reassurance temporarily fit into the cold-war's emphasis on bland conformity, but it silenced many people's experiences until now.<br />Progressive actions must have been impossible in the era of McCarthyism's suppression of political and cultural dissent, but perseverance made the women's victories all the more rewarding. Furthermore, many of the same women profiled in Meyerowitz's book used the time to lay critical groundwork essential for the 'revolutionary' 1960's and 1970's. Feminism did not simply reconstitute itself after an 'abscence' following suffrage victory, but was marginalized by an unspoken arrangement between the media and politics.<br />Buy two copies of this book.

Yet, the immediate post-war era saw massive restriction on the number of 'legal' abortions which directly contradicted medical technology's advancement. Paradoxically, when the procedure had attained a fair degree of safety, society was going to go out of it's way to remove women from their own reproductive rights. <br />This removal had significantly less to do with fetal rights than concern about the woman's real and future 'femininiy'. An informal and unlikely coalition of government experts, and Madison avenue set out to convince the American woman (via comericials, movies, and atrocious sitcoms) THE way to fight the communists was through their unquestioning adoption and adherence to a pre-determined gender role, because only then could she (and the nation) be 'sure' her children would grow up unmarred by communist doctorine.  <br />While there is some information implicating newly rigid gender roles (and the related quest to contain women's sexuality--just like the containment for the communists!)in the sharp increase in abortion prosecutions and legal/cultral restrictions, it did not go in depth as much as I would have prefered. For whatever reason imaginable, May's research into this specific facet abruptly fades in and out of an otherwise solid and engrossing text.	2002-11-13

Because the journey to such freedom is inherently difficult and long, separatism is not a practical option for many of the contributors.<br />Indeed, separatism's short-term benefits of self-affirmation quickly finds itself limited through the reality people can/do have more than one subordinating characteristic and the interconnectedness of society at large. Each contributor's respective identities provide shielding and stress to varying degrees---the task is to work towards the day when all of them accept an individual as a whole.<br />To this extent, the contributors and authors also place a premium on personal care and rejuvenation. What seems like a misplaced concept in a much politicized text is a key piece of advice from seasoned activists. Recognizing and admitting the interconnectedness and pervasive nature of discrimination is critical, but it is impossible for any one person to save the world alone (let alone overnight) and nor should anybody feel pressured to do so.<br />Because the original book's contributors have become 'old friends' to many readers seeing themselves reflected in the pages, the editors were insistent upon including the voices of original contributors. Most interesting is Max Wolf Valerio (previously credited as Anita Valerio) who discovered his real identity as a man and underwent the requisite changes to allow external features to match internal identity. Valerio also found comfort in indigenous Indian cultures which have a more fluid concept of gender than the dominant Anglo society.<br />Also different is the noticeably increased percentage of academic works, as opposed to the more personal slant of the initial book.

The combined impact of race/ethnicity, sex and ecconomic status govern black women's relation to their own bodies--and treatment from policymakers and medical personnel.<br />While this premise has been previously examined by other scholars, Robert's contribution differs in legal analysis of the state/women relationship specifically as it applies to black women. She also faults fellow feminists for their ignorance, silence, and apathy towards black women's unique reproductive rights.<br />Begining with a critique of the predominantley white pro-choice movement for preoccupation with white middle class women and the assumption reproductive access means the same thing for all groups, Roberts holds black women's fertility is only valued if a predominantley white society can find ways to benefit from it.<br />She also notes that illegal abortion took the highest tolls on low-income black women who were unlikely to have the financial and political clout of rich white women to convince doctors to perform theraputic abortions in secret. At the same time, abortion should not be the sole issue of a truly progressive reproductive rights movement because coercive sterilization and contraceptive programs are also painful incidents in black women's reproductive history.<br />The pro-choice movement should oppose reccent 'welfare reform victories' because of the destruction such punitative measures have on black communities.

African Americans were only allowed a public acceptance if they conformed to stereotypical images produced by the larger (predominantely white) society.<br /><br />Kern-Foxworth's tome provides an eloquent examination of this double bind through brand origins to their modern day counterparts. Early depictions of Aunt Jemima reveal a gross caricturization of Black women's physical features and alleged mannerisms that can never be mistaken for flattery, yet this image was welcomed into many facilities where a living African American irrespective of title would never had been welcome.<br />Critics of this meticulously researched, spell-binding work could argue the presence of African Americans featured on foodstuffs could be a paean to black visibility via capitalism (where purchasing popularity becomes linked to empowerment/) but the argument would conveniently neglect the undeniably problematic implications of linking African American service and purchase.<br />Not even a transformation from turbaned servant to the vague \\"modern woman\\" has completely resolved very serious cultural contradictions and dilemmas surrounding Aunt Jemima. Is she a tool of the dominant society, a covert agent for revolutionary change or somewhere in between? Through art deconstructing and explore cultural politics, she is positioned as an uneasy reminder of America's less than admirable history of discrimination and bigotry.<br />Reading this book is tough, but critical for everybody interested in political change and pop culture. Advertising imagery is not inanimate, instead both reflecting and shaping the nation. Encouraging critically thought about the political undertones of pop culture, the author by extension makes profound contributions to civil rights public policy.	2002-08-10

Under the auspices of relief work, the two went in to convert others to their own religion and thus, should have not been shocked by their subsequent treatment. It's easy to display religious zeal until it is yourself that is the victim of such treatment.<br />Still, even at it's worst, the text could help prevent future youth from making the same cultural blunders. If a trip to a different country is planned, at least have the common deccency and courtesy to fammilarize yourself with the culture before arrival. It also serves as a badly needed reminder why preservation of Church-State separation ultimately benefits all people.	2002-07-27

In this work, she suggests herself and other feminists have failed to permanently secure public policy victories previously gained because of replacement of \\"rights\\" with choice in the name of political expidiency.<br />Within the context of \\"choice\\" freedom is merited out to those groups of women that meet the dominant society's preferences. Race and ecconomic status have been used by politicians and political pundits to divide women from eachother---and most importantly, from being recognized as full citizens under the law.<br />The book's interweaving of abortion access, adequate welfare provisions, and ethical adoption is admirable, but it stands to be overshaddowed by critical ommissions and simplifications.<br />Identifying herself as a pro-choice woman of the baby boom generation, Solinger then audaciously claims the \\"Back Alley Butcher\\" was a PR creation, since conditions without legal abortion were never as bad as fellow feminists had suggested. Charging the phrase was rooted in political expediency, she somehow overlooks that a nation allowing women to be slaughtered and maimed wholesale in lieu of competent medical care can be easily seen to wage war on the very right of women to be treated as human beings and citizens.<br />This text gives the impression Solinger did not actually bother to test her political theory (adopted for whatever reason) against the gargantuan presence of illegal-abortion related injury and fatality statistics. Even though she has repeatedly reminded the reader of her staunchly pro-choice credentials, the information in this portion of the book sounds like an anti-reproductive rights broad side and therefore actually undercuts her own argument.<br />It is profoundly difficult to heed Solinger's call for a radical feminist overhaul of public policy when misinformation from the very classist and racist forces she opposes are held as sound historical research. Prior to the legalization of abortion, poor women of color were more likely to die from illegal procedures than their white affluent sisters.<br />In conclusion, this book would be acceptable when used in conjunction with a medium-sized reading list, but should never be studied as a single text on reproductive public policy.nd racist forces she opposes are held as sound historical research.

From lynching laws to the attack on social security and equal pay, the conservative movement has historically been on the wrong side of public policy issues.<br />The American Left could not have done as good a job as the right wing itself in proving how mean spirited, shortsighted, unrealistic and irresponsible the conservative movement really is for America. Indeed, the truth speaks for itself.<br />That Coulter would feverishly attempt to rebut fact through the frenzied treatise indicates she is also aware of the reality, and is trying to ignore it through a profound case of projection.	2002-06-29

Bush's Education Policies Will Affect Your Children and Our Schools	Books	1	6	13	N	N	A student with learning disabilities was affected	This book presents a rose colored perspective on the Bush adminstration's educational proposals--which in reality are far from ideal. Based on previous state-level experience, they will be a disaster if implemented at the federal level.<br />Both throughout my public schooling and undergraduate education, I was required to take Texas's academic programs, supposedly designed to measure minimum academic skills, but impossibly configured to assess the information learned by special education students. This policy contradiction was certainly noticed by state educators and bureaucrats, but oddly enough--real solutions to narrow the gap between established standards and student performance were never implemented.<br />Unlike my former Colorado school, special education students in Texas, irrespective of severity of disability were confined to a separate classroom with an overworked teacher who did not teach grade and ability appropriate curriculum, but just taught whatever was easiest for their own needs. Thus, disabled students would naturally operate at an educational level far bellow their mainstreamed peers whether this performance was in a &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;rich&quot; district.<br />During college, I was subjected to the whims of administrators who selectively ignored portions of federal law requiring the use of assistive technology on standardized tests for qualifying students. Although I was eventually able to graduate, I also became intimately familiar with the presence of bias in late 20th century higher education.<br />My experiences were not isolated, but a microcosm example of what in fact happened in Shrub's home state, ironically under the guise of \\"educational standards\\" and \\"educational reform\\".<br />Fortunate enough to be blessed with progressive parents who realized the proposals, then programs were actually code for dismantling civil rights gains, I know there are other parents and students who continue to remain unaware of the \\"real\\" costs of Bush's education program. They are a covert way of allowing the state to punish disabled students for both their disability and the subsequent magnification by unequal school funding and antiquated educational instructional policies.<br />It is politically easier to point fingers at children, blaming them for their own lot in life than to take a critical and comprehensive examination of flaws in the current educational delivery system<br />Given that during the presidential campaign, the Bush camp did not have much to say about disability rights and access; I have no illusions about his handler's intent to declare war on the progress wrought since the 1975 federal passage of laws guaranteeing equal educational opportunities to disabled students. Even if such attacks are camouflaged in talks of \\"standards\\" and \\"achievement\\" they ultimately create a climate where it is acceptable to attack \\"different students\\".<br />If their policies are not firmly held in check and opposed, the nation will travel back in time to an era where discrimination kept all of the country from reaching it's full potential.ts of Bush's education program.

The disclosure alternatley reassured and startled the author who realized that American society does not generally supply children of GLBTs with a \\"what to expect\\" guidebook.<br />Although I personally was not undergoing a story simmilar to hers, I was captivated by the frank prose and unyielding love for her father--irrespective of dad's gender. The journey was not easy for any of the family members (indeed, Howey takes care not to gloss over the contradictory feelings and internal frustrations that she experienced during her dad's transformation), but absolutley critical for the family's mental stability.<br />Our society loves to wax poetic on \\"family values\\" but does not neccesarily place compatible actions behind those words. Against all expectations and pronouncements from the larger society, the Howey family dealt with the revelation in a positive and empowering manner that ultimatley made the new family structure a zillon times stronger than their so-called \\"All American\\" model.<br />Even if you do not have a transgendered family member, it is impossible to read this book without crying, laughing or otherwise being reminded that good families come in all formats.	2002-05-29

This book is a continuation of the same circular logic that they subjected the world to during their odyssey.<br />As a person with a severe disability myself, I have little sympathy for people who intentionally go out of their way to place a pregnancy in circumstances that can give children a disability. Both Bobbi and Kenny were warned of the risk but apparently placed public relations dreams at a much higher priority than health and well-being.<br />Certainly, there is a degree of risk with every pregnancy from environmental factors, but to knowingly place children's health in danger because you have to have your own biological kids at all costs--irespective of who suffers---is selfish and emotionally immature.<br />There is nothing brave or heroic about increasing child suffering when there are numerous risk factors already in this world.	2002-05-22

Notably with the 1992 election of Bill Clinton, this group came out of the shadows of American politics, and their quest for equality was given unparralleled endorsement first from the campaign trail, and then the White House.<br />Although they as a discernable voting block tend to be more socially liberal than the general population at large, this does not neccesarily mean GLBT voters are anti-war or the oft-riddiculed \\"tax and spend liberal\\". Indeed, GLBT Americans can even be found as members (or at least supporters of) conservative political parties.<br />Hertzog's premise and supporting research argue that the potential electoral power of GLBT Americans has been historically undertaped (hindered by first a general climate of discrimination, and then the failure to inquire about sexual orientation on previous polling questionaires) and utlized by the major American political parties, but even the advances that happened in the 1990's still leave the community underutlized compared to both the general population and other community voting blocks.<br />He also looks at voting blocks within the GLBT commuinity and concludes that voters identifying as feminist will have less in common with the heterosexual society than non-feminist GLBT voters. These feminist voters are more likely to register as very liberal on social issues and much less likely to support a strong millitary-industrial complex.<br />Finally, Hertzog makes some interesting and (somewhat prophetic) predictions for the 1996 presidential elections. Despite uncovering evidence that the GLBT vote is not solidly Democrat, and GLBT's vote for Republicans who are socially moderate, he also warns that the GOP cannot expect to gain this vote if it continues to court people and organizations from the religious right.<br /><br />This book is heartily reccomended for political and social scientists who are interested in American voting patterns and civil rights movements.

The balanced perspective on America's most famous sitcom on seccond marriages and mixed families draws in readers who liked the show, but were never tremendous fans. Openly candid, Williams shares hillarious backstage hijinks that attempt to explain why these former child stars have managed to avoid the negative publicity that caught up with so many of their contemporaries.<br />True, the long-standing animosity between Robert Reed and Sherwood Schwartz is included, but this does not detract from the genuinely caring sentiment that cast members feel towards one another on and off cammera. The exact family composition may have been the work of a hollywood scriptwriter and casting director, but hollywood personnel could not have required these people to develop the strong personal bonds with eachother that only strengthened over time.<br />In keeping with the desire for a book transcending the typical low expectations for former Child Star memoirs, a suprisingly small lack of space is devoted to an apparent fling with co-stars Maureen McCormick and Florence Henderson. Certainly mentioned, both incidents are not excessively doted on by the author.<br />The overall focus of the text seems to be on how a shared sense of cooperation and commuinity among the cast helped a tv show about step-families become a favirote in the American pop psyche at a time when \\"stepfamily\\" still conotated various fairy-tale horror stories.	2002-05-11

Not unusual for sitting politicians to author books, it is unusual for those same works to have a heavily edited field, as if the aforementioned public figures were scared of making their opinions and research public, lest somebody become offended by differing proposals and ideas from their own.<br />Thankfully, this book suffers from no such shoddy writing. Even when under attack from individuals accustomed to \\"lite\\" political books, it has withstood time because of the utmost importance of the issues it raises within. Using a mix of physical and social sciences, Gore evaluates the crises facing modern earth and then theorizes possible solutions so all people can live in safety and security.<br />As the daughter of a geologist, previous reviews and publicity suggested I would find myself at odds with many of the ideas expressed in this work, but I came away with a greater understanding of environmental issues and a greater realization the planet would work much better if everything was in fact balanced appropriately.<br />At no point did I feel then-Senator Gore was disparaging anybody who worked in/had family or friends in the oil industry, but simply offering honest solutions to an unrelenting and semi-permanent problem faced by all residents of this planet. This text is the complete anti-thesis of the waffling politician.<br />That it was intially dismissed by many media outlets as kooky or off-beat shows just how far-sighted Gore actually is.	2002-05-11

Coincidentally, she does not ever attempt to figure out why she has garnered criticism from colleagues and business associates. Any critique is turned into continuation of this paranoid and largely factually devoid monologue.  <br />For many feminist such as myself, her lack of sensitivity to the need for racial and ethnic understanding is just as innappropriate were it coming from the mouth of Rush Limbaugh. Both individuals apparently love to hear themselves think outloud and become offended when dissenting views reveal that they are their own worst enemies. Although most other people in the women's movement have figured out that oppression is connected, she remained blissfully oblivious to the rest of the world until somebody had the strength to call her on it. <br />Basically, the spotlight has passed on Ms. Bruce and this book is a shoddy attempt to reclaim that--simply for publicity's sake. There is a big difference between being silenced and being held accountable for bigoted public statements, and if she genuinely cannot see the difference and/or truly does not care, then I am glad that she no longer wants to work aside myself and others in the movement.	2002-05-05

Furthermore, the debate over abortion is not so much about the status of the fetus, but the very meaning and place of woman's status in relation to the larger society.<br />Because that question cannot fully be examined without delving into how ecconomic status and ethnicity affect women's options, a multifaceted analysis is thoughtfully woven throughout the text. Abortion is only one dimension to women's health, and different options may be appropriate for the same woman at different points in a single life time.<br />Although the book is dated 1990, it should not pose a deterent to the scholar because the issues we are researching have essentially remained static through the past couple of years. Petchesky devotes separate chapters to teen sexuality policy and the funding attacks of the far right--issues that are now central to the question of choice.	2002-05-05

Although I prided myself on a good grasp of Roe prior to this point, reading the expansive text gave me a greater understanding and appreciation for the case.<br />While this book might be better suited for policy wonks and/or those with some legal training, the substantial read is definently worth it. Even if it is not as animated or lively as other histories of the historic 1973 Supreme Court decision, it is essential to understanding that case in the larger context of constitutional law and public policy. The right to privacy had gradually been building prior to the Roe case, and did not happen in a vaccum as some opponents would later claim.<br />The book concludes with an equally impressive account of the years following Roe and the combined impact of subsequent/rulings and legislation. Because this book does not rely on the &quot;interest groups/grassroots&quot; perspective, individuals in search of such information need to be prepared for further research.	2002-05-05

Better yet, she emphasizes that this struggle (through whatever means) is by nature hard, long and certainly not glamorus.<br />The best political organizing is not done for material or financial gratification, it is done for the betterment of all segments in the same society.<br />But it simmultaneously attacks it's own strong points through oversimplification of the facts regarding queer organizing in the late 20th and early 21st century.I feel that she is too quick to dismiss the contributions of groups such as HRC to the public policy table in favor of a romanticized version of policy making where radicals are the only ones doing any type of work to stop prejudice.<br />The HRC has attained and sustained numerous criticisms from people who believe the group's policies are a form of \\"sanitized\\" politics: because the group tends to court the more moderate politicians, it constructs a narrow context of gay rights suggesting that GLBT Americans are no different from their straight counterparts and can fit into the existing structures of society, only if they are allowed to.<br />In the fall of 2001, I worked on a local campaign that sought to halt passage of a ballot initiative prohibiting the Houston City council from even considering the offering of domestic partner benefits to GLBT municipal employees. The group I was with was a multicultural coalition of activists whose strategizing embraced the very radicalism Smith claims will bring true change.<br />Furthermore, HRC sent their representatives down to follow the agenda that we had already confirmed-although I realize much of the strategies and tactics differed from what they would have done in a similar situation without an existing radical coalition.<br />Even though I am personally more in line with Smith's idelogy, I also recognize that moderate civil rights groups provide a stepping stone for people new to political organizing---those who remain content with the level of analysis will stay with the organization, whereas the more politically assertive will look for other organizations who can fulfill their needs and address their issues in an appropriate manner as they begin to make deeper connections between their lot in life and the very structure of society itself.n. <br />Even though I am personally more in line with Smith's idelogy, I also recognize that moderate civil rights groups provide a stepping stone for people new to political organizing---those who remain content with the level of analysis will stay with the organization, whereas the more politically assertive will look for other organizations who can fulfill their needs and address their issues in an appropriate manner as they begin to make deeper connections between their lot in life and the very structure of society itself.	2002-04-28

Too convinentely, all of the &quot;credible sources&quot; he cites are unbalanced and very visibly envious of what this young man had accomplished while only in his 20's.<br />The right to explore all of a person's components is confused with the abusive practice of making up falsehoods about them to feel good about one's ownself.

What little rumor existed was not aired in the national news out of habit of tradition.<br />And then Watergate hit.<br />At the time of the incident, both men initially believed it was a standard robbery, but as they got involved in the story, they realized there were many more layers not immediately present. The &quot;low-level burgalars&quot; were ultimately connected to the executive branch and the United States intellegence community.<br />The final verdict in itself remains shocking, but adding to the intensity was the recognition that Nixon intentionally campaigned as the &quot;Law and Order candidate&quot; who would safeguard middle America. The contrast between the private and public personas amplified the scandal more than it otherwise would have been.<br />If the initial newsroom policy in this book seems antiquated in today's world of regularly investigated  political scandals, it is because a series of stories changed everything--for better or worse. After Watergate, the government would be subjected to more critical scrutiny and held accountable by the journalistic community. These two men set in motion a powerful legacy which extends well beyond their inital set of articles.<br />I had seen the movie before the book, and after reading this classic tome, can verify the pages have the same suspense and intensity (if not more so) as the big-screen counterpart.

Considering the plot of the story up to this point (and the far more painful impact of intensive childhood teasing) I did not think this portion of the story fit in with what Blume was apparently trying to accomplish. Again borrowing from my own background, I know I was not in a particulary forgiving mood to people who subjected me to teasing--and I did not think Linda should forgive and forget either.<br />Unlike much Children's litterature which is condescending and sugary-sweet (ie kids never do anything bad to each other, or if they do, it is something minor) Blume has always taken great pains to speak to their readers about the realities of life in age-appropriate language and issues. Yes, it is more somber than most of the non-science fiction children's litterature reccently coming out, but well worth the read.	2002-04-13

In a nation somewhat tempered by fresh reccollection of the horrors of McCarthyism, red-baiting and subsequent discreditation of those tarred with the label still ran rampant.<br />Understanding that her grim findings would never receive the light of day in a culture still gushy-eyed over the assumption that every housewife was automatically happy or that option was the only choice for women, she had to employ crafty PR strategies to make the book appealing for original publication and promotion. Her \\"new idenity\\" made her a far more appealing media source than a \\"radical labor activist\\" since it allowed her to avoid being blamed for her own stigmatization as one of those supposedly unnatural career women whose unhappiness must be self-inflicted.<br />As a member of third-wave feminism, I profess to having little initial interest in Friedan or her methodology. Because I lived in a world where with comparatively many more choices/rights, was aware of her own internal predjuduces towards intra-feminist movement diversity and antagonism towards Gloria Steinem, I usually wrote off Friedan as an anachronism who although important, was somebody I could not relate to directly. Since I was not married and was childless, I could not see myself in the pages.<br />After this book, I not only can see why she repackaged herself, but realized that I would do exactly the same thing in her position. I still disagree with Friedan on her minimialization of other feminist leaders, but have a new appreciation of her work and relevance.appreciation of her work and relevance.	2002-04-06

Although taken to a lesser extent than that of the Nazi's, the actual reality of the country's actions severely clashes with the images of freedom and justice used to marshall support for the war effort.<br />Paranoia and bias about the potential actions of a few people led to the stereotyping of millions. Their only crime was being of Asian descent in a world where racism and fear was rampant.<br />The actual event in itself is still shocking, but what is even more shocking was that it happened under one of the great liberals whose presidency had been irevocably cross-referenced with the quest for social justice. FDR had openly built his presidency on advocating for the disavantaged and giving them access to the American dream, something which obviously did not happen here.	2002-04-06

Indeed, the rise, regin and fall of the Taliban appears to be the first time that gender was used to create a system of apartheid.<br />While Afghanistan women are now only celebrating the lunar calendar New Year's without their restrictive burqua's, the memory of such apartheid is not likely to recceed from that country's collective conciousness or the women who fled for their human rights.<br />This book performs a tremendous public service to the world by ensuring that none of us outside of Afghanistan ever forget either. That the events and sittuations described in the book are completely true, makes them all the more chilling.	2002-03-24

What started out with promise and noble intentions (a real alternative to the airbrushed portrait of pregnancy and childbirth that is still being peddled)degenerated into a spoiled pitty party held for and by a wealthy self-proclaimed feminist who ignores and minimizes the ecconomic and racial disparities that still govern women's health care in the United states.<br />While she is whining about doctors versus midwives and drooling over glowing descriptions of yuppie America's deccorating style, it is overlooked that there are women for whom a Doula remains an ecconomic luxury that they simply cannot afford.<br />In an era of rapidly skyrocketing health care, the directives she put into her plan do not echo the concerns of everywoman who simply wants to find affordable health care, competent and respectful healthcare personnel in that order.<br />Wolf is commonly touted as a feminist voice for my generation, but the blatant lack of attention to the interconnected nature of oppressions (racism, classism, ageism, ableism) that govern the treatment of pregnant women in society is frankly embarassing. The experiences of a few rich Washington DC women are not adequate representation of the complexity of the female experience--either nationally or internationally.<br />No doubt that other women would also like a liberated birthing experience (after all low income women are more likely to end up in public hospitals with much less leverage to insist on their own preferences), but for Wolf's purpose they remain faceless anoynomous entities and the central focus is always on her own neeeds, her own concerns.<br />Additionally, she has either forgotten or does not care that Doris Haire and the Boston Women's Health Collective, among other sources produced early work on women's health and human reproduction that--suprise, found the very biases in the system she now claims to discover. The thoughts expressed in this book are neither original, nor progressive.	2002-03-24

The mass media, shortstaffed, and already enamored with the slick media image that is dubya did not devote serious resources to investigating election discrepancys and political connections.<br />Although I usually find myself at extreme odds with Mr. Buchannan's idea of \\"good public policy\\", the very fact that he also recognized the large percentage of votes could have not possibly been intended for him was indicative that something was trully rotten in the Sunshine state.	2002-02-24

Editors Mary Beth Norton and Ruth M. Alexander are college professors with long-standing publishing backgrounds in the field of women's history.<br />Although the concept of producing a compact reader was well intentioned, the principal problem with this work is it's over reliance on events and incidents prior to 1960.<br />Starting out as a means of showing women were involved in this country from it's beginning, the book unwittingly undercuts itself by not devoting as much time to the later accomplishments of American women's history.  Less fortunate students (without access to the numerous other far well written books) may leave whatever class this was used in with a sense of confusion about the roles of women in the 1960's through the present.<br />While the outdatedness of the customs and laws governing gender in those times now indicates how far we have come, it does not fully indicate the long and complex process that would perhaps be of interest to the same college students this text is intended for. It is very startling to realize that most of the issues and policies that have helped my generation (reproductive rights for college women, gender equity in educational facilities) were mere dreams when our mothers were attending school.<br />Certainly every professor has a specialized field-but when a general volume about a historically marginalized group is written, there is an unwritten assumption that this group will finally be getting the fair coverage that has long been it's moral due.<br />Even though I was fortunate enough to attend a University where women's history was adequately explored in every department, this book may sadly be the only initial contact for students at more conservative institutions. Because women's history remains undertaught in American institutions of higher education, I was hoping that two professionals in the field would want to show students a much more representative breadth and depth.<br />Students perhaps would be more interested if the text were more expanded to include the 1960's onward-when many of the rights that most impact campus life for women were first agitated for.<br />Should this text be used as a book for women's history, it would be wise to include \\"Dear Sisters\\" and \\"Unequal Sisters\\" as supplemental work for better understanding of women's history in general.nals in the field would want to show students a much more representative breadth and depth. <br />Students perhaps would be more interested if the text were more expanded to include the 1960's onward-when many of the rights that most impact campus life for women were first agitated for. <br />Should this text be used as a book for women's history, it would be wise to include \\"Dear Sisters\\" and \\"Unequal Sisters\\" as supplemental work for better understanding of women's history in general.	2001-12-19

Having grown up without many of the gender barriers that had plauged earlier generations, we were both more conditioned to live feminism, and less aware of the need for change compared to other generations.<br />Yet, Richards and Baumgardner also know this juxtaposition does not mean we want to see the clock turned back on women's progress any more than previous generations of activists and current activists do. A combination of personal discussions, pop culture and political references explicitly make it clear that two young women are writing this for themselves and others who share their same perspective on life.<br />Although they champion second wave feminists like Gloria Steinem for reaching out to young women and trully respecting their own paths and projects, Richards and Baumgardner also do not hide disdain for feminist elders who are self-absorbed, ageist and condescending. Indeed, the authors note these women forget that long after they have passed on, the young will be left running feminist organizations---and it would be so much better if we were seriously mentored now instead of reinventing everything while simmultaneously trying to stave off attacks from our generation of the far right.	2001-12-09

This book chronicles the images of females in baby-boom popculture and how they reflected and shaped politics.<br />Because women have been historically consigned to the private sphere of home and hearth, the idea that our tv and mass media images can alter society is a riveting idea. Douglas then backs up this thesis with an admirable amount of intensive research and personal recollection that travels from Gracie Allen to Northern Exposure.<br />Although the book was primarily intended for babyboom women's culture, I am old enough to remember the rise of the superwoman as personified in Wonder Woman and Charlie's Angels and how this new genere was designed for both male tittilation and female admiration. Meanwhile, myself and other first graders loved the show because people who looked like us (hopefully when we were older) were the center stars of the show.<br />While I am now eagerly awaiting a revised and expanded edition with chapters on Buffy, Xena and Charmed, the book still provides an excellent example of the un-ending struggle between feminist and anti-feminist influences in the American mass media. No self-respecting feminist of any age ought to be without this awesome and well-researched tome.	2001-12-09

While this assessment ironically does lend credence to the idea that anybody can become published in this country if they are sensational and partisan enough, it also reveals a very embittered spoiled woman who was almost fanatical in her disregard for the very concept of ethics she was bent on investigating others for violating.	2001-12-09

On the other hand, it appropriated some of the very same imagery and concepts that people such as myself found repugnant such as overly simplistic notions of faith and family.<br />Morris's observations come from a man who was in the trenches of what many people said was impossible past the 1960's--a two term Democratic adminstration that managed to retain the support of more solidly left groups on civil rights, reproductive issues and idenity politics while reaching out and embracing fiscal conservatives and moderates who would other wise believe that every democrat is uniformally of the &quot;Tax and Spend&quot; and &quot;godless&quot; variety.<br />Indeed, there is a certain irony that a man who encouraged the Democratic party to downplay some of it's most distingushing principles on social policy wound up himself subject to some virtrolic character examinations following public disclosure of a political affair of his own. Although the resulting fallout did not profoundly impact his boss's success, it did damage Morris's own ability to effect political change and realignment.<br />What had seemed creepy and moralizing before now appeared to be laughably hypocritical and ironically self-serving.	2001-12-05

Although I now realize there were people voicing conciencious objection to war with Iraq (because among other reasons, we had once supported Saddam Hussein's rise to power including oulfiting his troops with weapons when it suited our international interests and did not seriously care what would happen to the people of Iraq afterwards), if given any coverage in the national news at all, they were riddiculouslsy marginalized as outcasts who were living in a gigantic timewarp and did not understand that this was the 1990's.<br />My parents, having lived through Vietnam, were more cynical about the millitary opperation--but did not challenge the advertising marketed towards their daughter for fear of being perceived as unsupportive of America's objectives. Because they realized that the Gulf War was fought partly over US Petroleum interests, support was actually a more complex issue than I was receiving from media, institutional, and peer socialization.<br />MacArthur and Bagdikian provide a wealth of information for anybody who wants to revisit this time in international/American history and uncover the truth that all too quickly disappeared and was ommitted in the name of national unity. The so-called &quot;liberal-media&quot; defered to government preferences and reporting angles in it's coverage of the Persian Gulf, reducing 20 years of profoundly complex relations in this region of the world to a binary presentation of &quot;good guys v. bad guys&quot;. The ultimate loosers in this scenario of course are the American people who never get to see the full justifications of their leaders, policy makers and public officials.<br />Although we think of information suppression as something that was supposed to be eliminated with post-Vietnam millitary oversight procedures and policies, they continued during this event---in an albeit more subtle way. In the world of public policy, just because you cannot see something does not mean that it is non-existent.<br />Granted, looking at a gritter past may be hard, but this action is neccesary to fully understand how media and politics work together in times of war--and not necessarily for the benefit of the citizens at large.

Unlike Steinem, Pogrebin, Davis, hooks, etc.. Chesler conveniently forgets that we have lived through the changes wrought by her generation and thus do not want to return to the old days.<br />Although the book is written as a series of conversations , it actually comes off as a stern one-sided lecture where our interjections of knowlledge are not solicited nor welcomed. This self-contratulatory platitude continues despite evidence that generations of people intentionally raised on feminist principles are comming of age, and therefore are more aware of gender issues than she chooses to realize.<br />In fact, we are less likely to perceive those changes in women's status as threatening because of having grown up alongside them. Feminism is a natural language for my generation, and the activist among us are already intimately fammilar with the basics repitiously presented in this book.<br />Additionally, we have our own subculture of feminist industries (Riot Grrrl Music, independent zines, webpages, and prolific writers/public speakers) demonstrating that we know the battle has not completely been won, and previously secured rights must continuously be defended.<br />Instead of issuing an angry and self-righteous screed, the least she could have done was familiarize herself with our work, and our feminist culture. Even if the words and issues are not exactly identical to those of her generation, our contributions to feminist thought are no less valid and deserve to be treated seriously.<br />Because this aforementioned young feminist culture was exposed to the mainstream light in the 1990's partly from the influence of popular artists such as the late Kurt Cobain (Nirvana)-it is difficult to believe Chesler did not know young feminists were organizing or there were projects (such as Rock for Choice) that were continuing the work her generation had begun decades earlier.<br />With a more proactive and realistic perspective on youth organizing, she could have reached out to my generation, but the patronizing tone effectively undercut whatever sincerity she may have had for helping continue activism. Although she played an important role in the past, this book suggests she will be unable to make different future contributions.t is difficult to believe Chesler did not know young feminists were organizing or there were projects (such as Rock for Choice) that were continuing the work her generation had begun decades earlier. <br />With a more proactive and realistic perspective on youth organizing, she could have reached out to my generation, but the patronizing tone effectively undercut whatever sincerity she may have had for helping continue activism.

The meteoric rise to fame was accompanied by a string of personal issues that were not considered appropriate to air at the time-consequently he was more glum than one might think. The book chronicles his relationship with the rest of the cast (especially co-star Susan Dey) his agent and especially his father, actor Jack Cassidy. Despite the liberated premise of the Partridge family, Cassidy's real life experience was more ambivalent. Because dysfunctional family had not entered popular culture at that point in time (and references to those families were invariably slanted towards lower economic classes) Cassidy did not have the words to describe what he was feeling at the time, except he understood that he was frustrated about the past and the bizarre dichotomy between his public and private personas. At the end of the day, he was a person who was simply looking for somebody to truly love him for himself and not as his on screen alter-ego Keith Partridge. Unfortunately, he did not quite know what else he wanted yet, and this book does an excellent job of taking the reader through that sometimes painful and difficult journey. Although the revelations contained in this book might be too frank for some people, I personally found them a refreshing antidote to the star biographies which are super slick. The ability to be candid with who you are and what your needs are is an important step in the journey to finding your true self.	2001-08-26

In 1981, his only son Adam Walsh was abducted from a Sears store at age 6. The resultant investigation and twists spurned the elder Walsh's crusade for justice. Although his son's case remains unsolved, Walsh remains dedicated to the cause of missing children everywhere.<br /><br />Although my background as a constitutional researcher makes me leery of most victims rights advocates (whose well intentions try to eliminate the constitutional safe guards they would likely want in a similar situation) I am predisposed to respect Walsh whose mission began and remains with noble pursuits of justice for all.<br /><br />Not one to mince words, Walsh's account of the ordeal takes us first to the picture of a serene family unraveled by a predator and then of parents fighting for their son's name and those of kids every where who had previously disappeared without people really wondering why. Although child abductions had been occurring for decades, the Walsh case was an example of a new willingness to expose it as a public crime instead of a private family matter. Believe it or not, there were legislators who actually considered the idea of missing children's legislation a joke.<br /><br />That such callousness could happen struck me as particularly cruel and disheartening, but the Walsh story reaffirms the idea that a small group of people with enough determination can really change the world. It is to Walsh's credit that the naysayers were silenced and whole generations of children and their relatives now have social and legal recourse against repeat incident when they do occur.<br /><br />I am not particularly a sentimental person, but this book still moves me to tears (as does the movie) every time I visit this case again. In terms of gruesome emotion, Freddy Krueger, Chucky and the like have nothing on this case for fear levels.

Were he not so passionate about the ideals he believed in, even as characters such as Dick Morris siphoned away the populist spin, he would have not cared as much as he did when he did.<br />If the early Clinton White House can be faulted for being left of center by some people, the intentions by early Clinton staffers were genuinely motivated out of concern for the less fortunate and maligned. Their Ivy league idealism gave younger gen-xers such as myself hope that we would be better represented by this administration. Whatever Clinton's real intentions, Stephanopolus wanted to celebrate diversity and progressive ideals through the public policy process.<br />While this idealism would theoretically seem ingrating, the author weaves his tale in such a way to draw sympathy from the reader. Stephenopolus is not a faceless bureaucrat, but somebody with real feelings and dreams. Aside from the heavy politics, there are lighter moments woven into the book as well such as the revelation that Vice President Gore's sense of humor hilariously contrasted with his staid public image. Even administration devotees like myself were laughing along at the punch lines.<br />Less funny however is the stress encountered by the author. Despite his stellar academic and political career, he never seemed to know how to effectively manage stress until it was too late. Of course by then, he desperately needed to preserve his health and thus resigned. I am concerned how a Columbia graduate could have remained oblivious to his own well-being until it affected his dream job and even his personal relationships with his girlfriend.<br />Neverless, this is a book that will leave all readers--irespective of political affiliation-impressed.graduate could have remained oblivious to his own well-being until it affected his dream job and even his personal relationships with his girlfriend. <br />Neverless, this is a book that will leave all readers--irespective of political affiliation-impressed.	2001-08-26

While this would be a superb primer for somebody who is new to feminist theory (especially in the late 20th century) I know there was more to the movement than was included in the selection. For some odd reason, the content was much skimpier than it logically would have been, and the layout left much to be desired for visual asthetics. Photographs of the demonstrations/actions would have helped to break up the monotony of a very intense book and reinforced the energy that the movement exuded. I was disappointed that the book was not more visually engaging for those readers who wanted to delve further into the roller-coaster experience that was the women's movement. Also disappointing is the black and white format of the booklet. Even with less advanced graphic design and mimeograph machines, the women's liberation movement produced some awesome graphics and brochures in vibrant colors. In this respect, the book unwittingly undersells itself to potential audiences--both vetrans and newcomers to feminism alike.	2001-08-26

Thus, if they were locked up, society would know where they were at all times while being able to pretend that they did not exist to begin with. Indeed, when Blatt and Kaplan's expose appeared, it set off controversy from those who had the audacity to defend the charges against very quickly turning public sentiment.<br />Although they are certainly free to articulate what they consider flaws with the book, it is difficult to believe that critics of this work would actually want to downplay the seriousness of these (and other) investigations if they were in those instutitions. Indeed, I strongly suspect they would want to be treated like human beings and given adequate care and a stimmulating environment.<br />As a diabled person myself, the contents of the book hit very close to home. Fortunate enough to be born in 1979, I realized that had I been born 20 years earlier, I most likely would have been  one of the unfortunate people in the institutions investigated in this essay. While I previously had been aware of the disability rights movement's work in this area, reading this book gave me a whole new perspective on my work as a disability rights activist.<br />Because this book was never positioned as an indictment of all facilities, I am suprised by the rather hostile nitpicking and the blanket statement allegations. I believe this says more about the individuals reviewers than the quality of the authors themselves, and should not be weighted when looking at this book.The institutions in this essay were picked because the actual practices stood in sharp contrast to the &quot;help and loving environment&quot; they promised parents and relatives that patients would get. Woe is the person who even suggests that this was not as bad as people have made it out to be.<br />If it is difficult to believe the conditions doccumented in this book, it is because of the continued ease with which society is encouraged to view disabled people as helpless children, rather than potential Supreme Court nominees, doctors, lawyers etc...Ironically, baby and bath allegories demonstrate the urgency with which this book should be designated as required reading for anybody considering a degree in social sciences or a job in a related field.tives that patients would get.

Instead, women were maimed from illegal abortions, gays were bashed at an alarming rate, schools were segregated, the disabled were hidden and sexual and domestic violence supposedly did not happen to \\"good\\" people.  Telling it like it really was is not a PC fairy tale, but a practical reality if we are to finally confront and undo some of America's social problems.<br />Politicians, particularly on the right, have been successful in exploiting and appropriating this myth for their own personal means precisely because there have been few watchdogs to challenge them. Were this possible, we would discover the new left had its roots in the backlash against Senator Joe McCarthy and his communist witch hunts. The cover picture with a young Robin Morgan is particularly ironic in light of the fact that the former \\"Mama\\" child star reincarnated herself as one of the most prolific and articulate leaders of the new left and women's liberation in the 1960's.<br />Family Values have become such an emotional election issue because we are not really sure what they mean. Sure, any politician (indeed most do out of a fear of being perceived as anti-family) can embrace the concept and even make a career out of such proclamations, but our realities have been less than stellar pictures.<br />The section on teenage pregnancy and unwed mothers confirms that the higher rates occurred before the legalization of birth control and the relegalization of abortion and the only difference is that girls who chose to keep their babies are not shipped off to maternity homes or forced to leave school. Additionally, she points out the young girls who engage in sexual activity are not feminists because they are more likely than non-sexually active peers to have very strong dependence needs and desires as well as traditional gender roles.<br />I also believe Coontz should have done more investigating on the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse and the legal system that essentially encouraged it by allowing it to go unchecked. In the greatest of ironies, the decade where GLBT Americans enjoyed the least amount of rights was also the times when child hood sexual abuse was the highest. However, I realize Coontz was trying to provide a general overview with this book and believe that the subsection could provide enough material for a separate book of its own.<br />While I realize it may be difficult for some readers to reconcile starry-eyed visions with this more pragmatic account, the resulting intellectual growth is a concise picture of what America was really like. Perhaps now, the religious right will quit screaming and join the proactive discussion on family life.pped off to maternity homes or forced to leave school.

Decriminalization of birth control and relegalization of Abortion broadened the organization's mission and the women of color health movement pioneered a multifaced class-concious lens through which to work.<br />Ironically, the standard of measurement blindly advocated in this book would also require public schools and accomodations to be under attack with the same venom, because they also had several policies now recognized as elitist.<br />Disagree with Sanger if you must, but don't run around confusing the current organization with earlier operations.	2001-06-16

The predominantly male movement has formed alliances with conservative political groups that condem whichever option women ultimately chose. The real goal is creation of a theocracy where women do not have control over their own lives.<br />The political leaders know their language stirs up passion in people, and therefore have not stopped using it yet. The &quot;crazies&quot; are the shock troops in their holly war, and will never be silenced, despite media assurances to the contrary.<br />Reading this book is an eye opening experience for anybody who is undecided about the abortion issue, or people who believe that the &quot;right-to-life&quot; movement is really about compassion and protecting lives. Reitter has background in the conservative movement, and his credentials lend a considerable amount of weight and influence to this expose.	2001-06-14

Bans on abortion (which were not enacted until the turn of the 20th century) were not a measure of fetal protection, but a response to the realities of Victorian double standards and antisepsis.<br />While legislators could have just as easily prohibited tonsilectomies, they decided to focus on a procedure exclusively related to women because conventional logic held women did not realy like sexual relations (even with their husbands)--only doing it to become mothers, and the act of procreation was what ultimately made husbands faithful.<br />Most educated people now also know that if a husband is truly determined to leave his family, a wife's desire for children will not produce a serious change of heart.  Furthermore, the birth control methods that we take for granted were not available, and many of the foremothers of feminism mentioned in this book were also ingrained with the idea that good girls did not talk about anything sexual period.<br />During that time period, it was not uncommon for &quot;well-respected&quot; husbands to have extramartial affairs, and they unsuprisingly brought home sexually transmitted diseases. In the age of AIDS, this silence is not only impractical, but outright dangerous. Yet, according to this model, we have to return to the exact set of sexual circumstances governing early feminists. No thank you.<br />The advent of penicillin and antibiotics in the 1930's meant that infections could be prevented, although laws restricting LEGAL abortion still remained on the books. THe law failed to keep up with medical advances and as a result, non-connected women and their fetuses suffered at the hands of unskilled quacks who wanted to exploit the desparation of women legally prohibited from using doctors.<br />It is unrealistic to assume Anthony and Stanton would have opposed the relegatization of abortion in the 1960's and 1970's, just as it is to assume their actions and words in an earlier era would still have the exact same relevance today.<br />To use their support against racism as an analogy, although they had very enlightened attitudes for their time, Anthony and Stanton's language and acceptance of segregated facilities is unquestionably antiquated and unprogessive in today's world. However, this is the logical parallel to the anti-abortion movement's historical revisionism.ssume Anthony and Stanton would have opposed the relegatization of abortion in the 1960's and 1970's, just as it is to assume their actions and words in an earlier era would still have the exact same relevance today.<br />To use their support against racism as an analogy, although they had very enlightened attitudes for their time, Anthony and Stanton's language and acceptance of segregated facilities is unquestionably antiquated and unprogessive in today's world.

The authors could have sugar coated the harsh realities of that world, but wisely chose to tell the whole truth to their elementary age target audience.<br />If ever there were a case where the Congressional Medal of Honor should be given out to a team of Children's Literature writers and illustrators, this team certainly has earned it.<br />In this installment, Addy is reuinted with her baby sister ester after what seemed like an eternity. While the previous reunions with her father and her brother were also emotional, the symbolism of shadows moving forward in a Church is especially powerfull. Her beloved Uncle Solomon has died, but has found peace because of his brief status as a free man.<br />The end of the book, which provides a historical recap is especially touching because it goes all the way into the civil rights movement of the 1950's and 1960's. Considering many public school districts give this portion of American History little attention (whether on purpose or not) I feel it is especially important for young women to read this particular portion of the American Girl's series.	2001-06-13

His history of the sexual revolution differs from earlier works such as Playboy's own (largely self-indulgent volume) because it readily gives credit where it is due to women and non-heterosexuals.<br />While the sexual revolution was supposed to be for the benefit of everybody in young America, the continued difficulty of securing contraception, the illegality of abortion, and loco parentis policies in Colleges made the concept an intially hollow promise for many women. Others, working in the new left quickly discovered they were expected to be little more than a Housewife/Sex object with an armband and picket sign to their male counterparts.  Sexism was so pervasive the doublestandard was just repackaged in psychedelic garb.<br />The author points out it was feminists and gay liberationists who challenged narrow defintions of sexuality and brought the sexual revolution closest to accheiving it's utopian vision.<br />Because most other conventional histories of the 60's ignore or marginalize the contributions of these groups, this book should be required reading as part of a college course on the 1960's. Far from being monolithic, the sexual revolution had many unsung leaders, and we could not have the discussions on safe sex today were it not for these pioneers.	2001-06-12

I'll give you a hint---it wasn't who the public wanted.<br />From the begining, Al Gore never acted like he was entitled to win the presidency, rather he listened to what the voters actually wanted and offered real solutions. Deeply saddened by Gore's concession, I now realize the eloquence of that speech guarantees the voters will select a Democrat in 2004.<br />The GOP-manufactured claim that the Democrats invalidated millitary voting ballots was simply riddiculous. Al Gore, having served in Vietnam, is a millitary vet and has the experience so many conservatives were insistent that Clinton should have had. Now that they were up against a candidate whom they could not smear with that allegation, they insisted that Bush was the infinently more patriotic. Excuse me, but there is no legitimate way partying in Houston bars during in-state National Guard service counts as millitary service	2001-06-12

Because the names mentioned in this book may be unfammilar to a large number of Americans, this book could have wound up as an enlarged ego trip, but name dropping is balanced with clear examples of street actions and demands.<br />It would have been much easier to write off or down play the erractic behavior of some of the media-annointed (many of the early groups with New Left refugees rejected a hierarchy in favor of collective consensus) leaders of the women's movement, but Brownmiller sympathetically and crtically examines their contributions to the larger goal of eradicating sexism. As far out as some of these women were, their flamboyant media personalities were in retrospect what the movement needed to have impact long after the male left was delegitimized.	2001-06-12

I respect the work she has produced, but cannot see why a book of this size was produced when there was no lack of research materials for her to work with.<br />The book comes across better as a series of case studies rather than a historical or politcal retrospective, and needs to be reclassified as such. Perhaps I will be accused of nitpicking, but with the right mounting another round of attacks on GLBT rights, we need to understand what resources we have available for our use.<br />As mentioned ealier, this book is worded in a way that would appeal to freshman or new GLBT studies students. It is important that people of all sexualities understand the struggles for LGBT rights and its continued relevance.	2001-06-06

Ironically, these attacks reinforce the very need for the book. Women's issues are still denigrated (although less obvious than in previous generations) by society as being too trival, and those who bring them up are accused of some degree of psychosis.<br />Muscio also looks at why we can talk about male anatomy galore, but menstruation remains taboo in our society. Yes, pads and tampons are advertised on television, but emphasis is on secrecy and concealment, instead of talking about it openly and admitting that it is as natural as breathing.<br />The title may make some readers blanch (or avoid reading the book all together), but this text is not devoid of serious thought or criticisim. At the very least, it should ignite a serious discussion about what we are not saying about women's bodies and the words and meanings we assign to them.	2001-06-04

For better or for worse, the author could have taken a more serious and critical attitude, but his free admittance of bobo status is meant to assure the reader that nobody is perfect, but we all must work together if there are going to be serious efforts to undo the more destructive components of this mindset. <br />America is not exactly known for being receptive to class studies, and the author is smart enough to package this radical topic in a seemingly benign package poking fun at familiar elements of pop culture.

Faderman simply points out the important role that Lesbians have played---a contribution that gets over shaddowed in many straight women's and gay men's focused history books.	2001-06-03

For better or for worse, the author could have taken a more serious and critical attitude, but his free admittance of bobo status is meant to assure the reader that nobody is perfect, but we all must work together if there are going to be serious efforts to undo the more destructive components of this mindset.<br />America is not exactly known for being receptive to class studies, and the author is smart enough to package this radical topic in a seemingly benign package poking fun at familiar elements of pop culture. While it is not as direct as Marx, Keyes, Greenspan or other ecconomic theorists, this book is also concerned with the study of money and power.	2001-06-03

While I personally do not care for the Newshour with Jim Leherer on PBS (which is not leftwing)I at least know the host will not resort to juvenile diatribes against people with which he politically disgrees with. News is not confused with mean-spirited commedy.<br />As a journalist, I find Limbaugh's format appaling. Even if he intends the show to be a joke, he has formated the show so listeners are either confused by the difference, or don't realize it. Of course, this makes them incredibly vunerable to whatever proclaimation he decides to issue that particular day because they have been so warped.	2001-06-03

Although election 2000 was anything but typical, the mass media were accomplices in one of the most undemocratic acts in history. Because a disproportionate of the undercounted voters were African American or Jewish, it is impossible to rule out civil rights violations.<br />Yet, this is what the Supreme Court did. Even today, I shudder as I read the smirking and self-righteous oppinion by the justices. Simply because Americans may vote a different way than what the Bush campaign wanted, the court decided to pull the plug on the recount and &quot;finalize&quot; the election from hell.<br />In fact, hell may be too nice a word to describe what this most undemocratic action did for America and the remains of our international reputation (already tattered from the Starr inquisition)A nation that ignores the selection of the people might as well not have democratic elections to begin with---a frightening but entirely realistic observation if the behavior of the Supreme Court is to be legitimized.<br />Myself and many other intellegent Americans will never extend recognition to King George as the leader of our country.

There are times where Bush unintentionally one-ups the already superior spoofs of himself as the perpetual 4 year old.<br />I am sure Daddy is still wondering where all of that tuiton money went, because it obviously did not expand Junior's vocabulary. To think that this man is our defense against nuclear war would be completely hillarious----if we did not actually have to worry about international enemies.<br />Maybe it is all of the years of alcohol and coccaine abuse, but Bush's syntax is completely age-inappropriate, and I feel completely sorry for his wife Laura.  If I were in her shoes, I would wonder what I was thinking when I married a man who was certifiably below my intellectual level.<br />Buy this book for your entertainment, and then pass it on to your area Republicans to let them know what their brainless leader is really like.

Quite the contrary, it impedes the true scientific process.<br />It is neither liberal or elitist to insist that grown scientists adhere to the same ethical standards we require school children to exhbit in their science classes, and merely reflects the internalized anger of this has-been and his followers. The simplistic assumption presumes that hate and misinformation packaged in &quot;clinical sounding&quot; terms must be accepted by the majority of the dominant society.<br />While the material is good for a laugh and to show how enlightened society has become, it should not be confused with serious research or medical advice.	2001-06-01

While the early women's history movement has been faulted for being predominantly middle class heterosexual and white, this book attempts to build a more complete future by giving a voice to the issues.<br />I wish everybody had access to this substantive piece of literature because it provides an excellent introductory and supplementary framework for research and even political organizing.

The humor is subtle enough for adults and others to grasp it, and the undeniably cheesy and fun sketches will keep you rolling on the floor with laughter and guffaws.<br />Out of all the things Saturday Night Live has transformed into a skit post Wayne's World, the X Presidents is surely most deserving of this tribute, as well as an entire movie of their very own.

To date, the primary sites are in Austin and Houston---I felt somewhat fortunate because I lived in the latter during the summers and holiday breaks, but enough is enough.<br />A glance inside this book will tell you that the myriad rules and regulations governing this program are enough to make your head spin (and possibly implode). Sure, it sounds impressive on paper, but the program is a bureaucratic nightmare for disabled students who can be shuffled from one step to another without few good explainations about what is actually going on.<br />Even now, I shudder when I remember how much time and energy I spent on trying to solve a test that was not even remotely designed to measure what I had learned from years of special education classes. It appeared the majority of adminstrators were parroting the virtues of this program without actually thinking about how it would work in real life.	2001-04-14

Although he is also unflattering toward Tripp, the author blows Clinton's flaws way out of proportion and thus becomes his own worst enemy in the long and painful process of reconstructing (or even making up) the facts.<br />The embittered tone of the book makes it perfectly clear that the author is largely mad because he got scooped by internet tabloid mogul Matt Drudge. This implies he cares about little else and the &quot;investigative&quot; attitude was just a fantastic cover-up so he could get his name on the &quot;A list&quot; by any concievable means possible.<br />The majority of people knew about Clinton's penchant and did not care because he was not pointing accusatory fingers at us or attempting to act like he was better than us simply because he was president.

Buchannan is as conservative as they come.<br />He and his supporters were the ones who in 1992 caused my party to retake the white house because of the excesively hard line on social issues at the Houston TX national GOP convention. Because Bush Sr.'s campaign was so afraid of ailenating the religious conservative powerbase, they essentially let this group declare open season on anybody who did not fit into the traditional mold. of the ideal American.<br />Furthermore, Roosevelt supported women's suffrage. Judging by his retrograde concepts of women's work (no, having your sister as a campaign manager does not make you a liberated man)Buchannan also does not care about the needs of women voters. Buchannan has openly denounced the concept of abortion, birth control and the equal rights amendment because they violate his relgious beliefs---without even stoping to think how somebody else may view those things.<br />Buchannan's inability to realize the neccesity of a global market also renders him obsolte to the modern American system of government and politics. Because of technological advances, the question is no longer going to be &quot;Do we have to work with people of different countries?&quot;, but rather &quot;When are we going to work with people from different countries.&quot;	2001-04-11

Hook's work is radical because it forces readers to deal with the less than favorable aspects of American history.<br /><br />Confronting the real truth about America and the way it has historically treated and maligned women of color (and how they moblized against this) can be a challenging read, but only if the reader comes in with a defensive mind, prepared to discount the work anyway. Individuals with an open mind should love the pages of this now-classic work.<br /><br />I have always loved this book and it's practical insights on gender roles and a multifaceted approach to reproductive rights. Although Hooks is pro-choice, she reminds us that legalized abortion should be only one aspect of reproductive rights, and  freedom from sterilzation abuse and full information on contraceptives is also important. It is a testament to Hooks and other activists that this paradigm has been adopted by the general feminist movement.<br /><br />True women's liberation involves the liberation of all women from all artificially constructed notions about gender and ethnicity. While we as a nation have historically seen the civil rights movement as primarily for black men, and the feminist movement as being for white women, we have silenced and subjugated the black feminist who has one foot in each of these communities and is going to weave together her own experiences.	2001-04-11

I was onvinced that somebody at the publishing house decided to play a really cruel trick on me and the world by melding the best of Ms. together with the worst of teen and traditional magazines---and then packaging it as the end all and be all to women's liberation.<br /><br />At best, it is overly cute in some places, at worst it completely ignores the work that vetrans of the women's movement did, and the work which needs to do. It takes a rather binary approach to women's issues and body image. I was amazed at how many one-type of women was featuered throughout the pages.<br /><br />Cheerleading the \\"new girl revolution\\" works up to a point, then the intellegent people are going to start wondering how they can change their collective and individual lots in life.<br /><br />Many more people could have been reached if the authors balanced their poppy (almost condescending tone) with suggestions for action and strategy. Yes, change can be long hard and difficult, but anything is better than listening to overindulged young women mock the advances of previous generations as too serious and boring.<br /><br />Hello, real life is not supposed to be a 30-minute sitcom, and bad things can happen to you when you are not aware of what is going on and how to fight back.  That these women completely ignore the struggles of queer, minority, disabled, and working class women is completely innappropriate and unacceptable.<br /><br />The \\"agenda\\" the book delivers is narrowly construed to appeal to over indulged white young women/girls of a certain kind. Therefore it misses out on the best part of feminism. Solidarity with all kinds of women (and men) to adress and undo sexism and the connected evils (racism, homophobia, classism, ableism)<br /><br />It is a shame the editors of this book did not consider that the new girl might actually have a longer attention span than a hyperactive sixth grader.

It describes the years leading up to and immediately after the event to give readers a powerful foundation for today's policy agenda.<br /><br />Providing additional information, the selected pictures are also very helpful; I finally saw what the Stonewall Inn had looked like. That people were congregating at an underground dump made a very big impression on somebody who grew up seeing gay pride parades and `out' public figures. I now fully understand the political meaning of `out'.<br /><br />However, I am just not crazy about the format which is used to present this important piece of American history. Duberman periodically switches between people's personal stories.<br /><br />At least to me, this felt like walking into a room with a conversation already in progress and then trying to follow along. It makes reading this otherwise great book unnecessarily tedious. Another edition of this book needs to just tell the story without trying to switch around between personal testimonies.	2001-03-26

States could have just as easily decided to ban tonsilectomies and appedectomies, but chose a procedure uniquely experienced by women.<br />Finally, there is a danger in assuming the words of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony were always on the mark. Although both women were ahead of their day for some aspects of women's rights, they were also behind on issues of race, sexuality and class and the interconnected nature of women's oppression.<br />It is dangerous to assume that any historical figure would have all the answers to current issues, and this &quot;historian&quot; needs to replace starry-eyed fantasy with pragmatic investigation before trying to pass off this work as infalible.	2001-03-11

Even in Hollywood, there was a closet policy for a while. Those people who did appear in the magazine were courageous.<br />In 1972, Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA) became the first presidential candidate to strongly go on record supporting full equality for gay and lesbian Americans. While much has been made about the increasing conservatism in the nation's capitol, a look at Kennedy's voting record and press statements confirms that Kennedy's stance for equality has only hardened over time. Today, the Massachusetts Democrat is considered more ideologically pro-gay than Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.<br />The only problem with this book stems from the lack of cover photos to see how the magazine has changed over the years. Although the text tells us it evolved from a newspaper to a glossy magazine, my journalistic background means I get a lot more out of seeing the progression for myself.<br />Certainly, there are people who would argue the glossy transformation defanged the potential for liberation, and I think this is a valid point, but I also see the argument for using gloss and mainstreaming the magazine. Not only will you reach more GLBT people (some of whom are more conservative) but you will also develop credentials with the mainstream media, which will more directly influence the direction of public policy.<br />Although Bull is frustrated that his own magazine was as unenlightened as the straight press when it came to early reporting on AIDS, I can understand the schizophrenia After all of the victories won in the 1960s and 1970's. the largest threat to the community was a silent killer apparently transmitted through  lovemaking.

Because the idea of young girls rescuing older men is radical even by today's standards (tradditional culture says it should be the other way around) this is inspiring for young women. Ms. Tripp shows that women have as much right to take charge of a dangerous sittuation as young men do.<br />In this book alone, Felicity argues with Ben, gets dirty and sweaty and devises a successfull rescue plan. This is a long ways from the &quot;dainty behavior&quot; that was prefered by her society. Throughout the book other characters attempt to remind her to be more ladylike only to come up short--Felicity is too independent for their tastes.<br />Even though the fictional story is set in the past, I am willing to bet it will inspire more than a few girls to acchieve their dreams.	2001-03-08

Defying conventional wisdom which held innagural issues were especially supposed to be devoid of controversy, the magazine published a list of prominent American women who had undergone illegal abortions and wanted repeal of laws restricting women's reproductive rights.<br />Even though the magazine itself had several writers with extensive prior experience, it was committed (especially in the early days) to non-hierarchial management and production. While this ethos would later become modified and refined, it proved these people were dedicated to practicing the equality they preached about. Ms. was also one of the first magazines to offer day care for the children of its employees.<br />Certainly, most people will think of Gloria Steinem, but she would be the first to downplay her role in publicizing the magazine. While Steinem admired the politics of the women's liberation movement, she also knew society would not change unless there was some kind of way to bring the &quot;movement&quot; to areas where it was not particulary active yet.<br />She realized that there were people who were feminists, but did not have ready access to the limited production mimeographs of the movement or would not neccesarily know how to obtain them (women's studies was not yet a particularly large book market). By looking &quot;mainstream&quot; the magazine could bring numerous converts to feminism.<br />Although Steinem's modesty was undebatable by those who knew her well, others (who wanted the publicity) brought elaborate but false charges against her in the mid 1970's. It is worth noting that both Ms.'s former employee Betty Harris and the radical group Redstockings have disappeared off of the face of the earth while Steinem and Ms. continue to be advocates for sisterhood and women's empowerment.ere people who were feminists, but did not have ready access to the limited production mimeographs of the movement or would not neccesarily know how to obtain them (women's studies was not yet a particularly large book market).

Both assertions are clearly absurd, but the nasty allegations continue. In the greatest of ironies, the &quot;pro-family&quot; &quot;pro-life&quot; relgious right will oppose this legislation because it supposedly interferes with their political activities.<br />I challenge anybody to read this book and then still believe the lies and distortions popularized by the right wing.Hate crimes are meant to stigmatize both the indiviuals affected and the larger marginalized group of which they are members of. Supporters of hate crimes laws are not well-heeled elitists, they are (quite litterally) the most vunerable members of society who fear for their lives.<br />Brenner describes how she and her lover were enjoying a wonderful day in the mountains when  the later was gunned down by a homophobic peeping tom. Although she survived and the physical injuries eventually healed, I could tell that it was still very emotionally hard for her. I applaud her for comming forward and retelling her story in the hopes that future generations of Americans will never have to personally experience the same fate.<br />Not supprisingly, Brenner became an anti-violence activist following this incident and has appeared before Congress urging passage of federal hate crimes measures. While her story did not recceive as much publicity as the later murder of Wyoming's Matthew Shepard, she helped personalize the face of hate crime victims.<br />Although it was her lover who was gunned down, Brenner realized that the day after that it could be somebody else's and the ugly pattern would continue until people of all sexualities started demanding an end to anti-gay violence and taught respect for different groups.	2001-03-08

After reading the thoughfull essays in this anthology, I came away even more convinced that I was right.<br />As depressing as some of the circumstances seem by todays standards, these women surmounted impossible odds, and for that, I am profoundly gratefull and only wish I could have been there to help out. Having been born in 1979, I cannot imagine how exhillarating this movement was.<br />From fighting to legalize abortion and contraceptive information, to the women's health movement to debates over sexuality and equal rights, the modern feminist movement (matched only by the civil rights movement for breadth and impact) has had the most imediate impact on American society.<br />The fact that most people (women and men) support these goals and take their victory for granted shows both how successful feminists have been in the battle, and how much we still need to do to preserve our ground while working on new areas.<br />Because women's history remains largely unsung in public schools, we need more books like this to educate (and hopefully) inspire the next generation of feminist activists.	2001-03-06

I used to love watching this show as a little girl and think it is rather unfortunate that today's youth is treated so shodily (it is assumed they will not understand unless they are really spoken down to) than previous generations.<br />Although there is some Elmo in here, he is not the prime focus and the readers can see the composite history of the show. I honestly believe this book is targeted for the generations of Americans who grew up with Sesame Street, remember it as an Elmo-free product, and want the youth of today to have those same memories.	2001-03-05

America underwent it's bicentential at a time when various left wing movements were still close enough in the national conciousness to charge those celebrations with a feeling of working for improvement. Somehow, I don't think the nation would have been as introspective earlier.<br />In keeping with the Magazine's focus, the book is largely focused on trends and events (in that order) but it is still a good tool for those who want a glimpse of what life was like during the &quot;Me decade&quot;.Winkler, the star of 70's megahit &quot;Happy Days&quot; provides a wonderful introduction to a book nobody, historian or otherwise should be without.	2001-03-05

(Girl Talk)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	The best book in a flimsy series	Although I originally got the girl talk series because I had the game, I quickly bored with the substandard writing and the paper thin plots.<br />Other than a brief mention and discussion of Title IX, and women's rights, there was very little to keep me glued to the rest of the series. I have perpetually found the telephone conversations throughout the book anoying and space wasting. There is nothing said in those conversations that could not be said outloud.<br />When I got older, I naturally gave the others away for charity, but kept this one because of the quasi-feminism in the book. Katie proves that gender is artifically constructed, it is hip for young girls to know their rights under federal law and non-conventional women can get the realy hot guy. Happily, this deviates from tradditional character structure for young adults.<br />Because so much of what I rememeber from Junior high said the popular girls were quiet, non-activist and tradditional, I really liked the ending. Like Katie, I was beining to discover my voice at the time, unlike her, I did not have as much personal popularity after using it.

Boxer and her daughter write a frank and enlightening journey of the path that modern political women have taken in the baby-boomer generation.<br />Born at a time when women were encouraged to be a Senator's wife, the women elected during the 1992 &quot;Year of the Woman&quot; were also influenced by the women's movement of the 1960's and 1970's. For the first time in history, women were told that they had a right to seek power in their own name and the above mentioned sense is growing stronger with each new generation.<br />While women went to Washington before 1992, there was an unspoken assumption they were not going to make waves, instead defering to their male colleagues. Perhaps most importanly, they would only mention women's issues if it was in the context of maintaining the status quo (ie help for homemakers) and did not work as directly for women's equality as would be expected today.<br />Although it is written by one Senator, the reader can really sense that it was a collaborative effort for all the women in the class of 1992. Even as we have reached higher numbers of women in office (with the election of Michigan's Debbie Stabenow, Missouri's Jean Carnahan and New York's Hillary Rodham Clinton) the journey will never be completed until society becomes more comfortable with independent women office holders.<br />Obviously very relevant to political women, this book is a good mentoring tool for women in all professions. Even though it is biased towards the next generation of liberal democrats, I also believe that conservatives will be able to draw some inspiration from this book as well. Women will continue to break down political inequalities making our legislative bodies more accurately reflect the population.	2001-03-02

From the tone of the writing, it is obvious the author actually knows what it is like to be a modern woman attending a college and this greatly helps her audience connection. She might not have all the answers, but her prose is so honest and straightforward.<br />Anybody who wants to know what they are in for during the first year of college from a litterary point of view needs to read and reread every one of these books in the series before packing up and heading to the dorms. Later on, I can guarantee you will look back at both the books and your own freshman year and marvel about your awesome &quot;anti-stress series&quot;.<br />Building on the &quot;alternative&quot; style that was popular during the series run (early 1990's) the school is located in the pacific northwest and really artsy and &quot;grungy&quot; people have lots of paragraph time and detail lavished on them. Although there are well heeled sorority people, this book is not built around them.	2001-03-01

Mishappen and grain photograps surrounding text sadly did not meet them.<br />Also problematic is the overemphasis on NOW. Because the book is called the &quot;Feminist Chronicles&quot;, I was expecting a broader portrait of second wave (and beyond) feminism.Considering Smeal and the other co-authors have worked at other feminist organizations and are currently involved with the Feminist Majority Foundation, I was not prepared for the tiresome over emphasis on NOW and it's politics.<br />As a third wave feminist, I would have liked to see more focus in the 1980's and 1990's on the riot grrrl movement and gen-x feminists and their organizations. Rename the series &quot;The NOW chronicles&quot; if you must, but if the title stays, expand it to include the efforts of all feminists.<br />Again, I suspect the cramped and rushed layout of the book also has something to do with the bad case of eyestrain readers may develop.<br />While I realize the promised delay of the 20th century compilation may be due to unforseen circumstances and problems, I also realize there is so much that has happened since 1993 that directly affects women. Whatever one may think of President Clinton's intentions on women's issues, we have seen a marked increase in attention given to feminist policy and this needs to be doccumented.<br />With just a few minor revisions in the layout and content departments, this would be a fantastic textbook or tool to chronicle the women's movement. The inclusion of NOW's founding doccuments and statements indicates very forward thinking and will doubtlesly be appreciated by historians who are in search of primary material.atements indicates very forward thinking and will doubtlesly be appreciated by historians who are in search of primary material.	2001-03-01

Having seen the original movie and then wondering where Pike went when the show debuted, I was pleased to pick up and read this book. Not only did it answer my questions, it also made me smile, cry and laugh.<br />Unlike the on screen romance with clueless TA/Army comando Riley Finn, the Buffy in this book is torn between two men who genuinely understand her calling and do not try to make light of it. Thus, Buffy's decision is really interesting (especially when we learn that Pike and Angel can actually stand to be around each other)<br />Sure, some people have panned the book, claiming that it deals too much with Giles and the relationship between his father, but in actuality, one can skip over those parts and not miss too much in the book. This book is an essential for all BTVS fans who want our heroine to actually be placed in an emotionally realistic love triangle.<br />Like many other Buffy fans, I believe this would be a wonderful script for a badly-needed second movie and should seriously be considered. Even if there are no specifics mentioned for the role of Pike, physical and character descriptions make it clear that Golden wants no other than Luke Perry (who was the original Pike) to reprise the role. Because his presence was ironically one of the reasons why I went to see the 1992 movie, I would certainly not have any problems with that.	2001-02-27

Although all of this was exposed in the now infamous witch hunt, the Republicans kept on plugging, happily oblivious to the actual desires of the American public<br />While there is no doubt what Clinton did was wrong, the American public realized that the best person to handle it was the president and his family. This was never on par with international espionage or other matters that would have actually warranted a constitutional crisis.	2001-02-25

In tune with the neccessity of colonial life (which was still hard)Felicity and her best friend Elizabeth Cole have a fairly high level of interaction with both female and male characters in the story.<br />Even though the importance of a peer group cannot be denied, it also suggests that much of the restrictions we have placed on gender were artificial because women were certainly a lot stronger than society was willing to admit again until the women's movement of the 1960's. Durring the story, she is featured running around town in the middle of the night, working and ridding bareback on her beloved horse.<br />On the otherhand, the book does celebrate uunconventional young women. As part of Virginia's merchant class, Felicity should be docile and quiet, but gleefully defies all odds of what a proper young woman should be.<br />While the book series is intended for Junior high audiences, I still enjoy reading them because of the increasing character depth. I usually do not like reading history before the 1950's, but this book was delightful and remains one of my favirotes.	2001-02-25

It explains how the dream for New York and Hillary was pulled off against insurmountable odds and how all the pundits were proven wrong.<br />From the time she announced her senate candidacy, to the time she was sworn in to office, Hillary confirmed for the still non-believers that she was a new and novel type of first lady who would expand the ways women are thought of by society. While only New Yorker's were elgible to vote for the first lady, she (much like long term Massachusetts's Ted Kennedy) carries a national coalition for the Democratic party.<br />Sure, Hillary has flaws (what human does not?) but they are not as fatal as several attack dogs of the right have been suggesting. Ironically, this relentless atack of Hillary for not being a &quot;real New Yorker&quot; (especially from Rick Lazio who made his weak standing worse with the mantra) may have made some voters sympathetic to her ideas because at least she was taking the possibility of representing New York seriously.<br />There have been other books written about Hillary ... but this book is an excellent chronicle of a key moment for American political women. Whether loved or hated, there is no denying Hillary's impact on American politics, therefore making this a lovely gift for the aspiring young female politician who desparately wants more legitmate grrl power role models than transparent pop-stars.	2001-02-21

I am unfortunately familar with her work, but this type of journalism seems better suited for high school or junior high.<br />In fact, a suprsing amount of bile stems from Noonan's dislike of Hillary's fashion sense and her constitutional right to run for office (I am happy that she won)Really, most educated people realize these are rather childish reasons to declare somebody a threat to the nation's best interests, and I strongly suspect Noonan knows this too.<br />Her ultimate attempt of course is to appeal to the angry and ignorant who cannot pinpoint why they dislike Hillary so much. Instead of at least attempting to explain policy differences, she knows it is easier to get people whipped up over the new political woman.	2001-02-15

Aside from a few notables like Margaret Chase Smith, Lynn Martin and Elizabeth Dole the Republicans do not have as many potential prospects and/or a high voter identification rate with other women.<br />Even though it is not explicitly a feminist polemic (ie they do not appear especially interested in examining things through women's studies tools and paradigms)both authors clearly want a moderate democratic woman running the country. Among those on the list are Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY)<br />Because the number of women who regularly vote in presidential elections has surpassed men since the mid 1980's, the presence of a woman candidate should not be taken for granted. The fact that politicians have increasingly moved post-cold war to traditionally &quot;female&quot; issues like education and children is not enough.<br />It is worth noting that Kennedy Townsend and  Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) both made Al Gore's potential list of vice presidential candidates. Although I was disappointed he did not chose either woman, the incident does prove the book's almost prophetic staying power.	2001-01-27

I came away impressed with the Human Rights movement on campus in the late 1960's and 1970's. These students brought about several appreciable changes in university policy and core curriculum which I and my classmates benefited from (no more curfew, liberalized dressing, acess to contraceptive information and resources, and the addition of women's and multicultural studies). It is to the credit of the studentsin that era that my generation--and others--is treated with respect.<br /><br />The book does have problems as it moved into the 1980's though. The University did not do all it could to continue attracting out of state students and traditional students--who are more likely to pay the most money and use the most campus resources.<br /><br />Content to rest on it's past laurels as THE place for a woman to obtain an education, the school did not know how to market itself competitively against now-open programs at formerly all-male and/or previously limited institutions. Consequently, the campus life and activites are rather sparse in this time period, and the book's tone also suffers because of it.<br /><br />Enrollment has finally climbed again, but the school lacks a mass communications program to doccument current events as they are happening. But we need to preserve the past so people know why this place IS worth attending.<br /><br />While I realize that the original author Joyce Thompson died, I would think it would raise TWU's image if the book were being updated. This new update should reflect the university centential celebration, movement into the digital age, and reorganizing and restructuring.<br /><br />Perhaps taking this book on recruitment tours will help keep the university enrollment up after a period of decline.  It is the closest thing we have to a yearbook.	2001-01-25

Yes, it is possible with this book.<br />En route to a show, the Boston 5 help a Native American reservation and use their star power to bring the plight of this group to their predominately Anglo target audience.<br />Although I intially bought it when I was in Junior High because Donnie had a staring role in this predictable adventure, some parts of this book are really incredible when it is understood that the New Kids were a very early and original version of the boy bands of today.  Yet, because the author's attempt does not create a modern day Billy Jack (where a peace activist provides shady justification for his use of violence while helping Native American children) it is far more interesting than it could have been.<br />Throughout most of the story, Donnie and the others act as mentors to the American Indian youth and learn about their friend's lives. Although the mentor plot is some what condescending in parts (after all, the book does not mention that Native Americans such as Lenoard Peltier and the American Indian Movement have long been at work on these issues) it also is a good attempt at trying to reach young minds.<br />While not at all known for writing political books, the authors are careful to avoid preaching to the target readers, and enough material is woven into the otherwise flimsy storyline to encourage children to think about others who may be different from themselves. Since the 1980's was filled with doomsday reports that 60's style activism was all but dead in the age of greed, this remained a nice suprise.<br />At the same time, there are moments where older readers (even those who grew up with NKOTB) will detect the saccharine plot and wish for something more substantial. Duh, of course the New Kids are going to help the less fortunate and help expand the conciousness of their fans.<br />Still, not bad for a pre-teen marketed group.

Mirande weaves both qualitative and quanitative analysis to examine how Hispanic and Latino men really act.<br />Too much of the mass media assumes that the lazy, super-macho, virulent and violent Hispanic man is the cultural norm rather than the exception. Mirande shows that subjugation has more often than not introduced those elements into this culture, rather than the other way around. Because family is very important in the Chicano culture, these men are more likely to spend time with their children than Anglo men.<br />Also interesting was the section on GLBT chicanos and how culture influences acceptance of sexuality. Despite the predominance of catholicism in Latino communities (which usually disapproves of homosexuality)evidence presented in the book suggests that their culture's concept of sexuality is more fluid than the anglo counterpart. Furthermore, the author notes the 'Top' male in lovemaking is generally accepted in society while the passive one is the only person who is not regarded as a real man.	2001-01-19

The ultimate result is a waste of printing material and time that would have been better used on any other public figure.<br />For all of the ranting about morals and intergrity, she apparently believes there is a conservative Republican exception to honesty and morals. Both have an extremely limited view of American intellegence if they believe the Governor actually wasd the brains behind the project that led to this book or that he is one of the great statesman of the new millenium.<br />Then of course is the question, why should the American public accept an adminstration that was selected under dubious circumstances and is already deluded with airs of grandeur. No getting a supreme court appointment to the presidency is not a sweeping message of change from the general public. It is doubtful Bush will be fondly remembered in the history books as a great leader.<br />It's obvious at least half of the words and information in this book is beyond his intellectual level, so she ought to come clean and admit that she was the one who worked on it all along in a futile attempt to endear him to the American people. The jig is offically up.	2001-01-18

From start to finish, this book provides a classic self-portrait of one of the most hypocritical and bizarre women of the 20th century.<br />Schlafly is vehemently against the ERA and feminism NOT because she wants to protect the traditional family or homemaker-wife but because she wants to retain her status as one of the few women who have become honorary men because of their power and viciousness. If more women were allowed to enter the legal field and career world, her accomplishments might be downgraded to average and she would become just one of the girls again.<br />Although the ERA might have failed, the women's movement is still going strong precisely because it was built on proactive, rather than reactive language and imagery. If not prepared for the worst, one is taken back by the sheer level of anger so detectable throughout this text. This is one very mean and paranoid person.<br />Perhaps most telling of her hatred towards women is her characterization of the women she is supposed to be leading. She considers women childlike, easily distracted and catty (although most women period do not have the luxury of dawdling at any point in their adult lives.)<br />Make no mistake about it, the state and local presidents of the Eagle Forum are instructed to do exactly what she says when she says. Therefore they have less freedom compared to their sisters in feminist organization when it comes to local public policy making initiatives from their organizations. This autocratic nature reduces and does not develop leadership among peers. So Schlafly is less of a leader---and more of the schoolyard bully who will take others candy unless you do exactly what she wants when she wants, The women she `leads' are scared of her, and the world which she  says will exist without `her presence'.<br /><br />But a leader would make things better for all women.<br /><br />Riddiculous as it seems, Schafley's book is an excellent resource for exposing the right's own lunacy and misogyny. The majority of Americans can take comfort in the fact that Schafley's attitudes towards women have not won substantial ground since the 1970's and even appear to be on the wane as more and more Americans realize she is irrelavant to the realities of many families.ully who will take others candy unless you do exactly what she wants when she wants, The women she `leads' are scared of her, and the world which she  says will exist without `her presence'.<br /><br />But a leader would make things better for all women.<br /><br />Riddiculous as it seems, Schafley's book is an excellent resource for exposing the right's own lunacy and misogyny.

In essence, his argument states that Playboy was the sole proprietor of twentieth century sexual revolution and everybody else (especially feminists) were working against the empire that was Playboy. Not only does this create a very paranoid persona, but it also makes for shoddy book writing. Therein lies the chief problem with this self-appointed text of cultural history.<br /><br />Despite the generalized title of the book, it is nothing more than an advertisement for the magagzine and a disappearing way of life. According to the author, the corporation is in decline because feminists imposed their agenda on society and worked to eliminate a market for beautiful and nubile young women. He argues that society would still be great if we could return to those carefree days of yonder.<br /><br />The advent of AIDS as well as expanded opportunities for young women mean that the aspiration to be a Playboy Bunny has lessened in the last 30 years. Again, the author is so wrapped up in recreating these lost days that he does not give criticial analysis to anything that would suggest Playboy's wane is a complex set of circumstances. This is dangerously immature in the field of history. While most of the country has evolved to some degree of respect for the women's movement (which explains why Phyllis Schafley is less visible) he persists in blaming women for much of what they did not start. It says a lot about this amature \\"pop historian\\" that he simplifies the protests and concerns of women's rights activists down to internalized jealuosy because they never did look as good as the bunnies. Perhaps his book would have been better if he had attempted to see what his opposition was at least attempting to say.<br /><br />Indivduals interested in a more objective but shorter account of the Playboy life ought to read or view Gloria Steinem's \\"A Bunny's Tale\\" or even the MTV history of sex and rock and roll would be better than this thinly veiled advertisement for the Playboy corporation.d advertisement for the Playboy corporation.	2001-01-18

More than anybody, Kennedy deserves credit for staving off Newt and Trent's assuault on America and working to expand existing civil rights statues.	2000-11-02

Portraying himself as a demigod, Dobson then has the audacity to scold his audience for bearing false witness.<br />If your family does not have the exact same values system as Dr Dobson's, why of course there is a flaw (in your family no less) That such unrealistic drivel could sell in today's world is indeed scary.<br />Prior to reading this book, I had the opportunity to read the author's personal testimony and appology for distorting and attacking the most important aspect of American society---justice for all. Although past and present indicate otherwise, Dobson actually believes that conservative Christians have been the most oppressed and maligned group in American History. It is to Alexander Moegerle's credit that he saw the light, stopped himself, and is now reaching out to others.<br />Granted, there is a growing number of books dedicated to exposing the right as the single biggest threat to America, but this book is one of the standouts. Years from now, when somebody wants to study the religious reich, they will almost certainly look to this book for a wealth of information on America's favirote media empire/con artist.	2000-10-09

Sexual McCarthyism would not be an overexaggerated way to describe all of the hypocricy and danger the GOP placed the constution and American people in during this period. McCarthy would be very proud his likeness still has a home among conservatives.<br />Without excusing the president's conduct, one can plainly see that Starr reacted in overkill to the incident. Having elected him twice, the American people knew about Clinton's womanizing and did not really care. We believed the best person to penalize him would be Hillary, and the state should stay out of personal matters. If the state could intrude into the private lives of the first family, what hope would there really be for the average citizens?<br />Convinently, the right only embraces big government when it can be used to investigate and prosecute political dissidents. How else to explain wht the president's penis is dicussed in graphic detail?<br />For all of the bellyaching about Clinton's connections and alleged political wrongdoings. the biggest source of political corruption in this era was Kenneth W. Starr and colleagues. My sympathies to anybody related to this  modern facist, we know you have suffered the most.	2000-10-03

Introspective, energetic and visionary, they remind both allies and GLBT people  although much has been accomplished, there is no shortage of public policy issues to focus their work on.  AIDS, securuty clearances, lesbian feminism and dual identity conflicts of GLBT people of color are issues that will not go away until we deal with them substantively.<br /> While I was famillar with some names...  I was introduced to several unsuing heroes and role models. My only regret is that the book tended to gloss over instaces where the movement was not doing as well as it could have been. I believe this would have made some of the anthology more coherent. There are gaps which take away from the individual policy papers.<br /> Even if I understood the National Gay Task Force eventually bevame the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force to disadvow sexism, other readers might not be aware of the reason for the name change. More information on the Romer vs. Evans decision (which invalidated Colorado's virulently homophobic Amendment Two), a real victory at a time when the Supreme Court has no shortage of conservatives. The authors simply assume that people know the important bits and pieces that give the riveting stories meaning and importance. Given their backgrounds, this tendency is both troubling and unusual, little is accomplished by preaching to the choir<br />Still, the format of this book means it can also be used as a college textbook on GLBT issues and theory. Thus it is important to consider the book's above mentioned flaws as a fair description rather than a deliberate pan. Flaws and all, this book is recomended for anybody who wants to know what the &quot;newest&quot; civil rights movement has and is doing to improve American society.	2000-09-29

I was glad I kept an open  mind, because this book easily surpased all of my content expectations.<br />West neither massacres nor coddles his subject, and I could actually  identify with some of Kennedy's emotions and struggles to define himself.  As a college student, I was very impressed that he was in the legislature  while finishing up his degree---no easy feat in a state of any size. His  personal health led him to identify with the disadvantaged and  disempowered.<br />Tracing his childhood and young adulthood, West shows  how the &quot;un-Kennedy&quot; Kennedy emerged to become the chair of the  DCCC. For a public figure, Kennedy has managed to keep his life  largely  private and scandal free. He does not engage in the life style that has  created headlines for so many other members of the family.<br />Although I  am more partial to his father's voting record, I respect the niche Kennedy  carved out on his own terms and was impressed with the many different  things he had accomplished. This book is especially inspirational for young  democratic politicians.	2000-09-05

Colorado and America: The Inside Story of Amendment 2	Books	1	6	11	N	N	Morally and Politically Misleading	This book is an affront to all Americans irespective of sexuality. The jacket's art mistakenly implies the reader will get a factually netural and  constitutionally accurate acount of Amendment two and Romer Vs Evans.<br />For starters, the author assumes that straights and GLBT people are  mutually exclusive groups, ignoring the fact that GLBT rights do not take  away anything from heterosexuals. As a former resident of Colorado, I was  deeply saddened when the Amendment was passed, but rejoyced at the Supreme  Court ruling.<br />The book repeats the riddiculous but lingering stereotype  that GLBT people are really well-heeled and thus do not need special  rights. In reality, the amendment removed equal acess of police protection  and anti-violence measures from GLBT people only.<br />A basic study of  American constitutional law and the 14th Amendment says the states and  localities can offer more protection than the National government, but not  less. In striking down the Amendment, the majority conservative Supreme  Court ruled that states may NOT hold referendum to revoke the equal  protection clause from entire groups of citizens based on a group  characteristic They reasoned that if Colorado's amendment was allowed to  stand, there would be nothing from prohibitng discrimination against the  disabled and or racial and religious minorites in a community.<br />This book  is a litteral waste of space and time unless prospective readers are  interested in seeing for themselves just how loopy the religious right  really is. For people who claim to respect the country and individual  rights, they obviously failed US Government classes.	2000-08-31

Although it has not been updated since, it demonstrates how far  we've come and what is the next step for women.  Uneven style and tone of  writing give this unquestionable realness not often found in more  contemporary feminist anthologies.<br />  To read this book is to  spiral back in time to a place where information on borth control was hard  to obtain, abortion was a back alley reality, equal pay for equal work was  never enforced, sexual harassment (which is not mentioned) rape and assault  were life's little dirty secrets, and title IX was not yet reality.<br />  If the text often seems frenzied and uncompromising, remember what all  they were up against. Sexism had been so entrenched, both laws and culture  needed to be chaged. Socialization plays a big part in sexism.<br />  Lest such derogatory attitudes be assigned to the domininant society, a  couple of groups in the counterculture are also faulted as well. These  unenlightened attitudes in SDS and SNCC often formed the impetus for the  women's liberation movement, although there was some genuine equality  between the sexes within various chapters.<br />  Unfortunately, this  was the exception to the rule. Groups that understood the evils of violence  and subordination made light of rape and assault when directed at women.The  advent of the pill meant women who did not want to sleep with their  comrades had severe hangups.<br />  The women's liberation movement was  instrumental (to a greater extent than early mainstream groups) in  identifying and naming sexual self determination and violence against  women.<br />  Those who have been previously versed in women's history  will find this a who's who book of second wave (the first, of course being  the suffragists, and the third being generation X) activists.  From Robin  Morgan amd to Alix Kates Schluman, Kate Millet, Mary Daly, Lindsey Van  Gelder, Marge Piercy and Eleanor Holmes Norton, there is an impressive list  of activists.  Excluding the deranged Valire Solanis (later  convicted of shooting Andy Warhol) most of the contributors are articulate,  intellegent and therefore inspiring. Since she did little to promote the  women's movement, one must question her inclusion in the anthology.  Certainly, it would have reinforced negative sterotypes about women who are  involved in the feminist movement, thereby reducing it to spectacle.<br />  Missing is Gloria Steinem who did not not enter national conciousness  until the advent of Ms magazine---although her New York oppion column  \\"After Black power,women's liberation\\" could have been included.  Steinem  also wrote one of the most riveting articles on Abortion law hearings  during 1969. Even though she would later be the target of much suspcion  among  many of these women, Steinem's role in the women's movement remains  undisputed. Ironically, Morgan would assume editorship of Ms magazine years  later<br />  Because the book has not been republished or reedited, it is  more for the committed activist and historian than newcommers.  Although  many of the breakthroughs for women have of course occured, references to  names, events and places no longer carry the same punch.

Until this point, I dod not realize how  complex and developed the women's movement had become by the 1970's. Being  born in 1979, I always assumed that feminism was perpetually around.<br />Since it's a safe bet there are more young people (and future  generations) who will also believe that way, this book should be required  reading for anybody who wants to learn how the women's movement really  impacted America. Unfortunately, women's histrpy is underrepresented in  public schools and we are paying dearly for the gap in knowllege.<br />My  only reservation about this book, is that there are no pictures of the  various protests and deomstrations in the 1960's and 1970's. Considering  feminism:the career was not really feasabile until the 1980's (monetary and  logistic reasons)it neverless would be inspiring to see women (and men)  changing the system with what they did have.

The story of this accomplished woman bears testament to the changes fought for and won by women in the second wave of feminsim, both in the state of Texas and in the Nation.<br />Prior to reading this book, I knew that Roe vs. Wade originated in Texas, but I never actually understood how much things changed for women of my generation. Both women and men alike will marvel at the antiquated norms Weddington faced as a young woman and how she ultimately overcame them. For all of the frustrations I presently voice about the status of women in the world, I am not at all certain I would have her personal courage when faced with such overwhelming sexism.<br />As a Texas state legislator, she was responsible for an equal credit act, a rape reform bill (co-sponsored with another new female representative named Kathryn Bailey) and the state's Equal Rights Amendment. To realize that one woman had accomplished all of this is simply amazing and inspiring.<br />Although there is not as much White House era musings as I would have prefered, the fact that she got in when few presidents of either party appointed large numbers of women is really signifigant. Not satified with her own personal triumph, she then worked to ensure that future generations would not have the same hardship. Working alongside Midge Constanoza, Weddington used her position to encourage more women to get involved in policymaking.<br />Also heartening is Weddington's inclusion of steps to protect reproductive choice at the book's end.Unlike some other books on reproductive rights, the message comes in loud and clear: Defend choice every day and without compromise. The battles may be long and weary, but the nation cannot afford to abandon the 30 year old (at least in spirit) promise of women's bodily autonomy.<br />Even though the original version of the book was released during the 1992 elections, it is a message that bears repeating in every presidential campaign.

Although the focus of this  chapter(as with other chapters) was never how the authors personally felt  about various issues and policy areas, reading this chapter alone would not  tell you that. Ironically in a chapter about discrimination and  stereotypes, there are plenty of generalizations.<br />Even though the  authors grasped the idea of African American equality, they remark that  &quot;The creation of a more favorable public perception of efforts to  alter the status of women is perhaps impede by the fact that the National  Organization for Women (NOW) is regarded by many as being outside the  American mainstream and dominated by extremists&quot;(371)The authors then  try and backpeddle by assuring readers that &quot;In general, most major  women's organizations do not take a negative stance against  men&quot;(372)The idea that the two verbatim quotes can actually be  included in a professional allegedly netural work is beoynd  disbelief.<br />Furthermore, the subsection on Disability is prefaced as  victims. It fails to acknowllege that each of these subgroups (like women  and African Americans) also had a role in their own respective struggles.<br />Key legislation and court cases concerning disabled children's right to  a free appropriate public education is omitted, and the authors snidely  reference &quot;claims of learning disabilities&quot;(378) Considering that  the authors are teaching at public institutions, one must wonder what  planet they have been living on for the past 20 years.<br />Gone completely  is a discussion of the Asian American and Chicano rights movement. Native  Americans and GLBT rights are squeezed in as an afterthought, which is  particularly ironic given the current very visible presence of that  movement.<br />I sympathize deeply with any student who has to read this  textbook and urge you to do further research when you get to Chapter 10.

I heard about his story through the 3-2-1 Contact special that first aired  and then read the book. Both presented a young boy who went through some  amazing odds and suceded in brining AIDS awareness to the national  conciousness.<br />The prose is simple and unscholarly, but this is the  beauty of the book, because Ryan was a real human being with real feelings  and frustrations. Although some language will ofend the sensitive, it  captures the importance of tolerance and education. In addition to fighting  the complications of hemophilia and AIDS, he also had to fight sheer  uneducation, and a weaker person would have crumbled a lot earlier.<br />Picked on because of his difference, Ryan was ultimately more saintly  than several hollier than thos fundamentalists who either condemed him or  patronized him. Although I am fortunate enough not to have hemophilia or  HIV/AIDS, I did see a lot of myself in him and needed the obligatory  tissues by my side as I read this compelling story.<br />In the years since,  Elton John has dedicated &quot;Candle in the Wind'  to many people and it  has lost some of it's bestowment awe, but I remain convinced that it  rightfully belongs to Ryan White. As for quotes, I believe Michael Jackson  said it best: &quot;Good bye Ryan White, you taught us how to stand and  fight&quot; People like this do not come a long every day.	2000-08-08

If she was perfectly willing to let citizens of  Calcutta have access to primitive facilities, why on earth would Mother  Theresa not feel like they were good enough for herself? Presumably, god  would still love her regardless of whether or not she got fancy hospital  care.<br />Granted, the allegations raised by this book are not pretty and are  guaranteed to inflame some readers, but it does provide important  information. Because it does not mention such discrepancies are the  standard practice for Catholic orders (indeed, an overwhelming majority are  very modern and believe all patients should have acess)it is Mother Theresa  who is the spirtual oddity.<br />While it is quite possible that she could  have planned her nomination for sainthood (Nuns are still human and subject  to the samre whims)I don't necessarily think she should be faulted for it.  Expecting complete selflessness is unrealistic of any person whether they  be lay or clergy.<br />One can disagree with Mother Theresa's position on  reproductive self-determination while seeing why she would have to make a  series of shrewd political moves. Mother Theresa problaly realized that  women DO face a harder journey to sainthood because of their gender and  that she WOULD have to have lots of ambition to pull it off. Only she will  have to answer whether or not those connections were ultimately the best  option.	2000-08-02

If one did not pay attention, the style of prose  made it sound like George W. Bush. Several times while reading this book, I  felt cheated and realized that there was more good public information than  Hillin was promoting.<br /><br />This book has the thickness and breadth of  selections in my mother's junior high school library, and considering it's  adult intended target audience, is deeply disturbing. Hillin needs  to go  back and make substaintial additions to this book in order to do his  subject justice.<br /><br />That a one time house member, senate member,  presidential candidate, vice presidential candidate and vice president  elect of any ideology (let alone one allegedly shared by the author) could  garner such shabby treatment is simply appaling and embarrassing. This book  is not recomended for anybody.	2000-08-02

While I had known Representative Gunderson was hardly one of Ginrich's drones, his independence impressed me in some cases.<br />Throughout the book, Gunderson and his partner are frank in exploring  the balancing act between being gay and Republican. It also makes no bones  about the dislike for former Representative Robert Dornan (who was  thankfuly replaced by Democrat Loretta Sanchez)Yet, at the same time Dornan  was responsible for Gunderson's outing, the congressional conservative  unwittingly freed his colleauge from a long standing dilema.<br />Myself  included, some allies and GLBT people might forget there are Gay  Republicans and they are just as deserving of equal rights as the more  typical members of the community. In a non-judgemental tone, this book  shows the skeptical reader just how difficult it can be to maintain those  two identies. Ultimately, honesty is the best policy.<br />In a day and age  when politicans from both sides of the aisle are caught up with imagery  instead of truth, reading this book is a thought provoking and humbiling  experience for any individual regardless of party or sexuality. Although I  might disagree with some of Gunderson's decisions, I at least know that he  has character depth.	2000-07-30

Even if it leaves out the  fact that Buffy is supposed to have burned down the gym, how on earth she  (post-revelation)went to Europe or her parents divorce, it is not as choppy  as the movie version.<br />Reading this book is not necessary, but strongly  recomended to understand the slayer's world. It's also worth noting in this  series that she lacks the all-important network of the slayerettes or  expansive research outlets and her only helper is a drifter.	2000-07-25

Since my predictions were made in half jest, even I could have not imagined the cavalcade of stupid comments and  smug answers.<br />For a party allegedly oppsed to government waste, Newt and  company were perfect poster boys. Between government shutdowns, airforce  one tantrums and partisan investigations, they did a pretty good job  wasting the tax payers money.<br />Rather than trying to salvage his  repuatation (what little there is)we get more of the same self-serving  garbage. Newt, apparently unaware that his fifteen minutes of fame expired  long ago, has again set himself up as a deranged messiah. One can gradually  ernvison his head expanding to scarier proportions in each chapter....I'm  glad I was not around to clean up the resulting mess.<br />Devout newtoids  will like this, but the majority of intellegent readers will not.	2000-07-23

Although not as polished as his later works, the rough edges only add to the obvious torment our dark protagonist feels.<br />Contending  with a bible-belt(?) mother and extremely evil classmates, it's a wonder  that Carrie did not snap eariler. Her life seems dismal until she realizes  that she has telekinetic powers that enable her to do the extraordinary.<br />Although the movie is low budget by today's standards (strings and wires  are visible if you know where to look) this book remains very enjoyable  because you can picture it happening any time. Even if it was intended to  deal with the angst felt by the baby boom generation (and quite possibly  the frustration women were feeling in narrowed roles)it remains relevant to  my generation as well.	2000-07-23

The  pink Triangles that I accepted so matter of factly on my drives into GLBT  meccas were symbols of exile.<br />This book is an invaluable resource to  anybody who wants to know the real story behind one of the most forgoten  groups of the holocaust. The brutal and degrading these men faced were  ignored by some of the GI's who came into the camp....they too considered  gays &quot;abnormal&quot; For years though, we pretended that we could  easily demarcate heros from the villans regarding treatment of people.<br />Even though America and other western industrialized nations do not face  that problem today, the text is a powerful reminder that we cannot let  hatred and predjudce conduct affairs of state. &quot;Never Again&quot;  reverberates loudly and passionately through out the pages; a box of  kleenex would make a good companion while reading this book.	2000-07-22

As a devout Brenda/Dylan fan, I really liked this book because it enables the reader to revisit the ideal teen tv couple 24-7 on their own time.<br />Their romance was a key theme in the 90210 empire for many years,  and if you were disappointed that this was later abandoned, this book will  bring back some membories. Those who did not watch have a chance to see  what made the sparks fly.<br />While comparatively dry compared to  romance novels, the plot lines have their warm romantic moments. As always,  pictures are included in the middle of the book, but (since the fashions  are now dated) as always, you can imagine &quot;the gang&quot; clothed in  contemporary numbers.	2000-07-16

Women who found  themselves pregnant had very limited options (there were no laws against  firing pregnant workers or dismissing students and child support payments  were very lax in enforcement by modern standards)and Jane sought to change  that system. The change is even more remarkable in light of the fact that  many of these women were college students like myself.<br />Because this book  is so well written, you can almost feel the excitement and terror as many  collective members were changing the system. Understandably, the use of  pseudonyms was a necesitity both then and now.<br />Even though we know that  abortion was legalized in Roe the mood is so well set in the book,  &quot;Never Again&quot; rings throughout the pages. Although Jane members  do not regret what they did, it is obvious that they do not want another  generation to resort to such extra-legal methods. One generation was once  too many.<br />In addition to individual reading and research, this book  might be useful for a course on American women's history and/or a general  course in the 1960's-1970s.	2000-07-16

Based on my own previous personal experience, this is the  wrong way for anybody to go about organizing for social justice. If the  idea is to bring in people who did not know how they could make a  difference for themselves, their families and/or friends, this book needs  heavy revision<br />Understanding most of the interconnectedness of both  oppression and liberation, she forgets that smaller communities do not  neccessarily have the same access to resources and people power that urban  enclaves might. It is harder for GLBT people and their friends to organize  in the ways Vaid would prefer, but that does not neccessarily mean it is  impossible.<br />Vaid also fails to acknowllege that some people just don't  have the passion for political activity. She might (considering there are  groups and individuals debating GLBT's very right to exist) have every  reason to be angry, hurt or concerned about their lack of participation,  but people have to come to social justice movements of their own accord.  Coercing them to take a step they are not ready to do yet does not help  anybody or any movement.	2000-07-16

Even while ommiting some of the more lurid details of America's most famous family, we are treated to the all too fammilar headline scandals.<br />The idea that somebody rehashed them into a book and actually got it  published does lend credibility to the notion that our society is very  voyeristic and too addicted to trash. We've heard about the William Kennedy  Smith rape trial and aquittal ad nauseum now, and problaly don't need to  have it repeated 8 billion times.<br />This is not the book for people who  are in pursuit of a balanced and compassionate portait of the younger  Kennedys.Please don't waste your time and money on it.	2000-07-16

Even though they are not squeaky clean,  these young adults try to do the right thing.<br />Personal bias meant that  I liked Dylan's and Brenda's futures the best, although the other stories  are tolerable. Because this storyline was not carried over into the small  screen, it is still very interesting reading. No matter how many times, I  read this one, I discover all kinds of new twists and turns that had been  previously overlooked.<br />Obviously, the script writers must have given  permission for Gilden to use their characters, but then delved very far  from that plot on the small screen. It's really a shame too, because I  strongly suspect this could have sustained the show's ratings for a longer  period.<br />Since it appears to be an &quot;alternate&quot; ending for the  show, it would have been interesting to see what the chances of it's sucess  would have been if the casting had remained intact and the show had run for  more than 10 years. Brenda and Dylan would end up together after she became  a world famous actress...etc<br />Much more than the numerous Fox specials, I  think that this was the best tribute (and it was issued way eariler) to BH  90210. Even though it's hard for me to be objective owning the whole  series, people who (for whatever reason) can only afford/and or find one  novelization should get this one.	2000-07-16

Although there  are some pictures included, another hidden benifit is the ability to update  the characters wardrobe.<br />As with the orginal, Luke Perry is not in the  book, but this is a small price to pay because the writing (while not  groundbreaking) is good enough to let people visualize what is unfolding.	2000-07-16

Although the characters had family problems beneath a life of privllege or (in the Walsh case) were symbolic of the viewing audience  who were the all knowing outsiders selectively accepting and discarding  portions of &quot;the&quot; life, it was a fabulous show.<br />Ten years  later after it's inital debut, 90210 went off the airwaves.

Like any good  TV/Movie novelization, it also explands on the show by bringing in thoughts  that were not present to the viewing audience. The result is a TV tie in  that belongs in every true Charmed fan's library.	2000-07-15

Following assasinations and tabloid headlines, the men were subsequently were criticized for fast living and political  decisions.<br />The women, once ideal images of feminity became scorned for  being the &quot;ideal helpmate&quot;. For years, the press did not want to  cover the women in anything other than fashion and family. Although Jackie  despised the &quot;little wife&quot; role, she nonetheless went with it for  the sake of election.<br />This book does a good job reconcilling the two  methods of examination. For the first time, we get a well rounded picture  of America's most famous family as seen through the eyes of women. Thanks  to the separate spheres approach that prevailed until the late 20th  century. If JFK's sisters were political, it was under the non-threating  guise of community service and volunteer work.<br />Although Rose Kennedy was  considered a tradditional matriarch, no other book had touched her  subconcious desire to enter into politics or her intial revulsion of Joe  Sr's womanizing. Thus, the dislike of Jackie (many people did not realize  how much policy making influence she had) becomes all of the more ironic.<br />Younger generations of Kennedy women such as Kathleen Kennedy Townsend  have also continued this tradition, but have sought (and won) elected  office in their own right.  RFK's youngest daughter, Rory, is an avowed  feminist activist.  This book would be of interest to anybody studying  political dynastys and or the Kennedy family in particular. Because it  balances the positives and negatives of it's focus, the book is well  balanced and easy to read. Be warry of imitators because this is the  definitive work.	2000-07-15

But that and this book introduced us to Buffy and her destiny.     I first received this book in 1994 (long after I saw the movie) and was really psyched to hear there would be a TV show (and more opportunites) for books.     Anybody who wants to be introducted to the  Buffy series still should start at this book.     Although both it and the  screen play list her as a Senior (when the TV series debuted, she was a  sophomore) it is still worth the purchase.  I still read the book to this day  and the plot's attraction remains strong.	2000-07-14

While (being born in 1979) I was fortunate to have  been raised without narrow gender roles, I can see where such socialization  would have set previous generations up. My mother (who was an oddity  because both her parents worked) does not conciously identify herself as  feminist, but says this book strenghthened her independence.<br />Most of the  facts, statistics and tables are obviously outdated (and therefore unusable  to support current discrimination) but there are sections of the book which  should be able to carry over into the 21st century. It is worth noting that  with the exception of Simmone Beavior's Second Sex, there were few books at  the time calling for women to be treated like human beings and equals.<br />Comparatively devoid of &quot;controversial&quot; issues (like GLBT  rights) compared to other books, this gave Friedan the leeway needed to get  her admittedly radical writting out to a larger audience. Friedan's status  as a suburban middle class wife (despite her radical past with labor  unionizing)gave her the protective covering necessary to raise this very  important issue.<br />Even as I personally favor Gloria Steinem (who also  understood that women's rights were interconnected with that of other  oppressed groups) I found a lot to admire in this book. Friedan was clearly  ahead of herself on this one, and problaly was unpreppared for the wave of  positive (and some newgative) responses that followed the orginal  publication of this book.	2000-07-12

I really  think my friends and I could have used this book as an inspirational tool.<br />Although  I still can occasionally get discouraged with the rather slow  pace of GLBT equality, this book reminded me that my friends could have  lived in a much more hostile climate, and that I and my parents and  straight friends are not the only ones concerned about injustice  perpetuated in the name of &quot;family values&quot;<br />I was also  impressed with how many of the people I knew from conversation and/or  newspaper headlines. If there was any proof that GLBT issues are becomming  mainstreamed into society, this was definently it. Contributors include  some of the headliners in the past 10 years from safe schools, to marriage  and scouting.<br />What prevented the book from being redundant was the fact  that each of the stories were presented in (at least for me) unprecedented  depth. I really got a good sense of what these people were feeling from  outrage to defiance and justice.<br />Varying in sex, race, age and  geographical background, each contributor has an important goal. Even North  Carolina, home to the infamous Jesse Helms, is not imumne from diversity  organizing. Simmilarly, neither is an avowedly &quot;liberal&quot; Texas  private school when one teacher realizes even that place contains  homophobia.<br />Knowing news outlets (including the sympatheic ones) have to  use soundbites and abreviated stories because of space contraints, I really  appreciated the hollistic portrayal of each of the individuals. I really  got a good sense of how much they had to endure (and still do in some  cases) to remind the world that it really is not us vs. them.	2000-07-12

Although I was a Clinton Loyalist inspite of White House problems, I never imagined Mr. Starr would have taken the investigation to the heights  he did.  Somewhere along the line. the independent prosecutor decided that  he was above the law.<br />Although not as hefty as several of the other  books doccumenting the Clinton Inqusition, Carvile provides a basic summary  of the real story and congressional overreaction to it.  Yes, Clinton has  problems, but seeing as how hidden extramartial affairs crossed party  lines, this was never something that was supposed to be investigated.<br />When I bought this book amidst impachment hearings, I genuinely did not  know if congress was going to remember the will of the people. Each day of  coverage seemed more twisted and horrific than the next.  Reading this book  really helped me through those times and I would highly recomend it to  anybody who was interested in getting the bare facts about sexual  McCarthyism.<br /> May future generations grow up without personally  experiencing the near tragedy I witnessed.	2000-07-12

Some of the contributors are already infamous, others are starting out, but they are connected by an unyielding spirit of  equality and justice. <br />The seriousness of the message is lightned up by  antecedotes. While this is uncessary for seasoned activists, it is a  practical method to draw potential allies in. GLBT rights remains a  controversial subject despite progress and the open minded majority need to  break the ice and show newcomers that it is not &quot;their&quot; problem  alone.   <br />Although I am a seasoned activist who had already read on gay  and lesbian studies, I appreciated that there was a professional anthology  for people like me. This book is a direct rebuttal to the Christian Reich  that support for GLBT rights is incompatable with heterosexuality.<br />Each  of the speakers is clear headed, articulate and compassionate. Because the  above traits have been used by discriminatory forces, it was refreshing to  see them applied in a sensible context.	2000-07-11
2382188:US	50015891	R25E5QCHG663GR	0874778115	4607817	Run Run Run: The Lives of Abbie Hoffman	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Compassionate last portrait	Although I prided myself on being leftwing, I thought I understood everything there was to know about Abbie Hoffman. The final tribute by his brother is sympathetic without covering or making excuses for less than  stellar behavior with various drugs.<br />Intially starting out as a clean  cut middle class psychologist, Abbie Hoffman gradually morphed into one of  the most recognizable revolutionaries in America during the 1960's and  1970's. This noteriety also placed him on the FBI's most wanted list, in  court following the 1968 Democratic National Convention and eventually  undeground in Mexico to evade a drug bust.<br />Although he was certainly  eccentric (a string of marriages and divorces)and a proponent of free love,  he also came across as an average guy who worried about his kids, liked  sports and remembered his roots. In turn, his family stuck by him even when  it was not easy to be related to Abbie.<br />I was also struck by how  depressed Abbie felt when younger generations did not want to take on the  system so vigorously. For somebody who prided himself on being hip and with  it,realizing that young adults of the 1980s did not share his same moral  righteousness must have been worse than fear of aprehension by the FBI  and/or CIA.<br />It is this state that Hoffman spent his final years. Although  he still organized, it was apparent the 60's were long over. Nonetheless,  he was optimistic that Michael Dukakis would become president in 1988.<br />Although this dream did not become realized, it is interesting to  theorize what kind of reaction he would have had to Clinton's election.<br />Even if this book is intended to be a personal tribute to another family  member, it convinced me more than ever that, if the world is more  democratic and open minded since the 1960's,Abbie Hoffman, (among others)  deserves the credit for this victory.I do not remember Hoffman's death,but  am certain that he will remain deeply missed by many of those who did.	2000-07-08

But Congressman Lewis does not reveal it in his autobiography about  participation in the civil rights movement. What we get instead is a brave  highly motivated young man who put his belief into a free and equal society  into action.;<br />Lewis, who is currently one of the few southern democrats  in congress has a record of defending the civil rights of all groups.  Although I had always admired his voting record, reading about the seeds of  activisim was very moving and touching.<br />Braving arrests, poliice  brutality, political apathy and confusion, Lewis and his friends were early  disciples of Martin Luther King. Also interesting is the uncanny habit of  rubbing shoulders with John and Robert Kennedy. Although revisionist  history has cast some doubt on the actual motives of the civil rights  position, Lewis fondly remembers both as American heroes.<br />According to  Lewis, both men were genuinely anti-racist, but were unpreppared to deal  with dixiecrat resistance to intergration or the actual sight of  segregation. Indeed,many readers such as myself still find the conditions  under which Affrican Americans were expected to exist horifying.<br />Although  many books and memoirs have been written about the civil rights movement,  Lewis attaches unparralleled grace. One can almost hear the representative  personally narrating the epic journey himself.	2000-07-08
2387141:US	50015891	RTVGS6FKKH5VF	1559722665	924819193	A Woman Named Jackie: An Intimate Biography of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Interesting and Provocative	I picked up this book as part of a research project. I did not realize just how rounded a person Jackie really was. Prior to this point, I thought she comformed to all of the ideal notions about the pre-feminist woman.  Boy was I mistaken<br />Amist all of the controvery about Hillary Rodham  Clinton and her role in thbe adminstration,  it is important to remember  that Jackie also played an important policy role. Unlike several of her  sisters in law, she was more insistent about getting to the all male  sanctum of policy making. The whitehouse renovation was only ythe most  public of Jackie's involvement.<br />I personally think she would have been  happier and had less contradictions if she were of a later generation and  did not have to &quot;look&quot; the part of the fawning wife (then  prefered by the media) She seemed bored by the press conferences that soley  wanted to focus on family and fashion and really would have been a dyamo in  the office today.<br />It is difficult to say what JFK might have done had  the limosune been domed, but it appears as if they might have settled down  together and enjoyed life.  For the first time, we really understood why  she was so upset that November. She and her husband were actually falling  in love with each other when tragedy tore them appart.  This chapters is  written so well, I cried reading it.<br />I  was also impressed with how she  raised her children. The tabloids are littered with the stories of famous  children, to Jackie's credit, she insistilled an unbreakable moral compass  that kept them from intentionally self destructing. Not many parents,  public or private can claim that  accheivement.	2000-07-05

Every thing they had taught me about justice and fairness to people in  general was supported by this book.<br />GLBT rights is not gay vs. straight  or non-religious vs religion. It is equality vs. misinformation and  intolerance. The world would be a much safer place for my friends if  everybody read this book and took it's important moral lessons to hear	2000-07-04

Too many of the Nirvana and.or Kurt Cobain books out on the market should be used as  toliet paper, so I was really pleaserd to read this one.<br />I really felt  for Kurt and Courtney through all of the legal procedings and got the  impression that they were  just like many other couples--excluding the rich  rock star thing.<br /> One other thing that jumps out, is the frequent  and  loud denunciation of anybody who is racist, sexist and/or homophobic.  Few  of the current big name bands inspired by Nirvana can claim such exemplarly  conduct.  Ditto for the modesty and admittance of imperfections and flaws.	2000-07-03

There was a vast right wing conspiracy out to undermine the Presidency and ultimately destroy America.<br />In painstaking details, the authors trace  the anti-Clinton sentiment back to Arkansas and racial prejudice. Because  he supported the civil rights movement, the old south disliked Clinton and  sought to destroy him.<br />Now that our national nightmare is over and Starr  and Tripp are exposed as the real threats to national security, this book  serves as the most comprehensive chronicles of what happens if the GOP is  allowed to control congress. For a party that allegedly supports fiscal  conservatism, they sure had no problem wasting the taxpayers money on a  groundless and partisan investigation.<br />Although the reading can get  complicated and depressing at times, it also reaffirms human potential. The  mass demonstrations and rallies against impeachment and removal from office  ultimately confirmed that the much-written about apathy of the American  public can be shaken.<br />We could have just let congress, Starr and Tripp  trample over our wishes, but we fought back and will continue at the ballot  box this November. It is my fondest hope that the experiences and emotions  in this book will never be experienced by future generations.	2000-07-02
2417846:US	50015891	R28CP2TBTYM40S	0684807890	238885255	Life So Far: A Memoir	Books	1	11	22	N	N	Deluded	Friedan might have been the first president of NOW, but she never fully grasped that sisterhood actually meant that women had to work together with each other and sometimes she would not be in the limelight.<br />Although I am  very sorry to hear she was beaten by her husband all of these years and  went through a messy divorce, this does not excuse her bizzare and  obsessive behavior towards Gloria Steinem and other feminists. THe fact  that Friedan maintains that Steinem &quot;just wanted to disappear me&quot;  suggests just how narrow minded and self centered Friedan really is.<br />This book might be good for entertainment or a study of people with  mental problems, but by no means should it be mistaken for a feminist tome  or action plan. The eloquent research of the feminine mystique has been  replaced with a heaping pile of paranoid garbage.	2000-06-18

I was delighted to pick up this book and read the first (and probaly most accurate)book on such a revolutionary leader.<br />Denounced by the extreme right and extreme left, Steinem's life has  taken her from Ohio to Massachusetts to India, Washington DC and NY. Having  cofounded Ms. the National Women's Political Caucus, the Women's Action  Alliance and Voters for Choice, Steinem is truly an example of a good role  model.<br />Heilbrum's superb prose takes us into the infamous resentment  born by Betty Friedan and Kathie Sarahchild. Although both of these women  are famous in their own right, their inexcusable and childish tantrums  undid their own feminist reputation without any help from Steinem. Also  deserving of their repuation is Betty Harris who's paranoid delusions and  lax work ethic jepordaized the working environment at the early MS. Steinem  is a saint for having dealt with these crazies and still keeping cool.	2000-06-18

Although I'm certain there are simmilar books out on the market, this was the one that I first picked up. Prior to this time, I had been looking at home planning  magazines in a vain attempt for needed inspiration. Even if you do not own  a home or are planning in the near future, this book is too good to pass  up.	2000-06-17

Although the book does contain some factual errors, overall it is nicely written and well researched. Love him or hate him, the senior senator from Massachusetts HAS and CONTINUES to wield signifigant influence over  domestic and international affairs.<br />At this point, Kennedy wields more  self earned power and influence than anybody could have imagined when he  used to be compared to Jack and Bobby. Kennedy would not be as influential  as a president.	2000-06-15

I recieved this book as a gift when it first came out and still refer to it. Although I have since read many other feminist books, this text was one of the first to publically acknowllege that third wave feminists (including myself) necessarily have some differing ideas--which need to be listened to for the movement's ongoing relevancy.<br /><br />Nommy Lamm's essay on intersecting disability identity with feminism really spoke to my own experiences. I have discovered that even some feminist colleagues will look down on me after realizing that I am a person with a disability. Alternately, some people with disabilities are not interested in a feminist critique of the state and thus do not consider themselves part of  this social movement.<br /><br />However important the disability rights movement of the 1970's---overemphasis on their acchievements ignores the perspective our generation has precisely as a result of growing up with non-discrimination laws AND lingering discrimination. At the same time, I do have privllege because my own disabilities are generally hidden---and I can 'pass' for the so-called normal person.<br /><br />Indispensible and thought provoking essays from various backgrounds show how women do feminism gen-x style. A definite solace to those of us remaining unconvinced of the Spice Girl's \\"Girl Power\\" mantra.	2000-06-15
