Well, Dayton Duncan spent a couple of years visiting those American counties that still meet the definition of frontier -- less than two people per square mile.<br /><br />In Miles From Nowhere, Duncan sheds light on what it means to live alone, really alone, no neighbors in sight or in small communities where there is no \\"next town over.\\"  There are quite a few counties in the mid-west and far west that meet the Census Bureau definition and the author provides an excellent sampling of what makes people stay or in some case move here.<br /><br />The place stories are sometimes fascinating and also interesting.  One area of Nevada was the fallout zone for early nuclear tests -- chosen because it was almost empty.  Duncan explores some of the people who lived under where the white ash fell and explores their continuing health problems as well as their exasperation with an unresponsive government.<br /><br />In Montana, there are still one-room schools where teachers live in trailers at the school site and teach one to ten kids from an attendance area measured in the hundreds or thousands of square miles.  There are people in the mountains of Washington and Oregon who pack their cars with a week's worth of provisions in case they break down because that's how long it could take someone else to happen upon their stalled vehicle.  And in Love County Texas, a county with under 1,000 people, the local elections are decided by feuds and family grudges that separate people into warring camps for elected offices which hold no real power and have no real money to spend.<br /><br />I found a peak into these lives and stories fascinating and couldn't put the book down.  Duncan has a way of getting these folks to open up and treats them matter-of-factly in a manner which allows the stories to speak for themselves.<br /><br />This is a very interesting book that opens up a part of America that almost all of the rest of us will only ever drive through while considering it empty.  Its not all empty, in valleys and nooks and up miles of dirt trails and in other hide-a-ways live some of us who are Miles From Nowhere and live a life the rest of us would have a difficult time enduring.ly ever drive through while considering it empty.

My seven year old, who has been into a real Mt. Everest phase for about six months, loves it.<br /><br />In a few pages, this book clearly tells about climbing the earth's highest peak, provides a lot of really interesting factoids about Mt. Everest, maps the way up the mountain and displays some of the equipment high mountain climbers must carry.  The reader will also learn about how mountains are formed, a bit about the Sherpas and their reverence for the mountain and many other interesting things.<br /><br />Both my son and I have enjoyed this very much.  It is a good basic book for kids who have learned to read and are moving to more challenging subjects.  That this subject is interesting as well is a plus.<br /><br />I couldn't decide if I liked the illustrations or not.  No photos, just Eric Carle-style cut-outs (but much more realistic and finely detailed than Carle's work).  The illustrations work well and are detailed, but I would have enjoyed a couple of photographs of the mountain.	2005-09-19

By taking a \\"friend's eye\\" view of our sixteenth President, Donald peels back some of the mystery surrounding this very private and guarded man.  Some, but not all.  As Donald demonstrates, Lincoln was unusually adept of shielding much of his inner self even from most of his close associates.  Whether by insecurity at his humble origins and self-taught manner or, (as I am more prone to think), by the design of a very focused ambition which was early on and constantly navigating his life's journey, Lincoln only let those he knew intimately get so close.<br /><br />The friends (some early life companions, young adulthood companion Joshua Speed, law partner William Herndon, some-time political ally Orville Browning, rival and then acolyte Secretary of State William Seward, and private secretaries John Hay and John Nicolay), give portrayal of Lincoln at every stage of his life.  Most give testimony to Lincoln's ultimate reserve, but all have insights, shared thoughts and anecdotes that provide a great depth of understanding at what formed the man and to some extent what made him tick.<br /><br />Although Donald has a minor psychological theme of motherless-children (Lincoln's mother died at an early age; he benefited from a loving step-mother who he gave great credit to), and the nature of friendships running through the book, most of this is good, solid history.  I personally thought the psychological stream could have been left out of this book, but it only occasionally intrudes and never surfaces enough to dominate any chapter of Lincoln's life.<br /><br />It is instructive to view Lincoln through the lens of those who know Lincoln best, particularly those who knew Lincoln before he was great.  Donald has added another valuable work on this most significant and interesting of Americans.	2005-09-11

The style of writing reflects Shelby Foote's great literary efforts in his Civil War trilogy much more than the detailed military descriptions found in works by Sears or Trudeau.  Although I thought it could have benefited from marrying this deeply anecdotal history more thoroughly with reportage of units and battles (as Foote did masterfully), I highly recommend this work for anyone interested in the final defeat of the forces of Robert E. Lee.<br /><br />The drama of the close of the Civil War's main theater is well told.  Readers are in the trenches with private Rebels and Yankees, as well as riding along with officers as they struggle to control events with limited information in a very fluid environment.  Although the author has a slight southern bias (I would say most reflected in his canonization of Lee and in showing Lincoln largely through his humorous stories or jokes), on the whole both sides are well represented and the superb strategic vision and masterfully calm control of Grant is amply demonstrated.  It was interesting to note that in the early chapters (each chapter is one of the final nine days of the campaign), the subheading for the Confederates is listed \\"Confederates\\" while the Union section is titled \\"The Enemy.\\"  I chalked this up to it being a book written in 1959 by a southerner and it really doesn't cloud what is a fairly even handed look at this fascinating military history.<br /><br />Using some literary license, mostly to flesh out descriptive scenery around first person accounts, Davis's effort reads like a \\"page-turner\\" novel as the ANV is pushed back from its entrenchments around Petersburg and Richmond, through flight and disintegration to its famous end at the McLean House.  It does end abruptly and it would have been fascinating to read more of the few days after the surrender when soldiers fraternized and the rebels walked home as American citizens once more.  I've often wandered what some of those long and lonely walks back to Texas, Georgia and other points far away from Virginia were like for the southern soldiers.  However, the author does an excellent job of giving the human side to the war, particularly in giving the major players a well defined personality.

Trudeau gives description to the very many major battles that encompassed Grant's attempts to first break through Lee's stout defensive lines then string the Confederates thinly by forcing them to extend to their right to cover remaining rail lines.<br /><br />This is an excellent book which covers the strategy, battles, siege warfare, life in the trenches and civilian existence during the 290 plus day siege (the longest siege of any American city).  Anyone familiar with Trudeau's more recent Gettysburg, will appreciate the author's enlivenment of the big picture with contemporary observations by participants of all ranks.  Many fascinating details of the siege emerge in this telling such as the City Point sabotage, the Great Beef Raid, as well as the more familiar Grant's stolen march across the James,  Battle of the Crater, and breakthrough following Five Forks.<br /><br />The only curiosity is that the author did not treat Five Forks and Dinwiddie Courthouse in detail, treating them as out-of-theater events like the capture of Atlanta and Thomas' victories over Hood.  My only guess is that as they were fought under Sheridan -- recently from the Shenandoah - the author considered these not part and parcel of the Petersburg Campaign.  I think the historical record differs from that assumption, but it does not take away from an altogether fine book.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the quibbles about lack of detail on some of the maps.  While not true for every beginning of chapter map, there were a few which did not contain enough detail to allow them to be easily followed.  On the other hand, he does have maps for every major engagement plus a good overall map showing all of the fortifications along each side's lines.<br /><br />Any Civil War enthusiast looking for a very good treatment of the Siege of Petersburg will be well satisfied with this book.de's lines.<br /><br />Any Civil War enthusiast looking for a very good treatment of the Siege of Petersburg will be well satisfied with this book.	2005-09-06

Polk (American Presidency Series)	Books	4	13	13	N	Y	Polk's Presidency Story  Told Well	There are too few treatments of one of America's most significant presidencies, that of James Knox Polk.  A friend asked \\"what was the deal about Polk\\" while I was reading the book.  The answer is:  \\"well, do you like the American Southwest and Washington state?\\"  Polk was responsible for both being gained for our country in their present forms.<br /><br />Bergeron's book is a good academic telling of this most significant of times.  Arranged by major topic, his biography covers the crisis with Mexico and the war; the crisis with Great Britain over setting the boundary of the Pacific Northwest; the cabinet members Polk chose and worked with (significant because at the time the precedent was for presidents to govern with and through their cabinets; giving secretaries much greater veto power over issues in their sphere than now exists), his relationship with Congress and his emergence as a politician.<br /><br />Polk's fascinating political personae as well as the personalities he had to deal with are well described.  Particularly on the Texas question, the war with Mexico and the negotiations with Great Britain, the reader is given a very good step-by-step picture of the cabinet debates and perspectives surrounding the president's eventual courses of action.  I came away feeling the author had researched the topics thoroughly enough to present a fairly complete picture of all three crises; allowing the reader an enjoyable bird's-eye view as the action unfolded.  The details of life as a mid-1800's American president are also told.  It is hard to imagine in this day and age a president holding twice weekly office hours for any person to visit with their problem (or more often request for office) or cabinet meetings in an age where secretaries had to be dealt with as their own political forces through wooing, placating and managing.  In these details, Bergeron helps to paint a presidency that has disappeared but also an environment that exerted strong influences on the way a president executed his office.<br /><br />This is very much a political-presidential biography.  Although a chapter does try to capture his essence as a man, the focus is squarely on the pivotal four years in which he came to epitomize manifest destiny and draw our map to something that would be easily recognized by today's Americans.<br /><br />The work is told in somewhat of an academic style.  For a student of history and politics, it is a fascinating story.  One gains a sense of the issues Polk confronted as well as the issues he helped create and successfully dealt with.

Jungle takes Middleton to deepest, darkest Africa on a hike with pygmy people through dense jungle.  Sand sees Middleton crossing the Sahara Desert with an all-female camel caravan in pursuit of trade and water.  Finally, in swamp, the author canoes into remote Papua, a south-sea island barely above sea level to determine if fresh water crocodiles inhabit the land.<br /><br />This is a good book that teaches as well as entertains. Middleton makes sure to tell about Greenland's history, the interactions of various Congo tribal groups, missionary work among the Papua tribes and social relations in the desert.  Along the way he eats his share of termites, participates in a Tubu tribe dating ritual involving body paint and preening for the unattached ladies and helps build habitable land in the swamp with a machete and sea grass.<br /><br />The book entertains as well as informs.

Climbing Everest is not discussed until pretty far into the book and then only for a portion of its pages.<br /><br />That is not to say this is a bad book.  The book features the usual compelling DK graphics on mountain formation, life in the mountains, mountain rescues and mountaineering as a generic topic.  It does a pretty good job on these.

The plot lines are exciting and linked to real problems/nemeses in the world.  I do think the author is somewhat repetitive in having various characters brood and then re-brood over the past slights that have brought them to whichever evil role they are destined to play in the book.  As another critic wrote, this story would have been well served by some editing and page reduction.<br /><br />All in all, a good freshman effort from an author who looks like he could carve out a niche for himself in the contemporary thriller genre.	2005-03-08

This non-fiction work (the title refers to the code Mafiosi used to inquire whether someone did hits -- the blood spatter being the paint) detailing the life of Frank Sheeran and his buddy Jimmy Hoffa is first rate.<br /><br />Brandt combines passages of Sheeran's own words with the author's background and fill-in's to tie together an impressive mob memoir.  Frank Sheeran, besides hailing for a time from my own Wilmington, Delaware, was one vicious and disciplined mobster. This is his story.  His hardscrabble life (his father would make him fight people in bars as a teen for beer -- the beer going to his father, not Frank) perhaps made a life a amorality unsurprising.  What is amazing is that this recount by an old man facing death is not a repentance for a life lived horribly wrong, but a simple detailing of the events of that life.  The banality of Sheeran describing his career -- hits, butchering, beatings told the way an accountant would detail audits or financial statement presentations --  is fascinating and speaks to a man wholly absorbed in doing his part for organized crime and the Teamsters.<br /><br />Hoffa is presented as an interesting figure; one who starts using the mob for the benefit of \\"his\\" teamsters but makes the tragic mistake of believing he is too big to be bound by mob rules.  His story and will to take over what was once the most powerful union in America is a remarkable tale in its own right and told interestingly in this book.<br /><br />Sheeran idolizes Hoffa.  Then he kills him (according to Sheeran).  The punch of this book is a detailed and blow-by-blow telling of Hoffa's supposed meeting with his executioner (the mob supposedly sends someone you would never expect when it is decided you've pushed their patience too far) and the deed.  Sheeran is detailed and convincing in his telling.  Sheeran also hints that Hoffa and certain mob bosses were behind the JFK assassination as a payback for Bobby Kennedy's war against organized crime as a Senate attorney and later Attorney General.  In fact, Sheeran thinks he may have delivered a package that was Lee Harvey Oswald's rifle to a contact in Baltimore days before the shooting of the president.<br /><br />Whether or not this is the true story of what happened to Jimmy Hoffa (and whether or not he was involved in JFK's assassination) will have to be for each reader to judge.

It lends itself well to a Sunday School class presentation series (I team taught this in December of '04).  The chapters focus on different actors in the birth drama including the women of the story, the shepherds and magi, the Jews and Christ child.  Background chapters include discussions of Roman Israel and Righteousness.<br /><br />The margins contain healthy cross references of Old Testament prophecy as well as suggested group discussion questions and activities.  Our class is more discussion focused, so we skipped the activities; the book served our purpose well.<br /><br />The chapters are short and to the point.  The author provides a lot of detail and scriptural references.  An interesting note is that the author fleshes out the discussion in some of his chapters by bringing points made in non-canonical writings of the time including Gnostic works as well as some works considered heretical by the folks who chose which writings to include in the Bible.<br /><br />I did not find these references to outside works bothersome, in fact they lent interesting perspectives to facets of the story the author was trying to flesh out where Gospel writers are light in terms of background or information.

Robert Utley's \\"A Life Wild and Perilous...\\" is a wonderful story of just about the most iconoclastic Americans produced by this country of ours.<br /><br />The Mountain Men were risk takers, rugged individualists, optimists and American patriots rolled into one (although being patriots did not interfere with some of them taking Mexican or British citizenship when it would help them settle in parts of the West that were not ours before the Mexican-American War).<br /><br />Utley begins right after the Lewis and Clark expedition, when two of those intrepid expedition members returned to the new lands in search of beaver pelts.  The story progresses through the fur trading companies, the likes of Jim Bridger, Kit Carson and ends shortly after the time of Charles Fremont.  By the time of the Gold Rush, the mountain men had spent their moment, the victims to changing  fashions (beaver pelts were in demand for men's hats primarily) and over trapping as well as growing popular interest in settlement and exploitation of the land.<br /><br />This book is mostly a chapter examination of the doings of the most famous of the mountain men.  Their hard life in the open, scrapes and alliances with natives (many had Indian wives and families), habits of trade and merriment and their epic journeys from there to there are explored in well written and at times riveting detail.<br /><br />Utley has added to an understanding of the American West by bringing back to life the men who established trade routes, guided the first settlers and importantly mapped and explored the great interior lands of the American continent.  This is a great and interesting story told well.	2004-12-30

The Berrybender gang start with their genteel imprisonment in Spanish Santa Fe and end up -- much reduced through cholera, Indian attacks and other ghastly means of death -- at the end of the story.  I won't give it away, but there is a much reduced cast, new players, surprising relationships and improbable outcomes.<br /><br />The story is gritty, with lots of hardship and a portrayal of how nasty and short frontier life could be.  Historical figures populate this book (Sam Houston, Kit Carson, Jim Bowie, the Bent  Brothers), but are used rather loosely and not constrained by their actual lives.  This isn't a problem, their appearance certainly adds flavor to the story.  Purists may mind that some of the famous die in the book decades before they did in real life, but their use to flavor the story is consistent with McMurtry's approach to this whole whimsical series.<br /><br />While this book still hangs on Tasmine's whims and management of the story, she is much less a commanding and energetic figure.  Occupied by children, bereaved by the death of a lover whom she couldn't quite reach in life anyway, still bewildered by her husband Jim Snow, the Sin Killer, Tasmine hasn't the energy to cause the entire encampment to rotate around her axis as she did in the previous books.  Her sisters come somewhat more to the fore as do some new characters introduced in this final installment.  The way the Berrybender crowd reacts to circumstance and meets life with their unusual expectations continues to propel this story forward.<br /><br />As with the other books, Folly and Glory is an entertaining read.  In retrospect, this series feels like a long comic strip rather than a Lonesome Dove type of deeply developed novel.  While not a great or memorable read, it is entertaining and enjoyable.vel.

That boy goes off to Vietnam as a Navy Seal and loses part of his leg -- as well as his innocence.<br /><br />Bob Kerrey's book is about the best I've seen of those biographies done by presidential wannabe's (he arguably was still in play when this was written).  By that I mean it is less self serving and more honest (mistakes made, mindsets typical of his time and place held, no claims to have embraced our current societal mores before his time, etc.).  Kerrey talks of his mistakes, fears and misdeeds as well as his hopes and dreams.  Nothing rocked his world and he was on track to be a faceless part of our country's backbone (town pharmacist in the middle of Nebraska) who you'd never heard of until Vietnam changed him.<br /><br />His experiences left him critical of his country's leadership and wary of war after he witnessed combat first hand and suffered a debilitating wound during his service in the Mekong River Delta.  He came back to the war a better informed citizen (in his portrayal) who had real personal objections to continued involvement in Vietnam (and to his credit didn't lead any wholesale condemnation of his soldier peers like the other Senator named Kerry (no relation and no \\"e\\").<br /><br />The book ends with his discharge from the naval hospital in Philadelphia and also with a postscript on a minor thread of the story.  His father had a brother lost in the Philippines during WWII who Kerrey never even knew existed until he accidentally came across a picture of the man.  His father, stereotypically reluctant to talk about his war experiences or the pain of his loss, finally asked Kerrey near his death to find out what happened to his brother.  This Kerrey did during his first term in the Senate.  This forgotten uncle didn't explain Kerrey as much as tie in the tragedy that is war -- even \\"good\\" wars like WWII.<br /><br />This is a very personal story, tightly written in simple and plain sentences.  It is an easy read, but also has the feel of honesty because of its lack of varnish as well as adjectives or claimed insights which many politicans doing bios place in their works to relfect on their future potentials as opposed to describing their past experiences.<br /><br />All in all a quick read that helps explain Bob Kerrey, a former Governor, Senator, current college president who was known as both quirky and thoughtful and independent.tragedy that is war -- even \\"good\\" wars like WWII.<br /><br />This is a very personal story, tightly written in simple and plain sentences.

I got the feeling that McMurtry decided he liked the story and characters after the first two short but engaging chronicles and decided to add some heft to this follow-on.<br /><br />The Berrybenders, the dis-functional fictional family of the old American West, are journeying with their contingent of Mountain Men, Indian joiners and others from the Annual Green River Mountain Man join-up to Bent's Fort, a real trading post on the Arkansas River.<br /><br />In this breezy tale, McMurtry joins the stories (if not always the destinies) of the Barrybenders, Indian warrior chiefs like The Partezon (Partisan - get it!) the real life Kit Carson, Pomp Charbonneau and the Sin Killer, aka Jim Snow who improbably marries Tasmin Berrybender, the protagonist of much of the story and its driving force.<br /><br />Part adventure, part historical fiction, large part soap opera, the characters weave romance, trysts, witty dialogue, improbable meetings (two European journalists in an early hot air balloon) and blood, death and mayhem in this engaging escape novel.<br /><br />I still can't decide if McMurtry is sketching some kind of cartoonish caricature of western tales, or just decided to dash off a fun tale packed with as many odd ball (and mostly two dimensional) characters as he could invent.  Either way, the series engages and remains good mind candy if one knows not to expect another Lonesome Dove.	2004-08-10

First, it is a thrilling adventure story.  Second, it is a wonderful management study in planning, goal setting and organization.  Third, it is a classic debunker, undermining the aura (at least in the English speaking world) surrounding Robert Scott and his tragic assault on the South Pole.<br /><br />Scott and Roald Amundsen engaged in a great struggle to reach \\"The last place on earth,\\" the South Pole.  Each had been to polar regions before, each had become national and even international celebrities due to their trekking.  Each was aware of the other party's presence on the Antarctic Continent during the same months of 1911-1912 as they raced to be the first men to stand at the bottom of the world.<br /><br />Scott and Amundsen were two different breeds.  Scott was a helpless romantic.  Even after bitter experience and near tragedy in previous expeditions, he refused to learn from Eskimos, Norwegians or others who were battling around the turn of the century to achieve various cold weather firsts (first to the north pole, first to traverse the Northwest Passage -- which went to Amundsen -- first to cross Greenland, etc.)  Thus, Scott relied on British pluck and manliness instead of skis, dogs, deer and seal suits and a properly suited diet.<br /><br />Amundsen was a consummate student on the other hand.  He possessed not only the gift of great vision and the ego necessary to pursue it, but also the humility to know that his trip did not have to feature every facet made anew, but should be the culmination of what others had learned when surviving and moving over the planet's most forbidding environment.  Thus, Amundsen took dogs to Antarctica, wore clothing he observed the Eskimos using during his journey through the Northwest Passage, relied on skis for human transportation and dieted in a way observed to prevent scurvy.<br /><br />Amundsen also worked at his project.  Starting years before his trek, he organized the people, finances, equipment (much specialty made and field tested in Norway's northern regions) and talked, talked, talked to those whose experiences had something to teach them. Contrast this disciplined approach to organization and logistics with Scott's haphazard throwing together of men, equipment and &eacute;lan and the outcome of the race is preordained to the reader before it has begun.<br /><br />(the contrast between the two approaches is such a stark lesson on planning and organization that I suspect this book will show up in business school reading lists if it has not already).<br /><br />Amundsen's journey to the South Pole was uneventful compared to Scott.  Conditions were harsh, temperatures low, blizzards raged, but the Norwegian's party averaged a workman like 15 or so miles a day with dogs, skis and proper provisions.  Scott, on the other hand, was not sure of his starting date, did not map out nor account for food consumed during the trip and relied on man-hauling his sleds the 1400 miles round trip to the Poles and his main camp.  With the same weather and conditions, Scott and his polar attack team wound up dead after what their diaries reveal was a miserable existence on the Polar Ice Cap (they did reach the Pole, expiring on the way home).<br /><br />The only area in which Scott excelled over Amundsen was in romantic writing.  Scott's published works on his earlier journey to Antarctica are apparently a moving and heroic read.  Amundsen was about as workmanlike a writer as he was a captain.  For this and other reasons lain out by the author (in his mind much having to do with a decaying empire's need for heroes performing heroic deeds -- even heroic dying) Scott is remembered much the way Pickett's Charge is -- a glorious and manly statement of such heroics that it has made the underlying (and preventable) disaster a footnote to the story.<br /><br />This is a riveting book that I found hard to put down. Although the author probably takes a few too manyturns at whacking Scott when his shortcomings are evident (we get the point), he has succeeded in writing a first rate thrilling adventure, historic debunking and interesting management study.turns at whacking Scott when his shortcomings are evident (we get the point), he has succeeded in writing a first rate thrilling adventure, historic debunking and interesting management study.	2004-08-09

Jim Bishop does not fictionalize his stories the way a Vidal of Sharra does -- what he does is add color and texture to actual events and actual dialogue to make two dimensional histories come alive.<br /><br /> In this book, Bishop, as I understand it, took only the dialogue and scenes appearing in the Gospels to tell the story of Christ's final day on earth. The book is broken down into hour by hour chapters. Three background chapters -- one on Jesus? life; one on the Jewish world and one on the Roman -- give the &quot;greatest story ever told&quot; context and allow the reader to more easily slip back into a world 2,000 years old.<br /><br /> As I understand the Gospels -- and I am by no means an expert -- Bishop remains true to the Jesus story and the biblical account. While the Gospels are moving in themselves, having such a skilled writer describe the scenery, the points in Jerusalem where Jesus was taken and traveled and the characters who inhabit the drama enlivens an already supremely rich story.	2004-07-21

Hoffecker's diligent research and clear writing give a good account of how those elected bodies called legislatures (if one can assume Delaware's is somewhat of a proxy for the bunch) articulate -- or sometimes fail to -- the will of citizens as they self-govern.<br />Delaware was unique among the 13 original colonies in that it was not wholly a separate polity.  The year 1704 is when the state marks its debut as a political entity -- the year in which the Penn family granted what had been the three lower counties its own General Assembly separate from that of Pennsylvania's.  The separation was not complete, however, as both colonies (technically proprietorships) continued to share a common governor or proprietor.  It was not until 1776 that Delaware received a chief executive to call its own along with a legislature.<br />Even today a small body representing small districts (41 members of the House, 21 Senate, average House district less than 20,000 people), Delaware's General Assembly has been uncommonly close to those they represent.  This has not always produced better government; in fact Hoffecker documents the times at which the General Assembly was unable to effectively resolve burning issues or even function well.  However, it has become an institution that the author describes as at the height of its ability in fulfilling the ideals of representative democracy.  Filled with wonderful anecdotes, well illustrated and successful in its job of describing the growth of the institution.	2004-07-08

Would I even try climbing an expert level mountain?  2.  Would I cut a lifeline sending my partner to certain death if I knew not cutting would kill us both? 3. Would I have the will to endure crushing pain and desperation when it all could be ended easily by just giving up?<br />I think the third question was easiest for me.  The will to live is just too great in most of us to give up.  However, as we read of Joe Simpson's incredible climb out of an icy hell -- on a severely broken leg, each step one of excruciating pain, we can understand when he asks himself the same question.<br />On the first, no.  I get all the tough mountain climbing thrills I need vicariously through Jon Krakauer's books or one's like this.  I understand that some are driven to assault the globe's most difficult peaks, but I just don't see the point.  Almost all of the wonderful mountaineering books of the last decade involve death and mayhem among people who knowingly chose to place themselves in positions where those outcomes were a high probability.<br />The second question is the most difficult and the one the reader will ask himself over and over during this very well written book.<br />Joe Simpson and Simon Yates climbed a forbidding peak in South America alone, with their only support a neophyte camped a few miles from the starting point in a camp itself a day's mule ride away from civilization.  The climb up went well enough, but on the way down the snow encrusted and storm tossed mount, Simpson broke his leg horribly in a fall.  Improvising a plan for Yates to lower Simpson down a crevice riddled glacier one painful rope length at a time, the pair started their self-rescue at night.  The first few hours went painfully slow, then Simpson reeled over a cliff into nothingness.  Unable to see what had befallen Simpson, Yates hung on above -- the rope slowly but surely pulling Yates himself toward the abyss.  Knowing (in both their minds at that time according to the book) that to hold on would kill them both, Yates made the supremely difficult decision to cut the rope -- condemning Simpson to a long fall and probable death -- to save himself.<br />The next morning after climbing down, Yates could only see a snow covered crevice which he assumed his friend had plummeted into from high above.  Unknown to Yates, Simpson had miraculously landed on a snow ledge below the lip of the crevice -- mangled leg and all.  The weak ice roof of the crevice had slowed his fall enough to permit survival.  Yates went off to camp heavy with the knowledge he had killed his friend and sure the world would neither understand nor forgive.<br />Simpson, meanwhile, endured a 48 hour plus ordeal to drag his wrecked body 50 or so feet out of the crevice and then over miles over rough ground to camp.  As you might imagine, the reuniting of Simpson and Yates was quite a scene.<br />This book is taught and well written.  Although Simpson's book, Yates is given space to describe in his own words the story from his perspective from the point he thought his fateful decision had separated their paths.<br />This is a great survival story and leaves the reader asking:  &quot;Would I, could I, have cut the rope?&quot;t time according to the book) that to hold on would kill them both, Yates made the supremely difficult decision to cut the rope -- condemning Simpson to a long fall and probable death -- to save himself.<br />The next morning after climbing down, Yates could only see a snow covered crevice which he assumed his friend had plummeted into from high above.

One is the incredible rise from ignominy of Hamilton, a bastard born overseas (this was considered worse than poverty among his class conscious contemporaries), through incredible discipline, innate intelligence and a fierce will to succeed.<br />The other is the story of a patriot who Zelig-like was everywhere of importance during the winning of our independence and founding of our government.  Hamilton not only became in effect Washington's Chief of Staff during the Revolution and a combat hero at Yorktown, but was also the driving force behind ratification of the Constitution and the architect of the American system of government and economics.<br />My hope is that Hamilton, certainly the most underappreciated of the founders and arguably the most significant after Washington, finally gets his due as a keystone in making American self government a success.  As Chernow illustrates so very well, Hamilton's defense of and advocacy for the Constitution through the Federalist papers (written with Madison and Jay, but largely Hamilton's work), was what probably saved our beloved document from non-ratification in New York and other states.  As our first Treasury Secretary, his establishment of public credit, war debt assumption, a revenue collection system and other necessary features of government -- over the stern objections of Thomas Jefferson and the Republicans -- gave stability and permanence to our governing sytems.<br />Hamilton was not only exhaustive in his machinations and plans, he was also brilliant in his vision and crafty in bringing those visions to reality.<br />This book is not a hagiography.  Hamilton was brilliant and indispensable, but as Chernow portrays he did have faults that caused him trouble and would have made him in all probability not a good candidate for president.  He worked best when under the license of the great Washington.  Hamilton's brilliance and incredible foresight were fostered and used by Washington - a leader who also had the supreme wisdom to temper the excesses of his unbelievably talented subordinate.  Out from under Washington's guidance, Hamilton's genius produced excesses of thought if not always deed.  Character flaws also got him into trouble as Chernow illustrates in the Reynolds Affair and the duel with Burr.  However, his contributions are shown by the author to be indispensable and critical to the keeping of our democratic government more than two centuries hence.<br />This is a wonderfully written book that is thoroughly researched.  It is comprehensive -- the author does an excellent job of weaving the personal Hamilton portrait with the public doings of the statesman.  The times and political milieu are also expertly drawn and brought to life.  In reading of the founders it always astounds me how hard fought -- and in most respects more vicious -- politics was among the founding generation compared to these last decades.  A warning for Jefferson fans, the author of the Declaration does not come off favorably, nor does Madison nor Monroe (this is after the start of the Washington Administration, not before) in this book.  However, given the documented evidence, their actions and deeds are credibly drawn by Chernow.  While this might ruffle some feathers of those who delve lightly into the period, Chernow's documentation certainly provides a more fully drawn portrait of those who firstdesigned themselves as Republicans (as opposed to Hamilton's Federalists) and who played politics as deviously, roughly and ruthlessly as Lyndon Johnson would in his day.<br />This is a great work of history and one I highly recommend.  The book is long, but Chernow's tight writing style makes it easy to read.designed themselves as Republicans (as opposed to Hamilton's Federalists) and who played politics as deviously, roughly and ruthlessly as Lyndon Johnson would in his day.<br />This is a great work of history and one I highly recommend.

Along the way, he encounters modern westerners and provides a taste of small-town America in what is today one of the least settled and developed parts of the North America (save for the numerous hydro-electric dams which have turned much of Lewis &amp; Clarks river pathways to lakes).<br />Each chapter features a snippet of what the explorers were enduring during their journey and then cuts to Duncan's experiences with the jaunts, journeys and people who in habit the trail area today.<br />This is not a bad book, and is entertaining at times.  It is uneven.  When Duncan meets an interesting modern westerner (Indian or White), the recounts are interesting.  The author lacks, however the ability to enliven the dull who make up most of us the way Bill Bryson seems to be able to do or the editorial judgement to leave mundane stories on the cutting room floor.  The historic parts and place descriptions are rather good and the casual history fan will come away with a better understanding of the great American journey known eponymously as Lewis and Clark.	2004-04-30

Although political decisions and the ambitions of kings as well as intrepid adventurers started the age of exploration, it was clearly economics which governed the establishment and success of colonies and determined whether or not landings and forts could attract sufficient settlers to become colonies as opposed to remaining lonely outposts garrisoned by impressed soldiers and agents of mercantilists. (This is not to belittle the role of imperial competition and advantage in colonial expansion, but those goals were either in pursuit of wealth or in response to the Spanish, who got started first and reaped an empire-enhancing wealth transfer early on  -- one of such dimensions that the competitors had to respond).<br />Different policies played a role in the success or failure of colonial adventures. The Spanish combined Catholic mission with regard to conversion of Indians with sheer terror to support their efforts. The French, possessed of cold lands productive in animal furs but not in the kind of agriculture that could support large numbers of French transplants, had to rely on alliance and diplomacy with local natives to maintain their presence. Both of these kingdoms governed their colonies directly from the crown, which allowed for uniformity of control as well as mistakes. The English approached colonization in a piecework model which led to differing methods of implantation and maintenance of their settlements. Productive early colonies like the Leeward Islands were given over to large land barons (after the local populations were wiped out by European germs), slavery and brutal control to keep imported Africans in check processing sugar cane). The New England colonies -- given over to Puritans as a convenient way to exile them from England proper, were religious refuges which at times had a somewhat more tolerant view of life with the native population than the Spanish but much less than the French (although they succeeded in clearing the area of Indians through disease and war just the same). The Southern colonies featured crown dominions (in the case of Virginia) that relied on control and force to keep slave labor and Indians at bay. The pressure for more land to plant profitable tobacco led to a brutalization of Indians who stood in the way of plantation formation. Pennsylvania, in the middle colonial region, was for a time a unique experiment of the private citizen William Penn that took perhaps the most enlightened (this is relative to the time of course) view of life with a native population. Never much under crown auspices for most of its history, the Penn experiment became a beacon for the outcasts (political, religious, economic) of the Old World who could gumption up enough nerve to transplant across the Atlantic. Nowhere in the English system did the local Indian population enjoy a better coexistence than in Pennsylvania (though that too, proved illusory in the long run as population pressures and disease led to the same land grabbing mentality as in other colonies).<br />What Taylor does extremely well is focus on the forces that controlled political decisions regarding colonization and development in North America. Germs played an incredible role, killing off 90% of Native Americans before large-scale contact with Europeans in most places. Technology and organization next doomed those few Indians left in this war for the continent. They could simply not compete with guns, horses and allegiance to crown or colony when they themselves were usually tiny members of small bands numbering in the hundreds or low thousands (with the exceptions of the Inca and Aztecs) who often warred with the next band as much as the local colonists.<br />It is interesting that Taylor, while very sympathetic and true to what is basically a story of annihilation of native cultures (for the vast part by disease, the great unplanned and unimagined ally of the Europeans), does not paint the Indians as a harmonious peaceful people inhabiting an Eden like continent prior to its despoiling by Europeans. While Indians lived fairly harmoniously with their surroundings (though not with each other as Taylor points out often, slavery, warfare, kidnapping and competition being normal aspects of inter-Indian affairs), they nonetheless shaped the local environment and remade the land to suit their needs. In agricultural areas, burning was practiced and evidence shows plant species were extinguished and changed to make way for or as a result of Indian farming. Rather than living as one with nature, the Indians shaped nature for their purposes, although their lack of technology and political organization made their imprint upon the land much less severe than that of the men of Europe.<br />Taylor focuses much of the book on the Spanish, English and French experiences - proper since they were the major players.  This book is comprehensive though, and tells the story of Dutch, Sweedish and Russian contact with North America.  Taylor also describes the Native peopling of North America, spending time describing their interaction with each other, their management of life on the continent prior to European discovery as well as attempts to survive with the new realities wrought by Europe.<br />This is a very comprehensive and thorough book that takes a look at the peopling of the North American continent through the broad lens of history.  This appropriate approach spends a lot of time on the geographic, demographic, economic and biological factors that informed, shaped and in many cases pre-ordained the outcomes when native cultures clashed with European and as European countries jockeyed for position in the New World.

First as a twentysomething &quot;it beats working&quot; trek with like-minded buddies, then later as a more mature filmmaker who returned after a few decades to visit areas he missed the first go around.<br />This book has the same theme as some of Bill Bryson's or David Horwitz's travelogues.  The history is interspersed with tales of the journey, giving background and understanding as to why certain places are worth visiting.  Thomson does not have the wit or humor of either, nor does he try to force it.  Some humorous events are recounted because they happened and happened to be humorous, but this author does not ply the wry observation or witty discourse.<br />The result is a solid travel book, if at times less than entertaining.  The reader is treated to a good geographic illustration of the high Andes as well as snapshots of life in and around those mountains today.  The history of the Inca people after contact with the conquistadors is interspersed with tales of Thomson's journeys in a way that I suspect will give almost every reader a much better understanding of what happened during the clash of these two empires.  Flashbacks are also provided of the famous explorers who led the way toward western appreciation of Inca roads and cities and whose material allowed Thomson to discover some sites only hinted at in the 1800's by his predecessors.<br />The author does delve into what apparently is an age-old enmity between archaeologists and explorers. In Thomson's telling, archaeologists are a bit miffed that explorers go careening around and get credit for discovering sites when archaeologists are the ones who must spend the hard, laborious years understanding them.  Explorers see archaeologists as a bit blinded to the forest by the trees -- you could spend a lifetime uncovering Machu Picchu with a toothbrush and miss the lost cities waiting under jungle cover just a ridge or two away.  Although Thomson gets along well enough with the archaeologists he bunks with early on, the explorers of the past who uncovered the lost Inca cities and whose treks serve as both the guidon and inspiration for Thomson's own, were anathema to contemporary archaeologists and remain so.<br />This is a long book that does drag in parts.  Sometimes, when the action the author is describing isn't very interesting, the reader is treated to its unfolding anyway.  Editing could have helped weed out some parts that didn't seem to enlighten the story.  However, overall this book does what it sets out to do.  It tells the story of an intrepid explorer and the finds he makes, describes current life in the high Andes, and tells the story of the demise of the Incas.ing Machu Picchu with a toothbrush and miss the lost cities waiting under jungle cover just a ridge or two away.

Bush.<br />Each president has at least a page dedicated to their life and presidency as well as a portrait and illustrations of events current to their times.  Presidents such as Lincoln and FDR and those who have served in the modern era have four to six page spreads describing their elections, the issues, their lives and the challenges they faced as president.<br />The write-ups are excellent summaries aimed at explaining the highlights to youth.  The photos, paintings and other illustrations make this a very inviting book that some children will browse while others delve into the writing.  Either way, older elementary school children have a very inviting and informative introduction into our presidents and history that should capture young imaginations.	2004-02-17

Books	4	8	10	N	N	Stossel is a Journalistic Breath of Fresh Air	This is a very accessible book from professional skeptic - journalist John Stossel.  In \\"Give Me a Break..,\\" the author confronts many conventional wisdoms of the media and elite opinion.<br />Stossel is a free-market Libertarian.  In this book, he describes his journey from a \\"go-along-with-the-pack-all-businesses-are-evil-and-all-regulations-good\\" journalist to a skeptic who has been persuaded by data and anecdote that government not only doesn't get it right in many cases, but that their cures are frequently more harmful than the problems they attempt to solve.<br />This book is short-chaptered and anecdote driven, buttressed by some statistics and expert opinion.  Among the examples of government policy gone awry:  federal regulations that so tightly control clearing of forests in the name of protecting woodlands that the resulting growth of forest fire incidence cost the lives of 23 fire-fighters in a recent year; the Bureau of Indian Affairs that tightly controls living on Indian reservations has produced the greatest threatened demographic group in America - Indians; federal flood insurance that costs tax-payers huge amounts of money to entice wealthy people to keep rebuilding beach homes on hurricane prone beaches (including the author for a time, he fesses); FDA regulations and procedures that keep promising drugs off the market for five to ten years for testing while people who may be helped die.<br />He also turns his sights on \\"do-gooder\\" groups like the folks who killed apple sales for a while when their faulty analysis supposed that the pesticide Alar was a threat to health; trial lawyers who add tremendous costs to society in pursuit of what are frequently lawyer driven payouts; how Erin Brokovitch didn't prove her case and that data around the plant in question revealed no increase in the cancers and sicknesses she and her allies claimed, etc., etc.<br />Stossel also presents a good defense of capitalism and the enlightened self-interest of our society that has produced technological and medical wonders, as well as the wealth which fuels mightily the envy that motivates many of its detractors.  His take on capitalism is a good one and a good antidote for the ramblings of many who condemn our system out of ignorance or while following the herd.<br />His book is convincing and importantly, accessible to the average reader.  He was preaching to the choir with me on many of his points, and I have read about many of the examples Stossel explores.  The great benefit of this book is that readers who are uninitiated should get a healthy dose of skepticism about what they read or hear on the news and question the agenda and efficacy of those promoting points of view or condemning activities and products.<br />Stossel's main points are two:  first, Americans need to look at the data before believing what they are told.  Second, our society's notion of risk is out of whack with what really are risky behaviors -- to boot, his network was fawning over stories that a certain brand of lighters were exploding and killing people.  The network wanted to treat it as a product design failure.  Actual deaths attributable to this cause:  1.<br />Stossel is not in the tank for corporate America and critical of everything government does.  He accepts the need for some government control over things like the environment and pollution and condemns corporations who do behave badly.  But Stossel also rejects the easy view of many in his industry that if it is business it is bad, and if the government or Ralph Nader says something needs to be changed it is good.<br />This is a refreshing and thought provoking book and should be read by any concerned with the issues Stossel presents.ty that has produced technological and medical wonders, as well as the wealth which fuels mightily the envy that motivates many of its detractors.

As in &quot;Da Vinci,&quot; the action takes place in and around the Catholic Church -- literally.  The bulk of the book involves Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon and his attractive Italian co-sleuth Vittoria Vetra racing between the Pope's office, the Vatican's secret archives, hidden Middle Age passageways, the crypt holding St. Peter's remains and various churches in Rome in an attempt beat a midnight calamity that threatens to destroy the Catholic Church at its very foundations.<br />The nutshell:  CERN, the world's most formidable collection of physicists, has produced and contained anti-matter, that theoretical substance present at the Big Bang.  Despite elaborate security, a vial of the anti-matter has been stolen by a resurgent Illuminati -- that cryptic group dating from the Middle Ages that purported to represent and defend scientific inquiry against the forces of a Church desperate to stamp out anything even remotely calling into question Rome's vision of the earth, man and their divine creation.<br />After waiting four centuries, the Illuminati have a chance to extract their revenge upon the Catholic Church.  The vial of anti-matter will escape containment when a battery mechanism allowing its suspension turns off at midnight on the day bereaved cardinals are gathered to select a new pope.  Anti-matter, when coming into contact with any matter (even air, or the sides of a container) produces an explosion so great that a pea-sized drop of the stuff could wipe out a mile square area.  And, the vial has been hidden someplace in the recesses of Vatican City.<br />Langdon appears because his specialty -- symbology -- makes him the foremost expert in possible clues to the Illuminati plot and the hiding place of the vial.  The beautiful Vetra appears because she was teamed with her father in the production of  anti-matter at CERN -- her father being a catholic priest/physicist who was attempting to prove the existence of Genesis with his work (he adopted her when she was an orphan).<br />Breathless describes this novel.  The entire story, except for Langdon's educational lectures on the Illuminati, various aspects of Vatican lore, and Middle Age Italian artists and architecture, takes place between the time most allow for dinner to follow lunch.  The action never stops -- it is ceaseless.<br />It is also very entertaining.  Anyone attracted to history, secret societies, church politics past and present and a whiff of physics as backdrop to a ripping good yarn will appreciate this book.ul Vetra appears because she was teamed with her father in the production of  anti-matter at CERN -- her father being a catholic priest/physicist who was attempting to prove the existence of Genesis with his work (he adopted her when she was an orphan).<br />Breathless describes this novel.

The basic story had great possibility and is at times interesting.  The author painted what seemed to be a realistic description of hard scrabble farm life for those left behind to survive while the men folk fought for slavery and state's rights.  Many descriptions of how ordinary people used nature to make a working farm in an age without many conveniences seemed true to form and tested the mettle of the characters.<br />The hospital experiences of Inman and trials encountered during his long desertion from Lee's embattled 1864 army toward home (Cold Mountain, along the western North Carolinian border) were also interesting and realistic.<br />This is basically a story of journey's on two levels.  First is the physical journey of Inman as he makes his way home.  He must dodge hunger and the Home Guard, a posse band hunting down the what had become a horde of army deserters at that time.  The other journey is inward and occurs among four major characters.  Inman has become a pacifist an turns toward his own interests and an imagined better life without war and with his true love, Ada.  Ada, a Charleston belle left kept without any practical skills by a doting father, must fend for herself after he dies.  She is first shocked by real life and then learns to work with the aid of Ruby, who has a seemingly endless store of knowledge to address every situation. Ruby was, I found, the most interesting character.  A self-raised waif, she is sent to Ada's farm by a neighbor woman who knows Ruby's great skills at survival and Ada's need for someone with a clue about how to milk cows, pick apples, raise chickens and generally make a productive farm run.<br />The chapters alternate between Inman's long migration west and Ada's coming to grips with her new and harder life (but one in which she learns to take great pride) as a mountain farmer.<br />The pacing is somewhat slow and languid.  The author almost never fails to detail scenery and much of the book is taken up with the color of the sky, rising of various constellations, glistening of leaves in rainy weather or qualities of various snowfalls when the story moves to the late months.  The book is very heavy on description, which is a plus if that's what you like in a novel.  It is somewhat short on action, although there are interesting situations and characters met along the way (primarily by Inman, though Ruby's ne'er-do-well father makes an welcome diversion).<br />This is a love story as well as a story of journeys, although the love story angle was perhaps the weakest part (save at the ending, which by the way will be unsatisfying to some).  During the first hundred pages while Ada is either milling about the farm on her way to death by starvation or learning to adjust to her harsh reality in the early Ruby part of the book, her thoughts turn not once to Inman, the great love of her life.  In fact, during the first half of the book, the reader is wondering if Ada even knew (or remembered) Inman.  I did find it odd that Ada, in her despair and mentally wishing for a life-line thinks only of her father or her Charleston youth and not of the one man who we later learn touched her soul before he donned the rebel grey.<br />I think readers who like a more literary approach to fiction and enjoy nuanced descriptive writing will probably enjoy this book a lot.  Those looking for a good yarn and a gripping escape may feel under-nourished by the end.ail scenery and much of the book is taken up with the color of the sky, rising of various constellations, glistening of leaves in rainy weather or qualities of various snowfalls when the story moves to the late months.

Like many, he's got a ho-hum job and is motivated to do just the minimum to skate by.  His latent talent is utilized only to pull a minor scam on his high-tech employer (Wyatt) whereby he jiggers corporate budget accounts to buy a Malcolm Forbes style retirement party for one of his loading dock buds.<br />Cute stunt, but a felony nonetheless.  Knowing they could throw his twenty-something carcass in jail for a long time, his employers make him an offer he can't refuse.  No prosecution if he agrees to become a corporate mole.  He'll fulfill his end of the bargain by becoming employed by Wyatt's rival Trion Systems, the wonderkund company of the high tech world.<br />Given a fake background attractive enough to entice any headhunter as well as a bag of high tech spy gizmos, Adam is soon snatched up by Trion.<br />His espionage gets off to a good start, and he is able feed critical information to his handlers at Wyatt.  Through a lucky break, he catches the eye of Trion's legendary founder Jock Goddard and gains access to the brain trust of his quarry.<br />Here the moral dilemma develops (if a book about deceit and lying can have a moral dilemma!).  Jock turns out to be the father Adam always wanted and the man he must betray to keep Wyatt from throwing him in jail.  What's a scheming junior yuppie to do?<br />This is an exciting book that is fast paced and very tightly written.  Finder is very good at developing characters and at keeping the twists and turns coming and believable.<br />There are surprises aplenty in this book as the reader is constantly challenged to wonder what in Adam's world is true and what is a careful deception.<br />This corporate thriller reminded me somewhat of Michael Crichton's book \\"Disclosure\\" - intelligent suspense story focused in the high-tech corporate world.

Like many of his age, he was swept up in the early romanticism of the Civil War and would do anything to join the Union Army -- including lie about his age and run away from home (not an uncommon way to volunteer).<br />He joined the 10th New Jersey Volunteers and was off to \\"see the elephant\\" (as big adventures were idiomized at the time).  Boyd drilled, trained, learned army life and saw battle in 1864 and 1865.<br />Like some on both sides, Boyd deserted after the horror of a wounding and the death around him became too much.  He hid in a Pennsylvania outhouse, was befriended by a local girl (who he later returned to marry), caught, returned to his unit and saw the end of the war with Sheridan in the Valley and through Appomattox.<br />This short book is written for children of about 5th grade or so.  It gives a good account of life in the Union army, the frightening reality of war and a good depiction of how a young person deals with their own failings and restoration.  In addition, the years before Jimmy enlists are covered, giving the reader a window on small farm life at that time.<br />The book does have a glossary, which is helpful.  I think it would have been a little more accessible for young readers had the terms been parenthetically described in the text, but that is a minor quibble.  All in all a good book that may fuel the young person's interest in the Civil War.	2003-12-31

His &quot;Campaigning With Crook&quot; follows his months of hard service in pursuit of the Indians who brought Custer to earth.<br />Their campaign was brutal.  Across 1500 miles of trails, 2,000 cavalry and infantry tried to bring their foes to battle.  They had to travel light to have any chance of catching their supple enemy.  Light travel meant no tents, light equipage, few overcoats, scarce rations and no oats for the horses.  As a result, men traveled and slept in the rain (once for eleven consecutive days), shivered in the cold and drenched themselves in northern streams and rivers crossing fords that reached chin level in some places.  Only two Indian fights of note occurred for all their efforts and in the end the men lost over 2/3 of their horses to overwork, starvation and the need to fill their own bellies (we do learn that captured Indian pony meat is much sweeter and less stringy than horseflesh).<br />This is a fascinating book.  The author is in high bravado and so are his comrades.  War work, the actual fighting, seems like sport to some of the men.  Bravery and coolness under fire abound.  Convinced of the nobleness of their cause, these soldiers suffer none of the introspection, war weariness, confused morality or lack of certainty of their right that one associates with modern war literature (at least as portrayed by Charles King).  The first person account of hard life on the trail is a wonderment; I couldn't imagine many people, professionals or otherwise, suffering the privations and elements today the way these soldiers did -- they almost expected such chance and treatment and bore up incredibly well in body and attitude.<br />The book gets a few dings for what now reads like antiquated writing style (and very prevalent in late 1800 prose.  I admit this is probably because a modern audience has not been raised on this style).  Pasted together like associated magazine articles (I wondered if this had originally been issued in installments), the story is jumpy and disconnected in many parts.  There is much dialogue with the reader that is largely absent from today's writings (ie, &quot;and now, dear reader, I take you to an incident that could have been mentioned before during the description of our starting out, but for want of brevity of that narrative was delayed until now....&quot; -- I'm paraphrasing this, but examples like it are found throughout the book).<br />This is a book rich in details that fascinate.

It is impossible to follow characters throughout the book; though many reappear over the book's some 200 pages, they are not meant to be the focus of a drama or military biography.<br />I suspect Priest's method of letting the soldiers' recollections drive the pace of this fast-paced and confusing combat portrait is to try and recreate -- as much as a book can -- the utterly confusing, disorienting, violent and formless experience of combat.  In this, the author succeeds brilliantly.<br />This book is probably not for the first time Civil War reader and will disappoint anyone looking for the story of Pickett's Charge in terms of where it stood in Lee's strategy and the Battle of Gettysburg.  But for the Civil War aficionado, Priest's work delivers a wonderful micro history that has carried this reader closer to the action -- what I imagine the real action -- than any other author.<br />This is history written before units are marked on maps (although Priest's maps are excellent, numerous and easy to follow) and before the likes of Coddington, Sears or Catton have had a chance to tell the larger story.  For any reader wanting to get a feel of what it must have been like to charge into the bullets and canister flying from Cemetery Ridge like wind driven rain, this book can't be beat.must have been like to charge into the bullets and canister flying from Cemetery Ridge like wind driven rain, this book can't be beat.	2003-12-16

Fodor's has put this book out and it is an excellent travel guide and introduction to 25 or so major attractions east of the Mississippi (plus two in Arkansas and one in Minnesota).<br />The first chapter has basic travel info including safety tips, park entrance fee information, suggestions on further detailed info for those interested and other general stuff that is helpful to those journeying out among our national public lands.<br />The chapters on individual parks are well organized over about twenty pages that gives enough information to serve as a total travel guide for those considering a visit.  Each park has a good two tone map that is easy to read and provides good orientation.  Besides information on what to do, trail options, fees and the basics, there is a helpful &quot;if you only have one day&quot; that allows whirlwind travelers the opportunity to focus on the memorable and highlights to give as good of a flavor of the particular park that one can acquire between sunup and sundown.<br />The only drawback is that the book has no pictures, so readers will probably want to check out online guides for those that pique their interests or use this book after they have seen photos of park attractions.<br />It is very well organized and a good essential for those planning park trips.	2003-12-06

His books still speak to the reader in a literary style that brings the feeling of the war and its participants very much alive.<br />&quot;Mr. Lincoln's Army&quot; is the first of his three-part trilogy on the Army of the Potomac.  Catton traces the tragic evolution of this army -- always a superb fighting force in the ranks -- from a misused and abused weapon to the anvil that finally broke the rebellion.<br />In this book, Catton focuses on one of America's few men of Destiny -- at least until he had the opportunity to confront destiny in the face -- General George B. McClellan.  McClellan picked up the pieces of the Army of the Potomac twice.  First, after its inauspicious start at the First Battle of Bull Run and again after the army's route following the second tussle with the Confederacy near that same small battlefield.<br />McClellan was good at everything in which a general had to excel except fighting.  An outstanding organizer and moral builder, &quot;Little Mac&quot; trained the army to a professional level and instilled in it an esprit de corps that helped sustain it through disappointment and disaster.<br />The one thing McClellan could not do, as Catton illustrates through his focus on the Peninsula Campaign and the Battle of Antietam, was use this superbly honed weapon decisively in battle.  Always thinking he was outnumbered when in fact he held the advantage in forces, and lacking the inner confidence to take even good battle risks, he wasted multiple opportunities to end the war (or at least the existence of the Army of Northern Virginia) and save years of conflict and hundreds of thousands of lives.  McClellan ends up as the ultimate in tragic figures, outwardly seeming so perfect for the job and bearing the loftiest of expectations as a savior, but inwardly cowed by fears and suspicions that he wasn't up to it.<br />This book is a wonderful and evocative portrait of the spirit of the Army of the Potomac in the McClellan era.  Catton's great strength is the use of anecdotes to draw the big picture and sniff out &quot;what was in the air&quot; at different points in time.  Thus his books are not exhaustive campaign and battle portraits and are short on troop movements and deployments of particular units.  He seeks to demonstrate what was actually happening when all the personalities and actors of a moment are factored together.  It is a big picture look at his subject buttressed by observations, iconic stories and the unusual that allows the reader to understand the feeling that surrounded events.<br />Thus, Catton focuses mightily on the relationship between McClellan and Lincoln's administration, his relationship and the performance of senior officers and in deciphering the motives, mindsets and chess game that seemed to envelope significant figures in the Army of the Potomac to a much greater degree than any other Union or Confederate army engaged in the conflict.<br />As all of Catton's writings on the Civil War are, this one is a classic.a wonderful and evocative portrait of the spirit of the Army of the Potomac in the McClellan era.

We see how Lincoln and Grant are drawn toward each other through a shared and fundamental understanding of what it would take to win the war and the will to do it -- incredibly a trait Lincoln could find in no other General selected to head the Army of the Potomac.<br />The actual management of the Union's armies and efforts is given great attention.  Even the Civil War devotee who knows a lot about the battles of the war will appreciate this focus on grand strategy, army management and the particular and singular attributes possessed by Grant to manage the affair to a successful conclusion.<br />A wonderful book, as is it's predecessor, &quot;Grant Moves South.&quot;	2003-11-26

This book is a case study of the 1861-63 Grant, using his battles, first person accounts, records and Grant's own words to form a picture of the warrior.  In this, Catton does an excellent job.<br />His thesis is that Grant was a different cut of General than the north possessed.  One who early on grasped both the objectives of the war - to crush Southern armies and not occupy places - as well possessed of the will to learn how to win the new kind of war the country was waging.<br />Grant's own iron-cored (Catton's description) sense of himself, as well as his willingness to both learn and take good risks set him apart from almost every other warrior in the North.  He was a fierce warrior who from his first encounter with the Confederates understood that the battle had to be taken to the enemy - and that delay for planning, training and logistics benefited the enemy as much as his forces.  This appreciation Grant brought with him to the conflict.  It is evident from his earliest forays at Fts. Henry and Donelson as well as the inconclusive field of Belmont.  Other facets of this warrior had to be learned. In this Grant displayed an openness to the revelations of his own short comings and a willingness to show the world that he was prepared to be a student of warfare.  Thus, even difficulties like Shiloh taught Grant that southern demoralization was not a constant factor and that defense in the face of the enemy were necessary and did not sap the fighting spirit of his troops.  His early failed approaches to Vicksburg led him to throw away military maxims about supply lines, the necessity of holding fixed points and both the opportunity and advantages of an army living off the land.<br />Grant was a learner, an opportunist and a serious warrior who understood what the main thing was.  In an era when political infighting and external political considerations mattered more than they seemed to in 20th Century American warfare, Grant let his actions advance his career (with some timely and great help from Congressman Washburn - his first political patron).<br />Catton gives the reader the whole story.  This is a study of the man and his development as a warrior.  Civil War readers who have feasted on the likes of Sears and others who write so well of battles and campaigns at the regimental level may be somewhat surprised that Catton's study relies much less on military detail and more on campaign strategy and command function.  In this, Catton's work is more of an epic and serves to give the reader a picture of why things happened rather than an exhaustive account of what happened.<br />An oldie but a goodie - Catton should be required reading for every Civil War enthusiast and his Grant military biographies are wonderful examples of a master at his craft.to in 20th Century American warfare, Grant let his actions advance his career (with some timely and great help from Congressman Washburn - his first political patron).<br />Catton gives the reader the whole story.

In a departure for John Grisham, those big things are not the focal point of the story.<br />This book is a reflection on the tough lives of small farmers and those they employ.  In 1952 Arkansas, the Chandler family is eeking out a living season to season with cotton and the help of hill people and Mexicans during harvest time.<br />Seven-year old Luke is the narrator.  His world is the Chandler cotton farm, not very good low land in Arkansas that gets flooded first when there is too much rain.  Living in an unpainted clapboard house with his grandparents, his mom and dad and dreams of playing for the St. Louis Cardinals, Luke is part of the operation, having hoed in the spring and put on his own sack to pick 100 pounds of cotton a day during harvest time.<br />As they do every year, the Chandlers take on help to get the cotton crop in before the rains.  Help this year is a band of a dozen Mexicans who stay in the barn loft and the Spruill family, \\"hill people\\" who camp in their front yard -- right on the spot Luke uses for home plate when he imitates Stan Musial's moves to the porch radio during Cardinal broadcasts.<br />Both groups have characters that make the seven-year old world wise before his time.  Although incidents occur which could well be the point in a suspense thriller, Grisham uses them as background in this story.  In A Painted House, he is seeking to show the most difficult season (harvest time) in the difficult world of a typical farm family through the eyes of a seven year old.<br />Grisham succeeds.  Although this is a slow book, with a gentle pace (where it even has a pace), the author's handling of dialogue and description is superb.  The telling of the story is what is on display here, not the story.  The book is an enjoyable diversion where the reader gets a good mind's eye view of the life of one little boy in 1950's Arkansas.	2003-11-04

This 400-page description of his journey of discovery brings Alaska into sharper focus for those of us &quot;lower-48ers&quot; who haven't been there.<br />In this book, the natural beauty of the state and the bitter cold share billing with the people in making a memorable story.  The author has personality and style that allows him to quickly connect with strangers -- a useful trait when one needs invitations and personal stories to fill out a book.  Thus we meet Tina, a Prince of Wales Island lady who has lived a life of turmoil between reflecting the glamour of life as depicted by People Magazine and the certainty and pride of her native Indian culture.  We meet a captain and his crew in Barrow (the country's northernmost town, with the northernmost post office, the northernmost Mexican restaurant, etc.), waiting on the dangerous frozen arctic ocean ice to spear a whale as his forefathers have for centuries.  We meet bush people, particularly one family who lives alone, sixty miles from the nearest road and just below the Arctic Circle, in the warm embrace of nature and family while 40 degree below zero temperatures lurk outside.  We meet fishermen who take Jenkins on to crew their boat on salmon runs, guides who take vacation hunters to the wilderness to shoot moose, Iditarod champion dog sled mushers, the neighbors in Seward (where the Jenkins family has home base for their sojourns), bush pilots, politicians, Eskimos and escapees from the continental US living out dreams and fantasies in the great north.<br />Always, the landscape and cold dominates.  Alaska is a land of immense beauty as well as immense area.  Jenkins describes mountains whose rise from surrounding plain to peak rivals any in the world and frozen tundra that stretches well beyond all the area the eye can see.  Bears, eagles, moose and other wildlife are ever-present in Alaska.  (To an East Coast American, it must seem like living in a zoo.)  Even in moderately sized towns like Seward, the police log reads like a Jeff Corwin Experience as people deal with bears in their garbage, walking through their yards and lunching on the occasional family pet.<br />Jenkins does a good job of weaving human experiences and natural observation into a book.  In Alaska, it would be impossible to do otherwise.  Distance, bitter cold and sunlight dominate so many aspects of life that they are a part of the beginning, middle and end of every story.<br />I thought the author sometimes wrote with too many words, particularly when he allowed his wandering thoughts to drift onto the page.  A good editor would have improved the flow in parts of this book.  A few of his experiences lagged and seemed out of place among the high adventures and physical challenges presented in most parts.  This is a minor quibble, however.

The Lafferty's are excommunicated Latter Day Saints, thrown out from the church because of their insistence on taking founder Joseph Smith at his word and accepting such disavowed commandments as polygamy and blood atonement.  Their crime was real and brutal.  Krakauer was able to interview Dan Lafferty at length from his prison cell in Utah where he is serving two life sentences for his acts.  Even years later, this man is externally at peace with himself in believing he answered the call of his lord to remove two who stood in the way of The Plan.<br />In order to explain, or give background to the Lafferty's religiously inspired killings, Krakauer explores the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS or Mormons) at length.  He describes Mormonism from its founding by Joseph Smith in upstate New York, through their bloody emigration west through Illinois and Missouri to Utah, and the establishment of what the early believers hoped would be a nation apart from the rest of the world.  The bloody trials at the hands of suspicious neighbors in the American mid-west are detailed (confrontations that cost the life of their founder Smith and gave rise to Brigham Young).  So is Young's establishment of the Mormon state of Utah (Deseret at the time) in an attempt to separate the Saints from America.  The Mountain Meadows Massacre and the killing three of John Wesley Powell's Grand Canyon explorers are detailed.  These last two violent chapters -- perpetrated by Mormons and possibly with the knowledge of Young in the case of Mountain Meadows (according to the author) -- bear witness to Mormonism at its most insular and reactionary.  These killings were related at least in part to the original Mormon doctrine of blood atonement, a tenet revealed by Smith that called for the spilling of blood for \\"crimes\\" (or religious failings) serious enough that only death was judged a proper set off.<br />Polygamy, or plural or celestial marriage, the taking of multiple wives as commanded by Joseph Smith and popularized by Brigham Young, is explored in depth. It was many things -- a distinguishing characteristic of Mormonism, the practice that caused non-Mormons to react in horror and disgust, the percipitator of Congressional laws and the tenet that kept Utah out of the embrace of the larger Union in the late 1800's.<br />Although the church decided to abandon polygamy around 1890 as a price for gaining statehood and acceptance, it remained a sharp dividing line among Mormons.  This abandonment of one of the Church's founding testaments has caused schisms in the church, excommunications and the creation of fundamentalist outposts throughout the American West of communities of practicing polygamists who while officially removed as LDS members by the mainstream church, consider themselves the true Mormon's and keepers of God's commandments as revealed through Smith.<br />These Mormon fundamentalists have given rise to perpetrators of murder, statutory rape, female brutalization and other crimes in the last several decades.  As true believers who are convinced that only they are living right with God and that they face an ungodly hostile world (counting LDS leadership), many turn to god-talking for revelations on how to deal with the challenges and frustrations that lay in their paths.  These types of revelations have produced the Lafferty's -- convinced that God told them to take the lives of a young lady and her eighteen month old daughter, as well as the kidnappers of Samantha Smart.<br />Krakauer does a good job of weaving the history of Mormonism, the religious split within the faith between accommodationists and fundamentalists and the fringe fundamentalist groups that have given rise to violent men like the Lafferty's.<br />The author does point out that the vast Majority of Mormons -- and even the majority of Mormon fundamentalists -- are non-violent people living lives filled with close families, spirituality and wholesomeness.  The religion has produced -- as have all religions -- seekers who establish at least in their own minds direct links to the almighty or revelations of the &quot;true&quot; plan of God that lead them to acts abhorred by their fellow travelers.  These aberrants are the focus of the author.  He does a good job of explaining the particular mind-set of Dan and Ron Lafferty and the background of America's only home-grown large religious denomination.  Krakauer shows how this history spawned the doctrine, disagreements, schisms and personalities that gave voice and meaning to the terrible impulses that produced Dan and Ron Lafferty.<br />This is a very interesting book.  The history of Mormonism is fascinating and I think Krakauer does a good job of exploring the religion as it unfolded.  I am sure LDS will accuse him of focusing on errors and omissions of the past instead of the millions of hard working and clean living LDS who are by very many measures the epitome of a stable, productive and happy people.  This is true, but Krakauer is specifically hunting for the why that has enabled excommunicated Mormons who self style themselves as fundamentalists to produce religiously inspired perpetrators of ghastly violent acts.<br />His exploration of some of these perpetrators, including the Laffertys, paints a disturbingly interesting portrait of some of the lunatic fringe who cloak themselves in what they see as the &quot;true&quot; image of Mormonism.<br />A very intersting non-fiction book.ps that have given rise to violent men like the Lafferty's.<br />The author does point out that the vast Majority of Mormons -- and even the majority of Mormon fundamentalists -- are non-violent people living lives filled with close families, spirituality and wholesomeness.

Also, the Dead Sea and other recent scrolls do not give the statements ascribed to them by the author, except for one which contains an ancient Greek word that can be translated in various ways -- and upon one translation not generally accepted he bases his assertions).<br />The above are important because the general statement of truth the author makes would lead some to believe he meant existence of the historic characters, groups and happenings as well as the conclusions he takes from them.  <br />That digression aside, this is one of the best novels I've read -- great pacing, fascinating history, terrific conspiracy and interesting symbology and code breaking.  Truly a book you'll stay up late to read.	2003-10-07

His stories read like well honed long magazine articles and capture the drama and danger of high altitude mountain climbing (Into Thin Air) as well as mental soloing(Into The Wild).<br />Eiger Dreams is a collection of stories about mountaineering and mountaineering culture.  This collection of a dozen or so chapters (I suspect all were magazine articles first) regales the reader with the danger of high-altitude climbing, the uniqueness of attitude among many of the climbers and a slice of the culture that surrounds the climbing world.<br />On the whole the stories are gripping and interesting.  It falls short only in one or two instances when the author delves into set place stories like describing the town near Mt. Blanc that seems to derive it's personality from the towering rock and those who are drawn to it in great multitudes each year.<br />The chapters on individual climbs introduce the reader to the thrills and dangers of high-risk climbing, without the chance that one will tumble out of an armchair 10,000 feet to become part of a mountain.  Particularly enjoyable are the articles on the North face of the Eiger, the author's own journey to solo climb Alaska's Devil's Thumb at age 23 and a chapter on the Burgesses -- two mountaineering hobos who combine moxie with single mindedness as they climb the world's tallest peaks.  I also enjoyed the chapter detailing early attempts to divine whether or not Everest was really the tallest mountain  -- some of the journeys associated with ascertaining the claims of competing peaks remind one of Scott's Polar expeditions -- fueled more by British resolve than planning and logistics.<br />One wonders at the bent of mind that draws climbers to the highest climbs.  Mountains like Everest and K-2 are littered with well over a hundred corpses (it is to arduous in the thin air and brutal conditions to haul reachable bodies down  -- and impossible for those who tumble a mile off the edge or several hundred feed down a crevasse).  Something like one person perishes for every four who reach the summit of Everest.  A strikingly large number of survivors endure amputations of fingers or toes.  It is the same or worse at some of Nature's other monoliths.<br />This is a sport that makes auto racing and boxing seem like rational athletic endeavors.  One is left to ponder why (perhaps no better answer exists than Mallory's &quot;Because it is there&quot;) some are willing to risk life itself for the privilege of standing ten or so minutes atop one of the tallest mountains.  Krakauer does not pursue this question directly, though the brief character sketches he paints of climbers -- including himself -- offers some conclusions.<br />A fast read and entertaining book.ndred feed down a crevasse).

The archaeological exploration by the National Park Service reveals that the man buried on that bloody field was a Union Lieutenant whose body supposedly rests hundreds of miles away -- under a glorious Monument in a small town in Connecticut that still remembers his devotion in fond memory.<br />The book is a mystery that solves the identity problems of switched Civil War bodies as well as unraveling hundred and forty year old secrets about how the bodies came to be in unexpected places.<br />Lehrer tells the story in two tracks.  The current historical and detective work centers on Dr. Don Spaniel of the National Park Service.  The second track speaks to the reader with a voice from the 1880's in a remembrance of the bloody battle and the weight of events that happened there.  Those events, while giving today's reader a good first hand account of the battle around Burnside's Bridge (Lehrer used the words of real participants), bear directly on Dr. Spaniel's efforts to unravel the mystery of the past.<br />The premise is great -- inspired by occasional findings of whole bodies at Civil War battlefields in recent years.  The voices of the past reverberate with the horror an infantry charge into concealed positions must entail.  The least satisfying part of the book is the present day detective work undertaken by the good Dr. Spaniel and other characters who pop into the story.  I have to agree with one other commenter who thought they were flat and under developed.  I also thought Lehrer had a tendency to have Dr. Spaniel over-react to other characters and occurrences in the story.  This is a thin book, an instance where another forty or so pages could have led to more well-rounded characters -- and perhaps avoided their seemingly convenient popping into the story when needed.<br />Those criticisms noted, it is not a bad story.  In fact, this is an engaging read.  The story does move along quickly and the size of the book makes it an ideal candidate to polish off over a long rainy afternoon.<br />So there it is -- a great premise and an average story.

This book, \\"One For The Road\\" was his first book, written as a 27 year old and about his hitchhiking journey across Australia.<br />The book is thin and narrowly focused in comparison with Horwitz's later work, particularly \\"Confederates\\" and \\"Blue\\".  While these books combine the road trip with the local history and background of related topics, \\"One for the Road\\" is all about the trip.<br />The basics of the book can be summed up as follows:  wait in the hot sun for a ride, get picked up by an Aussie (transplant or Aborigine), drive with the Aussie as they consume tinnies of beer as fast as they can pour it down their gullets, get off at the first pub in the next town to drink, find a place to sleep (often the dirt beside the road).  Repeat 57 times as you wind your way around the continent.<br />While Horwitz's wit and descriptive skills are evident, this is a drinking and travel book.  The people he meets are all pretty much cut out of the same cloth.  Part of the problem is that he often travels to two or three places in each day, leaving little time to reflect or penetrate the continent beyond the confines of the nearest roadside tavern.<br />There are exceptions.  He writes well of Ayer's Rock and the Aborigines who live in it's shadow.  A day spent on a lobster boat in rough seas is also a diversion for both author and reader.  His attempt to find one Jewish person in Broom with whom to share Passover introduces a few Australians whose existence can be described more broadly than by the number of beers they can quaff.  But for the most part, this book plods on as relentlessly as the roads over which he travels.<br />Bill Bryson's journey book of Australia is a much better read, with more varied characters and much more of Australia's interesting history and peccadilloes.<br />This is not a bad book, but I am glad I read Horwitz's latter books first before trying this.latter books first before trying this.	2003-09-16

His specialty is campaign coverage.  Having already done wonderful treatments of Chancellorsville, Antietam and the Peninsula Campaign, Sears now turns his talents to chronicling \\"The\\" Civil War battle (in the eyes of many): Gettysburg.<br />Though others have told this campaign story well (masterfully by Coddington, recently and well by Trudeau), its seminal importance in the outcome and to the memory of the war leaves it always worth the perspective of new authors and generations.<br />Sears has produced a highly readable and detailed telling with his turn.  It is a full history of the campaign, starting in the aftermath of Chancellorsville, the command crisis in the Army of the Potomac, Lee?s decision to go once again North, and ending with the Confederate re-crossing into Virginia in the fortnight after the Battle.  The three days at Gettysburg receives the Sears treatment:  detail enough to satisfy the enthusiast (the fighting is described at brigade and regimental level as well as the big picture) and written in a very engaging style -- well enough to hold the attention of the curious.<br />Sears is not a revisionist.  What this book presents is an opportunity to introduce new readers to the epic that was Gettysburg.  He does explore the command relationships of both Meade and Lee.  Lee comes off somewhat worse than in some tellings I have seen.  The communications and remembrances Sears uses to explore the workings of the Confederate high command reveal Lee's command confidence as lax control of his subordinates and portray Ewell's and Longstreet's efforts to modify Lee's desires as evidence of a lack of decisiveness and knowledge on the part of the Great Southerner.  I don't have a quibble with that analysis, it is supported by the first hand evidence presented by the author.  Longstreet in particular receives a more sympathetic treatment by Sears than he has by some.  His questioning of Lee's July 2nd and 3rd attack directives is presented as the proper interplay between a chief lieutenant and his commander and he does not fault Longstreets's execution when Lee finally decides to send his troops in.<br />Meade comes off very sympathetically, particularly his generalship in the defense and his decision not to make Lee?s mistake of attacking head on a fortified position after Pickett?s Charge or while the Confederates were backed up the Potomac River some ten days after.  Buford, Reynolds and Hancock also are given their proper due, Sickles and Howard their proper criticism.  For 20th Maine fans, Chamberlain?s stand is described in exciting detail, but great credit is also given his brigade commander, the sometimes overlooked Strong Vincent.<br />The only surprise was a minor one:  Stuart's encounter with the 1st Delaware Cavalry at Westminster, MD was omitted.  Others have portrayed this brief engagement as forcing Stuart to lose a day or more and lengthening the time of his separation from Lee's army (thereby leaving Lee blind as to the Union forces against him through most of the battle).  A curious omission, but one that does not detract from an excellent addition to the growing Gettysburg  library.July 2nd and 3rd attack directives is presented as the proper interplay between a chief lieutenant and his commander and he does not fault Longstreets's execution when Lee finally decides to send his troops in.<br />Meade comes off very sympathetically, particularly his generalship in the defense and his decision not to make Lee?s mistake of attacking head on a fortified position after Pickett?s Charge or while the Confederates were backed up the Potomac River some ten days after.

In fact, comparing the ostentatious displays of wealth and brutal no-holds-barred corporate infighting between then (1900) and now, our capitalists sound like mere echoes of men who defined the terms \\"Gilded Age\\" and \\"Robber Barons.\\"<br />Patricia Beard, in \\"After the Ball\\" has used the events and people surrounding the Equitable Life Assurance Society to illustrate a bygone era of business and living at the top level of wealthy society.  In addition to dissecting a nasty takeover corporate takeover attempt well, Ms. Beard writes in a way that holds the reader's attention.<br />The Equitable was one of the big three life insurance companies at the dawn of the 20th Century.  Important to policy holders because life insurance was the only means of support available at the time if the man of the house died with dependants, it was important to Wall Street because the premiums sat in a vast cash pool and were available to finance much of our industrial growth of the period.  The Equitable had been created by one man, Henry Hyde, who grew it from a store-front business to vast size in the forty years after the Civil War.  Henry Hyde was a founder, a decisive man who knew his business, could make decisions and had the respect of his company officers as well as his fellows.<br />His son, James Hazen Hyde, had none of his father's characteristics and had not been schooled by his doting parent in the arts that would be necessary to run the Equitable when it was his turn.  When Henry died, James, in his early twenties, was the product of money and society -- finishing schools in Paris, the best clubs, debutante balls, and the kingly sport of coach riding.  In short, he was trained to compete in the world of Mrs. Astor, not Mr. Astor.<br />To compensate for these deficiencies, father Henry had established a trust for his son.  A vice presidency with the Equitable and the tutelage of James Alexander, President of the company and the man entrusted by the founder to school young James until he could assume the Presidency himself.<br />Alexander had other ideas.  Put off by James Hyde's public and ostentatious lifestyle (including the Hyde Ball, one of the most talked about and over the top dinner productions in an era of societal excess among his class), claiming that it did not befit a corporate leader who could keep the \\"sacred trust\\" of a life insurance company, and wanting control of a company he had contributed mightily to, Alexander organized a takeover fight among the board members.  His goal was to strip James of control of the Board of Directors and to do it by using James' social prominence against him in a public as well as behind-the-scenes attack.<br />What ensued was a year long debacle that quickly spun out of control, as first the Alexander side and then the Hyde forces battled for advantage.  The board members, financiers like Harriman, Ryan, Morgan, Frick and others backed the side that stood to gain them the greatest advantage in victory.  Plans, compromise offers, press leaks, attacks intrigue and back stabbing came forward in a flurry as the fight became very public and enthralled ordinary people (over 100 front page stories in the NY Times in about a year's period).  Regulators soon got involved, the NY Legislature, political bosses and any number of money-men, eyeing easy capital if they could assume control. President Theodore Roosevelt worried that the fight would harm the Equitable, dissolve commercial confidence and bring the economy to a grinding halt.<br />When it was over, neither side got what they wanted or expected, the NY Legislature was spurred into reforming insurance oversight, Charles Evans Hughes was launched on his path to the US Supreme Court and his run for the White House and the Gilded Age (from hindsight) set on a path toward memory.<br />Beard weaves this corporate intrigue with a biography of James Hazen Hyde.  He is the archetypical society man of the Gilded Age, spending on livery, costumed balls, big houses, fast women, a sport very few could even afford to compete in and his love of French culture.  She does a good job of entwining the two threads of her book, stumbling only when she sometimes over-lists what various guests were wearing to various parties and engagements.  On the whole, she does a good job of painting a picture of life as James Hazen Hyde knew it, and demonstrating that he was both cut from too fine a cloth to effectively run a competitive business and that he wore that cloth too proudly, helping to make his lifestyle a large issue in the corporate meltdown that froze the Equitable as titans battled for control.<br />The author writes well and generally keeps the pace moving along swiftly.  The story weaves many famous business and historical personalities (it was a much smaller world at the top then) into the saga of a now forgotten business drama that held the public in fascination.  This is a good book for readers interested in business history as well as viewing the lifestyles of the fabulously wealthy a hundred years ago.ilded Age (from hindsight) set on a path toward memory.<br />Beard weaves this corporate intrigue with a biography of James Hazen Hyde.

999288:US	52882573	R3RT3MW08OP76A	0471003786	940896480	The Power of Gold: The History of an Obsession	Books	3	18	22	N	Y	Interesting Nuggets, But Not 24 Carats	Peter Bernstein has written an overview of the relationship between money and gold throughout the centuries.  This book serves up many interesting stories of gold and its service as money or as a financing instrument.  In this, the book entertains.  However, I found it to be somewhat disjointed as it moved from place to place and time to time chasing the illustrious metal as it assumed its different forms in kingdoms and nations far and wide.<br />My sense after finishing the book was that it was somewhat incomplete -- and that the author could not precisely focus on what the books focus was.  While he mentions the twin uses of gold -- both as money and adornment throughout the book, almost all of the tales and statistics are relating to monetary gold.  Also, for much of the latter half of the book, his focus is on the development of banking and financial instruments -- and their replacement of gold as a medium of exchange and a source of finance.  Perhaps a better title would have been \\"Money through the Ages\\" or something that reflected the breadth of the journey the reader takes while stopping briefly at various historical events involving gold, coin, money, banking, minting and finance.<br />Not to say that the book isn't informative or interesting for the most part -- it is.  I learned many new anecdotes and information from the author -- much of it fascinating.  For example, the \\"Great\\" Kublai Kahn printed money that was backed by his will only, centuries ago.  And it worked; apparently fear of not accepting the Kahn's paper was enough to make it a working medium of exchange.  The Bank of England resisted machine minting with raised edges for years after the technology was available, even though the country was losing a fortune to clippers and shavers of hand stamped coin.  West Africa was long a source of gold to Europe across the Sahara via long camel caravans and in barter on the coast (where the local custom was that Europeans would bring goods they thought appropriate to a place and then leave.  The Africans would then take the goods and leave an amount of gold -- neither side ever seeing the other in the ultimate \\"hand-shake\\" deal).  For centuries, Europe was frustrated in not discovering the location of the mines.  One also reads of the Spanish gold caravans, the California and Klondike Gold Rushes, the era of nations moving gold from one vault to the next in the same New York bank to settle balance of payments and Nixon's abandonment of a gold tie to the dollar in the early 1970's.<br />It is interesting to see how completely wedded to gold some governments became, particularly in the late 1800's early 1900's.  England, and other nations, were willing to see millions become unemployed rather than change the exchange rate - a position that sent Winston Churchill into his period of dormancy in the 1920's.  FDR shocked the establishment - particularly if unsurprisingly Herbert Hoover, by setting gold at $35 dollars and ounce.  In fact, the last third of the book relates story after story of smart men who were thought to absolutely understand the crucial relationship of gold to the money of their nation - and how almost all of them saw their policies produce completely the reverse of what they desired.  For more than 100 years, the money men of Europe and the United States believed an unchangeable gold standard was the only route to growth and prosperity.  The one astute observer, if contrarian, was Benjamin Disraeli, who observed in 1895 that \\"Our gold standard is not the cause, but the consequence of our commercial prosperity.\\"  His observation fell on deaf ears, only to be illustrated as possibly the right relationship after the turmoil of the 1920's and the Great Depression forced countries to begin to unhitch their currencies from absolute and unchanging values as measured in gold.<br />All of the information and stories are somewhat loosely tied together.  Although it is apparent to the reader that the centralpoint to the book is how money developed and gold's role in the various systems, I don't think the author traced the development as well as one might have or drew conclusions that would have made this interesting collection of stories into one story.  Maybe I expected to much from an author who developed the story of insurance and risk better in his work \\"Against the Gods,\\" but I thought this had a more thrown together feel.<br />Most of the information is interesting and even fascinating in some places.  All in all, it is a decent survey of gold, money and the development of finance if one is interested in the topic.point to the book is how money developed and gold's role in the various systems, I don't think the author traced the development as well as one might have or drew conclusions that would have made this interesting collection of stories into one story.

I'd guess that many of the other reviews on this page have the same statement somewhere among their words.<br />McMurtry has written a different kind of western than his classic.  Sin Killer moves very quickly, is a short book and barely develops characters.  In fact, much of their background we learn through dialogue as the story progresses.  McMurtry's other books were long, with character backgrounds, wonderfully written prose that made the books read quickly even at four and five hundred pages.<br />Sin Killer is a scant 300 pages in paperback, much less because the 40-50 chapters often end with 2/3 of a page of white space.  I don't know if McMurtry set out to write more sparsely, but he has succeeded.<br />It is an interesting book and a good read.  The dialogue crackles and McMurtry's gifted story telling skills shine.  Here, the frontier is the Mississippi River, and east of that.  It is the Year of Our Lord 1830, as one of the characters intones repeatedly.  The Berrybenders, landed and rich English aristocracy, have hired a steam wheeler to ply the Missouri so Papa can hunt buffalo and other North American delicacies never before caught in the sights of his European guns.  His large family, large staff, various hirelings and other passengers are out of place on the American frontier -- and therein lies the plot drivers for the story.<br />As the Berrybedners steam north, winter threatens and Indians are always a menace.  Into their self-indulgent lives comes Jim Snow, the Sin Killer.  A young mountain man whose righteousness and ferocity in battle have earned him the respect afforded the ruthless wild places, the Sin Killer is a loner -- until he meets Tasmin Berrybender, Lord Berrybender's eldest daughter.  She is the protagonist of the story and the only one of the English ensemble who -- although as insufferable as the rest of the lot, recognizes the boorishness and haughtiness in herself even while she uses it to devastating effectiveness in getting her way and commanding almost every situation.  Both Tasmin and the Sin Killer have met their matches in each other.  He has found a woman unlike any other who confounds him with her willful ways.  She has found a man who lusts for her without thought of estates, station or status gained and who allows her to jettison completely the air of old Europe which she finds utterly stifling and abhorrent.<br />McMurtry follows the English horde as they plow through the waters of the Missouri and American sensibilities.

It is somewhat misnamed, since the National Debt serves as a background and tie in to each period of fiscal history studied.<br />The author does a superb job of explaining Alexander Hamilton's establishment of our financial, banking, debt and money system.  Here is a woefully under appreciated founder explained succinctly and whose brilliance and indispensability are brought forth by Gordon.<br />Descriptions of attitudes towards and major changes in financial policy and tools follow.  Gordon covers the major aspects:  the struggle over the Second National Bank, Jackson's paying off the debt (the only time the US Gov't has been debt free), Lincoln and Chase's tax, greenback and bond finance of the Civil War, the long fight to establish the income tax, the fight over high marginal rates and an efficient system of taxation, and the change in view in the last century from one that deficits and debt were something to be controlled to our current sorry state of view whereby no one worries about much about deficits anymore.<br />Debt, when properly used, has allowed us to primarily wage wars.  It was retired in times of peace.  We face an interesting time now, when debt as a percentage of GDP is much higher than it has been in most peacetimes.  This raises the question that if we have to fight a truly massive and long war in the future, will we have the capacity to borrow what we need (based on historic statistics, it is a question well worth pondering).<br />Gordon finishes the book with a polemic against the political culture that has lost its way in terms of providing an efficient and fair and economically sound system of taxation and the willingness to moderate the nation's debt.<br />This is a good and interesting book.  Anyone looking for a succinct telling of the development of our government's fiscal structure will appreciate this gem.nd system of taxation and the willingness to moderate the nation's debt.<br />This is a good and interesting book.

This is not a long book, but a series of a half-dozen long magazine type pieces on various topics.<br />Most interesting are writings about the mythology and battles over the memory of Virginia's seminal role in Pickett's Charge.  The author gives a very good account of how Virginia writers monopolized the commentary on this most famous of American infantry advances in the decades following the Civil War until it became perceived as an all-Virginia show.  This produced resentments and compensating analyses in magazine articles from North Carolina veterans and those from other states eventually in an effort to restore some balance to the memory of that fight and rightfully claim their state's share of the southern glory.<br />Longstreet's culpability in the delay surrounding the attack on July 3rd and the issue of whether or not Lee gave him preemptory orders the night before is explored as well as the creation of Longstreet as a whipping boy to magnify Lee's memory in the late 1800's.  Partly due to payback for Longstreet becoming a Republican and accepting patronage from President Grant, and partly due to the need to shield Lee from what could be shown as a gross error in ordering Pickett's attack, Longstreet was the target of a sustained and vitriolic citique of his role at Gettysburg and in the war.  This issue is handled well and presents an interesting monograph on how historic remembrance and war writing can easily turn propagandistic.<br />Less satisfying is the portrait of a Connecticut soldier who helped turn back Longstreet's advance (actually facing North Carolinian troops beyond the turn in the Angle).  The diary entries and the soldier's remembrances of the battle are fascinating.  Less so is that author's analysis and attempt to analyze the soldier's psyche and divine his actions or lack thereof by deconstructing his writing.<br />I also enjoyed a straight-history essay on the pre-Gettysburg careers of Generals Armistead and Garnett.  This presented a good picture of pre-war army service as well as fleshing out the careers and background of two of the major participants in Pickett's Charge.  (Ironically, Garnett fathered -- and acknowledged -- a son with an Indian woman, but had no problem fighting for a South that viewed humanity through the lens of racial class)<br />The Army of the Potomac's pursuit of Lee to the Potomac River and Lee's escape in the fortnight after the battle is also examined.  The author does a good job of exploring the question of whether or not Meade should have counterattacked on July 3rd, examining the apparent slow pace of the pursuit, Halleck's attempt at exhortation and the not-fought \\"Battle of Falling Waters\\" in attempting to bring more clarity to age old questions.<br />All in all this is an interesting book that should please the Gettysburg fan.mpt to analyze the soldier's psyche and divine his actions or lack thereof by deconstructing his writing.<br />I also enjoyed a straight-history essay on the pre-Gettysburg careers of Generals Armistead and Garnett.

Fortune appears in the form of a mysterious stranger who offers the lawyer more money than he could make in a lifetime defending poor criminals.  The source of his new wealth:  mass tort cases handed up on a silver platter if our attorney will settle with the families of murder victims whose murdered loved one was the unfortunate side effect of a new wonder being secretly tested in drug clinics around the world.<br />The young attorney accepts, holds his nose and settles the suits and becomes the new &quot;King of Torts,&quot; as his success suing his first drug company catapults him into the front ranks of the country's trial attorneys.<br />His untold riches finance cars, planes, a beautiful consort, a national profile and the burying of his conscience.  In the end, his world collapses when he reaches for a \\"case to far\\" and the FBI catches up with him for short selling the stock of a company against which he was about to file a class action suit.<br />Riches gone, he wins back his girl (who finally decides that a wad of cash borne by the wrong suitor might be a worse deal than the right suitor whose only credit is his newly rediscovered character).  They then ride off into the sunrise (east from Washington DC to a flat in London).<br />This novel has some of the character development of the standard Grisham fare, though it pales besides some of his earlier work.  The action is fast paced, and some of the early sub plots are interesting -- particularly the conspiracy with the original bad drug.  His portrayal of the Mass Tort Trial Attorney world fascinates - particularly his Patton French character - the granddaddy of mass tort actions and a caricature of greedy lawyers at the top of their game.  What this book is mostly is a morality tale on two levels.  First, the evil of a legal system which allows mass tort trial lawyers to decimate companies good and bad with the no-holds-barred fee system that currently exists.  Second, the evil effect of quick and ill-earned wealth on the character of otherwise normal people. (one quote from the book:  \\"nobody, nobody earns six million dollars in six months\\")<br />This book is interesting and a quick read.  I thought the ending was not as calculated and dependent on the earlier story as has been the case in previous efforts -- it just kind of happened and was declared by the author.  All in all, a middling effort from Grisham; still a good read because he is one of the best popular novelists around.ort Trial Attorney world fascinates - particularly his Patton French character - the granddaddy of mass tort actions and a caricature of greedy lawyers at the top of their game.

It is interesting that this author can retain his appeal across mediums -- he is known as a witty travel writer and has also produced fun and intelligent books on the history of the English language.  Now, he goes far afield and explains natural philosophy, as the sciences were once called, in a way that textbooks have avoided ever since there have been science textbooks.<br />Bryson tackles space, the origins of the universe, geology, the formation of the Earth, physics, the beginning and development of life, cells, DNA and humans in this natural world round-up.  Each chapter follows a similar format.  A fascinating tidbit is introduced to draw the reader in, the history of understanding in each field is discussed and the evolution of thinking to the current state of understanding explained.  This format is enlivened by the personalities past and present (including science's crackpots, iconoclasts and geniuses).<br />Besides the Bryson wit, what makes this a phenomenally good read is the author's ability to relate scientific principles with examples that laymen can understand and that clarify often confusing scientific knowledge and theories.<br />For example, I was floored to learn that our solar system is so vast, that it literally could not be drawn to scale on any size in a meaningful way.  Neptune is five times farther from Jupiter than Jupiter is from Earth.  On a scale drawing with Earth the size of a pea, Jupiter would be a thousand feet away and Pluto a mile and a half (and the size of a bacterium).  Now that illustrates space in our immediate environs better than I've every seen it described before.<br />What is the largest concentration of magma waiting to blow? (and possibly blow us out of existence)  It's under Yellowstone National Park.  Ten percent of the weight of a six year old pillow is dead skin flakes, mites and mite dung.  Most physicists think Einstein wasted the second half of his life pursuing a unified theory instead of thinking about other useful things.  Every human cell contains DNA strands that are six feet long if laid end to end.  The core of the Earth is as hot as the surface of the sun - and solid because of the immense pressure compacting that mass.  Only three percent of the Earth's water is fresh, and almost all of this is in ice sheets - only a scanty .03% of the total is available to us a fresh, flowing water.<br />Interesting tidbits like the above abound.  So do dire stories about past volcanic activity, changes in magnetism, changes in atmospheric conditions and asteroid impacts that have periodically befell Earth and helped move species development forward (usually by wiping out most species existing at the time).  Could they/ would they happen in the future?  Sure.  However, the scale of time over which the next cataclysmic event may occur could be so far removed that we will have evolved into something else (or have found a way to blow up or steer threatening asteroids out of our way).<br />This book fascinates and amuses.  If science textbooks had a bit of this ability to relate and engage during my time in school, I'd bet today there would be a lot more scientists working to figure out the remaining mysteries of our world.ng to blow?

It was a devastating defeat for the British, specifically &quot;Bloody Tarleton,&quot; whose British Legion had been the scourge of the Carolinas.  The defeat was so total because of the Masterful plan and seamless execution by General Morgan and his subordinates.  Too few Americans know about Cowpens and its place in steering Cornwallis ultimately to Yorktown.<br />The author had a mission:  to dissect the Battle of Cowpens through pension records of participants and memoirs in order to construct an accurate placement of troops during the battle, the size of American forces present, the total of British casualties and the duration of the affair.<br />He has done his work well and convincingly.  In the process, Babits clarifies and rectifies some commonly held notions of Cowpens.  The militia line made an orderly retreat through the Main line through previously established gaps in that line and not around the flank; Morgan's troop totals and casualties in his report were only for Continental troops -- the militia doubled Morgan's probable force to 1800 men engaged; Washington did not encounter Tarleton at the end of the battle but three British cavalry officers; the South Carolina militia did not cross the field during their planned withdrawal; the North Carolina militia stayed in the fight on the American right after their planned withdrawal.<br />If these details have lost you, it focuses on a major facet of the book.  It is for readers who have some appreciation of the Revolution in the South and the Battle of Cowpens.  While thoroughly researched and minutely written, my one criticism is that at times the author gets bogged down in details that interrupt the flow of the larger story.  Thus the book may seem inaccessible to a first timer looking to find out about the Battle of Cowpens.<br />Not that the author doesn't tell the battle story in full.  He does.  This book underscores General Daniel Morgan's tactical brilliance as well as General Greene's strategic insight in detailing Morgan to the interior initially.  Morgan's battlefield plan and his sub commander's (particularly William Washington and John Howard's) performances are correctly studies in leadership and execution.  Morgan planned a tactical masterpiece that made use of all his troops' strengths and used some of their weaknesses (in the case of the militia) to his advantage.  American arms have seldom exceeded this level of performance at the tactical level.<br />(Delaware partisan warning here)  The author also highlights the rock steady performance of Captain Kirkwood and his Delaware Line during the battle and the pursuit of Tarleton.  Kirkwood was one of the best Continental battlefield leaders of the war, noticed by George Washington as well as a host of others.  Prohibited from rising to General by the virtue of his coming from a small state (the number of state troops raised had much to do with the general offices available), Kirkwood and his Delawares (as the author describes them; today we say Delawareans, although I'm not sure if that was the case 225 years ago) were a mainstay in Morgan's line, absorbing the direct fire of the main British regiment and receiving the most unit casualties of any of Morgan's forces.  I was very glad to see Babit give this small band of Blue Hens their due.<br />This is a very good book in terms of research and analysis.

A wagoneer in Gen. Braddock's Expedition, Morgan endured 400 lashes after tangling with a British soldier (he claimed only 399 and loved to regale listeners with the fact that he still owed the British one miscounted lash).<br />His physical endurance and prowess was combined with the ability to lead men and a superior ability to plan and manage battlefield tactics.  He has been described as one of the Revolution's best battlefield commanders and this book gives plenty of examples to support that claim.<br />Morgan's service to our Republic was remarkable.  Although a failure, his part in the Quebec expedition helped make possible one of the most grueling campaigns military history.  Traveling overland through the spine of backwoods Maine, Morgan helped lead outnumbered American forces to a wintry showdown that could have produced a fourteenth colony in revolt against the Crown.  In fact, Morgan stood at the moment of victory; had his desire to keep driving into the city after breaching its under-defended backside been followed, the city could have been captured.  As it was, hesitancy on the part of other American commanders led to defeat and Morgan's capture.  He had to endure a period of imprisonment until paroled.<br />That parole was a costly one for the British.  It allowed Morgan, when exchanged, to play his decisive roles at Saratoga and Cowpens.<br />Morgan's ability to lead riflemen and read the battlefield was crucial to Gate's success at Saratoga (which led to French recognition, support and the resources to chance complete independence).  Morgan's later brilliance at Cowpens, site of the famed double envelopment of Tarleton's British Legion, led to the series of events that ended with Cornwallis being pinned against the James at Yorktown.  Cowpens, arguably the most decisive American victory of the war, was brilliant.  Morgan, as the American commander, threaded strategic understanding, leadership (he had to persuade bayonetless American militia that they had a crucial role to fulfill in the battle and would be allowed to retire once fulfilling it), battlefield planning and tactical control to produce a victory that is rightly studied to this day.<br />A character, Morgan is one of the men who made the Revolution a success.

It is a wonderful mixture of prose and fact, using Franklins's own words to help illustrate a wonderfully readable story.<br />Franklin's many interests and his indefatigable nature are so rich that a seven or eight volume biography organized along his separate endeavors would be possible.  He was a businessman, a publisher, a highly readable and widely read author; a scientist and experimenter; a civic leader and organizer, a politician, diplomat, Founder and revolutionary.  Remarkably, he found success and satisfaction from all, failing only as a family man and father.<br />Brands does not explicitly explore whether or not Franklin's many interests simply crowded out his ability to be a devoted husband and father, or whether the single-mindedness and vanity that helped propel him to greatness left him immune to the needs of those immediately around him.  The struggles of his wife and son make an interesting counterpoint to the many successes enjoyed by this remarkable man.<br />Brands weaves all these Franklins in this chronological exploration of his life.  Franklin's interests are so varied and his energy so great that he reminds one of Teddy Roosevelt in the breadth and impact of his accomplishments.  Indeed, Brands has written of both and I suspect he sees great similarities between them and great symmetry in the life of a man who made America possible and the life of a man who one hundred years later remade America.<br />Franklin is remembered and rightly so.  His service to independence was critical in both helping gain the Declaration and in helping win French recognition (though one needs to recognize that ultimately France waded in on our side because it was in her interests to prick her longtime antagonist England and support for America represented a relatively safe and inexpensive way to do so).  His aphorisms to this day help capture truisms of right living.  Most know Franklin.

This is an interesting (mostly) survey of America's reaction to the passing of the Revolutionary generation around the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.<br />The author focuses on 10 or so personalities great and small to paint a picture of how America reflected the glory and promise of the Revolution through nostalgia, politics, arts and letters.<br />We see LaFayette on his triumphant return tour to America as the last living connection to the military high command that won our freedom.  This description I found fascinating as the old general visited the sons and daughters of his contemporaries (and a few remaining in their own right such as Adams and Jefferson).<br />Wiley Henry Clay, destiny's child Andrew Jackson and the unfortunate John Quincy Adams all make their appearance as they dominated the stage during the mid-1820's.  America's canal boom is described, particularly as it crisscrossed Ohio, a state transformed as water highways joined New England, the Great Lakes economy and the lower Mississippi within its borders.<br />The quintessentially American drama of Jefferson and Adams expiring on the same day, the exact date of the 50th anniversary of the Declaration, and their famous correspondence is explored.  Here the author is able to capture some of the magic and \\"smile of providence\\" that from time to time has seemed to settle on America.  The effect of simultaneous death that these two brothers of independence (who were to leave that state of grace as fierce political enemies only to make up and join forces for to the benefit of posterity through their rediscovered admiration late in life) was great on our still young nation.  The author recounts well the glow that settled on the nation upon discovering that Adams and Jefferson had been called back to their creator together on the anniversary of their great historical moment.<br />We also learn of the wife of a Massachusetts minister and the ambitious attorney general -- both authors of the time -- as they contemplate the glory of the revolution through popular writings.<br />This book is a survey -- disjointed and with a lot of background information not necessarily focused on the Year of Jubilee.  Its strong points are the fascinating vignettes like Lafayette's tour, the Jefferson-Adams passing and President J.Q. Adams's troubled administration.  Weaker, in my opinion, were digression and dissections of the romantic writing of the two authors.  Our author dissected their work in a literary analysis that struck me as overdone and not in keeping with the flow of the rest of the book.<br />Perhaps this book would have been more accurately described as a snapshot of America as it approached its Jubilee rather than as the story of how America celebrated the event.  As a survey it has many interesting chapters and the focus on a time immediately following the \\"Era of Good Feelings\\" gives some depth to a period often glossed over in other histories.

Rawicz (the officer) is tortured in the Soviet prison system and sent to the Gulags.  Faced with misery in Siberia and probable death, he and a band of others escape and undertake a two thousand-mile long journey from the snows of Siberia through Mongolia, the Gobi Desert, and across the Himalayas toward British India and freedom.<br />This is a great story.  The author describes the mindless torture under the Soviet system in a manner that should persuade any reader of the evil of totalitarianism.  The description of his train journey, hundred-mile winter hike through a Siberian winter to his gulag and life in the camp is fascinating.  His will to survive amidst degradation, the elements and overwhelming odds are a testament to the human thirst for freedom and liberty.<br />As other reviewers have stated, there are some parts of the book that invite skepticism.  His befriending by the camp commandant's wife seems as improbable as it is crucial to his ability to escape.  The escapees journey across the Gobi Desert where his group went for many days without water beyond what I understood a person could tolerate.  Without any climbing tools, his party went across the Himalayas to India -- a feat that seems fantastic.  Also his brief description of spotting what could only be described as the elusive Yetti in the Himalayas stretches credibility (unless it does actually exist).<br />That being said, this story is exhilarating and I found it believable and enthralling.  It is a wonderful adventure story and describes the limits of what the human spirit and mind can endure to survive in freedom.  This book has been around for almost fifty years and was given wide play when first introduced.

It is somewhat marred by the author's absolutism in arguing his main thesis that warfare against civilians (terrorism) is always a losing strategy for the perpetrators.  His secondary thesis is that surgical, preemptive strikes have been consistently the most effective way of eliminating terrorist threats (all the more interesting since Carr wrote this book before the Iraq War).<br />Caleb Carr looks at history from Roman times to the current Arab-Israeli conflict to argue that terrorism always loses.  Terrorism, or attacks on civilians, differs from guerilla warfare in that guerillas use their irregular forces and tactics to target opposing/occupying military personnel and targets.  Terrorists just kill and maim wantonly, under the mistaken belief that carnage and death will force change or lead the terrorists to their goals.  The historic evidence is otherwise.  Terrorism almost always hardens the hearts and steels the minds of both targets and local populations against the perpetrators and frequently begets terrorism as a response.<br />Carr's examples are many.  The Romans struck not the military might of the German tribes across the Rhine, but the villages and peoples thereof.  German tribes became ferocious opponents and were the ones who ended up sacking Rome.  Michael Collins was on his way to winning independence for all of Ireland.  His turn to terrorism stiffened British resolve (leading one British prime minister to state he would not conclude a deal with the IRA because he \\"would not shake hands with murder.\\") and undercut his local support.  Palestinian terrorism has not shaken the resolve of Israel; it has produced hard line Israeli governments less likely to negotiate Palestinian autonomy or statehood.  These are a few of the historic examples Carr cites in support of his argument.<br />While I think he is generally right, he mars his well argued position by stating that warring against civilians and non-military targets always loses.  Certainly the American Indian experience shows that wars of annihilation can sometimes (obviously) reduce an opponent to absolute subjugation for the long-term.  And while Rome was sacked by the descendants of tribesman who sufferings were legion along the Rhine, several hundred years elapsed from then until Rome's fall.  Also, General Sherman's romp through Georgia is referred to several times, but America healed fairly well and fairly quickly after the Civil War.<br />Nevertheless, the author's failed attempt to prove his observation correct in every case does not mar this book's demonstration that his thesis stands up well in most cases.  On the contrary, the evidence marshaled by Carr is persuasive and the conclusion convincing.<br />Carr also shows what has worked historically in dealing with perpetrators of terrorism.  Preemptive war, surgical strikes, leadership strikes have all proven the most consistently successful means to deal with history's bad actors.  The reason is simple.  Responding to terrorism with terrorism creates nations of opponents among people who generally want to live in peace and are probably suffering under their terrorist leader, warlord, or ruthless tyrant and would like nothing more than to see that person removed.  As Jefferson showed in dismantling the Barbary pirates (at least as a threat against American interests) and President Bush has just shown against Saddam, the surgical strike first articulated by Frederick the Great removes the problem by attacking leadership and military interests without killing so many civilians that a nation of revenge seekers is created.<br />Failing to act preemptively begets larger threats over time.  The suffering nation is perceived as weak (terrorists and tyrants look to prey on the weak) and the threat grows.  The recent evidence of this progression can be seen in the mid to late 1990's as American embassies, interests, and the USS Cole were progressively attacked by Islamic terrorists who came to believe that America's only response to such outrages would be a few cruise missiles thrown against desert encampments.  As unseemly as preemptive war seems to Americans, it is certainly better than the alternative of massive casualties inflicted upon us by those who come to believe they can act with impunity because we are not willing to persecute these threats until they are eliminated.<br />This is an interesting and persuasive book that should be read by every member of Congress as well as all that want to know how to best protect America in this age of terrorism.ly attacked by Islamic terrorists who came to believe that America's only response to such outrages would be a few cruise missiles thrown against desert encampments.

The author is to the point and without the invective that mars some otherwise worthwhile conservative tomes.  He makes very good use of example, drawing on many anecdotes and documented recent history to expose the shallowness of many liberals and liberal positions, at least at the national level.<br />The anecdotes and examples are what gives the book its power.  Citing the 9th Circuit Federal Court's decision to stop the Pledge of Allegiance, Tom Daschell's changing positions on issues to fit the party in control of the White House, a host of Democrat presidential candidate's change of heart (probably a bad metaphor on this issue) on abortion to suite their national aspirations, and Congressional assault on American intelligence and defense agencies in the 1970's, give credence to his view that much of liberal policy and action are either wrong-headed or entirely cynical.<br />This is a quick book whose meat is with Hannity's documentation of his charges and point of view.  Wrapped around this is Hannity's personal story and emergence as a conservative voice.<br />The book's weakness is that sometimes Hannity makes bald assertions and generalizations, and doesn't always back them up with facts.  I don't have any difficulty agreeing with the author and most of his assertions because I've spent a lot of time studying the same issues.  But someone who is erudite but not studied might think the book is too thin in some of its charges.  On the other hand, this book is probably perfectly written for those seeking to buttress their strong conservative beliefs with some facts and history.<br />All in all, a good effort among the growing list of popular conservative books.	2003-04-04

This adventure's sidekick, Roger, is an affable foil for Horwitz and provides some of the book's lighter moments. Roger embraces the mission, but also the chance to go &quot;crumpeting&quot; around polynesia with his ever present bottle in tow. His &quot;funster&quot; role does grow to approximate the author's appreciation for Captain Cook by the end of the book and serves as a merry distraction throughout.<br />Four or so pages of Tony and Roger exploring Cook's old haunts are followed by four or so pages describing Cook's life and journeys. This interspersion continues throughout the book and works well. This organization keeps the focus on the imprint Cook's visits had on native people and their cultures as well as providing for a light easy to read format.<br />Horwitz begins his quest by signing up for a week cruise in a replica of the Endeavor (Cook's first ship) as it plies windy and tossed seas off the Pacific Northwest. Armed with this touch of experience, he and his pal mostly jet to Hawaii, Tonga, New Zealand, Australia, the Aleutian Islands - \\"boldly going where Captain Cook has gone before&quot; as the sub title states.<br />The inevitable conclusion one draws from Cook's visits is that a series of insular cultures did not survive well or long first contact with Europeans. Most islands today have a fraction or less of the native population that hosted Captain Cook. Disease, manipulation, the sudden imposition a material culture and avarice produced their predictable results. Horwitz does not blame Cook, for if not him some other wind born adventurer would have brought the same calling card within a few years. Cook was actually enlightened in his attitudes towards crew welfare and obligations towards natives. The author only tells the story of change and contact with Cook did bring change -- on a massive scale.<br />This is an engaging and entertaining book. Though not a full biography of Cook or a detailed telling of his three voyages, it gives an excellent overview of the man and his legacy.

Setting out from Independence, Mo., Parkman proceeded to Ft. Larime (Wyoming), spent many weeks with a band of Indians as they hunted buffalo and secured life's necessities for the coming season, and returned to &quot;the settlements&quot; via Bent's Fort (Colorado) and the upper Santa Fe Trail.  (Making this wonderful book misnamed since he was only on about the first 1/3 of the Oregon Trail and never crossed the Rockies).<br />What Parkman has left us is a wonderfully descriptive first person account of overland travel in the rugged west and the life of the Indian (as viewed by an outsider).<br />The strength of this book is in the details.  Parkman has a keen eye whether it is turned towards imposing landscapes, Indian village life and travel, or buffalo hunting.  This book has a gritty feel that paints the grandeur of western vistas as well as the hard reality of subsistence life (both Indian and white traveler) lived outdoors in a frequently unforgiving land.<br />Parkman's voice does have a 19th century feel.  Modern readers will find he over-introduces new subjects (ie, &quot;since, reader, we are telling of a buffalo hunt, now is a good time to acquaint you with the manner in which buffalo are brought to ground.&quot;) and the book does not have the flow associated with more contemporary writing.  His attitudes towards Indians reflect the majority view of that time period and he was certainly at times a gratuitous hunter.<br />But the book's descriptive power, as well as the fascinating telling of life among the Indians and on the plains makes this well worth the time.

That is not to say that some of the criticisms on this page are not correct -- this book is less dependent on plot than earlier Grishom novels.<br />Rather, this book emphasizes characters and place setting descriptions.  These the author handles well, turning once again a small southern town and its inhabitants into interesting components of an enjoyable escapist novel.<br />The story:  two brothers are summoned back by their stern father, a judge both hardly knew in any fatherly sense.  Dad is dead by the time the sensible son (law professor) arrives.  Sensible son finds $3 million in cash cached in dad's study.  This he hides, due to:  the startling amount (dad barely earned any money the last nine years and never more than $50 thousand a year on the bench); the fact that younger brother is a dysfunctional druggie and alcoholic who would surely kill himself if those types of resources were available, and the fact that younger brother is late, as usual.<br />The book's \\"who dun-it\\" revolves around where the money came from and sensible brother's increasing entanglement his own secret.<br />The pace is somewhat slow in terms of his other books, but I found the descriptions of the characters (there are many more than the main protagonists above) fascinating and the background stories well crafted.  Although this book has plot twists driven largely by recently introduced facts and new characters (in other words, the twists and turns are not dependent upon information present at the start of the story), I found it held my attention.<br />This may not be one of Grishom's most creative and tied together efforts, but I found it a fine book and just the thing to use to pleasantly wile away a rainy Saturday.  Good escapism.	2003-04-04

Willimon's book does great justice to the founding principals of Methodism and fills in the gaps for those of us (most, I would hazard) who are not sure how Methodists differ from the half-dozen other \\"Main-Line\\" Protestant denominations.<br />Willimon focuses on the vision and passion of John Wesley, Methodism's founder.  Wesley was a true thinker on religious issues, and his views on grace, the primacy of scripture, the role of good works in a Christian life and the route to salvation represented a real break with Anglicanism as practiced in his time -- (though he remained an Anglican and thought of himself as a reformer of that denomination).  His guidance and thoughts dominated the early Methodist movement and are very helpful for contemporary Methodists to understand.  The author does an outstanding job of bringing Wesley's theological and practice thoughts to life.<br />Where I personally thought the book was a little weak, was in discussing organized Methodism's infatuation with social policy and legislation over the last several decades.  Methodists have a long and honorable history of working to end slavery, feed the poor, nourish the souls of those imprisoned and generally alleviate human misery.  Willimon gives just due to this enviable record.  More recently, however, the Methodist church leadership has embraced an activist legislative agenda that reads more like that of a political party instead of a God mission (and it's not a conservative political party they sound like!).  This controversy is touched on briefly by the author in his chapter on works.  He fails to demonstrate how current Methodist leadership's determination to have positions on many side issues (did you know the church is \\"for\\" ratifying the 1973 \\"Law of the Sea\\" treaty?), springs from Wesley's tireless efforts to improve the basic physical and moral lot of his fellow beings.  In fact, the author somewhat embarrassingly acknowledges the Church's difficulty with reconciling its activism with it's original mission.  He quotes one practicing Methodist infuriated by some of the Church's foray's into public policy as saying \\"at least this church makes me think.\\"<br />This is a real issue for United Methodists, one which has spawned several \\"back to basic\\" reform movements within the church and is responsible for making available some new members to the Baptist and independent churches that are in ascendancy in America today.  I think the author brushed by these controversies in order to keep focused on the first principals of Methodism -- a vision that is truly inspiring and comfortable to those of us making our faith journey in this denomination.<br />However, this digression and criticism does not underscore the value of the author's book.  I suspect there are many, many Methodists wondering about what we stand for, what our founding principals are and how we differ from other protestant denominations.

While some interesting aspects of church history may strike the reader as covered briefly, this is necessary to discuss all the major facets of a 2,000 year old institution.  Helpfully, the author includes four or five &quot;For Further Reading&quot; suggestions at the end of each chapter so those who want to plumb the depths of various topics have somewhere to go.<br />This book is scholarly without being pedantic and unbiased without being unfaithful to the centrality of Christ's life and divinity as the bedrock of all the Christian churches. From reading the text, I could not discern whether the author is a Catholic or Protestant -- he does a good job of describing their histories and conflicts without taking sides.<br />It is all here.  The early church story is described well -- a period that I have found give short shrift in other histories of the church.  The growth of the church from a spiritual movement of the outback of the Roman empire to state religion and preeminent institution is a fascinating story that is told well and succinctly.  The growth of the nation state and the resulting conflict with Christendom and the Reformation and organized religion's struggle with modernity round out the second half of the book.  Finally, the book describes current Christianity -- it's growth as a world movement in Africa and South America and some of the very recent aspects of Church Christianity in America (tele-evangelism, Billy Graham, secularization, etc.) end the book.<br />This book is a fascinating overview of Church History -- &quot;In Plain Language&quot; as advertised.	2003-02-18

This is an excellent thriller, made more gripping because it is true.<br />This is the story of Pablo Escobar, a viscious, pathalogical sociopath who put these dark tendencies to work in building the Medillin cocaine cartel over the 1970's and 1980's. Author Bowden tells Escobar's story, describes the building of his empire, portrays his success at utterly corrupting Colombia's government during the 1980's and engagingly unfolds the ultimately successful effort of Columbian patriots and agencies of our government to hunt down and eliminate a very evil man.<br />Escobar corrupted his government, as well as significant sections of Colombian society. His drive was not only to control the cocaine industry, but also to elevate himself to a man of destiny in his country's affairs. His ruthlessness took the form of bombings, murders, torture and kidnappings. These crimes included at least one jet airliner bombed in the sky and the assassination of presidential candidates, judges, other officials and hundreds of police.<br />Alternating between conciliation -- anything to make the terror stop -- and a desire to rid itself of the man who was making a mockery of Columbian democracy, the government ultimately was pushed by Escobar's continuing bloodletting to ruthlessly hunt him down. Our government was a critical player in the hunt as well as in steeling the Columbian government to hold this course.<br />The final hunt and elimination of Escobar was brutal and bloody on both sides. Escobar continued to attempt elimination and terror bombings of rivals and governmental officials. The government, as well as a government sponsored militia, employed equally brutal methods, targeting Escobar's associates and cartel workers for assassination and looking the other way at bombings of Escobar's various homes and properties and the killing of his relatives.  In the end, Escobar was cornered and died in a shoot out with police (and possibly US military personnel, according to the author).<br />This is a fast paced, shocking and very interesting book. It is written in the style of a long magazine article -- which keeps the narrative pace lively. For those of us used to a generally stable society, the utter lawlessness and corruption of Columbian government and large sections of its society is astounding.<br />Perhaps most interesting, this book is a long case study of whether or not the ends justify the means. Escobar's final destruction was only -- and apparently could only be -- accomplished by extra-legal means as brutal as those committed by his forces. He killed and bombed. The government sponsored militia and police killed Escobar's lieutenants and bombed his homes and properties. It was terror for terror that arguably yielded a good end but was accomplished outside of the law, morality or any sense of constraint. And, our government was key in providing the resources (technical and human) as well as the steel needed by Columbia's government to pursue Escobar to his death.<br />Arguably, had the government stuck to the law, Escobar would be stronger than ever today, perhaps the ruler of Columbia. So total was his corruption of government. This book is great fodder for discussion of how far one can go in pursuing a just end.  The book itself does not attempt to ask this question or provide an answer.  The question is, however, inescapable to the reader, and looms over every deed done to contain the evil represented by the man.<br />The book is fast paced, very well researched, filled with first person accounts and well written.

By definition, collections tend to be up and down experiences as one moves from interesting stories told by skilled tellers to flat ideas leveled even more by mediocre writers.<br />Happily, this book is mostly hills instead of valleys.  Men's Journal, the magazine, has collected feature articles from their first ten year's of existence.  As the title suggests, this is largely a book about men, from men's perspectives and oriented toward adventure and action.<br />The authors vary from P.J. O'Rourke to Sebastain Junger.  Most of the tales they tell are marvelous and well written.  I would estimate that three-quarters of the articles were either fascinating stories, extremely well written or happily, a combination of both.<br />This book takes the reader around the world.  A sampling:  a river journey up the dark reaches of the Amazon by two teen-agers raised to embrace the bohemian experience; minimalist camping and fishing in Patagonia; ascension of the famed Mt. Eiger; an otherworldly road trip across India's central thorofare; hiking and death in the Punjab, the late 1990's trek to the top of Mt. Everest that took a dozen lives; living on the run with several of the world's guerilla leaders.<br />While most of these stories involve maximum testosterone and roughing it in the outdoors, some surprising gems describe men's domestic tranquility.  I particularly enjoyed one story of a man's family retreat on the northern shores of Lake Superior and how that get-a-way came to define his family's experiences and his better memories.<br />There are a few clunkers out of 40 or so stories, but overall this book is a good read.	2003-01-24

Or, the perfect bathroom book.<br />Man, or at least some number of the 6 billion of us, is often stupid.  Often that stupidity results in death.  This book is a collection of short news accounts, anecdotes and descriptions of stupidity leading to death.  The reader gets everything from six Egyptians going down a water well after a chicken (only the chicken didn't drown); a man who used a lighter to see if any gasoline was left in a gas can; a man who used the same source of illumination to check for a charge through the business end of a shotgun; a Delawarean consumed by his own pet boa constrictor; and, other senseless ways in which, according to the author, \\"the stupidist of us have improved the gene pool by removing themselves from it.\\"  Hence the title \\"Darwin Awards.\\"<br />Some problems with this book for me:  There is very little narrative and what little there is tends to be repetitive on the \\"Darwin\\" angle and sophomoric, and; the author includes \\"urban legends\\" which may be interesting but probably aren't true.<br />Some of these tales of ignorance and stupidity do astound and amaze (a few are genuinely sad).  But, this is a list of news clippings or internet sources, each discrete and unaffiliated with what comes before or after.  As such, I enjoyed it most in short bursts as a \\"filler\\" book.	2003-01-24

In those moments, this book sometimes grates -- the same voice that illuminates follies with instant cereal advertising and electric tooth brushes sounds somewhat tinny applied against what was a great undertaking.<br />Fortunately for this book, those moments are few enough that an interesting picture of the war as seen through Rooney's eyes is not subsumed with his sarcasm and general crankiness. In fact, he keeps those traits generally in check in what reads like an honest look at his service as a front line reporter during the war in Europe.<br />Rooney's book \\"My War\\" is a collection of anecdotes. Fortunately, his travels over German skies in American B-17's, with advancing armor and infantry in France and Germany and to newly (as in a few hours ago) liberated nazi work and concentration camps makes for fascinating anecdotes.<br />A sergeant in rank, Rooney was afforded the opportunity to meet with personalities and troops of all ranks as he covered the war for what I am sure was the largest circulation American daily newspaper during the early 1940's. His travel made great anecdotes and good stories.<br />Rooney is poignant in this book. He has a great reverence for lives lost and is very honest about himself and his changing appreciation for war as a sometimes necessary thing (he entered the war with the words \\"any peace is better than any war\\" from a college professor ringing in his ears and came to learn after reflecting upon Nazi warfare that \\"any peace is not better than any war\\"). This book is somewhat a chronicle of Rooney's maturation as well as his war stories.<br />The stories are for the most part entertaining and worth reading.

This material is the stuff of exciting history and the author's accounts of Jackson's brawls, scrapes, wars and political fights make for great reading.  Remini also does a good job of pointing out the contradictions that formed Jackson's personal and political personae, and explaining how this most unique of Americans came to dominate the politics of his time by greatly changing the idea of the presidency.<br />Jackson's rise was improbable.  Orphaned as a teen and possessing all the faults of a frontier hothead, he managed to apprentice himself to a lawyer and took himself and his profession to the wild American west - Tennessee.  In a milieu where aggressiveness and action were more highly valued than process and rules, Jackson quickly assumed the role of one of the leaders of this new territory.  From the beginning, Jackson's political acuity was in evidence as he aligned himself with one of the two major factions in Tennessee.  This gave him the opportunity to receive the patronage and position that a talented man like himself would build into a most impressive career.<br />Jackson the military man was a daring and impressive strategist.  His \\"move and hit\\" dictum set him apart from many generals of his day and won laurels in the Creek War and in helping to relieve Spain of Florida.  His sophistication as a military leader was revealed during his masterful defeat of the British before New Orleans.  Jackson took a defensive position for the first time in his military career and allowed the British onslaught to waste itself against his line and batteries.  He resisted the possibility of sallying forth when the first British units arrived before him and after what was obviously a crushing repulse of the British army after the battle.  His patience won America new respect around the world and ended on a high note a war that had seen America's new capitol city sacked.<br />With that signal victory, Jackson possessed a reputation and stature that led him to the White House.  His administration literally swept into power, redefining America in terms of policy with the elimination of the national bank and the government's debt and in terms of personnel with his \\"rotation in office\\" philosophy (more popularly and properly known as the \\"Spoils system.\\")  His most signal achievement in office was to make the Presidency for the first time the preeminent branch of US government.  Jackson was the first president to use the veto on policy grounds -- prior presidents had issued just eight vetoes and only when they thought acts of Congress were unconstitutional.  Jackson used the veto to make the president a legislative force in his own right, forever changing the nature of policy and law making in the United States.<br />The book wonderfully chronicles Jackson's political struggles and the issues created and faced by his administration: nullification, tariff, Bank of the United States, and foreign policy to name a few.<br />More than just a good story, Remini uses the fascinating acts of Jackson's life to explain his perspective, political philosophy and moral guideposts in remaking America during his time.<br />I was glad the author produced this 400-page abridgement of his massive three volume Jackson study.  It's a very good work that balances nicely between major events and analysis.  The only hint that this is an abridgement is that the author occasionally repeats declarative sentences within a few paragraphs of each other.  I suspect in his larger work these statements were separated by pages instead of paragraphs and functioned as an appropriate introduction and summary to a facet of the story the author was exploring.  A minor quibble and the only reminder that this is a re-write.  Otherwise, Remini's style is very readable and makes this important study a joy to read.able and makes this important study a joy to read.	2002-12-30

But it is interesting in a reflective and anecdotal way.  Larry McMurtry wrote about engaging in one of his passions -- long drives across America on our big roads. His purpose was to recapture some of his nostalgia for moving on roads that age and a recent major operation had whittled away.<br />The result is this slim book about Larry driving and thinking and reflecting on a few places and prior motoring experiences that spring to mind as he mostly hurtles (except around LA and a few other major congestion points) along American concrete and asphalt -- at ten miles over the posted speed limit.<br />This is not a Bill Bryson style travel book.  McMurtry rarely stops and almost never sees off road attractions or engages in explorative conversations with interesting locals.  He drives.  And reflects.  And writes about it.<br />The book does contain some interesting recollections as well as historical and place tidbits.  Many of his digressions concern authors whom he knows or admires or has opinions about.  These reflections coincide with travel through places associated these writers, so we get McMurtry's thoughts on Hemmingway while he travels through Idaho -- the state of that author's suicide.<br />What makes this work is McMurtry's well honed way with the English language.  The writing is simple and direct and engaging.  I imagine a book like this in which almost nothing happens would be a colossal bore in the hands of many other published authors.  McMurtry has the skill and sincerity to turn this meditative exploration into a worthwhile read if not a page-turner.	2002-12-16

The author weaves the history of all the events and unit movements into the fascinating story that Gettysburg can be when placed in skilled hands.  This book has enough detail for civil war students.  It also tells the larger story in a well written way that will satisfy those readers of history who are looking for the great epic in a retelling of the past.<br />Trudeau begins at the end of the Chancellorsville campaign, when Lee is pondering a move that takes advantage of the immediate situation he created in pounding Joe Hooker's Army of the Potomac.  The book delves into the decision to invade the North and Lee's preparatory moves in implementing that thrust as well as the Union following and joint mission to both shield Washington and Baltimore as well as chase down the Confederates.<br />Both of these preludes to the meeting at Gettysburg get just due.  The battle can not properly be understood without this prologue and the author handles it well.<br />The three days of July 1-3, 1863 are handled superbly.  The majesty and drama of this, the greatest armed conflict to visit North America is well told.  Unit movements at the regimental level as well as command objectives and decisions are both described.  Trudeau meshes well the front line and headquarters stories of the battle.<br />The author's extensive research leads him to some minor conclusions and thoughts that run counter to established wisdom.  These include some myth debunking and proper perspective that he buttresses with sources and first person recollections.  For example, some evidence he brings forward suggests that Chamberlain's famous right wheel of the 20th Maine might have been an accident of missed commands during the heat of battle instead of a well-planned maneuver.  Lee's greeting of his soldiers returning from Pickett's Charge is placed in the context of his accepting responsibility for an audacious (but not wrong) attack instead of the sorrowful apology that is frequently portrayed.  He is not a revisionist, but his willingness to challenge some small parts of the story with contradictory evidence is refreshing and illuminating.<br />The author uses many first person accounts of combatants and Gettysburg citizens to illuminate the history.  Although frequent, they are used in short snippets, which works well.  Some histories, in an attempt to make the first person the focus will quote long paragraphs from journals or letters -- which can often break the narrative flow of a book.  Turdeau favors the short sentence or two, or even phrase, from an observer or two to get the sense of immediacy that gives the story its drama.  This tight editing allows him to bring the participants into the story without sacrificing the pace and flow of his writing.<br />This is a very good book that deserves to take its ranks among the standards of Civil War writing.ell-planned maneuver.

It starts with tumbles from the top (what many visitors want to know about) and death on the trails.  The book also covers air crashes into the canyon, drive-offs (think Thelma & Louise), river drowning, suicides, murder and a few other odd ways people have perished in the natural attraction Teddy Roosevelt said was the one site every American should visit in their lifetime.  There are even one or two snakebite victims and two or so people who made tea from a deadly canyon flower with enough toxicity to kill a mule. Speaking of mules, the mule rides down the canyon trails are very safe when compared to other modes of enjoying the canyon.  If you don't go in winter (when snow can bury the trail), I believe the record will show that mules never go over the edge.<br />The book is most interesting in the beginning.  The topic of death and tragedy are new, and the deaths are the most shocking (including people who backed up right over the edge posing for pictures and men who went over trying to create their own waterfalls when nature called).  One does get used to the constant morbidity and toward the end the air crash vignettes, suicides and murders lack the grip of the earlier free-fall victims.  The authors also sometimes throw in annoying \\"got-cha\\" lines that seem out of place (but not too often to ruin the book).<br />Where this book is instructive is in its analysis of death in the canyon.  Stupid behavior, ignoring warnings, not taking enough water on canyon hikes and swimming in the off-limits Colorado River account for about 90% of the deaths recorded.  It is clear that the Grand Canyon could be remarkably safe if people exercised commonsense and obeyed park rules.  It is also interesting to note that males perish way out of proportion to their numbers, indicating that risky and show-off behavior is still unfortunately our birthright.<br />This book would be an excellent read for anyone contemplating a hike into the canyon or river trip through it.  I'm sure both the edges of the canyon and the river looked placid and safe for too many would be adventures that wound up as statistics in this book.  Just obeying the rules (stay behind the railings, take recommended amount of water, don't swim in the Colorado) would have saved a lot of lives.  Those visiting soon would be well warned by the mishaps listed from typical \\"vacation\\" and adventurous behavior that the Grand Canyon can be a killer if not respected.<br />Even with the 500 plus deaths recorded in the book (not counting air crashes) it is important to note that the Grand Canyon remains a safe place to enjoy one of nature's great monuments.  With the millions of visitors who have taken in its charms, statistically it is not much more dangerous to the average visitor than a walk in the park.  But for those who exercise extremely bad judgement it can be a killer.<br />This is a recommended read -- fascinating, enjoyable and with worthwhile lessons.ur birthright.<br />This book would be an excellent read for anyone contemplating a hike into the canyon or river trip through it.

The book describes the Powell Expedition's journey of exploration of the last unmapped area of the lower 48 -- the Colorado River and it's canyons (including the Grand Canyon).<br />These century and more ago adventure stories always amaze me as a modern reader.  Major Powell and his group knew nothing about the Colorado River or the canyons.  They didn't know if game would be available, they didn't know if the river contained just rapids or huge water falls like the Niagra.  They didn't know how to run river rapids -- all of the men were hardy outdoors types (some courtesy of the Civil War completed four years before their great adventure).  None of the men were boatmen and none had ever run white water.<br />Nevertheless, the intrepid Powell and his expedition started out on the Green River in present day Wyoming and followed it down through it's merger with the Colorado and through the Grand Canyon over the course of 100 days.<br />Powell was driven by the adventurer's quest to leave his mark and a love of Geology and natural history.  His crew were driven by nothing more than youthful adventurism and wages.  Although they lost one boat, had much of their food spoiled, went weeks without killing any game and regularly climbed rocky canyon sides for vantage points, no men were lost as part of the expedition.  Several later expeditions following in their wake had men drown, die from falls and exposure and generally suffered for their lack of experience, planning and knowledge.<br />Powell was an enthusiastic leader -- and lucky.  He had also left an arm in Tennessee courtesy of Confederate gunnery during the Battle of Shiloh.  Powell endured his wilderness trip with one arm and -- this is incredible -- usually was one of his party who ascended canyon sides to take readings or scout the coming river conditions.  There is an unbelievable story in the book of Powell being trapped on the side of a cliff, hanging on by one hand.  His man above had to pull him up.  With no rope, he had to take off his union suit, dangle it behind Powell and have Powell let go of the cliff in order to grab the lifeline and be pulled to safety.<br />The book has many thrilling vignettes like the one above.  Their trip was hard work.  About a third of the rapids encountered were portaged or lined instead of run.  Portage was hard work -- unloading all the supplies, carrying them around the rapid, carrying the boats (made of heavy oak) around the rapids -- over rock and w/o shoes near the end of the trip.  Lining was also hard, boats were let out through the rapid with rope and jumped around vantage points in order to get them safely through.  But many rapids were run - some without adequate knowledge of what was in store, some because many parts of the canyons through which they traveled had no side landings over which to portage or line.<br />That these backward rowing men in boats designed to runabout placid harbors were not dashed to pieces and drowned ten times during their journey is amazing.  It also makes for a heck of a good story.<br />The writing is good.  The author makes much use of Powell's classic book on the trip -- as well as his river notes, and the journals of several other participants who have survived.  The descriptions and story telling give as good of a \\"you are there\\" feel as a book can.  He also cuts away at times to modern river runners to give an appreciation of how certain famous rapids look to people who run them for a living.  This and dashes of geology and brief histories add a nice balance to the book.<br />It is amazing how these adventurers were willing to go blindly into \\"the great unknown.\\"  They stared death in the face and defeated it by a combination of luck, pluck and determination.<br />A good book for armchair adventurers.s man above had to pull him up.

They were, in short, everything this book is not.<br />&quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; is a travellogue with the emphasis on log.  What we get is a listing of the author's various motels, transportation and meals in different European cities.  This book is heavy on the actual travel and accomodations and very light on the places he's visiting.  In other books, Bryson would tell the story of the place, livening up his observations with fascinating tidbits of history and curiousities that made most of the places interesting in themselves.  In this book, the places seem just an excuse for him to ride the train or bus, change hotels, and drink beer and eat.<br />There are a few -- disappointingly few -- laugh out loud moments in the book.  On the whole, the witicisms and wry observations are replaced by overly long descriptive sentences.<br />This book was written before some of his more recent successes.

Yet it reads with the ease of a great novel.  A tribute not only to Caro's authorship, but also the material with which he worked.  Lyndon Johnson has to be just about one of the most fascinating personalities to write about.<br />This is a book about ambition and power.  Covering the ten years of the 1950's, it looks at Johnson's Senate career.  During that time, LBJ made the job of Majority Leader -- one that had been powerless and had in fact led to the defeat at the polls of two of his immediate predicessors -- into a positio of absolute authority.  LBJ did the politically impossible in taming the United States Senate.<br />Caro's focus is on Johnson's methods, personal qualities and unique appreciation for power.  As LBJ said himself, \\"I know where to find power and how to use it.\\" He did indeed.<br />For Johnson, power was a tool to gain what he set his eyes on early -- the U.S. Presidency.  LBJ didn't believe in much -- though Caro tries to make a case that some of LBJ's interest in the 1957 Civil Rights Act was alturistic.  He believed in LBJ and his right to control the Senate and ultimately the presidency.  Freed from ideology, LBJ was pure politics.  This was perhaps useful in passing our nation's first civil rights bill since Reconstruction, Eisenhower's Civil Rights Act of 1957.  LBJ was able to convince some liberals that he was really with them and almost all of the southern segregationists that he was with them.  A crucial fact that persuaded the segregationist block of senators to not use the filabuster was their desire to see a southerner in the White House.  That southerner for which they were willing to relax their 80 year stranglhold on civil rights was LBJ.<br />LBJ became their lodestar because of his relationship with Richard Russell -- southern and segregationist icon who commanded obedience from southern senators and respect from the entire body.  Russell became LBJ's champion and guide and weilded the southern block to first create and solidify LBJ's power as majority leader and then to create legislative opportunities that had previously been impossible.<br />LBJ's capture of Russell followed his life long pattern in creating power.  He always discovered who was the person who could help him the most and than worked slavishly to ingratiate himself to that person.  It worked with FDR, Sam Rayburn and Dick Russell.  His charming of these tough men -- creating almost father/son relationships (though not as close with FDR), turned these men into his agents of advancement.<br />Of course LBJ used his powers for nefarious purposes also. Caro spends a lot of time focusing on LBJ's demolishing of Leland Old's at his reconfirmation hearing -- displaying LBJ's power on behalf of natural gas producers and his willingness to utterly destroy a good man and fine public servant when it suited his purposes.<br />This is a wonderful case study on legislative power and politics.  Any legislative leader, or legislator, would learn from reading this.  The general public will be fascinated by the utterly gripping and unforgettable portrait of a man who truly was the \\"Master of the Senate.\\"sell became LBJ's champion and guide and weilded the southern block to first create and solidify LBJ's power as majority leader and then to create legislative opportunities that had previously been impossible.<br />LBJ's capture of Russell followed his life long pattern in creating power.

Since Lincoln's death, various publicity seekers, conspiracy buffs and doubters have disputed various aspects of the story.  The issues Steers deals with -- and convincingly -- are ones that have plagued the assassination story for a long time.  By assembling documentary evidence from a vast array of sources, Steers builds strong cases that: Dr. Mudd was a part of the conspiracy to capture Lincoln and was a confederate of Booth  -- and was expecting to help Booth escape from Washington; Mary Surratt was also a part of the conspiracy and thus justly convicted; the harebrained conspiracy theories involving Vice President Johnson or Sec. of War Stanton in the assassination are just that; The Confederate Secret service was active in supporting a kidnapping of Lincoln, knew Booth and provided him with resources; the top levels of the Confederate government (including Jefferson Davis) were aware of kidnap schemes (though no claim is made that Davis or others in the Confederate high command knew of or supported the assassination plot).<br />The book deftly does several things.  While telling the story of the assassination plot and Confederate secret service activities, it builds the case implicating individuals found guilty by the government but whose involvement has been questioned over the years.  Steers also tells of and demolishes notions that Booth really escaped and that an imposter was buried in his tomb -- notions that had some currency in the early Twentieth Century.  Steers provides a thorough examination of the case of Dr. Mudd -- proving his complicity in the Lincoln conspiracy and rebuking those family members who to this day try to exonerate Mudd as an innocent doctor who executed his Hippocratic Oath for the lame Booth when he came calling to his home after the murder. (Steers has also written a book solely on this topic \\"His Name Is Still Mudd\\")<br />This is an impressive work.  Steers deftly melds both the story of Lincoln's assignation plot with the detective work proving the case against those who claim mistake or cover-up.  It is well written and makes good use of primary sources.

It is largely a tale told through the adventures of governors and explorers.<br />For three centuries the Spanish had an uneasy hold on the area.  It was far away from present day Mexico, the hub of Spanish domination of the region.  Spain wanted New Mexico first to satisfy its appetite to forever expand.  Later, the region was seen as a buffer against the many tribes to the north and later still against encroaching French and English (later Americans).  Life and occupation were hard.  Numerous Indians lived in the region.  Settled farmers in pueblos that predated Spanish settlements as well as roaming plains/desert and mountain tribes who dominated the outlands.  The first were easier for the Spanish to dominate because of their fixed location.  Sometimes allies, sometimes in rebellion, the pueblo Indians had an uneasy relationship among the colonists.  They also provided the man power for agriculture, commercial enterprises and armed militia.  The plains Indians, although in some periods in commercial or military alliance with the Spanish against other tribes, were generally an over the horizon threat that had to constantly be guarded against or actively punished in order to maintain a somewhat secure area around greater Santa Fe.<br />The book focuses on forays made by the Spanish over three centuries to \\"Colorado\\" (the name used to describe the area above Santa Fe and beyond -- much larger than the present day state).  Some of these forays involved exploration, trail-blazing or trade.  Most, however, involved a military interest -- either retaliating or punishing plains tribes who made war on the colony or showing strength in the hopes that plains tribes would fear the wrath of Spain more than the entreaties of French trappers and traders who mingled with native peoples to the north.<br />This is an interesting book - principally because I had only the most general understanding of this history.  The book does have sort of an adventure/exploration quality to it as foray after foray into relatively unknown and completely natural areas of present day Colorado, Kansas, Utah and Oklahoma are examined.  The book does stick to it's mission -- the focus is on these outward thrusts of the colony.  Administration, Indian relations and everyday life are sketched over, usually as they relate to the security concerns of the area and it's ability to survive as one of the \\"furthermost outposts of Christiandom\\" as it was described by many of the Spanish.ibes who made war on the colony or showing strength in the hopes that plains tribes would fear the wrath of Spain more than the entreaties of French trappers and traders who mingled with native peoples to the north.<br />This is an interesting book - principally because I had only the most general understanding of this history.

In its hay-day, the trail linked first two cultures and then the disparate parts of the western United States.  The linkage was tenuous and strenuous.  Traders took first pack mules then wagon trains through several hundred miles of prairie -- some of it bereft of water and all of it through Indian country.<br />This book mostly tells how trade bloomed along the trail from the 1820's through the 1860's.  This economic detail is well fleshed out by the stories of the many characters that plied the trail or supported its existence.  Interesting incidents and first person accounts are liberally strewn throughout the work and give this book its appeal -- otherwise it would be a subject as dry as the short fork to Santa Fe.<br />I was left with a sense of wonder at the risks these traders and travelers took -- particularly the early ones.  Around 1810 -1820, most Americans who reached Santa Fe were rounded up and jailed -- some for five to eight years.  Even in the era when the vast majority of early trail blazers failed to return to Missouri, there were always new would- be entrepreneurs ready to set out the next season.  Such was the spirit of pioneering Americans and the lure of riches.  Even after Spain/Mexico decided to welcome Americans in trade, there remained fairly high chances of succumbing to Indians, weather, or lack of water.  The incredible perseverance and relentless pursuit of this open trade route is remarkable -- particularly to a reader of our era.<br />Although the subject is somewhat dry -- this is a story about economics and transportation -- the author does an admirable job of using interesting characters and stories from the trail to enliven the work.ail to enliven the work.	2002-08-16

It is broader.  The book is a history of the polity known as the CSA.<br />The first few chapters give a strong recap of the different philosophical strains that led the delegates to Montgomery to craft the CSA's constitution.  These chapters are well done. The reader has a good idea of the tensions that framed early issues of governance.<br />In other chapters, Davis writes about federal-state relations, the administration of justice in the Confederacy, the socialization of key industries (in an abortive republic founded on the sanctity of property rights!) and other interesting aspects of the slave nation.<br />Davis provides many interesting descriptions and some new information -- even for serious Civil War buffs.  However, this is somewhat of an uneven book.  In several chapters, Davis uses a few or even one anecdote to draw conclusions at a broad level -- the reader is unsure if these descriptions are generally true or extrapolations.<br />He spends a lot of time with the governors and on dissidents.  This is not a drawback, but the book is weighted toward the mindset of the Confederacy as opposed to a description of how it worked and how the machinery of government functioned (or didn't).  There are good sections on the frustrations and lives of regular folk.  Military aspects are treated with seperate and short sections giving brief descriptions of broad aspects of the war.  This is a positive, as it would have been easy to pad a book on the CSA with military recaps that are properly the subject of military histories.<br />Not bad, overall.	2002-07-24

That is at least how Lord Halifax saw the options. Churchill was resolute from the beginning -- any hint try at accommodation would lead to the eventual destruction of Britain and cement the Nazi map of Europe in place.<br />The five days in question follow a long debate among the cabinet, or chiefly among Churchill and Halifax, regarding the issue of whether or not to advance an overture to Hitler.  Chamberlain played some role, usually siding with Churchill as the discussions progresssed, but holding the balance of power none the less.<br />Why is this debate important?  Well, with the clarity offered by hindsight, it is now easy to appreciate that any attempt at purchasing peace from Hitler would have only meant a thus weakened Britain would have been added to the Third Reich later.  In the spring of 1940, serious people seriously discussed this acquiescence strategy in London.  If that strategy had been followed, it is possible that the English government of the time could have lost the war for civilization.  Thus, the author's important point is correct.  During this period -- this hinge of history -- Churchill did not lose the war -- and thus deserves history's gratitude.<br />Why did Churchill simply not force the issue?  For several reasons.  He was in the PM's chair only a fortnight -- the second choice of the King and the Conservative Party (Halifax, the first choice, had turned it down requiring one to appreciate either his selfless patriotism, divine intervention, or some combination of both).  It was probable that a major disagreement within the War Cabinet would have brought him down and proved disasterous for public morale.  In addition, any public hint that the War Cabinet was even thinking about an accommodation of Hitler would have quite likely retarded the English people's will to resist.  (I can state from personal experience in assuming a political leadership role at the head of a divided caucus that in the beginning one must build political capital until a point is reached where decisive action can be taken by the leader because it will be supported, even it the decision proves costly or presents great difficulty.)<br />Churchill had the wisdom to know that his only choice in making the right choice (ie, rejecting accommodation and fighting to the end), required his moving the War Cabinet decisively behind his position through personal diplomacy and moral suasion.  Churchill proved to be a master of this technique (interesting to view because he is remembered publicly for his defiant and blustery leadership, but he was quite the canny politico, too).<br />This book tells the tale in an interesting way.  Each day is a chapter.  The War Cabinet meeting summaries are nicely interspersed with background discussions of the participants, an overview of the political and military situations and a daily reading of public opinion (as gleaned from an early survey technique employed by the government and some newspaper and diary accounts).  I would have preferred more discussion of the cabinet sessions and thought the daily public opinion discussion could have been discarded.  However, this is a neat little book that should be of interest to any WWII devotee or political science student.  The author does a good job and makes his case well regarding the decisiveness of this time period for human history.udent.

This two day fire fight cost a dozen and a half American soldiers their lives -- and sent our country packing from the god-forsaken mess of a non-functioning entity that was early 1990's Somalia.<br />This is a ground level, violent, confused battle book.  The book hardly mentions the larger mission and dwells not on why we were there.  It is a group biography of young Americans who made up the Ranger, Delta Force and helicopter fighters stationed on the east coast of Africa in support of a United Nations feeding and pacification exercise.<br />What started off as a mission to grab the chief lieutenants of a local strongman disintegrated into a bloody mess after thousands of Somali's rose in opposition and defiance.  The American team was pinned to their urban location after two Black Hawk helicopters went down from enemy fire.  What was supposed to be an hour hit and run strike drag out over two days by the need to get to and secure the crash sites and the surviving crew and passengers.<br />The book is fast paced and cuts quickly between several dozen characters.  It can be confusing and hard to follow at times, but this has the effect of illustrating well how confused and disoriented our soldiers were (and probably how most battles are).  The tremendous amount of time and effort that went into the hundreds of interviews conducted by the author produce a vivid first person account of battle.  It illustrates well the point made by one veteran in the book that &quot;young soldiers can't wait to get into their first war.  Veteran soldiers can't wait to get away from war.&quot;<br />First rate, exciting and a tremendous tribute to our fighting men, if not to the political decisions that put them there.	2002-07-09

That was one of the few positives that saw an expedition of a dozen and a half men whittled down to six shoe eating survivors who were finally rescued two years and many tragedies later.<br />Greely's was an American military expedition -- though set off without the full or enthusiastic support of General Sherman or Sec. of War Lincoln (the President's son).  In fact, Sec. of War Lincoln is one of the chief villains in the story -- the archetype cold bureaucrat who worries about everything but the lives of the men and their succor during their years of peril and while totally dependant on annual relief ships that never make their landing as agreed.<br />Although Greeley's first year went rather smoothly and the failure to find a relief ship worrisome thought not disastrous, the second absence forced the men to march through the frozen artic to an agreed upon rescue point some two hundred miles from their camp (Ft. Conger).  Pre-positioned supplies were not there in quantities promised nor was an anticipated ship to take them home.  The men had to winter in tents with few provisions, little game, and lessening hope.  Most would die, cannibalism would become an element of survival and bureaucratic ineptitude would continue to prevent an organized and serious effort to help these men go forward.<br />The author has written a well researched and interesting book.  He gives good concise backgrounds on Greely and the other principal players in the drama.  Throughout the book she intersperses scenes from above the Arctic Circle with farcical scenes from Washington as the Army Department, Navy Department and the Army Department's Signal Bureau send memos, blame, investigations and poorly organized, manned and planned relief ships.  Although sometimes the bureaucratic parts of the book drag, the glimpse it provides of an inept officialdom has to be told to be believed.  And Greely's men suffered for it.<br />This is a good and exciting tale of arctic exploration and survival.  The author uses the many diary entries the existed from men who were part of the expedition to recreate a believable first-person account of this strange and sad saga from our past.the book drag, the glimpse it provides of an inept officialdom has to be told to be believed.

Many of the crew were not trained and had never been in harsh winter conditions.  Supplies were bought and stowed haphazardly.  The very ship worried the captain as being unworthy and not suited to travel in the ice.  The leader bought second hand winter gear at rummage sale prices to save money and cheap pemmican that was not tested for purity.<br />After the ship stuck fast in the ice north of Alaska, the leader, a shameless man named Steffansson, abandoned the crew to head over the ice toward land.  He did not go for help, but left so that he could continue to pursue his own egotistical goal of finding new lands above the Arctic Circle.  That left the men (and one woman and two children who were part of an Eskimo family) at the fate of Captain Bartlett.<br />Fortunately, the Captain was a man of courage and character.  His one great flaw happened early on, but was fatal.  He knows his ship was not up to the journey north.  Why an experienced captain like himself agreed to proceed is a mystery, but it was fortunate for the eventual survivors that he did. (Had he chosen not to captain the ship, Steffanson would have found another captain, probably made of lesser stuff than Bartlett.)<br />Bartlett would provide the authority, example and leadership that allowed half the crew to survive a winter on the ice and many months camped out on the most god-forsaken island in the world, Wrangle Island.<br />This fine book includes descriptions of life aboard the Karluk, life aboard an ice floe after the ship was crushed, a trek across miles of arctic ice to a godforsaken island that offered little in the way of improvement save its fixed location, a final two hundred mile hike by the Captain and his Eskimo from the island, across more frozen ocean, and across northern Siberia in order to mount a relief effort.<br />This tale is gripping.  What these people endured, particularly the party that waited months on Wrangle Island not even knowing if Captain Bartlett had even reached Siberia is fascinating.  This is a tale of grit, determination, strong characters and weak.  It is a fine tale of arctic survival, well worth the read.What these people endured, particularly the party that waited months on Wrangle Island not even knowing if Captain Bartlett had even reached Siberia is fascinating.

Of course the very fact that O'Rourke finds humor in the temple of \\"world crises\\" will convince those people that conservatives can be worse than cold scolds -- they even laugh in the face of serious problems.<br />All The Trouble in the World focuses P.J. O'Rourke's biting satire and sarcasm on several topics that were hot in the early 1990's (and still are): overpopulation, famine, ecological apocalypse, multiculturalism, and miserable third world regimes that hide their brutality and failure behind the facade of socialism and first world envy.<br />Interspersed behind the barbs and wise-guy cracks are usually thoughtful analysis and intelligent criticism.  For example, he compares Bangladesh with Fresno, California.  Both have the same density, but find themselves in dramatically different conditions.  While Bangladesh has some problems not found in Fresno, O'Rourke argues it's lack of free markets and a creaking bureaucracy overwhelm what had historically been a pretty productive population.  Of course, his travels there set the stage for many humorous observations and situations (The Ministry of Jute -- Monty Python would have had a time with that one).<br />Some of the best chapters focus on our own living room liberals: those whose mission it is to save America from itself.  Two chapters on multiculturalism and the world environmental movement show the length to which people who think of themselves as liberal have really become authoritarians who brook no dissent (nor inconvenient facts) in their quest to make the world right by their mind.  The jokes just write themselves in these chapters -- there is such a gulf between some of these people and the real world (not to mention freedom and the Constitution) -- that one alternates between laughter and amazement when reading of what is being done \\"for\\" us by those who don't trust us.<br />Sometimes the humor wears -- I get the same feeling when reading Dave Berry.  A little time between chapters keeps the material more fresh and sharp.  But O'Rourke undergirds all of his criticisms (this is a critical analysis) with facts and thoughtful arguments.  He doesn't necessarily have all the answers, but he does have a different and refreshing perspective.and amazement when reading of what is being done \\"for\\" us by those who don't trust us.<br />Sometimes the humor wears -- I get the same feeling when reading Dave Berry.

Ellis has the talent of emphasizing the \\"story\\" part of history - a feat lacking in many works of the genre.  The writing alone makes this a pleasurable read.<br />The author's thesis - that the founders were brothers - in philosophy, thought, revolution and devotion to our new nation - is a correct semantic observation to a limited extent.  What is presented in this book are the sibling rivalries as these brothers of  '76 clashed over what the nation, constitution and the revolution itself meant twenty to thirty years later.<br />Ellis does this through several dramatic vignettes.  He first presents the Hamilton-Burr duel - sibling rivalry taken to a fratricidal extreme.  There is some interesting interpretation as to whether or not Hamilton fired \\"up\\" or \\"over\\" Burr and whether or not he fired first.  But what was represented in a larger sense was a duel between avarice, opportunism and pure selfish gamesmanship (Burr), and political warfare with a larger purpose (Hamilton).<br />Other stories are fascinating.  The tale of one of the great horse trades in U. S. History that ended up settling the seat of government on the Potomac River is detailed in \\"The Dinner.\\"  Ellis also covers the election of 1800, Washington's Farewell Address and the fascinating correspondence between Jefferson and Adams that ended, remarkably, on July 4th, 1826, when both died on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.<br />I liked this book.  The prose moves and as mentioned, Ellis is very good at writing interesting history.  On occasion, he made a few over-the-top statements (like saying Hamilton's keeping in close contact with Adams' cabinet members verged on the treasonable), but he avoids hyperbole or the wacky revisionism that seems to be in fashion to \\"sell\\" history these days.  I must admit that the more I read of Jefferson and Adams as politicians statesmen, the better Adams comes off in comparison.<br />These snapshots of our first governments don't tell the full story of the Federalist and Jeffersonian periods.  They do, however, give a pleasing taste of the personalities and dealings as revolutionaries struggled to run the government they had made.pshots of our first governments don't tell the full story of the Federalist and Jeffersonian periods.

Breckenridge is the hero of William Davis' new book &quot;An Honorable Defeat.&quot;  The former US Vice President, Confederate general and Jefferson Davis' last Secretary of War earns the title in the author's description of the battle between Breckenridge and CSA President Davis.  Their confrontation was over continuing the struggle as Davis wanted or accepting the obvious and affording the southern people peace, an easier reconstruction and ultimately honor, as Breckenridge strove for and ultimately helped bring about.<br />Parts of this book are interesting.  The author details the last gasps of the Confederate cabinet in Richmond as it struggles with the encirclement of Grant and his Union host.  Robert E. Lee and Breckenridge concoct an effort to present Jefferson Davis with a fait accompli and hopefully end the war.  Although the strategy was agreed to, Lee pulled up at the last moment, reverting in his argument to dutiful soldier serving his president instead of agent of history who had a chance to serve the South by recognizing the inevitable.  This interesting vignette had been unknown to me as a Civil War enthusiast and is the type of fascinating tidbit that the civil war reader will appreciate. (Although it must be noted, this occured before Appomattox and was designed to end the war everywhere. With his own field army, Lee did perform a great service to the nation by surrendering instead of attempting to break out or encourage partisan warfare).<br />The book also traces the flight of the Confederate government out of Richmond and it's travails as it sheds respect, adherents, transport and finally hope along the trail.  In the midst of this journey, Breckenridge almost pulls off a very soft landing for the Confederacy when he and Joseph Johnston negotiate the short-lived broad peace with General Sherman.  Unwanted by Davis and rejected by the North, this foray illustrates the lengths to which Breckenridge was working against Davis at this point.  An effective and purposeful man, Breckenridge had for all intents and purposes become the leader of what little remained of the Confederacy and continually maneuvered to force Davis to end his dream of escaping across the Mississippi to continue the struggle.  At crucial times, the Secretary of War also thwarted Davis' policies and desires in order to avoid more senseless bloodshed and the Confederacy's slip into &quot;farce&quot; as he termed it.<br />This battle of wills is interesting.  So are the last gasps of the rebel government and the winding down of hostilities.<br />Less interesting is the journey that the Davis party took in aimlessly wandering around the Carolinas and Georgia.  The final escape of Breckenridge and Secretary of State Judah Benjamin through Florida is also recounted in some detail.<br />All in all this book has some interesting and little explored history.  Those parts are well written.  The travelogue is less aptly dealt with and the author does have some excess pages detailing the various rides and camp settings that could have been trimmed down and told with more verve.  The final journey of Breckenridge, which was fraught with danger, also somehow didn't come off as exciting as it I thought it could have been.<br />However, on the whole this book will please the Civil War devotee looking to explore yet another facet of the great struggle that never loses its hold on our imaginations.  The general reader might find this a little too focused.An effective and purposeful man, Breckenridge had for all intents and purposes become the leader of what little remained of the Confederacy and continually maneuvered to force Davis to end his dream of escaping across the Mississippi to continue the struggle.

I am amazed that so many and varied first person accounts of those battles exist.  Usually, Lexington and Concord are presented as quick preludes to the War of Revolution  -- the actors anonymous except for Gen. Thomas Gage.  Tourtellot introduces local clergy, militia captains, minutemen, patriots and citizens who all combined to start the colonies on the road to independence.<br />Lurking in the background is Samuel Adams.  His preparation of the political ground that would set the stage for the confrontation with the British is neatly summarized in this book.  Other notables, such as patriot rider Paul Revere, are also given their due in this story.<br />This fine book gives a background on the village and attitudes of Lexington, MA leading up to the battle.  The last chapters also tell how Adams, Dr. Joseph Warren and others made quick and effective use of the conflict to great effect on the minds of fellow Americans and the quite sizable segment of British public opinion who harbored at least some sympathy for the American point of view.<br />The heart of the book is the military confrontation.  The author writes crisply and clearly, even while including fascinating narrative and first person accounts.  General Gage's plan is in reaction to pressure from the Crown and Parliament to take some action to assert Royal authority over increasingly rebellious colonials.  His march to Concord (through Lexington) is designed to seize American powder and arms.<br />Massachusetts patriots are at the ready.  With an effective spy and warning system, they know of the planned action before most of Gage's junior officers.  After the famous two lanterns are hung in the Old North Church, the book traces the march, marshalling of patriot forces and the encounters at Lexington and Concord that marked British initiative during the battle.  The rising of a violent country-side that almost engulfed Col. Smith's British force is told in fascinating detail.  But for the arrival of Lord Percy's relief force on a bluff near Lexington, Smith's retreating redcoats probably would have been overwhelmed. Percy was able to save most of the British force and lead them through a withering march to Boston -- a march where the British literally ran a gauntlet of woods and walls concealing American militiamen who were to take a significant toll on the King's forces.<br />This is an exciting tail that is well told.  The book contains excellent maps that help the reader visualize the action and route of march.  The author has succeeded in breathing exciting life into a little confrontation that wrote large upon the pages of history.rch, marshalling of patriot forces and the encounters at Lexington and Concord that marked British initiative during the battle.

McMurty Finishes Series On A High Note	Comanche Moon, the prequel to Pulitzer Prize winning Lonesome Dove, finishes McMurty's Western series on an excellent note.  In this, he recovers from \\"Dead Man's Walk,\\" which I rated a good book, but not on a par with the others in his four book classic of the American West.<br />Here are Woodrow Call and Agustus McCrae, two Texas Rangers, becoming the personalities they will inhabit in Lonesome Dove (the first book of the series, though the third in time).  These two start out as veteran Rangers, having earned their spurs during the hard years portrayed in \\"Dead Man's Walk.\\"<br />Adventure and luck make them co-captains of the Rangers.  This book starts with their expedition under the ever fascinating Captain Inish Scull.  When Scull's wanderlust gets the best of him, he departs his ranger force in the middle of Indian Country, giving field promotions to Call and Gus.<br />This book focus on wonderful characters:  Bufalo Hump, Kicking Wolf and Famous Shoes - two Comanche and a Kickapoo indian; Captain Scull and his ever amorous wife Inez; the women in our protagonists lives - Maggie the kindly prostitute and Carla the only human being able to corral McCrae's practiced insolence; Ahumado, the tortuous Mayan who has raised human suffering to a wicked art form.  Also, several of the characters who provide wonderful support in Lonesome Dove arrive:  Pea Eye, Deets, Jake Spoon and Blue Duck.<br />This book ranges over multiple plot lines as the author shifts focus form person to person.  McMurty develops the indian characters to a high degree in this book -- they are interesting and sympathetic beings with histories, fears, weaknesses and beliefs -- just like the cowboys and sherrifs who populate the rest of the book.<br />\\"Comanche Moon\\" is an epic tale that never tires or bores.  It is wide ranging and covers about twenty years in three major divisionis (or \\"books\\" as the author refers to them).  Something interesting happens frequently, but there are chapters that develop characters or just take the story a little further with nary an arrow, shot, death or narrow escape (differnt from \\"Dead Man's Walk,\\" which almost had a serial quality in the relentless action or cliff hanger appearing dutifully at the end of each chapter).<br />This book excites but also paints a great character sketch of McMutry's West as it exists in his Texas.

It is interesting because both characters are clearly the men they will become in Lonesome Dove, yet without the assurance and confidence that carried them so easily through that book's trials.  The author does a good job of portraying them as believable youths rather than as copies of their later selves in younger bodies.<br />This is a roaming tale.  There are three trips which encompass the book.  The first is a brief and futile foray against the fearsome Comanche Buffalo Hump.  The second, a long and futile expedition to capture Spanish Gold in New Mexico that is thwarted by the elements and a Mexican army.  The third, a march in captivity through a desolate country that will prove to be a more ruthless enemy than the Indian or the sons of the conquistadors.<br />I will warn the reader, the ending is a little bizarre and seems out of place with the rest of the book (and the preceding two) -- it really lost the Western feel for me.<br />This journey is much less purposeful and more fantastic than that portrayed in LD or Streets of Laredo.  This tale feels at times a bit forced, with something exciting fitted neatly into every chapter.  On the whole however, it is a good yarn that captures a flavorful frontier West before the Civil War.  McMurty remains a gifted storey teller who is able to drive the reader through his pages with gifted dialogue and excellent descriptions.<br />I'm already digging into McMurty's last book of the Lonesome Dove series, Comanche Moon.	2002-03-29

It's also a book with a split personality, but one that works in the end.<br />&quot;Made in America: An Informal History of the English Language in the United States,&quot; is more than the title suggests.  Much of the book is given over to an exploration of American English etymology and phraseology.  However, Bryson spends considerable time venturing off into what can best be described as an anecdotal journey through American history.<br />It works.  In fact, the anecdotalisms are the best part of the book.  I've noticed in this and &quot;The Mother Tongue&quot; (his exploration of the King's English), Bryson's word histories sometimes run towards long lists with not enough exploration to make them interesting.  That same pattern is true for the early part of this book.  However, Bryson soon gets sidetracked in discussing various historical oddities and characters that make very interesting and usually witty reading.<br />This is a good, light book that can be enjoyed in small pieces if desired.  It's anecdotal parts most resemble one of those &quot;1001 Things Everyone Ought To Know About American History Books&quot; -- in short, a collection of brief and interesting stories that are well written and evoke the occasional guffaw.<br />His word derivations and explorations are more scholarly and exact. Often fascinating, they sometimes are a bit too list oriented and crowded.  But, ultimately they are still interesting if one would like to know why we:  &quot;Keep the ball rolling,&quot; live in many places named after Indian words, call our soldiers &quot;GIs drive in &quot;cars&quot; and &quot;autos&quot; or speak in the numerous ways that are not literal nor necessarily logical but are definitely American.	2002-03-15

He found two soldiers, Franklin Horner (USA) and Thomas Ware (CSA), who faced each other across a few dangerous yards at Gettysburg.  He retraced their routes of march to the battle through their diary entries (over 35 days - hence the title).<br />Both enlisted men got to the battlefield the old fashioned way:  walking.  Unfortunately, their writing is not similarly matched.  Whereas the Ware diary entries are often vivid and descriptive, the author's Union traveler records at best three or four lines of not very illuminating fragments on the same days. The result is leads to a somewhat unbalanced first person description of the route to Gettysburg.  I can imagine finding two surviving diaries from adversaries who faced each other in opposing regiments was difficult, and the author is to be recognized for a very good idea.  One wishes his task could have been better fulfilled with two prodigious diarists.<br />Each of the 35 chapters starts off with the opposing diary entries.  The author then explains the section of march (if they were marching that day) each soldier traveled.  The author also spends significant time describing camp life, service in general and the trials of marching experienced by civil war soldiers in general.  I was somewhat surprised that the author spent the bulk of the book on general descriptions and backgrounds instead of the march to Gettysburg (as one could have supposed from the title).  However, it must be acknowledged that this background is a good introduction to soldierly travails in that war.<br />The section on their units meeting at the foot of Little Round Top is the best part of the book.  Nesbitt fleshes out these chapters with unit commanders' action reports -- the result is a more vivid and full description of the last of the 35 days.<br />All in all an interesting book, but I wished it could have been more fully focused on the actual march and had a better Union diarist as a story teller.diarist as a story teller.	2002-02-27

This book, \\"Theodore Rex,\\" lives up to the standard set by Morris in the wonderful \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,\\" which won a Pulitzer Prize.<br />The author's prodigious research talents are again on display, as is his masterful ability to weave facts and minutia into a gripping historical tale.<br />The reader gets the full throttled and powerful President Roosevelt during his almost two terms in office.  The book picks up nicely where I remembered his first volume leaving off.  Roosevelt is summoned from the Maine wilderness upon the news of President McKinley's death. His descent down the mountain and into history is watched by those unsure what the youngest president (still) will mean for a newly industrialized and internationalized America.<br />The next seven years portray a man utterly sure of himself and his actions.  Roosevelt defined the modern presidency for our time -- being the first executive to wield power aggressively and successfully without the benefit of a war.  Indeed, the period between Lincoln and TR was one of congressional ascendancy.  Roosevelt through force of personality, public appeal, Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress, and facets of American economic life ripe for reform made the office paramount among the branches of government.<br />He enjoyed a tremendously successful reign (to continue with the spirit of the title).  Most of his major legislative initiatives were to be written into law.  As importantly, he coined the practice and phrase of using his office as a \\"bully pulpit\\" to reach over the heads of legislators to the people of the country - thereby harnessing and focusing the power of citizens to guide Congress to action.  He also took the role of the government in a startling new direction for a Republic borne of reaction to sovereign interference in private liberties.  Through Roosevelt, the federal government became the regulator,  monitor and some-time arbiter of large economic interests, destroying forever the almost complete system of laisie-faire that had served a growing country so well up to that point (though by the time of Roosevelt's era courting potentially dangerous reaction through it's excesses and monopolistic practices*).  He also cast government in the role of defender of natural resources, giving rise to conservation as an animating factor of public policy.<br />Roosevelt also brought a semi-enlightened attitude to civil rights to the White House.  Though never completely divorcing race relations from his own political fortunes and needs, he never the less was willing to deal with American negros as civic beings entitled to basic respect and constitutional rights.  At critical times (though not at every critical time), he also decried the terrorism and inequities some Americans visited upon our fellow citizens.  From today's vantage point any reader finds himself wishing that TR would have championed an end to lynching and more complete civil rights as well as enlightened personal views on the capacity of the negro to be quicly assimilated given equal legal protection and a better social clime.  For his time, he made significant progress (albeit mostly with gestures and statements) and became a champion to many black Americans who felt they had a sympathetic president for the first time since Lincoln (although some of the good will was washed away with TR's mis-handling of the Brownsville incident).<br />Morris also probes TR's adroit diplomatic skills and successful projection of American power among the world's nations.  Most fascinating is the tale of our \\"almost war\\" with Germany over Venezuela -- a saga so intertwined with diplomacy and face saving as it's solution that three governments conspired to remove official records of the transaction from their archives -- making it still difficult today to understand exactly what happened.  As energetic and successful as he was in domestic policy, TR drove America to the forefront of nations through his acquisition of Panama, settlement of the Venezuelan affair, brokering of the peace between Japan and Russia, and significantly through the expansion of our navy announced most spectacularly with the round the world cruise of the Great White Fleet.  He was a brilliant practitioner of politics and diplomacy in wrestling for America a greater degree of influence and power in international affairs than we had enjoyed up to that point.<br />This is TR -- larger than life, sitting astride the Congress, the nation and finally the world.  This is not a hagiography, TR's mistakes, short comings and deficiencies are covered.  But, particularly through the lens of a century past, it is easy to see overall greatness in the character, initiatives, politics and even being of the man.  Morris does historic and literary justice to Roosevelt, telling the incredible and fascinating story of our country's most energetic president with an energy that inspires as it illuminates.<br />Highly recommended. (Mr. Morris, please don't make us wait another twenty years for the final volume!!!).<br />*It is interesting to note that both TR and his second cousin FDR saw themselves as the defenders and saviours of a capitalist system at risk of wholesale socialization by extremists.  Both viewed themselves as inherently conservative because of their conviction that an American economic system that would not address its own widely perceived excesses through regulation courted nationalization by the Bryons and Longs of the world.

I have not read any of his horror books (The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is my only previous foray besides \\"On Writing\\"), but these stories feature horrible happenings instead of pure horror.<br />The first, \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,\\" is superb.  A story of hope and will, it features excellent characterization and a description of the brutality and banality of prison life that will fascinate.  The two lead characters are each survivors in their own right, and form a bond stronger than friendship that aids each in surviving -- and thriving.<br />The next story, \\"Apt Pupil,\\" is a fascinating tale of a teen who discovers an old Nazi, and unlocks a future he could never imagine. This book has some of the most grisly scenes of any of the four -- with descriptions of WWII atrocities and real horrors.  The young teen undergoes a remarkable transformation when he embraces knowledge and curiosities that end up being more than he ever could have bargained for.<br />The third, \\"The Body,\\" is a journey (literal and figurative) by a group of twelve year old best friends to view the body of a kid their age -- a kid who has been missing while picking blueberries and was struck by a train in the back woods of Maine.<br />The fourth, the shortest of the bunch, is a suspense story spun at Christmastime by a (member is the wrong word) associate of a most unusual men's club.<br />The writing is very good.

The man known as the &quot;G.I. General&quot; comes across as an island of equanimity in a sea of incredible egos like Patton, Montgomery et al.<br />This book is Bradley's take on events.  I am sure that some involved in controversies he covered (Patton's slapping incident, Montgomery at Caen, Falaise and Arnhem) would defend their actions (or inactions) vigorously.  Yet this account has an aura of authenticity due to the author's lack of need to tout his own accomplishments (which were many).  This inner peacefulness, along with command ability, probably explains Bradley's rise to the level of senior American ground commander in Europe.<br />For an insider's account of the American effort and strategic management in the European Theater of Operations, this book is superb.  It is well written, clear and largely devoid of the bombast that can weigh down some combat and command accounts.  Although a big book, it reads quickly.	2002-02-01

It presents a traditional military campaign history of the Revolution. What the reader gets are clear descriptions of battles and the ebb and flow of the war between the British and our side.<br />It's easy to read and well-organized format make this an ideal reference work, also. Although maps are simply drawn, they convey a clear picture of troop dispositions and identities at major battles.<br />There is a romance to this book that perhaps harks back to an earlier time. Although our side is portrayed faults as well as triumphs, Ward has a simple eloquence that imparts to reader a sense of wonder and patriotism at the perseverance of our troops and leaders. Richard Ketchum comes to mind as a comparison in his more recent accounts of Revolutionary War battles (although Ketchum makes more use of diary entries as he is focusing on single battles as opposed to the entire War).<br />This is out of print and will only be found on Z-shops or at antique bookstores. Ward's contemporary book, \\"The Delaware Continentals,\\" was recently reprinted by the Delaware Heritage Commission. That book covers much of the same ground, although with a focus on the activities of the Delaware troops throughout the war. One hopes that a publisher will someday reprint Ward's \\"The War of the Revolution\\" so that current readers may enjoy this gem of a history.	2002-02-01

I also do not pretend to be a Bible scholar.  However, I have begun to read the gospels and appreciate the NIV Study Bible as illuminating and interesting.<br />This version of The Book will appeal to those who, like myself, have a great interest in history or who appreciate contextual explanations and clarifications.  There are maps, timelines and an incredible amount of footnotes.  There are also discussions of authors of the various books which serve to explain, as best as anyone can 1800 years or so after the fact, the objectives of those who first recorded and transmitted the word and teachings of God.<br />Writings this old contain many anarchism's and unfamiliarity's, both of place and practice.  While it is not necessary to unravel those mysteries of another time in order to understand the meaning of the Bible, standard versions can lead one with a lot of musings about the location of towns, the value of coinage, the everyday practices for which the authors' original audiences needed no explanation and the broader lives of historical figures mentioned in scripture.  If you are prone to want to know more about these types of things, than this version of the Bible will be deeply satisfying.  (The footnotes also point out cross-references to different books of the Bible in order to underscore prophecy and help tie in the various writings to the whole).<br />I find this a very enjoyable, fascinating and educational Bible that enhances the Message with historical and contextual depth that in no way diminishes the focus on the Word of God.	2002-02-01

The best accolade for this book:  I read it aloud to my first grader and kindergartener over about a month.  Most nights they were clamoring for another \\"Harry Potter\\" session.<br />And what's not to like for young kids?  This book features an English boy Harry Potter, living an utterly miserable life with an aunt and uncle who wish he had never been forced upon them.  Potter's cousin is big, fat and make's Harry's life unbearable.  Auntie and Uncle force him to live under the stairs, though a spare bedroom holds their son's toys.<br />Harry's life changes when he is informed he is a wizard - an not just any wizard, but the son who defied the evil Voldemort, the darkest practitioner of the Black Arts, by living when \\"You Know Who\\" (as he is referred to by magic types to terrified to say Voldemort) came to kill Harry's entire family when he was a toddler.<br />Harry is soon off to magic school at the wonderful Hogwarts. Without spoiling the book,  understand that many magical and interesting things happen at Hogwarts:  broom flying, the impossible to understand game of Quiddich, baby dragons, potions and spells, journeys into forbidding forests and plain old fashioned school chumming.<br />It's a little tough for me to judge this book as an adult read, since I read the entire thing aloud.  My kids were enchanted.  That's enough for five stars in my book.<br />A note:  This is a fun book.  Yes, it's about witchcraft and magic and good and evil.  Those who liken this to some type of threat to God and morality by its' embrace of the Halloween Arts should lighten up.  It's just a ripping good yarn aimed at young kids - not the type of thing that will set youngsters off dressed in black clutching an Ouiji Board.  My youngsters had no problem realizing the fantastic story was just that.	2002-01-30

When his side was out of favor, he sought out the still loyal crown colony of Virginia for a safe haven.<br />After a storm tossed voyage across the Atlantic, several of his party were stranded near present-day Fenwick Island, Delaware.  Alone in winter, his starving band was saved by friendly Indians who treated his party with kindness even though both sides could not communicate with each other.<br />Norwood and several of his group journeyed on foot with the aid of a local Indian guide and English settler who was brought to them by an Indian messenger.  He finally made his way to Jamestown and safety.<br />Norwood - by then only 35 - would go on to many more life adventures, including finally serving Charles II upon his restoration to the crown.<br />This book fascinates.  Slim, it is rich in detail.  The reader will receive excellent accounts of what it was like to be a voyager on those early trans-Atlantic crossings and experience the white-knuckle fright of being taken apart by a vicious storm while still out to sea.  Norwoods's true adventure of survival after being abandoned by his party on the Eastern Shore islands is gripping.  Most interesting also is the account of Indian life and habits while his party recuperated with the friendly band of King Kickotank and his band -- surely among the most accommodating and welcoming Indians found in the history of our settlement.<br />Apparently the legend of Henry Norwood is known today in the Eastern Shore area of Maryland.  I had not known of him prior to getting this book, but I am glad to read his true story in a gem of a history by author Sharon Himes.  I'm sure this book will interest folks on the Delmarva Peninsula, but it should not be overlooked by any wanting a fascinating story of survival and the life and travails of early settlers and adventurers.	2002-01-29

Unfortunately, it is also uneven and uninspired in places.<br />The author paints impressions of the Great Plains, that wide open part of America that makes up the midlands west of the Mississippi.<br />There is no central theme or organized approach to this writing.  It meanders with the pace of Plain's rivers and sometimes cuts back and forth like headwaters in their mountain birth places.<br />Ian Frazier, the author, is good at describing Crazy Horse, for whom he feels strong admiration, mountain men, an ICBM system in Montana, black and white harmony in what may be the sole surviving Freedman's town in the Plains and other historical tidbits.  At times his specific writings are engaging and filled with interesting anecdotes (so are his end notes, which are worth perusing).  His various portrayals of aspects of Indian life are perhaps the most engaging parts of the book.<br />However, at other times Frazier lays out pages where nothing much interesting happens in encounters he has with various folks of the Mid West.  It almost seems as if journal entries had been inserted at various points to fill out the book -- entries that had not made it into the first draft.  At one point he lists for several pages one and two sentence descriptions of inhabitants from one county around the turn of the Twentieth Century -- the type that one would find in a local census.  The list isn't very illustrative and I wondered why he had thought it worthy after the first few entries proved they were plain folk about whom not much is known.<br />Overall, I'd rate this 3 1/2 stars if Amazon had such a rating.  The writing can be good and Frazier is witty in places (although overwrought in others).  Some of the place descriptions and historic images are well done and hold the reader's attention.  The scenes are disjointed and some uninteresting travel impressions of the author are interspersed throughout.  I was left feeling that a book about as big an area as the Great Plains could have been less, well plain.n area as the Great Plains could have been less, well plain.	2002-01-26

This book is an eclectic survey of the English language:  its origins, evolution, borrowings from other languages, pronunciation and more.  Through the book, Bryson's trademark humor is present.  Although this book has less laughs per page than &quot;A Walk in the Woods,&quot; it features Bryson's wonderful wit and leaves out the sarcasm that made some of his earlier efforts less than par.<br />Bryson clearly loves and respects the power of English.  Perhaps alone among major languages, English developed without official sanction in the fields and streets of early medieval England, where the court spoke Norman French.  Looked down upon, it was free to flourish and find expression for how most people really lived their lives.<br />This lack of officialdom during its birth and early rearing left us with wacky spelling and a few other eccentricities.  But it also greatly simplified the language by, for example, eliminating the masculine and feminine articles inherent in French and the large number of verb forms associated with other descendents of Latin.<br />It also picked up more words and thus maintains a larger vocabulary than its European rivals, according to the author.  This has given English the ability to richly texture speech and writings and provide a sublime ability to distinguish expression and thought more so than one is able to do in many other languages.<br />This is not a textbook, although it does pack a lot of serious information and linguistic discussions of the technical aspects of language.  In a few chapters, Bryson relies too much on long lists to show his examples.  This wears only a little and is buffeted by his humor throughout.  Particularly interesting and enjoyable are his discourses on swearing, word games and improbable place names (like Maggies' Nipples, a town in Wyoming and Coldass Creek, located in North Carolina).<br />This book is very enjoyable and informative.rmative.	2002-01-15

This book has far too many recitations of Bryson's breakfasts, lunches, dinners and teas.  We are regaled nightly with a critique of the room, hotel and appointments of is current lodgings.<br />I had one moment of irony.  Toward the end of the book, the author stated that it was getting difficult to get up to see places during the latter stages of his trip.  He allowed that this was because British towns all had a degree of sameness in their Marks and Spencer's stores, corner pubs and British Rail stations.  His writing struck me the same way.  Too many of his landings featured a walk up a dreary main street, a meal of indian cuisine that was less than satisfying and a stay in a room that failed to meet his expectation.  I wondered if the author's editor was struck by this congruence of story and story pace.<br />His more recent books, &quot;A Walk in the Woods,&quot; and &quot;In a Sunburnt Country&quot; featured much more insightful writing.  In these books, Bryson told the history, background and odd tidbit about the places he visited.  The meals, motels and transport were background that filled out rather interesting place descriptions.<br />In this book, Bryson reverses the emphasis.  The result is an account where Bryson is the main focus rather than the places he is describing.<br />That doesn't mean that this book is without some interesting moments or amusing passages.  Bryson is, after all, an engaging writer.  It just seems that in this effort he set out to write a quickie book that relied heavily on his notes and too lightly on the place research that makes some of his other offerings amusing and fascinating learning experiences.s amusing and fascinating learning experiences.	2001-12-28

This book is not a complete history of the conflict and does not intend to be.  For the reader who has an understanding of the basics of the war, this fine collection will serve to illuminate little known aspects and operations as well as introduce topics that can be explored in greater depth by other books.<br />I personally was fascinated by several of the articles. There is a gripping account of the retreat from Bataan and the stoic majesty of General King who had to surrender the American forces in the Philippines.  Caleb Carr writes a good account of the German invasion of Poland that gives more credit to the Poles than readers usually find.  Likewise the articles on Stalingrad and the Turning Points of Tarawa are interesting.  John Keegan does his usual masterful work in an account of the Battle of Berlin.<br />But the stories that one usually doesn't hear about are the real treats.  Paul Kemp reveals one of the Italian success stories in Decima Mas, about a waterborn sabatouge unit that was successful in sinking and damaging significant British shipping in the Mediterranian.  I had not been aware of this unit at all before this book.  Also new to me were descriptions of a Nazi automated weather station landed in North America on the coast of Labrador and the tale of a Soviet offensive contemporary to the Stalingrad encirlement that was a large failure and cost Stalin 500,000 men.  Descriptions of the reaction in Tokyo to Pearl Harbor on December 8th, an account of Orde Wingate's Chindits, the story of the Channel Dash by German naval surface ships, the successful raid that destroyed the Nazi heavy water factory in Norway, the diary of a B-17 tail gunner and the account of a Kamikaze pilot who survived his mission are fascinating.<br />With it's varied topics, first class authors and relatively short articles, this book should not boor the history buff and will probably introduce all but the professional military historians of the period to new information and fascinating stories of World War II.his mission are fascinating.<br />With it's varied topics, first class authors and relatively short articles, this book should not boor the history buff and will probably introduce all but the professional military historians of the period to new information and fascinating stories of World War II.	2001-12-06

This book focuses entirely on the national strategies and the decision makers of the Allied and Axis forces at each of the stages of the war.<br />The author examines the situation and options of each player based on information known to the decision makers at the time.  This forms a picture that is probably as accurate as history can be of why decisions were made and how the patterns of decisions fit into the grand strategies for each nation.  Thus, the book unfolds chronologically and focuses on the logic of campaigns, diplomacy, economics and objectives.<br />I found this book utterly fascinating.  At almost a thousand pages, it can appear daunting.  However, WWII is such a large topic, that most readers will find the pace moving along swiftly with the right balance of background and detail as well as descriptions of decisions implemented and actions taken.<br />We see the unfolding of the alliance between the allies. Often strained, and with a lack of trust between the Western allies and the Soviet Union, the alliance was, however, the crucial factor in defeating Germany.  In contrast, the Axis failed to have a working alliance in anything but name only -- Italy and Germany often took great pains to &quot;surprise&quot; each other early in the war and technological and strategic cooperation that could have mutually benefited Japan and Germany/Italy in their wars was (fortunately) greatly lacking.<br />Of particular interest is the role Stalin plays.  First, he is an eager co-conspirator of Hitler's -- wanting to join the Tripartite Powers up to the moment of Operation Barbarossa.  Then, he becomes the bulwark of the Allied effort -- tying up more German troops by far on the Eastern Front than were engaged against the West -- as he pursues first survival and then Soviet dominance in the post-war world.<br />The American - British relationship also had its strains, though it proved to still be a remarkably cohesive and productive partnership.  I was not aware of the great lengths to which the British tried to dissuade a return to France through a cross-channel invasion.  Also interesting was the cabinet debate during the fall of France in 1940 regarding whether or not Britain should reach an accommodation with Germany.  I had not been aware that the decision to fight on was an open question with more than a few of the key British policy makers at the time.<br />It is chilling to read the logic of Hitler's actions and plans as they unfold early in the war.  Until he bit off more than he could chew (the Soviet Union), Hitler's aggressive war making -- driven particularly by his belief in fast action -- was working as nations individually fell under German domination pretty much according to plan (the exception being of course Great Britain.  However, it can be argued that a Germany occupying continental Europe in the west and at peace with the Soviet Union would potentially have remade Europe for a very long time).<br />Japanese strategy and decision making is also explored, though not in as many pages as the events in Europe.  The Japanese were perhaps dominated even more than the Germans by beliefs in their own superiority and ability to secure an empire through the some sort of \\"karma\\" or &quot;Japanese Spirit.&quot;  At least the Germans tried to develop new weapons and styles of warfare to quickly put down enemies who they knew could out produce them in a long war.  The Japanese on the other hand were remarkably bereft of strategic insight when they decided to go to war over natural resources they probably could have secured through trade and intimidation.  After securing raw materials in far away islands, they still had the great problem of transporting them home for use.  There is evidence the Japanese knew of the great productive capabilities of America innaval tonnage vis a vis their own relatively paltry abilities to lay new keels in a warship building contest.  Arguably, the Japanese could have achieved much of what they wanted by not attacking an America that did not want to go to war and forcing colonial outposts of German occupied nations to trade raw materials with them.  Then, while at war they utterly failed to appreciate any offensive role for submarines (as the Germans had) and failed to provide for or protect adequately their water borne trade and movement of materials or troops.  They also failed miserably in coordinating their armed forces.  The army and navy pretty much had veto power over use of their own units in combined operations and no structure emerged to bind them toward a single military purpose.<br />This focus on the big picture is as expected very light on battle analysis.  Battles are mostly described only to the extent they reveal the outcomes of strategic decisions and as they impact future options and realities.  Therefore, this is not a book where the reader will smell the smoke of battle or feel the cold of the Russian Steppe.  The reader spends much more time in conference rooms and command centers than rifle pits as one would expect in a book examining strategy.  Perhaps this explains why the book has no theater or battle maps.  The only criticism of the book I would make is that a map section would help the reader who is not familiar enough with the geography of the war to make mental maps as needed.<br />I have not come across a more richly researched or well-articulated description of the Second World War at the strategic level.  This is a feast for history buffs and those who want to understand why World War II unfolded as it did.

Lee Kennett is an excellent historian who combines exhaustive research with a splendid narrative pace in his &quot;Marching Through Georgia.&quot;<br />This is not a book about Sherman's military campaign through the Peach State.  The battles and maneuvers provide only the backdrop.  The story is of the common soldiers who fought with and against Sherman and the citizens of Georgia who endured both armies during 1864.<br />The author makes heavy use of diaries and first person accounts.

Great book the Kids really love.<br />A simple story of a family going on a bear hunt, going through difficult hikes (grass, winter storm, forrest, cave), finding the bear and then retreating AS FAST AS POSSIBLE! Good for the 2-5 age group.<br />Going on a Bear Hunt is more than a story.  It's a rhythmic chant that gets the kids involved in the story.  My mom taught this to my gang before we got the book.  They love sitting around in a circle making the &quot;swoosh, swoosh&quot; sound of going through the grass, the &quot;oooohhhhh, oooohhhhh&quot; sound of the winter storm, the &quot;squelch, squish&quot; sound of going through the mud.<br />A good one for reading aloud to a bunch of kids.	2001-10-01

It's late in the period -- the frontier's closed, Indian wars and giant buffalo herds almost petered out, but there's still plenty of &quot;bad&quot; in the West.<br />When Joey Garza starts holding up trains along the Mexican border area, the railroad decides to stop him.  Captain Call, an old Texas Ranger, is called upon to help make the Texas Panhandle safe again, as he has spent a career doing.<br />This &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; sequel works well as a stand alone.  McMurty gives enough back ground to his characters and their stories that the reader will not be hampered if they did not read his great &quot;Lonesome Dove.&quot;<br />Those of us who found Lonesome Dove a wonderful companion, will enjoy this book also.  Captain Call is older, Pea Eye much more prominent and other characters either dead or moved on -- just as in real life.  This book is very much a woman's story.  All of the strong characters, that is strong in mental, moral and physical manner, are women.  It is not too much to say that women drive this story forward and are the most complete and interesting characters in the book.  The male characters tend to be mean, scary, determined or loyal, but usually are lacking in some other important component of personality and being.<br />Women characters played a prominent role in Lonesome Dove also, but they were also balanced by the Gus McCrea lead.  Gus died at the end of Lonesome Dove, which takes the one strong male lead (who was strong in many dimensions) out of the story.  McMurty does not replace him with any of his new cowboys, judges or villians who join the tale of the west in this book.  It is not too much to say in this book that the men react, while the female characters think and act.<br />This is a good yarn that moves quickly and contains enough twists to keep you reading at fifty and seventy-five page clips.  I do agree with the reviewers who say this in not &quot;Lonesome Dove,&quot; but hey, that book was a Pulitzer Prize winning masterpiece.

In the &quot;Face of Battle,&quot; both traits are on display.<br />Keegan looks at three battles where England bled -- Agincourt, Waterloo and The Somme -- to discover what it is like to do battle in the age of edged weapons, musketry and industrial warfare.<br />His battle synopses are excellent.  Keegan does a masterful job of explaining in a very few pages why the combatants were there, the battle plan and the actual fighting.  He then goes on to analyze different components of the battle (archer against man at arms, artillery versus infantry, machine gun versus infantry), to discern what it was like to fight and how the battle was waged based on the types of weaponry engaged.  Always, Keegan is driving to answer the question &quot;What wills men to battle?&quot;<br />I'd have to say that he does an admirable job of answering that question as well as giving a pretty good ground level look at what it was like to fight in the three different ages of arms he inspects.<br />Still, I have to say that I respected this book rather than liked it.  The framework and analysis are original and Keegan is very sharp and well reasoned, as well as a fairly good writer.  However, the book is professorial in it's presentation.  Often, Keegan will digress during his analysis, meandering like a seminar lecturer through different currents of thought that pop into his head or flow from the questions of his rapt students.  While this can work in the classroom, on the printed page it tends to interfere with the task at hand.<br />I also found the first seventy odd pages....well, odd.  Keegan spends the first quarter of the book expounding on the topic of historiagraphy.  His treatise on the writing of history was useful, but very much overblown for the book.  Instead of seventy pages, he could have easily made his point (his point being that writer's of history can not possibly sum up all that happens in battle and that critical examination of many celebrated battle narratives reveals them to be over simplified and lacking in significant detail) in a ten or twenty page preface.  I found it curious that this &quot;publish or perish&quot; style academic deconstruction of the science of battle narrative was stuck on the beginning of this book.  It belongs in an academic journal.<br />So what I found was an original and at times fascinating examination of what it has been like to battle through the ages...marred by digression and professional cant.  I felt Keegan couldn't quite decide if he was a popular writer or an academic star in this tome.  Still, I greatly respect Keegan's analysis and ability to tell the story of battle.  It is so strong, that it overcomes the criticisms I've levied in the paragraphs above.  This is my first read of his, but the book was written in the 1960's and I believe was his first effort at writing for those of us who don't wear tweed on a daily basis.  I intend to check out later Keegan works - presumably he's become more comfortable with being accessible as a writer (judging by the praise for his other works).battle and that critical examination of many celebrated battle narratives reveals them to be over simplified and lacking in significant detail) in a ten or twenty page preface.

The payoff for our southern neighbor:  the restoration of Texas, Arizona and New Mexico to the country of Mexico.<br />This very fine book is many facets tightly woven in 200 pages:  British code breakers.  German diplomatic efforts. President Wilson's unshakable will for neutrality.  Mexican and Japanese intrigue.  Submarine warfare.  Mexican revolution and America's chase for Pancho Villa.<br />The story has drama (the fight to persuade Wilson that US interests lay with the Allies and not in being a neutral broker of peace), excitement (British code breaking efforts and the intrigue to get the telegram published / into American hands), and near comedy (German bungling with codes, diplomatic missions and high strategy)written by the masterful Barbara Tuchman.<br />The author takes all these elements -- which are almost Shakespearean in their complexity and interplay -- and crafts a terrifically exciting history.  A very fine read.	2001-09-13

It is a little book, the kind you are more likely to pick up and browse, than read through from beginning to end.<br />The editor has conveniently arranged TR's missives by topic.  The reader will find our most energetic president holding forth on politics, foreign affairs, voting, citizenship, family, children, motherhood, Lincoln, virtue, boxing, war, and himself among the categories.

Ambrose tells an absorbing tale of what the war was like to men who fought it. I could not put it down.<br />This book is a good compliment to Ambrose's &quot;Citizen Soldiers.&quot; In that book, Ambrose takes a look at the condition of the G.I. in Europe as a whole. While offering interesting personal accounts, it is intended as a survey of all soldiers and as such is somewhat impersonal (although very good).<br />Band of Brothers, on the other hand, is intimate and personal. By following one command (E Co., 506 / 101st Airborne) across France and into Germany, we get to see a discrete group of soldiers adjust to changing conditions brought on by different seasons, terrain, offensive and defensive actions, their own increasing battle savvy and fatigue. I like this approach. By personalizing the experience of a few front-line soldiers, the impact on the reader is enhanced because one comes to know the characters. They are not just &quot;some soldiers who experienced frost bite,&quot; they are individuals we've come to know who looked with the pride of conquerors as they stood in Hitler's Eagle's Nest, a fitting end to their fatigue, loss and heroics in liberating a continent.<br />This outfit in particular offers lots of adventure, which is I am sure why Ambrose chose them. Part of the 101st Airborne, E Co., was at Utah Beach, the Battle of Arnhem, the Battle of the Bulge, helped liberate a concentration camp in addition to securing Hitler's Bavarian retreat. As we get to know these Americans through their battles and experiences, we more fully appreciate how our &quot;regular guys&quot; helped conquer self-designed supermen bent on world domination.<br />This book moves very quickly, is highly entertaining and moving.

Thank goodness this was not my first, for I probably would not have picked up &quot;In a Sunburned Country,&quot; and &quot;A Walk In The Woods.&quot;<br />Where Bryson's latest books are droll, witty and endearing, &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; is frequently petty, forced and mean.  In this book Bryson travels around 38 states in a beat up Chevette, often through small towns and out of the way places not usually visited by many.  He didn't have a very good trip.<br />Most of this book revolves around the author's put-downs of people he sees and caustic comments about places he visits.  After a few hundred pages, the observations seem awfully gratuitous.  Where disappointments, angst and difficult people were treated with amusement in his later books, here he often dismisses similar trials here with the brilliant and trenchant observation &quot;FU&quot;.  Not much authorship in those moments.<br />Not to say that there aren't some funny passages.  Several times on the train, I found myself reading out loud.  However, I also found myself speed reading ahead several times, an unfortunate first for a Bryson Book.  Bryson's later works also weave a good deal of interesting historical background and place descriptions into the book.  That is almost totally missing in this effort.<br />He occasionally comes up with some awfully good writing.  For example, he described driving toward the mountains in Colorado as &quot;driving into the opening credits of a Paramount Picture.&quot; (sic).  Unfortunately, there are not enough of those moments and instead too many paragraphs describing how he had another bad meal in another bad town with too many ice cream and pizza parlors and not enough ambiance or fetching waitresses to suit his tastes.  Bryson has produced much better.  But don't let this book (or review) put you off an author whose books can be very satisfying companions.  Just go for his more recent stuff.	2001-09-06

He mixes in first person and newspaper accounts with his overview to give the book a good balance between the general's view and the soldier's view of the battle.<br />He also develops interesting information.  Particularly enlightening was his description of Condederate General Albert Sidney Johnston, the commander who was killed on the first day of the battle.  McDonough makes a pretty convincing argument that Johnston fell far short of the image that many give him in contemporary and historical writings.  He is usually portrayed as an experienced and decisive commander of men.  This book shows that Johnston was really a man of modest war and command experience who rose to prominence shortly before the Civil War when his good friend (then) Sec. of War Jefferson Davis made him a Colonel of the 2nd US Cavalry out of friendship more than anything else.  His actions (or inactions) prior to the meeting at Shiloh -- for example offering to let his subordinate Beaureguard take command -- reveal a man who had difficulty managing the responsibility fostered on him by his command<br />The author does a good job of presenting several other historical  questions / problems like Johnston's reputation vs. reality that really add a lot of interest to the pages.  There were some uneven parts, particulalry when he was listing units fighting at various stages of the battle, that seem less well developed than some of the background and &quot;big picture&quot; parts of the book.  Overall, a solidly written and good presentation of the battle.	2001-09-03

Should Settle Debate on How US Ended War	Richard Frank has produced one heck of a piece of history and historical analysis with &quot;Downfall.&quot; His book examines the end of World War II in the Pacific from a policy perspective. In this superb treatise, he seeks to answer the questions surrounding our strategy to end the war, including the change in air bombardment strategy culminating with incendiary attacks on Japanese urban areas as well as the decision to use atomic weapons. This is also the story of the end of the war, focusing on how the diplomatic, governmental and military players felt their way toward the cessation of hostilities. He pays particular attention to the situation in Japan, which is fascinating reading. Planning for our invasion (operations Olympic and Coronet) of the home islands, as well as Japanese defense strategies and preparations are covered. He gives background of Japan's suicide weapons programs, the Manhattan project and a host of other historical occurrences associated with the time. Not only is he thorough, but his writing is tight and interesting. This is a book any history fan will both thoroughly enjoy and praise as a piece of scholarship. Franks is meticulous in his research and presentation of evidence. Using American sources (including ULTRA and MAGIC cryptology reports) as well as Japanese, he conducts his analysis from the vantage point of what decision makers on both sides understood as facts and assumptions contemporaneously to their actions. This is significant because so many of these type of &quot;did they get it right&quot; books fail to separate hindsight when critiquing events of the past. I have read a fair amount of World War II history and was impressed with the new information developed by the author. This is true particularly surrounding the situation and assessments on the Japanese side. In &quot;Downfall,&quot; the author is successful in taking the reader into the inner councils of Japanese leadership, including the Emperor. I arrived at this book already convinced that Truman made the right decision in dropping the bombs. Franks analysis supports this position. Throughout his book, he buttresses his case by demolishing arguments made over the last several decades that the Japanese would have surrendered without the atomic bombs or that casualty figures relating to the invasion of Japan were wildly overestimated. Much of this revisionist thinking has focused on discrete pieces of MAGIC or ULTRA communications or the actions of individual Japanese diplomats overseas. Franks takes more than a few of these counter-arguments head on and demonstrates that the data upon which they rest is either taken out of context, contradicted by much more contemporary evidence, or did not originate from a policy maker that mattered. Frank's basic conclusion, for which he leaves no doubt through his evidentiary presentation, is that the Japanese would not have surrendered absent the two atomic bombings. Even after Hiroshima, critical Japanese decision-makers thought our country only possessed one bomb and/or that we could not stomach another attack. American leadership also believed that we faced huge losses among US troops through a direct attack on the Home Islands. Even had the invasions been successful, the experience on Saipan and Okinawa foretold huge casualties among a fanatical Japanese civilian population, and a corresponding large loss of our soldiers. It was also very unclear that the million plus Japanese soldiers who were in Burma, China, Indo-China and many islands in the Pacific (and inflicting tens of thousands of casualties per month on civilians - primarily Chinese), would have surrendered even had the Home Islands been wrestled from the Imperial Army. There was a real possibility, as Sec. of Defense Stimson noted, that we faced &quot;twenty Okinawas&quot; even after the successful battle for Japan proper. Truman saved not only many American lives, but also Japanese and Asian lives.<br />Franks demonstratesthat, even in hindsight, American leadership could not have made more appropriate decisions than those made at the time to meet our objectives of 1). bringing the war to a speedy conclusion, 2). minimizing American casualties 3). minimizing other casualties, and 4). ensuring that Japan would not rise, like Germany after WWI, to present the next generation with &quot;their world war.&quot; A very good book.that, even in hindsight, American leadership could not have made more appropriate decisions than those made at the time to meet our objectives of 1). bringing the war to a speedy conclusion, 2). minimizing American casualties 3). minimizing other casualties, and 4). ensuring that Japan would not rise, like Germany after WWI, to present the next generation with &quot;their world war.&quot; A very good book.	2001-08-28

As he's the basketball player/authority in the family (although I might note that none other than Bill Bradley did advise him once -- in writing -- that he needed to work on his inside game), I thought I'd read this book to see if the inside Knight story would change my inability to appreciate Knight's methods. Here's my conclusion. If you buy the notion that sport/basketball is war, then Knight's methods make some sense. In the same vein that Patton made a lot of sense for the army. (Knight is, by the way a big Patton fan). You didn't have to want Patton to be the godfather to your children to appreciate that his methods meant a shorter war, less American casualties and a quicker victory. Of course, Omar Bradley, who was by all accounts a pretty decent human being, was also a great war commander. However, war, unlike basketball, has no rules, no timeouts, and doesn't end with a buzzer, but when one side is willing to cry uncle. During my reading of Alford's book, I was constantly wondering if another coach could have been as successful with Indy's players if he had taken a positive approach to motivation as opposed to Knight's very negative mode. I don't know enough about John Wooden to know if he was a decent person to his players, but he certainly took a very positive approach to motivating his team and had more success than Knight has enjoyed. But, you have to admit that Knight gets the job done. This book doesn't go into the questions I've ruminated on above, but chronicles Steve's Alford's four years with Bobby Knight. This sanitized version (Alford admits he deleted Knight's trademark profanity in his recollections), gives a pretty good inside picture of what it's like &quot;playing for Knight.&quot; I did feel the title is somewhat misleading, the book is really the Steve Alford story, and details his life / basketball career. His approach to the game and psyche were so dominated by Coach Knight that the IU helmsman does dominate the book. Alford takes an anecdotal approach to the telling -- playing for Knight before or after Alford's time is not explored. This is rather like a diary of Alford's life, the biggest chapters being his IU years. One winds up with a rich tale (Knight's antics, although somewhat repetitive, are so outrageous that they do make for pretty interesting reading) that's a quick read.

Particularly interesting are the descriptions of the life of your average villager and the social structures of the English and Normans.  This look at the era's &quot;every man&quot; gives a depth of perspective to the significant political events that would spring from that year.<br />Enough history and background is given to produce what seems to be a very satisfactory and full account of why William decided on this most perilous of adventures.  It is also the story of how and why Harold and the English were smitten in battle and later in spirit.  So demoralized were they that the English leadership gave up the realm to a comparatively few foreign invaders who were stranded far from home with winter approaching.<br />The author does a very good job of focusing on the many pieces of the story.  I was not aware that William carried the banner and the blessing of the Pope with him to Hastings -- a fact that the author makes a convincing case of in terms of it's psychological effect on Harold and the English gentry.  In fact, he credits this aspect of the story with being crucial to Harold's position during the battle and the willingness of much of England to assign some role to God in the defeat of their king.<br />Because this story is so old, much is left to conjecture or at least competing accounts.  The author does a good job of pointing out these elusive facts and in building a case for what he sees as the most likely or plausible happenings.  He always points out when he is engaging in deduction so that the reader is aware of what is known and what is assumed.  Most of these situations are well deduced from the evidence presented in the book and I found myself in agreement with the author's presentation of the most likely set of facts, given what we know of the actors.<br />This is a great story.  The book covers the reign and death of Edward the Confessor, the place of the Godwin's (including Harold) during this period, William's rise and reason for thinking he had a claim on the crown and the Norsemen's injection into the story.  What a fascinating piece of history.  Luck played a big part in William's landing, and eventual success.  As the author tells it, almost everything broke his way and against Harold.

I liked this book.<br />Stephen King writes well, a point that will seem obvious to any one who counts himself a fan.<br />The Green Mile is an absorbing, escapist tale.  King's character portraits are strong, particularly the conflicted &quot;good man&quot; Paul Edgecomb, as he wrestles with good and evil in this engrossing tale.  The pace is quick and the story is a rich mix of twists and turns and a very interesting morality tale.<br />Set in 1932 at Cold Mountain prison, the story surrounds Edgecomb, the boss of that prison's death row.  He has participated in the execution of over seventy men, all poster children for the death penalty.  Then giant John Coffey, a simpleton possessed with a special grace arrives on E Block to await his walk down the Green Mile (the linoleum tiled floor leading to Old Sparky).

He is also less revered.  Ferling spends several hundred pages laying out the life and achievements of a man who was also crucial to our fight for independence and the survival of our Republic.<br />Adams was a prodigious diary keeper, and also a mostly honest one, if we are to judge honesty by self criticism and the ability to write about one's own perceived short-comings.  This first-person material is a tremendous asset to compiling the President's life story, and one that Ferling puts to good use.  The book uses ample quotes to reveal Adam's feelings about personalities and events of his day.  Ferling has studied the diaries thoroughly, as shown by his ability to draw on portions from different times in Adam's life to illustrate points or show how Adams changed his views over time.  The danger with such a diary based biography is that the diaries can become the book.  Ferling does not make this mistake.  His ample writing skills utilizes the diaries to illustrate his story and argue his interpretations of his subject's life and actions.<br />Also useful to the author is that Adams enjoyed a fascinating life.  He touched all the great (and not so great) Revolutionary personalities, served for years as a foreign diplomat, was present at the birth of our Government and served as president.  Also remarkable, was his relationship with Abigail, an unusual colonial wife who was educated, opinionated and enjoyed a marriage as very nearly an equal partner (highly unusual in those days).  Their correspondence and relationship sustained Adams and show how she helped ground this great man of American nationhood.<br />How does Ferling judge Adams?  His assessment is that Adams belongs among the greats of the American founding.  This book's thorough telling of Adams's public life to make a pretty good case for Ferlings argument.<br />There are many fascinating aspects I found in the story.  Adams tremendous dislike of Franklin is telling as to their different styles as well as Adams's thirst for approbation.  His long and difficult relationship with Jefferson, culminating in their famous correspondence is another gem.  Also interesting, is Adams's actions during his presidency when he stood alone against his party and long term political interests in keeping us out of war with France.  It was a crucial decision that perhaps saved our Republic, given the potential for the European powers to divvy up a weak America should they have decided to play their rivalries here.<br />Adams lived a fascinating life and was a thoroughly interesting personality.

John McCain has a compelling story based upon the example of his father and grandfather (both admirals) and his years spent as a prisoner of the North Vietnamese.<br />This is a book about family, honor and surviving tortuous trials unimaginable to almost everyone else on the planet.  Scion of a long line of Americans who have served our country in our armed forces, McCain's service was perhaps inescapable.  Simply, he was bred for it and never questioned that he would wear an American uniform.  His most immediate examples were his grandfather, a four star admiral whose carrier task force helped crush Japanese naval strength in the last year of the war, and his father, another four star admiral who (ironically) was CINCPAC during McCain's last years of captivity.<br />The first half of the book covers the careers of father and grandfather and illustrates the family code that serves as a lodestar for the author.  Both admiral McCains were salty men who valued personal honor, duty and the primacy of naval service above all else in their lives.  They also shared a strong father-son bond, one which McCain was to also experience, although his internalization of his own father's presence does not seem to reach the levels experienced between the father and grandfather.<br />What makes this book compelling are McCain's prisoner of war experiences.  Tortured, maimed, neglected and challenged by the North Vietnamese, McCain resisted and survived with his honor intact.  The details of the privations he suffered (and those suffered by his fellow POW's) are fascinating reading, and serve to honor the men who wore our country's uniforms behind enemy lines and were asked to sacrifice far beyond what they had expected.<br />The themes of honor and duty run throughout the book and in places alight upon almost every page.  Without the incredible personal tests to which McCain's honor and sense of duty were put, their emphasis could seem cynical and dismissed as simplistic patriotism.  No one reading the book will doubt that the easy road for prisoner McCain would have been to abandon his honor and duty to relieve his physical and mental sufferings (nor wonder whether they themselves could have held on to such principals were they in his place).  I doubt anyone will be less than impressed and honored that such men as McCain agree to serve our country and fight our wars.<br />This is a good book with a compelling story that will cause you to think about the meaning, and true tests of, honor and duty.ook and in places alight upon almost every page.

In &quot;Ship of Gold&quot; he weaves two different stories into an exciting adventure book.<br />The Central America was a two-wheeled steam ship carrying Californians and a large shipment of gold from Panama to New York in 1857. Beset by a hurricane off the coast of Georgia, she sank with a loss of 400 of her five hundred passengers. About a third of the book recounts the voyage of the ship, its growing impairment in the storm, eventual sinking and the rescue of survivors. Using many first person accounts, this sea story is as exciting as any of the recent spate of &quot;true adventure&quot; books that have hit the shelves in the last decade.<br />Most of the book is given over the story of Tommy Thompson, dreamer, visionary and treasure hunter. We learn the life story of a young man who possesses an engineers ability to tinker, Franklin's persistence, inventiveness and curiosity, Rockefeller's business acumen and enough personal idiosyncrasies to drive many who have worked with him to distraction. Thompson dreams of working in deep oceans, recovering, maneuvering and exploring at depths not worked by anyone else. The work he wants to do is sunken ship recovery.<br />The Central America is his target. Lying off of the Continental shelf, she is miles down. That depth has ensured, however, that she is unplundered, which can not be said about most wrecks laying in shallow waters that are the usual targets of treasure hunters. The problem is that the whereabouts of the Central America are unknown, and the means to find her and - if found - recover her treasure do not yet exist.<br />Most of the story focuses on Thompson's creating everything needed to pursue his vision. He and his team research the Central America until they know it inside and out. They conceive of and invent the technological means of carrying out the search and recovering objects from the deep. They enlist sonar technology that can sweep likely swaths of the ocean in which their ship might lay. They hire experts to take the information they have and project possible locations of the ship. They identify, pursue and convince the wealthy of Columbus, Ohio to back their venture. The Tommy Thompson story is the story of an entrepreneur living the American &quot;pluck and luck&quot; ideal and conquering new frontiers.<br />Actual ocean operations involve many challenges - pursuit by other treasure hunters, rough seas, technological breakdowns, false targets and frustration by financial partners looking for quick results. The story of Thompson at sea in search of the Central America is quick paced and surprisingly suspenseful given the fact that it really is the story of some guys on a modern ship with expensive technology conducting search and salvage operations.<br />But that is the worth of the book. Kinder renders the Tommy Thompson story very well and manages to create believable suspense without being overwrought. He does an outstanding job of weaving a white-knuckle sea disaster with a modern tale of entrepreneurism into a pretty good book. My only complaint is that at times he becomes almost worshipful of Thompson and does spend a lot of time detailing his habits, history and person -- more than you usually want to know in this type of book. But it's a credit to the author's writing skill that this hagiographic element does not distract too much from a suspenseful and interesting tale.n in which their ship might lay.

I imagine most Americans would think the above title reflected historical fiction rather than fact.<br />The fact is that most contemporay Americans thought the Burning of Washington would live on forever in the American mind as an ignoble moment of shame and humiliation.  That it has largely been forgotten is a testament to how America has changed and grown since 1814 -- rendering what has become one of our \\"little wars\\" largely to the history books with an occasional reprieve when the Star Spangled Banner is considered.  It is worth considering that President Madison is remembered today as the father of the Constitution, and not as the rascal who allowed the White House and the Capitol to be burned by a foreign army during a war so ineptly fought by our side.  I imagine that had this occurred in any number of other countries, his moment of singular presidential humiliation would attach itself more largely to his name.  We remain an optimistic people.<br />Anthony S. Pitch has written a very good account of the British occupation and sacking of Washington, D.C. in his book \\"The Burning of Washington.  The British Invasion of 1814.\\"  The author makes good use of contemporary sources and observations from American and British combatants as well as civilians.  The background is sketched well enough to allow the reader to understand why the British stood at the mouth of the Potomac River ready to invade our capitol city.  Personalities of American and British commanders as well as President Madison and especially Secretary of War John Armstrong - to whom can be attributed the immediate blame for Washington's unprepardness - are well summarized to give the reader a good feel for how individuals affected the events covered in the book.<br />The story covers the Battle of Bladensburg, the march on and occupation of Washington, the burning of the public buildings (focusing on the Capitol and White House), as well as the British attempt to take Baltimore, which failed before the walls of Ft. McHenry.  Francis Scott Key's penning of our national anthem is also covered, as well as the British retreat.  The book ends with summaries of the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the war, as well as Jackson's incredibly lopsided victory over Gen. Packenham before New Orleans.<br />All in all this is a good and interesting book.  The author keeps the pace moving while giving enough detail to both satisfy curiosity as to why events are unfolding as they did as well as add the flavor and feel that can come from a judicious use of diary entries and contemporary accounts.  I recommend this to any history buff who would like to know more about a now overlooked -- but still astonishing - part of American history.e the walls of Ft. McHenry.

Format Works Best On -- TV	This is a hit and miss book.  An easy read, O'Reilly has penned a world view in the same quick in and out format that makes his TV show interesting and fast paced.<br />The problem is that the format -- which works very well on T.V. --- seems shallow and thin in book form.  It reminded me of reading a television script.  You might love the Seinfeld show but it makes much less impact in script form.<br />I genuinely like O'Reilly's show and agree with him on a lot of issues.  On tv, he is very good at not allowing guests to wiggle or spin their way past hard questions.  It's the best part of his show.  Unfortunately, the book doesn't allow him to exercise his trademark skill, primarily because he's interviewing himself on these pages.<br />The twelve or so chapters delve into broad life topics.  Everything from fornification to dating to children to politics, race and the media are given an eight to twenty page treatment in a fast style.  Some are better chapters than others.  Unfortunately the first few were the weakest and almost caused me to put down the book.  O'Reilly begins by ranting about what \\"they\\" are doing to the average guy (financially and socially) and sounds more like a shrill conspiracy theorist than  the reasoned voice he can be.  It gets better.  Surprisingly (to me), some of his best chapters deal with child rearing and male-female relationships.  He had one or two sections on advice to kids that I re-read because they struck me as very well reasoned and succinct positive messages for keeping kids functioning with in parental expectations.<br />So what you get is a very quick book that doesn't dawdle to long on any one subject.  Some topics are better than others, which makes for an uneven read.  But you do get the unvarnished O'Reilly, just like you see on TV.  His presentation just works better on the tube than in print.	2001-07-12

The author does an outstanding job of weaving interesting facts about Australians, the continent, it's cities, landscapes, flora, fauna and history with the sites and people he meets on his jaunt around the country.<br />It's the small things that make this book interesting. Like Bryson's visit to a building shaped like a giant lobster (one of fifty creature-shaped buildings that populate the country we discover). Or his wonderment at the case of a woman who was gobbled up by a salt-water crocodile while wading in knee deep water. Or the Great Barrier Reef snorkeling expedition that recently forgot two American tourists and left them thirty odd miles out at sea at the end of the day. Or the fact that Australia is possibly the only country to have lost a sitting prime minister in the surf. Or the fact that many desert explorers resort to drinking their own urine (mentioned more than several times) as a last resort and that this only makes thirst increase.<br />Add to this descriptions of major cities, physical attractions like Ayer's Rock, the great deserts and bushlands, everyday Australians whom he encounters and the minor irritations associated with living out of a suitcase for weeks at a time and you've got a very enjoyable book.	2001-07-08

It is a gripping and well written story that will keep you fixed to the pages of this fine book.<br />The first chapter is searing and just about the saddest piece of history I've ever read.  The massacre of American prisoners at Palawan tipped the US Army to the danger faced by other POW's operating under a Japanese policy of prisoner annihilation as the Empire's prospects faded late in the war.  Knowing that 500 prisoners were at the Phillipine camp Cabanatuan ahead of the US Sixth Army unleashed what is perhaps the war's most dramatic rescue mission in early 1945.<br />Hampton Sides is a good writer who knows how to keep a story moving.  He weaves back and forth between the prisoners and their Ranger rescuers withoug breaking the story pace.  He also traces the history of the prisoner's experiences under Japanese authority.  The sadistic barbarity with which the captors treated American prisoners is amazing for its uniformity.  Sides brings enough of Japanese culture and military training into the story to show how almost everyone from top commanders to lowly prison guards were perhaps predisposed to the atrocities that visited our soldiers with stunning regularity through their long months of starvation and neglect.<br />The threads of the story come together nicely with a climatic battle scene that will glue your attention to the pages.<br />This is a well written story that deserves to be remembered both as a testament to the barbarity of the war-era Japanese army and the heroics of POW survival and American arms.	2001-06-25

Not only has Robert Knox Sneden penned a highly descriptive account of his years with the Army of the Potomac and as a prisoner of war, his work is illustrated with scores of his own watercolors depicting what he saw -- many made at the time he was witnessing places and events during the war.<br />Sneden had an unusual vantage point.  An engineer and draftsman, Sneden's services were employed as a map maker for several Union Generals during the first two and a half years of the war.  Although a private, this posting gave him an easier life than experienced by most privates.  Although in the field, Sneden was attached to headquarters.  His staff position and duties also gave him considerable free time -- from which we benefit.  Sneden used this time to record his observations in both written form and via sketches and watercolor renderings of war scenes.<br />Sneden's posting was not without difficulty or danger.  Several times he had to reconnoiter close to the enemy or between the lines in order gather the information needed for accurate local maps.  He was also asked to journey over recently fought over battlefields to aid in the construction of after-action reports -- after the Union army had left and local control had reverted to Confederate partisans.<br />On one such journey away from the main army, Sneden and a few of his companions were captured by Mosby's Rangers.  Sneden then began his journey through the Confederate prisoner of war system staying in Richmond, Andersonville and several other locations.<br />His experiences are well written.  Sneden has a very matter of fact style of writing that gets to the point and is descriptive without being overwrought.  Having read &quot;Company Ayche&quot; by Sam Watkins and &quot;All for the Union&quot; by Elisha Hunt Rhodes, I would rank Sneden's work as highly among Civil War remembrances.  His unique position enables him to comment on battlefield and camp experiences in all their gritty detail as well as those portions of the Union high command with whom he came in contact. His prisoner of war writing reveals the brutal realities of life at Andersonville and other locations.  The raw and inhumane world of these men is given testamony by Sneden in his gripping account of what he and others bore.<br />The artwork illustrates the text well.  Although probably considered somewhat rough strictly as art, it is poignant and captivating.  His original maps are also fascinating as historical documents.<br />This is a very good book.  The war and prison scenes are engaging and very interesting.  The author's style is highly readible and very convincing in terms of giving a front line view of army and prison life.  The plentiful contemporary illustrations makes this book a stand out among the genre.him to comment on battlefield and camp experiences in all their gritty detail as well as those portions of the Union high command with whom he came in contact.

Clearer was that the force of arms of the Union would finally crush Southern field armies.  Less clear was whether or not that would be enough to end the rebellion.<br />Winik focus on the possibility that the leaders and soldiers of the Confederacy might have melted away to the hills and forrests of the South to wage a protracted guerilla war.  As Winik sees it, this was a very real option.  It was what Jefferson Davis wanted and had the potential of either perpetuating the conflict for years or tipping opinion in the North finally in favor of a settlement becuase of war weariness.<br />Of course guerilla warfare did not come about.  First Lee, then Johnston and other Confederate department commanders surrendered their soldiers en mass along lines that recognized them as honorable combatants and allowed them to go home with their dignity and lives.  Winik's book focuses on the choices faced by Robert E. Lee as he fled from Richmond and began his race with Grant to Appomattox Court House.<br />This is a different kind of  book.  It's not straight history.  The battles and military manuevers of the final month are sketched rather thinly.  This book falls more in the lines of a treatise or long essay.  Winik constantly expounds his thesis of the guerilla war option and it's possible results in this almost 500 page book.  The military situation and stories weave in an out of this narrative.  Mini-biographies of Grant, Lee, Lincoln, Jefferson and other principals also are included, usually right before something interesting is going to happen.<br />I was disappointed, and don't agree with the majority of reviewers that place this book on the top shelf of Civil War histories.  It is interesting in part, and I think the close of the war does deserve a book of this length.  I just think it could have been done better.<br />The guerilla war thesis is ok, but it dominates the book.  Winik may have been on to something, but his case rests upon assertions as much as fact.  It is not clear from the record that guerilla war was a realistic option in the minds of Confederate leadership.  Winik elevates the possibility to a higher level than I believe history warrents.<br />The pace of the book is often frustrating.  In reviewing the military situations faced by various armies, Winik usually describes the status of the forces then cuts to a long biography of the generals involved.  It breaks up the pace of the story and spends a lot of time on background that is extraneous.<br />I also find Winik's writing style a hit or miss.  He tries to emulate Shelby and Catton by describing this story in a narrative and literary voice.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it rings hollow and overdone.<br />I was dissappointed to discover that eminent historians such as James McPherson and Doris Kearns Goodwin apparently write cover blurbs with out reading the whole book.  Winik's work unfortunatly contains serious errors of fact that these two would have picked up on -- I can imagine they will be a little bit embarrassed when they do uncover some of the author's misses.  For example, the author seems to think there are two General Longstreets -- &quot;James&quot; and &quot;Pete&quot;.  In fact, Pete was Gen. James Longstreet's nickname.  Winik lists Salmon P. Chase as Secretary of the Treasury at this time, when in fact Lincoln had made him Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  Winik makes the statement that Generals Johnston and Sherman were never to meet again after the surrender -- in fact Johnston died as a result of attending Sherman's funeral and refusing to put his hat on during inclement weather out of respect.  He also muffed Stanton's great quote regarding Lincoln at the time of his death:  &quot;Now he belongs to the ages&quot; is mis-rendedred &quot;Now he belongs to the angels.&quot;<br />These errors are annoying and left me wondering what other facts might be suspect.<br />On the whole, this is an ok Civil War book.  The end of the war is a fascinating topic.  I personnally would have liked a more thorough military and political examination of the period.  Winik's thesis is interesting, but the book suffers from errors, disjointedness and sometimes overwrought prose.<br />These errors are annoying and left me wondering what other facts might be suspect.<br />On the whole, this is an ok Civil War book.

John Howard and D Company of Britain's &quot;Ox and Bucks&quot; regiment.  As the first Allied unit to land in France on D-Day, these glider borne men had the job of capturing two bridges that would help secure the flank of Operation Overlord.<br />Stephen Ambrose makes a good case that had these men failed, the German panzers may have had the opportunity to crush first the British 6th Airborne Division and then roll up the invasion beaches.  We'll never know, because these men did not fail.  Silently landing within yards of their target, they quickly secured the Caen Canal Bridge and an adjacent span fifty yards away over the Orne River.  Both had been wired for demolition and were guarded (although not by boys from the Fatherland but forced conscripts from occupied Eastern Europe the Germans had rounded up to fill their need for men).  Howard's men literally stole the bridges in a manner of minutes with minimal fighting.  They then established a perimiter to beat off any German counter-attack until they could be relieved by paratroopers who dropped shortly after D Company pulled off their coup de main.  While waiting for relief, they faced a tank counter-attack.  Holding only one Piat, a hand held anti-tank weapon that was not held in high regard by the troops, a sergeant nailed the lead tank at a distance of forty yards.  This persuaded the rest of the German column to retreat and wait -- thinking that Howard's men possessed larger anti-tank weapons.  Thus less than two hundred glider borne air troopers were able to attack, take and hold two critical bridges -- and right under the nose of a nearby enemy tank regiment.<br />This is a delightful book that moves along at Ambrose's usual fast pace.  He fills it with first hand accounts from British, German and French participants -- luckily many of the principals were alive when he wrote the book which gives it an unparralled directness and detail.  Ambrose goes into the personalities of the principals and discusses the training and planning that went into making D Company a premeir fighting outfit.  Capt. Howard deserves much of the credit for sharpening his unit into what must have been one of the most effective small units in the war. Over a period of almost two years, he put them through his own designed training regimen that earned for them the mission.<br />This is a short book at less than two hundred pages (and oddly shaped -- I've never read a book as tall and skinny and am curious as to why it was published in these dimensions).  Perfect if one has the hours to dive into and finish a good war story in one sitting.als and discusses the training and planning that went into making D Company a premeir fighting outfit.  Capt.

I've read the last &quot;A Stillness at Appomattox,&quot; his Pulitzer-Prize winning final installment to the series.  Like &quot;Stillness,&quot; &quot;Glory Road&quot; is a masterpiece of history and writing.<br />Catton has the rare ability, similar to Shelby Foote and Barbara Tuchman, to write well researched history as prose.  While thoroughly covering the trials of the Army of the Potomac in its middle period (post McClellan, pre-Grant), he paints an excellent human picture of those who guided and fought the  battles.  Liberal use of diary and contemporary accounts from field officers and privates portrays a gritty depiction of army life and battle conditions.  He also is very adept at finding the color that bring characters such as Burnside, Hooker, Meade and a host of others to life.<br />The history is plentiful and solid.  The stories of this transitional period for the Army of the Potomic are well told.  Fredricksburg, a folly of planning and execution, tested the mettle of the army.  Chancellorsville revealed its ability to act decisively (although the inability of Hooker to keep going set it up for spectacular defeat) as a well organized offensive war machine. Gettysburg gave it what it craved for two years -- an important victory over the Confederate forces.<br />The battles are well explained from both a strategic point as well as in execution.  The evolving organization and professionalization of the army is well told.  In this period (and primarily as a result of Hooker's reforms), cavalry was made an effective service, logistics were brought up to snuff, moral was given its proper weight in the care of the army.  Many of these non-battlefield stories had great impact on the eventual success of this army and Catton does them justice.<br />Bruce Catton has here an excellent history that is also a wonderfully told story.  Both the casual and involved Civil War fan will find much to enjoy in &quot;The Glory Road.&quot;in &quot;The Glory Road.&quot;	2001-05-24

As a bonus, I liked this story.<br />The simple premise revolves around a nine year old lost in a huge woods with only her wits and a few supplies to sustain her.  Her wits devolve upon Red Sox pitcher Tom Gordon, her favorite player, whose image accompanies her.  The imagined Gordon provides the inner voice she needs to meet the challenges of the deep woods and her own mind.  Of course, there also lurks the unknown terror at the edge of the wood, but from King's reputation I assume that this nemesis provides much less horror than is usually found in his more famous works.  Rather, the unknown terror provides suspense and a motivating force that this child must deal with.  More would give away the crux of the story.  Suffice to say the reader won't be disappointed by the end of the book.<br />Simple, but King's excellent writing sustains this simple premise over two hundred and fifty odd pages.  His character development is wonderful -- one feels the little girl's (Trisha)emotions as she confronts her trials.  His dialogue (in flashbacks) feels real and the whole story is believable.<br />This book works and is an excellent quick read.	2001-05-17

Anyone familiar with his magazine articles in American Heritage knows he is adept at holding readers' attention over several thousand words.<br />This book reads like a collection of magazine articles.  The chapters focus on different personalities or events that shaped (or epitomized) Wall Street over the last two centuries.  While there are some attempts to link subjects to their past (notably in the development of rules and regulations), the book reads more like a collection from various time periods rather than a synthesized whole.<br />What the reader gets are interesting snapshots.  And Gordon does make them interesting.  Always an engaging writer, he mixes the right amount of fact and commentary to keep a credible story moving along at a nice pace.  The author does justice to many fascinating personalities (Hamilton, Fisk, Gould, Vanderbilt, Morgan, Greene, Kennedy, Milkin and Boesky), and events (panics, depression, corners, theft, corruption, manipulation) that have shaped the American financial system since the dawn of our Republic.  The chapters are just long enough to gain an appreciation for the subject at hand, but not too long as to bore.<br />This book is not a study or treatise on financial products or their development.  These are mentioned in passing so as to give familiarity to the reader.  But, do not expect to learn about how stocks, derivatives or mutual funds (etc., etc.) work in detail here.<br />While this is not an in depth study of the Street, it is an excellent and engaging survey that will interest the general reader.	2001-05-15

Indeed, that document was a plan on paper that could arguably have been observed more in the breech had Washington had anything like Napolean's thirst for personal power.<br />Yet that marvelous document was strengthened by Washington's desire to observe its structure and strictures.  Smith details how our first president was keenly aware that his organization of the government and almost every action were setting the precedents that would determine whether his successors would be preside in his spirit or in a vein more threatening to the liberties he had helped purchase during the Revolution.<br />He also had the help of very intelligent men in his cabinet -- principally Hamilton and Jefferson -- who had opposing views as to the nature of the federal government and its goals and desired relationship to the individual, states and the economy.  That Washington was able to keep them both in his employ during the critical period of his first term reveals him to be a very good politician who was adept at balancing interests, using his prestige, and satisfying the egos of men who thought they were destined to design the nation in this first presidency.<br />I would have liked a little more detail on the actual organization of the government and it's establishment.  Smith focuses more on the personal and relationships of Washington and his key subordinates -- somewhat of a style over substance analysis of his two terms.  Yet at this period, style and nuance were critical to setting a positive tone for the presidency and Smith's focus is certainly a good lense through which to shed more light on this important historical era.	2001-05-08

He appears, Zelig-like, at the head of armies, at the elbow of both the Kings of France and England and in the great councils of state that determined the actions of a nascent French nation.<br />His story is remarkable and remarkably well documented.  His life and actions serve as the central thread that ties the events surrounding the Hundred Year's War between England and France together in this marvelous book.<br />Tuchman displays this late Middle Age period in all of its nasty burtality.  The Great Plague hit in several waves, reducing Europe's population by between one half and one third.  A century of warfare left roving bands of knights and armed men loose in the countryside to pillage and destroy between summons to fight for king and country.  The common man and woman, evolving from a status of near slavery to severe oppression, owed service to their lord and taxes to almost everyone.<br />Tuchman brilliantly weaves the above facts of life with the politics and struggles between rival nobles, kingdoms and a corrupt church.  This book is very well written, as I had always heard Tuchman's works to be.  She possesses the rare ability to write solid history -- this book is fact filled, and thoroughly documented -- in the manner of a great storyteller.  Her characters and events, leavened by Tuchman's wry observations and logical conclusioins, are marvelously developed.<br />So much happened in this time period that it does bear scrutiny.  Chivalry, the code of the Knight that was suppossed to benefit people in exchange for a life free from common worries, had denegrated into a corrupt facade that shielded ruthless brigands from law and sanction.  The great Church, long the common denominator among disparate peoples became first hopelessly corrupt then divided for decades by rival popes more interested in Europe's balance of power among earthly kingdoms than in promoting the Kingdom to whom they suppossedly gave vasselage.  Great landed nobility struggled with each other and began a transformation from nearly autonomous players in an ever changing system of alliances across nationalities to becomming the building blocks of the infant state.  Policy and war rose and fell on the ability, whim and maturity of changing kings.<br />Although our own recently passed Twentieth Century could witness evil and bloodletting on a more sustained and organized basis than any that preceeded it -- hence the title &quot;Through a Distant Mirror,&quot; Tuchman's work also illustrates how far society has come in those parts of the world where it is civil and grounded in natural rights.  Thus, Tuchman's book shows both the constant danger through time of man's darker side as well as the progress earned by those who have managed to diffuse power and ground everyday people with a voice in their affairs and rights that can not be abrogated.<br />This is a marvelous work from every facet.  I am now ordering other Tuchman books to see how she handles man's affairs in centuries distant from that enjoyed by Enguerrand de Coucy.rival popes more interested in Europe's balance of power among earthly kingdoms than in promoting the Kingdom to whom they suppossedly gave vasselage.

By the end of 1945 it was a city and the central focus of a government that managed the sixteen million men and women in uniform who fought the Second World War and the other millions who supported the effort at home.<br />This required office space, housing, entertainment and above all people, people, people.  More people than anyone imagined could be supported in our ten mile square federal district.<br />David Brinkley saw the transformation first hand.  People and buildings could literally not be deployed fast enough in our nation's capitol city to keep up with the demands of World War. The effort to accomodate this change is an interesting story told well by the author. The pace and magnitude of change is fascinating to behold.  One wonders how the bureaucracy that took a 250,000 man fighting force from wooden training rifles to the millions who had 50,000 aircraft alone to deploy against our enemies were able to undertake this phenominal expansion in reasonably good order.  As Brinkley tells it, it was part good old American &quot;can-do&quot; attitude coupled with a near unanimous belief in our mission and dedication to winning the war.<br />Somehow the City, and the people responsible for running its only true industry (government) managed the task and its transformation fairly well.<br />Brinkley is a good story teller, and his chronicle of how Washington changed during the war years is also the story of America coming of age.  He brings a fresh descriptive narrative to what turns out to be a pretty interesting story.	2001-04-18

Growing up with the new medium of television, he and his partner (Chet Huntly) wrote much of the playbook for the way network news and tv interview shows are conducted.<br />This is an interesting story that tells not only of Brinkley's growth and development but also of the maturation of the tv news industry.  Along the way, Brinkley was witness to many seminal events and has of course met many of the notables of his era.<br />The man's integrity and dedication to the profession of journalism shines through in this book.  I can't imagine Sam or Cokie or Dan or Peter writing this book.  Too much would be devoted to image and the their impact on the news.  Brinkley was able to achieve the incredible credibility he enjoyed because he was made of different stuff -- this is the story of a darn good journalist who understood the difference between covering the news and entering it.	2001-04-18

It touches the same cords with the same force that To Kill a Mockingbird did several decades ago.<br />Jake Brigance is Grisham's young Southern lawyer and the protagonist who faces long odds in doing right. Carl Lee Hailey -- a black resident of Clanton, Mississippi - has a young daughter who is viciously raped by local rednecks. Hailey takes a father's revenge on the rapists during their trial, killing them in one of the most sympathetic acts of vigilantism ever written.  The incident splits the community along Mississippi's traditioinal black/white fault lines as the book asks: Is Hailey justified in this killing or is he a murderer?  Brigance must represent Hailey and thread his way through a cauldron that pits the remnants of the Klan against a confident and energized black population amidst a community that thought these scenes had receeded into history.<br />This is Girsham's best work.  The story and characters are extremely well developed, the writing fast paced and the story goes beyond adventure in probing a moral dilemma I suspect breaks about 50/50 among people who read it.  Being a father, it is easy to sympathize with Hailey -- indeed I rooted for him the entire span of the book.  You will too.  This is a book you'll remember twenty years from now and be glad you read.	2001-04-09

Ususlly, political registration was a sure indicator for election outcomes and the blessing of the local party a prerequisite for a shot at political office.  Not anymore.  Reforms and changes in the 1970s eviscerated political parties as dominant actors in the process.  They are still a force to be reckoned with, but in many locals less important than personal political organizations that have sprung up around candidate focused electoral machines.<br />Bibby looks at this transformation as a chronicler and explains the changes as well as current practices.  A student of political parties and their role will find this book useful.<br />I'm teaching a course in elective politics at the University of Pennsylvania's Fels Center of Government.

The author also provides useful examples of forms and other organizational tools your campaign will want to utilize to organize itself and campaign data.<br />The style is breezy and matter of fact.  Grey uses some of his personal experiences to illustrate his points.  This is helpful, since it increases the credibility of the points he's making.

Over one million became casualties there over a period of ten months -- all in an area one could easily stoll through in an afternoon.<br />Horne tells the story not only from the vantage point of the grand strategists (although calling those who fought the battle strategists is a stretch), but also through the words of soldiers on both sides who wallowed in the mud and death of a patch of France for the better part of a year.<br />This story is well told.  It serves not only as a first class history of one of the world's most ferocious battles, but also as a testament to the banality and waste of war.  Highly recommended	2001-03-18

Most of the tablets reside at Antietam, Maryland, but others are found at South Mountain, Harper's Ferry and a few other locations.<br />The book serves its purpose well.  Anyone interested in a presentation of the locations of the troops involved will find this a handy guide.  Messers. Swisher and Large have performed a good service for the historian and serious student of the Campaign.<br />For the general reader, the synopses of each phase of the campaign will appear too short to give a good impression of what was happening or the significance of various unit locations.  I also found the maps a little too loosely drawn and smallish to be of as much help as one may have hoped for.<br />Nonetheless, this book hits the target at which it aims -- a catalogue of location markers for units involved in the campaign that led to America's single bloodiest day of combat -- September 17, 1862	2001-03-18

Most do not know where they all are or present them in any coherent form.  This book remedies that situation for the state of Maryland.  The book will serve as a snapshot of Maryland's rich history through a geogrpahically based capsule of what happened in each county.  It also serves as a wonderful tour guide for any inclined to undertake history and event based touring.<br />The book is richly illustrated with first class photographs. (One of the annual lighting of Anteitam Battlefield is brilliant -- I called to get information for a visit). The synopses of each marker and event give a good sketch of what happened where.<br />By the way, the same authors have been commissioned to do a photographic history of Delaware throught its historic markers (due out in the Fall of 2001).  Anyone interested in a small state that packs a lot of history will enjoy that work.	2001-03-18

I found his explanation of the mechanics and physiology of lethal injection particularly gripping.  His characters,  a young lawyer without any family but with lots of questions about them, and his aunt who has smothered her childhood memories with a blanket of booze are well drawn and move the story along nicely.<br />I won't give away the plot lines.  Suffice it to say that this is one of Grisham's finest efforts (along with The Firm, The Testament, and A Time To Kill).  A quick read and solid story that does make you think.	2001-03-17

I was surprised that the characters never paused to catch their breath -- they are on the run for thrity some odd hours and amazingly have enough stamina to make it through a Michael Crichton novel without keeling over from exhaustion.<br />Timeline entertains if not quite enthralls.  Although the author's character's are weakly drawn, they are easy to distinguish and are always doing something.  The science is interesting -- as it is in all of his efforts.  Crichton makes time travel (really travel between parrallel universes) interesting and even believable.<br />The story is the tale of scientists and adventurers who travel back to the 1300's and get stuck in the middle of a battle of the Hundred Year's War.  The site happens to be the one the team is excavating at the turn of the 21st century.  Needless to say they face the usual perils one would expect of the Middle Ages as they struggle to gather themselves and catch the window back to the present.  An evil corporation that controls the technology and wants to make Disneyland look like a broken down church carnival by offering time travel as the &quot;new&quot; entertainment provides the moral delimma one expects in Chrichton's works.<br />This book will entertain you --- the writing is crisp, the science well researched and plausible, the history pretty good.

The character and the story line are historic fact which provides an interesting platform for this tale.<br />Fadlan, from the cultured City of Baghad, is repelled and aghast at the practices of the Vikings he encounters in South Eastern Europe.  A moralist with a strict code of appropriate behavior, he must do as ambassadors have frequently been called to do -- interact with a Viking host whose everyday behavior violates his code and moral standards.<br />Despite their different cultures (or the Vikings lack of culture as opposed to Fadlan's relatively well-developed one), Fadlan is taken to by his hosts and joins them when they are summoned back to Scandinavia to rescue their beseiged clan.  The tale includes mythic enemies and battles worthy of this medieval travelogue.  Fadlan and his hosts are tested according to the savage tenor of the times as they grapple with enemies unchecked in their ferocious desire to persevere over the Norsemen.<br />The book is a great tale and fascinating account of the times.

What makes it fascinating is that Chrichton has woven a current issue -- on the job sexual harrassment -- into the heart of the story.<br />But its not sexual harrassment the way you'd expect.  Tom Sanders  -- Digicom's Vice President -- is harrassed by his new boss Meridth Johnson after she wins a promotion fight they both were waging.  The old story of a boss using position for sexual gratification is turned on its head -- she is in the power position, demanding performance from the man and creating an environment of retaliation at his refusal.<br />The book is a wonderful expose of sexual harrassment by examining it from an unconventional vantage point.  This serious issue does at first look different when a man is the accuser against a female.  But this refreshing portrayal produces a first rate look at the problem.<br />The rest of the story surrounds high tech corporate culture, market pressure, a fascinating look at virtual reality technology and the tried and true secrative corporate machinations that reveal themselves over the course of the book.<br />I must add that the issue does not detract from the story.  It greatly enhances Chrichton's work proving once again that he is a master story teller and a genius at weaving disparate elements into a first rate thriller.	2001-03-12

Combining both of these skills often seems difficult in some popular histories, but when it works it produces a highly readable and insightful understanding of the past.<br />Klien tells the story of the Union's slide into the abyss of Civil War - with most of the focus on the period between Lincoln's election and the firing on Ft. Sumter.  Using many first-person accounts, he gives an immediacy and presence to this tale that helps the reader feel he is there as the great decisions, positions and vaccilations are taken during this critical period.<br />Days of Defiance reminds the reader that the Civil War was perhaps an irrepressable conflict.  Despite attempts to conciliate and compromise, the Republicans in the North would not brook the extension of slavery.  The South saw the North's hostitity to the spread of the institution and the loss of it's hold on the national government as threatening to the slave based economy in the states where it was legal.  Although many tried to find a middle path, the sectional interests were too diametricly opposed to ward off war.<br />The focus of the book are the events during the twilight of the Buchanan Administration, the struggle in Congress to do something that could produce a compromise and the efforts of South Carolina to dissolve the Union.  The Buchanan Administration, reflecting the political base and culture of the President, was amazing in its inability to produce a policy that would at least address the growing crisis.  The president elect, waiting for four months to assume office after his election, had to balance the act of satisfying factions of the Republican Party in putting together the first Republican Administration with the need to adopt a posture that did not accelerate a crisis brought to its head by his election.  In trying not to accelerate the crisis before he could claim the reins of the government, he also had to maintain his positions regarding the spread of slavery and unlawfulness of secession -- positions that had garnered him his victory and the support of the North.<br />The portraits of the president and the president-elect and their minions are fascinating.  Lincoln's genious for leadership shows through some early trials and mistakes as he assumes his first administrative office.  Buchanan's lack of support, reliance on friends who did not have the Administration's best interests at heart and personal unwillingness to adopt any policy helped create a vacuum that South Carolinian seccessionists gladly filled.  Buchanan's secretaries -- particularly Floyd of the War department-- exhibited loyalty to their factions that in some cases could best be described as treasonous.  Lincoln needed to pull men into his cabinet who in three or four cases thought themselves superior to the president-elect and saw themselves as &quot;managing&quot; the new leader, while setting the tone and discipline necessary  to ensure that the Lincoln Administration would be run by Lincoln and not Chase or Seward or Cameron.<br />At the middle of this story stands Maj. Anderson and the garrison at Ft. Sumter.  It's presence in rebellious So. Carolina's Charleston Harbor was the focal point to this irrespresible conflict.  Although frequently cut off from the decision makers in both the Buchanan and Lincoln Administrations, the decisions made by Maj. Anderson forced the chain of events that led to the bombardment of the fort and the start of our Civil War.<br />This is a fascinating story well told by Klein.regarding the spread of slavery and unlawfulness of secession -- positions that had garnered him his victory and the support of the North.<br />The portraits of the president and the president-elect and their minions are fascinating.

Seville, who served in the regiment, this book presents a first person account of the 1st Regiment Delaware Volunteers as they participated in some of the great battles in the East such as Fredricksburg, Anteitam, Gettysburg and others. The book relies heavily on regimantal after battle reports, some of which are printed in their entirety.<br />The prose is sparse and the story is sparingly told.  Nevertheless, this account of the service of one of the best regiments of the Civil War (which suffered tremendous casualties opposite the Bloody Lane at Anteitam and helped repel Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg) is fascinating.	2001-03-08

Unfold an interesting tale of criminality or nefarious doings that moves at a quick pace and never gets boring.  Yes, it is not his best book, as many others point out, but still ranks as a good effort from one of the most popular authors in America today.<br />This story hinges on a wonderfully simple criminal extortion scheme hatched by three judges doing time in a federal penitentiary.  Their scheme (I don't want to give it away) plays upon people exercising a fantasy in a way they think is discrete, only to find themselves subject to paying to keep their identity and fetish secret from their families, friends and community.  The difficult task for the schemers is doing this from inside the pen, but they overcome that problem with the help of a few well placed twenties and a corrupt local attorney.<br />This story manages to intertwine the swindle with presidential politics, CIA intrigues and a counter-plan to silence the Brethern (as the judges refer to themselves) before they interfere with a chillingly brazen plan to capture the White House.<br />I didn't think Grisham spent as much time developing most of his characters as he has in past books -- many make convenient appearances in order to advance the plot and then disappear again.  But the pacing is quick, the story intriguing and clever, and all in all a fun read.	2001-02-28

The narrative voice reminds one more of a long magazine piece rather than traditional non-fiction, but this pacing helps make Isaac's Storm a quick read.<br />The Galveston storm was a tremendous tragedy.  At least six thousand people died in one of North America's most violent hurricains on record.  Yet the timing of the storm (1900) also caught America at a self-confident moment that exposed the cost of hubris.  We thought knew weather better than we did, thought we could tame nature, and thought that coastal development was immune to the ravages experienced by such places in other parts of the world.  This storm provided a wonderful illustration of what happens when luck and happenstance are taken for understanding and certainty.<br />Interesting tidbits abound in the story.  The author does a good job of explaining the formation of cyclones and hurricanes and makes it interesting.  The formation of the national weather bureau (and the petty jealousies that attended it in these years) is likewise iintersting and tells the story of why Galveston literally had no warning that it was in harm's way (the author leaves you with the impression that some warning could have been avaialable if not for human stupidity and bureaucratic turf consciousness).  By far, however, the strongest voices in the story are those who witnessed a natural calamity that literally scraped the site of a city from the earth.  The author provides very good descriptions (from eyewitnesses)of the hurricane itself and it's aftermath.<br />The only fault with the book is that the author does put a lot of words and thoughts in character's heads.  He admits this in his notes and I think gives a good defense of his methods -- and also has researched his story well enough that these licenses are strongly plausible.  This may bother pure historians, but it helps make a good story.<br />A very good read you may want to tackle in one sitting.  It did make me wonder why anyone would want to live in Galveston today -- sea wall or not!plausible.

War	As a writer, Fred Anderson is accessible and well researched.  Sometimes history writing makes these two traits seem mutually exclusive, but not in his wonderful study of British and Colonial relations amidst the Seven Years War.<br />Anderson's main thesis is that the Seven Year's War (known more popularly as the French and Indian War) did not need to lead to the American Revolution, but was a significant and major turning point in its own right.  The latter is fair enough, but I'm not sure that Anderson, despite his claims, is breaking really new ground with regard to not necessarily seeing the French and Indian War and our Revolution as a seemless progression to American Independence.  His analysis at the end of the book as to why this was not necessarily so is pretty thin, although the coverage of the events themselves certainly let the reader understand that there were several possible break points where Parlimentary action or policy changes could have kept America as part of the British Empire at least past 1776.<br />What Anderson has done is written a thorough history of the conflict.  He takes a wholistic approach and in fact focuses on war management and policy in more detail than the military campaigns.  They do not necessarily get short shrift, but they are not evaluated in the kind of minute detail that military histories provide.  This is appropriate.  As Anderson shows, the conflict was as much driven by the chess game played in European capitals and between Parliment and the Colonial assemblies as it was by battlefield developments.  The book reminded me of Middlekauf's &quot;Glorious Revolution,&quot; a series in the Oxford history of the United States that gave great background and discussion to causes and English debate over our Revolution in additon to telling the story as written by our troops.<br />Anderson shows how the character of the relationship between England and the Colonies was much different while the French held Canada. France brillintly used its indian allies in ways the English never considered, treating them as co-equals and using them to harass the American frontier in order to protect their penetration into the Ohio Valley and Illinois country.  While this menace existed, the colonists were united in desperately wanting British troop protection.  The British-Franco rivalry, always upon a tinderbox during this time in Europe, only needed an incident to ignite it anew into war.  That the incident was provided by troops under George Washington's command in Pennsylvania is a delicious irony of history.<br />The reslutling war was a struggle between French and English troops, between various Indian tribes allied to or caught in the middle of the combatants and between Parliment and the Colonial assemblies regarding funding and local support for the war.  As history would show, the debates and various strategies employed by Parliment to secure colonial financial and manpower contributions to the effort would set the stage for the Stamp Act, Quatering Act and other post war Parlimentary initiated crises that paved the way for American Independence.<br />Along the way we meet wonderful characters.  An early George Washington in search of glory and wealth via militia command.  The indominable William Pitt, parlimentarian master and stragegic visionary whose management of the war effort led to a stunning military victory and close colonial cooperation with the mother country.  Lord Grenville, who followed Pitt and in a short time reversed the policies that had brought the colonies close to Parliment and accepting of Pitt's imperial order.  George III who in a pique of personality sacked Pitt for no other reason than to placate opposition forces that had gathered around him while he was waiting for a vacancy on the throne.<br />All in all, its a big story that is well written, lucid and engaging.  For a big book, it has short paragraphs, which help keep the pace moving along nicely.  For anyone interested in the French and Indian War and the evolving nature of American identity as well as the path toward Revolution, this is a good choice.ested in the French and Indian War and the evolving nature of American identity as well as the path toward Revolution, this is a good choice.	2001-02-21

Longstreet sparks strong assessments among Civil War enthusiasts.  Wert explains why.<br />This biography tells the story of the rise and military career of the general Lee referred to as &quot;my old warhorse.&quot;  A superb fighter - perhaps the most tenacious of Lee's Corps commanders, Longstreet had a preference for the defense, or at least a defensive posture awaiting an opportunity to counter-punch.  His one independent fighting command, against Burnside in East Tennessee, revealed that the General was best suited to Corps command under a Lee or other officer of strategic vision.<br />Yet Longstreet served his cause well.  Unwilling to join in the deification of Lee after the war (and even criticizing him on some matters), Longstreet also became a Republican and accepted an appointment from his old pre-war friend (now president) U.S. Grant.  These moves caused a significant anti-Longstreet backlash across the South -- which taints his reputation even to this day.<br />I must say that Wert does a good job of exploring the controversary over his reputation and examining the highlights of his career. The information in the book is significant, if less than thorough and somewhat unevenly presented.  I also found the voice of the author too present in the reading -- something in the way the book is written doesn't allow it to reach it's own voice or a consistently even flow.  I would give this four stars for the subject and facts and three stars for the quality of the writing.<br />All in all, not bad and worthwhile if someone wants to acquaint themselves with Longstreet.	2001-02-06

Also described thoroughly is Lincoln's Louisianna reconstruction plan, which gives a pretty plausible map to what reconstruction could have looked like had Booth not intervened.<br />I found the writing average.

As anyone who has read his delightful three volume history of the Civil War can attest, his novelist background combined with thorough research to produce a classic of American literature and history.<br />This book is an excerpt from the history focusing on the Vicksburg campaign. As one of the most significant campaigns (some argue the most significant) of our national four year drama (and tragedy), this breakout survives its separation from the whole very well.<br />Foote traces the story thoroughly.  Vicksburg controlled the Mississippi and was the strong point that thwarted the Union's efforts to cut the Confederacy from Arkansas and Texas.  It was a very strong site, with bluffs that commanded the river and thousands of troops.  U.S. Grant tried traditional ways to approach the city.  His failures led him to perhaps the riskiest, most bold and audacious campaign of the war.  Grant here is revealed as the master strategist, commander and decision maker. The story of the first major army to &quot;live off the land&quot; and his swing through Mississippi and the investiture of Vicksburg from the South and East is dramatic and stirring -- and extremely well handled in the more than competent hands of Shelby Foote.	2001-01-31

This book is a collection of his essays and lectures on various Civil War topics.  As such, it lacks the central theme of a book.  It does, however, allow one of America's most learned CW historians to range over vairous topics and explore them with his insightful thinking and clear, bold prose.<br />The topics are varied, from a look at the origns of the war, why it turned out the way it did, the continuing impact of the war on American society (with a nice discussion of the movie &quot;Glory&quot;) as well as a collection of essays on the Enduring Lincoln.  A nice endpiece looks at problems with current day historical scholarship and historians and is a good argument for getting that important field of study back on track and away from the political agenda that has unfortunately subverted the purpose of many historians.<br />This is a good book for the reader who knows something of the war and enjoys an intellectual treatment of various war topics that go beyond storytelling.

It could be argued the Grey men appeared to fight for the right to own slaves most of them had no hope of ever owning themselves while the men in blue fought to stop the spread of an institution which enslaved a race most of them thought not deserving of legal, social or economic equality with themselves.<br />In McPhereson's brilliantly researched book, he paints the Civil War soldier on both sides as a complex individual whose motives for engaging in Civil War were at times noble, idealistic or principled.  The author reviewed more than a thousand letters soldiers wrote during the war to recreate the state of mind and motivations of the combatants.<br />The results will paint a much more nuanced picture for the reader than they probably had on the subject before.  This is important work that does as good a job as I can imagine of recreating the mindsets of individuals long dead but who largely defined the course of American history through our present time.  This book is a relatively quick read and written in McPhereson's excellent style -- authoritative while emminently engaging.	2001-01-30

It's the kind of easy-to-pick-up-and-browse book that will entertain and inform on a moment's notice.  It's accessibility is a positive -- its the kind of book that children can pick up and browse, take in a few vignettes and become attracted to the Revolution at their own pace without the intimidation provided by a more typical history.<br />This is a well illustrated book making good use of period paintings and maps.  The side vignettes on break out topics often provide fascinating highlights to the main story.  The writing is good, although the amount of information provided classifies this book as an overview.  The serious student may want the book for the illustrations, but the words cover the broad sweep of the war at a level they will already be familiar with.  These factors make it an excellent introduction to the topic.	2001-01-30

This is a fine one volume treatment of the Civil War done in a most accessible fashion.  The words provide a good overview and summary of the subject.  What brings it alive are the many pictures, maps, focus subjects and commentaries in this coffee table book.  The media and elements come together to fascinate and captivate the reader.  This book is a companion to Burn's monumental ten part PBS television series by the same title.  The book captures it's style well, and even uses some of the most memorable documents -- like the romantic and haunting Sullivan Ballou (sp?) letter written prior to the first Bull Run that foretold the passing of its author and a simpler America.<br />Althought the material is strictly introductory, even the serious Civil War student will find fascination at haveing a story they know so well, so well illustrated and illuminated.<br />Introduce your children to this book and watch them become interested in our country's greatest story.	2001-01-29

He focuses on graduates of West Point's Class of 1846.  Those school boys would face the normal rigors and competition of a quality institution unaware that glory, ignominy, death and mortal competition with their class mates would be their fate.<br />That class produced a score of Civil War generals, among them McClellan, Jackson, Stoneman, A.P. Hill and Pickett.  This book is fascinating in tracing their backgrounds, school experiences, Mexican-American War service and subsequent Civil War triumphs and tragedies.  Of particular interest in Thomas (Stonewall) Jackson's story -- the odd general was also an odd young man who followed his own inner light.<br />Interesting, perceptive and covers background information not usually found in even the most thorough histories of the war's battles.	2001-01-29

What was unique about this book was its appearence during his presidential campaigns.  It stood out and well against the more typical rush biographies or issues books many who run for the presidency squeeze off the presses and hand out to anyone who will take them in Iowa, New Hampshire and Delaware.<br />The size of Alexander's booklet increases the chance that aspiring pols will actually read it.  Although it is self serving (as any campaign bio is), it is a quick read and interesting in some places.  I've met Alexander and he is a much more complex and astute politician than these simple sayings might indicate, but it does capture his down home, honest, straight shooter approach to politics. (and Lamar, if you ever read this, we do appreciate the copy you autographed and sent along for our new born son).	2001-01-29

Sears has done a marvelous job with the telling of this campaign's story.<br />Lee was looking to carry the war north at the start of the campaign.  One of the great accidents of history caused him to scrape his plans and fight a defensive battle on the banks of Antietan Creek -- his orders of march were lost by one of his commanders and found by a couple of Union sergeants attracted to the cigars which were tied around them.<br />The result was a battle in which George McClellan missed the opportunity to live up to the messianic destiny which he forsaw for himself.  With a two to one advantage against an enemy who was scrambling to assemble all of his forces in a desperate attempt to survive, the ever cautious McClellan proved yet again that great organizers don't necessarily make great or even adequate field commanders.<br />Sears uses first person accounts to illustrate the story.  It is well balanced between the general's view and those of the men shouldering the muskets.  As usual, Sears's writing is superb.  Particularly engrossing is his depiction of the race by A.P. Hill to arrive in time to stave off the separation of the Confederates from their river crossings by Bursides' late afternoon attack.  Its one of those moments in history when troops arrive over the hill unexpectedly and just in time to reverse the course of battle -- and probably ensure that the Civil War would continue for three more bloody years.  An excellent book.	2001-01-26

The Battle of Chancellorsville was arguably the most complex battle of the Civil War -- featuring wide flanking movements by both the Union and Confederate forces, moments of &quot;truth&quot; for both sides (Jackson's movement and hit on Hooker's left flank; Hooker's hesitation in front of Catherine Furnace), memorable charactors and high drama -- including the wounding of Jackson.<br />Using many first person accounts and very good research, Sears puts it all into an incredible story.  Of note is his favorable treatment of Hooker -- somewhat revisionist but very well documented and argued.  I imagine most readers will come away convinced that Hooker was somewhat ill treated by Lincoln and history for his handling of the battle.<br />All in all a great Civil War read.	2001-01-26

As anyone who has read his delightful three volume history of the Civil War can attest, his novelist background combined with thorough research to produce a classic of American literature and history.<br />This book is an excerpt from the history focusing on the Gettysburg campaign.  As perhaps the most dramatic episode of our national four year drama (and tragedy), this breakout survives its separation from the whole very well.<br />Foote traces the reasons Davis allowed Lee to march north and the ensuing battle thoroughly.  Although not given the breadth of Coddington's description in his classic &quot;Gettysburg:  A Study in Command,&quot; Foote does his job extremely well over 290 (small sized) pages.  This is a factual yet at the same time romantic telling of the great battle of American history.	2001-01-26

His detailed studies of aspects and campaigns of the war set the standard for CW writing for many who take more than a casual interest in the subject.  This book displays his easy writing that mixes interesting facts with a style that never bores or bogs down in academic prose.<br />For the student or curious who want the broad sweep of the war explained in a couple of hundred pages this book is excellent.  Its all here:  the orignis, major campaigns in the East and West and the politics that often defined the conflict.  Strictly an overview, it is not for the serious CW reader, but would serve as an excellent starting point for someone looking to begin an affiliation with America's most significant conflict.	2001-01-20

Using photos collected from citizens of Delaware's foremost unincorporated community, the authors have preserved the look and feel of the &quot;town&quot; as it existed in the early to mid 20th Century.

Irving is very good at description and Ichabod Crane, his future (hopefully) father in law, his intended and his competitor for the young lady's attentions are all well sketched.<br />This book is very floridly written.  Long paragraphs are given over to minute descriptions that just don't appear in today's fiction.  To those nurtured on 20th Century prose, the contrast makes Irving's stories seem turgid and very slow moving.  You can recognize Irving's talent with words and long sentences in the writing -- unfortunately those very talents interfere with the pace and presentation of the underlying story.	2001-01-08

This is a big story that never fails to enthral and entertain.  I stayed up many a night ripping off good sized chunks from a book I did not want to put down.  At almost a thousand pages, there are a lot of chunks.<br />Follett uses the thirty year building of a cathedral in 12th Century England to spin a ripping yarn.  This is a historical novel that uses the format to both teach about the times and tell a gripping tale of the lives of a score of characters involved either directly or peripherally with the construction.<br />Its all here.  Love. War. Torture. Rape.  Lust.  Greed.  Told against the backdrop of an English Civil War and the more immediate struggle between a priory (monestary) and a local earl.  The real life Kings Steven, Henry I and  Henry II and Thomas Beckett provide the historical backdrop as does the era.  If Follett has done his research thoroughlly, then the misery and challenge of medival life is well portrayed (except very few people die of disease and no children or their siblings succumb before adulthood -- an improbable situation given the times).<br />Besides being captivated by a very good story with many facets, you'll learn a bit about the majesty and technique involved in cathedral building, the economics, industry and agricultural practices attendant to survival, medival politics and the struggle within the church and between church and sovereign.<br />The characters are well drawn and varied.  Follett populates his story with strong women, and although unlikely given the practices and predjudices of the times, these women help form the focal point of the story and are easy to root for (except for sometime-Earl William Hamleigh's mother -- a cunning villan).  The men are more evenly split between good, evil and in between.  These characters are not one dimensional and most of the major figures have weaknesses that challenge them and make them very human in this book.<br />A great read you'll not want to let go.	2001-01-04

He is supposed to work one day and then leave his troubles behind him.  Wouldn't you know it, that one day gets him embroiled in a murder mystery unusual to  sleepy Wilmington, Delaware (this was written pre-Capano) when all he really wants is to forget his past troubles and embrace the quiet life.<br />This was a fun book, well written and entertaining.

Coleman) who audaciously bought control of the company from their uncles at the turn of the Twentieth Century.  A.I. ran the operations that made DuPont gunpowder the powder of choice for the country.  T.C. ran the executive offices while Pierre was the financial brains of the operation.  Together they took a reasonably prosperous family gunpowder company and built it into one of the behemoths of industrial America.  They were a resounding success.<br />This book provides and interesting portrait of the entreprenurial spark it took to make that transformation.  A.I. and his cousins were outstanding businessmen.  Wall also writes of A.I.'s difficult relationship with his family and Wilmington society (often one and the same), his scandelous marriage, the construction of his fortress home (with a broken glass topped wall that legend holds A.I. had constructed to keep his family out) that is now the DuPont Children's Hospital.<br />I found the book less interesting when it followed A.I. out of the DuPont company to Florida where he established wealth anew, including the St. Jones Paper company.  The writing was dry and pedantic in parts, but overall an interesting story of a fascinating business leader.	2000-12-26

Lee: A Biography	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Lee the Man and Warrior	This book is a biography of Lee the man, not an examination of one of our history's most notable generals.<br />The military side of Lee is, of course, a major part of Thomas's story.  However, he has attempted to paint a charactor study of Robert E. Lee so that his deportment and decisions during the Civil War can be seen to flow from a man molded by tradition, duty, honor and the uniquely historic family from which he came.<br />This means that the book spends much time on Lee's pre Civil War life as well as time delving into his relationships with his family and others.  The result is a readible book that gives the reader an entre into the man Robert E. Lee.  Those looking for a military expose or exploration may be somewhat disappointed, but this is still a worthwhile book.	2000-12-22

These men were starved, denied water, beaten, worked to death and stripped naked by an enemy who seemed not to know the spark of God or humanity.  The story is brutal, but provides an important witness of how man can be both a brutal animal and also an enlightened spirit.<br />Stewart and his friends survived their ordeals with a combination of Christian faith, love for each other and plain old tough mindedness.  Challenged every day, those attributes helped the men in riding out these toughest of circumstances.<br />This book is not a history of the prisoner experience, nor a detailed history of Stewart's own experience.  Rather, he uses both the searing atrocities visited upon his countrymen and the noble response of these brave men to present a richly textured testimony.  The book is important for what is shows of the nature and history of the human animal.  This book will stay with you.	2000-12-20

Although overshadowed by the latter, Sword is of the opinion that Thomas's eventual destruction of the Confederacy's western army was central to the Union's victory in our Civil War.  I'm not sure I'd go that far, but for savagry of combat, quirks of personality, and impact of military politics, its tough to beat.<br />The Battle of Franklin featured a Confederate charge that was arguably more costly and viscious than Pickett's at Gettysburg.  The Battle of Nashville featured a Union attack that was more thorough in it's success than perhaps any other similar scale engagement.  In the aftermath of the Battle of Spring Hill, lady luck smiled upon the Union more brightly than when she delivered Lee's &quot;cigar orders&quot; to McClellan before Anteitam.<br />General's Hood, Thomas, Cleborne, Schofield and other principals are fascinating characters whose personalities figured large in their conduct during the campaign.  Sword does a good job of describing these figures as men, providing enough backgorund to allow the reader to understand their motives and actions during the story.<br />This was a desperate winter campaign fought by Hood.  Sword correctly portrays him as a man elevated beyond his command capacity.  His soldiers valient and full of heart.  Hood's lack of tactical finess wastes them against the breastworks of Franklin.  He then marched them to confront Thomas's growing federal legions at Nashville.  A cold, ragged army enduring snow, sleet and sub zero temperatures was perhaps tempermentally ill suited to withstand the onslaught of Thomas's superior numbers.  When the final battle came, it removed an entire army from the Civil War Chessboard.<br />Sword is an engaging writer and this intersting story moves along.  The book is thorough but not boring.  The only weaknesses were the maps -- I did not think there were enough and some of the ones provided were not detailed enough to allow an easy visualization of the action. Sword also sometimes does not identify commanders as Union or Confederate, which can be confusing at the division or brigade level when one is relatively unfamiliar with these armies.<br />All in all, this in a very good book about a fascinating Civil War campaign.entire army from the Civil War Chessboard.<br />Sword is an engaging writer and this intersting story moves along.

The story is played against the backdrop of the Roosevelt White House (Teddy's), and an apparently true story involving the conservationist president's decision not to allow a cut tree into the White House because he want's to be a good example for Americans.<br />Of course TR's notoriously rebellious brood tries to outfox their dad by secretly procuring a pine tree and stashing it away, decorated, in a bedroom closet.  When discovered, TR marches the boys down to speak with Gifford Pinchot, his head of the US Forestry service.  Pinchot says that sometimes cutting small trees can actually be beneficial to forests as it gives room for other trees to thrive and grow.<br />With that OK, the live tree (although a small one in keeping with the chief of forestry's direction) is again welcome into the White House and is part of a festive christmas celebration.<br />This story interests my children.  Besides the Christmas hook, it involes the president and the White House, concepts they are familiar with.  It also teaches a conservation lesson.  Good book for the 4-7 set.	2000-12-13

This little book discusses the movement in America to disaggregate our nation into ethnic and gender subgroups.  It argues, persuasively in my mind, how this movement is dangerous and has the potential to subvert the mentality that has allowed America to reconcile itself to being a nation composed of others more successfully than any other polygot nation in history.<br />America has not achieved the transformation from ethnic peoples to an American people equally for all our citizens throughout much of our history.  However, it is unarguable that the attempt to allow anyone to assume the mantle &quot;American&quot; simply by embracing our national ideals and identity has been a success and is an important component of the moral strenth of our country.<br />Schlessinger's book is very readible.  Using historical analysis and logic, he renders an excellent case against the excesses of the multiculturalist movement and in favor of &quot;Americanism&quot; and a national identity (however one chooses to define it).<br />If there is one book that elected officials and school officials should read, this would be my choice.	2000-12-05

It also presents a solid critique of multiculturalism and well argued discourse concerning the potentially destructive results if the &quot;multi-culti&quot;  view of the US were ever fully implemented by the left.<br />Although not quite as lucid or compelling as Schlessinger's brilliant &quot;Disuniting of America,&quot; Miller's book is an important contribution to the growing debate regarding the nature of America's self image and the constant effort to build our country with the aid of new generations of newcomers.<br />Much of the history Miller presents is informative and interesting.  I was particularly fascinated to learn about the &quot;Americanization Societies&quot; and related programs funded by state and local governments and private philanthropic organizations at the beginning of the Twentieth Century.<br />This is a well researched and thorough book on the subject of Americanization and the assimilation of immigrants and newcomers in America.	2000-12-05

They are, after all closely related to horses -- why did Africans never make that leap to stripped horse flesh when their Eurasian cousins were able to commanded the non-stripped version thousands of years ago?<br />Diamond answers this question and provides other fascinating information in this extremely logical and well argued book (zebras have far nastier tempers than horses and are not domesticable).<br />This is human history at its most basic.  The question answered is why some peoples achieved more advanced developmental trajectories than others over the last ten thousand years.<br />Diamond's history is the history of homo sapiens, not historical man.  In fact, he shows how the history of our species interacted with basic geographical and biological facts in all parts of the world to produce &quot;history&quot; as most of us know it (at least through the age of colonialism).<br />This book proves, at its most elemental level, that people are people.  Which continents our ancestors migrated to almost totally explains the stage of development reached by different peoples five hundred years ago when world's collided.  In this, Diamond presents clear and convincing evidence and arguemnt that history up to a point was pre-ordained.<br />What elements preordained development levels among people? The presence or absence of domesticable plant and animal species and the breadth of lattitude possessed by the continents.  The Eurasian land mass was the clear winner in nature's draw which meant that those who were lucky enough to inhabit it had developed clear advantages over other peoples of the world by the time they met.<br />Diamond makes this point through clearly marshalled evidence, sound conclusions and simple yet elegant prose.<br />In this, the book is a breakthrough work:  it explains convincingly much about the lack of differences between peoples and the absolute importance of location, avaialable food and animal speciies in determining such critical success factors for development as agriculture, village life, and the emergence of writing and technology.<br />The title of this book more accurately could have been &quot;Lattitude, Grass Plants and Large Mammels.&quot;  Guns, germs and steel are not the focus, but the result of those percursor elements, which are discussed much more that the title words.

This book is about the policies, international relations, politics and style of America's third chief executive.  Running at less than 200 pages, McDonald manages to be both thorough and interesting in his telling of this period.<br />Jefferson and his Administration produced wonderful contradictions.  His party espoused a &quot;Republican&quot; philosophy that basically wanted to liberate Americans from Hamilton's financial system and Adam's heavy handedness as witnessed by the Alien and Sedition Acts.<br />Jefferson's early term saw him implement much of his program.  As McDonald points out, few if any other Presidents have had their way so successfully with Congress.  Jefferson also added greatly to the US through the Louisianna Purchase, despite his concerns with the Constitutionality of the aquisition.<br />Jefferson and his Administration reached rough shoals in foreign affairs.  Blinded by anti-British sentiment, the Administration prooved less than adroit at negotiating the position between Napolean and England.  America was buffetted by this struggle and it reverberated back on our domestic situation.  Suddenly, Jefferson's first term accomplishments became liabilities and were revealed as short sighted.  The scheduled reduction of America's debt through the slashing of the Navy budget left us without the ability to challenge foreign powers.  The abolition of Hamilton's system of internal revenues that left us entirely dependent upon tarriffs and thereby upon the grace of the British (who had the ability to determine how much trade our country could enjoy)for government revenue.<br />In the most surprising irony, Jefferson -- who had decried Adams and his anti-liberal legislation (Alien and Sedition Acts) would go much farther than Adams in restricting liberties and in executive arrogance through his Embargo Acts and various executive orders designed to limit trade with the European powers.<br />This is a fascinating story well told.  Besides the policies, McDonald gives insight as to how Jefferson governed, his relations with Congress and the Judiciary as well as the toll of the office on the man himself.

Don't let the 320 pages fool you -- this is a 250 page book goosed by large type and dialogue.  That's not a criticism.  In fact, Maas' brevity allows this true story to dominate the book without the background that can sometimes bog down these real-life adventure tales.<br />A great story it is.  On the eve of WWII, the American submarine Squalus sank on a training mission in 200 feet of water.  Fortunately for the submariners, Lt. Cmdr. Swede Momsen, a sub commander turned rescue expert, had worried about how to extract men from submerged vessels.  His worries led to the design of special breathing apparatus and a diving bell that could free men from sunk subs.  Prior to his efforts men stuck on a downed sub, even in relatively shallow water, had no way out.  A slow and cold death for those who survived an initial sinking was an absolute certainty as those on several American subs that went down in the 1920's and 1930's discovered.<br />Momsen, against bureaucratic indifference and even hostitlity, dedicated his life to developing the tools that gave such men a chance.<br />The Squalus disaster was his first chance to deploy his tools.  The rescue was able to save all of the men who had escaped (thirty-one) to dry compartments as the sub partly filled with water during it's test dive.<br />This is a gripping drama well told.  Maas weaves the story of Momsen's struggles to get sub rescue technology taken seriously in the Navy with the harrowing tale of the trapped mens' wait for delivery.<br />The book is a page turner and a very good read.  It's also short enough you could probably finish it in a day, if the mood strikes.	2000-11-01

The story of how various elements of our governing structure were arrived at is fascinating as well as illuminating to any serious student of the American system.  Important debates regarding the nature of the presidency, small state versus large state interests (how we got our Senate), the desirability of direct democracy versus state interests (part of how we got the Electoral College), the finessing of the slave issue -- its all here.<br />I read this book and was filled with a profound sense of pride and amazement at the story of how the &quot;gentlemen of Philadelphia&quot; were able to navigate such complex issues and arrive at the masterpiece that is our Constitution.<br />In Bowen's hands, this moving and patriotic story is well told and thoroughly explored.  I imagine many of you reading this review have this book on a political science syllabus, but it should be read by any with an interest in our Constitution or our government's history.	2000-11-01

He produced a wonderful full length bio of Alexander Hamilton that I recommend to anyone interested learning about our government's start and the role played by the man second only to Washington in ensuring that these United States succeeded in laying a firm foundation for self government.<br />This book is one of McDonald's two contributions to the Univ. of KA's &quot;Presidency Series.&quot;  It is splendid.<br />McDonald concisely explores the challenges presenting themselves and issues demanding attention from our new and untested government.  In just under two hundred pages, the author does an excellent job of boiling down the topics to their essentials and describing how the nascent government struggled to define its role, the meaning of it's constitutional structure, the balance of factions and America's relation to warring European giants.<br />His book accomplishes this with brevity, clear and concise writing and in an interesting manner.  Along the way are fascinating tidbits. For example, neither Washington nor the Senate knew what &quot;advise and consent&quot; meant regarding treaties.  About to send negotiators to several indian tribes, Washington walked down to the Senate to seek their advice on instructions for his agents.  As the Senate sat dumbfounded, and then finally began to debate the seven points Washington sought advice on, it became clear how impractical legislative micro management of treaty making would be.  Washington turned on his heels and left in disgust when it became obvious the Senate could not give him clear and definative advice.  Thereafter, it was mutually agreed that the Senate's role would revolve mainly around &quot;consent&quot; and come when the President presented negotiatied treaties to that body for consideration and not before the treaty making in the form of advice.  And thus has it been, evermore.<br />This is a very good book that will inform those interested in learning how our government got up and running and how important Washington and the players around him were in charting the course for our young government.our government got up and running and how important Washington and the players around him were in charting the course for our young government.	2000-10-27

Although seemingly two different elements for a single book, both sections reinforce each other in this very readable piece.<br />King's life story is important in depicting himself as one of us. He is undoubtedly very talented, and his God-given talents sustain him at a unique level among current authors. But the fact that this man -- with no special training, no pedigree in literature or the arts, and no bank account to let him begin his career as a gentleman author -- was able to succeed will be a comfort to those who are wondering if their non-literary background excludes them from trying to write the stories they possess within. King was the product of a struggling single parent and wrote his first work in the laundry room of a doublewide trailer. The fact that he wasn't a child of privilege or the son of Shakespearean actors or a literary major at an Ivy makes his career accessible to many. And, if it is accessible it can be replicated. (I'm speaking of the actual writing, not any guarantee of commercial success).<br />The second part of this book reveals King's rules for good writing. Some of them are very practical. He reveals which stylebook to have handy, how one must kill most adverbs and his approach to writing dialogue. King's &quot;toolbox&quot; is a good starting point of reference. He also reveals his method of writing: do the first draft without input, write in a quite place, commit to producing 2,000 words a day every day (your novel will be finished in only three months!). These are also very useful instructions. This practical commentary is easy to follow and replicate for those who want to give their try at putting a good story to paper. I suspect as I write that hundreds of additional Americans who have read &quot;On Writing&quot; are getting up an hour early before work and hammering away at the story they always thought of trying to set to written words. His book has that motivational quality to it and succeeds at showing that &quot;you too can write with enough discipline and commitment.&quot;<br />I found it interesting that King does not plot out his stories. He has faith in a story developing from an interesting situation. The author creates situations in his mind before undertaking a new book. The story develops out of how his characters react to each other and events. This for me was the most surprising element of the book. I have always assumed that every successful storyteller knew how the story was going to end along and his major plot lines before committing pen to paper.<br />King brings parts one and two of his book together in describing the accident that almost killed him and how a return to writing (this book, in fact), helped heal what had been a very broken man.<br />All in all, a good book that will inspire the aspiring writer and presents a good road map and excellent toolbox for those who would seek to emulate the Stephen Kings of the world.; are getting up an hour early before work and hammering away at the story they always thought of trying to set to written words.

All of the popularly known pirates, privateers and buccaneers (they are not one and the same) are mentioned:  Kidd, Blackbeard, English, Drake, etc.  Life on a typical pirate ship is explored as well as some of the more famous pirate attacks, their treatment of captives and the efforts to suppress their activities.  The author does go outside the bounds of pure history by discussing how pirates have been depicted in literature and film.<br />However, the presentation is somewhat disjointed and the author digresses often during this book.  The editing could also have been sharper; a few times the author reintroduces topics or persons previously covered as if they are being mentioned for the first time.<br />As a consequence, it does not read like a story or even a particularly well organized study.  It is rather more a survey that does inform but leaves the reader feeling that the gripping tale of piracy remains to be told in a more well written manner.	2000-10-05

The author tells the story of his unit's fight and subsequent movement well.  So well, that it is possible to visualize the battle, the defensive perimiter and keep the individual soldiers -- whose story it is -- straight. Not only is the tale of the battle well told, but the fears and uncertainty faced by cut off troops who could not see their enemy and knew they had to hold their perimiter is brought home to the reader.  This story has plenty of heroics, but also a lot of fear, anger and luck.<br />The story also underscores the problem with U.S. strategy in Vietnam.  Unlike World War II, our troops were not driving across the country to hold land and capture territory.  Many missions, like Moore's, were designed to find and harass a jungle hid enemy, inflict casualties and then retreat to a well protected base.  That type of war without gain must have played heavily on the minds of the soldiers who could not measure their sacrifice in ground gained or villages freed, measurements their fathers and uncles had been able to see in their great war.<br />This is a good book.  Moore's US infantry are very sympathetic (the chopper pilots merrit special mention from the author), doing a hard job and doing it well.  It reads quickly and is captured my attention from the outset.	2000-10-03

I was daunted by it's length and actually had it hanging around my office for a month before deciding to wade in.  Needless worry on my part.  Larry McMurty's classic cowboy novel is one of the most delicious works of fiction I have ever read.<br />This is a book about the Old West.  Cowboys, Texas Rangers, whores, gamblers, drinkin', cattle, indians, sheriffs, cattle drives, the Plains --- its all here.  The main story revolves around a group of retired Texas Rangers, bored with running a minor ranch in the two-bit town of Lonesome Dove, who decide to take one of the last great adventures left in a West that is almost conquored.  They decide to gather and drive a cattle herd from the Rio Grand to Montanna -- one of the last open areas where men could stake a claim and subjugate raw land.<br />What McMurty does so well is craft believable and highly entertaining characters.  Gus and Call, the two Rangers are two of American literatures most memorable figures.  The story revolves around their ambitions -- very different as are their personalities -- and the way they affect about twenty or so other characters who people the book.<br />This is a big book.  It has several strong sub plots that could have been novels in themselves.  The author ties each together in a manner that lends the unembarrassed moniker of epic to the whole.<br />The characters are each well developed and believable.  Human to the last, there are no super heros here -- no Tom Clancy like Jack Clarks who can do no wrong.  But several of the major characters are heroic in their struggles to survive and overcome the rough obstacles that frontier life often entailed.  They are made more believable because of their flaws and mistakes and the less than direct paths they follow in following their souls.  The villains and those in between are also memorably drawn and made full in the telling of this tale.<br />The West protrayed in Lonesome Dove is not the type found in Hollywood protrayals.  McMurty's West is brutal, lonely and very tough.  Living is hard, life often tragic and cheap.  The joys are either hard earned or purchased in the form of liquor and/or women.  Altogether a more realistic portrayal of life at the edge of law and civilization than the romanticized version often held forth in movies.<br />McMurty's dialogue is wonderful, creating a warmth that makes the characters stay with the reader.  This is a book I could not put down and was sorry to finish.  A treasure that any devote of good fiction will enjoy.  &quot;Dern good,&quot; as Gus Mcrae would say.protrayals.

I  have read his &quot;Confederates in the Attic,&quot; an often hilarious  writing that delves into the shadow of the Civil War in the current  South.<br />Like &quot;Confederates...,&quot; &quot;Baghdad Without a  Map&quot; is breezy, funny and illuminating.  The author spent three years  in the Middle East in the period before the Gulf War.  Stationed in Cairo,  this free lance writer visited Israel (during the Infatada) Lebanon (during  active warfare), Iraq (during its war with Iran), Iran (during Khomeni's  funeral), Yemen, the Sudan and The U.A.Emerites and Libya.  In each  country, he gets off of the beaten track to meet with ordinary people and  delve into their daily existence.<br />What emerges is a picture of life under  Islam that as a whole is very much different from that experienced in the  West, but one that also varies tremendiously among the individual  countries.  Each is shaped in a unique way by georgraphy, the relative  lunacy of its political autocrats and history.  The book serves to  highlight some of the difficult problems facing many of the people in the  region as well as the basic humanity and hope that can thrive even under  trying circumstances.<br />Horwitz does not laugh at the people he meets, in  fact he is quite sympathetic to many of them he becomes acquainted with.  However, many of the situations in which they are placed as well as  Horwitz's response while diving into very different cultures from his own  are often witty and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny in the hands of this  skilled observer and writer.  This is one of those books that will cause  you to chuckle and guffaw even in places of public quiet like the commuter  train on which I ride.<br />His book is fast, very enjoyable and leaves the  reader with something of substance after it's finished.  A good book.	2000-09-17

Delaware, located on Pea Patch Island in the Delaware River.<br />For the  Delaware enthusiast, this book will fascinate.  For the Civil War buff,  this book provides an interesting view of post life and northern prison  administration -- topics not well covered in the popular literature.<br />Pea  Patch Island was recognized as a crucial spot on which to construct a down  river defense to America's great port at Philadelphia as early as the  Revolution.  Then bureaucracy, sloth and quabbles over funding delayed  construction of this &quot;vital&quot; defensive bastion for more than half  a century.  It must be recognized though, that this was no easy constructin  job.  Pea Patch Island is a low lying mud deposit without solid foundation.  The fort eventually came to rest on more than six thousand timber pilings,  all of which had to be driven by pile drivers of the 1800's.<br />Immediately  upon it's occupation, prisoners of state and then surrendered Confederates  began arriving and Ft. Delaware's historic mission -- wholly unintended --  as a major Union prisoner of war camp was realized.<br />What Fetzer does well  is provide this neglected story with some flavor and detail.  We learn  about the constructin of the Fort, daily life of both prisoners, guards and  attendant civilians, the personalities who commanded, built or were  remanded to the fort and the way in which Ft. Delaware did its duty in the  Civil War.<br />Fetzer provides some interesting details and analysis.  I had  never known how the island got its name, an interesting story that Fetzer  tells.  Significantly, those who view Ft. Delaware as &quot;the  Andersonville of the North&quot; will be enlightened and realize that while  death was a possibility in such crowded conditions among the South's often  diseased and malnourished troops (they arrived that way), the death rate  was not even close to that realized in the South's prisoner of war camps.  In addition, the commanders at Ft. Delaware provided covered housing, fresh  water, regular meals, medical care and a camp hospital -- features all  lacking or practically useless at the real Andersonville.<br />All in all,  this is an iteresting little book and a must for anyone who collects  Delawareanna.oner of war camps.

Like other readers, I only knew the men  in the photo as Marines, not as individuals.  Bradley has written an  interesting and moving book by telling the stories of the men who were the  &quot;flag raisers.&quot;<br />Bradley does an excellent job of introducing us  to the boys (one of who is the author's father) of the 1930's and 1940's  who would achieve fame in Rosenthal's photo.  These are fascinating  subjects, who we grow to care about very early in the book.  They are  simple boys/men doing their duty, growing up in poverty and working class  homes and thrust (the three flag raisers who survived the battle) into a  limelight that two of the three did not seek nor enjoy.<br />This book is a  love note to the author's dad and the men who both survived and perished on  Iwo Jima.  In this the book is moving, sympathetic and patriotic.  Though  not a thorough telling of the battle, nor a complete biography of the flag  raisers, this book combines elements of both to make compelling reading of  simple men and the impact The Photograph had on their lives and the nation.  By focusing on a handfull of enlisted men, Bradley creates an excellent  flavor of what it was like in the war and how it changed men who went  through it.	2000-09-09

This book is part travelogue, part mid-life crisis  expose, and part treatise on aspects of the ever changing American woods  and its flora and fauna.<br />Bill Bryson describes well the often spectacular  aspects of America's foremost trail.  It traverses across most of the  eastern states, through mountain ranges and several different kinds of  arboreal landscapes.  The thought of two middle aged guys who are not  exactly specimens of the trim and fit male embarking on a months long  journey involving outdoor sleeping, portage of their supplies and comforts  and a self-reliance most only encounter in history books is oddly  appealing.  It is not too difficult for me to envision myself in their  place -- at least at the start of their hike when good intentions had yet  to be tested against the dreary sameness of each mile.  Thus it was easy to  root for the two wanderers as surrogates making the great adventures many  have taken only in our minds, those escapes that seem far removed from  reality by the conditions and responsibilities of everyday existence.  I  think the book will appeal to many who want, if only occassionally, the  chance to do something really different that lasts more than two weeks and  does not involve Disneyland.<br />Bryson delivers on the story with a well  written book.  This book is not a day by day or mile by mile diary of their  walk.  He judiciously intersposes episodes from the trail with discussions  of the history of the trail, the story of the national parks service, the  effect of settlement and coexistence on animal and vegtible life and his  relationship with &quot;Katz,&quot; his travel companion, foil and the  source for much of the wit that enlivens the tale.<br />There is much to  amuse.  Besides Katz, the hikers encounter interesting fellow travelers and  Bryson turns his own missteps into humorous prose.<br />This is a well written  book that will amuse the reader and hold his or her interest.

Meet<br />Clay, Polk, Stevens, Blaine, Reed, Cannon, Longworth, Rayburn and<br />Gingrich as they work their will on their members to controll the<br />legislative process.<br />By examining the role of congressional<br />leadership through history and historic personalities, this book both<br />illustrates how the House has changed and how the nature of power<br />hasn't. These men relied on personal relationships, codes of honor<br />that won respect and a willingness to exercise power (ie, risk tough<br />battles, reward friends and punish enemies) to run the House.<br />Both<br />the history buff and those interested in leadership studies will find<br />this book interesting.  Though well written, the book is short.  I<br />think that it could have delved into more detail of some of the<br />political battles these men faced and still been fascinating.  Maybe<br />Dick Cheney will have the time to expand upon this theme as Vice<br />President -- there is a lot of opportunity for writing while jetting<br />to and from foreign funerals (as John Nance Garner -- FDR's 1st VP --<br />said &quot;the job's not worth a bucket of warm spit!).	2000-08-30

LBJ's Pure Will to Succede Examined	Although Presidents and national politicians are very different from you  and me, LBJ stands out among presidential personalities due to his  indomitable will to succede.<br />Dallek writes a fascinating portrait of  Johnson and his route to national preeminence.  A poor boy from the hill  country of Texas, LBJ should not have risen much above the station of his  relatives or neighbors.  He had none of the advantages that most other  notables of his era enjoyed.  But he did have an incredible hunger to  achieve and he developed uncanny political and personal skills that made  him perhaps the moste effective Senate Majority Leader in our history (this  volume only takes LBJ's life up through his ascention to the Vice  Presidency).<br />This book is fascinating as the author delves into each  challenge faced by Johnson.  We quickly see him learn what is necessary to  master his immediate situation (college, congressional staffer,  congressman, senator), understand perhaps better than those around him what  buttons his colleagues and supporting cast needed  pushed to aid Johnson in  achieving his goals and use his incredible persuasive powers to bend others  to his will.<br />Dallek uses innumerable personal recollections as well as  published sources to minutely document Johnson's rise.  He is a skillful  enough author that the wealth of information does not bore, but illuminates  a fascinating personality and a well written study.<br />As a reader, I could  not help but be fascinated by LBJ's life story and this disseciton of his  methods.  Whether or not you agreed with LBJ's political goals and  philosophies, one can appreciate his mastery of the process necessary to  implement them.<br />This is a first rate presidential biography	2000-08-29

It takes a  different view of presidential history by focusing on the family life of  Franklin and Elanor Roosevelt and the life enjoyed by their official family  during their White House years.<br />By focusing on the perosnal side, this  book provides glimpses at facets of the Roosevelt story that are either  ignored by standard histories or covered in passing.  That is not to say  this book is not serious history -- it is -- just from a different vantage  point.  One is much more likely to learn about FDR the man (and Eleanor the  woman) than thay would in say James McGreggor Burn's excellent FDR  biography.  There are also excellent passages on their relationships with  the luminaries who made the time...Churchill, Hopkins, Ikes and the New  Deal crew.  Since so much related to getting things done revolves around  relationships, this focus helps in the understanding of how the great  events of the 1930's came to be.<br />The gossipy stuff is in here too --  affairs, the questions surrounding Eleanor's &quot;friends&quot; and FDR's  personal foibles and habits.  Goodwin to her credit does not treat these  issues salaciously, but as part of the story to understanding the  Roosevelts.<br />She is an excellent author and has produced a very enjoyable  history of her subjects.  Can't wait for her upcoming book on the day to  day activities of President Lincoln.  It she meets this standard, that will  be a fascinating book.	2000-08-29

The Title, &quot;...Lion and the Fox&quot; is an allusion to  Machiavelli's dictum that one must be stouthearted like a lion and crafty  like a fox.  FDR combined these qualities to achieve political mastery of  his time.<br />This book focus on his life up to the start of WWII.  It paints  a thorough life portrait of the president and illustrates the events and  experiences that shaped this master politician.  Although enjoying  congressional majorities like no other president (that certainly aided the  implementation of his program), FDR had to over come the reluctance of both  GOP and Democrat conservatives to rework the federal government into the  active economic and social player it is today.  McGreggor's book explains  how FDR the man made the New Deal possible.<br />This is a well written book  that gives evidence of being thoroughly researched.

The fate of the world may really have been in the balance when Eisenhower  decided to send thousands of young Americans, British and Canadians ashore  during a break in what was very bad weather for an invasion.  Their mission  was successful and Hitler's Atlantic Wall was breeched.  The opening that  the Allies needed to insure that Nazism would be removed from Eurpope was  paid for with the blood and bodies of young men on D-Day.<br />For Ambrose  fans, this book does not disappoint.  His success here is in weaving what  is a big story with the impressions of the individuals who gave this big  story a good ending.  The big story consisted of the face off of the  Germans and Allies over where and when an invasion would take place, the  planning and preparation for an immense invasion, the weather factor and  the pressure on Eisenhower who had responsibility for unleashing the  attack.  The individual sagas of infantrymen who met the enemy and  sometimes death on the coast of France give the book majesty and  poignantcy.  Ambrose has taken many memoires from the ranks and from junior  officers.  These first person accounts make the book extremely gripping and  personal.<br />He weaves his elements together well.  Even one familiar with  the story of DDay, whether from Ryan or Keegan or another excellent  chronicler will find much to like in Ambrose's take on the Sixth of June,  1944.	2000-08-28

For those wishing to become aquainted with a chronicle of his life, McFeely's book  will do the job.<br />Born a slave in Maryland, Douglass accomplished the  difficult task of self education in an era when slaves were not taught  under penalty of law.  &quot;Running away with himself&quot; (as  Southerners used to describe slaves who escaped) twenty years before the  Civil War, he became one of our country's great orators in telling the tale  of his life as a bondsman and urging that America embrace emancipation of  all slaves.  He was perhaps the anti-slavery movement's best spokesman.  Not only for the sheer eloquence with which he captivated audiences, but as  living proof that a black could be educated to a level reached by few  people of any race.<br />Douglass did his part for the Union in the Civil War  and bought into Republicanism as the best political vehicle for achieving  the end of slavery and the leveling up of blacks to their rightful place in  American society.  His hopes were frustrated after the Civil War when his  party turned away from Reconstruction and blacks were subjugated anew by  racism, indifference and Jim Crowism.<br />Douglass was an idealist in that he  believed that America could be exhorted into granting slaves not only their  freedom but their civil rights and social equality.  His country failed his  vision miserably and he ended his life personnally successful (as  successful as his skin color could take him in the 1890's) but very  distraught at the chasm between his hopes for a free America and the  reality.<br />This is an adequate book, though dry at times. It follows  Douglass chronologically.  In episodes where his life was a fascinating  story -- as a slave, his escape, his establishment in the North, as a  politician and as US minister to Haiti -- the book is a fascinating tale.  Not so fascinating are long accounts of his work on the road delivering  speeches as an agent of the anti-slavery movement.  Part of the problem  with writing a biography of a man who was in large part a professional  orator is that the chapters focusing on that work are not very exciting.  Mcfeely spends a lot of ink detailing his journies on the stump and his  meetings with many characters who were part of the American and English  anti-slavery movements.  Douglass's life flow, when examined  chronologically, produces a story of varying degrees of drama.  Although  any biograhpher is limited by his character, I had the feeling throughout  that Douglass's life could be told with more verve without sacrificing the  facts.<br />What McFeely should have jettisoned were several parts where he  delved into psychobabble -- speculations about sexual attraction or the  depth of feeling between Douglass and several figures in his life.  Human  feelings and attractions are an important part of any biography and  certainly shaped Douglass's life.  McFeeley speculates on several without  any facts to support his views.  These are relegated to the first half of  the book and do not intrude greatly, however.<br />If one needs or wants to  learn about the life of this great American, McFeeley's book will fill the  bill.es as an agent of the anti-slavery movement.

Along the way, he provides a good snapshot of modern  presidential politics.<br />What is revealed are hard driven men, who are  willing to sacrifice all other concerns to their political ambitions.  Although Bush, Gore, Dukakis, Hart, Biden, Dole and the others have very  different life stories and personalities, they are very similar in their  focus, drive and ego.  This book provides biographical sketches of each as  well as an insiders view of their 1988 campaigns.  Knowing Delaware's Biden  a little, I would say that he captures at least that character fairly  accurately.<br />The only complaint with this book is that Cramer takes great  liberties with his characters in telling their stories.  He can not know  what they were thinking exactly during all the vignettes he paints, yet he  writes as if he were the central character and he had intimate knowledge of  conversations, feelings and dialogue.  Cramer also draws many conclusions  from the life portraits of his characters.  This style is not unenjoyable,  but one should be forwarned that the author writes in the &quot;gonzo&quot;  journalism style that sounds more authoritative than it could possibly be.  This is the type of writing that makes these types of books difficult to  rely on as historical sources, but can present an interesting story.<br />What it Takes is very readable and enjoyable.	2000-08-27

Bartlett's is  indespensible if your style accomodates the quoting of others.  For those  moments when I must mark events (Memorial Day) or meet an expectation of  seriousness I find Bartlett's to be an excellent source for just the right  phrase.<br />This is a massive reference book, which is good in and of itself.  Where Bartlett's really shines is in it's organization.  Quotes in the  body are arranged chronologically and by author.  The index is superb, with  quotes locatable by subject and author.  For most topics, the writer will  be confronted with multiple quotes from which to choose which best  illustrates the heft and value of this tome.<br />My only criticism, which has  been noted by other commentators, is that this latest edition does seem to  be moderately invaded by political correctness.  For example, the quotes  selected to characterize Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher almost seem to  be designed to belittle their historic contributions and commentary --  while much more historic and significant utterances are ignored (missing  for example are &quot;Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,&quot; or any of  Reagan's wonderful D-Day commemmoration speech).  I personnally find this  annoying because my need for quotes does run to the political.  One also  gets the sneaky suspicion that some of the newer entries were inserted for  reasons other than the significance or value of the quote.<br />That said  however, the book is an excellent resource.  It is rich, covering almost  any topic you may want to highlight and reaches back to beyond biblical  times for quotable utterances.  A must for any reference library.	2000-08-16
2324695:US	52882573	R2RU4Q6E1W5FEJ	0553212788	604725626	The Prince (Bantam Classics)	Books	5	711	756	N	N	Realistic Map of How Power is Achieved and Maintained	There are two good reasons to read Machiavelli's classic, &quot;The Prince.&quot;<br />First, so you'll know what everyone is referring to when  you come across the adjective &quot;machiavellian&quot; in news stories or  other media.  This adjective has become so commonplace (and overused) it is  almost a cliche.  Also, most who use it have never read this letter from  Machiavelli, a Rennaisance courtier to his Prince (written from prison),  but they insist on peppering writings with this noun turned adjective so  much that as a matter of clearly understanding what is meant by the term,  famiality with this brief treatise is helpful.<br />Second, this book does  describe most (not all) power situations very well.  From politics to  corporations to most settings where advancement, influence and control  exist, Machiavelli's observations and rules apply.<br />You will also discover  that Machiavelli was not as evil as he is understood to be in popular  thought.  What he was doing was describing the rules of the game that have  existed and always will exist for many situations involving selfish humans  in competition.  Machiavelli's rules are neither good nor bad in themselves  -- they describe a process.  What is good or bad is how those who master  Machiavelli's rules use their power and position, in a society that tempers  actions according to law and basic Judeo-Christian principals.  When those  principals do not exist (as in Nazi Germany, the Middle Ages or under  Communism, or by those who refuse to live by these constraints),  Machiavelli's rules take on their demonic and evil cloak; usually because  they serve demonic and evil ends.  In societies where positive constraints  exist, for example the U.S. political system, Machiavellian behavior can  produce excellent results.  A good example involves Abraham Lincoln, whose  ambition led him to use every legitimate trick and stragety to master (and  remove) political opponents.  His mastery of Machiavellian behavior  constrained by the US political system allowed him to save the Union and  end slavery.<br />To fully appreciate the modern lessons that can be taken  from this writing, one must translate Medieval sensibilites to their  contemporary counterparts.  The casual way in which Machiavelli discusses  the need to kill opponents was necessary to those who wished to be princes  500 years ago.  Today, of course, &quot;killing&quot; is translated as  rendering less powerful, or taking an opponent out of the game.<br />What does  one get from this book?  It is a roadmap with insights and lessons about  how to 1) get ahead of others to attain power; and 2) maintain and expand  one's power in the face of others who would usurp one who is in a desirable  position.<br />This book is about ruthlessness and putting the attainment of  goals ahead of any other consideration.  Plenty of maxims that are also  tossed about frequently in media are to be found in Machiavelli's book:  &quot;the end justifies the means,&quot; &quot;it is better to be feared  than loved,&quot; &quot;if you fight the prince, kill the prince&quot; to  name a few.<br />It is essential reading to anyone who would be in a  competitive environment and hope to advance, if for no other reason than  many of one's competitors operate by Machiavelli's dictums (which arise out  of human instinct and selfishness).  One does not have to operate according  to Machaivelli's code -- many examples of alturism and &quot;pluck and  luck&quot; exist to defeat any claim that Machiavelli's road map is  essential for success.  However, human nature and human history deliver far  more examples of ruthless self-interest (Machiavellianism) behind success  in power situations.<br />Is Machiavellianism bad?  Not in and of itself.  Remember, one must translate the Middle Age ethos to current practices --  there usually isn't blood spilled as a result of today's Machiavellian  duels, just power and positon.  Most political and business leaders are at  least partly Machiavellian.  The trick is using one's power to good ends.  Thus, even though Lincoln and all of our presidents were Machiavellian in  their climb to  the White House, some of them did darn good work there.  The same is true for business leaders.  Jack Welch (GE), Bill Gates  (Microsoft), anyone who advances past the first few rungs of the corporate  ladder or dominates markets at the expense of competitors is using  Machiavelli's dictums.  The trick of a just and good society is to set the  bounds by which power can be attained and exercised so that good and  benefits will flow from those who are able to &quot;claw their way to the  top.&quot;<br />To summarize, read this book if you want to 1) truly  understand when the adjective &quot;Machiavelli&quot; is used to describe  people and 2) understand the rules by which most people navigate their way  to power.eaders are at  least partly Machiavellian.

If the reader is looking to gain an understanding of a critical area of Revolutionary War  operations in the Carolinas -- an area that has not received its due in  history -- this book will more than satisfy.<br />Although often beating  General Washington in the middle colonies, the British had certainly not  subdued the Revolution in Pennsylvania, New Jersey or New York.  They  looked to Charleston and the Carolinas as an area where British arms could  provide succor to loyalists and take those states and Georgia out of the  war.<br />The British won many battles, including the taking of Charleston and  the capture of 5,000 rebels.  But they could not win hearts and minds nor  subdue the countryside.  Rebel militia, aided by some of the finest  Continental units sent by Washington, were married with a master strategy  and excellent generaliship to bloody, thwart and ultimately force a  stragetic defeat on British arms.  This was done by volunteers, milita, who  though often broke when confronted by the bayonets of regular troops, were  led by enough able colonels that their guerilla attacks significantly drew  upon British strength.<br />The hero of the story is Gen. Nathaniel Greene,  who was an excellent strategist.  He mastered geography, his troops and  militia commanders and drew Cornwallis hundreds of miles away from his base  withoug exposing his weaker force to major battle until he was ready to  strike upon fields of his own choosing.  Greene never won a battle which he  personnaly commanded, but won the war.  General Morgan, his able  lieutenant, did fight and win the masterful Battle of Cowpens, which gave  in his words the British a &quot;devil of a whipping&quot; and set the  stage for Greene's brilliant strategic dance with Cornwallis.<br />Buchannon,  the author, does a masterful job with this wonderful saga.  He uses many  first person accounts from diaries and published recollections.  This gives  his book an immediacy and perspective from those who fought similar to that  found in the best Civil War books by Sears, Priest and others.  The author  does an excellent job of revealing the major commanders to the reader.  Greene, Morgan, Gates, Cornwallis, Clinton, Marion, Sumpter, Tarleton and  about two dozen other significant charactors are introduced with brief  biographical sketches at their point of entry to the campaign.  This is  very helpful as the experience and charactor of commanders often had a  significant impact on strategy and tactics employed in the dangerous  circumstances most faced.  Also, this approach satisfies the curiosity of  the reader.  Buchannon tells us what the actors did before and what became  of them after the war.<br />The best part about this book is that it is so  well written.  The author has a style and ease with language that make this  very engaging.  He is not afraid to editorialize nor draw conclusions and  offer criticisms.  But he presents significant and multiple sources to  buttress his observations and they add to the book.<br />This campaign was at  its heart a brutal civil war.  Neighbor fought neighbor in actions where  sometimes no quarter was given. The British under Banestre Tarleton (Bloody  Ban)were particularly brutal, burning, raping and slashing their way  through a back country they hoped to ally with their presence and draw  support from.  Their behavior forced many passive citizens to the rebel  side and greatly complicated the efforts of Cornwallis to receive native  support. Often the actions were all american affairs of Tories fighting  militia.

Instead, he has delivered a  well researched, balanced and ultimately fascinating study of the president  and his presidency.<br />I learned a lot of new information in this book.  The  author appears to have uncovered documents used for the first time here.  There are also abundent interviews with people not always found in other  Kennedy manuscripts.  His work is very fresh due to this painstaking  assembling of new information and sources.<br />President Kennedy was very  good at some things, such as motivating followers and creating an aura that  helped him govern, and not so good at others.  Among his flaws, Reeves sees  his system of managing the government.  Kennedy had much information flow  to him directly -- a &quot;hub and wheel&quot; organization for managing  the govenrment -- as oppossed to a solid staff system that could make  ordained decisions on small issues in keeping with administration  philosophy and reserve the president's time for the big issues that  ultimately matter.  His personal failings are also laid bare and counted as  a flaw in this book.<br />This is a balanced book of a president who too often  public memory reflects differently from reality.  Reeves has written a very  solid and fascinating portrait of the reality.	2000-08-07

What is a fascinating story unfortunately disappoints in Mr.  Utley's hands.<br />The information relating to scores of major tribes during  several decades of relationship with the US involves a large cast.  This  book presents the briefest of sketches relating to conflicts, treaty  negotiations and battles.  Characters pop into the book and disappear just  as quickly.  The middle of the book provides a chronological accounting of  the two decades after the Civil War, and that is where it has its  difficulty.  Perhaps this is just too thin a book to cover such a broad  expanse.  What is presented in this middle is a recitation of vignettes,  persons and events, none presented in enough detail to grip the reader or  provide any meaningful flavor to this narrative.<br />The author has more luck  in his chapters that are not chronological.  They book-end the story.  A  brief on how American indian policy arrived to mid century (1800's) and two  at the end on the Indian reform movement and the closing of the frontier  are much more tightly written and interesting.<br />I think the author just  tried to accomplish too much and ended up with a broad brush stroke of what  should be a fascinating story.  The material reads like a school text book,  facts are presented rather than a story told.  This makes for dry reading  at times.<br />Overall, this is a passable book for anyone wanting to get an  overview of Plains Indian history.  For those wanting a fascinating story,  they may want to check out Connell's Son of the Morning Star.	2000-07-30

On its way to the moon, a tank blew out,  causing a partial systems failure and raising the possibility that the  three man crew might not be able to return safely to earth -- or even  intercept our planet to try a reentry. (they faced the very real  possibility of skipping off of the earth's atmosphere and traveling forever  through the cosmos).<br />Although filled with technical talk, this book is  very much a human story.  It is filled with heros:  the astornauts, the men  at Mission Control who guided them safely back and the wives who very  publicly waited to see if their husbands might be martyred to our  scientific ambitions.  Lovell puts this all very much into perspective.  He  gives excellent background of his preparation as well as the planning for  the mission.  The critical days aboard the spacecraft and at Mission  Control as all of the problems associated with bringing him back alive are  solved are as fascinating and as absorbing as any Tom Clancy  novel.<br />Lovell tells a great story in a superb manner	2000-07-20

It is a balanced presentation of George Armstrong Custer, the post-Civil War Indian Wars, Plains Indians and the myth of the Battle of the Little Big Horn.<br />Facts abound.  I  started this book thinking it would primarily focus on Gen. Custer and the  fight.  While those topics are the framework of the book, Connell spends  quite a bit of time exploring various indian chiefs, indian practices,  previous conflicts and the conditions that produced one of our country's  most celebrated battles.  First person quotes are abundent and the author  usually produces two or more sides to every episode.  These explorations  underscore how difficult getting at a true history is, particulary when  pride and ego rest on a particular telling of an event.  He has done very  good research.<br />This is a brutal book.  American and indian savagry are  laid bare.  Warfare and existence on the frontier were not pretty. The  &quot;rules&quot; of war were abandoned by both sides with regard to the  taking of prisoners or the frequent butchering of women and children along  with those unlucky enough to be in the path of maurading soldiers or indian  bands.  Connell's book leaves no doubt that American notions of racial  superiority, mainfest destiny and economics created the situation in which  the indians would fight in the extreme to protect their lands from white  encroachment.  However, the author also underscores that most of the indian  tribes were brutal and ruthless when attacking other tribes, lone indians  and in their own rituals and customs.  Had America respected it's indian  treaties, it can be argued that the indian lands still would have had  atrocities visited upon them as various tribes concentrated their full time  attentions on settling the wrongs each felt had been metted out by other  red men.  His refusal to treat the indian as a politically correct  manifestation of mother nature is refreshing and allows for a very balanced  telling of the story.<br />The author has a unique writing style.  He doesn't  come to a fork in the road without taking it.  These side tracks and  tangents allow him to explore in full the charactors and milieu attendent  to The Last Stand.  However, they are presented in no particular order or  chronology.  The author paints a strong impression rather than presenting  an ordered and structured telling of a compelling tale.  This incohesion is  so pronounced that the end of a chapter has no meaning other than to allow  one to catch one's breath before plunging into the next twenty pages of  free associations.<br />My opinion of this book changed several times during  my reading.  In the beginning, I found it hard to get into because of it's  meandering style. But the vignettes, characters, facts and writing are all  compelling.

David Herbert Donald's will stand the test of time and emerge like Sandberg's as one of the classics.<br />Donald is very thorough with his research and weaves the  immense amount of material available on Lincoln into a wonderful story that  captures his life.  The hardscrabble beginnings are here, as well as the  intense desire and ambition that steeled Lincoln for the incredible  challenges he faced holding the Union together through a successful waging  of the Civil War.<br />Donald's prose is clear and succinct.  I personnally  find his Lincoln more accessible than Sandberg's (although it too is a very  good biography).  Donald mixes enough vignettes of Lincoln the human being  with the story of Lincoln the emancipator and savior of the union to  present a thoroughly engaging picture of our great president.	2000-07-11

His skill does justice to an epic story of recent times: the building of the Panama Canal.<br />This big book is necessary to tell a big tale. The effort to build the Path Between the Seas across the isthmus of Panama lasted from the 1870's through 1914. In a nutshell, first the French tried and failed to build a sea level crossing at Panama. This was in pursuit of a vision held by many national leaders in order to cut thousands of miles from the journey from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans. The Americans picked up where the French left off, and after a decade succeeded in creating a crossing using locks and a man-made lake.<br />What McCollough does so well is flesh out the above nutshell. It is a tale that would not be believed if written as fiction. The level of incompetence, misfeasance and malfeasance, wondrously peculiar personalities, engineering failures and brilliance, vision and size astound the reader and underscore how that age relied more upon enthusiasm, idealism and optimism in the pursuit of grand efforts than does our careful and measured era.  The French followed the builder of the Suez Canal into the jungles of Panama. Tens of thousands of French families invested their life savings in the stock of a company that had no plans for the actual canal, very little good data of conditions on the isthmus, no idea of the amount of earth required to be removed, and no budget that would pay for the grand adventure. After spending the 1870's and 1880's mired in the jungle, losing tens of thousands (mostly black Caribbean workers -- the people who really built the canal) to disease and accident, raising increasingly more expensive capital in desperate gambles to stay afloat, the French effort collapsed. Shame, ignominy and jail awaited some of the project leaders. Their effort will amaze the reader -- that such an ill-conceived (that's too much of a compliment it wasn't even conceived at all beyond &quot;we'll dig it -- viva la France!&quot;) undertaking could consume much of the savings of middle class France reminds one of how susceptible people can be to charlatans and swindlers.<br />Into the breach stepped Teddy Roosevelt. This story once again displays the Presidents immense force of personality, drive and integrity. Evidence strongly suggests he made a revolution in Panama to win that then Colombian province away from a country that could not come to terms with the United States on acquiring the rights to dig the canal. He then ensured, through the use of highly skilled and able administrators, that the organization, logistics, financing and authority existed to make what for years stood as the world's largest construction effort. Great credit for the actual building goes to several engineers and their staff -- many US Army engineers. The success also greatly rested on Col. Gorgas and his partially successful efforts to battle disease: yellow fever, malaria and a host of others that had cost upwards of 200 of every thousand the French employed a generation earlier.<br />McCollough brings scores of fascinating personalities to light. He tells of the financial and great political battles that attended all of the stages of the canal effort. The engineering and workings of the canal are simply and clearly laid out. The important efforts to improve sanitation and fight the mosquito borne diseases are succinctly explained. All of these elements are rendered interesting and tightly woven in this very good book.compliment it wasn't even conceived at all beyond &quot;we'll dig it -- viva la France!&quot;) undertaking could consume much of the savings of middle class France reminds one of how susceptible people can be to charlatans and swindlers.<br />Into the breach stepped Teddy Roosevelt.

Drawing heavily on diary entries, he follows the course of the 1st Minnesota Volunteers during the Civil War. The unit had a rather typical experience of front line Union combat  regiments.  Until Gettysburg.  Resting on Cemetary Ridge on July Second,  they (all 262) were fortuitously (for the rest of the Union Army) available  to throw against onrushing Confederates who had a chance to take the center  of the Union line.  Gen. Hancock ordered them forward, telling their  Colonel to take the oncoming flag of the much more numerous rebels.  In a  shocking movement, the Minnesotans did their duty, knowing that they were  being sacrificed so that the Union side could live to fight another day.  They were successful, blunting the southerners.  The cost:  the 1st  Minnesota had more causualties than any other Union regiment at  Gettysburg.<br />Moe lets his fellow Minnesotans do much of the speaking which  lends great authenticity to the tale.  This is a heroic story of grand  sacrifice during the unit's unique moment in history.  It also offers an  informative telling of life on the road with the Army of the Potmac during  the first three years of the war.<br />(Moe describes being enthralled by a  painting of the 1st Minnesota's heroic charge that hangs in that state's  state house as a youth.  It helped create a mental image that led to his  writing the book.  It also gave me the idea to tell a similar story of  bravery via a painting in Delaware's state house.  Next January, the State  of Delaware will hang an oil by Bradley Schmehl in Legislative Hall in  Dover, DE.  The painting will depict the 2nd Delaware advancing through the  Wheatfield during the Battle of Gettysburg, an action that helped secure  the flank of Gen. Sickle's Corps during a time when it was threatened with  being rolled up and opeining the Union center).	2000-06-26

Like &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, to which it will obviously be compared to, the author balances the story with historic and scientific background information.  The combination works very well, informing the reader with fascinating  tidbits while leaving him or her gripped in the thralls of a great  tale.<br />This is the story of the whaleship Essex, out of Nantucket on a two  year voyage to the Pacific in search of the early nineteenth century's  liquid gold, whale oil.  The unthinkable happens.  A usually docile sperm  whale, although large enough to sink a wooden ship, does just that.  Rammed  twice by an 85 foot leviathan of the sea, the crew takes to three whale  boats while its ship is crushed and rendered useless.  The resulting ninety  day journey is a story of hope, discipline, tragic mistakes, and ever  present thirst and starvation which leads the men ever closer to having to  execute the &quot;law of the sea&quot; in order to survive.<br />Nathaniel  Philbrick weaves first person accounts from survivors, a concise history of  Nantucket and the work of catching and rendering whales as well as the  physiology of the giant sea mammels and starvation into a first rate book.  I read this over three days -- it moves very quickly.  The author has a  talent for fleshing out his common whalemen so that they are interesting  and distinct characters without sacrificing authenticity and fact.<br />If you  liked &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; or Jon Krakauer's &quot;Into Thin  Air,&quot; you'll find &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; very much in the  same vein.  A story of people under terrible physical and mental assault  which the reader could not imagine enduring, coupled with a superbly  explained telling of the issues at hand that is well set in its place and  time.<br />Highly recommended -- you may want to finish this one all at once.	2000-06-26

The War of 1812, which the Battle of New Orleans ended convincingly (allowing the previously negotiated Treaty of Ghent to be accepted by both the British and our side  as negotiated), has had too few treatments in recent years.<br />Yet the  Battle of New Orleans, as the author argues, perhaps was the event that  convinced hostile Europeans that America was here to stay as a free nation.  I would not completely agree with Remini's contention that the Battle of  New Orleans was America's first major victory over European arms (he  dismisses Yorktown and Saratoga as mere surrenders doing in my opinion a  disservice to the aggressive American commanders and troops who did fight  and convincingly beat the British at Saratoga).  The author makes a case  that this neglected Battle of a forgotten war earned our country the  grudging respect  it would need to grow unmolested over the next few  decades.<br />That having been said, the book is a very well written account  of a stirring and fascinating story.  General Andrew Jackson, after  defeating the Creek Indians and punishing Spanish Florida for aiding that  foe as well as the British, leads his American volunteers to Louisianna to  defend against the expected British move on New Orleans.<br />The British  proceed to the bayous of the Mississippi delta and engage in another  European style campaign against wiley American back country fighters.  One  wonders why the English high command did not learn the lessons of Gen.  Braddock's defeat in the French and Indian War or numerous defeats during  the American Revolution.  Doctrinaire plans and rigid troop handling along  the lines of European war were not very successful against citizen soldiers  who know how to use their weapons with skill and fight from behind  cover.<br />Using first person sources to illustrate the events in December  1814 to January of 1815, Remini gives voice to the events and people who  helped make New Orleans a stirring American victory.  Unsurprisingly, this  biographer of Jackson paints a good portrait of the man whose talents and  traits were sorely needed by our side in facing British regiments who had  recently faced down Napolean's best troops.  The hodge-podge of defenders  are given colorful treatment. The pirate Laffite brothers and their outlaw  band who manned our artillery, backwoodsmen in buckskin (giving the name  the British used for our troops -- 'dirty shirts'), freed blacks, Creols  and New Orleans first citizens all manned the barracades to await the  onslaught.<br />The British, with their straight ahead determination, poor  avenue of attack and lack of planning aided the American cause.  But  Jackson earned much of the glory that surrounded his victory.  He cajoled  troops and supplies, built a well fortified line, attacked before the  British were all up and ready and worked to keep together an army that in  reality was more like today's UN peacekeeping forces than a coherent  American corps.<br />The battle scenes are well told, particularly the Jan.  8th main assualt in front of New Orleans.  Remini's writing is good enough  that the unfamiliar (to most) details of an unknown battlefield come alive  in the reader's mind.  So do the personalities on both sides.  His  descriptions are aided by three very good maps that allow one to fully  picture the terrain.<br />This book is a quick read.  The author tells just  enough of the main charactors to separate them from one another in the  story without bogging it down with a lot of background.  The battles  themselves come alive and are given a full description and dramatic  rendering.  You'll enjoy this book.make New Orleans a stirring American victory.

Margaret Leech's &quot;Reveille in Washington&quot; is a fact filled book that betray's her origins as a novelist.<br />For the Civil War afficianodo, there are many tidbits that add to one's understanding of the Civil War as  viewed from Washington, D.C.  These involve fascinating interactions among  the players (Lincoln, members of the Senate, Stanton, Seward and Chase),  and also reminders that even in the midst of war, Washington still minded  the habits and customs of society in our nation's capital.  Lincoln still  had (as the first host) parties, endured the countless details of  administration and grinding demands of petitioners, and found time for  levity and respit.<br />Like its counterpoint &quot;Ashes of Glory,&quot; an  excellent account of wartime Richmond, Reveille in Washington will broaden  the understanding of those of us who have waded through countless military  oriented books of the Civil War. Ms. Leech also includes a helpful timeline  and an excellent appendix on scores of the characters in her book.  For  those who often wonder &quot;what happened after...&quot; to historical  personages, the appendix will satisfy by tying up a lot of loose ends.  More history books should follow this habit.<br />My only slight criticism is  Ms. Leech's overuse of adjectives.  She describes every person and proper  noun, sometimes to the point of distraction like a florid romance novel.  This both helps and hinders the tale.  While it makes the events and  persons more imaginable to the mind's eye, she undoubtedly takes some  literary license in describing thoughts, feelings and descriptions that can  only be surmised.  All in all it is not a major distraction, but does  sometimes become tiresome.<br />That having been said, this portrait of  Washington fills the gaps to a great story. Not only are the principals  covered, but ordinary people, nurses, city jailers, prostitutes, hucksters  and regular folk are given their due in this fascinating book that at times  throbs with the pulse of a City that struggles to accomodate a war often at  its borders and its need to reflect it's own normalcy and image as a first  city in the midst of the great distraction outside it's gates.<br />An  enjoyable read.times  throbs with the pulse of a City that struggles to accomodate a war often at  its borders and its need to reflect it's own normalcy and image as a first  city in the midst of the great distraction outside it's gates.<br />An  enjoyable read.	2000-06-05

Drawing on a wide range of first person accounts, the author does an excellent job of giving civil war era Richmond rhythm and life.

The author weaves this always  interesting life of a city under seige and pregnant with the hope of a new  history into a fascinating story.  Not only are the thoughts and  recollections of the history makers used (Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee,  Govs. Lascher and Smith), but also the wartime experiences of junior  officers, clerks, business people, spys, prostitutes and other everyday  folk.<br />This book is an interesting tale of people coping with an  impossible situation that progresses from overwhelming to calamitous over  the course of the war.

His  novelizatioin of their thoughts and words serve to flesh out the history --  at no point do they overwhelm it.

I particularly enjoyed his treatment of Gen.  Hancock.  The dialog is believable and his characters never seem out of  character to those familiar with the historical accounts of the same  men.<br />It's an interesting book that gets beyond the history of the early  Civil War. It lets the reader feel that they are witness to a plausible  behind the scenes treatment of men compelled and called upon to do terrible  things in support of their vision of America.<br />I would rate this a notch  below &quot;The Killer Angles.&quot;  That was such a superb book in my  mind that the son's book still merits mention as a very enjoyable read.	2000-05-22

A common thread  runs through all those roles:  Nathan Bedford Forrest's willingness to do  whatever it took to achieve his goal and a ferocious ability to focus on  that course of action without regard to any distractions  -- including  morality or humanity.<br />Forrests genius for battle is explained in detail.  His ability to organize men, motivate them and then use them as an  instrument for war was surpassed by few in our Civil War (and perhaps by  none when considering brigade and division sized engagements).  That a man  unschooled in war could possess such an innate grasp of the success factors  required to win battles lends credence to the thought that successful  leaders are born rather than made (as does George McCllelan's ineptness on  the battlefied -- from a man who was overschooled in the art of war).  Forrest also accomplished his remarkable record (winning outright almost  all of his engagements) often with inferior forces.  His maxims &quot;get  their first with the most&quot; and &quot;war means fighting and fighting  means killing&quot; summarize the focus that guided his war making  philosophy.  Certainly a product of his times, his pre war life as a slave  trader and post war role as KKK founder also reflect his singlemindedness.  A man without means, he was determined to create wealth and position for  himself and his family -- an no route offerred a more certain path to  success than that of the slaver in the antebellum South. Even though the  southern aristocracy looked down on men who actually dealt in the flesh  they required to live their idle lives. After the war, he was perhaps (the  sources are sketchy) a founder and national leader of the KKK -- at a time  when his refusal to lead that organization could have led to a more  temperate and prosperous South for both white and black.<br />Nathan Bedford  Forrest attacked life -- in whatever role he was playing.  This book is an  interesting look at the makeup of a man who was willing to do anything and  everything required and who possessed supreme self confidence.<br />Most of  the book focuses on Forrest's war years, as one would expect.  The battle  accounts are thrilling as the reader is able to view a general commanding  with the audacity and tenacity possessed by few if any of his peers.  As  fascinating are the details of one of the South's most successful slave  trading organizations as well as the peek at the founding and early life of  the KKK that the book offers.<br />Although more maps would have been helpful  in explaining Forrest's war years, this is my only complaint.  The book is  worth the read.<br />Recommended.his refusal to lead that organization could have led to a more  temperate and prosperous South for both white and black.<br />Nathan Bedford  Forrest attacked life -- in whatever role he was playing.

Congenial, warm and partisan, O'Neill was a master of the  inside game of politics.  This book describes his rise in the rough and  tumble world of Bay State politics and his battles in the House that  successfully elevated him to Speaker (With a little help from Dan  Rostenkowski, who embarrassed Carl Albert at the 68 Dem. convention on the  orders of Pres. Johnson).  People liked O'Neill without always liking where  he wanted to take the country. Even he and President Reagan liked and joked  with each other while they were locked in mortal political battle over  redirecting the United States government.<br />O'Neill is likeable  in this  book -- the book is likeable,  also.	2000-05-15

McDonald has written an extremely well researched book about Alexander Hamilton, the man who arguably did more to set the American  government in motion than any of the other founders.  Not only thorougly  written, but the author weaves the events of Hamilton's most interesting  and significant life into a very readible book.  The author is a first  class biographer and writer.<br />Although George Washington has been  described as the &quot;indispensible man&quot; of the Revolution, the title  &quot;indispensible man of the first administration&quot; rightly belongs  to Hamilton.  He faced major issues that would define how the government  operated and whether or not our fledgling nation would rest upon a sound  financial system.<br />Hamilton succeeded brilliantly.  Against long odds, he  dealt with the assumption issue (state debts incurred during the  revolution), coinage, taxation and the establishment of the nation's  credit.  This was after effective adminstrative service during the  Revolution as Washington's aid (as well as other important posts such as  leading the storming of Redoubt No. 10 at Yorktown), writing the Federalist  Papers with Madison and Jay, and pushing the ratification of the  Constitution through a reluctant New York General Assembly.<br />The book  also provides fascinating glimpses of political manuvering among the  founders.  Although brilliant when establishing our plan of government and  enshrining ideals into our framework of governance, they plotted and  schemed like the best Tammany Hall politicos.  Jefferson is shown to be an  idealist even in dealing with current issues.  Monroe arguably commits  treason when revealing confidential information of President Washington to  sympathizers of the French Directorate in order to gain them advantage over  the Administration.  Madison, so noble in structuring the Constitution, is  shown as one of the ablist congressional gamesmen ever to have  played.<br />These are not necessarily criticisms of the founders.  While they  rightly hold their reputations for having created our Constitutional  govenrment, the portrait of their workings within the system -- buffetted  by parochial interests, vanity, ambition and all of the other factors at  play on public officials, makes them more human and  accessible.<br />Throughout all, Hamilton is a steadying influence on events.  Guided by the principals of establishing a system of administration and  government that will constrain the bad habits of public men and force their  ambitions to work toward the public good, as well his overriding drive to  put the nation on sound financial footing, Hamilton is revealed as the  keystone of the early Federalist period.  Without his steadfastness and  talents, it is possible that our ideals may have only been words on a paper  labled &quot;Constitution&quot; as a backward nation wallowed in debt and  succumbed to the machinations of forces from within and without who would  use the United States for their own purposes.<br />Great book about a Great  man.congressional gamesmen ever to have  played.<br />These are not necessarily criticisms of the founders.

Unfortunatly, it does not cover much of the rest of the &quot;Expansion&quot; story of the US as the title suggests.<br />The book is  breezy, with interesting facts and stories.  The author likes describing  the personalities of those who make his history, but one suspects he takes  a lot of &quot;writer's license&quot; with personality traits / reactions  he probably does not have any sources for.<br />The book is best when shedding  light on little known conflicts such as the Barbary War and the War of  1812.  Also interesting, are the &quot;early&quot; indian wars of the south  and midwest.  These conflicts have long receeded into American Memory and  it is difficult to find much describing what were at their times major  influences on our policy and history.<br />The book is interesting the way a  long magazine article is.  You keep reading because it is an interesting  story, but realize that there are gaps that if filled, would more  completely tell the tale.<br />The author probably makes a good deal of  inference about motives and states of mind with many of the sagas.<br />Ok,  not great.  Quick Read.	2000-05-15

Well Researched and Argued	Sears presents an interesting series of portrats relating to commanders and issues that all to freqeuntly dominated the Army of the Potomac and often stood in the way of effective prosecution of the war in the Eastern  Theater.<br />This book is well researched and effectively argued.  Fans of  Sear's Civil War works (of which I am one) will recognize many of the  vignettes from works such as &quot;Chancellorsville,&quot; &quot;Landscape  Turned Red,&quot; and &quot;The Peninsula Campaign.&quot;  They are more  fully fleshed out in this book, but essentially contain the same  information Sears has argued before.<br />However, this does not detract and  the Sears reader will find other stories that contain new information and  interesting portraits.<br />Gen. McClellan infuses most of the tales, his  presence is never far and these different affairs demonstrate how much  better &quot;Little Mac&quot; was at dominating the political life of the  Army than the Confederates.  Sears makes a compelling argument that the  hapless General was excellent at everything except fighting.  It begs the  question as to whether or not his talents could have been more effectively  employed had he gotten Halleck's job early on and field generalship been  left to Meade, Hooker or Grant (although whether or not McClellan's ego or  Lincoln's needs would have been satisfied by such an arrangement is in  doubt).<br />In particular, the revolt of the generals, although covered  somewhat in &quot;Chancellorsville,&quot; is a good work and telling as to  why the Army of the Potomac suffered such weak leadership at crucial times.  The chapters on the General Stone affair reveal the downside of political  expediency during the Civil War (and the willingness of McClellan to  sacrifice is friends and colleagues -- as in Stone's case and Porter's  court martial -- to further his prospects.)<br />Interestingly, the most  striking analysis regards the generalship of Gen. Hooker.  Although again,  &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; covers this ground, Sear's original research  and painstaking reconstruction of the events relating to Hooker's failure  during that battle are convincing in their defense against what appears in  hindsight to be the scapgoating of one of the few Union generals in the  East who would and could fight.  Sear's analysis is at odds with that of  many Civil War chroniclers including Ken Burns, Shelby Foote and James  McPherson regarding Hooker's failure during the height of the battle.  After taking in the evidence, I'd say that Sears has it right.<br />The  chapters are well organized, well documented and the writing succint.  This  form makes for excellent &quot;pick-up&quot; reading as it is not one story  but a series of portraits.

It was a favorite in our house when our two oldest were two and three years old.<br />The story is simple, but conveys a message of love and caring between parent and child that young children really relate to.<br />Having said that, the story is written in a style that  reflects poor pronunciation and word usage (&quot;dat&quot; for  &quot;that&quot;).  I found myself having to substitute correct  pronunciation and sentence structure for the actual words.  Children at the  age to whom the book is targeted may think the story as written reflects  correct word usage -- they are very impressionable at two and three!<br />But  for the writing style, I would have given it more stars.	2000-04-25

The tales are also a wonderful  introduction to the story of our country through our history and myths.  They cover the range of the American Experience and are exactly the kind of  tales that can serve as a launching pad to introduce youngsters to a wider  exploration of our national heritage.<br />The stories themselves are well  written and captivating (though my four year old's attention wandered with  some -- it is for older than pre-school on the whole).  The illustrations  are first rate and help younger children understand the written  story.<br />The format is perfect for bedtime stories -- good length for a one  story a night reading.

The author is attempting to do the same thing Tony Horwitz did with &quot;Confederates in the Attic&quot;.  He fails.<br />Where Horwitz used a journey through the old Confederacy to  explore the grip of the Civil War on today's South (in a very poingnant and  witty way), O'Shea uses his trip to to display gratuitous vocabulary,  overwritten place and setting descriptions and his world view on topics  that sometimes pop into his head.  Most annoying are his swipes at his  personal collection of people and places that obviously fail to embrace his  world view (such as a slap at Lynchburg, VA that appears, unconnected in  the middle of one passage).  His excesses are distracting -- in short the  author inserts much too much of himself in a book that would have been  better if it had focused more on what the front is like today and what  impact  it still had on those who live along it.<br />Some interesting  historic nuggets and vingettes do appear in the book and they are sometimes  fascinating. The Great War still has the power to move with its farce and  tradgedy.  The book should have focused more on this aspect.	2000-04-07

I liked all of the factoids and descriptions they gave about life one thousand years ago in England. Fascinating to see how our ancestors did it (life) facing  challenges we have long ago conquored. The organization of the book tends  to break up the narrative. It is mildly annoying in places, as are  comparisons to current news that will, unfortunately quickly make this book  look dated. This situation is caused by the author's using a period  calendar as a backdrop to their story and organizing the book around the  twelve months of the year and the seasonal activities of the Anglo-Saxons  under study.<br />A quick read and overall enjoyable.	2000-03-02

Maybe that is because it was produced as a serialized novel originally. It can have that &quot;find out what our heros are up to next issue&quot;  feel. Overall it is fast paced, but long. I liked the action sequences and  the author's creation of distinct personalities for his heros. While I had  to read this over a long period of time, I found I enjoyed it most when I  could put in a couple of hours at a time and fully submerge myself in the  author's world. I would recommend picking this up for a vacation book or if  you know you'll be able to keep at it night after night.<br />The author uses  a convincing historical and period backdrop for his tale. It feels real  which aids the story. The romantic nature of his heros leads to a wonderful  story of comradship and loyalty, good versus evil, etc. Many things to  like, but I did not find it deserves quite as lofty a pedestal as most of  these other reviewers do.	2000-03-02

In between lie the fathers  (all men) of mathamatical understanding.  These individuals are the story  of AGAINST THE GODS.  Bernstein survey's the intellectual contrubutions of  each as man strives to understood basic probability, the law of large  numbers, bell curves, regression analysis, uncertainty theory and  everything else you dimly remember from college statistics classes.  He  spends the latter quarter of the book on risk and probability theory in the  financial world, where theorists have developed portfolio analysis,  volitility studies, hedging and sidebets and other  quantatative market  plays.<br />Credit to the author for balancing his story against the very high  probability that much of what these thinkers sought may be unattainable.  He frequently mentions the humanity that these people try to explain with  laws formulated from observations in the natural world.  Although rightly  impressed with his intellectual frontiersmen, Bernstein has no problem  recognizing that the uncertainty that has always eluded explanation is us  and that it helps make life worth living and progress possible.<br />This book  is interesting for what it is.  A story of the development of theories.  I  would have enjoyed more of a focus on the applications of this intellectual  progression that led to the development of insurance and financial markets.  Though these elements are mentioned often, they provide the backdrop for  Bernsteins survey of theory.  I suspect another book awaits someone who  will reverse the order and use theory as a backdrop for  the mechanisms  that have allowed the modern economy to flourish and develop.  The story of  insurance, speculation, the beginning of capital markets, a monied economy  and the like spring from the intellectual movements so well chronicled by  Bernstein.  However, they are not the focus, which has the habit of making  the reading dry and sometimes uninteresting to those not captivated by the  actual numeric analyses and proofs which are amply offerred over the course  of the book.<br />If you like intellectual history and are looking to tie the  building blocks of probability and risk analysis together over the last  four centuries than this book may well captivate you.  If you are seeking  an understanding of how these discoveries were applied to forge the modern  economy we now take for granted you will find parts interesting but may  well feel that the story is incomplete.a monied economy  and the like spring from the intellectual movements so well chronicled by  Bernstein.

Mr. Kaltman's book lessons and examples are almost entirely taken from that source.<br /> Some of the several hundred management lessons the author extracts from Grant's masterpiece provide interesting insight. Many are, however, superficial, obvious or an outright stretch. I found some that drew lessons belied by a deeper and fuller knowledge of the historic example of Grant from which the author sought to extract his &quot;evidence.&quot;<br /> Actually, my impression was that this book would be more useful to a young reader who had a cursory knowledge of history and was looking for a framework for decision making.<br /> For serious managers, I suggest reading Grant's Personal Memoirs.

For almost any reader, you'll find a well written portrait of those you know and be introduced to those who history has not favored with as much coverage as they deserve.<br />These thoroughly American personalities  are the story of our Revolution.  Anyone who doubts the &quot;Great  Man&quot; theory of history will be hard pressed to counter the argument  that but for the stout hearts and devoted souls who grace the pages of  PATRIOTS our struggle for independence may not have come off.<br />The tale of  these heroes is majesticly told by the author.  Not a chronology of the  war, but a portrait of the mind and spirit of the revolution as reflected  in those who risked all to wage and win it.  This is a great book that will  fill you with pride and wonderment and hopefully thankfulness for those  brave enough to bring forth the American nation.	2000-02-04

The first person perspective of a bitter  and lonely billionaire who plots his revenge on his children even as he has  plotted his own death is riviting.<br />When the story moves to inland Brazil,  Grisham's narrative excels at explaining a remote yet beautiful land that  few are aware exists.  His characters likewise are well developed and  beleivable in their roles.  His portrayal of the several amoral lawyers  borders on the hilarious and will serve to confirm many people's  stereotypes of members of the bar.<br />What separates this novel from othe  works of Grisham is the presence of God in the life of several of the  characters.  Religion is a positive influence on those it touches in the  story and serves as the fulcrum upon which the plot turns.<br />This is the  first fiction book I can recall reading where the strong faith of several  major characters is treated as a positive defining aspect of their lives.  In my experience, when I have encountered religion at all in fiction, it  usually is presented as a character defect or held up to demonstrate the  hypocrisy of those who do not practice what they preach.  Grisham's  treatment of faith as a central aspect of character and motivational force  is refreshing and  much more representative of how it affects most  religious people.<br />I read the book quickly over several days.  Great  opening, well developed and interesting characters, enough greed and money  on the line to titilate and a good juxtaposition of faith and redemption.  A winner.	2000-02-03

Most of us have some idea that the western frontier could be a violent place from movies and stories read in our youth.  But very few know of any of the real  escapades that helped generate the material for the likes of Zane Gray,  John Wayne or Clint Eastwood.  Mr. Utley's book chronicles one of the most  infamous episodes of western violence, the Lincoln County Range War.<br />This  book is well researched and introduces many charactors (Lew Wallace, Pat  Garrett, Billy the Kid and John Henry Tunstall to name a few).  It is a  solid chronology of the disputes and charactors that made Lincoln County a  lawless, murderous place for a few years in the late 1870's.  Warning for  those expecting someone to be wearing a white hat in this tale, there is no  romance in this telling of the old west.	2000-01-31

Unlike many  treatments of Nixon, he balances the story and successfully lets the events and recollections portray both men's strengths and weaknesses.  On the whole, Nixon comes off better, though still fatally flawed, and Kennedy  comes off worse, though every bit as charasmatic, as usually thought of in  the public mind.<br />This book could have used better editing.  Some  sentences contain gramatical mistakes and there are more than a few minor  misstatements.  This does not detract from a very interesting book.<br />Political junkies will enjoy the hardball tactics and strategies both  Nixon and Kennedy employed.  History fans will appreciate the back door  view of two of the larger figures in recent American history.	2000-01-26

For TR devotees, they will find this book a summary  focusing on the last ten years of his life.  It is a time when TR, still  vigorous, is launching his children into the larger world and beginning to  focus on their efforts and activities to shoulder the family's unique  burden of service to the country.<br />The book takes this period and  investigates how TR's larger than life example to and relationships with  his four sons shaped their destinies, most immediately by their preparation  for and service during World War I.<br />TR molded the family in his image.  His code is their code as they constantly are movtivated by living up to  his ideals and frequently take action according to what father would do.  This is a portrait of a strong family, wedded to a single world and life  view, abiding by commonly held standards that they all internalized and  lived by.<br />This portrait of the family as the core of the Roosevelt  existence is touching and provides a good study of the fountain from which  TR drank constantly to replenish his soul and steel himself for the public  battles that define the statesman.<br />I would have liked to have had more of  a focus on how TR built the family.  It would have been interesting to know  more of their childhoods -- much the way Edmund Morris plumbed TR's own  childhood experiences in &quot;The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt&quot; -- to  better understand how this family developed into the close knit reflection  of TR's will.<br />But it is a relatively short book and does an intersting  job on the material it covers.  You get a good feel for the Roosevelt  family bonds during the period of their children's young adulthoods against  the backdrop of the war in Europe and TR's tireless campaigns to shape  America as he saw it should be.hape  America as he saw it should be.	2000-01-22

The fact that they are  writing about still classified events means Blind Man's Bluff lacks a  central story line or continuous chronology.  The authors could only relate  those events that participants chose to disclose and describe.  Thus, the  book is very episodic as oppossed to being a neat history of the  subject.<br />That being said, the stories are fascinating and moving.  Thank  a submariner the next time you run into one.  These men risked (and still  risk) a cold and silent demise in pursuit of their missions -- missions  that contributed greatly to ensuring that the Soviets would not be tempted  to go nuclear during the cold war due to our constant ability to keep ahead  of their technology, strategy and tactics and general war fighting  ability.<br />The stories are thrill rides of missions in Soviet waters,  collissions between U.S. and Soviet subs, the loss of both Russian and  American boats (with all hands), and close to shore cable tapping by our  navy that is as breathtaking as anything Tom Clancy could dream up.<br />The  authors do sometimes go overboard in their &quot;breathless&quot; writing  as some of the other viewers write, but I found this only a minor  annoyance.  The stories of the men and machines themselves are the focus  and the authors write them well.<br />(The only thing that nagged me through  the book was the realization that so many of our naval personnel were  willing to talk about events that they swore never to reveal.  The authors  do not spend much time on this issue.  My hope is that the Navy has given  the quiet ok to these veterans as a way of acknowledging their historic  service.  The alternative is that a large number of sworn men broke their  commitment and may be making it more difficult for current submariners to  perform their necessary missions.)<br />This is fast paced, exciting and will  stir your pride in our country's armed forces.and may be making it more difficult for current submariners to  perform their necessary missions.)<br />This is fast paced, exciting and will  stir your pride in our country's armed forces.	2000-01-14

Keeping with traditon, Santa selects one boy to  present the first present of Christmas to before he mounts to the sky to  visit all the homes of good boys and girls.  Rather than ask for a bike, or  Pokemon or any other &quot;big&quot; gift, the boy asks for one of Santa's  sleigh bells, proof he can hold onto that yes, Santa does exist.<br />This  tale of Christmas belief (in Santa, that is) works well on adults, too.  It  has a message about belief and wonderment that touch all who want to  believe in the magic associated with the gift giving part of  Christmas.<br />Warning, The Polar Express is best for children a little older  than mine (5 1/2, 4).  It introduces the concept that Santa may not exist.  I get around this by not reading two paragraphs in the book, but you should  be forwarned if that particular discussion in your household is several  years away.  (My kids also tell me everytime that the boy in the story  should not get on the train at the invitation of a stranger.)  At the right  age, this is a magical and wonderful Christmas tale of belief.	2000-01-09

It is breezy and topical, not detailed or exhaustive.  But it does its job well.<br />Mr. Dana had a uniqe perspective on the Civil War.  First enlisted to go &quot;out West&quot; and check out  &quot;this General Grant&quot; by Edwin Stanton, Dana soon became a trusted  advisor to both the President and the Secretary of War.  He apparently  spent most of his war service in the field, at the side of various union  generals so that Washington would have a trusted and immediate voice to  report on what was really happening on the various fronts.  His advice  helped advance officers Dana thought effective and cashire those whose  service was detrimental to the cause of the Union. His advice and counsel  was also influential on various war policy issues.<br />One belives that Dana  had much to do in helping Grant, Sherman and others overcome their  reputations and distance from Washington to reach their appointed places  from where Union success ultimately sprung.  He is a concise writer and  offers strong opinions on personalities associated with the Union's  management and prosecution of the war.  These are interesting because Dana  is often quoted in more recent books on the war.  His story helps show why  these quotes are meaningful as well as tells an interesting tale of an  individual who can best be described as the highest ranking civilian in the  field from 1863-1865.<br />An interesting book from a unique vantage point.	2000-01-05

His service saw the front lines of every major battle including Shiloh, Chickamagua, Chattanooga, Atlanta, Franklin and  Nashville. Amazingly, this rebel came through intact and lived to vividly  record his experiences.<br />This book is much more impressionistic than a  historic telling of the facts (which Watkins reminds the reader  frequently).  It lays bare the attitude of a rebel private (although one  suspects Watkins is much more literate and sophistocated than many of his  fellows in the ranks) who endured starvation, forced marches, punishing  battles and the monotony and arbitrary nature of camp life while serving a  losing cause.<br />Watkins does an excellent job of letting the reader into  his head.  He reveals well the base existence and actions of ordinary  soldiers who paid for the drama of the Civil War with their youth, blood  and life.	2000-01-03

They believe the Hillary Clinton health care plan should have been enacted and present their study from this point of view.  Their slant is annoying. However, it ultimately does not detract too much  from a very able telling of the conceptualization, selling, manuevering and  strategy employed by both sides over the struggle to socialize medicine in  the United States.<br />Although never pretty or highminded as we are taught  in civics class, the book shows a democratic (small &quot;d&quot;) system  at work.  Both sides had true believers who were guided by philosophy and  were trying to do what was &quot;right.&quot;  Both sides had craven  opportunists driven by darker more mercurial instincts.  The American  Congress worked to examine the issue and resolve the dispute as the framers  had intended:  by providing a forum for parties on both sides of the debate  to hash out their perspectives and come to a resolution (one must always  keep in mind that an equally legitimate action of any legislative body is  to say no to proposals that are unwise or do not have sufficient political  support.)<br />This book will educate the average citizen and fascinate the  political junkie.	1999-12-30

It portrays the progression of our &quot;peculiar institution&quot; from earliest colonial times up through Reconstruction.  The Author focuses on the changing nature  of the relationship between slave and master, the role of religion as both  a tool and dilemma for the slave system (and as a primary cultural marker  for slaves) and the evolving debate undergirding the defense of slavery and  the unique nature of the Antibellum South.<br />The book also delves,  sparringly, into slave life and experiences.<br />It is a little dry in places  and the writing style at times reads like an academic journal.  I would  have preferred more anacdotes to buttress some of the claims made by the  author, if nothing else to make the book more interesting.  However, in  many places he does make use of statistics to reinforce his conclusions,  which adds weight to the arguments presented in the book.<br />Overall, a good  overview and introduction to slavery as it existed in the United States	1999-12-28

All the more captivating because it is true (except for Junger's recreation of the ship's foundering and crew's drowning -- necessary since none survived).<br />This book has several great elements.  A  depressed community tied to a commodity industry (fishing). A historic and  proud way of economic life. The adventure of the open sea. And, lastly,  the indomitable ability of nature to remind man that all of our prideful  accomplishments pale before her brute force.<br />The story of the fishing  industry is wonderfully rich, both in its historic development and present  day practice.  The book captures the gritty and raw feel for a very tough  way of life.<br />But Junger's success comes with his discription of the  terrible Nor'easter that carried away the Andrea Gail, a modern fishing  vessel trapped 500 miles from shore during what has been called the storm  of the century.  His writing is so immediate that the reader actually fears  what water, wind and weather can do when unleashed in a perfect  storm.<br />You won't be able to put this down.	1999-12-23

It is a journey into the psyche of a young  man who, with seemingly all of the advantages that late Twentiety Century  America can arm one with, decides to disappear into the flotsam of the  country playing the part of an enlightened hobo (he takes the moniker  'supertramp' as a way to christen his new identity).<br />The reader will  continually wonder &quot;why&quot; and it is difficult not to blame the  supertramp for the fate that awaits him.<br />Still, the book provides an  interesting look at Americans and American life not usually written about.  I found the stories of the supertramps friends and companions, and how they  went about living as interesting as the subject's story.<br />The final few  chapters dealing with the young man's final foray into the Alaskan  wilderness are particularly intersting.  It is tough though, to be  sympathetic to one who ignores all of the warning signs of danger and  refuses to make any moves that serve his long-term interests (being simple  survival).  The reader becomes aware that he is watching what could be  described as a protracted suicide disguised as noble adventure in the mind  of the supertramp.<br />This is a combined tale of adventure and folly.  Interesting, but a very different adventure than presented in Krakauer's  previous book &quot;Into Thin Air.&quot;	1999-12-23

Everest expedition that cost the lives of several experienced mountaineers and their paying customers is a dramatic story told very well.<br />I don't know  much about mountaineering, or the sub-culture of adventurers who pursue  personal highs through scaling the peaks of the world.  The book makes a  fine introduction of both topics as background for the actual Everest  expedition.<br />Its strenght lies, of course, in the telling of the fateful  trek up ths world's highest mountain.  The description of the deprivation,  physical pain and mental strain that greets almost all high altitude  mountaineers does make for an enthralling tale (It also made me wonder who  in his right mind would want to undertake such a venture).<br />This book is  more about tradgedy than triumph.  Although some of the participants have  heroic moments, the fact that supreme ego as well as commercial pressure  drove many to undertake unwise risks that resulted in death left this  reader wondering &quot;why&quot; by the end of this fascinating book.<br />A  very fine read you won't want to put down.	1999-12-23

Maybe that is because it was produced as a serialized novel originally. It can have that &quot;find out  what our heros are up to next issue&quot;  feel.<br /> Overall it is fast paced, but long. I liked the action sequences  and the author's creation of distinct personalities for his heros. While I  had to read this over a long period  of time, I found I enjoyed it most  when I could put in a couple of hours at a time and fully submerge myself  in the author's world. I would recommend picking this up for  a vacation  book or if you know you'll be able to keep at it night after night.<br /> The  author uses a convincing historical and period backdrop for his tale. It  feels real which aids the story. The romantic nature of his heros leads to  a wonderful story of  comradship and loyalty, good versus evil, etc. Many  things to like, but I did not find it deserves quite as lofty a pedestal as  most of these other reviewers do.	1999-12-22

Good enough that I plan to pick up another of the O'Brien series in the future.<br />The author tells a good story.  Aubrey and Maturin (the main characters) are well developed.  They  are also complex enough that they are believable as real people, a triumph  for any novelist.  Plus, the historical detail and setting will entice any  reader who likes period pieces.<br />Not being a sailor, I found the author's  explanations of naval terms and tools educational.  I learned from the  book.  The information is presented in enough detail to enlighten and  explain the story but not so much as to bore or bog down the action.  Again, the mark of a good author.<br />Recommended.	1999-12-22

Miller captures the frentic energy and optimism of the president who could be called the living embodiment of the American ideal.<br />Theodore Roosevelt's life story is a great study in the art of living life fully.  For young people particularly, Roosevelt's example can be a valuable lesson  highlighting the benefits of taking risks, seizing the initiative, being  true to one's beliefs and taking charge of molding one's personna.  Simply  put, TR's life shows why a can-do attitude has the chance to produce  success when applied consistently to life's challenges and  opportunities.<br />TR's incredible rise and success in public life (as well  as family, literary and outdoor life) is due much more to his constatly  being in a state of forward motion rather than the execution of any long  term plans.  This very practical man combined this trait with several  extraordinary gifts and a charasmatic personality to will himself on the  American people over a thirty year period.  It is a remarkable story<br />All  of these facts need an able story teller. Theodore Roosevelt has found one  in Nathan Miller.  Richly researched, the author weaves facts with well  reasoned commentary to produce an easily read tome.  This is a fun book to  read.  It is fast paced and thoroughly interesting.  In Miller's hands,  TR's lively personality leaps from the page and enthuses the reader.	1999-12-21

Truman was a much simplier man (a la Reagan)  who knew where he stood, knew right from wrong and accepted the  responsibility that runs with great office.<br />This book captivates in part  because there are many less ambiguities to Truman's life than seem to  present themselves with other &quot;famous&quot; people.  The facts of  Truman's life story are interesting enough -- what sets this book apart is  that the author tells the story in a fast-paced and engaging manner.  He  synthesizes the facts with just enough analysis to weave together a  coherent book.  He aviods the trap that many biographers fall into of over  analysis -- letting Truman remain the story instead of having some  interpretation of Truman become the story.<br />Note:  I get to speak at a  number of Eagle Scout ceremonies and mention this book along with Morris's  &quot;The Rise Of Theodore Roosevelt,&quot; as two inspiring books that can  open up young minds to the possibilities available in life.  Roosevelt for  shear energy and action and Truman for persistance in the face of  opposition.	1999-12-15

For a reader who is looking to understand the last crucial year of the war in the  East, where war really began to look more like what was to follow in 1914  and less like what Napolean had created, this book will satisfy on all  accounts.<br />His genius as a writer is his ability to combine the larger war  -- strategy, movement of armies, political objectives -- with the human  interest perspectives that make recent battle stories (Sears, et al) come  alive through first person accounts of sweat and toil in the line of  battle.<br />This ability produces very readible history.  Catton's works  reflect the great story which the tragic facts of the Civil War combined to  produce.	1999-12-13

I think this one rates about three and one-half stars.<br />This 1896 murder tale is gruesome and intelligent at the same time. The murder scene descriptions are grotesque, but do not seem  gratuitous in this tale of the search for a serial killer by an unusual  team of investigators. (Although I would not recommend the book for early  or mid-teenagers. This is a PG-17 novel). The investigators are a  psychologist (alienist), journalist, two police detectives and a woman.  This allows the author to explore psychology, the muckraking and reform  press, a police force transitioning from corrupt to professional methods  and the nascent woman's movement.<br />On the positive side, anyone  interested in historical fiction will be enthralled by the descriptions of  turn of the century New York. Historical figures abound, prominently police  commissioner Roosevelt (although he comes off as a bit cartoonish for  anyone who has read Roosevelt biographies). J.P Morgan and Anthony Comstock  also make appearances.<br />Mr. Carr does great justice to atmospherics. The  tenement houses reek in the imagination and New York's cold and wet  streetscape chills the reader thanks to very good descriptive writing.<br />Anyone interested in the founding of modern psychology will enjoy the  great debates that attended its birth. Psychological analysis is the  backbone for this murder investigation, as are &quot;new&quot; police  methods such as fingerprinting and handwriting analysis.<br />The story  itself is enjoyable, although for some reason it took me three tries to get  into this book. One reason is that Mr. Carr uses a lot of words to tell his  tale. No new noun is introduced without its background being explored or  appearance described. I thought at one point that had Mr. Carr's editors  banished the dash (--) and comma (,) from this book, the tale would have  remained but been told in about half the pages.<br />This makes for at times  a languid pace of reading. Fortunately, there are periodic surprises and  major plot developments to the murder investigation that generally keep  one's interest and generate enough anticipation that the reader wants to  find out &quot;who dun-it.&quot;id pace of reading.

I am sure almost every American knows this battle name, but few the battle.  In the author's hands, the miraculous stand of  American patriots against the King's finest is brought to life through  diary entries, absorbing detail and a  pace of writing that lends  appropriate drama and excitement to the entire exercise.  The author  continues to mine an exciting story that has produced the fine works  &quot;Saratoga&quot; and &quot;The Winter Soldiers.&quot;  I recommend both  of these, in addition to &quot;Decisive Day&quot; for an enjoyable foray  into our revolutionary struggle.	1999-12-01

You Can Feel the Fear	Priest has written a meticulous journal of America's bloodiest day of war from as seen from the eyes of those who earned that title for the Battle of Anteitam.<br />This book portrays the Civil War in all of its horror.  Glory  is left on the parade ground as those who witnessed and received the  anonymous carnage of the cannon, grape and cannister, as well as the more  intimate destruction of the infantry ball, tell of their experiences in  minute by minute accounts from around the battlefield.  The compellation  and writing is so good that the fear and horror of those waiting in the  ranks to charge or receive the attention of their enemies dominates the  book.<br />For anyone looking to read of what it was &quot;like&quot; in Civil  War battle, this book is about the best.<br />I would recommend that the  reader first take a standard account of the battle, such as Sears'  &quot;Landscape Turned Red.&quot;  Priest does not attempt to portray  strategy, the situation that led both armies to Anteitam or the macinations  of much of anyone above the rank of Colonel.  Not a criticism, since he is  not attempting to cover the whole battle, but it may leave the uninitiated  at a loss to understand why men are engaged in places like the East Woods,  Bloody Lane or Lower Bridge.	1999-11-29

It doesn't quite reach that level, but still is a captivating story.  The picture of lower class life in Eighteenth Century England is a  compelling backdrop for a good story.  The ending seemed a little too  fantastic (reminded me of a Robert Ludlum finish) in that all the loose  ends were brought to a successful conclusion for the star crossed lovers.  But on the whole, I would recommend this to any who have enjoyed Follett's  previous work.	1999-11-24

This is very engaging and at times is very much a page turner.  I was left thinking that a more detailed account of history  being made by the movers themselves may not exist.  The end of the Cold War  is a great story in and of itself, but also a story that could have had a  very different ending were it not for the team that managed to bring it to  a successful close.<br />This is a very honest book by honest men.  Evenly  though successful on all of the big issues, they write of miscues,  uncertainty and difficulties in reaching the &quot;right&quot; decision.  It is not a self-praise tome, but a book that is not afraid to lay out an  accurate rendering of the facts and atmosphere.  The reader has enough  information and background to put himself in the role of President and ask,  &quot;What would I have done in that siguation.&quot;  It's the mark of a  thorough book.<br />One can not help but come away impressed by the Bush  foreign policy apparatus and the President's own grasp of events, the  players and the vital interests of the United States.  He, aided by one of  the best foreign policy / national security teams ever assembled, played  America's hand superbly.<br />After reading this book, anyone who still  believes that any President's main responsibility is &quot;the economy,  stupid&quot; is.....well, stupid.	1999-10-23

Although you know the ending, the tale is constructed in a way that has you hoping someone will  make a move in the story to avoid the awful destiny that must unfold.<br />My  only quibble is that the author takes a lot of license with what the  various players were thinking.

The number of deaths,  amount of suffering and frequency of atrocities not only underscores the  costs of exploration and trade but provides an indelible backdrop to a  fascinating story.<br />The author tells this tale well.

Ketchum brings to life the  battles of Trenton and Princeton -  which arguably were the most timely and  important victories of the war.  What fascinates, and underscores the  pedestal we have built under Washington, is how much he shouldered the  burdens of the cause alone -- and how he made critical and bold decisions  that kept the flame of independence from burning out in the hearts of his  countrymen.<br />This is my second Ketchum book.  I read Saratoga this past  summer and also enjoyed it very much.  Readers who like &quot;Civil  War&quot; style writing with unit descriptions and first person sources  from the soldiers who fought won't be disappointed.  Read this book and  you'll come away with a love and appreciation of the greatness of George  Washington and an understanding of the heroic trials our forefathers  undertook earning our liberties and independence.	1999-03-08

I liked all of the factoids and descriptions they gave about life one thousand years ago  in England.  Fascinating to see how our ancestors did it (life) facing  challenges we have long ago conquored.<br />The organization of the book tends  to break up the narrative.  It is mildly annoying in places, as are  comparisons to current news that will, unfortunately quickly make this book  look dated.  This situation is caused by the author's using a period  calendar as a backdrop to their story and organizing the book around the  twelve months of the year and the seasonal activities of the Anglo-Saxons  under study.<br />A quick read and overall enjoyable.	1999-02-16

Waugh writes a very readable story about the political fight during the latter part of the civil war -- a story that is usually presented as a backdrop in civil war histories.  Even if you are well read on the war and  Lincoln's presidency, you'll learn all sorts of new and interesting  information that lead to a better understanding of America's indespensible  man during our nation's hour of need.<br />For example, most histories tend to  focus on newspaper editor Horace Greely as a proxie for Lincoln's  relationship with the press.  Waugh brings other much less well remembered  &quot;ink-slingers&quot; to light -- some more embitterred than Greely and  some who were strongly on the Lincoln team throughout -- to give a much  more coplex yet telling insight into the President's relationship with the  fourth estate.<br />The author also wonderfully display's Lincoln's  willingness to &quot;do what it took&quot; to ensure his political (and the  nation's) survival.  Lincoln the immortal is aptly remembered in memory as  the embodiment of American civic ideals.  Waugh's story illustrates Lincoln  the politician (and he was a master politician)conceiving strategy and  executing the machinations of politics that allowed him to be in a position  to stand atop history's pedestal.<br />The book itself is well written, never  boring with just the right mix of detail and story.  Waugh does an  excellent job of keeping the various players identified to the reader as  they pop in and out of the tale to play their parts.  I found this to be a  page turner.	1999-02-09

This is a fatal error for a battle whose places are unfamiliar  and whose units are unknown -- particularly the Japanese.  Reference maps  of the island and the progress of the campaign would have helped orient the  reader and clarified some of the story.<br />The author highlighted various  parts of the battle but left others under explored.

While significant  attention was given to some aspects of the campaign, other parts seemed to  receive a less thorough treatment.<br />This is minor, however.  The author  covers all facets:  the political situation, personalities, strategic  considerations as well as military.  Grants particular genius for winning  in his era of warfare is plumbed in detail.  An important addition to  literature on the western war, which is still overshadowed by focus on the  Virginia theater.<br />The book elicits several fascinating questions.  One  which struck me was how Grant, who was taking great strategic risks with  his army, still left actual battle fighting largely up to his subordinates  (as did many senior generals in the war).  He was a very cool and collected  general for one who bore the weight of the war on his shoulders.	1999-01-21

Anyone in a large corporation or the political world will recognize this  Machevellian climate where getting things done requires alliances with  those who may abandon you around the next bend in pursuit of their  objectives.

Gen. Chamberlain comes across most as a man of ideals and integrity.  His willingness to risk all living up to these character traits is inspiring:  first risking life and limb on the battlefield then opportunity and office in Maine politics.  The author's book is readable, well paced and engaging.  A further examination of Chamberlain's political career as governor would have nicely rounded out the story.  I imagine his dealings with the legislature and public would have further supported the author's demonstration of her subject's wartime personnae.

The human side of war.	Very well written. Ambrose tells an absorbing tale of what the war was like to men who fought it. I could not put it down.<br />This book is a good compliment to Ambrose's &quot;Citizen Soldiers.&quot; In that book, Ambrose takes a look at the condition of the G.I. in Europe as a whole. While offering interesting personal accounts, it is intended as a survey of all soldiers and as such is somewhat impersonal (although very good).<br />Band of Brothers, on the other hand, is intimate and personal. By following one command (E Co., 506 / 101st Airborne) across France and into Germany, we get to see a discrete group of soldiers adjust to changing conditions brought on by different seasons, terrain, offensive and defensive actions, their own increasing battle savvy and fatigue. I like this approach. By personalizing the experience of a few front-line soldiers, the impact on the reader is enhanced because one comes to know the characters. They are not just &quot;some soldiers who experienced frost bite,&quot; they are individuals we've come to know who looked with the pride of conquerors as they stood in Hitler's Eagle's Nest, a fitting end to their fatigue, loss and heroics in liberating a continent.<br />This outfit in particular offers lots of adventure, which is I am sure why Ambrose chose them. Part of the 101st Airborne, E Co., was at Utah Beach, the Battle of Arnhem, the Battle of the Bulge, helped liberate a concentration camp in addition to securing Hitler's Bavarian retreat.  As we get to know these Americans through their battles and experiences, we more fully appreciate how our &quot;regular guys&quot; helped conquer self-designed supermen bent on world domination.<br />This book moves very quickly, is highly entertaining and moving. Watch out, you may want to read this ground level WW II account in one sitting.	1998-02-11

Most importantly, his defense of the atomic mission is a necessary statement given it's condemnation by today's moral relativists.  Sweeney revisits the history, situation and even moral case which justified the dropping of the bomb.  My only hope is that those wading into the issue for the first time will have access to his (or similar) arguments so as to understand what time and hindsight have prooved to be a necessary mission.	1998-02-10

Bulger offers many valuable insights into the art of advancing issues and working with people in a political environment.  Aside from my collegial interest, the book is extremely well written, eloquently styled and full of anecdotes which serve to illustrate the author's points.  However, like almost all politicians I have become familiar with, I assume there are two or three really good chapters about his art that he was tempted to write but decided not to allowing for his current public position and desired legacy.  That being said, the book is insightful, honest and presents a good picture of inside politics by one who knew where he stood on most issues and understands the use of power.	1998-02-09

The treatment of the battle is exhaustive, but his account of the situation and movements before the battle make the Gettysburg story fresh again.  Knowing the before allows one to properly understand and judge July 1-3 1863 and its aftermath.  By the way, the Gettysburg park licensed guides say that this is the one book they consider the foundation of their knowledge and essential to passing their licensing exam.	1998-02-09

If you are at all interested in civil war writing, or great historical writing, read this three vol. set.  Although I spent all summer reading it, I plan to read it again at least once more.  Foote mentions that the civil war involved almost 10,000 individual engagements, I would imagine he mentioned most of those in his tome and gives in depth narrative and analytical treatment to all of the significant battles, decisions and strategic situations that defined the civil war period.  Believe it or not, its a great beach book. The writing is that good.	1998-02-09

McPherson shows why the narrative approach to writing history is far superior to the analysis of minutia that academic historians are putting out currently.  This is the best single volume of the Civil War.  If you read this first and then Shelby Foote's three volume treatment you will have read the very best in civil war writing.	1998-02-09

Groom the novelist shows in this quick read of a remarkable civil war story.  The details are present to please military history purists and the author's ability to weave an excellent story from the facts will make this enjoyable to the casual civil war reader.  Good beach or holiday book because you will not want to put it down.	1998-02-03

Longstreet.  A fine, well researched story of what has been relegated to the status of sideshow to the campaigns of General Grant in 1864.  Wert balances detail (unit citations down to regimental level) with discussions of strategies and the big picture pressures under which both commanders operated.  My greatest criticism is that the maps are simplistic and would have been more useful if they had been drawn to the same level of detail (regimental with better terrain markings) as the author uses in the text.  Overall, a good read for civil war buffs.	1998-02-03
