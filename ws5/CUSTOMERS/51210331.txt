Michael Connelly's \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is the author's first foray into the legal thriller genre.  He has already proven himself a master of the police procedural with his marvelous Harry Bosch series. This novel introduces California criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller, a man with two ex-wives and an eight-year-old daughter named Hayley.  Mickey is known as a sleazy lawyer who lives on the edge, barely managing to make ends meet by defending drug dealers, junkies, and an occasional accused murderer.<br /><br />To Mickey, \\"the law was not about truth.  It was about negotiation, amelioration, manipulation.\\"  It is a good day for Mickey when he gets a guilty client off on a technicality.  He enjoys punching holes in the prosecution's cases and the cops and district attorneys hate his guts.  Mickey's most deep-seated fear is one that he inherited from his father, who was a prominent lawyer for almost thirty years--the fear of failing to protect an innocent client from being sent to prison.<br /><br />Haller, who does much of his work out of his Lincoln Town Car, is now busier than ever.  He has a new client named Louis Roulet, who was arrested for aggravated assault and attempted rape, and the suspect's family is filthy rich.  When Roulet asks Haller to represent him, the lawyer immediately sees dollar signs dancing before his eyes.  This might be the big score, or as Mickey likes to say, \\"the gift that keeps on giving,\\" with legal fees that could climb well into the six figures.  Little does Mickey know that by taking this case, he will be jeopardizing his career as well as his life. The unexpected fallout will change the way that Mickey views himself and the law forever.<br /><br />Connelly does a masterful job of setting up an intricate narrative that features believable characters, crisp dialogue, and compelling courtroom scenes.  \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is funny, brash, cynical, suspenseful, and at times, shocking.  I have some reservations about the plot, which has gaping holes that are never filled.  However, this is a book with bite.  It is an entertaining, thought-provoking, and immensely satisfying novel that is sure to be huge hit.at are never filled.  However, this is a book with bite.

Reginald Hill's \\"The Stranger House\\" is an intricate story about two people who meet in the village of Illthwaite, in Cumbria, England.  Samantha Flood is a spunky Aussie in her early twenties.  She's a brash and curious mathematician who plans to continue her graduate studies in Cambridge.  However, Sam takes some time off to do some digging into her family's background.  Miguel Ramos Elkington Madero, known as Mig, is five years older than Sam, and he is very different from her.  While Sam is a pragmatist who has no use for religion, Mig is a Catholic who once studied for the priesthood.  Over the years, he has had strange visions and has experienced unexplained pain and bleeding from his palms.  Mig has come to Illthwaite from Spain in order to explore the experiences of English Catholics during the Reformation.  Do Sam and Mig encounter one another in this tiny village by chance, or has fate brought these two people together for some special purpose?<br /><br />\\"The Stranger House\\" moves back and forth in time as Hill examines the history of Illthwaite going back several generations.  Most of the town's inhabitants seem friendly enough on the surface, but they become closed-mouthed and evasive when discussing the past.  Eventually, the tenacious Mig and Sam uncover some shocking information that sheds an entirely new light on their ancestry.  They find out that although Illthwaite seems to be a quiet and nondescript place, some of its citizens may have committed and covered up heinous crimes.<br /><br />Hill shines in his vivid depiction of the countryside and the eccentric English villagers.  All of his characters are original and outstandingly realized.  Sam Flood is bright, inquisitive, irrepressible, and nobody's fool. Although she looks younger than her years, she is far from naive.  Sam senses that the town is reluctant to give up its secrets, but she refuses to back down until she gets some answers.  Mig is a deeply spiritual individual whose carnal desires overtake him at odd moments.  He is a scholar with an appreciation for history, and he is shocked when he finds out that his quest coincides with Sam's.<br /><br />This is a deliberately paced and subtle psychological thriller about how and why the inhabitants of Illthwaite are so reluctant to tell Sam and Mig the truth.  The book has a \\"Rashomon\\" feel to it, since different narrators relate key events from their own particular perspectives.  In addition, Hill makes ample use of flashbacks and foreshadowing to drop hints and clues, but the dizzying swirl of events begins to make sense only at the end of this lengthy novel.  For the patient and careful reader who loves a literary challenge, \\"The Stranger House\\" provides rich rewards.

Sue Monk Kidd's latest novel, \\"The Mermaid Chair,\\" tells the story of Jessie Sullivan, who leaves her psychiatrist husband, Hugh, in Atlanta, in order to care for her mother in South Carolina.  Nelle Dubois has shown signs of instability in the past, but when she cuts off one of her fingers, her daughter decides to travel to Egret Island to help her mother through this crisis.  Jessie has a difficult decision to make. Should she commit Nelle to a psychiatric hospital or is her mother's self-destructive act a temporary aberration that is unlikely to be repeated?<br /><br />Adding to Jessie's confusion is her powerful attraction to Brother Thomas, a monk who lives in a nearby Benedictine monastery.  Brother Thomas was known as Whit O'Conner in his former life.  After losing his wife and unborn child in an accident, Whit brokenheartedly retreated from the world, seeking peace of mind in nature and God.  He is now planning to take his final vows as a monk, but meeting Jessie has made him doubt his vocation.<br /><br />Although Jessie still cares for her husband, her marriage has grown somewhat stale and predictable.  In Whit, Jessie may have found her soulmate, but can she realistically enjoy a future with this man?  During her stay on Egret Island, Jessie revisits her past and takes stock of her life.  She thinks fondly of her beloved father, Joe, who died in a boat explosion when she was nine.  Jessie, who is an artist, is inspired by the natural beauty of this lush setting to create original paintings expressing her deepest feelings.<br /><br />In \\"The Mermaid Chair,\\" I found echoes of Kidd's smash bestseller, \\"The Secret Life of Bees.\\"  In both novels, Kidd explores the themes of female friendship, forgiveness, and spirituality.  Nelle's steadfast cronies, Kat and Hepzibah,  support her over the years, even as her behavior becomes more and more bizarre.  Nelle is obsessed with religion and martyrdom, and she is hiding a terrible secret that feeds her inner torment.  Only when Nelle, Jessie, and Whit face the truth about themselves can they successfully move on with their lives.<br /><br />\\"The Mermaid Chair\\" works on some levels better than others.  It is an engrossing character study of a man and a woman who have lost their way.  Both seek to make sense of a world in which innocent people seem to suffer for no reason.  The descriptive writing in \\"The Mermaid Chair\\" is vivid and evocative.  Kidd makes the fictional Egret Island come to life, with its tidal marshes, exotic birds, and wild beauty.

Dannie Faber and her husband, Tom, are a couple in their fifties whose relationship, on the surface, appears to be solid. Tom is an anthropology professor at M. I. T. and Dannie is a children's book illustrator. Dannie adores nature and lives in her beach house in Truro from April to November. Tom spends part of the summer in Cape Cod with Dannie, but the two are often apart.<br /><br />Dannie's need to live in Truro goes to the very core of her being. She is fond of gazing at \\"the sky as blue as a Delft plate, and almost cloudless except for a few wisps near the horizon.\\" She and her environmentally minded friends are irate when a wealthy hotel magnate named Mitch Brenner builds a monstrous house in Truro. Dannie is also perturbed when her daughter, Beth, takes time off from work to visit her; Beth is disconsolate after breaking up with her boyfriend, Andy. Dannie's life becomes still more complicated when she becomes romantically involved with her editor, David Lipsett. The Fabers are about to undergo some painful changes and no one will emerge completely unscathed.<br /><br />Anne Bernays examines the well-worn theme of middle-aged angst and she throws in some random comments about religious prejudice, 9/11, and politics. \\"Trophy House\\" is an unfocused novel in which the author fails to adequately explore the minds and hearts of her characters. Although she captures the idyllic beauty of Cape Cod with some fine descriptive writing, Bernays does less well when she depicts the decision to end a marriage as being just another lifestyle choice. Ultimately, it is difficult to care about the quirky, fickle, and shallow characters in \\"Trophy House.\\"	2005-10-06

This time he is defending Emiliano Ruiz, a former military man accused of killing Madelyn Chapman, the arrogant and fabulously wealthy CEO of a successful software company.  Ruiz worked for a private security firm providing executive protection for Madelyn, and it is no secret that the two had been lovers.  The prosecution claims that Chapman wanted to end their affair, providing Ruiz with a motive for murder. The state is seeking the death penalty.<br /><br />Ruiz is a closed-mouth client whose lack of cooperation troubles Madriani.  To make matters worse, the prosecutor turns out to be Larry Templeton, who is known for his brilliant and ruthless courtroom tactics.  Madriani knows better than to underestimate his opponent, a Stanford Law School Graduate with a record of eighteen wins in court, and no losses in a capital case. All of the evidence points to Ruiz.  The defendant's military issued firearm was the murder weapon and the perp appears to have been an experienced sharpshooter.  Who, other than Ruiz, had the motive, means, and opportunity to kill Chapman?<br /><br />\\"Double Tap\\" is an engrossing courtroom drama with lively characters, dry humor, and crisp dialogue.  Martini explores some topical themes, including whether it is ethical for the United States government to use spyware,  a software program that allows bureaucrats to snoop into the private lives of its citizens in the name of national security.  Madriani thinks that this case may be more about government secrecy than it is about a love affair gone sour.  Another theme is America's ingratitude to its combat veterans, who have served their country at great cost to their own mental and physical well-being.  Madriani's Uncle Evo was a veteran who suffered horribly after he came back to the states, and in his memory, Madriani wants to make sure that Emiliano Ruiz gets a fair shake.<br /><br />\\"Double Tap\\" has its flaws.

Her characters are, for the most part, self-centered, dysfunctional, and quirky. One of the central figures in this thriller is Mix Cellini, a man who fixes exercise equipment for a living. He is obsessed with Reggie Christie, a serial killer who murdered six women fifty years ago. Mix has collected every book he can find about Christie, and he reads them again and again. At the same time, Cellini is convinced that a gorgeous and rich supermodel named Nerissa Nash is his true love. The trouble is, how can he convince Nerissa that she is meant for him? He decides to stalk her and attempt to make her acquaintance. In his delusional state, he believes that she will quickly succumb to his charms and agree to date him.<br /><br />Cellini's landlord is Gwendolen Chaucer, an elderly woman who lives in the past, has allowed her stately home to deteriorate into a filthy sty, and buries herself in books to avoid facing reality. Although Mix and Gwendolen share a house, they have an innate dislike and mistrust of one another that increases over time. Mix hides a well of tremendous anger that stems from having lived years ago with an abusive stepfather. Mix's temper gets him into terrible trouble, and he soon commits an act that he will long regret. Meanwhile, Gwendolen's health is failing. In her confused state, she dreams that a man named Stephen, whom she loved long ago, will come back some day to renew their friendship.<br /><br />Rendell's novels invariably reveal the most depressing aspects of human nature. Her characters believe themselves to be better and smarter than they really are. True love is a rare commodity. Criminals are self-destructive and stupid, making mistakes that will come back to haunt them. Children who have had indifferent or cruel parents rarely grow into happy, independent, and fully productive members of society. Loneliness is a bitter and corrosive poison that slowly eats away at people's self-esteem and, eventually, their sanity.<br /><br />\\"13 Steps\\" is one of Rendell's darkest novels. Mix is an immature, arrogrant, impetuous, and incredibly neurotic man whom the reader cannot help but despise. Gwendolen is not much better than Mix. She is querulous, nasty, and rude to the friends who try to help her. Most of the secondary characters are one-dimensional stereotypes. The action in the book is not particularly suspenseful, the many coincidences that permeate the plot are completely implausible, and the ending is flat and unsatisfying. \\"13 Steps Down\\" offers little but gloom and despair; there is almost no humor to provide some needed comic relief. Worse, the characters are so negative and unpleasant that reading about them is more a chore than a pleasure.

After I saw a documentary about Rafe Esquith, I decided to read \\"There Are No Shortcuts,\\" in which this unique educator gives his perspective on the rewards, challenges, and disappointments of teaching in a Los Angeles public school.  Esquith has two decades under his belt fighting entrenched bureaucrats who prefer conformity to individuality.  During his years in Hobart Elementary School, he has taught inner-city children Shakespeare and other works of classic literature as well as advanced mathematics and music.  In addition, he has given his students the skills and the confidence to achieve more than they ever dreamed was possible. All of this comes at a price.  Esquith almost went bankrupt paying for the materials that he needed to support his curriculum, and he ended up in the hospital after putting in long hours with little sleep.  He still works from dawn to dusk, as well as on Saturdays and school holidays, but he attempts to avoid burnout by occasionally taking some time off to relax with his family.<br /><br />One of Esquith's mottos is \\"work hard, be nice.\\"  He certainly works hard, but he is not always nice in his criticism of the educational establishment.  He skewers incompetent and indifferent teachers and administrators, ridicules irrational and obstructive rules and regulations, and even has a few harsh words for his own union, which he has supported over the years.  Anything or anyone who prevents an educator from doing whatever he can to bring out the best in every student gets thumbs down from Esquith.  He believes that a teacher should be able to come into school to work with students during his free time, be allowed to take kids on overnight trips, be permitted to create his own course of study, and be given respect by his fellow educators, even though he refuses to toe the party line.<br /><br />\\"There Are No Shortcuts\\" is not a \\"how-to\\" book for new public school teachers.  If anything, it's a cautionary tale about how a person who sticks his neck out is in danger of getting it chopped off.  Esquith is not now and has never been a typical teacher, and few will have the desire or the energy to emulate him.  However, he is inspiring in his desire to uncover his students' untapped talents, and he has given a great gift to those fortunate enough to have been in his classroom.  It is heartwarming to learn that some of Esquith's former students go on to Ivy League schools and become successful professionals.  Many of them keep in touch with their former mentor and a few take the time to revisit Hobart to lend a hand.  It is also amazing that such luminaries as Ian McKellan and Hal Holbrook are enthusiastic fans of Esquith who regularly visit his classes.<br /><br />Although Rafe Esquith is an award-winning teacher who has received widespread media coverage, he is not a saint.  He confesses that he has made some serious errors, and he admits that he may occasionally come across as rude and intolerant.  Esquith's passion for his job and his disparagement of teachers who coast rather than strive for excellence has aroused animosity in some of his colleagues who may be resentful of his fame and what they perceive as his sense of entitlement.  Why should they have to follow the rules while Rafe Esquith gets special treatment?  He makes no bones about how little patience he has for the many underachievers who stand in front of the nation's classrooms.  These include educators who are lazy, rarely read, use the boring textbooks provided by the school instead of stimulating materials, and who refuse to give even a minute extra of their time to their students.  Is Rafe Esquith an altruistic and heroic individual who is correct in his assessment of public education?  Or is he an arrogant, unrealistic, and self-serving publicity hound?  Whether you are a cheerleader or a critic, no one can dispute the fact that this is a man who expects a great deal of himself, his students, and everyone else, and he has no intention oflowering his standards anytime soon.ards anytime soon.	2005-09-25

Robert Tanenbaum's new novel, \\"Fury,\\" is the seventeenth in his Butch Karp/Marlene Ciampi series. Butch Karp is now the interim Manhattan DA in a city filled with racial and political tension. In spite of the pressures of his job, Butch is not complaining. Much to his relief, his wife of twenty-five years is no longer involved in her usual wild and dangerous escapades. In fact, Marlene is trying to keep a low profile, and she seems content to spend more time at home with her family. For a change, everything seems to be going smoothly for the Karps. Little do they know that trouble is brewing on several fronts.<br /><br />First, a group of black men, who have been nicknamed \\"the Coney Island Four,\\" are suing the city. They claim that they were railroaded into confessing to the brutal rape and beating of a female jogger named Liz Tyler. Although the men spent time in prison, they are now free and have the support of an opportunistic lawyer named Hugh Louis who loves to play the race card. Michael Denton, the Mayor-elect of New York, and Richard Torrisi, the attorney for the Police Benevolent Association, ask Butch Karp to step in and represent the city as special counsel. Denton and Torrisi want a man of known integrity at the helm, and Butch reluctantly agrees to help.<br /><br />\\"Fury\\" also deals with Middle Eastern terrorists who are planning a major strike against Manhattan on New Year's Eve. There is also the high-profile case of Sarah Ryder, who claims that her Russian professor, Alexis Michalik, raped her after drugging her drink. Michalik, who is happily married and awaiting the birth of his first child, vehemently denies Sarah's charges. As usual, Karp and his family get involved in all of these story lines and Butch once again wages war against corrupt cops, lawyers, and judges.<br /><br />Tanenbaum throws in a host of both new and familiar characters, including the aforementioned terrorists, Russian gangsters, \\"mole people\\" who live under the streets of New York, John Jojola, a spiritual police chief from New Mexico, and a Vietnamese man named Tran, all of whom play key roles in the novel. Ace reporter and snoop, saucy Ariadne Stupenagel, is still nosing into Karp's business, and Butch's old cronies, Ray Guma and V. T. Newbury, are on hand to lend Butch some much needed assistance.<br /><br />Not only has Tanenbaum attempted to do too much this time around, but he also goes over the same ground that he has covered many times before. Although there is a bit of romance and cutesy humor to lighten things up a bit, \\"Fury\\" is dizzying, much too complicated, repetitious, and extremely implausible. The overburdened narrative eventually sinks under its own enormous weight. Butch, Marlene, and their children again play the roles of superheroes, as they have so many times in the past.<br /><br />There is no question that Tanenbaum knows New York, and he always deals with timely themes in a lively manner. He captures the earthy dialogue of the city's streetwise denizens, and he is intimately acquainted with the ins and outs of the criminal justice system. His courtroom scenes are as entertaining as ever.  However, at almost five hundred pages, \\"Fury\\" is a bloated tome featuring cartoonish characters involved in far-fetched situations.

Rothke has written an up-to-date, clear, and concise introduction to the many dangers that lurk in cyberspace.  He covers such topics as phishing, spyware, identity theft, e-mail hoaxes, data management, firewalls, and choosing a secure password.<br /><br />\\"Computer Security\\" would be most useful as a handout for new hires who work in a corporate setting.  Rothke warns workers to use discretion when surfing the Web, and to avoid downloading anything unless they are sure that it safe.  Employers do not look too kindly on employees who use their databases carelessly and frivolously.  Attention to confidentiality, assiduously backing up important data, and the ability to avoid introducing viruses or other invaders into the company computer system are essential priorities for every staff member.<br /><br />This handbook is nicely laid out, easy to read, and relatively jargon free.  At the end of the book is a handy glossary of computer security terms.  Bulleted lists and summaries reinforce the important points that the reader should remember. This is an excellent introduction to a subject that is vital for anyone who works with computers in a business setting or even at home.

The main action in Eileen Dreyer's new thriller, \\"Sinners and Saints,\\" is set in New Orleans on the eve of a hurricane.  The lead character, forensic nurse Chastity Byrnes, is an emotional wreck because of past traumas that she hints at but does not spell out until later in the book.  She has been seeing a therapist for a long time, takes antianxiety medication, and is terrified of drowning. However, she valiantly picks herself up from her relatively safe haven in St. Louis and answers a call for help from her brother-in-law, surgeon Max Stanton.  It seems that Faith Stanton, Chastity's sister and Max's wife, has gone missing and Max asks Chastity to help find her.  Chastity has been out of touch with Faith for years, but she decides that it is her duty to assist Max in any way that she can.<br /><br />Max gives Chastity carte blanche to search his house and papers in an effort to garner clues about Faith's whereabouts.  While in New Orleans, Chastity takes advantage of the hospitality of a fellow nurse named Kareena Boudreaux, a saucy and sexy Cajun woman with a colorful way of speaking.  To get around New Orleans, Chastity hires James Guidry, a physically and emotionally scarred ex-fireman; he proves to be a handy man to have around in a crisis.  Chastity contacts everyone who knew Faith and she discovers that her sister had been visiting a fertility clinic.  Could the clinic somehow be connected to Faith's disappearance?  Much to Chastity's chagrin, some of the people whom she interviews turn up dead, and she feels guilty for having put them in danger.  Unfortunately, the New Orleans police are not much help.  As the hurricane nears and threatens to flood the city, Chastity is tempted to hop on the next plane back to St. Louis before she is either swept away by the tides or murdered by a sadistic killer.<br /><br />Eileen Dreyer captures the ambiance of New Orleans perfectly.  She nails the \\"anything goes\\" party atmosphere, the obsession with death and cemeteries, and the feeling of imminent danger that goes with living in a place that lies below sea level.  Unfortunately, this is a very talky book with dialogue that is sometimes stilted and silly (I get irritated every time Chastity calls James \\"Fireman\\" and he calls her \\"Nurse,\\") but the patois spoken by certain characters such as a psychic named Tante Edie is colorful and intriguing.<br /><br />\\"Sinners and Saints\\" is a pedestrian mystery with a bunch of red herrings that do not lead anywhere.  The novel drags towards the conclusion; it could easily have been trimmed by at least fifty pages with no loss of coherence.  However, there are some worthwhile elements that redeem the novel somewhat.  Chastity is an appealing heroine, with her mixture of fear and spunk, and it is entertaining to watch her relationship with James heat up.

Unfortunately, this is a very talky book with dialogue that is sometimes stilted and silly (I get irritated every time Chastity calls James \\"Fireman\\" and he calls her \\"Nurse,\\") but the patois spoken by certain characters such as a psychic named Tante Edie is colorful and intriguing.      \\"Sinners and Saints\\" is a pedestrian mystery with a bunch of red herrings that do not lead anywhere.  The novel drags towards the conclusion; it could easily have been trimmed by at least fifty pages with no loss of coherence.  However, there are some worthwhile elements that redeem the novel somewhat.  Chastity is an appealing heroine, with her mixture of fear and spunk, and it is entertaining to watch her relationship with James heat up.

61365:US	51210331	R3QCQD2GXPQPQW	0151012164	656820452	Fiddlers: A Novel of the 87th Precinct (87th Precinct Mysteries)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Never forgive, never forget.	\\"Fiddlers,\\" by the late Ed McBain, is a worthy finale to the long and illustrious career of a true grand master.  An unknown assailant has been murdering both men and women, all of whom are over the age of fifty.  The victims were all shot in the face with the same weapon--a Glock.  Since the first killing occurred in the jurisdiction of the 87th precinct, Carella, Meyer, Parker, and their colleagues catch the case.  The detectives follow up every lead painstakingly, and their thorough investigation reveals a motive that has its roots in a series of events that occurred many years ago.<br /><br />McBain's writing style is unique and refreshing.  He never indulges in purple prose, clich&eacute;s, or needless exposition.  The dialogue is energetic and witty, and the action never flags.  Another hallmark of McBain's novels is their ambiguous and complex world view.  McBain doesn't present the reader with one-dimensional characters who are easily pigeonholed, nor does he tie up every loose end.  Good people sometimes suffer, bad people often go unpunished, and mistakes cannot always be undone.  In McBain's universe, life is unfair and it's up to the individual to cope as best he can.<br /><br />McBain captures the grittiness of modern urban life. He describes how people of various ethnic groups desperately compete for their share of the American dream, either legally or otherwise.  All of the 87th Precinct novels convey the dark side of living in the big city, with its profanity, racism, and various criminal elements who routinely deal in drugs, prostitution, and murder.  \\"Fiddlers\\" has a large and colorful cast, including the aforementioned detectives, a slightly slimmer and mellower Ollie Weeks, and an angry perp with a long memory.  McBain humanizes his cops, showing us not only their ability to work a homicide, but also providing a window into their family lives, romances, hopes, and disappointments.  We grow to care about them as much as we care about the work that they do.  This book is a powerful, touching, and poignant look at what makes us human--our desire for love and respect and for some, the need to blame others for their failures.  \\"Fiddlers\\" represents McBain at his best.  What more could anyone want?a powerful, touching, and poignant look at what makes us human--our desire for love and respect and for some, the need to blame others for their failures.  \\"Fiddlers\\" represents McBain at his best.

Medical examiner Sara Linton has had an uneasy relationship with her ex-husband, police chief Jeffrey Tolliver, for years.  In spite of their differences, Sara and Jeffrey have never stopped loving one another.  Now, the two are taking tentative steps towards a reconciliation, but obstacles still remain.  Lena Adams is a detective who works under Jeffrey's supervision, and she is one messed up woman.  Although Lena is a good cop, much to her secret shame, she is also a human punching bag for her abusive and cruel boyfriend.  Lena's personal problems have a way of interfering with her work, and Jeffrey is losing patience with her.  Jeffrey, Sara, and Lena do not have the luxury of concentrating on themselves for very long.  Much to his shock, Jeffrey literally stumbles on the grave of a young woman named Abby who may have been buried alive.  His investigation brings him into contact with a strange family of religious fanatics who are harboring dark secrets.<br /><br />\\"Faithless\\" is an uneven effort by Karin Slaughter.  I have been following Jeffrey, Sara, and Lena for some time, and I admire their complexity, sensitivity, and vulnerability.  These are flawed people, who are sometimes jealous, insecure, impetuous, and unforgiving.  They are also caring individuals who have compassion for others.  Their imperfections, as well as their strengths, endear these characters to us, and we hope that someday they will find peace of mind.<br /><br />The mystery, alas, is the weakest element in the book.  It involves a closely knit group of people who attend church, quote the Bible frequently, and run a prosperous soybean farm.  They also routinely take in miscreants, hoping that their exposure to religion and good works will inspire them to change their ways.  When a second girl disappears without a trace, Jeffrey fears that she may have met the same fate as Abby.  He racks his brain for some clue that will break the case.  Who killed Abby--a stranger, a member of her family, or perhaps an ex-criminal?<br /><br />Another subplot involves a battered woman named Terri, whose brutal husband seems likely to kill her someday.  Like Lena, Terri refuses to turn her abuser over to the police.  Slaughter effectively explores the tragic scenario of women with low self-esteem who think that they \\"deserve\\" to be beaten by their lovers and husbands.  Unfortunately, as the book progresses, it loses some of its momentum, and the convoluted conclusion is both melodramatic and far-fetched.  Still, I applaud Slaughter for not tying up all of the loose ends neatly; she leaves some plot lines unresolved, perhaps in preparation for the next installment in the series.  Although \\"Faithless\\" is not a first-rate mystery, the lead characters are so charismatic that we are willing to stick with them in order to find out how they resolve their problems.ex-criminal?

Barbara Ehrenreich's latest work of social commentary, \\"Bait and Switch: The (Futile) Pursuit of the American Dream,\\" is an indictment of the \\"magisterial indifference of the corporate world.\\" Posing as an unemployed white-collar worker, Ehrenreich adopts an alias and markets herself as a public relations person and event planner. Her goal is to obtain a corporate job that pays approximately fifty thousand a year with health benefits. She plans to keep the job for three or four months, write about her experiences, and then quit. The author sets aside five thousand dollars for travel and other expenses connected with her job search.<br /><br />During her odyssey, Ehrenreich pays for career coaching, attends a job fair, posts her resume on Internet sites, enrolls in a boot camp for job seekers, and networks extensively. She learns to sell herself, treat job searching as a full-time job, always maintain a winning attitude, put her faith in God, and dress for success. Much to her surprise, Ehrenreich's efforts do not land her a suitable job. She asks herself: Do I lack charisma? Am I too old? Is it unrealistic in today's market to look for a decent job with health benefits?<br /><br />The author acknowledges that any or all of the above may have been factors in her failure to find work. However, she wrote the book because she believes that there is a bigger problem holding job-seekers back--corporate America's indifference to the needs of its workers. Ehrenreich maintains that human resources departments rarely even acknowledge receiving a resume anymore. Even worse, when an applicant sends in a bid for a job, he is often the victim of \\"bait and switch\\" tactics. Instead of offering the advertised job, the company rep tries to convince the job seeker to settle for a lesser job with no benefits or job security. In desperation, some white-collar workers take \\"survival jobs\\" such as housecleaning, cab driving, and retail sales in order to put food on the table. When the income from these jobs does not cover the bills, these stressed-out individuals max out their credit cards, seek help from relatives, and downsize their lifestyles as much as possible. Without health insurance, workers are terrified of becoming become ill because they have no money to pay for medical care and prescription drugs.<br /><br />Ehrenreich is a savvy writer who throws herself wholeheartedly into whatever project she undertakes. She skillfully depicts the humiliation and frustration of her futile job search. However, this book will probably not resonate with readers in the same way that Ehrenreich's bestseller \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" did. First, the author's experiences while she looks for work lack bite; they are not very dramatic or gripping. Furthermore, Ehrenreich's indictment of corporate America breaks no new ground. Anyone who reads a newspaper knows about downsizing, outsourcing, and greedy and corrupt CEOs who make big bucks while their lower level employees lose their retirement funds.<br /><br />So why read this book? \\"Bait and Switch\\" is worth a look because of the author's self-deprecating humor, effortless writing style, and compassion for the victims of heartless companies. Ehrenreich exhorts middle class job seekers to become activists, urging them to protest the fact that people who \\"do everything right\\" and \\"play by the rules\\" often end up in ruins. The problem is that even if such individuals find the courage to mount some sort of protest, who would listen? \\"Bait and Switch\\" gets high marks for the author's lively presentation and style but lower marks for her exploration of an already well-publicized problem without offering a viable solution.obs does not cover the bills, these stressed-out individuals max out their credit cards, seek help from relatives, and downsize their lifestyles as much as possible.

Alice Blanchard's \\"Life Sentences\\" poses the question:  How much of our physical and mental health is determined by our genes and how much by our environment?  If a person is unlucky enough to inherit one or more faulty genes, is he inevitably doomed?  Daisy Hubbard is a researcher based in Boston who works for an arrogant scientist named Marlon Truett.  Daisy has no boyfriend, a schizophrenic sister named Anna who has brought her family untold grief, and a widowed mother.  Her work is her life--she is trying to cure Stier-Zellar's disease, a rare genetic disorder that killed her half-brother.  When Daisy's sister disappears, her mother convinces Daisy to fly to Los Angeles to track Anna down.<br /><br />Daisy's quest brings her together with an LAPD detective named Jack Makowski, a compulsive do-gooder and a tenacious cop.  Jack has been working on three other missing persons cases, and Anna will be his fourth.  His investigation leads him to a sociopath named Roy who is hiding some dreadful secrets that will bring Daisy's world crashing down around her.<br /><br />\\"Life Sentences\\" is a quirky book that branches off in a number of directions.  In the beginning, it seems that the author is writing a medical thriller about genetic diseases.  Then, Blanchard delves into the deep-seated family problems that plague Daisy, Anna, and their mother Lily.  The author also probes the mind of the villain, whose sick behavior stems from an abnormal childhood.  There is a romantic subplot involving Daisy and Jack, and the book concludes with a series of violent confrontations between Roy and the good guys.<br /><br />Does the book work?  Yes and no.  We get to know Daisy well, and we sympathize with this sad woman whose devotion to her career cannot make up for her loneliness, insecurity, and bitter memories.  Detective Jack Makowski does not seem to be an ideal match for a woman like Daisy, but somehow the two fit well together.  Unfortunately, the book descends into fantasy when Blanchard paints the villain as a brilliant conniver who effortlessly deceives the hapless cops time and again.  The detectives make ridiculously amateurish mistakes that enable Roy to carry out his twisted plans.<br /><br />\\"Life Sentences\\" is an instructive look at \\"orphan diseases\\" and the consequences for those who are carriers.  Blanchard's descriptive writing and dialogue are lively, and although the four-hundred page book could have been trimmed a bit, the story moves along at a good pace.  However, \\"Life Sentences\\" would have been even better had it featured a more realistic villain and a more tightly focused plot.asy when Blanchard paints the villain as a brilliant conniver who effortlessly deceives the hapless cops time and again.

Tess Gerrtisen's \\"Vanish\\" has the same general theme as another engrossing novel that I read a few weeks ago--\\"Dead End,\\" by Mariah Stewart.  Both books deal with the loathsome practice of importing vulnerable young girls into the United States from countries such as Mexico and the former Soviet Union.  These girls are beaten, drugged, imprisoned, and sold into prostitution.<br /><br />\\"Vanish\\" features some familiar faces, including Boston Detective Jane Rizzoli, who is nine months pregnant, Gabriel Dean, Jane's devoted FBI agent husband, and medical examiner Dr. Maura Isles.  The book opens as a seventeen-year-old girl named Mila, from Belarus, tells the heartbreaking tale of how she and other like her were lured into the United States under false pretenses.  Gerritsen then switches gears as a startled Maura Isles finds a corpse in her morgue who is still breathing.  Next, a man and woman with a hidden agenda hold Jane Rizzoli hostage.  A negotiator is brought in an attempt to bring the standoff to a peaceful conclusion.  These seemingly unrelated plot lines gradually merge into one suspenseful and horrifying narrative about the abuse of power by influential, wealthy, and immoral individuals.<br /><br />I have always loved Jane Rizzoli, and motherhood takes away none of her feistiness.  Whether she is trying to control her pain during labor contractions, attempting to soothe her screaming baby, or confronting a vicious murderer, Jane is always thinking, planning, and looking for solutions.  Gabriel, Jane's beleaguered husband, wishes his wife were just a little more laid back, but he cannot help admiring her honesty and depth of feeling.  These two are an interesting and offbeat couple, and their scenes together are wonderful.<br /><br />Gerritsen is in top form here.  She incorporates many elements seamlessly--gentle humor, political skullduggery, terrifying and suspenseful confrontations, betrayal of trust, and a nail-biting conclusion.  Using a spare style that avoids melodrama, the author's realistic dialogue, well-developed characterizations, and excellent pacing make \\"Vanish\\" a first-rate and thought-provoking thriller.e author's realistic dialogue, well-developed characterizations, and excellent pacing make \\"Vanish\\" a first-rate and thought-provoking thriller.	2005-08-28

A grizzled old prospector, Marston \\"Stem\\" Weathers, has made an astonishing discovery--the location of the largest and most well preserved dinosaur fossil ever found.  He would like to keep his secret under wraps until he can cash in on it.  Little does Weathers know that that an unscrupulous scientist has already hired a vicious ex-con to track him down and steal his notes.  As luck would have it, Stem's notebook somehow falls into the hands of an innocent bystander named Tom Broadbent.<br /><br />Tom approaches a former CIA agent and monk-in-training named Wyman Ford to help break the notebook's code.  However, there are ruthless and powerful people who are equally interested in solving this puzzle, and \\"Tyrannosaur Canyon\\" involves a lengthy and deadly race between the good guys and the bad guys.  Who will find the reptile first?  Which characters will die trying?  Preston peppers his narrative with fascinating facts about the biology and history of the great T-Rex, making her a central character in the story.  Another key player is Dr. Melodie Crookshank, a brilliant and underappreciated scientist with an advanced degree in geophysical chemistry, who faces the greatest intellectual challenge of her so far undistinguished career.<br /><br />The action never flags.  There are thrilling chase scenes, several murders, breathtaking moments in the laboratory, amazing military hardware, and some really cool science.  Preston writes evocative descriptive passages describing the lonely and forbidding vistas of the vast desert, and when the heroes go for a long stretch without water, the reader feels their horrendous thirst.  The book's premise is pure fantasy and the ending is way over-the-top.  Still, \\"Tyrannosaur Canyon\\" is an entertaining and escapist adventure novel, with colorful characters risking their lives to get their hands on the biggest fossil of them all.	2005-08-26

In \\"Love, Work, Children,\\" Cheryl Mendelson continues her scrutiny of the eccentric, well-to-do, and sophisticated people who populate the Manhattan neighborhood of Morningside Heights. Mendelson focuses on Peter Frankl, his wife, Lesley, and their two grown children, Susan and Louis. Peter is miserable in his job at a law firm, and he secretly dislikes his self-centered wife. However, being a moral and altruistic man, Peter would not consider divorcing Lesley and, for the most part, he suffers in silence. However, when Lesley gets into a serious car accident, the family's equilibrium is upset and nothing is ever the same again.<br /><br />Mendelson's leisurely prose style requires great patience from the reader. The author digs deeply into the psyches of at least a half-dozen main characters, and her complicated plot unfolds at a snail's pace. Romance plays a large part in this novel, and there are a number of young lovers who engage in complicated mating rituals before they settle down with their soulmates. As the title implies, the author also examines the world of work, especially what makes a job either satisfying or stultifying. In \\"Love, Work, Children\\" Mendelson looks at a particular lifestyle in which everyone knows everyone else's business and no one hesitates to interfere with people's lives.<br /><br />The characters in this book are colorful and offbeat. Besides the Frankl family, we meet Mallory, a pretty and popular young woman who is a fledgling journalist and Alexei, a young Russian man who is good looking, brilliant, talented, and very poor. He is a chess grandmaster who sings divinely, fixes computers, and gives a large part of his meager earnings to his family. Alexei pursues Mallory, but she looks down at him, since his future is so insecure. Hilda Hughes is a frumpy and nervous woman who works for the Devereaux Foundation, a charitable organization to which Peter Frankl is devoted. Hilda is very intelligent and insightful, but she is also isolated and a bit batty. Her sessions with her therapist are very amusing and undoubtedly helpful because, over time, Hilda slowly starts to emerge from her shell. If there are villains in this story, they are Edmond Lockhart, his estranged wife Wanda, and his partner, Ivy Hurst. Edmond, Wanda, and Ivy are selfish, mean-spirited, and devious, and they cause the Frankls much grief.<br /><br />Cheryl Mendelson's novels are not for everyone. Readers who like fast-moving narratives and clear cut themes may find Mendelson irritating. However, those who love well-developed characters and gentle humor will be entertained, and many readers will enjoy the author's thoughtful riffs on life's vicissitudes. \\"Love, Work, and Children\\" explores many important themes: Is everyone suited to be a parent?

Finn grew up on Boston's mean streets, the product of a rough childhood and more than a few brushes with the law.  He decides to go straight, and after obtaining a law degree, he becomes a public defender and eventually lands a lucrative job with a prestigious firm.  Finn is an associate on the rise and he is anticipating being made partner. On the down side, he has no family with whom he can celebrate his professional success.<br /><br />Finn's world suddenly turns upside down when the body of his colleague and former girlfriend, Natalie Caldwell, is found floating in the harbor, the victim of a brutal homicide.  At first, the police believe that Natalie was the seventh victim of a serial killer known as \\"Little Jack,\\" who had already murdered and mutilated six prostitutes.  However, there are differences between the first six crimes and Natalie's death.  These anomalies are giving the officer in charge of the case, Detective Lieutenant Linda Flaherty, reason to doubt that all seven murders were committed by the same man.  Because of his closeness to Natalie and because she had rejected him for another man, Finn becomes a person of interest to the police.<br /><br />So far, so good.  Unfortunately, Hosp's reliance on numerous cliches prevents \\"Dark Harbor\\" from realizing its potential.  Finn is a former hoodlum who makes it out of the neighborhood, yet retains a friendship with a boyhood pal who is still \\"connected\\"; Natalie Caldwell is a brilliant attorney who falls for an older man against her better judgment; \\"Little Jack\\" is a psychopathic religious zealot who kills prostitutes because he thinks that he is God's messenger; sleazy, corrupt and greedy politicians and lawyers sell their souls for power and money; an attractive female detective is drawn to Finn, but hesitates to act on her feelings because he is a suspect.  All of these scenarios are familiar because they have figured prominently in so many other novels.<br /><br />Still, Scott Finn is a likeable protagonist.  He is a smart, honest, and decent guy, and when he risks his life to find out the truth about Natalie's death, the reader cares enough about him to fear for his safety.  I like some of the other characters as well, including Tigh McCluen, Finn's boyhood friend, who is street smart and crooked, but still retains a sense of fair play, and Linda Flaherty, a female detective who is both tough and uncompromising.

She is still grieving for her dead fiance, Special Agent Dylan Shields, who was killed more than two years earlier in an undercover operation that turned sour. Pennsylvania Detective Evan Crosby is now Annie's lover, but he is having a hard time competing with Dylan's memory.  After a nasty quarrel with Annie, Evan suggests that both he and Annie reexamine Dylan's death to see if they can uncover any fresh leads.  Little does the couple know that by opening up this old case, they are trespassing into dangerous territory.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Evan has other pressing items on his plate.  A series of wealthy young teenaged girls have been found dead, the victims of a serial killer, and he and his colleagues are trying to find clues that will lead to the perpetrator.  Equally perplexing, when more corpses of teenaged girls turn up, they are of unidentified Hispanic girls who have never been reported missing by their parents.<br /><br />Thus begins Mariah Stewart's \\"Dead End,\\" a fast-paced romantic thriller that features engaging protagonists and a compelling plot.  Stewart deftly balances her large cast of characters, including FBI agents, county detectives, and assorted villains and victims.  The dialogue is, for the most part, realistic, although there are some stilted exchanges when the loose ends are tied up at the end.  Stewart inserts clues and hints along the way to give the reader a fair shake at guessing the outcome, and she also puts in enough red herrings to keep us off balance.  However, the outcome will not greatly surprise most attentive readers.<br /><br />To her credit, Stewart expertly handles the love story between Evan and Annie.  They are equals in every sense of the word; both are respected professionals who value one another not just as lovers, but also as human beings.

He dresses in rumpled and out-of-date clothes.  She is passionate and excitable.  He is cool and collected.  However, both Manny and Jake share one important characteristic.  Neither one can stand idly by when someone needs help.<br /><br />Jake's mentor, seventy-two year old Pete Harrigan, is one of the few people in the world whom Jake truly admires.  Pete retired from his job as a forensic anthropologist in New York City, and he is now a medical examiner in upstate New York.  Although Pete appears to be troubled and physically ill, Jake cannot find out what is tormenting his old friend.  All Pete will say is that he wants Jake to come up and examine some old bones that have been found at a local construction site.  Jake soon determines that the bones are human and that the skeletons may be the remains of homicide victims.  He enlists Manny's help in solving what turns out to be a decades old crime.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, there are people who do not want the truth about these old bones to surface, and when Jake and Manny dig into the past, they find themselves in danger.  As the plot plays out, there are burglaries, assaults, murder attempts, and quite a few twists and turns.  \\"Remains Silent\\" is a competently written and mildly humorous novel, and Jake and Manny generate some romantic sparks.  However, the novel goes downhill towards the end when Baden and Kenney come up with too many far-out revelations.  Overall, this is an average thriller in what promises to be an ongoing series featuring these two amateur sleuths.ur sleuths.	2005-08-16

Walker's detailed description of the logistical nightmares, the uncertainties, and the political maneuvering that took place during this pivotal time makes for a fascinating page turner.  Walker captures the terror, the conflicts, the determination, and the resourcefulness of the dozens of people involved in the Manhattan Project and its aftermath.<br /><br />Using lucid and vivid prose and even occasional dry humor, Walker takes us to the Trinity Test Site at Ground Zero in the desert of New Mexico.  There, J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team worked around the clock to prepare for the world's first nuclear bomb test.  Would the device explode or would it prove to be a dud?  If it worked, would the explosion destroy the entire state of New Mexico, or would the damage be localized?  There were no definite answers, because this project was both experimental and very dangerous.<br /><br />\\"Shockwave\\" also takes us inside Japan.  Walker describes the beautiful city of Hiroshima before the blast, with its busy entrepreneurs, its young and hopeful lovers, its verdant gardens, and its beleaguered and starving citizens frantically building weapons for the expected American invasion.  The author also explores the thinking of key Japanese leaders, including Hirohito and Togo, of President Harry Truman and his Secretary of War Henry Stimson, and even of Josef Stalin.  Was the bomb dropped for the sole purpose of ending the war and avoiding a catastrophic American invasion of the Japanese mainland?  Or was Truman anxious to use the bomb in order to make a statement about American might that would deter a future Soviet threat?  Walker explores all of these possibilities and lets the reader decide for himself.<br /><br />What brings this book to life is Walker's brilliant storytelling.  He puts the reader in the tower with Harvard-trained chemist Don Horing as he baby-sits the bomb prior to the test while a thunderstorm rages around him.  He places us in the desert with the observers after the world's first nuclear test. One general called it \\"stupendous, magnificent, and terrifying, an act of blasphemy in which puny man had dared tamper with the forces of the Almighty.\\"  We accompany Paul Tibbets in his B-29 bomber, the Enola Gay, as he and his crew fly over Hiroshima and prepare to drop their deadly cargo.  Finally, we are on the ground after the blast, the black radioactive rain falling to earth, the shockwave sucking up everything in its path, and the wretched victims either dying instantly or wishing that they had.<br /><br />Was the use of atomic weapons against civilians justifiable?  Truman and Tibbets claim never to have suffered a moment's doubt about the morality of using an atom bomb as a weapon of war on an entire city.  On the other hand, Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard convinced sixty-nine of his fellow scientists to sign a petition urging the president not to drop the bomb on Japan.  The petition was ignored.  Walker does not take sides; rather, he provides the reader with well-researched background information and a behind-the-scenes look at the personalities of the key individuals who played a part in this terrifying drama.  This riveting and unforgettable book demonstrates why the shockwave of Hiroshima is still being felt today and why it may never completely subside.ined chemist Don Horing as he baby-sits the bomb prior to the test while a thunderstorm rages around him.

Jasper Fforde's unique brand of inspired insanity makes \\"Something Rotten\\" a welcome addition to his enormously entertaining and often hilarious Thursday Next series. Thursday is the head of Jurisfiction, the policing agency that \\"safeguards the stability of the written word\\" in literature. However, she is tiring of her hectic, stressful, and often dangerous job and she needs a break. Thursday takes her two-year-old son, Friday, and decides to head for the Outland. She returns to her home town of Swindon, England, determined to bring back her \\"eradicated\\" husband, Landen Parke-Lane.<br /><br />Thursday's return home, unfortunately, brings a new set of problems to plague this beleaguered heroine. She is saddled with Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark, who is unhappy with the indecisive manner in which he has been portrayed by actors. In addition, the Council of Genres wants Thursday to do something about the dictatorial and ruthless Yorrick Kaine, an escaped fictionaut who is planning to dominate the world. To make matters worse, a mysterious and deadly assassin is out to get Thursday, and she has to watch her back constantly.<br /><br />\\"Something Rotten\\" is filled with puns, literary allusions, slapstick, dizzying time travel, ribald humor, naughty words, brilliant satire, and non-stop action. Often, the wacky plot makes little sense, and the many characters enter and exit so often that the unprepared reader may be left with a migraine. However, Fforde rewards the patient reader in many ways. The author entertains us with his large cast of colorful and varied characters. Thursday Next is an appealing heroine who is smart, courageous, warmhearted, determined, and resourceful. Melanie Bradshaw, the gorilla wife of Commander Bradshaw, provides Friday with much-needed child care in a pinch. Yorrick Kaine is Thursday's fearsome and frightening opponent, and his backers, the men behind the colossal Goliath Corporation, represent all of those reprehensible conglomerates that gleefully and heartlessly trample on human rights. Lady Emma Hamilton is a boarder who stays with Thursday's mom, and she proves to be a handful. Emma is a lush who has the hots for Hamlet. Colonel Next is Thursday's dad, and he travels through time, meeting up with and helping his daughter now and then. It is no accident that several characters from \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" also make key appearances in this whimsical and imaginative novel.<br /><br />Thursday's adventures are funny, poignant, and sometimes dazzling in their complexity. There is even a no-holds-barred \\"SuperHoop\\" croquet match that is as wild and unpredictable as the Quidditch matches in the Harry Potter novels. \\"Something Rotten\\" may confuse devotees of linear literature. However, if you like a creative and daring author who loves wordplay, creates timebending and mindbending escapades, and who inserts timely and pointed social commentary into his narrative, then you will find Jasper Fforde's \\"Something Rotten\\" as delightful as I did.hat gleefully and heartlessly trample on human rights.

Ayelet Waldman is in top form with \\"The Cradle Robbers,\\" her latest \\"Mommy-Track\\" mystery.  Los Angeles-based Juliet Applebaum is the harried mother of three young children, including a four-month-old baby girl whom she nurses day and night.  In another life, Juliet was a graduate of Harvard Law School and a federal public defender who routinely crushed lying witnesses with her aggressive cross-examination.  Now, she is a rumpled and exhausted mother who can barely keep her eyes open.  Juliet is filled with self-loathing, not just because she is a terrible housekeeper, but also because she neglects Peter, her long-suffering screenwriter husband.  To make matters worse, Juliet's job as a part-time investigator is far from lucrative.  Business is bad and promises to get no better anytime soon.<br /><br />As a favor to her office assistant, Juliet agrees to donate her time to a pro bono investigation.  It seems that several women who gave birth in prison had their babies taken away from them under false pretenses.  Juliet's investigation takes her behind prison walls, into junkies' apartments, and into the office of a church-based foster care agency known as the Lambs of the Lord.  During her interviews, Juliet often brings along her always hungry baby who somehow manages to poop at the most inopportune moments.<br /><br />\\"The Cradle Robbers\\" is a terrific entry in this entertaining series.  Juliet's witty wisecracks and satirical observations are funnier than ever. She ridicules everything, including her own ineptitude, her husband's weird work habits, and the shallow lifestyles of the upper class people who live in LA.  At the same time, Waldman has constructed a tight and poignant mystery about women in trouble who have no one to speak for them.  Juliet becomes their voice and she takes a stand, not just for these particular women, but also for the agonizing, exasperating, and glorious institution of motherhood.  At the same time, Juliet continues her valiant uphill struggle to balance the demands of work and family.<br /><br />Juliet Applebaum is a delightful protagonist whose experiences will resonate with every overworked mother who desperately needs a good night's sleep.  She is also a wonderfully humorous and compassionate heroine who is willing to stick her neck out to further the cause of justice.  \\"The Cradle Robbers\\" is an engrossing and beautifully crafted whodunit that will satisfy Waldman's loyal fans and undoubtedly earn her many new ones.uphill struggle to balance the demands of work and family.   <br /> <br />Juliet Applebaum is a delightful protagonist whose experiences will resonate with every overworked mother who desperately needs a good night's sleep.

Somehow, he manages to straighten himself out, and eventually graduates with honors from Princeton and the Wharton School.  After graduation, he gets a job on Wall Street and works his way up to the position of director at a prestigious investment banking firm.  Along with his high-paying job, Bolden has a beautiful girlfriend named Jenny whom he adores.  He also mentors high-risk teens in his spare time.<br /><br />One evening, Bolden's life changes forever when he and his girlfriend are attacked on the streets of Manhattan.  Bolden is kidnapped and interrogated, and when he does not answer his abductors' questions satisfactorily, he is nearly killed.  Although he manages to escape, Bolden is soon framed for murder, and is forced to go into hiding.  Throughout most of the novel, Bolden survives by his wits as he tries to figure out who is after him and why.<br /><br />\\"The Patriots Club\\" is about influential conspirators who work behind the scenes to manipulate politicians, the economy, and even the Pentagon. Although it starts out entertainingly enough, the story quickly loses any semblance of realism. Bolden has a superhuman ability to elude capture, even though both criminals and cops are on his tail.  The characters are one-dimensional, much of the dialogue is forced, and the plot is so convoluted that we need a scorecard to keep track of the myriad twists and turns.

Laura Joh Rowland's latest Sano Ichiro mystery, \\"The Assassin's Touch,\\" is exotic, suspenseful, and filled with political intrigue.  Sano Ichiro, formerly sosakan-sama, Most Honorable Investigator of Events, Situations, and People, has been promoted to chamberlain.  As the shogun's second-in-command, he is inundated with a mountain of paperwork and dull administrative duties.  When a rash of unexplained deaths among high-ranking government officials threatens the current regime, Sano is ordered to determine whether these officials were murdered, and if so, by whom.  Although he is relieved to be back in the field, Sano knows that if he fails in his mission, he may quickly lose his influence and most likely, his exalted position.<br /><br />Chamberlain Sano's wife, Lady Reiko, is a devoted mother to her young son, but she has an inquiring mind and a restless nature. She is not content to stay quietly at home, tending to domestic duties.  In the past, Reiko served as an unofficial private investigator for her husband.  However, now that Sano is an administrator, Reiko's services are no longer needed, and she is at loose ends.  Suddenly, a new opportunity for sleuthing presents itself when Reiko's father, Magistrate Ueda, urges his daughter to help determine the guilt or innocence of a woman named Yuago, who is accused of murdering her parents and sister.  Reiko rashly agrees to help the magistrate, not realizing that her decision will bring her much trouble and untold grief.<br /><br />\\"The Assassin's Touch\\" is colorful, action-packed, and fast-paced.  Sano and Reiko are appealing protagonists and Rowland populates her mystery with a large and fascinating cast of characters.  These include Lord Matsudaira, the shogun's cousin who controls the country while the slow-witted shogun wields power in name only.  Hirata, the man who inherited Sano's old position, is in constant agony from an old sword wound that crippled him for life.  Yet, when Sano asks his old friend to help him, the loyal retainer fights his excruciating pain and resolves to do his duty.  Yuago, whom Reiko is investigating, is an angry and violent woman hiding an explosive secret, and the assassin of the title is an elusive villain who is a practitioner of the mystical martial arts. Sano Ichiro faces a formidable and highly dangerous foe who can kill with a touch.<br /><br />There are a few weaknesses in \\"The Assassin's Touch,\\" such as the far-fetched coincidences that cause Reiko's and Sano's cases to unexpectedly merge.  In addition, the dialogue is a bit stilted and, at times, too contemporary for the time period.  Finally, the somewhat melodramatic ending requires a large suspension of disbelief. Still, Laura Joh Rowland is a gifted storyteller with a talent for writing atmospheric historical fiction. The author's wealth of descriptive detail brings seventeenth century Japan to brilliant life.  She shows the brutal and dark side of Edo at that time, with its courtesans, sadists, opportunists, and murderers, but she also features admirable characters who are courageous and unselfish.  Although \\"The Assassin's Touch\\" is not a perfect mystery, it is a lively, entertaining, and engrossing thriller that will please the many fans of this popular series.al retainer fights his excruciating pain and resolves to do his duty.

Runkel is a licensed family and marriage therapist and one of the founders of ScreamFree Living, Inc.  His thesis is that parents cannot keep tabs on their kids 24/7, nor can they force their children to consistently behave in a certain way.  Therefore, mothers and fathers would be better off learning to focus on how they react to their children's words and actions.<br /><br />Parents, Runkel contends, should take stock of themselves.  Are they in control of their behavior when they interact with their children?  Or are they at the mercy of their \\"emotional reactivity\\"--their unthinking, knee-jerk reactions?  If the latter is true, it is likely that parent-child interactions will be tense, angry, and unproductive.<br /><br />All of us who have struggled with parental responsibilities instinctively realize that a calm and reasoned approach is far more effective than a hysterical and dictatorial one. However, because of fatigue, ignorance, or inertia, many of us impulsively lash out, saying things that we don't really mean when our kids push our buttons.  What to do?<br /><br />Runkel does not advocate permissiveness.  Rather, he recommends what he calls \\"judo parenting.\\"  Judo is \\"the art of going with another's momentum.\\"  A ScreamFree parent facilitates rather than dictates; he encourages his children to use their own resources to solve problems. By helping kids to get in the habit of making their own decisions and living with the consequences, parents will be more likely to launch \\"self-directed\\" adults.<br /><br />The writing is clear, concise, humorous, and to-the-point.  \\"ScreamFree Parenting\\" is conveniently divided into easy-to-read sections and the chapters all conclude with thought-provoking \\"reflection questions.\\"  In addition, there are many practical examples that demonstrate how the principles discussed in the book work in the real world.  Runkel's amusing quotations from a wide variety of sources add liveliness to his message.  In additon, there are lengthier anecdotes that are taken from the author's experiences as a family therapist.  Most parents will pick up many useful tips from \\"ScreamFree Parenting.\\"  It is an entertaining, intelligent, and practical approach to raising our kids without losing our minds.unkel's amusing quotations from a wide variety of sources add liveliness to his message.

The author is a graduate of Yale Law, he has clerked for a Supreme Court Justice, and he is an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.  All of these experiences are woven into Roosevelt's hard-hitting story about the ways in which  wealthy and successful corporate lawyers handle their personal and professional problems.<br /><br />The firm of Morgan Siler is based in Washington, D. C., and its lawyers represent multibillion-dollar corporations.  Peter Morgan, the senior partner, has steered his late father's firm into such lucrative areas as bankruptcy and mergers.  Morgan is arrogant, self-centered, and ruthless, qualities that are highly prized in Morgan Siler's employees.  However, one associate, Mark Clayton, is a recent law school graduate who has not yet been corrupted by the system.  He inherits a troubling pro bono death penalty case that proves to be a trial by fire.  Morgan Siler is also defending a Texas company, Hubble Chemical, against a class action suit stemming from a fatal fire at a chemical plant where toxic chemicals were stored.<br /><br />Roosevelt's cast of characters is large and varied.  Besides the aforementioned Clayton and Morgan, other members of the firm are Walker Eliot, a brilliant third year associate who loves the law more in theory than in practice, Katja Phillips, a beautiful young idealist who is sickened by her colleagues' dirty tricks, and Ryan Grady, who would rather chase women than file briefs.<br /><br />\\"In the Shadow of the Law\\" gets high marks for its detailed depiction of the inner workings of a high-octane law firm.  Roosevelt realistically describes the pressures that corporate lawyers face.  Some of the members of Morgan Siler suffer from insomnia, fatigue, and stress-related ailments.  They often turn to alcohol to unwind, and because of their long hours at work, they have difficulty sustaining long-term personal relationships.  Divorce is more the norm than the exception.<br /><br />On the down side, this novel is a bit too long and repetitious; Roosevelt hammers home his theme about the immorality of corporate lawyers again and again.  In addition, the passages that deal with arcane case law may be difficult for the average reader to understand.  Roosevelt's writing is, at times, pretentious.  He is fond of using ten-dollar words such as \\"ineluctable,\\" \\"simulacrum,\\" and \\"carapace.\\" Finally, Roosevelt spends too much time recording the internal thoughts of his characters, who endlessly and tediously take stock of their narcissistic lives.<br /><br />Overall, however, \\"In the Shadow of the Law\\" is an intelligent, ambitious, satirical, and frightening look at how people who are sworn to uphold the law rationalize their perversion of the law.  A villain named Dick the Butcher in Shakespeare's \\"Henry VI, Part Two\\" said that \\"The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.\\"  After reading this scathing first novel by a promising young writer, one can almost sympathize with Dick's harsh words about the legal profession.and because of their long hours at work, they have difficulty sustaining long-term personal relationships.

The book is set in Leisure, Tennessee, at a secluded resort called \\"The Lodge.\\"  This location has been the scene of numerous murders and disappearances over the years.  One crime in particular has obsessed Quentin Hayes, a psychic and a member of the FBI's Special Crimes Unit, whose members use their extrasensory abilities as investigative tools. Hayes has spent a great deal of time over the years trying to find the killer of an eight-year-old girl named Missy; Quentin was a  guest at the resort when Missy was murdered, twenty-five years ago.<br /><br />Diana Brisco has recently arrived at the Lodge.  She is a troubled thirty-three year old woman who had been taking a variety of sedatives, antianxiety drugs, and antidepressants for over twenty years.  Her mother died when Diana was a young girl, and her father was alarmed by Diana's strange behavior, her blackouts, and her inability to concentrate.  However, Diana's doctor weaned her off all drugs a year ago, and after meeting with and talking to Quentin, Diana realizes that she has never been mentally ill.  She is a medium who can see and talk to the dead.  Fate brought her to the Lodge at the same time as Quentin because she is the only one who can speak for those who have already passed over to \\"the other side.\\"  With Quentin's help, Diana may be able to stop a vicious murderer from claiming any more victims.<br /><br />Hooper's simple and straightforward writing style contrasts nicely with the bizarre occurrences that gradually unfold throughout the book.  The author makes her fanciful plot work by underplaying the melodrama and presenting far out events in a matter-of-fact way.  She uses flashbacks and foreshadowing liberally to hint at the dangerous being that inhabits the Lodge, and she includes a number of red herrings to keep the reader in suspense. Diana is a sympathetic character and her relationship with Quentin develops gradually and realistically.

Harry is on high alert, because he has a suspicion that his fellow student, Draco Malfoy, is up to no good. However, Harry's friends think that he is becoming too obsessive and paranoid because of his loathing for Malfoy. Meanwhile, the Hogwarts routine continues, with Harry and his friends attending classes, playing Quidditch, and getting into assorted mischief.<br /><br />Rowling's brilliance shines through in \\"The Half-Blood Prince.\\" This book has it all: suspense and intrigue, a varied cast of fascinating characters, romantic triangles involving Harry and his friends, and a provocative ending that prepares the reader for the final installment in the series.

He uses the old \\"conspiracy theory\\" and \\"corruption in high places\\" formula and actually makes it fresh and compelling.  The protagonist is Justin (Jay) Westwood,  a cop in East End Harbor, Long Island.  When Jay's boss, police chief Jimmy Leggett, is killed in what appears to be a terrorist bombing of a local restaurant, the mayor appoints Jay to take Jimmy's place.<br /><br />Shortly after the bombing, a small plane crashes in East End Harbor.  Jay decides to investigate, but the pilot's body is quickly whisked away.  When Jay questions the authorities, he is stymied at every turn.  Being a good cop and a curious individual, Jay calls in favors from some friends of his, and he begins to put together the pieces of a mind-boggling conspiracy.  As witnesses are killed off one by one, Jay has a choice.  Should he play it safe and back off, or should he keep pressing for answers, even if doing so might cost him his life?<br /><br />\\"Midas\\" is a timely thriller that deals with issues in the news:  escalating oil prices, terrorism and the government's response to it, and the abuse of political power for personal gain.  Jay Westwood is an appealing, albeit flawed hero with his share of inner demons.  He is grieving over the tragic loss of his wife and child, and, more often than he'd like to admit, he anesthetizes himself with pot and booze in order to get to sleep.  Still, he has a core of inner strength and integrity, as well as a passion for justice; he is stubbornly unwilling to let important questions go unanswered.  When he is warned to stop investigating, Jay redoubles his efforts to get at the truth.<br /><br />Andrews has created a fascinating and varied cast of characters.  Bruno Pecozzi is an oversized hitman for the mob who, for some reason, is rather fond of the police chief.  A sexy cop named Regina Bokkenheuser joins the East End Harbor police force as Jay's assistant and she soon becomes indispensable, both professionally and personally.  Other memorable characters are Chuck Billings, an obsessive bomb expert who never takes a crime scene at face value, Hubbell Schrader, a vicious FBI agent, and Theresa Cooke, the jittery and terrified widow of the mysterious dead pilot.<br /><br />\\"Midas\\" is action-packed and fast-moving.  Andrews has woven a plot that is complex but comprehensible.  As Jay slowly sifts through dozens of clues and puts together the disparate elements of his case, he eventually realizes that he is up against people who can crush him instantly.  There is a particularly harrowing and well-written sequence in which the author describes Jay's incarceration under subhuman conditions.  The dialogue is sharp and realistic, the book has an internal logic that works throughout, and the novel concludes with some nifty surprises.  \\"Midas\\" is a suspenseful and engrossing story that effortlessly sweeps the reader along from beginning to end.nsable, both professionally and personally.

Mary Jane Clark's latest thriller, \\"Dancing in the Dark,\\" follows the same formula that has earned her a devoted following for years.  She picks an interesting location; this time, the setting is beautiful Ocean Grove, New Jersey.  Ocean Grove is both a mecca for tourists who love water sports and a place of historical interest.  Clark's attractive and admirable heroine is Diane Mayfield, a single parent by default.  Diane's husband, Phil, is a white collar criminal who is serving time at a federal correctional institution, leaving his wife to play the roles of mother, father, and breadwinner for their two children, Michelle and Anthony.<br /><br />Diane is forced to cancel a much anticipated family vacation to the Grand Canyon when, Joel, her boss at KEY news, orders her to cover a breaking story at the Jersey shore.  A young lady named Leslie Patterson has been found bound and gagged after disappearing for three days.  The police are convinced that Leslie staged her own abduction.  Joel wants Leslie to prepare a segment on \\"girls who cry wolf\\" for her newsmagazine show.<br /><br />Diane drags her reluctant children to Ocean Grove, and the story she has been sent to follow becomes more and more complicated.  Another girl goes missing and is subsequently found dead; there are a whole host of suspects who could be behind the abductions.  Among them are a mentally disturbed man, the boyfriend of the two victims, and a harried husband who has been quarreling more and more with his wife.  Red herrings pile up and the reader is kept guessing until Clark comes up with a truly surprising ending.<br /><br />\\"Dancing in the Dark\\" has brief chapters, spare writing, and sharply delineated characters, including an incompetent psychiatrist, a heartbroken real estate agent, and a woman who lives with her children in a tented community known as the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association.  Clark nicely integrates Ocean Grove's scenic setting into the narrative, and the story moves along at a fast clip.  One of the sad themes of the book is the epidemic of anorexia in Ocean Grove.  Young girls are starving and mutilating themselves in an effort to gain control of their lives and their inner pain.  Without trivializing this serious issue, Clark shows how difficult it is to treat these young women and what a tremendous toll their illness takes on their helpless families.  Another theme is the predatory nature of the media.  Whenever and wherever tragedy strikes, the television cameras start rolling.  \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" is an engrossing story by a talented author who knows how to keep her readers hooked until the final page.ry moves along at a fast clip.

Ford's new thriller, \\"No Man's Land,\\" gets off to a rip-roaring start.  In Arizona's maximum security Meza Azul penitentiary, a cunning prisoner named Timothy Driver manages to bypass the facility's state-of-the-art security features.  He takes over the prison, releases the inmates, and nabs 163 hostages.  Driver threatens to shoot one hostage every six hours until Frank Corso arrives at the scene.<br /><br />Corso is a journalist and a recluse who previously had written a book about Driver.  Members of the Coast Guard persuade a reluctant Corso to leaves his boat in Seattle and fly to Mesa Azul.  When he arrives at the prison, Corso quickly becomes a pawn in Driver's master plan. Meanwhile, an ambitious television journalist named Melanie Harris risks her already shaky marriage when she goes to Arizona to cover the story.  The slimy warden who runs Mesa Azul is more worried about his job than he is about the many lives that are at risk.<br /><br />Ford has a no-nonsense writing style laced with black humor, crisp dialogue, and first-rate descriptive passages.  Furthermore, the author effectively explores the predatory nature of the media, the randomness of fate, and the unspeakable conditions in America's prisons. However, the thriller's fatal flaw is that Frank Corso, who has always been savvy and tough when the chips are down, plays too limited a role in the proceedings. Although he shows great courage when confronting the volatile Driver, Frank is little more than a horrified spectator throughout most of the narrative.  In addition, there are too many scenes of excessive violence, and the novel's conclusion is chaotic and unfocused. In the past, Ford has proved that he is a talented writer, but \\"No Man's Land\\" is not one of his best efforts..the criminals. Although he shows great courage when he confronts the volatile Driver, throughout most of the novel, Frank is little more than a horrified spectator.  He also engages in a brief fling with Melanie that feels forced and artificial. There are too many scenes of excessive violence, and the conclusion is chaotic and unfocused.  Although Ford is a talented writer whose books I have enjoyed in the past, \\"No Man's Land\\" is one of the weaker entries in the Frank Corso series.	2005-07-20

By day, Dexter works as a blood spatter analyst with the Miami police department.  Under the light of the moon, Dexter listens to his inner voice, which impels him to track down people who commit terrible crimes without fear of punishment.  Dexter happily takes upon himself the triple roles of judge, jury, and executioner; he gleefully murders, dismembers, and disposes of his victims.<br /><br />However, Dexter is distracted when another monster, who makes Dexter look like Mother Teresa, takes center stage.  This sadist, known by the nickname of Dr. Danco, literally takes his victims apart, one limb at a time.  However, he keeps them alive to increase their suffering.  Dexter's foster sister, Deborah, is in danger of going crazy when Dr. Danco nabs her new lover, a federal agent named Kyle Chutsky.  She desperately turns to Dexter to save the day.  The police are basically out of the picture, leaving Dexter to nab Danco on his own.<br /><br />Other distractions are also throwing Dexter off his game.  First, he is trying to lose Sergeant Doakes of the Miami PD.  Doakes suspects that Dexter is a closet murderer, and the policeman shadows Dexter in an effort to catch him red-handed.  Second, in order to appear more normal, Dexter has been spending more and more time with his girlfriend, Rita, and her two kids, Astor and Cody.  Much to Dexter's shock, his relationship with Rita blossoms into something more than just a casual fling.<br /><br />As fond as I am of Dexter, I must point out that Lindsay's writing is a bit less sharp this time around.  The author makes some vague references to unsavory activities conducted in El Salvador to explain Dr. Danco's horrific deeds.  However, the plot is wafer thin, and the characters are as insubstantial as the story.<br /><br />Still, I recommend \\"Dearly Devoted Dexter\\" because of its dark, sardonic, and grotesque humor.  Dexter is a very funny narrator with an extremely sick mind. Although not all readers will appreciate the many dismemberment puns that permeate this novel, the strong of stomach will get a kick out of Lindsay's satirical send-off of formulaic serial killer books.<br /><br />Furthermore, \\"Dearly Devoted Dexter\\" is fast-paced and it features a nifty chase sequence as well as a hair-raising conclusion.  As an added bonus, Dexter may have found a young prot&eacute;g&eacute; to whom he can pass on his own life lessons, making Dexter a potential Mr. Rogers, albeit with homicidal tendencies.  \\"Dearly Devoted Dexter\\" is not your typical thriller, but it has an offbeat and wacky appeal, making it a worthy follow-up to Lindsay's terrific debut novel, \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter.\\"its dark, sardonic, and grotesque humor.

D., is the former chief medical examiner of Rockland County, a position that he held for thirty-three years.  In his book, \\"Dissecting Death,\\" Zugibe chooses the most noteworthy cases of his career to illustrate how forensic pathologists help prosecutors bring the perpretrators of violent crime to justice.  Forensic pathology, says Zugibe, \\"is as much the study of human ways and human life as it is the dissection of death.\\"<br /><br />Zugibe presents ten cases, each in a separate chapter.  He gives the particulars of each case and demonstrates how he used scientific methods to identify the body and gather clues about who might have committed the murder.  Zugibe points out that there is no clear cut and satisfactory solution to every crime.  For instance, when a reporter named John Sullivan went missing in El Salvador, the reporter's family wanted nothing more than to identify their loved one's remains.  Justice for this young man was never an option.<br /><br />Using clear and simple language, the author explains how forensic pathologists determine the approximate time of death,  why lividity in a corpse is significant, how the modern science of DNA testing has revolutionized our criminal justice system, and the ways in which forensic anthropologists gather crucial information by examining skeletal remains.<br /><br />Be forewarned.  \\"Dissecting Death\\" is a dark and, in many ways, depressing book, in which the author graphically describes the appearance and physical condition of decomposed bodies.  He also delves into forensic psychiatry, since many of the perpetrators who commit heinous crimes suffer from mental disorders.  There are black and white photographs in the center of the book that  illustrate some of the points made in the text.<br /><br />If you enjoy the television show, \\"CSI: Las Vegas,\\" this book will fascinate you.  When the author cracks a case using forensic entomology (the science that uses the knowledge of insects reproductive cycles, nesting habits, and eating patterns to solve homicides), I pictured Gil Grissom in his Las Vegas lab studying his collection of entomology texts and insect specimens.  Although all of the CSI programs are fictional and make liberal use of dramatic license, \\"Dissecting Death\\" shows that the science on which the programs are based is indeed used every day in forensic laboratories across the country.<br /><br />Zugibe's writing style is objective and matter-of-fact.  For some reason, he uses the present tense when describing crimes that happened years ago, a technique that I found artifical and a bit jarring. Zugibe also adds an unnecessarily sensational postscript at the end of the book in which he offers his opinion on two of the most controversial cases in recent memory--those involving JonBenet Ramsey and O. J. Simpson. However, the author deserves credit for skillfully breaking down complex scientific information into easily digestible snippets, so that even laymen will come away from this book with some basic knowledge of how forensic pathology works.<br /><br />\\"Dissecting Death\\" is not for the squeamish or faint of heart.  It is a hard-hitting and uncompromising look at the evil that men and women do to one another and the increasingly sophisticated methods that scientists are using to make sure that justice is done.cts reproductive cycles, nesting habits, and eating patterns to solve homicides), I pictured Gil Grissom in his Las Vegas lab studying his collection of entomology texts and insect specimens.

Kate White's deliciously titillating new novel, \\"Over Her Dead Body,\\" is about the murder of Mona Hodges, the dictatorial editor of \\"Buzz,\\" a weekly celebrity gossip magazine. White's heroine, Bailey Weggins, has just joined the \\"Buzz\\" staff.  Since her beat is celebrity crime, Bailey is assigned to cover this sensational story.  Not content merely to report the facts, she decides to do some sleuthing on her own.  Much to her chagrin, Bailey finds that the list of people who might have killed Mona could easily fill a small telephone book.  Mona insulted almost everyone she knew, and many individuals would have profited from her death.<br /><br />White is the editor in chief of \\"Cosmopolitan,\\" and her insider's take on the celebrity gossip business is hilariously satirical.  She depicts \\"Buzz\\" as a trashy publication whose writers cover such stories as the shocking secrets of the rich and famous, freaky beauty rituals, and the \\"binges, breakups, and botched plastic surgeries of the stars.\\"  The \\"Buzz\\" office is a very nasty place to work.  It is filled with backstabbing employees who are eager to get ahead, even at one another's expense.<br /><br />Who hated Mona Hodges?  One of the victim's many enemies is a portly singer named Kimberly Chance, whom Mona dubbed \\"Fat Chance\\" in the pages of her magazine.  Bailey's friend, Robby Hart, is also a prime suspect, since Mona unceremoniously fired him shortly before she was killed.  Other people who may have resented Mona are a publicist named Kiki Bodden, Tom Dicker, the pompous owner of \\"Buzz,\\" and Nash Nolan, the magazine's ambitious number two man.  The possibilities are dizzying.  When Bailey persists in her quest to find Mona's killer, she herself becomes a target for death.<br /><br />White captures the breezy vernacular of the hip urban professional in her cute, but not cutesy, dialogue, and her characters are both varied and well-drawn.  Bailey is savvy and sophisticated; yet, she displays a touching sweetness and vulnerability when an appealing new man named Beau Regan comes into her life.  \\"Over Her Dead Body\\" is suspenseful, engrossing, and well-crafted, and I liked White's restrained and fairly realistic ending.  Kate White tells it like it is; she describes the lurid world of gossip magazines with humor, style, and flair, and this mystery is an amusing and entertaining romp.appealing new man named Beau Regan comes into her life.  \\"Over Her Dead Body\\" is suspenseful, engrossing, and well-crafted, and I liked White's restrained and fairly realistic ending.

In \\"How Not to Write: the Essential Misrules of Grammar,\\" William Safire, nitpicker extraordinaire, wags his finger at sloppy writers.  Using large doses of gentle humor, Safire introduces \\"fumblerules,\\" mistakes that call attention to basic rules of grammar, usage, and style.  Safire, who warns us to avoid the overuse of alliteration, calls his compilation a \\"ferocious farrago of instructive error,\\" that is \\"designed to straighten you out without weighing you down.\\"  In fifty brief chapters, Safire wittily taps the reader on the shoulder, and, with a smile and a wink, he urges us to avoid such writing gremlins as run-ons, misplaced modifiers, mixed metaphors, and improper punctuation.<br /><br />This book offers little that is new for fussbudgets who already adhere to the basic rules of correct writing.  Most people who write for a living or as a hobby routinely avoid double negatives, always use commas and conjunctions with care, and would never allow too many cliches to clutter their prose.  For such readers, this book is not an instructional guide as much as it is an entertaining review.<br /><br />\\"How Not to Write\\" will serve as a useful introduction for novices who need to sharpen their writing skills.  They will learn the proper use of a semicolon, when to adopt a formal or colloquial writing style, and why euphemisms usually \\"deserve termination with extreme prejudice.\\"  This slim volume is not a textbook or a workbook.  There is no table of contents or index, and the chapters are not organized in any obvious manner.  \\"How Not to Write\\" is a painless and amusing primer by a Pulitzer Prize winner who writes a language column for the \\"New York Times.\\"  If you liked the bestselling book \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves,\\" you will also enjoy this lighthearted look at the rules of writing by one of America's most respected wordsmiths.	2005-07-17

The protagonist of Reed Arvin's \\"Blood of Angels\\" is Thomas Dennehy, a senior prosecutor in Davidson County, Tennessee.  Dennehy, who pops Zoloft to help him stay on an even emotional keel, has lived a lonely life since his wife divorced him.  However, he derives pleasure from his adorable eleven-year-old daughter, Jazz, whom he sees on weekends.  Although he gets a measure of satisfaction from putting bad guys away, his job as a prosecutor has taken a huge toll on him.  Dennehy is underpaid, overworked, and he spends too much time dealing with vicious criminals and the fallout of their crimes.<br /><br />Dennehy's friend and mentor, Carl Becker, is about to retire after putting in three decades as a respected prosecutor. Just before Carl's retirement party, the prosecutor's office gets some very bad news.  A professor from Georgetown University reveals that an incarcerated felon, Kwame Jamal, has confessed to a murder for which another man, Wilson Owens, was executed.  If the evidence proves that the wrong man was indeed sentenced to death, then Dennehy's career will be over and his office will be discredited.<br /><br />As if this were not enough to give him nightmares, Dennehy is about to try a politically sensitive case in which a Sudanese refugee named Moses Bol is accused of raping and murdering a white woman, Tamra Hartlett.  Tempers flare as Moses's Sudanese compatriots square off against the the victim's relatives and friends.  A female pastor and political activist named Fiona Towns takes Moses's side and does everything she can to throw a monkey wrench into Dennehy's case against Bol.  The prosecutor has his hands full coping with tremendous pressure from the media, the public, and the impassioned demonstrators on the both sides of the Bol case.<br /><br />Reed Arvin has written a timely, suspenseful, and compelling legal thriller about the stressful life of a principled man who wants to do the right thing.  Dennehy tells a group of third year law students, \\"Working for the DA's office is a passion, not just a career.\\"  He adds, \\"I get to set the balance of scales back to where they belong.\\"  Would that life were so simple.  By the time the Owens and Bol cases are resolved, not only is Dennehy's life threatened, but the people he cares about most also find themselves in the line of fire.<br /><br />\\"Blood of Angels\\" is a fast-paced and engrossing novel featuring realistic dialogue, nail-biting suspense, and many humorous moments that serve as welcome comic relief. Arvin gives his characters shading and depth.  Fiona is a beautiful, brainy, and idealistic woman who is willing to sacrifice herself to help the disenfranchised people of the world. Moses Bol is a proud, dignified, and desperate man; he has seen horrible injustice in his native land, and it is ironic that the \\"land of the free\\" has proven to be just another place where innocent people are tortured.  Thomas Dennehy is both committed to and repelled by his job, and he learns the hard way that truth and justice are elusive commodities.<br /><br />\\"Blood of Angels\\" is not perfect; the novel's conclusion relies on several shopworn plot devices.  Still, Arvin's story holds the reader's interest, and he reaches beyond the standard legal thriller formula.

Rain is a Japanese-American freelance assassin with a conscience; he will not kill women, children, or non-principals.  He specializes in making his hits look natural or accidental when the situation warrants it.  This time around, Rain is hired by two Israelis to take out Manheim Lavi, an Israeli national who has sold his bomb-making expertise to terrorists all over the world.  Although Rain has traditionally worked alone, he now has a partner, a former Marine sniper and comrade in arms named Dox.  Dox is a Southerner with a wicked sense of humor, who loosens up the normally severe Rain.<br /><br />When Rain's attack on Lavi fails spectacularly, the Israelis are furious, and they fear political reprisals against their country.  Rain himself becomes a target for assassination, and he soon reunites with Delilah, a sultry Israeli spy and former lover. However, Rain is not sure that he can trust Delilah, whose loyalties are divided.  Will she sell Rain out to her Israeli bosses or will she use her considerable skills to help him elude capture?<br /><br />\\"Killing Rain\\" is a wonderfully entertaining follow-up to the three previous John Rain novels.  Eisler constantly shows his characters developing and changing, and he emphasizes not just their fighting skills, but also their humanity and vulnerability.  When Rain is about to kill a man, and the man's son suddenly appears on the scene, Rain is paralyzed with indecision.  He cannot bear that a child will become fatherless because of his actions.  Rain's failure to carry out the hit puts a crimp in his reputation, and he has to struggle to prove himself still capable of doing the job.<br /><br />One of the most compelling aspects of Eisler's novels is the spycraft.  Eisler includes detailed and fascinating descriptions of how Rain conducts and eludes surveillance, plants and makes use of listening and video devices to keep tabs on a target, and even fools hotel employees into unwittingly revealing confidential information.  In addition, the author takes full advantage of his exotic locales, which include Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and the Philippines.  He makes each place come alive with colorful accounts of the its atmosphere, architecture, and  cuisine.<br /><br />Eisler's plot is deliciously complex and suspenseful, and the action scenes are nicely choreographed.  There is so much to like about \\"Killing Rain,\\" but I am especially impressed with Eisler's grasp of the terrifyingly irrational world in which we live--a place where people sell their souls for money and power, zealots routinely kill innocent people, and governments act against their own best interests.<br /><br />John Rain is not an easy man to categorize; he is both a hero and an antihero.  Rain can ruthlessly kill someone instantly with his bare hands, and he also has the cunning to outthink his most devious opponents.  However, he is having difficulty \\"bearing up under the weight\\" of what he has done.  Rain has given up a great deal for his profession--a family, a home, and peace of mind.  He has also learned the hard way that trust and compassion are rare commodities, and when he trusts someone or allows himself to care for another human being, he does so with great reluctance.  As Eisler shows in this superb novel, Rain is beginning to realize that the price he is paying for the life he leads may be too high.hotel employees into unwittingly revealing confidential information.

There is so much to like about \\"Killing Rain,\\" but I am especially impressed with Eisler's grasp of the terrifyingly irrational world in which we live--a place where people sell their souls for money and power, zealots routinely kill innocent people, and governments act against their own best interests.      John Rain is not an easy man to categorize; he is both a hero and an antihero.  Rain can ruthlessly kill someone instantly with his bare hands, and he also has the cunning to outthink his most devious opponents.  However, he is having difficulty \\"bearing up under the weight\\" of what he has done.  Rain has given up a great deal for his profession--a family, a home, and peace of mind.  He has also learned the hard way that trust and compassion are rare commodities, and when he trusts someone or allows himself to care for another human being, he does so with great reluctance.  As Eisler shows in this superb novel, Rain is beginning to realize that the price he is paying for the life he leads may be too high.	2005-07-10

Jodi Picoult's \\"Vanishing Acts\\" is the story of Delia Hopkins, a woman who suddenly discovers that her father, Andrew, abducted her when she was four years old. Delia's father took her from Arizona to New Hampshire, where they lived for the next twenty-eight years. This novel is told from a variety of perspectives; the interpretation of the same event depends on whose point of view you accept. Did Andrew kidnap his daughter because he resented Delia's mother? Or did he take Delia away because he loved her and wanted to keep her safe?<br /><br />Picoult analyzes her characters' innermost thoughts and emotions, admitting the reader into the secret corridors of their psyches. We learn of Delia's tremendous attachment to her father, who gave up his identity and his livelihood to start a new life with his daughter. In addition, we get a close look at Delia's ambivalent feelings towards her mother, Elise, who may be a victim, a villain, or both.<br /><br />In writing this book, Picoult undertook an ambitious task, but she doesn't quite pull it off. First, \\"Vanishing Acts\\" is far too long, and Picoult indulges in frequent passages of turgid descriptive writing such as, \\"I stumbled backward, the telephone line stretching like an umbilicus,\\" and \\"My mother's sorrow is so powerful, it cracks the clay tile beneath her feet.\\" Too many ill-conceived similes and metaphors call attention to the author's style and detract from the flow of the narrative. Picoult makes another major misstep when she devotes an inordinate number of pages to Andrew's horrifying experiences in jail. Picoult drops Delia's story for long stretches of time, while she examines Andrew's exposure to the hatred, drugs, and violence that are an everyday part of prison life. This section of the book is jarring and it doesn't mesh well with the rest of the story. The courtroom scenes are melodramatic and unrealistic, and there are too many dizzying subplots for one novel to comfortably contain.<br /><br />Picoult does effectively explore the unpredictability of life and the fallibility of childhood memories.  It is commendable that she presents no easy or facile answers to the troubling issues that she raises, such as the difficulty of trusting anyone, even oneself. Unfortunately, \\"Vanishing Acts\\" falls short because it is unfocused and overwritten.  Picoult has talent and a genuine feeling for family angst, but she could have used a skilled editor to streamline her work.re the unpredictability of life and the fallibility of childhood memories.

Thirty-two year old Samantha Kincaid, the protagonist of Alafair Burke's new thriller, \\"Close Case,\\" is the Deputy District Attorney for Multnomah County in Portland, Oregon, as well as the newest member of the Major Crimes Unit.  Although Sam loves her job and is very good at putting bad guys behind bars, she is often conflicted about how to behave in morally ambiguous situations. \\"Close Case\\" throws Sam into plenty of hot water, and she soon gets scalded.<br /><br />When black investigative reporter Percy Crenshaw is beaten to death outside his condo, Sam is asked to oversee the case.  Crenshaw had been driving an S-Class Mercedes Benz just before he was murdered.  Was he the victim of a carjacking gone wrong or did the killer have a personal vendetta against him?  Another high profile incident involves Delores Tompkins, an unarmed African American woman who was fatally shot through the windshield of her car by a Portland patrol officer.  Both cases are politically sensitive.  Sam's boss, District Attorney Duncan Griffith, is wary of the fallout from the media and civil rights groups.  To make matters worse for Sam, her live-in boyfriend, Detective Chuck Forbes, doesn't always agree with the way that Sam does her job.<br /><br />Alafair Burke's experience as a former deputy district attorney lends authenticity to this gritty and complicated police procedural.  She details the tough lives that district attorneys and cops lead, with the never-ending demands on their time, patience, and energy.  Sam is an engaging character, and her desire to follow her instincts and always do the right thing brings her into inevitable conflict with her supervisor and her boyfriend.<br /><br />The varied characters in the book include a courageous grass-roots activist, Selma Gooding, who knows more than she realizes about Crenshaw's death, Heidi Hatmaker, a rookie reporter who worked with Percy and would like to find his killer, and Lisa Lopez, an irritating defense attorney who gives Samantha heartburn.  There are plenty of suspects and red herrings to keep the reader guessing as to whodunit and why.  Burke's easygoing and often droll writing style and her deft characterizations add to the book's appeal.  My one quibble is the ending, which has far too many coincidences to be believed.  Still, \\"Close Case\\" is a suspenseful and engrossing thriller, and Burke gives her readers valuable insight into the workings of the criminal justice system.  She also demonstrates the difficulty that people of good conscience have when they seek justice in a corrupt world..

In Jack Kerley's new novel, \\"The Death Collectors,\\" Alabama Detectives Harry Nautilus and Carson Ryder are the recipients of the Mobile Police Department's \\"Officers of the Year\\" award. Nautilus and Ryder are the sole members of the MPD'S elite PSIT (Psychopathological and Sociopathological Investigative Team); they are considered to be experts on psychologically deranged serial killers. Ironically, this award is destined to bring these two men more grief than satisfaction.<br /><br />Nautilus and Ryder get to use their special skills when the exhumed body of a murdered woman is found in a seedy motel room surrounded by candles and flowers. Other dead bodies soon follow, and pieces of bizarre artwork connect these cases to a serial killer named Marsden Hexcamp. Hexcamp, who himself was killed over thirty years ago, was a self-proclaimed artist with a Manson-like following. Why is a dead man's artwork showing up now and how is it related to these new killings?<br /><br />Kerley's writing style is a mixture of black humor and hard-boiled detective-speak. The author vividly describes the beautiful Alabama coastal setting and he delineates his characters well. Besides the two leads, other notable personalities include DeeDee Danbury, a beautiful, cheeky, and aggressive television reporter, Jacob Willow, an elderly former Alabama detective who cracked the Hexcamp case in the early seventies, and Trey Forrier, a French artist who is incarcerated in the same mental institution as Jeremy, Carson's serial killer brother.<br /><br />Carson and Harry interview a motley crew of individuals, some of whom are known as \\"death collectors,\\" because of their penchant for collecting serial killer memorabilia. As they slowly gather clues, Carson and Harry realize that they will solve this case only when they unlock the secrets behind the life and death of Marsden Hexcamp.<br /><br />\\"The Death Collectors\\" is an engrossing look at the fascination that some outwardly normal people have with violent death. Ryder and Nautilus are up against a ruthless and insidious enemy, and their pursuit of this perpetrator places them in mortal danger. Kerley has written a well-constructed, fast-moving, and intriguing police procedural with fascinating twists and turns and an exciting and suspenseful conclusion.ople have with violent death.

After spending time in India and Japan, Holmes and his young wife set sail for San Francisco, California in 1924.  The ostensible reason for their visit is so that Mary can sign papers connected with the estate left by her parents, who died ten years earlier in a tragic car crash. However, Mary has an even more urgent motive for revisiting her childhood home.  She has been having disturbing nightmares, and she would like to exorcise the emotional demons that have been tormenting her.<br /><br />In the three years that she has been married, Mary has revealed few details about her childhood to her husband.  Her past is a confusing and frightening maze that she has been extremely reluctant to navigate.  Mary knows that her parents lived through the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, but why does she have no memory of being with them during that time?  Why does she blame herself for the accident that took the lives of her mother, father, and younger brother?  Finally, what is the significance of Mary's recurring dreams about flying objects, a faceless man, and a house with locked rooms to which only she has the key?<br /><br />Laurie King's novel addresses these and other questions against the backdrop of one of the world's most scenic cities.  The author's colorful and beautifully detailed descriptive writing brings Prohibition-era San Francisco to life, with its clanging cable cars, its wealthy mansions, and its breathtaking waterfront views.  \\"Locked Rooms\\" is a multi-layered and richly textured novel.  It is also a satisfying puzzle in which Russell uncovers some long buried family secrets and reexamines her assumptions about her parents' deaths.  King provides a close look at the inner workings of the Holmes' unconventional marriage.  In addition, \\"Locked Rooms\\" gives the reader a mini-history of the San Francisco earthquake, with a well-researched account of how this devastating event affected the city's traumatized residents.<br /><br />Readers will enjoy the book's deliciously complex plot as well as the large and diverse cast of characters.  Among them are Mary's childhood friend, Flo Greenfield, who has become a child of the jazz age, Tom Long, the son of the faithful Chinese couple who worked for Mary's parents, and the writer Dashiell Hammett, who helps Holmes with his sleuthing.  King uses an unusual narrative device that presents a dual perspective, both through Mary's eyes and the very different eyes of her husband.<br /><br />\\"Locked Rooms\\" has it all--an exotic locale, engrossing characters, fascinating historical background, and a suspenseful, well-told story.

Brad Thor's \\"Blowback\\" is an action-packed spy thriller about the complex world of international terrorism, biological warfare, religious fanaticism, and political corruption. The macho hero is Scot Harvath, a former SEAL who works for the Office of International Investigative Assistance in the Department of Homeland Security. He has repeatedly sacrificed his personal happiness and peace of mind in order to serve his country. Scott's archenemy is Khalid Sheik Alomari, a high-ranking al-Qaeda operative and ruthless assassin. Alomari has been traveling around the world killing Muslim scientists who may have unlocked the key to a devastating super weapon.<br /><br />This scenario plays out against the background of a vicious power struggle between an ambitious Democratic senator named Helen Carmichael and Republican President Jack Rutledge. Carmichael will do anything to unseat the popular president, and she has been secretly compiling damaging information about Rutledge in order to turn public opinion against him. Scott Harvath soon becomes Carmichael's pawn in her scheme to destroy President Rutledge.<br /><br />\\"Blowback\\" is timely story that is \\"ripped from the headlines,\\" with references to people and organizations that we read about in the news every day. Brad Thor provides well-researched and detailed background information about the Muslim world, and he explores the many ways in which the United States is battling the terrorist threat posed by radical fundamentalists. Scot Harvath's courage, knowledge of weaponry, and unerring instincts make him a worthy and appealing hero, and for a change, the author doesn't provide his protagonist with a love interest to distract him from his duties. Although Scot does have a beautiful and brainy partner, a molecular biologist named Dr. Jillian Alcott, his relationship with her is strictly platonic. Jillian provides the scientific expertise that Scot needs in order to fight a terrifying biological weapon that may soon be unleashed against the United States.<br /><br />At over four hundred pages, this novel is a bit too long. However, Thor keeps the narrative from dragging by shifting rapidly between characters in far-flung locales, such as France, England, Cyprus, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, and Washington, D. C.

Julia Spencer Fleming, in her new book, \\"To Darkness and to Death,\\" describes the terrible events that occur in a small Adirondack town when a conglomerate called Global Wood Products is poised to purchase thousands of acres of timberland.  Some residents of Millers Kill are resentful and angry about the sale.  They resort to desperate acts, including kidnapping, assault, and murder to express their frustration and to exact revenge against the people who have wronged them.<br /><br />The main characters are Clare Fergusson, an Episcopal priest, and Russ Van Alstyne, the Police Chief of Millers Kill.  Although Russ is married, he and Clare have deep feelings for one another that they try to keep hidden.  However, their mutual attraction has grown stronger with time, and the strain of pretending that they are platonic friends has become almost unbearable.<br /><br />Spencer-Fleming has created a rich mosaic of diverse individuals to populate Millers Kill.  Clare and Russ are compassionate and giving people whose self-respect and integrity prevents them from embarking on an extramarital affair. Eugene van der Hoeven is an emotionally and physically scarred recluse who stands to lose his beloved home if the land sale goes through.  Randy Schoof, a logger, is deeply in debt; he panics and behaves rashly when he realizes that he will undoubtedly lose his job in the near future.  The CEO of Reid-Gruyn Pulp and Paper mill, Shaun Reid, scrambles to prevent a hostile takeover of his company.  The lives of all these people intersect in bizarre and unpredictable ways before the final drama plays out in an explosive conclusion.<br /><br />\\"To Darkness and to Death\\" has an epic, universal quality.  This book is reminiscent of a mini-Greek tragedy, in which the characters destroy themselves and their loved ones because of their arrogance, greed, selfishness, and stupidity.  Spencer-Fleming captures the atmosphere of Millers Kill perfectly, contrasting the beauty of the area's scenic grandeur with the sick and ugly emotions that fester beneath the surface.  The novel reads quickly and the tension grows unbearably as the story progresses.  I wish that Spencer-Fleming had gone with a less busy ending.  Too many melodramatic events occur one after the other, weakening the book's believability.

Kathy Reichs latest thriller, \\"Cross Bones,\\" features forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance Brennan, who divides her time between laboratories in North Carolina and Montreal.  Tempe is currently in a committed relationship with hunky Canadian Detective Andrew Ryan (he of the Viking blue eyes), who is her partner both professionally and personally.<br /><br />When the body of an Orthodox Jew named Avram Ferris turns up in a state of advanced putrefaction in Montreal, Tempe is called in to help determine the cause of death.  Adding to the mystery, a stranger named Kessler passes Tempe a photograph, stating that it provides a clue as to why Ferris was killed.  The photo shows a supine skeleton, and various elements in the picture indicate that it was taken at an archaeological dig.  Tempe calls her pal, Jake Drum, a colleague at University of North Carolina-Charlotte and an expert in biblical archaeology, to shed some light on the photograph.<br /><br />Jake believes that the picture was taken at Masada, Israel, in 1963.  He further states that it may contain explosive evidence that Yigael Yadin, the archaeologist who excavated Masada, wanted to keep hidden from the world. Ferris' death and the puzzling photograph lead Tempe, Jake, and Ryan to Israel, where they encounter intrigue, violence, and ever more complex biblical conundrums involving skeletal remains.<br /><br />The resemblance between \\"Cross Bones\\" and Dan Brown's \\"Da Vinci Code\\" is strictly intentional. In fact, Tempe mentions Brown's blockbuster bestseller more than once, with a wink to the reader, as if the Reichs is saying, \\"Sure, this is another 'Da Vinci Code' clone, but I'm putting my own spin on it.\\"  Unfortunately, Reichs doesn't quite pull it off.  She populates her book with dozens of characters, including violent fanatics who want old bones to stay in the ground, Ferris's bereaved relatives, a corrupt Israeli antiquities official, and a priest with a deadly secret.  This book is so convoluted that Reichs is forced to spend many pages explaining the various plot points, and this slows the narrative down considerably.  It is obvious that the author has conducted extensive research about Masada and Jesus, and I applaud Reichs's scholarly attention to detail.  However, by the end of the novel, the lengthy explanations become a bit wearying and repetitious.<br /><br />Much of \\"Cross Bones\\" is formulaic.  As in most novels of this type, the heroine places herself in unnecessarily perilous situations more than once, and then scrambles to save her life.  There are frantic chase scenes, stilted, cutesy, and preachy dialogue, the obligatory twists and turns, excessive reliance on exclamation points and italics to grab the reader's attention, and, of course, a final violent confrontation.  The characters are devoid of any depth, and although the biblical riddles that Reichs offers are as intriguing as any of Dan Brown's, many more questions are raised than Reichs can ever satisfactorily answer.

Lisa Scottoline has made a very good living writing about spunky Italian women lawyers who fearlessly place themselves in dangerous situations.  In Scottoline's latest novel, \\"Devil's Corner,\\" the heroine, a prosecutor named Vicki Allegretti, is nearly killed during a shootout at the home of a confidential informant.  Tragically, her beloved partner and mentor, Morty, is shot to death.  Vicki decides that the police are not investigating Morty's death aggressively enough, and she decides to take matters into her own hands.<br /><br />Vicki's far-ranging inquiries take her to Devil's Corner, a run-down Philadelphia neighborhood riddled with addicts and crack dealers.  She interviews potential witnesses, follows suspects in her car, and teams up with a former adversary named Reheema Bristow, who is a tough, gorgeous, and street smart African American woman with major attitude.  She and Vicki become sistahs under the skin, and this aspect of the novel is both funny and poignant.  Reheema and Vicki are unwilling to back off until they find out the truth behind Morty's death, which involves political corruption, conspiracy, and a major cover-up.  I enjoyed the romantic angle in which Vicki longs to win the heart of Dan Malloy, a United States Attorney whose marriage may be on the rocks.  There is also Scottoline's patented subplot in which Vicki spars with her parents about her lifestyle and career choices.<br /><br />I have always liked Scottoline's down-to-earth ethnic humor as well as her descriptions of Philadelphia's colorful neighborhoods.  Her expertise shows when she explains the inner workings of police and prosecutorial procedures.  However, although \\"Devil's Corner\\" contains some solid elements, they do not make up for several serious deficits.  The plot of the novel is so complicated that I lost track of who did what to whom.  In addition, most of Scottoline's characters are not explored in any depth; there are many minor baddies who appear and disappear with dizzying frequency.<br /><br />\\"Devil's Corner,\\" at a bit under four hundred pages, goes on at least fifty pages too long.  Towards the latter part of the book, Vicki's \\"detective work\\" grows tiresome, and the cutesy dialogue becomes wearying.

The peripatetic Jack Reacher leaves Miami and a beautiful Norwegian woman behind to visit Indiana in \\"One Shot,\\" Lee Child's latest thriller.  While watching CNN, Reacher hears that James Barr, a forty-one year old Gulf War veteran and trained sniper, has been apprehended for shooting and killing five people in a public plaza.  Reacher served as a military policeman in the army for thirteen years, and he remembers Barr from an ugly incident in Kuwait City after Operation Desert Storm.  Although he had committed a serious crime, Barr escaped punishment because of political considerations that came into play.  Before Barr left the army, Reacher warned him to keep his nose clean for the rest of his life.  Now, Reacher is in Indiana to make sure that if Barr is guilty, this time he goes down for it.<br /><br />After looking into the particulars of James Barr's case,  Reacher is struck by the mountain of incontrovertible evidence that all points too neatly to Barr.  Soon, Reacher begins to suspect that James Barr may have been set up to take the fall for someone else.  Instead of bringing Barr down, Reacher proceeds to risk his life for an individual whom he once despised.  Jack Reacher is still the ultimate macho man, whose toughness is tempered by his sense of fairness, his compassion, and his unshakeable integrity.  He is also an expert at reconnaissance and a shrewd and tireless investigator.  Reacher's brute strength, his fighting skills, and his ability to outthink his opponents come in handy when he confronts his violent and ruthless adversaries.<br /><br />\\"One Shot\\" has all of the trademark touches that have made the British author, Lee Child, so popular in America.  The mystery elements are genuinely puzzling, and the way that Reacher finally puts all the pieces together is ingenious.  There is enough danger and intrigue to please the most diehard action-adventure fan.  Child knows guns, and whenever Reacher talks about weaponry, he does so with consummate authority.  In addition, the author's writing style is refreshingly crisp, clear, and fast-paced.<br /><br />The downside is that most of the characters are one-dimensional and the villains are downright cartoonish.  In addition, there are several plot elements that are too far-fetched even for a genre that is not meant to be realistic.

At first glance, David Lawrence's \\"Nothing Like the Night\\" resembles many other thrillers in which female victims are horribly mutilated and murdered by a psychopathic predator. The central character is DS Stella Mooney, a tough female detective based in London.  During the day, Stella performs her job with fearless aggression.  However, she is plagued by frequent and unsettling nightmares, and she has been drinking too much in an effort to turn off her disturbing thoughts.  Even though she has had a live-in lover for six years, Stella is strongly attracted to a principled and compassionate journalist named John Delaney.  Helping Stella to sort out her conflicting emotions is Anne Beaumont, Stella's insightful therapist, who also serves as a criminal profiler for the police.<br /><br />Mooney is called to the scene when a former fashion model named Janis Parker is found dead, her throat slashed and her body covered with cuts.  Stella and her team follow up all available leads, but they come up empty.  When more victims turn up, it becomes apparent that a serial killer is loose in London.  The police are anxious to find out how the killer chooses his victims, and since there are no signs of forced entry, why the victims let him into their flats.  As time goes by with little progress being made, Mooney and her team become increasingly frustrated by their inability to solve the crimes.<br /><br />\\"Nothing Like the Night\\" stands out because of David Lawrence's hard-hitting, gritty, and uncompromising writing style.  The dialogue is sharp and realistic, and the author takes the time to capture the nuances of each character's personality.  In the course of the novel, Lawrence thoroughly explores the underbelly of London society.  Figuring in the plot are drug dealers and addicts, women who sell their bodies on the street or in strip clubs, a street urchin who lives in a cemetery, and dangerous thugs who kill at the drop of a hat.

Reclusive Lew Fonesca needs closure, but he is in \\"Denial,\\" which is the name of Stuart Kaminsky's new murder mystery.  Lew was devastated when, four years earlier, his beloved wife Catherine was run down and killed by a hit and run driver who was never apprehended.  Overcome with grief, Lew abruptly left Chicago and moved to a dumpy apartment in Sarasota, Florida.  He now ekes out a bare bones living as a process server, subsists on fast food, showers in the Y, and watches old movies on video.<br /><br />Like Greta Garbo, Lew claims to want to be left alone, yet somehow he has accumulated a host of friends and acquaintances who care about him.  These include eighty-year-old Ann Horowitz, Lew's therapist, Sally, a caseworker with whom he has kept company for three years, and seventy-four year old Ames McKinney, a gun-toting six-foot-four enforcer who gives Fonseca much needed muscle when he inevitably gets into trouble.<br /><br />Lew was an investigator in Chicago, and he hasn't lost his touch.  In \\"Denial,\\" he takes on two new clients.  One is an elderly woman named Dorothy Cgnozic, who swears that she witnessed a murder in Seaside Assisted Living, a facility for senior citizens.  The Seaside staff scornfully dismisses Dorothy's allegations, so she hires Lew to prove that \\"she is not a demented old woman.\\"  Lew's other client is Nancy Root, a divorced actress whose fourteen-year-old son, Kyle, was killed by a hit-and-run driver.  Lew takes on the second case reluctantly, because it reminds him too much of the tragedy that robbed him of his wife.  When Lew looks into Nancy's eyes, he sees a heartrending grief that mirrors his own.<br /><br />Kaminsky has a laid back, dryly humorous, bare bones style of writing.  Lew is a deliciously sarcastic narrator.  When Fonesca shakes hands with a strong and formidable woman, he states,  \\"She had a grip that could crack walnuts.\\"  The cast of characters includes the quirkiest bunch of individuals that you are likely to meet in any murder mystery.  There is even an alligator named Jerry Lee, who is the unofficial mascot of one of the residents in the Seaside Assisted Living facility.<br /><br />\\"Denial\\" is more whimsical than realistic.  The two murder mysteries in the book are not exactly classic whodunits, nor are the solutions to the crimes particularly logical.  However, the plot is engrossing enough, and Lew proves to be a dogged and skilled investigator.  The novel is most noteworthy, however, not for the mystery elements, but for the insightful way that Kaminsky portrays the walking wounded.  The criminals in this book are ordinary individuals who are hurting, so they lash out at others, making self-destructive choices that ultimately lead to their downfall. In Lew's case, however, there is hope.  With the help of his wise therapist, Lew has begun to take his first tentative steps towards escaping the prison that he has so laboriously built around himself.  \\"Denial\\" is a poignant novel that will entertain Lew Fonesca fans and may even gain some new readers for the talented Stuart Kaminsky.There is even an alligator named Jerry Lee, who is the unofficial mascot of one of the residents in the Seaside Assisted Living facility.      \\"Denial\\" is more whimsical than realistic.

The eloquent narrator, Eric Moore, owns a camera and photo shop and photography is a motif that permeates the novel.  Snapshots capture people at particular moments in their lives, but it is impossible to look at pictures and really know what lies behind the posed smiles.<br /><br />\\"Red Leaves\\" is the story not just of Eric Moore, but of his dead mother and bitter father, his shiftless brother, Warren, his wife, Meredith, and his son, Keith.  By the end of the novel, Eric has ample reason to reevaluate everything that he has assumed about each one of these individuals.  He achieves \\"the high wisdom that only the fallen know\\" the hard way, through bitter experience.<br /><br />Eric, Meredith, and fifteen-year-old Keith live in a beautiful home in a small town, and life is good.  Meredith has a job she adores, teaching English and handling administrative duties in a local junior college.  One Friday evening, Keith is asked to baby-sit for eight-year-old Amy Giordano.  He agrees and everyone's lives change.  The next morning, Amy is not in her bed, and her parents are crazy with worry.  Who abducted their little girl?  Is she still alive?  Since Keith was apparently the last person to see her, suspicion naturally falls on him.  The police are particularly interested in the fact that Keith is a reserved and awkward boy with few friends and low self-esteem.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Cook maintains a high level of suspense, using foreshadowing and opening each section of the book with cryptic comments by the narrator made after the events of this novel have already taken place.  Therefore, \\"Red Leaves\\" is in the nature of a jigsaw puzzle, whose pieces can be put together only after the last page is turned.<br /><br />The story derives its power from Cook's marvelously descriptive writing and his careful delineation of character.  The book's themes are universal: no one is exactly as he or she appears on the surface, suspicion can be corrosive, and happiness is a fragile state that too often dissipates without warning.  Cook also demonstrates that, for better or worse, each of us is a product of our particular family history.<br /><br />Although Eric's life seems stable, an unpredictable combination of circumstances turns everything he values to ashes.  \\"Red Leaves\\" suffers from a melodramatic ending that I wish had been a bit more restrained, but it is still a compelling and unforgettable work about a family's tragic disintegration.is exactly as he or she appears on the surface, suspicion can be corrosive, and happiness is a fragile state that too often dissipates without warning.

William Gibson's \\"The Miracle Worker\\" is as poignant and powerful today as it was back in 1957, when it was first performed on \\"Playhouse 90.\\"  Annie Sullivan is an \\"inexperienced half-blind Yankee schoolgirl\\" who attempts to reach seven-year-old Helen Keller, a child who became deaf and blind as a result of a childhood illness.  Helen's father, Captain Keller, is a southern gentleman who is used to being obeyed.  However, even he stands helplessly by in the face of Helen's violent and disruptive outbursts.  Mrs. Keller, Helen's mother, is a sweet and loving person who pities Helen, and by giving in to her every whim, she helps turn her daughter into a demanding tyrant.<br /><br />Annie Sullivan is only twenty when she comes to Alabama to become Helen's teacher.  Annie had been blind herself, and although numerous operations on her eyes have restored some of her sight, her eyes remain weak and sensitive to light.  Annie is appalled when she meets her volatile and undisciplined charge.  The teacher sets out to civilize Helen by instructing her to eat from her own plate with utensils rather than grab food from everyone else's plate with her hands.  This leads to an angry confrontation between teacher and student, which leaves both of them emotionally and physically drained.  William Gibson's five page long stage directions describe in great detail this pitched battle between these two stubborn individuals.  After this harrowing encounter, Annie realizes that only by separating Helen from her indulgent family can she ever hope to tame this brilliant but willful youngster.<br /><br />\\"The Miracle Worker\\" is a beautifully constructed and concise play.  Each act builds in intensity until the climactic scene when Helen associates the water that pours over her hands with the letters that Annie is constantly spelling into her palm.  However, this drama is more than a heartwarming story about a dedicated teacher and her out-of-control student.  It is a story about a family divided against itself.  Captain Keller is an overbearing husband and father, Mrs. Keller is a mother in denial, and Helen's half-brother, James, never gets enough positive attention from his parents.<br /><br />Gibson injects welcome humor into the play, as when Annie proclaims, \\"What good will your pity do her [Helen] when you're under the strawberries, Captain Keller?\\"  In addition, Annie criticizes the family for treating Helen like a pet, adding sardonically, \\"Why, even a dog you housebreak.\\"  Some of the most resonant lines in \\"The Miracle Worker\\" deal with the importance of communication.  Annie wisely observes, \\"Language is to the mind more than light is to the eye.\\"  If Helen is to ever function as an adult, she will need to learn sign language.  To accomplish this, Annie seeks a breakthrough that will enable her to bring Helen's spirited soul out of the darkness of her isolation.  When Annie drags Helen to a water pump to refill a pitcher she had dropped, Helen says, \\"Wah. Wah,\\" remembering the word for water from babyhood.  After the realization dawns on Helen that words stand for objects, Annie senses that, in the future, there will be no stopping this bright young woman from soaring as far as her lively mind will take her.self.

David Rosenfelt's \\"Sudden Death\\" features Andy Carpenter, a wisecracking defense attorney who has taken on a high profile case.  Kenny Schilling, a star running back for the New York Giants, has barricaded himself in his house with the dead body of another football player, Troy Preston.  Kenny claims that someone else killed Troy and left him to take the rap.  After arranging for Kenny's surrender, Andy agrees to defend him, and the battle is straight uphill.<br /><br />Andy is the first person narrator and he is a sweet and funny guy, similar to Ben Kincaid in the early William Bernhardt books.  Unlike Ben, Andy is a multimillionaire who doesn't need to work for a living.  Andy's lover, Laurie, is also his investigator, but she is seriously thinking about returning to the small Wisconsin town where she grew up.  Andy loves his home in Paterson, New Jersey, and moving to Wisconsin is not an option for him. He spends much of the book worrying that he will lose Laurie.<br /><br />\\"Sudden Death\\" features nasty mobsters, courtroom wrangling, media hype, and, on every page, Andy's one-liners.  Rosenfelt has a gift for spare writing and deft characterization.  Marcus, Andy's fierce bodyguard, who grunts rather than speaks, can frighten the most hardened criminal with his stony stare.  Tara, Andy's beloved golden retriever, would be the one true love of his life were it not for Laurie. Edna, Andy's secretary, sidles in to work when she feels like it; her true passion is crossword puzzles.  \\"Edna is to crossword puzzles what Gretzky was to hockey.\\"<br /><br />As the case against Kenny becomes more watertight, Andy digs into his bag of tricks to cast suspicion on some nasty New Jersey gangland types.  This would be a brilliant idea, except for the fact that Andy is quickly targeted for death.  Rosenfelt's ending is both far-fetched and predictable, but \\"Sudden Death\\" is so entertaining that it scarcely matters.

Michael Connelly scores again with \\"The Closers,\\" a superb entry in the Harry Bosch series. For the uninitiated, Harry is a retired Los Angeles homicide detective who has a reputation for cutting corners in order to nail a suspect. He is highly intelligent, gruff, and politically unwise. Harry misses his old job, so he comes out of retirement to work with his former partner, Kiz Rider, in the Open-Unsolved Unit. His mission is to bring \\"new hope for the dead\\" by revisiting cold cases and trying to clear them. Just like baseball pitchers who are brought in to save a game in the late innings, the \\"closers\\" are the last resort for homicide victims whose cases have long been dormant.<br /><br />In 1988, a sixteen-year-old girl named Becky Verloren was attacked with a stun gun in the bedroom of her home, carried up a hill, and shot dead. Harry and Kiz study the murder book containing the details of the investigation, and they conclude that Garcia and Green, the original detectives looking into Becky's death, made some critical mistakes.  However, this cold case has suddenly heated up, because DNA evidence from the gun that killed Becky has been matched to a small time thug named Roland Mackey. Rider and Bosch follow up their most promising leads, and they interview anyone who knew Becky or who may have information relevant to her death.  With the incredible advances in forensic technology, and with the benefit of a fresh perspective, Harry and Kiz hope to put Becky's killer behind bars.<br /><br />\\"The Closers\\" is a marvelously constructed crime novel in which all of the elements come together like clockwork. The intricate plot is involving and suspenseful and Connelly laces his crisp and realistic dialogue with colorful police jargon. Besides the inimitable Harry Bosch and Kiz Rider, the most memorable characters are Becky's emotionally shattered parents, Muriel and Robert Verloren, and a corrupt deputy police chief who threatens to destroy Harry before Harry destroys him.<br /><br />The author's detailed depiction of Harry's daily schedule brings home how difficult a homicide detective's job really is. Suffering from inadequate sleep and eating his meals on the run, Harry makes countless phone calls, handles prickly reporters and demanding supervisors, spends hours studying and writing reports, does his best to console grieving relatives, and somehow finds a way to live with the terrible knowledge of what one human being can do to another. Even when he solves a case, Harry is often depressed, since there are usually no happy endings for the victims of homicide. \\"The Closers\\" is an outstanding crime novel, one of the best of 2005. It is also a study of the dark side of human nature, the temptations that lead people astray, and the dogged and selfless determination of cops like Harry Bosch \\"to always speak for the chorus of forgotten voices.\\"hor's detailed depiction of Harry's daily schedule brings home how difficult a homicide detective's job really is.

Robin Cook's \\"Marker\\" is another entry in his series featuring two New York City medical examiners, Laurie Montgomery and Jack Stapleton. Laurie and Jack are lovers as well as colleagues, but their relationship may end because of Jack's unwillingness to make a permanent commitment. Laurie is further distracted by a series of cases in which seemingly healthy young people die overnight in the hospital. All of the victims were recovering from routine elective surgery and none was particularly sick. The autopsies and toxicological screens reveal nothing. Laurie instinctively suspects foul play, but she cannot convince her supervisors that she is right.  Therefore, she takes matters into her own hands.  She tries to figure out what all of the victims had in common, as well as who might have had both the motive and the opportunity to commit murder.<br /><br />\\"Marker\\" is Robin Cook's twenty-fifth novel and it follows a familiar formula. Jack and Laurie are attractive, brilliant, and dedicated physicians. There is a large managed care health company that may be up to no good. Cook throws in a psychotic killer, as well as a few soap opera elements involving a love triangle and a possible pregnancy.<br /><br />Cook's writing style is pedestrian. His characters are one-dimensional and his dialogue is stilted and, at times, laughable. Since he eschews profanity, Cook frequently has his characters uttering such exclamations as \\"My word!\\" \\"Good grief!\\" and \\"Shucks!\\" Since Cook lets us know the killer's identity early on, there is little suspense on that score.<br /><br />Cook explains arcane medical details clearly. Unfortunately, his depiction of romantic relationships is forced and his action sequences are both strained and artificial. This five hundred plus page novel moves along quickly enough and there are a few tense moments. However, only an incredibly undemanding reader would liken \\"Marker\\" to the best of Cook's earlier books, such as \\"Coma\\" and \\"Sphinx,\\" which were genuinely scary and engrossing.ere genuinely scary and engrossing.	2005-05-26

In addition, Jordan and her colleagues are still looking for the perp who abducted and presumably killed two young boys whose bodies have never been found.<br /><br />Jordan and Hill have plenty of personal demons to exorcise.  Jordan was raped during an undercover sting that went wrong, and she has been gun shy about returning to police work since that horrible event left her in shock.

She knows that everyone is waiting to see if she is still up to the job intellectually and emotionally, and she is determined to prove her mettle.  The two high-profile cases that she is investigating will test her powers of concentration, her patience, and her ability to command.  To make matters worse, there is very little forensic evidence in either case that might lead to quick arrests.<br /><br />Val McDermid is one of the undisputed masters of the British police procedural.  She puts us in the incident room with the detectives, and she makes us feel the pressure that the detectives experience as they fan out to conduct endless interviews, most of which end up giving them \\"no joy.\\"  As the bodies of victims pile up with no suspects in sight, Carol and her team begin to believe that their adversary, the unknown serial killer, is too smart and/or too lucky to get caught.  When her boss suggests putting one of Carol's officers on the street posing as a prostitute to attract the killer, Carol is reluctant to go along; after all, she was once asked to act as a decoy by her superiors, with tragic results.  Can she, in good conscience, allow one of her own officers to take such a chance?<br /><br />\\"The Torment of Others\\" is a powerful story of psychological terror. Carol's fears, Tony Hill's weird empathy with the \\"nutters\\" whom he treats, and the perverse forces that plague each individual, whether cop or criminal, are depicted with depth, insight, and frightening detail.  The novel is genuinely scary at times, and the ending is both tense and brutal.  Val McDermid pulls no punches; she is not afraid to go over to the dark side in her fiction.

Isabel Allende's enchanting new novel, \\"Zorro,\\" traces the origins of the legendary folk hero, who evolved from a privileged and foolish young man into an intrepid warrior.  Zorro's mission was to use his wits, agility, and formidable fighting skills to defend the poor and downtrodden in early nineteenth century Spain and California.  Allende laces her narrative liberally with humor, irony, wit, and dozens of colorful characters.<br /><br />The story begins with the birth of Zorro's alter ego, Diego de la Vega, in Alta California.  We follow Diego to Barcelona, Spain, where he changes from a playful and callow youth into a passionate young man.  The author enlivens her story with intrigue, sword fights, romance, treachery, adventures on the high seas, prison breaks, and fascinating historical background about the relationship between the Native Americans, the Spaniards, the French, and the Catholic Church during those turbulent times.  There is never a dull moment in this nearly four hundred page book, and the translation from the Spanish by Margaret Sayers Peden is excellent.<br /><br />Without compromising the spirit of fun that permeates her tale, Allende makes it clear that the Indians in North America were victims of genocide. The Spanish conquerors came to the New World, greedy for land and treasure, and they murdered the Indians, burned their villages, and enslaved those who survived.  Allende creates a number of unforgettable Native American characters.  Bernardo, Diego's devoted \\"milk brother,\\" becomes mute after his mother is brutally assaulted; White Owl, Diego's grandmother, is a respected shaman and medicinal healer who teaches her grandson to be faithful to his spiritual guide, the fox; and Toypurnia, Diego's mother, is a fierce warrior who cannot be tamed, even by the love of the handsome hidalgo, Alejandro de la Vega.<br /><br />\\"Zorro\\" works so well because Allende goes back to storytelling basics.  She puts interesting people in exotic settings, and she has them contend with nasty villains who will stop at nothing to get what they want.  Finally, she features a brave, albeit flawed hero, who risks his life, with panache and style, to fight for justice.  If this sounds like a Spanish \\"Star Wars,\\" that's not far off the mark.  Although the characters, the setting, and the time frames may vary, well-told stories about the battle of good versus evil will always find a place in people's hearts.d with nasty villains who will stop at nothing to get what they want.

St. Louis Attorney David Hirsch is the protagonist of \\"The Mourning Sexton,\\" a thoughtful, touching, and suspenseful legal thriller. Hirsch has it all--a privileged childhood, a degree from Harvard Law School, a job in a prestigious firm, a wife, and two beautiful daughters. What does he do with all his bounty? He embezzles money, sleeps around, uses cocaine and alcohol liberally, and ends up serving seven years in Allenwood, a federal penitentiary. Upon his release, David has nothing--no family, no job, and no friends, except for his old pal, fellow attorney Seymour Rosenbloom.<br /><br />David starts to rebuild his life slowly. He resumes practicing law under strict guidelines outlined by the Missouri Supreme Court. He also starts to attend synagogue, where he is known as the \\"mourning sexton,\\" since it is his job to lead the elderly congregation in the saying of \\"kaddish,\\" the prayer for the dead. When one of his fellow congregants, Abe Shifrin, asks David to look into the death of Abe's daughter, Judith, David is reluctant to get involved. Judith was a lawyer who died in a car accident three years earlier; it seems pointless to take action now. However, to please the old man, David files a wrongful death suit on Abe's behalf. While investigating the facts surrounding Judith's death, David is horrified to discover that this young woman may have been murdered.<br /><br />David Hirsch is a terrific character. He is a man who threw away everything that was important to him, and instead of being bitter about it, he willingly takes the punishment that he knows he deserves. However, contact with some good people, including a rabbi in prison, has given David a glimmer of what he could be. His duties as a sexton in synagogue, his relationship with Seymour, who stood by him when no one else would, and his involvement in Judith's case all bring David a sense of purpose. He decides that there are certain things in life worth fighting for--among them, family, friends, justice, and self-respect.<br /><br />Michael Baron's plot has some familiar elements, such as legal corruption, greed, and murder for hire.

Buffa's latest legal thriller, \\"Trial by Fire,\\" features criminal defense attorney extraordinaire Joseph Antonelli. Julian Sinclair, a brilliant and distinguished law professor, is arrested for the murder of Daphne McMillan, an Assistant District Attorney in San Francisco. Sinclair asks Antonelli to defend him, and without hesitation, Joseph takes the case.  He likes and admires Sinclair, and he is certain that his client is innocent.  Unfortunately, the media and public opinion quickly turn against Sinclair, and Joseph soon realizes that his chances of winning an acquittal are slim.<br /><br />Buffa's central theme is the destructive role that newspapers and television play in high profile cases.  In order to boost circulation and inflate ratings, broadcast and print journalists often make inflammatory and prejudicial statements, caring little that their words and actions may influence potential jurors and make a fair trial all but impossible.<br /><br />The courtroom scenes are excellent and I enjoyed the give and take of the cross examinations, as well as the eloquence of the attorneys' arguments.  Joseph Antonelli is an engrossing narrator and an admirable protagonist. He is a man of integrity who is unpretentious, hard-working, and very creative and clever in the courtroom.  To his credit, the author doesn't clutter his book with unnecessary gore, shallow romances, or silly chase scenes.  He focuses on the law, on personalities, and how difficult it is to obtain justice in our society.<br /><br />The novel has its weaknesses as well.  Some of the characters in this book are a bit too one dimensional, and Buffa strains his plot to the breaking point in an effort to come up with a surprise ending.  In addition, he writes quite a few passages and lines of dialogue that sound artificial.  In spite of these flaws, the story of Julian Sinclair held my interest, and whenever Antonelli speaks about the law with intelligence, insight, and passion, he commands the reader's undivided attention.ention.	2005-05-09

Neil Olson's debut thriller, \\"The Icon,\\" is another offshoot of the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" mania that has swept the world.  An ancient and beautiful Greek icon, the Holy Mother of Katirini, is believed by some to have mystical healing powers.  This object drives men to steal, lie, betray their friends, and even murder one another to possess it.  The action shifts back and forth from Epiros, Greece, during World War II to New York City in the year 2000.<br /><br />Matthew Spear, whose name is derived from the Greek Spyridis, is an assistant curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  His grandfather, Andreas Spyridis and his godfather, Fotis Dragoumis, both fought in Epiros against the Germans and, for some reason, there is bad blood between these two former comrades.  Andreas and Fotis have never told Matthew the whole truth about their sordid and shameful actions during the war.<br /><br />Their lives are changed forever when the icon of the Holy Mother goes on the market after the death of its owner, an old man named Kessler.  His lovely granddaughter, Ana Kessler, consults Matthew, wondering whether she should sell the icon to the Greek Church or to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Alas, her plans go awry when various individuals resort to subterfuge and violence to get their hands on the icon.<br /><br />Olson does a workmanlike job of setting up the historical context of his story. The author provides interesting background information concerning the murky political situation in Greece during the German occupation.  Communists, republicans, royalists, German collaborators, and black marketeers, among others, struggled to survive during those terrible times.  Matthew's grandfather was among those who fought valiantly to protect their homeland, their families, and their way of life from the invaders.<br /><br />When he shifts to the present day, however, Olson falters.  He would have us believe that men in their late eighties and even their nineties, including a former Nazi, would have the strength and the desire to hatch and execute elaborate schemes in order to acquire the icon, no matter who gets hurt in the process.  Matthew is dragged into the whole mess against his will.  He is an intelligent and good-hearted character who falls under the spell of both the icon and Ana Kessler.  By the time all of the smoke clears, and after much blood is shed, Olson wraps things up predictably.  We learn once again that no work of art, however beautiful and meaningful, is worth the price of people's lives.th and the desire to hatch and execute elaborate schemes in order to acquire the icon, no matter who gets hurt in the process.

Will Thomas continues his winning streak in \\"To Kingdom Come,\\" a wonderfully entertaining and well-researched mystery featuring Cyrus Barker and his young Welsh assistant, Thomas Llewelyn. Mr. Gladstone is the Prime Minister of England and the Irish are clamoring for Home Rule. A militant faction sets off a series of bombs, and an explosion blows out a piece of Scotland Yard's Criminal Investigation Division. Cyrus Barker, who is a Private Enquiry Agent, volunteers to locate and infiltrate the group responsible for the bombing. Reluctantly, Mr. Robert Anderson of the Home Office agrees to Barker's \\"mad scheme to hoodwink the Irish.\\"<br /><br />Cyrus Barker disguises himself as the reclusive Johannes van Rhyn, a German explosives expert. Barker uses his wide range of contacts to find the most militant of the Irish anarchists, known as the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and he feigns sympathy with their cause. As van Rhyn, Barker offers to help the Brotherhood build more effective and deadlier bombs. In the process, both Cyrus and Thomas risk their lives to prevent this desperate group from committing further acts of violence.<br /><br />Will Thomas beautifully evokes the language, class distinctions, and political infighting of England in the late 1800's. It's all here, from Charles Parnell living the high life with his English mistress to William Butler Yeats writing poetry for Maire O'Casey, the sister of one of the anarchists. There is subtle humor, authentic atmosphere, colorful dialogue, a touch of romance, and an instructive history lesson about terrorism in Victorian England.<br /><br />Cyrus Barker and Thomas Llewelyn are marvelous characters. Barker has a private chef prepare his gourmet meals, but he is willing to \\"live rough\\" when he is on a case. He is a master of disguise, foreign accents, and hand-to-hand combat (including stick fighting) and he has useful underworld connections. Llewelyn screws up his courage and follows the lead of his fearless and adventurous boss. He knows that if the militants discover their true identity, he and Barker are as good as dead. Still, Thomas owes his life to his mentor, and he is willing to carry out Barker's orders, whatever the consequences.

Michael Lawson's debut political thriller,\\"The Inside Ring,\\" features Joe DeMarco, a lawyer and troubleshooter for the powerful Speaker of the House, John Fitzgerald Mahoney.  Mahoney orders Joe to find the truth behind an apparent attempt to assassinate the President of the United States.  An assailant wounded the President and killed both the President's best friend and a Secret Service agent.  Although the authorities have identified an alleged suspect in the shooting, questions still remain.  How did the attacker penetrate the tight security surrounding the President?  What was the motive for the shooting?  Most intriguing of all, who sent a note to the Secretary of Homeland Security, Andy Banks, warning him in advance that someone would try to kill the President?<br /><br />The \\"inside ring\\" refers to those elite Secret Service agents who are closest to the President when he is on the move.  They are expected to sacrifice themselves, if necessary, to protect the President from harm.  Joe decides to investigate the Secret Service agents in the inside ring, and his inquiries ruffle the feathers of some highly placed and politically powerful individuals.  Patrick Donnelly, the director of the Secret Service, is furious.  He wants the investigation closed, insisting that it is absurd to assign blame to any of his agents.<br /><br />\\"The Inside Ring\\" is an exciting and fast-paced novel of suspense.  Joe DeMarco is, in many ways, a breath of fresh air.  He is the son of a mobster, but hates violence; he is as inept with his fists as he is with firearms.  Nor is Joe a great success with the ladies.  He has an ex-wife and no steady girlfriend.  In thrillers of this type, the protagonist is often a superhero who cradles a semiautomatic in one hand and a gorgeous blonde in the other.  Joe is smart, tenacious, courageous, and honest, but he is not very effective with weapons or women.  He is a person that the average reader can root for.<br /><br />Another intriguing character is Emma, a former member of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a friend of Joe's.  Although she is attractive, Emma is no bimbo.  She is a fiftyish woman who has been there and done that.  She has access to classified information and has a whole cadre of ex-cops, ex-soldiers, and computer hackers on hand to do her bidding.  This fearless and formidable woman, who is extremely comfortable with firearms, provides Joe with the resources that he needs to go up against some fairly sadistic villains.  It's a nice twist to give a prominent role to a middle-aged female protagonist with both brains and toughness.<br /><br />Michael Lawson's story, although convoluted and not entirely realistic, is involving, suspenseful, and entertaining.  Lawson has a breezy style, and I enjoyed the smart and humorous dialogue, delicious political intrigue, and chilling action sequences. \\"The Inside Ring\\" is an auspicious first novel by a promising author.ing character is Emma, a former member of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a friend of Joe's.

After more than two decades abroad, Merlyn Docherty has returned to the bosom of his family, the Cantelos, to attend the funeral of his beloved Aunt Clarissa.  However, the Cantelos are less than thrilled to see Merlyn.  Some of them are even accusing him of being an impostor who wants to get his hands on Clarissa's estate.  Merlyn soon suspects that the Cantelo family is hiding something from him, and he intends to find out what it is--unless, of course, someone kills him first.<br /><br />Robert Barnard's \\"The Graveyard Position\\" is a talky and occasionally amusing psychological mystery about a dysfunctional and mean-spirited family.  Grandfather Cantelo, the patriarch, was a vicious and self-centered man who brought up his large brood to compete with one another.  As a result, the Cantelo family is comprised of bitter and suspicious misfits rather than loving and cooperative relatives.  When Merlyn gets to know the Cantelos, he finds them to be a repellant bunch.  However, he needs to stick around long enough to prove that he is indeed Merlyn and to claim his rightful inheritance.<br /><br />Most of this book consists of long-winded conversations between Merlyn and his family, the police, and people who knew the Cantelos over the years.  In addition, Merlyn reminisces about his troubled childhood, and he does his own research into the Cantelo family history.  Ultimately, he unearths an explosive secret that his family has been taking great pains to hide for many years.  All of this adds up to an intermittently engrossing, but rather tame, novel, in which the author tries to be funny and serious at the same time.  Barnard's story does provide valuable insight into the stresses that can tear families apart, and there are some genuinely funny moments here and there.  However, the \\"The Graveyard Position\\" lacks the suspense and the satirical bite that has made Barnard so effective in the past.	2005-05-02

Detective Superintendent Harriet Martens of Greater Birchester Police is lounging near a pool on a hot August afternoon, sipping a Campari soda, when she suddenly experiences strange and violent symptoms.  Harriet is fortunate; the quick action of her husband, John, and the skills of an expert doctor bring her through what could easily have been a fatal attack.  It seems that an unknown assailant slipped a poison called aconitine into Harriet's drink. In H. R. F. Keating's new mystery, \\"A Detective at Death's Door,\\" other poisoning victims follow, and they are not as lucky as Harriet.<br /><br />Harriet's recuperation is slow.  She is ordered to stay at home for three months, lest she suffer a relapse.  However, she cannot lie still while a killer is still at large.  She is determined to assist DS Pat Murphy, the Senior Investigating Officer on the case, even if it means dragging herself out of her sickbed.  And that is exactly what Harriet does, much to the consternation of her worried husband.<br /><br />\\"A Detective at Death's Door\\" is a breezy and very funny mystery featuring a detective who is irrepressible, curious, and impulsive.  Harriet Martens is a determined woman with a vivid imagination.  She doesn't suffer fools gladly, but she is willing to make a fool out of herself if it means finding the murderer who tried to kill her.  Keating's dialogue is droll, and this book features a whole array of delightfully eccentric British characters.  I enjoyed Miss Earwaker, a former teacher and plant expert nearing eighty who takes Harriet on an expedition to find the source of monkshood, the plant from which aconitine is derived.  Another memorable character is Harriet's next-door neighbor, Mrs. Pickstock, an extremely solicitous individual who tries to keep Harriet in bed and offers Harriet tasteless organic concoctions to speed her recovery.<br /><br />Keating keeps the proceedings moving along briskly, and although the story's resolution is not entirely logical, that is almost beside the point.

First of all, she is assigned to extract information from a feared serial killer named Raphael Moreno, who has been convicted of seven gruesome homicides.  Carolyn typically goes into a room with hardened criminals and uses her wiles and knowledge of psychology to get these miscreants to open up to her.  Even a tough and experienced professional would be terrified when confronting someone as ruthless as Moreno.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Carolyn's brother, Neil, is in trouble.  His girlfriend, Laurel, has been found dead in his swimming pool and he is a prime suspect.  Neil has also been having an affair with the beautiful Melody Asher, an unstable, fabulously wealthy, and pathologically jealous woman.  Melody is Neil's alibi, but her desire to retaliate against her faithless lover may be stronger than her affection for him.  As the story unfolds, Carolyn finds out that there is a bizarre connection between Raphael Moreno and her brother, Neil.<br /><br />\\"Sullivan's Justice\\" is filled with explicit sex scenes, violence, stilted dialogue, high-octane action sequences, and more twists and turns than a pretzel.  The characters are one-dimensional, the plot is outlandish, and the ending is way over the top.  Carolyn Sullivan is your typical good-looking, brainy, spunky, and reckless heroine who puts herself in dangerous situations time and time again.  There is little suspense, and the constant adrenaline rush quickly grows tiresome.  As I have said many times, thrillers with fleshed out characters and at least quasi-realistic plot lines are far more satisfying than action-packed novels that make little sense.  \\"Sullivan's Justice\\" is a clinker.	2005-05-02

It turns out that the nun was hiding a shocking secret, and Muse's investigation into her death may shed light on Olivia Hunter's past. \\"The Innocent\\" is a dark tale of blackmail, greed, corruption, and vengeance. Coben ends his story with a host of startling revelations and lengthy explanations that attempt to clarify the plot's twists and turns.<br /><br />Matt and Olivia Hunter are likeable characters and much of the dialogue in \\"The Innocent\\" is clever, lively, and funny. I especially liked a story line about Matt's talks with the mother of the man he killed. Their conversations are haunting and poignant. The problem with this novel is that as it progresses, it becomes ridiculously complicated, with an ending so preposterous that it had me scratching my head in disbelief. Coben is a talented writer, but he tends to create overly convoluted stories that are akin to Rube Goldberg contraptions with dozens of moving parts. When the creaky plot machinery gets in the way of character development and realism, the story loses steam. If Coben had streamlined his story and constructed it with more care, \\"The Innocent\\" might have been a more effective, exciting, and suspenseful thriller.	2005-04-28

The author, Robert L. Hilliard, was an American soldier stationed in Germany in 1945. This is Hilliard's account of what he saw and the steps that he and others took to improve the conditions in the displaced persons camps. After World War II ended, the survivors had no place to go. They could not return to Poland, Germany, or wherever they came from, to resume the lives that they had before the war. Very few of them were allowed to emigrate to America. Some wanted to enter Palestine, but that was not a realistic hope, since the British had set up a blockade to keep the Jews out.<br /><br />In Germany, the United States Military Government (USMG) organized DP camps for the survivors. Life in these camps differed from concentration camp life in one key way. The inmates were not sent to gas chambers. However, they were deprived of basic necessities, such as food, medical supplies, and clothing.  The Americans surrounded the camps with barbed wire, and some people who tried to leave the camps were shot. Ironically, many survivors of the concentration camps died from malnutrition and disease in the DP camps because of the neglect that they suffered at the hands of their American \\"saviors.\\" Ironically, known Nazis received plenty of food, decent housing, and jobs, while displaced persons lived in subhuman conditions.<br /><br />Hilliard focuses on a hospital, St. Ottilien, located in northern Bavaria, in which hundreds of survivors struggled to live from day to day with little food and inadequate medical treatment. Hilliard was conscience-stricken by the conditions in St. Ottilien. Soon, he and his buddies were smuggling in food for the malnourished residents of the hospital. Eventually, Hilliard and a fellow G. I., Edward Herman, sent a letter describing the conditions in the DP camps.  Somehow, the letter came to the attention of President Harry Truman, who was outraged.  He ordered Eisenhower to end the soldiers' abuse of the Jews in Europe. \\"Surviving the Americans\\" is an informative, provocative, and unsettling true story about a few men of conscience who were willing to break U.

World War II has ended, and both expatriates and natives of Venice dress up, attend parties, and live for the pleasures of the moment.  Grace Miller is an American widow who rents a lovely house in Venice.  She has become reacquainted with an old friend from her youth, Dr. Gianni Maglione.  She and Gianni wish to marry, but Gianni has a past, and it will come back to haunt them both.<br /><br />Grace's son, Adam, a war crimes investigator for the U. S. government, is in Venice to visit his mother.  He falls in love with a Jewish woman named Claudia, who has terrible memories of her traumatic wartime experiences.  Adam wants to gain Claudia's trust, but she has been badly scarred in the past, and she may never be able to forget what she has endured.  Meanwhile, Adam starts to investigate Gianni's activities during the war, and what he finds throws everyone's lives into turmoil.<br /><br />\\"Alibi\\" is suspenseful and gripping.  The descriptions of Venice are detailed and vivid, and they add immeasurably to the book's atmosphere.  Kanon deals skillfully with some complex moral questions.  Is it acceptable to cooperate with an evil government to save one's own life?  Should people be held culpable for crimes that occurred years ago?  Is it ever right to use violence to avenge past wrongs?  Kanon also explores the political and social corruption that is often hidden beneath the veneer of polite society.<br /><br />Kanon falters, however, towards the end of the book, when too many melodramatic events dilute the story's impact.  Still,  \\"Alibi\\" is a strong character study of flawed people trying to cope with unpleasant memories, guilt, and the struggle to survive at all costs.  It is also an effective exploration of crime, punishment, and the terrible price of war.	2005-04-26

Nick's fame spreads even more when a movie-of-the-week is made about the Reasoner case, with Armand Assante playing Nick. One day, a thirtyish woman named Liza Rummel approaches Nick, asking him to help her find her missing fifteen-year-old daughter, Amanda. He agrees to take the case, but while he is investigating the matter, he begins to suffer from severe and troubling neurological symptoms.<br /><br />Suddenly, Nick finds himself flat on his back in a hospital bed, and he is diagnosed with a life-threatening condition. He loses part of his memory, and his investigation of Amanda's disappearance is placed on the back burner. When Nick finally gets out of the hospital, he tries to piece his life back together bit by bit. Not only does Nick have trouble recalling the simplest things about his past, but he also must make vital medical decisions that will affect his future. After leaving the hospital, Nick tries continues working on the Amanda investigation, but he has almost no memory of what he has accomplished so far. He attempts to retrace his steps and piece together the bits of information that will help him solve the case.<br /><br />\\"Oblivion\\" is a clever and maddening book with some passages of delicious black humor. It is very confusing and requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. The author would have us believe that Nick Petrov suffers a major illness, and yet he has the desire and ability to somehow continue working in the throes of seizures, dizziness, weakness, and even partial paralysis. In addition, Nick forms an unlikely relationship with a nurse, Billie, who takes care of him in the hospital.<br /><br />I like Abrahams' prose style, which, although cryptic, is also smart, brash, and funny. Abrahams has fun with Nick's character transformation. He changes from a self-centered and shallow person who has all the answers to a man humbled by circumstance; he now lacks the answers to even the most basic questions.

Instead, she wonders why a pumpkin suddenly shows up in her yard, she discusses with Mma Makutsi the merits of ordinary tea vs. bush tea, and she solves a troubling personal problem with a minimum of effort.  The best part of the book is an amusing and poignant episode in which Mma Makutsi meets a shy but kind man in her dance class.  He is homely, has two left feet, and he stutters, but he is an eligible bachelor who seems to be genuinely fond of Mma Makutsi.<br /><br />Overall, nothing much happens in this novel.  It saddens me that this wonderful series is becoming repetitious and a bit stale.  Precious Ramotswe has provided millions of readers with hours of pleasure, but at this point, she may be overstaying her welcome.pleasure, but at this point, she may be overstaying her welcome. <br />	2005-04-26

Jacquelyn Mitchard's new novel, \\"The Breakdown Lane,\\" is the story of a family's disintegration.  Julieanne and Leo Steiner have been married for twenty years and, although they have their problems, they seem to be a happy couple.  Soon, however, Leo shows signs of discontent; he has a classic male midlife crisis.  Leo suddenly decides to take an extended trip away from his family, and Julieanne is left with three children, very little money, and an unexpected diagnosis of multiple sclerosis that leaves her depressed, debilitated, and frightened.<br /><br />Mitchard does female angst well, but there are portions of this novel that are too formulaic, too reminiscent of the many other novels of this type that are published every year.  The man in his forties who turns his back on his loving family, the convenient best girlfriend who steps in to help the beleaguered wife, the quarrels between the custodial parent and her rebellious children--we have seen these scenes so many times before.  In addition, the dialogue in the first half of the novel is filled with quips and forced humor that quickly become irritating.<br /><br />However, Mitchard redeems herself in the second half of the book.  She gets down to business and starts taking Julieanne's plight seriously.  We learn about the ways that multiple sclerosis can affect an individual like Julieanne who was a ballet dancer and is still in great shape.  Mitchard alternates chapters that are told through Julianne's eyes and those of her adolescent son, Gabe.  Gabe, who is a gifted young man with a learning disability, becomes the man of the house when his dad leaves, and his sister, Caroline, takes her rage out on her mother.  Julieanne is often so sick that she cannot get out of bed without help.  Leo's parents, Hannah and Gabe senior, are wonderful people who step in to keep Julieanne's head above water, emotionally, physically and financially.  Mitchard beautifully depicts the warmth and unselfishness of these loving grandparents.<br /><br />In addition, the author effectively demonstrates how messy and unpredictable life can be.  Julieanne was born into an aristocratic family; her father was a famous writer and they lived upper class lives.  However, this life of privilege does not protect Julieanne forever, and she eventually finds herself pinching pennies to make ends meet.  Ironically, she earns a bit of money as an advice columnist for a local newspaper.  She tells people how to fix their lives, while her own is falling apart.<br /><br />By the time I finished \\"The Breakdown Lane,\\" I was invested in the characters and I was anxious to know how each one would fare in life.  Does Leo get his comeuppance?  Does Julieanne climb out of her slough of despond?  How do the children survive the changes in their lives?  Although Mitchard's plot resolutions are not all very realistic, they are satisfying and poignant.  A little melodrama and a good cry may not be great literature, but it has its own satisfactions.  \\"The Breakdown Lane\\" is cathartic, and, in its own way, it is a testament to the resilience of a mother and children brought low by circumstances beyond their control.loving grandparents. <br /> <br />In addition, the author effectively demonstrates how messy and unpredictable life can be.

Dan Brown has made his mark in the world of fiction by combining complex mental puzzles with action-filled adventure and romance.  His thriller, \\"Digital Fortress\\" has all of these elements, and it is an exhilarating novel that raises timely and thought-provoking questions.<br /><br />A covert agency, known as NSA (jokingly, \\"No Such Agency\\"), has a multi-billion dollar secret device known as TRANSLTR that can decrypt any code.  It is used to eavesdrop on encrypted email communications worldwide; the data that it gathers prevents terrorists from carrying out planned attacks.  However, if civilians were to find out that Uncle Sam is eavesdropping on them, they might not be too pleased.  Ensei Tankado, a cryptographer who was dismissed by the NSA, hates everything that TRANSTR stands for.  He believes that the government has gone too far in invading people's privacy.<br /><br />Tankado claims to have created an unbreakable algorithm, known as \\"digital fortress,\\" that even TRANSLTR cannot decipher.  He threatens to release his algorithm unless the NSA publicly admits that it illegally gathers private information.  If the general public were to learn Tankado's code, the government would lose its ability to read encrypted emails. Tankado's scheme goes awry, and what might have been merely a nuisance threatens to turn into a disaster.<br /><br />Brown makes the most of his subject.  His descriptions of how cryptographers work and think are terrific, and I was fascinated by the mind-bending ciphers at the end of the novel. The protagonists, Susan Fletcher and David Becker, are nicely drawn, although a tad too superhuman.  Susan is a brilliant cryptographer who works for the NSA, and David is an expert in linguistics.  They both play a major role in trying to save the United States from an intelligence meltdown.<br /><br />\\"Digital Fortress\\" does have some weak points, including Brown's inability to write realistic romantic dialogue.  However, when Brown sticks to sadistic assassins, wild chase scenes, and unlikely heroics, the story moves along at a breakneck pace.  In addition, the author has some significant things to say about the conflict between an individual's right to privacy and the government's mission to do whatever it takes to safeguard its citizenry.and unlikely heroics, the story moves along at a breakneck pace.

Gideon is a forensic anthropologist who has been nicknamed the \\"Skeleton Detective\\" because of his ability to solve murders by finding clues in skeletal remains.  His good friend, FBI agent John Lau, invites Gideon to an old college chum's Hawaiian ranch for a relaxing vacation.  Gideon happily agrees.  Alas, wherever he goes, old bones connected to an unsolved homicide are invariably found.<br /><br />Sure enough, when Gideon and John arrive at Axel Torkelsson's ranch, the Torkelsson clan is in a dither.  Axel's Uncle Magnus disappeared ten years ago in a small plane.  Now, the fuselage of Magnus's plane has been found in a remote lagoon, and nothing remains but a few artifacts and old bones.  Gideon is asked to take a look at the bones, and sure enough, what he finds may mean big trouble for the entire Torkelsson family.<br /><br />\\"Where There's a Will\\" is a diverting mystery.  Elkins writes with a humorous touch and his dialogue and plot are fast-paced.  I love his detailed description of Hawaii, with its fields of hardened lava, lush pasturelands, and glorious sunsets.  The Torkelssons are an unusual family.  They include the hard-drinking, eighty-two year old Dagmar, who wants to enjoy her old age in peace, Hedwig, a vegetarian who runs a center for \\"spiritual wellness,\\" and Inge, a mannish woman who operates a successful dude ranch.  Gideon has the feeling that they are all hiding something, but he is not sure what it is.<br /><br />Elkins develops his plot skillfully and he brings the proceedings to a satisfying conclusion.  If you like mysteries that are brisk, suspenseful, and filled with light-hearted banter, you will enjoy \\"Where There's a Will.\\"  At the very least, it will make you want to catch the next plane to Hawaii.	2005-04-10

Malcolm Gladwell is now a household name, thanks to \\"The Tipping Point,\\" his smash bestseller about how ideas spread.  His new book, \\"Blink,\\" already a bestseller, is about \\"the power of thinking without thinking.\\"  Are you the type of person who analyzes situations every which way before coming to a decision?  Or do you tend to make up your mind based on your intuition and instincts?  Gladwell addresses both of these tendencies and explains why careful analysis sometimes helps us succeed but, in other circumstances, may cause us to fall flat on our faces.<br /><br />As he did in \\"The Tipping Point,\\" Gladwell brings a host of real life examples to illustrate his ideas.  He discusses a variety of subjects, such as speed dating, the art of military strategy, cola tasting, and police behavior.  The author's strength lies in his ability to tell engrossing anecdotes and relate them to the themes that he wants to impart to the reader.  If you observe a married couple bickering, can you make an accurate prediction about whether or not they will eventually divorce?  Can a doctor's bedside manner affect the number of malpractice suits brought against him?  Gladwell addresses these and other questions using clear and compelling prose, humor, and thought-provoking psychological insight.<br /><br />How can this book help the average person navigate his life more effectively?  \\"Blink\\" may help us prevent our subconscious biases from adversely affecting our judgment.  In addition, it may educate us about the advantages and the pitfalls of making decisions based on first impressions.  This is an entertaining study of problem solving, and that's an area in which everyone can learn something valuable.	2005-04-08

Nick Conover is a man whose life is about to take a nosedive in \\"Company Man,\\" Joseph Finder's latest and, perhaps, best novel.  Nick has already endured the loss of his beloved wife, Laura, in a car accident.  He is uneasy being a single parent to his sixteen-year-old son and his ten-year-old daughter.  As the CEO of Stratton Industries, a manufacturer of high-end office furniture, he has overseen the layoffs of thousands of workers.  Many people who live in his small Michigan town hate Conover for failing to save these people's jobs.<br /><br />Conover lives with his kids in a gated mansion, but the security surrounding his home fails to prevent a series of break-ins, one of which results in the evisceration of their dog, Barney.  Nick is terrified that he will be unable to protect himself and his children from the vicious and potentially lethal enemy who is threatening them. Soon tragedy strikes, and Nick is up to his ears in personal and professional problems.  One of the few bright spots in Nick's life is a new relationship that he has formed with a lovely woman named Cassie.  She supports him emotionally and has a magical way of communicating with Nick's children.<br /><br />Finder develops his large cast of characters deftly and they are all well integrated into the complex story.  The protagonist, Nick Conover, is a concerned and caring parent, but he has never resolved his guilt feelings about his late wife's death.  He is also unable to communicate with his son, Lucas, who is showing signs of becoming an emotional train wreck.<br /><br />I particularly liked the character of Audrey Rimes, an African-American detective with the Major Case Team.  She is a sharp and dogged investigator whose marriage has deteriorated since her husband lost his job at Stratton Industries.  She has had to endure the pranks and slurs of racist and chauvinistic colleagues who insult her on the job.  However, Audrey is a church-going woman whose faith has kept her strong over the years, and she will not give up her marriage or her professional ambitions without a fight.  When Audrey suspects that Nick may be involved in the murder of an emotionally disturbed man who was laid off by Nick's company, she pursues him relentlessly.<br /><br />\\"Company Man\\" features realistic dialogue, an involving and fast-paced story with nitty-gritty details about police procedure, and an exciting, surprising, and nail-biting finale.  In addition, Finder skillfully handles such themes as the tug-of-war between job and family responsibilities, and the importance of following the dictates of one's conscience.  This book is more than just a paint-by-numbers thriller.  It is an engrossing and carefully crafted novel.ot give up her marriage or her professional ambitions without a fight.

As a boy he was beaten, neglected, and moved around from one horrible foster home to another.  He committed a variety of crimes and spent time in juvenile detention. At the age of fifteen, he was convicted of murder and landed in a federal penitentiary.  \\"Bleedout,\\" by Joan Brady, is the story of David's painful road to redemption.<br /><br />Hugh Freyl is a blind attorney who takes David under his wing.  He visits the young man in prison, educates him, and devises legal strategies that will eventually free him.  When Hugh is beaten to death, David attempts to track down the killer of his friend and mentor. His odyssey leads him down a circuitous path of corruption, insanity, betrayal, and death.<br /><br />Brady has a gimmicky narrative style.  Part of the book is told in the first person by the dead attorney, Hugh Freyl, who talks poignantly about his blindness, his profession, the woman he loves, and most of all, his obsession with helping David.  The rest of the book takes place in the present, and follows David's investigation of Hugh Freyl's death and his own journey of self-discovery.<br /><br />\\"Bleedout\\" works better as a psychological novel than it does as a crime thriller.  Brady vividly describes the horrors of prison life and the manner in which David acquires the skills that help him survive.  Thanks to Hugh, David has acquired an education, but he has trouble learning to trust anyone, even himself.  He forms an uneasy alliance with Hugh's mother, Becky Freyl, a formidable woman who is imperious, wealthy, and powerful, and with Stephanie, Hugh's former assistant.<br /><br />\\"Bleedout\\" starts out intriguingly, but it meanders more and more as the narrative progresses.  David gets involved in forensic accounting, which is a stretch, and there are distracting subplots involving a Supreme Court justice, a crooked attorney, and an ambitious and opportunistic politician. The denouement of the book is shocking and not entirely believable.  \\"Bleedout\\" has some moments of undeniable power, and I was genuinely interested in David and Hugh's unusual friendship, but the book is not cohesive enough to make the grade as a first-rate thriller.and not entirely believable.  \\"Bleedout\\" has some moments of undeniable power, and I was genuinely interested in David and Hugh's unusual friendship, but the book is not cohesive enough to make the grade as a first-rate thriller. <br />	2005-04-01

Elizabeth George's latest novel, \\"With No One as Witness,\\" features two of my favorite characters in British police procedurals, Detective Inspector Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Lynley and Barbara Havers.  Lynley and Havers were partners in earlier books, but Havers has been demoted to Detective Constable and Tommy, who is Acting Superintendent at New Scotland Yard, is now her boss.  Lynley and Havers are, on the surface, polar opposites.  Tommy is charming, handsome, wealthy, and aristocratic.  Although she is a kind and caring person, Barbara comes across as crude, stubborn, and tactless.  She chain smokes, dresses in a slovenly manner, and drives an old rattletrap that threatens to break down constantly.  However, Barbara and Tommy are alike in one important area.  They are both dedicated professionals who care passionately about bringing criminals to justice.<br /><br />This time around, Barbara and Tommy have their work cut out for them.  A cunning psychopath has been murdering and mutilating adolescent boys, and there are no witnesses and little evidence to help the police with their inquiries.  Lynley is in charge of the investigation, and he has a hard time reining in Barbara Havers.  She has an unerring instinct for the chase, and she would much rather go off on her own than follow orders.  Worse than Barbara's independent streak is the behavior of Tommy's boss, Assistant Commissioner Hillier. The AC is so sensitive to outside pressure that he sacrifices the integrity of the investigation to gain political points and favorable media coverage.  Tommy would gladly throttle Hillier if he could.<br /><br />Elizabeth George's strength is in her characters, particularly Lynley and Havers.  George skillfully describes the agonizing lot of homicide detectives, who are under constant stress.  They are exposed to the most horrifying aspects of humanity, and the grisly crime scenes that they observe are nightmare-inducing.  To make matters worse, the public and the media expect the police to solve high-profile cases quickly.  However, as George ably demonstrates, not all cases lend themselves to easy solutions.  A detective's job is often tedious, time-consuming, and extremely frustrating.  Every lead, no matter how small, must be investigated, and most turn out to be of little or no value.  In this lengthy book, Havers and her colleagues put in countless hours examining every clue and interviewing dozens of people, many more than once.<br /><br />George does a fine job of humanizing her detectives and giving us insight into their private lives.  Tommy's blissful marriage to Helen is marred by a minor family disagreement.  Barbara's involvement with her neighbors, the exuberant and irrepressible eight-year-old Hadiyyah Azhar and her father, Taymullah, bring her both satisfaction and grief.  Winston Nkata, who has been promoted to Detective Sergeant because of racial reasons, is angry to be paraded before the public as a token black detective.  George effectively shows how a job in law enforcement sometimes damages or destroys personal relationships.<br /><br />The author is less successful in her depiction of a serial killer who is straight out of central casting.  He is a ritualistic psychopath who was abused as a child and hears voices in his head berating him as worthless.  This plot has been used too many times before.  Another flaw is the over-the-top ending that is marred by several far-fetched developments.

Does Scotland bring to mind kilts, bagpipes, and bonnie lassies?  Well, think again.  According to Rankin, Glasgow is one of the murder capitals of the world.  \\"Fleshmarket Alley\\" is filled with gangsters, racists, sexual predators, and more than a few common criminals.<br /><br />John Rebus is close to being put out to pasture.  Since his bosses have no use for him, he finds himself in Knoxland, a run-down, fetid, and crime-ridden housing development in Edinburgh. Knoxland has become a dumping ground for desperate refugees seeking asylum in Scotland; it is now a crime scene where an unidentified man was brutally stabbed to death.  Meanwhile, a desperate couple has enlisted Siobhan to find their eighteen-year-old daughter, Ishbel, who packed a bag a week earlier and disappeared without a word.<br /><br />Rebus is an inspector of the old school. He has a wide range of contacts, both legitimate and shady, whom he calls upon for inside information. It is amazing that Rebus can take a breath or stand up, since he seems to smoke and drink constantly. However, he is as sharp as ever, and what he lacks in youth, he makes up for in instinct, experience, and dogged persistence.<br /><br />\\"Fleshmarket Alley\\" is a frank and disturbing look at the seamier side of Scotland.  Rankin's characters range from racists who want all immigrants to go back \\"where they came from\\" to greedy opportunists who enrich themselves at the refugees' expense.  As Rebus and Clarke work on their cases, they interview potential eyewitnesses as well as wealthy flesh peddlers and street thugs.  However, the two detectives both find that their investigations are too complex to yield quick and simple solutions.<br /><br />Rankin's dialogue in this novel is hard-edged and laced with dark humor; his plotting is intricate and involving.  He skillfully and compassionately explores the problems of immigrants who seek refuge in a country where they are unwanted.  As always, Rankin writes credibly about the politics, tedium, and often frustrating futility of police work.

Common sense dictates that to succeed in marketing a product widely, a company should buy advertising in high profile media outlets during prime time.  In addition, to combat teen smoking, parents should shun cigarettes themselves (to set a good example for their kids), and public health officials should launch powerful anti-smoking campaigns in schools and on television.  Malcolm Gladwell, in his smash bestseller \\"The Tipping Point:  How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,\\" challenges these and other conventional ideas.<br /><br />The author makes the case that epidemics of viruses, ideas, and behavior do not always originate or spread in obvious ways.  Only by studying the manner in which epidemics really work can we hope to either make them more widespread or stop them in their tracks.  The author introduces a whole new vocabulary in this bible of counter-intuitive thinking.  For instance, the aforementioned \\"tipping point\\"  is the \\"dramatic moment in an epidemic when everything can change all at once.\\"  To explain the mechanics of epidemics, Gladwell also introduces such phrases as \\"The Law of the Few,\\" \\"The Stickiness Factor,\\" and \\"The Power of Context.\\"  In chapters that deal with such topics as suicide, children's television, fashion, and AIDS,  Gladwell cites studies that show, again and again, that common sense is often wrong.  We have to think out of the box to understand how contagion works in the real world.<br /><br />Why read this book at all?  Does the average person care about how epidemics start, spread, or stop?  One reason to pick up \\"The Tipping Point\\" is that it is enormously entertaining.  Gladwell imparts his lively ideas clearly and with the skill of a seasoned storyteller.  His conclusions are intriguing and thought-provoking; this book has the potential to change how we view the people and events in our own lives.  I have no idea whether or not every fact and concept in \\"The Tipping Point\\" is one hundred percent accurate, but it is a great read.  I can certainly understand why Gladwell's ideas have spread like wildfire.I can certainly understand why Gladwell's ideas have spread like wildfire.	2005-03-13

Stephen White's \\"Missing Persons\\" is an engrossing psychological mystery, replete with black humor, strange plot twists, and more than a few colorful characters.  Clinical psychologist and amateur sleuth Alan Gregory, along with his friend and colleague, Diane Estevez, is scheduled to leave Boulder, Colorado for a weekend professional workshop in Las Vegas.  A shocking discovery prompts the pair to cancel their trip, and Alan is launched on a wild and dangerous roller coaster ride.<br /><br />What makes Stephen White stand out among other authors of psychological mysteries is his lively descriptive writing and the way that he skillfully integrates many intriguing details of the therapeutic process into his plot.  Alan's patients include a chronically depressed and schizoid individual named Bob Brandt, who hints that he may know something about the disappearance of a fourteen-year-old girl named Mallory Miller.  Bob's symptoms include a reluctance to make eye contact with others and an inability to form social relationships.  Yet, in therapy, Bob tantalizes Dr. Gregory with clues indicating that he may have been Mallory's friend.  Does Bob know what happened to Mallory or is he fantasizing?  Alan can't go to the police with his suspicions because he is handcuffed by doctor-patient confidentiality rules; in most cases, it is unethical to divulge information learned during therapy.<br /><br />Sam Purdy, Alan's friend and a Boulder detective, would like to throttle his buddy for being so secretive about his patients.  Purdy becomes even more upset when, soon after, several other individuals connected with Mallory Miller also vanish without a trace.  Sam fears that Alan will keep his own counsel and decide to conduct his own private investigation.<br /><br />\\"Missing Persons\\" is a fast-paced, very funny, and cleverly plotted jigsaw puzzle.  This is one of those rare novels in which realism goes by the board without hurting the narrative.  The many eccentric individuals and unlikely events in this book somehow all converge satisfactorily in the end.  Alan Gregory is an engaging narrator.  Not only is he a devoted husband and father, but he is also a dedicated mental health professional with a conscience.  In this entertaining and off-beat novel, White shows that everyone has strengths, weakness, and frailties, including policemen, psychologists, and criminals.iduals and unlikely events in this book somehow all converge satisfactorily in the end.

A young man named Aidan Hennessy has disappeared and his twin sister, seventeen-year-old Marlinchen, begs Sarah to track him down.  When Sarah agrees to help, she finds out that underneath the wholesome façade of the Hennessy family is a complex web of lies and deceit.  In addition, Sarah is under suspicion for the murder of Royce Stewart (this plot is also covered in Compton's first book) and an aggressive new investigator, Gray Diaz, is anxious to nail Sarah for the crime.  Most intriguing of all, Sarah gets emotionally involved with a wheelchair-bound doctor named Cicero who helps indigent patients in a housing project.<br /><br />I love the multi-layered character of Sarah Pribek.  She thinks nothing of risking her life by jumping into an filthy drainage canal to save a drowning boy, but she is terrified of going to a doctor's office to treat a simple ear infection.  She cares for her husband, Shiloh, but she is reluctant to talk to him about her feelings.  Sarah is a dogged and sharp investigator who is tough on criminals, but she is not above taking the law into her own hands to insure that justice is done.<br /><br />Jodi Compton pulls no punches.  She shows people behaving both selfishly and courageously, and she explores the beauty and ugliness of life with intelligence, insight, and understanding. Compton knows that truth is rarely black and white, and she fearlessly explores the shades of gray.<br /><br />My one quibble is that Compton unwisely concludes her book with four major plot twists when one or two would have been more than enough.  This flashy, over-the-top ending is exciting and unexpected, but it is also unrealistic and out-of-sync with the nuanced character development that makes the rest of the book so engrossing. Still,  I enjoyed \\"Sympathy Between Humans,\\" and I consider Jodi Compton to be one of the best new suspense writers to come along in recent years.shows people behaving both selfishly and courageously, and she explores the beauty and ugliness of life with intelligence, insight, and understanding.

Jodi Picoult's \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is about the terrible toll that a long-term, life-threatening illness takes on a family.  Brian and Sara Fitzgerald are the devoted parents of two children, Kate and Jesse.  When Kate is diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia, her parents decide to have another child who will be genetically compatible with Kate.  This child, Anna, donates bone marrow to her sister and helps prolong her life.  However, as time goes on, Kate relapses again and again, and Anna is asked to undergo further painful procedures to help her sister.  Anna feels like a victim herself.  She wonders if her whole life will be defined by Kate's illness.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult effectively explores how Kate's medical condition affects the dynamics of her family.  The Fitzgeralds and their children experience a roller coaster of emotions--hope when Kate goes into remission and disappointment when she has a setback.  Sara and Brian are exhausted from constantly being on the alert as Kate's condition changes, often without warning.  Kate's illness affects her siblings psychologically, as well. Anna and Jesse feel that they are extensions of Kate.  The sick sister is the center of attention, since she is the one who may die at any moment.  Jesse becomes a surly, rebellious, and destructive teenager.  For a long time, Anna is compliant.  However, when Kate's kidneys begin to fail, Anna refuses to donate one of her own kidneys to save her sister's life.  She even retains a lawyer who initiates a court case on her behalf.<br /><br />\\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is a well-meaning book with a heart-rending and dramatic theme.  Picoult tells her story from different points of view in alternating chapters.  This approach enables the reader to empathize with and understand how each individual feels.  However, too many contrived plot developments ultimately weaken the novel's impact.  In addition, the writing is often heavy-handed and maudlin. A romance between Anna's lawyer, Campbell Alexander, and Julia, a woman whom he loved years ago, is forced; it doesn't fit in with the rest of the novel.  Most disturbing of all, instead of honestly handling Anna's decision about whether or not to donate her kidney, Picoult takes herself off the hook in a manner that had me shaking my head in disbelief.  This is too bad, since \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" had the potential to be a compelling and thought-provoking story about how far we should go to help the people we love.nd Julia, a woman whom he loved years ago, is forced; it doesn't fit in with the rest of the novel.

New Yorker Rochelle Weiss, the beautiful heroine of Gloria Goldreich's \\"Walking Home,\\" has always been a golden girl. Her mother and father survived the Holocaust, and they have taken great pains to protect their precious child from any unpleasantness.  In return, Rochelle tried to make her parents' lives as carefree as possible.  She was a top student in school as well as a star athlete.  Now that she is in her thirties, she has a great job at a top public relations firm and her Jewish boyfriend, Phil Gold, is equally good looking and successful.<br /><br />Sadly, Rochelle's parents both become seriously ill, and her life changes abruptly.  For the first time, Rochelle takes a hard look at herself.  What are her values?  Is she headed in the right direction?  Not only does Rochelle reevaluate her career choice, but she also examines her relationship with Phil.  Are she and her boyfriend headed for a permanent commitment or are they just two selfish yuppies who are incapable of settling down?<br /><br />Gloria Goldreich examines the culture of the successful modern urban professional with a keen eye.  People like Rochelle are used to having what they want when they want it.  They become completely disoriented when life throws them a curveball.  The  illness of her parents shakes Rochelle up to such an extent that she becomes confused and despondent.  After she leaves her job to be with her parents, Rochelle takes up dog-walking to earn some money while she considers her options.<br /><br />\\"Walking Home\\" is competently written, but it meanders a bit, especially in the second half.  Goldreich introduces an abundance of colorful and diverse characters, including fellow dog-walkers, the dogs' owners, various neighbors, an attractive artist, and a demanding poetry teacher who runs a workshop that Rochelle eagerly attends.  Rochelle has some hard decisions to make.  Should she devote her life to writing poetry?  Should she hook up with the artist? Although the book eventually loses its focus and has too many conventional soap-opera elements, Rochelle Weiss is an engaging character and \\"Walking Home\\" is a pleasant and romantic diversion.and has too many conventional soap-opera elements, Rochelle Weiss is an engaging character and \\"Walking Home\\" is a pleasant and romantic diversion.	2005-02-27

Catherine Ferry, the protagonist of \\"Blood Memory,\\" is in deep trouble.  She is an alcoholic with a long history of promiscuity and manic depression. Cat is a forensic odontologist who is having an affair with Sean Regan, a married homicide detective with the New Orleans Police Department.  Her relationship with Sean is an open secret that may soon derail both their careers and Sean's marriage.  Cat has helped Sean solve a number of murder cases in the past.  Now, they are investigating a series of brutal homicides of older men who were shot and covered with bite marks.  For reasons that elude her, Cat has had panic attacks at several of the crime scenes, and she is rapidly losing her professional credibility.<br /><br />Much of \\"Blood Memory\\" is a recounting of Cat's hazy recollections of her early childhood.  She fondly remembers her beloved father, Luke, a Vietnam veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.  Cat's grandfather, Dr. William Kirkland, is a powerful, tough, and influential businessman who has no tolerance for weakness.  Her mother and aunt are unhappy women with serious personal problems of their own.  Only by delving into her past will Cat uncover the dark secrets that have caused her so much pain for so many years.  Both in flashback and in the present, the author provides evocative and vivid descriptions of Natchez, Mississippi, Cat's and Iles' home town.<br /><br />\\"Blood Memory\\" starts out well.  Cat is a sympathetic heroine.  She is smart, tenacious, and beautiful, but her problems threaten to overwhelm her.  Will she be able to stay away from alcohol?  Will her mania and depression destroy her ability to function?  Will her married lover give up his wife and children to be with her?<br /><br />As \\"Blood Memory\\" progresses, however, the book gradually sinks under its own weight.  At almost five hundred pages, the narrative becomes increasingly repetitious and melodramatic.  One horror story after another emerges until, by the end of the book, I felt burdened and exhausted.<br /><br />Except for Cat, the characters are mostly one-dimensional.  Pearlie is the steadfast house servant who has tried to keep Cat's family from disintegrating over the years.  Michael Wells is a pediatrician who has always carried a torch for Cat, and he conveniently shows up to help her in her time of crisis.  Cat's grandfather, William Kirkland, is a stock villain with absolutely no redeeming features.  The only character other than Cat whom I found intriguing was Dr. Nathan Malik.  He is a psychiatrist who specializes in manic depression and repressed childhood memories of abuse.  Malik has a creepy aura about him and his supercilious manner reminded me a bit of Hannibal Lechter.<br /><br />By the time I finally turned the last page of this novel, I felt very weary and sad.  \\"Blood Memory\\" is about tormented individuals who suffer for the rest of their lives when vicious people rob them of their innocence.  Iles also explores the meaning of childhood memories, the psychology of vengeance, and the imperfections of our criminal justice system.

Daniel Silva has followed up his terrific trilogy with another outstanding novel.  \\"Prince of Fire\\" brings back Gabriel Allon, a gifted art restorer and master spy who has settled down in Venice with the lovely Chiara, whom he hopes to marry.  After a tempestuous life filled with tragedy and violence, Allon is trying to find the peace of mind that has thus far eluded him.  A huge bomb destroys the Israeli embassy in Rome and sinks any hope that Allon can live a placid life free of bloodshed.<br /><br />Ari Shamron, who is now seventy-five, was once the head of Israel's secret service and Gabriel's mentor. He is now a special advisor to Israel's prime minister.  Shamron visits Gabriel in Italy and informs him that Palestinian terrorists have uncovered Gabriel's true identity and may be targeting him for assassination.  He urges Gabriel to come out of retirement and lead a team that will hunt down a Palestinian mastermind named Khaled al-Khalifa.  This man is believed to be responsible not only for the attack in Rome, but also for two earlier blasts in Buenos Aires and Istanbul that killed over one hundred Jews.<br /><br />\\"Prince of Fire\\" is intricate, fast-paced, and absorbing.  Without sermonizing or pontificating, Silva explores the politics of hatred in the Middle East.  He skillfully traces the trail of terror that has left this region in a constant state of fear and mourning for so many years.  As we have come to expect from Silva, he writes exciting, suspenseful, and unpredictable action sequences that contain fascinating details about how spies operate.<br /><br />All of Silva's characters are well drawn, but Gabriel Allon is in a class by himself.  He has suffered great personal losses from which he can never completely recover.  Although he has repeatedly hunted down and slaughtered the enemies of his people, Gabriel remains a compassionate man who values human life.  In this book, he is confronted with a terrifying moral dilemma, and one particular scene in which he must make a split-second, life or death decision is simply electrifying.  \\"Prince of Fire\\" proves, once again, that Daniel Silva has mastered the art of writing espionage thrillers with intelligence, depth, and heart.ar scene in which he must make a split-second, life or death decision is simply electrifying.  \\"Prince of Fire\\" proves, once again, that Daniel Silva has mastered the art of writing espionage thrillers with intelligence, depth, and heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-22

Reading groups have become all the rage and Elizabeth Noble's new novel features five British women who meet once a month to talk about a book and to catch up with one another's lives.  The members of the group are Harriet, a stay-at-home mom, Nicole, a gorgeous woman whose husband is a compulsive adulterer, Polly, an independent single parent, Susan, a contented individual who feels lost when her adored mother's health starts to fail, and Clare, a midwife whose infertility threatens her marriage.  These women lean on one another, give advice (both wanted and unwanted), and provide moral support as they struggle with life-changing events.<br /><br />Some of the themes that Noble tackles in \\"The Reading Group\\" have soap opera elements.  However, to Noble's credit, she creates recognizable and sympathetic female characters who are three-dimensional people, and I was anxious to find out how they would resolve their problems.  Will Nicole, whose husband repeatedly cheats on her, have the courage to throw him out?  How will the infertile couple deal with their inability to have children?  Can Harriet, the discontented wife, learn to appreciate her devoted but unexciting husband?  These questions may sound trite, but throughout most of the book, they make for a compelling and fast-moving narrative.<br /><br />The dialogue is funny and true, and Noble's empathy for and understanding of women lends authenticity to her novel. The male characters, unfortunately, are not as fleshed out as their female counterparts. Most of the men can be described in one sentence. In addition, this 400 plus page book drags a bit towards the end as Noble gamely attempts to tie up the many loose ends that she has created.<br /><br />However, for the most part, \\"The Reading Group\\" succeeds. It is less about book discussions than it is about life. Although each month the women start to talk about whatever book was assigned, they always end up airing the pressing issues that are on their minds. Noble's characters use literature as an impetus to explore the stresses and rewards of parenthood, the difficulty of sustaining long-term relationships, and the painful necessity of sometimes having to make tough and often irrevocable choices. There is enough genuine emotion, compassion, and good storytelling here to make \\"The Reading Group\\" a worthwhile pick for an individual or perhaps, for a book club.ds.

Michael Robotham's debut thriller, \\"Suspect,\\" is about a clinical psychologist named Joe O'Loughlin.  Joe has a beautiful wife and an adorable eight-year-old daughter.  He also has a crippling progressive disease that is scaring him out of his wits. When Detective Inspector Vincent Ruiz invites Joe to give his professional opinion concerning the murder of a young woman found in West London, things begin to get really dicey.  Joe realizes that he knows this woman.  Her name is Catherine McBride and she was once his patient.<br /><br />Ruiz soon finds evidence linking Joe to Catherine and Joe becomes the prime suspect in the case.  His troubles, alas, are just beginning.  Eventually, Joe is in danger of losing his family, his practice, his freedom, and maybe even his life.  His only hope is to track down the real killer before it's too late. The book is told through Joe's eyes and he is a sympathetic and appealing character.  Besides being a loving husband and father, Joe is a caring mental health professional who goes the extra mile for his patients.  He is a person the reader can root for.<br /><br />The strongest elements in \\"Suspect\\" are the psychological ones.  We get to know the strengths, weakness, and quirks not only of Joe, but also of his wife, his friends, and his patients.  The book has some big surprises that make for a slam-bang, if overly melodramatic ending.<br /><br />\\"Suspect\\" also has some weaknesses.  The plot feels derivative;  the psychologist/psychiatrist whose life is being ruined by someone from his past has been done many times before.  There are a number of coincidences and far-fetched elements to the story that strain credulity.  What it lacks in originality, however, \\"Suspect\\" makes up for with its quick pace and excitement.  It's an entertaining page-turner that will grab your attention as you, along with Joe, piece together the clues and finally learn the truth.	2005-02-06

Nancy's mom was diagnosed with HIV in 1988 after receiving a tainted blood transfusion.  In those days, many hemophiliacs and others who received transfusions contracted AIDS from infected blood.  For the most part, the victims had no idea that they were in any danger.  CBS News reported that the \\"Red Cross neglected to inform hundreds of individuals they might be infected with the AIDS virus.\\"  It seems that tracking down people who received blood from HIV-infected donors is time-consuming and expensive.  What these victims didn't know did indeed hurt them.<br /><br />Draper wrote this book for several reasons.  She wanted to protest the prejudice that AIDS victims are often subject to in our society.  Nancy's mother often commented that she felt \\"dirty\\" because she was HIV positive.  Draper would like to raise everyone's awareness of the loneliness that AIDS victims feel, so that the stigma of having AIDS can be reduced if not eliminated.  In addition, Draper speaks out against insensitive medical professionals who are cold and uncaring instead of warm and compassionate.  Finally, since Nancy's mother swore her to silence, Draper wrote this book in order to exorcise her own personal demons after keeping the truth about her mother's illness a secret for so long.<br /><br />\\"A Burden of Silence\\" is not elegantly written.  Draper's prose style is stilted and a bit artificial.  However, she makes up for this deficit with her honest and unembellished recounting of her experiences.  She bares her soul, telling the reader in detail about her family's many other health problems (the author has rheumatoid arthritis and her son has cerebral palsy) and about how difficult it was for her to watch her mother deteriorate before her eyes.<br /><br />I was particularly fascinated by the section of the book describing the AIDS Memorial Quilt Project, which was started in the 1980's to raise AIDS awareness all over the world.  Many people who have lost friends, partners, and relatives to AIDS create panels commemorating their loved ones, and volunteers sew the panels together.  The quilt was displayed for the first time in 1987 in the National Mall in Washington, D. C.  Today, it includes 45,000 panels, weighs 54 tons, and represents 88,000 people who have died from AIDS.<br /><br />I found it puzzling that Draper never reveals her parents' names, even now that her mother is gone.  Since her mother wanted her illness to be kept a secret, Nancy had no choice but to keep silent while her mother was still alive.  However, wouldn't it have served a broader symbolic purpose to reveal her mother's given name in the book?<br /><br />Still, I applaud Draper and her family for their determination in steadfastly fighting back against an often heartless medical establishment.  It took courage to write this painful and heart-wrenching account of one family's struggle against a scourge that is still taking lives all over the world.ject, which was started in the 1980's to raise AIDS awareness all over the world.

Irving Yalom's marvelous new novel, \\"The Schopenhauer Cure,\\" is a wide-ranging and exhilarating exploration of psychotherapy, philosophy, and humanity.  Julius Hertzfeld is a respected therapist who learns that his days may be numbered.  Rather than retreat from life to lick his wounds and contemplate all that he must leave behind, Julius is determined to spend his remaining time continuing his psychotherapeutic work.  He decides to look up Philip Slate, a former patient whom he once treated for severe sex addiction.  Philip, one of Dr. Hertzfeld's most egregious failures, quit after three years of what he considered to be futile treatment.  Julius invites Philip, who now aspires to be a licensed counselor himself, to join his therapy group. Philip agrees and he brings some heavy baggage with him.<br /><br />\\"The Schopenhauer Cure\\" goes in several directions, but they all merge into a seamless whole.  Yalom invites the reader into the tumultuous world of Julius's group therapy sessions, and he delves a bit into the private lives of each member of Julius's group.  Pam is a college professor who has failed both in her marriage and in her adulterous relationship.  Rebecca has relied too much on her physical beauty, and as she ages, she must face the fact that her looks are slowly fading.  Tony is a carpenter whose rough exterior and lack of formal education hide an innate intelligence.  These and other members of the therapy group are thrown off stride by the shocking news of Julius's illness and by Philip's icy demeanor.<br /><br />To make matters even more complicated and interesting, Philip claims that he cured himself of his sex addiction by modeling his life after the great German philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer.  In a series of fascinating and informative chapters, Yalom traces the life and work of Arthur Schopenhauer, a brilliant but dour misanthrope whose seminal writings influenced Freud, Nietzche, and Sartre, among others.  Yalom brings Schopenhauer to life and the chapters dealing with this prickly genius provide a fascinating counterpoint to the conflicts and revelations that permeate the rest of the book.<br /><br />This story of people stripping away their defenses and baring their souls to one another gives valuable insight into the therapeutic process.  Yalom's writing is witty, highly intelligent, and imbued with compassion.  There are many touching passages and one, in particular, left me profoundly moved.

All of your favorite characters are here, such as Catbert the evil Human Resources Director, Dogbert, the consultant from hell, Alice, the triangular-haired harridan with the fist of death, and Wally, the laziest, most annoying, and most expendable worker imaginable. The characters all rant, rave, say really dumb things, and generally make pests of themselves.<br /><br />Some of the cartoons in this anthology are laugh-out-loud funny. At work, I got some annoyed glances when I chuckled audibly as I read this book. (I was on a break! I am not one of the shiftless workers that Scott Adams loves to depict!) Although not every cartoon is worthy of guffaws, the visuals are often terrific. I particularly love Wally's shapelessness, Dogbert's insouciance, pointy-haired boss's sheer pointy-headedness, and Alice's volcanic eruptions.<br /><br />Scott Adams has captured the spirit of corporate America in the pages of this book. It's all here--the cruelty, the idiocy, the waste, the animosity, and the sheer frustration of trying to survive when so many people are out to get you. My one quibble is that Scott Adams's comments do not add very much to the cartoons themselves. His work stands on its own merit, and \\"It's Not Funny If I Have to Explain It\\" would, ironically, be funnier without the explanations. Still, for Dilbert fans, this book is a treat. If you're downsized, it's something to read in your ample spare time.	2005-01-27

Mitch Albom's book of pop theology, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven,\\" is about an ordinary man named Eddie who dies on his eighty-third birthday.  Eddie was not a particularly happy man during his life.  He had a bad relationship with his father, he suffered a crippling injury during the war, and he spent many lonely years without loving companionship.  He worked as a maintenance man in an amusement park, a job that he inherited from his dad.  Eddie had always wanted to be an engineer, but nothing ever seemed to work out for him.<br /><br />Eddie proceeds to heaven where he meets five people who teach him life lessons.  Some of these people he knows; others are complete strangers.  He learns that everything, no matter how inexplicable, happens for a reason, that all lives are somehow connected, and that his existence on earth did indeed have meaning.  This novel is a natural follow-up to Albom's smash bestseller, \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" a non-fiction account of life lessons that the author learned from his former teacher, Morrie, an amazing and wise man who was afflicted with Lou Gehrig's Disease.<br /><br />As in \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" Albom's writing is simple yet affecting.  He talks of old-fashioned values such as forgiveness, compassion, sacrifice, and loyalty.  He also demonstrates that an ordinary man who works at a menial job, lives alone, and has few material possessions can still be a person of worth.  Although at times \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" borders on the sentimental, it has undeniable power.  We live in times of violence, uncertainty, rampant materialism, and an abandonment of basic moral values.  One reason that this book has struck a chord with the reading public is that Albom comforts us with the theme that death is not an end, but rather a beginning.  Although here on earth we may miss the big picture, there is hope that someday everything will become clear.	2005-01-25

It's timely, intricate, deeply psychological, action-packed, and suspenseful.  The heroine is Liz Carlyle, a member of M15, Britain's domestic military intelligence division.  She has risen in the ranks because she is super-competent, extremely sharp, and obsessed with being the best at what she does.  Liz has sacrificed the very idea of home and family; she is married to her job.<br /><br />When Liz gets together with her colleagues in the Joint Counter-Terrorism Group, she learns that Islamic terrorists may be deploying an \\"invisible\\" to stage an attack in Great Britain.  An \\"invisible\\" is an individual who is Western in appearance and has the credentials to blend into his or her surroundings undetected by the authorities.  When the mysterious killing of a shadowy figure named Ray Gunter occurs soon after this information is released, alarm bells go off.  Gunter was shot with a special type of sophisticated weapon that would unavailable to an ordinary street thug.  In addition, Gunter may have been involved in the smuggling of illegal immigrants into England.  Could one of these illegals be a terrorist at large?  This gives Liz and her team all of the ammunition that they need to start an investigation into a possible act of violence to be carried out in the near future on English soil.<br /><br />The characters in \\"At Risk\\" are all skillfully depicted. Besides Liz, there is her steady boss, Wetherby, who seems to understand Liz better than she does herself.  Much to her chagrin, Liz is suddenly forced to work with Bruno Mackay, a member of M16, Britain's foreign military intelligence division, who knows a great deal about the Pakistani terrorist scene.  Mackay is an arrogant and handsome man who is as supercilious as he is charismatic.  In addition, Rimington goes to great pains to delve into the minds of the terrorists.  Rather than dismissing them as crazed and suicidal ideologues, she shows them to be troubled individuals whose agenda has as much to do with deep emotional pain as it does with political and religious philosophy.  This gives \\"At Risk\\" a depth and complexity that run-of-the-mill spy thrillers often lack.<br /><br />Rimington has a smooth and fast-paced style.  The dialogue is funny, biting, hard-hitting, and realistic.  Since Rimington worked for thirty years in Britain's Secret Service and was the first female director general of M15, she knows a great deal about subversion, espionage, and counter-terrorism.  Therefore, it is not surprising that \\"At Risk\\" is filled with fascinating details about the workings of England's various security organizations.<br /><br />With all this, \\"At Risk\\" would not have worked half as well if Rimington weren't such a terrific storyteller.  She plunges us into a dark and forbidding world of hatred, vengeance, murder, and desperation, and she provides no pat answers for the problems posed in the book.  \\"At Risk\\" is one of the best spy novels of the year and I recommend it highly.individuals whose agenda has as much to do with deep emotional pain as it does with political and religious philosophy.

Lisa Gardner's new novel of suspense, \\"Alone,\\" is, to a major extent, about people who have survived terrible childhood traumas that have left them emotionally scarred.  One of these people is Catherine Gagnon.  As a child, she was abducted, molested, and kept in an underground cage for twenty-eight days.  Miraculously, Catherine was rescued and her attacker went to jail.  However, from that time on, she has never felt fully human.  Catherine's male counterpart is Massachusetts State Trooper Bobby Dodge.  Bobby's father was a violent drunk who drove his wife away, and Bobby has been carrying around a feeling of deep-seated rage towards his father and his absent mother for years.<br /><br />The lives of Catherine and Bobby converge when James Gagnon, Catherine's husband, is reported to the police for allegedly wielding a gun and threatening his wife and four-year-old son, Nathan.  Bobby, who is an expert sniper, is summoned to the scene, and he soon has the Gagnon family in his sights.  Should Bobby pull the trigger to save the wife and child or wait for instructions from his superiors?  Bobby's fateful decision will change his life forever.<br /><br />Lisa Gardner has a major following because she knows how to construct a compelling and fast-moving story.  We are drawn to Bobby's plight.  He is a decent and hard-working man who cannot sustain a long-term relationship with a woman, since he has never fully come to terms with the loss of his mother.  Catherine is a cipher.  Is she an innocent victim of a brutal husband or is she a manipulative schemer with a secret agenda of her own?  Adding to the mystery is Nathan Gagnon's poor health. Catherine's son has never gained weight and grown as a normal boy should, yet the doctors can find nothing specifically wrong with the child.<br /><br />So far so good.  Unfortunately, Gardner steers her book in the wrong direction when she overcomplicates her plot.  She throws in everything but the kitchen sink, and I'm sure if I look hard enough, I'll find the sink.  The man who molested Catherine, Richard Umbrio, is suddenly and mysteriously released from prison.  Who engineered his parole and what is Umbrio up to?  Probably nothing good.  Meanwhile, Catherine's in-laws, Judge James and Maryanne Gagnon, hate Catherine and they are desperate to destroy their daughter-in-law's life.  Why are they so cruel to her?<br /><br />As bodies start piling up and as Bobby's and Catherine's lives deteriorate further, \\"Alone\\" crosses the line from taut thriller to unrealistic melodrama. Too bad.  Gardner knows how to build tension and I was looking forward to the exciting conclusion of the story.  I enjoyed the well-written scenes between Bobby and his psychiatrist, Dr. Lane, in which he is forced to confront his demons for the first time.  There are also several action sequences that are genuinely scary.  However, Gardner's writing falters as the book reaches its far-out conclusion. Although \\"Alone\\" had the potential to be a first-rate novel, it doesn't quite make the grade.d the sink.

David Cray's previous novels were somewhat dark and character driven.  I liked the intricate plotting and exploration of the human psyche in Cray's compelling \\"Little Girl Blue\\" and \\"What You Wish For.\\"  Therefore, I was happily anticipating his latest effort, \\"Dead is Forever,\\" thinking that it would be another book along these lines.  Unfortunately, this time around, Cray branches out in a entirely new and unproductive direction.<br /><br />The hero of \\"Dead is Forever\\" is Philip Beckett, the maverick son of a wealthy but remote titan of industry.  In spite of having a Harvard and Wharton Business School education, Philip refuses to work for his father; therefore Regina, his ambitious sister, has taken over the role of heir apparent to the Beckett mantle of power.  Against his better judgment, Philip is dragged back into the family's affairs when his cousin's wastrel of a husband, Count Sergio D'Alesse, is found dead of a gunshot wound.  Sergio was a compulsive gambler with large debts that he could not repay.  Who killed him and why?  Philip, who is a licensed private investigator, looks into the case, fearing that a member of his family may be involved.  When other people connected with the case also turn up dead, Philip puts himself and his girlfriend in danger by stubbornly continuing to pursue leads.<br /><br />\\"Dead is Forever\\" has many weaknesses, including cutesy dialogue, pedestrian writing, and a tepid plot.  I was never interested in the cardboard Philip or in his venal and selfish relatives, and I was not invested in the outcome of the case.  The denouement, in which Philip gathers the suspects in a room and explains his thoughts about who committed the crimes, is reminiscent of a half-baked Hercules Poirot novel without Agatha Christie's wit and cleverness.  Please, Mr. Cray, go back to your thriller roots.  It's what you do best.	2005-01-17

She assured me that the reviews were mostly negative.  Since I do not read other reviews until after I have written my own, I decided to try \\"The Broker\\" and make up my own mind.  I'm glad I did. \\"The Broker\\" is Joel Backman, a high-powered lobbyist who puts the almighty dollar ahead of almost everything else in his life.  He disposes of wives like tissue paper, he ignores his children, and he forms short-term relationships with one gorgeous woman after another.  When he attempts to broker a deal involving a sophisticated satellite surveillance system, he gets in over his head with disastrous results.<br /><br />John Grisham again explores his recurring theme of the lone man against the establishment.  In this case, the lone man is an amoral person who has never given a moment's thought to the far-reaching consequences of his selfishness.  Because of the politically sensitive information that Backman is hiding, assassins in China, Russian, Israel, and Saudi Arabia may have targeted him for death. It seems that Joel may not have very much time to atone for his sins.<br /><br />Suddenly, Backman's life is turned upside down.  For reasons that are unclear to him, he is suddenly pardoned after six years in prison, and he hides out in Italy under the watchful eye of the CIA.  He studies Italian, eats in a variety of restaurants, and he once again learns the value of fresh air, nice scenery, a good meal, and a kind word.  Can Backman belatedly make a new life for himself before an assassin quickly ends it?<br /><br />Grisham's easygoing and fluid writing style makes this book a pleasure to read.  I loved the scenes in Italy.  Grisham captures the flavor of the country and its people, and he effortlessly shows us how Joel slowly adjusts to an existence that is unlike anything he has experienced before.<br /><br />The characters are all beautifully depicted. Teddy Maynard, the Director of the CIA, is a malevolent tyrant who is Machiavellian in his ability to manipulate people.  Neal Backman, Joel's son, is commendably loyal to his old man in spite of the disgrace that Joel has brought on his family.  Francesca, one of Joel's Italian language instructors, is a courageous and compassionate woman who teaches Joel more than just her language.<br /><br />I enjoyed many aspects of this novel, including the humorous and entertaining dialogue, intriguing spycraft, and complex political maneuvering.  What is blessedly missing is gratuitous sex and violence.  \\"The Broker\\" manages to be engrossing without the obligatory obscenity, titillation, and bloodshed that are de rigueur in many of today's novels.  Without preaching, Grisham brings home the message that a good life is measured not by the sum total of our bank accounts but by the moral values that guide our actions.tor of the CIA, is a malevolent tyrant who is Machiavellian in his ability to manipulate people.

Nick Hornby's \\"The Polysyllabic Spree\\" is an entertaining collection of essays about why Hornby buys so many books, reads some of them, and fails to read or finish others. Hornby gives his \\"varnished\\" opinion about what he has read. Why? It is part of the creed of \\"The Believer,\\" the publication for which he writes, that he is not allowed to be too snarky. Therefore, he cannot give his unvarnished opinion lest he be called to task, or even worse, fired. This is an intensely personal book that feels as if Hornby is sitting on our living room couch and conversing with us. It is hilarious, thoughtful, and delightfully tongue-in-cheek.<br /><br />\\"The Polysyllabic Spree\\" is a slim book that you can knock off in a day. The essays are divided by month. In each chapter, Hornby lists the books he has purchased and completed that month. He then proceeds to explain his choices and gives a quick critique of what he has read. In a few cases, Hornby includes excerpts from his readings. To say that his literary tastes are eclectic is a huge understatement. He includes not only fiction and poetry, but also a book about the economics of putting together a winning baseball team, a sociological study of two women living in the Bronx, a best-seller about punctuation, and a book about how to quit smoking.<br /><br />Hornby gives the reader a glimpse into his family life, as well; he describes the ups and downs of living with an autistic son. (He includes several books about autism in his readings.) Although I did not entirely agree with his criticism of Zoe Heller's \\"What was She Thinking?\\" or Mark Haddon's \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,\\" I was in total agreement with Hornby on Dennis Lehane's \\"Mystic River,\\" which he and I both adored. Whether or not you and Hornby are on the same page as far as literary criticism is concerned, if you are a bibliophile, you'll most likely find something in this book to amuse or divert you. As an added incentive, all proceeds of the book go to two worthy charities.wo worthy charities.	2005-01-16

In Howard Roughan's thriller, \\"The Promise of a Lie,\\" psychologist David Remler is still mourning the death of his beloved wife, Rebecca, who was killed in a car accident three years earlier.  David is a compassionate and dedicated professional who finds comfort in his work.  One day, a beautiful patient who calls herself Samantha Kent comes to see Dr. Remler.  Samantha sets in motion a complicated series of events that culminate in Remler's being charged with the murder of Conrad Birch, Kent's husband.  The doctor frantically tries to convince the police that he has been framed, but his protestations fall on deaf ears.<br /><br />Dr. Remler, the first person narrator, is an intelligent, witty, charming and sympathetic protagonist.  The secondary characters are lively as well.  Terry Garrett and Victor Glass are two top-notch defense attorneys who give David hope that he can escape the frame-up.  Other notable characters are a crusty old judge named Lomax, a highly skilled and somewhat shady computer hacker, and an eccentric billionaire and philanthropist named Arnold Kesper.  These people all play key roles in determining David's fate.<br /><br />Roughan writes with panache and he manages to make an improbable plot seem plausible.  \\"The Promise of a Lie\\" is fast-moving and suspenseful, and I enjoyed the entertaining mix of romance, courtroom theatrics, and surprising twists and turns.  This book is a winner from a very talented author.	2005-01-11

This time, he tried to rape a Swedish exchange student and when she fought back, he brutally injured her. In another case, a crew at a construction site in Greenwich Village unearths the skeletal remains of a woman who was buried alive. It turns out that the killer may have had an obsessive interest in the works of the great American writer, Edgar Allan Poe.<br /><br />Alexandra Cooper, the recurring character in Fairstein's novels, runs the sex crimes prosecution unit of the Manhattan DA's office. She works with her good friend, Mercer Wallace, who is a member of the police department's Special Victims Squad. Alex and Mercer's colleague, Mike Chapman, is a sharp homicide detective who enjoys teasing Alex mercilessly. All three become embroiled in the case of the entombed skeleton, and when more bodies pile up, they realize that the killer is still at large and eager to cover his tracks.<br /><br />Fairstein's knowledge of police procedure and the criminal justice system lends a touch of realism to the proceedings. She effectively describes the emotional and physical torment that the victims of sex crimes suffer, as well as the difficulties facing the prosecutors who try to bring the offenders to justice. Cooper's handling of the \\"Silk Stocking Rapist\\" case is well done and makes for compelling reading.<br /><br />The second case, which deals with the madman who buried a woman alive, is not as tight or as realistic. This case leads Alex and her colleagues to learn quite a bit about Edgar Allan Poe's life and works, including the fact that he once lived in New York City. This plot, however, has a number of holes and far too many coincidences to be convincing. The large cast of characters, including a randy professor, a disgraced policeman, a venal psychiatrist, and a frightened businessman, are one-dimensional and underdeveloped.

In Robert Wilson's new book, \\"The Vanished Hands,\\" Inspector Jefe Javier Falcon, the chief of the Seville homicide squad in Spain, has a particularly nasty case to investigate.  A wealthy businessman, Rafael Vega, and his wife, Lucia, are found dead in their luxurious home.  At first glance, it looks like a straightforward case of murder/suicide, but Falcon has his doubts.<br /><br />Rafael Vega worked in construction and he had ties to the Russian mafia.  He was suffering from anxiety and panic attacks, and his wife was an emotional wreck.  The couple's marriage had been deeply troubled for a long time.  Could Vega have killed his wife and then himself?  As Falcon's inquiries continue, he learns that Rafael Vega was hiding many ugly secrets that could have ultimately led to his death.<br /><br />Robert Wilson's textured writing makes \\"The Vanished Hands\\" an intriguing and tense psychological thriller.  Wilson effectively explores the weaknesses and vulnerabilities that cause people to act in self-destructive ways, harming not only themselves but also those closest to them.  This book has an aura of melancholy, since it deals with such weighty themes as child abuse, political torture, and infidelity.<br /><br />Wilson has a deft way with characterization, and this book has quite a cast.  Javier Falcon is a man of tremendous integrity, who is willing to lay his career on the line to see that justice is done.  His ex-wife, Ines, is engaged to Juez Esteban Calderon, a duty judge who is also a known womanizer.  Falcon's  therapist, Alice Aguado, helps to keep Falcon on an even emotional keel and she also assists Javier with other cases that he is pursuing.  One of Rafael Vega's neighbors, Consuelo Jimenez, is a well-to-do and beautiful widow to whom Javier is attracted, but he has always been unlucky in love.  Finally, Marty and Maddy Krugman are an odd couple who may know more than they are telling about the deaths of Rafael and Lucia Vega.  Marty is almost two decades older than his voluptuous wife, who reflexively comes on to almost every man she meets.<br /><br />\\"The Vanished Hands\\" is about coping with psychological pain and trying to find contentment in a flawed world.

Philip Roth's \\"The Plot Against America\\" explores what might have happened if the heroic aviator, Charles Lindbergh, had defeated FDR in the 1940 presidential election. This somewhat autobiographical story is told from the viewpoint of seven-year-old Philip Roth, a precocious youngster living in a Jewish neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey, with his parents, Herman and Bess, and his older brother, Sandy.<br /><br />Roth makes some wise choices in this terrific novel. He focuses on the everyday events in the lives of the Roth family, such as Philip's dedication to his budding stamp collection and Sandy's natural ability to sketch just about anything. By telling his story through the eyes of the intelligent and sensitive Philip, Roth makes the scenario of a United States under a Fascist administration seem entirely possible and incredibly frightening.<br /><br />Among the memorable characters in this book are Philip's cousin, Alvin, an orphan who is raised by Herman and Bess Roth. Alvin goes to Canada to fight against Hitler, since Lindbergh refuses to involve the United States in World War II. Alvin's decision to go to war has far reaching consequences for the Roth family. Another compelling character is Rabbi Lionel Bengelsdorf, an erudite and well-spoken man who believes that Lindbergh is actually a friend of the Jews. Bengelsdorf takes a position in the Office of American Absorption, an organization designed to get Jews out of the \\"ghettos\\" and force them to assimilate into mainstream America. Herman Roth hates Bengelsdorf, whom he believes to be delusional and a traitor to Jews everywhere.<br /><br />The Plot Against America\\" is a tapestry of the United States in the forties, with many references to popular culture and historical figures. Roth integrates real and imaginary events so seamlessly that he includes a postscript in which he delineates where fact leaves off and fiction begins. However, this book is more than just a history lesson and a warning that we should never become complacent. It is also a poignant coming of age story in which a young boy learns that, as much as his parents love him and want to protect him, there are sometimes powerful forces at work that even his mother and father cannot control. \\"The Plot Against America\\" is a mesmerizing book about courage, integrity, and the necessity to be forever vigilant in case what can't possibly happen here actually does.ould never become complacent.

Dr. Earl Garnet is back in \\"The Inquisitor,\\" Peter Clement's new medical thriller. Earl has had his problems with the medical establishment in the past, but he is now in a position to call some of the shots himself. Garnet is not only head of the emergency room at Buffalo's St. Paul's Hospital, but he is also vice president of the medical department, second only to the CEO of the hospital in power. He is a dedicated and compassionate doctor who is married to his beautiful colleague, Janet, an OB-GYN awaiting the birth of their second child.<br /><br />Garnet's problems have not evaporated since Clement's last book. St. Paul's is close to the Canadian border, and the hospital has SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) cases from tourists traveling back and forth between the United States and Canada. Everyone, including patients, must wear masks in order to prevent the spread of infection. The SARS scare has made everyone edgy and frightened, especially since some of St. Paul's medical personnel have died from the dreaded disease.<br /><br />\\"The Inquisitor\\" of the title is a psychotic individual who is obsessed with finding out from dying people what they see when they \\"pass over\\" to the other side. This person sneaks into the hospital rooms of extremely sick patients and brings them close to death in order to record their final words. Unfortunately, he or she can't always bring them back, and some of them die before their time. The \\"psycho\\" segments, told in the first person, in which this crazed person talks about his or her actions and motivations, are heavy-handed and way over the top. These portions of the book do not mesh well with the lively dialogue and light-hearted banter that make the rest of the novel so readable.<br /><br />Along with the heroic Garnet, \\"The Inquisitor\\" features a wide and varied cast of characters.  Jane Simmons, known as J. S., is a terrific emergency room nurse who is content on the job but unhappy with her personal life.  Although Dr. Stewart Deloram is a miracle worker in the ICU, his colleagues dislike him for taking offense at the slightest insult. Father Jimmy Fitzpatrick is a warm and amiable priest who goads Earl into assisting terminal patients who get insufficient medication to alleviate their pain. Earl orders extra meds for a cancer patient, and she subsequently dies from a morphine overdose. Did Earl's interference lead to this woman's death?<br /><br />Clement captures the ambience of a hospital very well. He explains medical terminology clearly and keeps the book moving at a fast pace. The author includes quite a few red herrings to throw the reader off the scent. The ending, however, is awkward, with too many crises occurring one after another, and too many illogical twists and turns that lead to an overly pat conclusion. In spite of these flaws, \\"The Inquisitor\\" is a workmanlike novel whose strengths are its lively characters and its realistic portrayal of how doctors function in a hospital setting.a miracle worker in the ICU, his colleagues dislike him for taking offense at the slightest insult.

Before he became a priest, Ramon dated a beautiful woman named Maria Concepcion. Twenty years later, Father Ramon presides over his congregation at St. Peter's in San Francisco and Maria is a lawyer. Although they are no longer romantically involved, the two remain close friends.<br /><br />Maria is a tightly wound woman who is at war with the San Francisco Archdiocese. She has brought numerous suits against a number of Catholic priests for both sexual and financial improprieties, and although she has never won a case in court, she has been able to garner substantial settlements for her clients. She is currently involved in another high profile lawsuit, and this time she refuses to accept the archdiocese's generous offer. For a variety of personal and professional reasons, Maria is on edge and suffers from recurring bouts of depression. One night, after Father Aguirre visits a distraught Maria in her apartment, she is found dead with her wrists slashed. The medical examiner rules her death a homicide, and the police arrest Father Ramon.  Mike Daley and Rosie Fernandez are old friends of Father Ramon and they take his case pro bono.<br /><br />\\"The Confession\\" is written in the first person from Mike's point of view. He constantly inserts sarcastic comments to give the reader his own take on whatever is going on. Sometimes these asides are amusing; often, they are irritating. Mike and Rosie face formidable obstacles, including nasty church politics and a client who has been less than forthcoming with his attorneys. They go to court with little confidence that they will be able to get Ramon off the hook.<br /><br />Mike and Rosie are well-meaning and likeable and the courtroom scenes are entertaining. However, I didn't for an instant believe that a priest as naive as Father Ramon could possibly exist, nor did I find the outcome of the story credible.  Siegel's characters are mostly unsavory types, including Eduardo, Maria's ex-lover, John Shanahan, a pompous and overbearing lawyer representing the church's interests, and assorted criminals who know more about Maria's death than they are willing to let on. \\"The Confession\\" is an average legal thriller with some lively moments, but because of several gaping plot holes, I give it a marginal recommendation.

Alice Glendenning is having a bad life in \\"Alice in Jeopardy,\\" by Ed McBain.  Her husband, Eddie, accidentally drowned eight months earlier while sailing on his boat, leaving his wife with two young kids to support.  Alice's son, Jamie, has not spoken a word since his father died.  Since Eddie's body was never recovered, the life insurance company has so far refused to pay out the substantial settlement that Alice is expecting.  In addition, a woman recently ran over Alice's foot with her car, breaking Alice's ankle. Now, Alice's savings are almost all gone and she is trying to make ends meet by selling houses.  Unfortunately, as yet, she hasn't sold a single home.  Can things get any worse?<br /><br />It turns out that they can.  One day, instead of going home on the school bus, Alice's kids get into a car with a strange woman.  Alice later gets a call from a kidnapper who says that she has the kids, and that she will kill them if Alice doesn't turn over a large ransom.  When the police and the FBI come calling, they turn out to be clumsy and ineffectual, and Alice is terrified that her kids will die.<br /><br />Ed McBain's cynicism and dry sense of humor are on full display in this breezy and fast moving crime novel.  The cops resemble the Keystone variety; although they mean well, their ineptitude and bungling may lead to disaster.  Alice is a smart woman with good instincts and a fierce love for her children.  She correctly concludes that the police are more of a hindrance than a help.  Alice's low-life brother in law, Rafe, an ex-con, makes an appearance, and she gets moral support from her friend, Charlie, and her sister, Carol.  However, when push comes to shove, Alice feels that she is all alone in the world and she may have to solve this crime herself if she is ever to see her kids again.<br /><br />\\"Alice in Jeopardy\\" is not a great novel.  The characters are hastily drawn, the plot has several predictable elements, and the story line has one too many illogical twists and turns.  However, McBain can write a decent novel in his sleep, and he manages to keep everything going with witty dialogue, lots of action, and a satirical look at the way that some law enforcement officers and members of the media put their own interests ahead of helping others.  I have always suspected that McBain is a bit of a misanthrope, and \\"Alice in Jeopardy\\" once again supports McBain's thesis that it is impossible to overestimate people's greed, selfishness, and stupidity.However, McBain can write a decent novel in his sleep, and he manages to keep everything going with witty dialogue, lots of action, and a satirical look at the way that some law enforcement officers and members of the media put their own interests ahead of helping others.

John Lescroart's new legal thriller, \\"The Motive,\\" once again features Dismas Hardy, criminal defense attorney extraordinaire, and his good friend, Abe Glitsky, who is now deputy chief of inspectors in the San Francisco Police Department.  Hardy and Glitsky both become involved in an ugly case of double homicide and arson.  Apparently the wealthy and influential Paul Hanover and his girlfriend, Michelle (Missy) D'Amiens, were both shot in the head in their new home.  Subsequently, the killer torched the house and the victims' bodies were burned beyond recognition.<br /><br />The mayor of San Francisco, Kathy West, asks Abe to look into the case on her behalf.  Abe's interference infuriates Dan Cuneo, who is the official investigator, and Cuneo resolves to find the killer quickly without Abe's input.  Dismas Hardy gets into the mix because of an old girlfriend who begs him for legal assistance.  On its face, this seems to be an open and shut case of greed and revenge.  After all, Paul Hanover was threatening to give his considerable fortune to his new trophy wife, leaving nothing to his ex-wife, three grown children, and their families.  Wouldn't Hanover's family have the most compelling motive to kill Paul before he changed his will in favor of Missy?<br /><br />Lescroart does a masterful job of setting up his characters and plot.  \\"The Motive\\" is a lively mix of political machinations, police procedure, courtroom drama, and an examination of the characters' personal lives.  Although the book is four-hundred pages long, it moves quickly and holds the reader's interest throughout.<br /><br />Alas, Lescroart falls victim to the bugaboo of thriller writers, the \\"absurd ending syndrome.\\"  Without giving away anything, I will merely say that \\"The Motive\\" ultimately falls flat because of startling revelations out of left field that make little sense.  Still, most of the novel is compelling, exciting, and intense drama, and I give Lescroart four stars for almost pulling it off.lling it off. <br />	2004-12-19

Roisin McAuley's affecting and poignant first novel, \\"Singing Bird,\\" is an engrossing story of a mother and daughter who were both adopted as babies. The mother, Lena Molloy, waited until adulthood to inquire about her birth parents, but she was unable to learn who they were. Mary, the daughter whom Lena adopted in Ireland, seems content with the idea that she may never know who gave her up for adoption. At twenty-seven, Mary is now a talented and beautiful singer who is a rising star in the opera world.<br /><br />Lena and her husband Jack are about to move into a new home, and they are looking forward to retirement in a few years. They are financially successful and have a second home in France. Lena and Jack have had a good marriage and they are bursting with pride at their daughter's success in the music world.<br /><br />Suddenly, Lena gets a phone call from the nun who gave Mary to her so many years ago. This phone call turns Lena's life upside down. She makes the fateful decision to take a vacation in Ireland with her friend, Alma. While in Ireland, Lena plans to spend some time searching for the names of Mary's birth parents. Lena has no idea that by doing so, she may be playing with fire.<br /><br />\\"Singing Bird\\" is filled with vivid and intriguing characters. Lena is an adoring wife and mother who has a hole in her heart because she longs to know the names of her natural parents. Her curiosity about her own origins drives her to learn about her daughter's birth parents, as well. Other memorable characters are Sister Monica, the crusty nun who contacts Lena after twenty-seven years of silence, and Alma, Mary's intelligent and often sarcastic best friend, who is unhappily involved in a dead-end affair with a married man.<br /><br />McAuley is a natural storyteller. Her writing flows effortlessly, and she uses foreshadowing very cleverly to give the reader small clues about what is to come. \\"Singing Bird\\" has romance, gentle humor, beautiful descriptive writing about Ireland, and heart-tugging suspense. As Lena gets closer to the truth, the book is impossible to put down.<br /><br />The biggest weaknesses in \\"Singing Bird\\" are the author's use of coincidence and her slightly pat ending. However, these small flaws do not detract from the warmth and compassion of this compelling story that will touch many readers, whether they are adopted or not. \\"Singing Bird\\" is a wonderful achievement by a very gifted writer.iptive writing about Ireland, and heart-tugging suspense.

I have always loved grammar and I frequently agonize over the proper use of punctuation in my writing.  Truss's book is all about punctuation, its use and abuse.  She also provides some enjoyable tidbits about the history of punctuation marks and how the use of punctuation is changing because of such modern phenomena as emailing and text messaging.<br /><br />Poor punctuation is the result of ignorance, laziness, and indifference.  Truss peppers her book with amusing examples of how incorrect punctuation can change the meaning of a sentence.  She also reveals that Gertrude Stein abhorred punctuation marks, Emily Dickinson was in love with the dash, and Virginia Woolf had a thing for semicolons.  No matter how one feels about individual punctuation marks, a good writer must learn the proper use of commas, quotation marks, apostrophes, parentheses, and ellipses.  Poorly placed punctuation marks often lead to unintentionally hilarious writing that brands the author as careless or, worse, an ignoramus.  Properly placed punctuation marks help the writer to communicate his message to the reader unambiguously.<br /><br />Why is Truss's book such a sensation?  One reason is that it's immensely entertaining.  Truss uses sarcasm, hyperbole, and wicked wit to make her case for accurate punctuation.  Another reason for the book's popularity is that Truss is standing up for old-fashioned correctness, and that is a novelty in itself.  We are living in an age of \\"anything goes.\\"  Standards of dress, speech, decorum, and behavior are all being thrown out the window.  It is comforting to know that there are people like Lynne Truss at the ramparts, battling for the cause of proper punctuation usage at a time when few people care about the niceties of language at all.  Hooray for Lynne Truss!  She's my hero.	2004-12-13

Natasha Cooper's new Trish Maguire mystery, \\"Keep Me Alive,\\" is a mixture of intrigue, action, and psychological suspense.  Trish is a talented barrister who, along with her head of chambers, Antony Shelley, is trying a case on behalf of Will Applewood and other British food producers.  Applewood and his fellow plaintiffs are claiming that a large supermarket chain breached a verbal contract with them.  It is a complex and messy case, and Trish becomes more emotionally involved in the outcome than she should.<br /><br />While her lover is away on holiday, Trish is living alone and loving it.  However, her tranquility is shattered when she and a close friend, Caro, come down with a case of food poisoning.  Trish gets off lightly, but Caro's case is quite serious and potentially life threatening.  Trish also gets embroiled in the investigation of a journalist's mysterious death that may be tied to a scandal in the meat industry. Finally, Trish is asked to interview a little girl named Kim who may be the victim of serious abuse at home.<br /><br />Natasha Cooper skillfully balances all of her plot elements and she fleshes out her characters with care.  Trish comes across as supremely confident and self-contained, but when she interviews Kim, she remembers her own sad and damaging childhood.  Trish understands only too well how this terrified little girl feels. Will Applewood, the plaintiff in Trish's case, is a vulnerable man whose livelihood hangs in the balance.  If his court case fails, he is in danger of losing not only his income but also his dignity.  Cooper focuses a great deal on Will and she brings a feeling of immediacy to his story that makes it seem real and poignant.<br /><br />Cooper's dialogue is sharp, and whether her scenes take place in a courtroom or in a remote field with villainous thugs up to no good, she brings credibility to her writing.  Natasha Cooper is a versatile author who is also a terrific storyteller, and \\"Keep Me Alive\\" is a fast moving and involving thriller..	2004-12-12

Anita Shreve's \\"Light on Snow\\" is a thoughtful and understated novel about a father and daughter who suffer a great tragedy.  Robert Dillon is a New York-based architect whose wife and baby daughter die in a car accident.  Robert subsequently quits his job and retreats to an isolated house in Shepherd, New Hampshire with his resentful twelve-year-old daughter, Nicky.<br /><br />Nicky and her father soon get used to the wintry climate and rural atmosphere of their new home.  One day, while out for a walk, Robert and Nicky find an abandoned newborn baby freezing in the snow.  Who are the baby's parents and how could they leave their baby to die?  Finding this baby will have far reaching consequences for the Dillon family.<br /><br />\\"Light on Snow\\" is written in the first person, from Nicky's point of view.  This preteen is a compassionate child who has keen insight and surprising poise.  She handles both her own conflicts and those of her father with a maturity that belies her age.  Nicky gradually changes from a little girl to a young woman ready to face the difficult challenges that lie ahead of her.<br /><br />Shreve's lyrical prose perfectly captures the atmosphere of rural New Hampshire, which is bitterly cold, icy, and forbidding, much like the inner lives of Shreve's characters.  Shreve is one of the few authors writing today who expresses sentiment without ever becoming sentimental.  She observes her characters with calm detachment, and she never resorts to theatrics or melodrama.  In spite of a few contrived plot elements that weaken the novel a bit, \\"Light on Snow\\" is a poignant and engrossing story about love, grief, loss, and redemption.	2004-12-06

In Ian Rankin's \\"Witch Hunt,\\" the chase is as compelling as the outcome.  \\"Witch\\" is the code name for a female terrorist who has wreaked havoc during her bloody career.  She is an expensive hired assassin, and the only person who has come close to catching her is former British Intelligence Agent Dominic Elder.  Elder has a huge \\"W\\" shaped scar on his back as a souvenir of his close encounter with Witch.  There is fresh evidence that Witch has resurfaced and may be planning to kill a high-profile target in the near future.<br /><br />Joining Elder in the hunt are two men from Special Branch named Greenleaf and Doyle.  In addition, two novices, John Barclay and Dominique Herault, of British and French Intelligence respectively, are also eagerly putting their heads together to help find Witch before she strikes again.<br /><br />Rankin concentrates on the personalities of his characters as much as he does on plot.  Elder is bitter that Witch has eluded him in the past and he is anxious to get revenge.  He is allowed back into the case partly because his former boss, Joyce Parry, still has feelings for Elder, who used to be her lover.  Greenleaf and Doyle are uneasy partners who don't particularly care for one another.  Barclay and Herault are both young and eager, looking for adventure and finding it in their first major investigation.<br /><br />The search for Witch is complicated and time-consuming.  It stretches across England, Scotland, France, and Germany.  Every lead is followed up, especially since a summit is about to take place in London, with many dignitaries expected to attend.  Unfortunately, Witch is so quick and clever that she always manages to stay a step ahead of her pursuers.  Will they be able to run her to ground before she attempts her next assassination?<br /><br />Although it is a bit long and meanders occasionally, I enjoyed \\"Witch Hunt.\\"  Rankin explores the intricacies of both police and intelligence work, showing that patience, persistence, and luck are all factors in a successful outcome.  Witch is a fascinating uber-assassin, beautiful, changeable, brilliant, and ruthless.  Rankin takes pains to humanize her, however, and we learn how she came to be one of the world's most sought-after killers.  The ending is a nail-biter, filled with non-stop action and a few surprises to keep the reader off-balance.

Martin Cruz Smith's new novel, \\"Wolves Eat Dogs,\\" is a stylish and atmospheric story set in Russia and the Ukraine.  Pasha Ivanov, a super-rich member of New Russia's capitalist class, has plunged to his death from his Moscow condominium.  The authorities have ruled that Ivanov committed suicide.  However, a stubborn and sharp detective named Arkady Renko would like to dig deeper into the \\"whys\\" of Pasha's death.  His angry and corrupt boss, Prosecutor Zurin, has ordered Renko in no uncertain terms to close the case or lose his job.<br /><br />To get rid of Arkady, Zurin sends him to the Ukraine, not far from Chernobyl.  This was the site of one of the world's worst disasters, an explosion in a nuclear reactor that sent radioactive material into the atmosphere and made an entire region uninhabitable.  The ostensible reason that Zurin dispatched Renko to this place is to investigate the murder of a second mogul named Timofeyev, Pasha Ivanov's business partner.  Renko is handling the case on his own, and he seems doomed to fail.  However, he is determined to get to the bottom of these two mysterious deaths that have one thing in common.  Both men were contaminated by radiation before they died.<br /><br />Smith's writing is vivid and at times, devastatingly brutal.  He describes the area around Chernobyl, known as the Zone, so clearly that the reader can almost see the blunted trees, the blackened earth, and the desperate squatters who still live there in spite of the dangers of radiation exposure.  The characters in this novel are a fascinating bunch, including some researchers who do studies and deliver medical attention to the inhabitants, and assorted criminals and thugs who make a living on the backs of other people's misfortune.  There are also old people who stay near Chernobyl, in spite of the danger, because it is their home.  During this investigation, Renko's eyes are opened to the horrible corruption and mismanagement that made the accident in Chernobyl into a terrible calamity.<br /><br />Occasionally, Smith's writing is a little too oblique and the plot is sometimes difficult to follow.  Overall, however, the novel's strength and vigor make it a satisfying and unique reading experience.

Ken Follett's new book, \\"Whiteout,\\" is a hybrid that incorporates elements of a medical thriller, crime novel, and family drama. Toni Gallo is a former cop who is now the security director at a Scottish research facility called Oxenford Medical, where a top-secret antiviral drug is being developed. Also stored in the lab is a deadly virus that, if unleashed, could wipe out an entire population. In spite of Toni's precautions, the lab's security is compromised when a technician takes an infected animal home with him. Toni fears that her employer, Stanley Oxenford, will be enraged at her incompetence. Even if the virus is contained and no one dies, the adverse publicity may halt the vital and potentially life saving research being conducted by Oxenford's company.<br /><br />Follett's set up is engrossing and fast-paced. Toni is the prototypical beautiful and bright heroine. She loves her job and believes that she can institute better measures to protect Oxenford's research facility. She also secretly admires her employer, the much older Stanley Oxenford, a wealthy widower who is both brilliant and attractive.<br /><br />Many complications ensue that test Toni's courage and emotional strength. Stanley's adult children, whom he dotes on, react to Toni's interest in their father with thinly veiled bitterness and hostility. Even worse, there is more trouble at the lab, and this time, the consequences may be devastating.<br /><br />\\"Whiteout\\" is not great literature, but it is a guilty pleasure. The characters are lively and varied; they include a pair of hormonally charged teenagers, two couples in rocky relationships, and a bunch of criminals whose ineptitude and stupidity are matched only by their viciousness. All of these people come together in surprising ways, and there is a great deal of action-filled mayhem before the plot plays itself out.

Ruth Rendell once again proves that she is uniquely talented with \\"The Rottweiler,\\" her latest psychological thriller.  The title refers to a serial killer who, at first, was mistakenly thought to bite his female victims.  In truth, he doesn't bite the women he kills; he would rather not touch them at all.  He strangles them using cord or a similar object, and then takes a trinket from each body as a keepsake.<br /><br />\\"The Rottweiler\\" takes place in a London neighborhood, and much of the action revolves around an antiques shop owned by Inez, a widow who pines for her adored late husband, Martin.  Inez also rents out flats above her shop to an assorted group of tenants.  We gradually get to know a great deal about Inez, her tenants, and her gorgeous employee, Zeinab.<br /><br />Why is Rendell such a mesmerizing writer?  One reason is that she takes the time to delve into each character's mind and heart.  In the pages of this novel, we meet an unrepentant serial killer, a few thieves, a charlatan, and an alcoholic, among others, but Rendell does not merely use her characters as props.  She opens a window into each individual's personality, and she lays bare his or her weaknesses, strengths, vulnerabilities, hopes, and dreams. We may not like these people, but we understand them.<br /><br />Besides the serial killer plot, there is a poignant and heartbreaking subplot that deals with the plight of Will, a development disabled man who relies a great deal on his Aunt Becky for love and emotional support.  Becky is Will's only living relative, and although she cares for Will, she would like to live her own life, free of responsibility for this man-child.  However, she is crippled by guilt, and she can think of no way to break free of him.  As usual, Rendell writes with dark humor, cynicism, and deep insight into the many ways that people destroy themselves and others, and she holds the reader in the palm of her hand throughout.<br /><br />In Rendell's world, there is no such thing as fairness.  The good are not always rewarded for their virtue, nor are the evil always punished for their sins.  Why would we want to enter such a bleak universe?  The reasons are simple.  Rendell's effortless writing is both lucid and beautifully descriptive, she maintains a high level of suspense until the last page is turned, and she has an unusual and thought-provoking perspective on human nature.  That is why Rendell has always been in a class by herself.e good are not always rewarded for their virtue, nor are the evil always punished for their sins.

David Baldacci, judging by his new thriller, \\"Hour Game,\\" is suffering from a malady that afflicts far too many successful writers.  It is the \\"publish or perish\\" syndrome, which impels an author to keep churning out books at a fast clip.  This haste often adversely affects the quality of the product.<br /><br />The heroes of \\"Hour Game\\" are Sean King and his partner, Michelle Maxwell, former Secret Service agents who now work as private investigators.  King and Maxwell have been hired to look into the burglary of a private residence owned by the wealthy Battle family.  However, when the small town of Wrightsburg, Virginia, becomes the scene of a series of bizarre and grisly homicides, Police Chief Todd Williams deputizes King and Maxwell, and they officially join the hunt for a serial killer with a complex and obscure agenda.<br /><br />Normally, I finish a thriller in one or two days at most.  I kept putting \\"Hour Game\\" aside because it is tedious and filled with too many characters and far too many subplots.  At over four hundred pages, this novel's pace is too slow and there is insufficient payoff for the patient and long-suffering reader.<br /><br />Baldacci falls back on the old stereotype of the miserable and dysfunctional rich family, in this case Remmy and Bobby Battle and their children, Savannah and Eddie, all of whom have secrets and deep-seated psychological problems.

You may need a scorecard to sort everything out by the time you reach the long awaited conclusion.<br /><br />Baldacci does not define his characters very well, his dialogue is wooden, and the story that he tells is incredibly complicated and far-fetched.  \\"Hour Game\\" lacks the suspense, sharp writing, and satisfying character development that distinguished such early Baldacci books as \\"The Winner\\" and \\"The Simple Truth.\\"  In \\"Hour Game,\\" Baldacci does not deliver the goods, and I suggest that you skip this one.aldacci books as \\"The Winner\\" and \\"The Simple Truth.\\"  In \\"Hour Game,\\" Baldacci does not deliver the goods, and I suggest that you skip this one.	2004-11-14

Did Nedda kill this man in self-defense and is this incident somehow related to the nine murders that occurred so long ago?<br /><br />Kathy Mallory, the cold and brilliant cop who takes every crime very personally, is on the case.  Mallory and her detective partner, Riker, get to know the Winter family very well, and Mallory's friend, Charles Butler, lends his psychological expertise to assist the detectives.  Riker is particularly handy to have around because he is an expert on ice pick murders, as were his father and grandfather before him.<br /><br />Carol O'Connell has written an ingenious and intricate novel of psychological suspense.  She gives us just enough information to pique our curiosity, but we do not get the whole picture until the author is ready to reveal her secrets. O'Connell has a darkly humorous and cynical style.  Her best character is Mallory, a former street criminal turned cop, who uses her razor-sharp mind, ruthless interrogation skills, and her ability to lie with a straight face to good effect.  She can ferret out the truth from the most closed-mouth and hardened criminals.  The other characters, including the Winter family and Mallory's friends and colleagues, are also cleverly drawn.  I was intrigued by the baroque and puzzling ending of \\"Winter House,\\" which combines terrific police work, a touch of the supernatural, and enough twists and turns to send the inattentive reader into a tailspin.  This one is an original.police work, a touch of the supernatural, and enough twists and turns to send the inattentive reader into a tailspin.  This one is an original. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-14

The Palestinian terrorists are willing to commit any atrocity, including strapping explosives to themselves and detonating bombs in public places, in order to destroy and demoralize the Jewish people.  The issue of terrorism and its consequences drives the new and timely novel, \\"The Covenant,\\" by Naomi Ragen.<br /><br />Ragen draws a parallel between the Nazi terror during World War II and the Intifada in the Middle East.  Four women, Leah, Maria, Ariana, and Esther, met in Auschwitz, and they made a covenant that if they survive, they will join their lives together forever.  They do survive, and many years later, the four elderly women are in touch sporadically.  Leah's granddaughter, Elise Margulies, is living in Maaleh Sara, Judea, with her family.  Elise is devastated when Hamas terrorists kidnap her husband, Dr. Jonathan Margulies, and their daughter, Ilana.  Elise is pregnant and is in fragile health.  She knows that the Israeli authorities have a policy of not giving in to the terrorists' demands.  What will become of her family?<br /><br />Fortunately, grandmother Leah has powerful friends in the Covenant.  Esther Gold has made a fortune in the cosmetics industry and Ariana Feyder is a woman of vast influence who owns an exclusive cabaret in Paris.  Both women marshal their considerable forces to find Dr. Margulies and Ilana before it is too late.<br /><br />\\"The Covenant\\" works on some levels better than others.  Ragen's characters too often border on caricature.  The idea of rich and influential Jewish matrons who, with a few phone calls, can move mountains is an irritating stereotype.  A heavy-handed subplot deals with an aggressive and ambitious British reporter named Julia Greenberg who sympathizes with the Palestinian cause.  Will she get her comeuppance?<br /><br />The most effective flashbacks are those that take place in Auschwitz.  To research the events in this infamous concentration camp, Naomi Ragen listened to taped interviews by survivors who recorded their memories for the Shoah Visual History Foundation and for Yad Vashem in Jerusalem.  The scenes in Auschwitz are poignant and heartbreaking.<br /><br />The rest of the book is uneven.  There are too many characters and too many storylines and the book eventually loses some of its focus.  Ragen describes in detail how the terrorists plan to carry out their nefarious schemes.  In another subplot, the author explores the isolated life of Esther's granddaughter, Elizabeth, who has converted to Islam and spends six months a year in Saudi Arabia as the wife of a wealthy Arab, Whalid Ibn Saud.  Ragen also includes a young man named Milos, a Catholic filmmaker, who is the grandson of Maria, a member of the Covenant.  Maria convinces Milos to do whatever he can to help Elise.<br /><br />\\"The Covenant\\" would have been more effective had Ragen pared her story down to its essentials.  She goes too far afield, flitting from one place to another and from one character to another, and this reduces the story's impact.  I wholeheartedly agree with her message that terrorism is a cruel and inhuman way to make a political point.  However, a work of fiction must stand on its own, and cannot be judged on whether the author's heart is in the right place.us concentration camp, Naomi Ragen listened to taped interviews by survivors who recorded their memories for the Shoah Visual History Foundation and for Yad Vashem in Jerusalem.

Deborah Crombie's latest Gemma James/Duncan Kincaid mystery, \\"In a Dark House,\\" is a blend of three or four plot lines that seem unrelated but eventually converge.  Reading this novel is like looking through the lens of a kaleidoscope and wondering when the swirling colors and shapes will settle into a recognizable pattern.  Fortunately, Crombie is skilled at developing character and an expert at juggling all of her plot elements, and she carries the reader along effortlessly.<br /><br />Gemma James and Duncan Kincaid have settled into their new house with their children, Kit and Toby.  Although they are not married, Gemma and Duncan are a committed couple who have weathered many difficult times together.  Their main worry now is an impending court battle against Kit's maternal grandmother, who has filed suit to gain custody of her thirteen-year-old grandson. Kit's grandmother, Eugenia, claims that Duncan and Gemma, who are both Scotland Yard detectives, are too busy with their professional lives to take proper care of a child. Neither Gemma nor Duncan have any intention of surrendering Kit without a fight.<br /><br />\\"In a Dark House\\" is chock full of suspense and criminal mischief.  Superintendent Kincaid has been asked by his boss to investigate a suspicious fire and homicide, which may or may not be connected.  As a favor to Winnie Montfort, the wife of Duncan's cousin, Gemma looks into the sudden disappearance of a hospital administrator who had been sharing a house with Winnie's friend.  Later, both Duncan and Gemma are on the trail of a child abductor who has kidnapped a young girl but has not made a ransom demand.<br /><br />In lesser hands, this novel might have degenerated into a confusing and melodramatic jigsaw puzzle with too many pieces.  However, Crombie masterfully delineates each character clearly and succinctly, and she weaves the various plot threads together with a sure and deft touch.  Gemma and Duncan are wonderful protagonists.  They are brilliant and dedicated detectives, but they have learned over the years that it is a mistake to always put your job ahead of your family.<br /><br />The large cast of vivid characters includes Fanny Liu, a paralyzed woman who is panic-stricken when her flatmate, Elaine disappears, Rose Kearney, a young and ambitious firefighter who has the instincts of a keen investigator, and Dr. Tony Novak, whose bitter divorce from his wife, Laura, has put his beloved daughter, Harriet, at risk.  The villains are evil and chilling, and there are many twists and turns to keep the reader turning pages at a fast clip.<br /><br />As always, it is amazing that an American author like Crombie perfectly captures British dialect and atmosphere.  Her success as a novelist, however, stems from her deep understanding of human nature and her ability to tell engrossing stories that combine action, drama, poignancy, and tragedy.  She carefully leaves some loose ends untied, and I look forward to her addressing some of them in the next installment of this wonderful series.tives, but they have learned over the years that it is a mistake to always put your job ahead of your family.

Mark Rubin is a wealthy Baltimore furrier who has been married for ten years to Natalie, a strikingly beautiful woman twelve years his junior. Without warning, Natalie suddenly leaves with the children, a nine-year-old boy and five-year-old twins. A frantic Mark Rubin hires private investigator Tess Monaghan to find his family.<br /><br />Tess starts his investigation with a visit to Natalie's mother, Vera, a coarse individual who is so unfeeling that she offers to sell Tess information rather than provide it free of charge. As Tess digs deeper into the case, she discovers that both Mark and Natalie have shameful secrets that they have gone to great pains to conceal. These secrets hold the key to Natalie's otherwise inexplicable behavior.<br /><br />Laura Lippman is a talented writer, and Tess Monaghan is a delightful protagonist. She is witty, self-effacing, tough, smart, and persistent. The bantering between the religious Jew, Mark Rubin, and the half-Jewish Tess, is stimulating and entertaining. Mark has his own ideas about religion and marriage, and Tess challenges him at every turn. She believes that Rubin is living in a dream world, persisting stubbornly in his belief that Natalie loves him. A subplot about the marriage of Tess's Aunt Kitty to Tyner Gray provides some welcome comic relief. Kitty also prods Tess to reevaluate her shaky relationship with her absent boyfriend, Crow.<br /><br />\\"By a Spider's Thread\\" is an engrossing and fast-paced mystery with an intricate and involving plot that moves along at a quick pace. One weakness in the book, however, is Natalie. She is supposed to be a tough cookie who has been around the block a few times, but her behavior while she is on the run is too gullible and foolish to be believed. The ending has a couple of incongruities as well, especially when Tess has her back to the wall and doesn't use her head in a crucial situation. However, there are enough strengths in this book to recommend it, and I especially admire Lippman's exploration of the ways that secrets, lies, and self-delusion wreak havoc with people's lives.in a crucial situation.

Peter Thomas's debut novel, \\"Den of the Assassin,\\" explores some timely and frightening themes.  Thomas focuses on the instability in Russia, with its loose nukes, unemployed scientists, and disgruntled former Communists.  What if from this chaos, a madman emerges who has weapons of mass destruction and a diabolical plan to terrorize and enslave the free world?  What if this individual finds a way to control the major financial markets and also threatens to release a deadly biotoxin for which only he has the antidote?<br /><br />This scenario drives \\"Den of the Assassin,\\" which delves into the high-stakes world of investment banking.  The hero is Tyler Boxter, a rich and successful young man whose company, Constellation, is about to embark on a risky new venture.  Along with his partner, Tyler plans to change the way that healthcare is delivered in America.  If successful, Boxter's plan will help many people who are uninsured, and it will also make Tyler wealthy beyond his wildest dreams.  For a long time, Tyler is unaware that a megalomaniac, who goes by the code name \\"Father,\\" plans to use Tyler's ambitious undertaking to carry out his own nefarious plans.<br /><br />Peter Thomas has an encyclopedic and impressive knowledge of corporate takeovers, offshore banking, and the cutthroat atmosphere of the corporate boardroom.  Alas, these qualities cannot redeem \\"Den of the Assassin,\\" which is written in a heavy-handed and clich&eacute;-ridden style.  The villains are one-dimensional stereotypes, the love scenes are conventional, and the dialogue is wooden.  This novel would have benefited from strict editing that eliminated wordy and unnecessary scenes as well as annoyingly repetitive dialogue.  Although there are some suspenseful elements in this novel as well as a few gory action sequences, I did not find \\"Den of the Assassin\\" to be particularly engrossing or exciting.  Peter Thomas has some good ideas, but if he is to succeed in this genre, he would do well to sharpen, prune, and carefully edit his writing., prune, and carefully edit his writing. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-19

The inmates are given a great deal of freedom, considering that their mental problems are quite severe.  The goal of this facility is to reach these troubled teens and send them out into the world as potentially productive individuals.  Twenty-six years pass, and one by one, members of the Unit are dying, apparently by suicide, accident, or murder.  What is the connection between these seemingly unrelated deaths?<br /><br />Sue Walker has written an impressive debut novel that is an exciting and engrossing page-turner.  The author vividly portrays the troubled teens on the Unit, including Danny, a rapist at fourteen, Carrie, a drug-addict who was abused at home, Innes, a shoplifting truant who acts out to punish her overbearing mother, and Alex, a foul-mouthed and aggressive bully.  The scenes in the mental hospital are stark and brutal.  Walker captures the despair and anger that cause these young people to act destructively.<br /><br />These flashback scenes are much more effective than the scenes that take place in the present.  Walker dizzyingly moves from one character to another, showing us what has happened to them in the last two and a half decades.  In some cases, the disturbed teens grow up to become well-paid professionals, but, even as adults, they still have nightmares that never die.<br /><br />The weakest part of the book is the over-the-top ending, in which Walker crams too many melodramatic, unbelievable and violent events into a few pages.  The author reveals a \\"secret\\" that most attentive readers will have figured out for themselves long before.  Still, Walker gets high marks for her powerful and disturbing scenes in the Unit, and I look forward to more work from this talented writer.	2004-10-10

Chris Bohjalian specializes in the dissection of families in crisis.  In \\"Midwives\\" and \\"The Buffalo Soldier,\\" to name two of his best works, Bohjalian shows how previously happy families are brought low by the vicissitudes of life and by their own frailties.  \\"Before You Know Kindness\\" (a mushy title that does not do justice to this fine book) tells the story of the Seton clan.  Nan Seton is a widowed, wealthy, and endlessly energetic matriarch who spends her winters in her large apartment in Manhattan and her summers in the family home in New Hampshire.  Every summer, Nan invites her son and daughter, John and Catherine, along with their spouses and children, to spend some time with her.  Under Nan's direction, the family participates in an endless and dizzying round of athletic and social activities.<br /><br />The book opens with a horrifying scene in which Spencer McCullough, Nan Seton's son-in-law, is accidentally shot in the shoulder, and very nearly killed.  Spencer is an animal rights activist whose fanaticism on the subject is comic fodder for Bohjalian.  Whether he is forcing inedible foods down his family's throats or insisting that his relatives wear plastic shoes, not leather, Spencer is unyielding in his insistence that no living thing with a parent should be a source of food or clothing for human beings.  Spencer's overbearing personality and frequent absences from home have already alienated his wife, Catherine, who is ready to give up on her marriage.<br /><br />After the shooting, the entire family goes into shock.  This event shakes up everyone's comfortable assumptions about their lives and one another, and it forces them to reevaluate what is really important to them. Bohjalian is an expert at finding and articulating the telling detail that brings an event or an individual to life.  For example, in the prologue, Bohjalian immediately grabs the reader's attention by providing an extensive description of the bullet that hits Spencer, the anatomical damage that it inflicts, and the heroic efforts of the EMT's who fight to keep Spencer alive until he reaches the hospital.  The many scenes like this throughout the book draw the reader into the action, as if the author is engaged in an intense conversation with us in his living room.<br /><br />Chris Bohjalian is an intimate writer, who examines each character minutely, showing us both their strengths and weaknesses, but always preserving their humanity.  \\"Before You Know Kindness\\" is filled with gentle humor, sharp dialogue, and careful plotting.  My two quibbles are the book's length and the pat ending.  At over four hundred pages, the novel sags at times, and it could have been trimmed by at least fifty pages.  In addition, Bohjalian wraps up his story a bit too neatly. However, the author's deep understanding of both children and adults impresses me, and I love how he opens a window into each character's mind and heart.

Molly Blume is a true crime writer who is about to get married to the love of her life, Rabbi Zack Abrams.  Instead of concentrating on the last minute wedding details, however, Molly is preoccupied with an old crime.  Her best friend, Aggie Lasher, was brutally murdered six years earlier.  Recently, the police found the dead body of an ex-con named Randy Creeley, who apparently died of a drug overdose.  The authorities have reason to believe that Randy killed Aggie, and they are ready to close the case.<br /><br />However, after looking into the particulars of Randy's life and his relationship to Aggie, Molly has many unanswered questions.  She decides to investigate Aggie's death herself, and she interviews friends, relatives, and others who knew both Aggie and Randy. Molly Blume is a bright and tenacious reporter with good instincts, and she is indefatigable in her search for the truth. She becomes a thorn in the side of Andrew Connors, one of the detectives working the case. Her investigation leads her down a winding road, and she makes some shocking discoveries that shed new light on the case.<br /><br />Molly is a spunky and likeable heroine who places her own life on the line to learn the identity of Aggie's murderer.  The intricate plot is engrossing and filled with many unexpected twists and turns, and the author never resorts to offensive language or gratuitous violence to generate artificial excitement.  \\"Grave Endings\\" is a workmanlike and entertaining mystery that will please Krich's many fans.	2004-10-10

In \\"A Perfect Divorce,\\" he has created a recognizable modern family, Karen and Rob Burrows and their son Tommy.  Karen and Rob, who are based in New York City, both have fulfilling and satisfying careers, but their jobs leave them little time for one another.  When their marriage finally breaks down completely, Karen and Rob have a civilized and amicable divorce, and they pray that their son will not suffer because of their failure to stay together.<br /><br />What makes \\"A Perfect Divorce\\" stand out is Corman's determination not to resort to theatrics and melodrama. Rob is a respected and stable businessman who owns a company called MayPole that manufactures and sells playground equipment.  Rob's only vice is that he travels a great deal and spends too much time making contact with clients all over the country.  He is community-minded and even donates playground equipment to underprivileged kids.  Karen cultivates American craftspeople and she sells their unique wares in her beautiful store.  Tommy is a good and reliable kid, who is talented artistically but only average academically.  These are all fine and decent people who, mostly for logistical reasons, no longer function together as a unit.<br /><br />Corman encapsulates the dilemma of the modern, well-to-do family--too much time spent on careers, too little time devoted to family.  In flashback, Corman shows how Rob and Karen got together and how much they loved one another, and this makes their divorce all the more distressing.<br /><br />Much of the book focuses on Tommy, who does suffer greatly when his mother and father split up.  He is shuttled from one parent to the other until he can't take it anymore.  Karen and Rob pressure him to raise his SAT scores so that he will get into a good school.  Finally, much to his parents' horror, he decides to go his own way, ignoring Karen's and Rob's plans for his future.  While Tommy struggles to find himself, Karen and Rob seek new relationships, hoping that they can do better the second time around.<br /><br />The writing in \\"A Perfect Divorce\\" is wonderful.  All the characters are beautifully developed, the dialogue is funny, touching, and natural, and the plot is lively and nicely paced.  Corman shows how well-meaning people can mess up their lives without realizing how much damage they are causing.  It may take a village to raise a child, but it doesn't hurt to have two loving parents, with common goals and a deep commitment to one another.

Alexander McCall Smith, author of the tremendously successful and utterly enthralling series that began with \\"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,\\" has written a new novel set in Edinburgh.  \\"The Sunday Philosophy Club\\" features Ms. Isabel Dalhousie, a graduate of Cambridge and an independently wealthy woman of forty.  Isabel lives in a beautiful home, and her routine basically consists of working on her daily crossword puzzle, attending cultural events, visiting her beloved niece, Cat, and editing philosophical articles for \\"The Review of Applied Ethics.\\"<br /><br />One evening, Isabel is attending a performance by the Reykjavik Symphony in Usher Hall, when a man suddenly tumbles down from the top tier to his death.  Isabel is traumatized by this unexpected tragedy and she resolves to find out if the victim, Mark Fraser, was pushed or fell accidentally.<br /><br />Isabel noses into Mark's personal and professional life, and she discovers that his death may be related to some financial chicanery in his firm.  In addition, Isabel finds the time to interfere in her niece's romantic life. Cat is seeing a young man named Toby, a hunk whom Isabel dislikes and mistrusts.  She is determined to break up this relationship and bring about a reconciliation between Cat and her former boyfriend, Jamie, whom Isabel adores.<br /><br />\\"The Sunday Philosophy Club\\" is a pedestrian effort featuring a pretentious busybody who has far too much time on her hands.  The mystery that Isabel investigates is uninvolving and the solution is anticlimactic.  Although the Edinburgh setting is colorful, the book, as a whole, lacks the charm, warmth, and psychological depth that made \\"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" so delightful and satisfying.	2004-10-03

In her debut thriller, \\"The Dead,\\" Ingrid Black introduces a female character named Saxon, who is a former FBI agent from Boston and the author of a successful book about the hunt for a serial killer.  She is an expatriate living in Dublin, and her girlfriend is Detective Chief Superintendent Grace Fitzgerald.  Saxon is unapologetically gay and smokes Cuban cigars.  She is tough, hard-nosed, sarcastic, and always ready for a fight.<br /><br />A serial killer is loose in Dublin and he appears to be copying the methods of Ed Fagan, who was the prime suspect in the murder of five Dublin prostitutes.  Fagan managed to escape prosecution and he subsequently disappeared.  Five years later, a reporter named Nick Elliott has received a letter whose author claims to be Fagan.  The letter writer announces that he intends to start killing again.  Grace Fitzgerald enlists Saxon's help, as the bodies of murdered women start turning up.  Accompanying the corpses are strange notes with biblical references and symbols that provide cryptic clues to the killer's identity.<br /><br />\\"The Dead\\" is a well-written police procedural.  The Dublin setting is beautifully rendered, and Saxon's first person narrative is sharp, effective, and dryly humorous.  Black includes an ample number of red herrings to keep the reader off balance, and the information she provides on criminal profiling, forensics, and cryptology add texture to the book. The characters are varied and, for the most part, nicely drawn.  Exceptions are the sleazy journalist, Nick Elliott, and the obtuse and interfering Assistant Commissioner, Brian Draker, who are one-dimensional stereotypes.<br /><br />The biggest weakness is the convoluted, improbable, and drawn-out ending, in which Saxon commits an error so amateurish that she should be sent back to Criminology 101 for a refresher course.  Overall, however, \\"The Dead\\" is an engrossing novel by a talented and promising new author.	2004-10-03

Ann and Lucy met in Sarah Lawrence College in the eighties, although they did not become friends until they were both twenty-one and enrolled in the Iowa Writers' Workshop.  Lucy Grealy suffered from cancer as a child, and years of chemotherapy destroyed her jaw.  She eventually had thirty-eight unsuccessful reconstructive surgeries.  Not only was her face irrevocably damaged, but the rest of her body was also scarred as a result of skin, bone, and muscle grafts.<br /><br />Lucy was a talented and sensitive woman who was handicapped, not only by her devastating and debilitating physical illness, but also by the loss of her beloved father when she was just fourteen.  As a result, she felt lonely and isolated, and she constantly sought perfect and unconditional love.  She found at least some of that love in her friendship with Ann Patchett.<br /><br />Ann and Lucy were soul mates.  They helped one another sharpen their writing skills, and more importantly, they shared their hopes, fears, and disappointments.  Lucy was a grown-up child in many ways.  She constantly looked for approval, sometimes in the wrong places.  She was flighty, impulsive, and profligate with money.  Eventually, she turned to drugs to ease her physical and psychological pain.

John Rain is the Japanese-American action hero of \\"Rain Storm,\\" Barry Eisler's third installment in his series about a deadly killer for hire.  This time around, the CIA has hired Rain to take out an arms dealer named Belghazi, who is supplying munitions to fundamentalist terrorists groups.  If Rain wants to be paid, however, he must make the hit appear \\"natural\\" to the outside world.  Since Belghazi is a suspicious man and a martial arts expert who is heavily guarded, Rain has his work cut out for him.<br /><br />\\"Rain Storm\\" is everything a spy novel should be.  It takes place in exotic locales, such as Macau, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Brazil, and, using vivid descriptive writing, Eisler takes the time to describe each place in detail.  Rain is a terrific protagonist.  He is strong, cunning, schooled in exotic martial arts, and he trusts no one.  Wherever he goes, Rain watches his back, and he has many weapons in his arsenal to deflect attacks from potential assailants.  Rain, like so many other killers for hire, is at heart an isolated man who cannot sustain a relationship for long.  He has to keep moving to protect himself from his enemies, and he is tormented by the many killings that he has committed over the years.<br /><br />What would an action novel be without beautiful women?  There are several in this book, and one is a mysterious operative with impressive credentials, both in and out of the bedroom.  There is also a dizzying plot, with twists and turns galore, complicated political machinations, and exciting fight sequences.  It's fun to observe Rain conducting surveillance, tracking his prey, or adopting a clever disguise at the drop of a hat.  John Rain is a tough man with a sharp mind, who practices his craft with uncommon skill.  His exploits make \\"Rain Storm\\" a very entertaining and absorbing novel.	2004-09-27

Tim Russert's delightful memoir, \\"Big Russ and Me,\\" is a heartwarming and deeply felt tribute to his father, who instilled in his four children the values that ultimately shaped their adult lives. It is also a book about other influential people who had an impact on Tim Russert, both the boy and the man.<br /><br />Big Russ, as Tim calls his dad, fought in World War II, although he rarely talked about his days in the army. When he came home from the war, he raised his family in an Irish Catholic neighborhood in South Buffalo. Everyone knew one another and looked out for one another. Kids played on the street without fear, and front doors were left unlocked. Priests and teachers were figures of respect and reverence, and children were taught to look up to their elders.<br /><br />Big Russ worked two jobs, one with the sanitation department and the other as a delivery truck driver for the Buffalo Evening News. He took pride in providing for his family and he taught his children the value of a dollar. The Russert children learned the importance of honesty, self-discipline, and faith.<br /><br />With his humorous and anecdotal style, Tim Russert beautifully captures the wonderful memories of his youth, nostalgically looking back at the television programs he watched, the odd jobs he held, and the schools he attended. He gives special mention to a teacher named Sister Lucille, who taught Tim to love and appreciate English literature. She also gave Tim his first important job in journalism when he was in the seventh grade.<br /><br />After college, Russert went to law school and he began a love affair with politics. He describes his association with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Mario Cuomo, two statesmen whom he both admired and respected, and he traces his rewarding career as a broadcast journalist.<br /><br />\\"Big Russ and Me\\" is a book that will bring pleasure to readers of all ages.

Keith McCarthy's medical thriller, \\"The Silent Sleep of the Dying,\\" deals with a deadly virus that is created in a secret lab in a remote area of Scotland.  An accidental fire destroys the lab, and the scientists who collaborated on the project go their separate ways.  Two years later, one of these scientists, Millicent Sweet, suddenly becomes violently ill and dies an excruciating death.<br /><br />This dramatic beginning sets the stage for a complex tale of greed, blackmail, and murder.  Millicent Sweet's father, Raymond, asks a lawyer named Helena Flemming to look into his daughter's death.  Helena enlists the aid of an old friend, John Eisenmenger, a former forensic pathologist, to help her with her inquiries.  In addition, Inspector Beverley Wharton, an aggressive and ambitious woman who is persona non grata with her superiors, investigates the case without her boss's permission or knowledge.<br /><br />McCarthy ratchets up the tension nicely as Helena and John make some startling discoveries, most notably that a pharmaceutical company called Pel-Ebstein may have played a crucial role in the events leading to Sweet's death.  There is also a particularly nasty villain who pops up throughout the book, destroying anyone who gets in his way.<br /><br />For all of its merits, \\"The Silent Sleep of the Dying\\" does have a few weaknesses.  First, McCarthy assumes that his readers already know the history of Helena and John, both of whom are emotionally wounded individuals.  A little more background would have fleshed them out more satisfactorily.  In addition, the ending is a bit unrealistic and melodramatic.<br /><br />Still, the book has a great deal to recommend it, including some fascinating characters who are struggling not only with the important people in their lives, but also with the internal demons that plague them.  McCarthy delivers plenty of thrills, and readers who love medical suspense will find \\"The Silent Sleep of the Dying\\" action-packed and exciting.and exciting.	2004-09-19

Jack Germond has been a reporter for fifty years, and in that time, he has seen it all.  \\"Fat Man Fed Up\\" is a scathing indictment of the process that has made the American electoral system a shallow and hypocritical exercise.  Germond points his finger at an indifferent electorate, the media, and at politicians themselves, who, in his opinion, all share some of the blame for the decline of American politics.<br /><br />Germond quotes a publisher named Gray who flatly states that \\"we get about what we deserve\\" in terms of our elected officials at all levels of government.  Many voters are poorly informed about issues, and they are impatient with politicians who discuss the economy or foreign policy in detail.  Such voters look for attractive and likeable candidates, and they often reject more qualified individuals who are less charismatic.  Almost half of all Americans do not bother to vote at all.  How then can we complain when so many mediocre individuals are elected to represent us?<br /><br />Germond skewers the print and broadcast media, who pounce on every peccadillo and scandal in a politician's background, but who fail to balance things by giving thoughtful coverage to the important issues of the day.  Small wonder that so many voters throw up their hands in despair when they consider their options.  After all, they think, aren't all politicians lying crooks?  If we believe what we read in the papers and see on television, we might think that there are no honest elected officials working hard day after day to make our country a better place.<br /><br />In addition, Germond decries the state of campaigning in this country.  We live in an age when sound bites and the political attack ad rule the airwaves, and candidates' handlers heavily guard them lest they make a political gaffe that will end their chances. The result is that the voters have little or no opportunity to get to know the candidates, and many voters end up casting their ballots for an image rather than for a person.  Germond also reserves plenty of invective for meaningless political conventions, right-wing talk shows, misleading polls, and politicians who misrepresent themselves and spend tremendous amounts of money to buy an electoral victory.<br /><br />Some readers will be turned off by Germond's brutal honesty and salty language.  He makes no effort to sugarcoat his criticism of politicians who have failed to distinguish themselves as candidates or as elected officials.  Nor does he hold back in his harsh appraisal of the media and the public.  However, whether you agree with him or not, Germond's comments are timely, literate, and informative.<br /><br />Germond fails to wrap things up with a chapter listing facile solutions that will get American politics back on track quickly.  In fact, he doubts that any easy solutions exist.  However, the first step to addressing a problem is to admit that it exists.  If enough people read Germond's book, it is possible that we will start to think about ways to bring American politics back to life.e rather than for a person.

The book's heroine, pediatrician Sara Linton, visits the Grant County, Georgia, police station to see her ex-husband, police chief Jeffrey Tolliver.  Although they are divorced, Sara still carries a torch for Jeffrey.  Suddenly, two young military-types shoot up the police station and a hostage crisis ensues.  Through a series of flashbacks, the reader learns how Jeffrey's tortured history led to the present crisis.<br /><br />In 1991, Jeffrey took Sara to his hometown of Sylacauga, Alabama.  Sara discovers that Jeffrey's mother has been a drunk for years and that his father is in jail.  He also has a history of romancing every eligible girl within his reach.  Sara meets Jeffrey's friends, Robert and Possum, and she finds out that there are many dark secrets in this small town.<br /><br />\\"Indelible\\" has so much going on that you need a scorecard to keep track of the characters and their problems.  Among the plot elements are murder, alcoholism, infidelity, child abuse, the aforementioned hostage crisis, out-of-wedlock children, and homosexuality.  There is too much happening, both in the past and in the present, and the story gets more complicated as the book proceeds.  There are also many secondary characters in the book, such as Lena Adams, a police officer who is returning to the force after being ousted for reasons that are hinted at but never spelled out.  She is having trouble coming to terms with her past and she has frequent quarrels with her much younger boyfriend.  Lena is awkwardly shoehorned into the book, which has enough going on without her.<br /><br />Although I liked and cared about the characters of Jeffrey and Sara, I felt overwhelmed by the startling revelations that kept coming one after the other in this novel.  As I have said many times, too much clutter can spoil the thriller.  If Slaughter had pared down her convoluted and melodramatic plot to a manageable level, \\"Indelible\\" might have been more impressive.	2004-09-05

Dani Shapiro's novel, \\"Family History\\" is a painful look at the disintegration of a once close-knit family.  Ned and Rachel Jensen are a happily married couple who live in a suburb not far from Boston. Ned, who had once hoped to be a working artist, is a popular high school teacher and Rachel is a devoted mother and part-time art restorer.  Their daughter, Kate, is bright, athletic, and beautiful.<br /><br />Everything changes when Kate turns thirteen and comes home from camp with a sullen, distant, and rebellious attitude.  She begins to show signs of emotional disturbance, and as time goes on, her condition deteriorates.  After Rachel learns that she is pregnant, she desperately hopes that their lives will once again be happy and serene.  Her hopes are dashed when tragedy strikes and threatens to rip the Jensens apart forever.<br /><br />Dani Shapiro has an intimate writing style that draws the reader into these troubled lives.  We feel Rachel's panic as she sees all that she values slipping away from her.  Ned is a caring husband and father who has given up his dream to be an artist in order to support the wife and child he adores.  He is shocked when he realizes that his sacrifices may all have been in vain. Kate is a lost soul whose sensitivity and hurt overwhelm her and warp her judgment.  There are some nicely depicted supporting players in this novel, as well, most notably Rachel's mother, a self-absorbed harridan named Phyllis who is hypercritical and cold towards Rachel.<br /><br />What keeps \\"Family History\\" from being just another overwrought soap opera?  Shapiro fleshes out her characters thoroughly and she injects elements of hope and compassion into her story that keep the book from sinking under the weight of unrelieved gloom.  She poignantly shows that when two people truly love one another, they never stop trying to fix what seems to have been irrevocably broken.  \\"Family History\\" teeters on the edge of melodrama, but it is saved by Shapiro's moving and compassionate depiction of a family ravaged by life.moving and compassionate depiction of a family ravaged by life.	2004-09-05

In the typical anti-HMO novel, the villains are avaricious and homicidal executives of managed care health organizations. These baddies make big bucks while they cut services to the patients who depend on them. The latest entry in this popular genre is \\"The Society,\\" by Michael Palmer.<br /><br />Our hero is Bostonian Will Grant, a young, dedicated, and talented surgeon whose skill with a scalpel is matched by his compassion for those in need. Will works long hours, and even devotes time to feeding the homeless at the Open Hearth Kitchen, which he helped found. Dr. Grant is divorced, but he is passionately devoted to his two children, Danny and Jess, with whom he spends as much quality time as he can spare. If this isn't enough to qualify him for sainthood, Will is also a member of the Hippocrates Society, whose goal is to fight the managed care industry. Will reluctantly becomes the spokesman for the society when he is picked to debate Boyd Halliday, the CEO of Excelsius Health, at a public forum. Halliday and Grant square off in Faneuil Hall, and their heated discussion about the pros and cons of HMOs attracts a great deal of attention from the public and the media.<br /><br />Will regrets his decision to adopt a high profile when an unknown enemy, intent on destroying his career and his reputation, frames him. To make matters worse, Will is the number one suspect when a series of HMO bigwigs are murdered in cold blood. Will has few allies, but the one he values most is Patty Moriarty, a beautiful, tough, and spunky Detective Sergeant with the Massachusetts State Police. Patty is fighting battles of her own against sexist cops who want to drive her out of the police force.<br /><br />\\"The Society\\" suffers from underdeveloped characters, a muddled and unrealistic plot, absurd theatrics, and a laughable ending. As is usual in these types of novels, Will unnecessarily walks into dangerous situations with no protection and no back-up, and surprise, he gets into really hot water. The villains are way over the top, and the author writes the second half of the book as if he is on autopilot. It is distressing that Michael Palmer, a writer who has turned in some good work in the past, has produced a novel with a worthwhile message but very little else to recommend it.tection and no back-up, and surprise, he gets into really hot water.

She soon learns that Jack is far from the man of her dreams. He drinks too much, and he lashes out in violent rages with no warning.  Since she is a devout Catholic, Valerie believes that a wife must remain with her husband for life and do her best to keep him happy.  Valerie struggles to keep her problems \\"Behind Closed Doors\\" in Susan Sloan's dark novel of domestic dysfunction.<br /><br />After Valerie becomes pregnant, it begins to dawn on her that Jack's behavior will adversely affect their children.  However, she remains with Jack and her decision to stand by her man has devastating consequences for both her and her family.  Sloan follows Valerie and Jack through over forty years of marriage and the journey is one of almost unremitting tragedy.<br /><br />\\"Behind Closed Doors\\" is a heavy-handed novel about the causes and consequences of domestic violence.  Everything here is very familiar.  We learn about Jack's miserable childhood with a bullying father and a series of abused \\"mothers\\" who pass briefly through his life.  This history supposedly explains why Jack grows into an immature and bitter man who uses alcohol to anesthetize himself.  However, Sloan's portrayal never makes Jack seem real.  He is the stereotypical wife beater whom we have seen so often in similar books.  Valerie is a passive individual who lets life happen to her and waits a very long time to fight back.<br /><br />Sloan's plotting is melodramatic, with drug dealing, prostitution, armed robbery, and murder figuring in this long and drawn-out novel.  Sloan tells us nothing new about domestic violence, nor do any of her characters come to life. This book is exhausting to read, and one wonders how so much misfortune can befall the unbelievably miserable Marsh family.  \\"Behind Closed Doors\\" may very well be one of the most depressing novels of the year.e most depressing novels of the year.	2004-08-29

The victim, whose name is Anna, looks exactly like Maura, but Maura is not aware of ever having been a twin.  Who is the dead woman and why was she killed?  On the case is the very pregnant Detective Jane Rizzoli.  Also offering assistance is handsome Detective Rick Ballard, who had been in love with Anna.  He and Maura quickly begin to form an emotional attachment.  As Rizzoli digs further into Anna's past, she makes some shocking discoveries about Anna's parentage that may shed light on the investigation.  The plot thickens even more when new evidence points to the possiblity that a serial killer is on the loose.<br /><br />Although Tess Gerritsen is a competent writer, \\"Body Double\\" is not her best work.  Maura and Jane are sympathetic and spunky heroines, but the plot is unfocused, rambling, convoluted, and wildly improbable.  The villains are ciphers and remain so until the end.  There is lots of gore, as one expects from Gerritsen, plus a few surprises, but there is no emotional payoff after all of the novel's mayhem runs its course.

It turns out that there is an extremely sick man on the loose in the quiet town of Wallingford, Connecticut. This individual has been killing people for a most unusual reason. Will Maggie catch the killer before he strikes again?<br /><br />If all this sounds routine, it is, but Kava's nicely depicted characters place this book a notch above the ordinary. There is Luc Racine, a retired postal worker who may have seen the killer. Sadly, Luc is afflicted with Alzheimer's, and his memory is unreliable. Dr. Adam Bonzado is a young and good-looking forensic anthropologist who has been called in to analyze the victims' bones, and when he starts working with Maggie, he finds himself attracted to her.  Sheriff Henry Watermeier is close to retirement age.  He would prefer not to get bogged down in such a difficult case when he should be taking it easy. Meanwhile, Maggie has some painful emotional baggage that troubles her, but she is determined not to let the past ruin her future.<br /><br />\\"At the Stroke of Madness\\" moves along very quickly, and I finished it in less than a day.

Don Jaime lives in Spain and makes a modest living teaching fencing to young men of means.  He also meets regularly with a rakish aristocrat, Luis de Ayala, a wealthy womanizer and gambler who enjoys parrying with words as well as swords. The fifty-six year old Don Jaime has been working for years on what he hopes will be the ultimate treatise on fencing, one that will surpass all others that preceded it.<br /><br />This is a time of political upheaval in Spain.  Queen Isabel II is on the throne, but those who vehemently oppose the monarchy are threatening to force her into exile.  Although Don Jaime is oblivious to current events, he frequents a cafe where his acquaintances argue about politics for hours at a time.  The fencing master is prepared to live the rest of his life following his predictable routine, when a beautiful young woman named Adela de Otero summons him to her home.  Although she is already an accomplished fencer, Adela implores Don Jaime to become her teacher.  Against his better judgment, he takes her on as his pupil, and he soon falls under her spell.<br /><br />\\"The Fencing Master\\" is a marvel of elegant writing, and the character of Don Jaime is mesmerizing.  He is an anachronism, a man who was born too late.  He dresses in clothes that went out of style two decades ago, and he stubbornly holds on to his memories and to his old-fashioned code of honor.  He also fences in a classical style that few people value anymore.  In addition, Don Jaime is naive in the ways of the world, and he is quite unprepared for the sudden intrigue and danger that disrupt his peaceful existence.  However, when the fencing master holds a foil in his hand, the years disappear, and Don Jaime becomes a formidable combatant who is the equal of any other fencer on earth.<br /><br />All of the characters in this novel are intriguing, from the bewitching and mysterious Adela to the dissipated Luis de Ayala, and Perez-Reverte captures the tension of a country whose government is under siege.

The rage of frustrated black people in Los Angeles has erupted into an orgy of looting and violence that has left the entire city in a state of frightened vigilance. The police ask Easy to look into the death of Nola Payne, nicknamed Little Scarlet. She is black woman who may have been killed by a white man. Police Commissioner Gerald Jordan wants the investigation to be conducted with tact and subtlety in order to prevent a flare-up of the rioting.<br /><br /> Easy takes the case and he begins to make discreet inquiries into the circumstances surrounding Nola Payne's death. He places himself in danger from the woman's killer, from some members of the police department who do not want a black man treading on their turf, and from some neighborhood folks who think he should just butt out of matters that do not concern him.<br /><br /> \\"Little Scarlet\\" is a mood piece more than a mystery. Mosley captures the speech cadences, the gritty vernacular, the jittery atmosphere, and the despair in Los Angeles during that horrible summer. Yet Mosley keeps the proceedings light with his wry sense of humor, and he also fills the book with colorful characters, such as Raymond \\"Mouse\\" Alexander. Mouse is a man who dresses like a clown, has a reputation as a stone cold killer, but whose help is invaluable when Easy needs information and backup.<br /><br /> Easy Rawlins is the centerpiece of \\"Little Scarlet,\\" and he is charismatic, charming, compassionate, and real. Easy loves his girlfriend, Bonnie, but he admits that other beautiful women catch his eye all the time. Although he could give in to the temptations that other men are prey to, Easy usually thinks things through and makes a decision based on what his gut tells him is right or wrong.<br /><br /> Mosley's descriptive writing is magnificent. He brings every scene to life with figurative language that is both precise and imaginative. He also brilliantly explores the evils of racism and the poisonous effects of self-hatred.

Grace Callahan is a thirty-two-old single mother with a great deal on her mind in &quot;Hide Yourself Away,&quot; by Mary Jane Clark. Grace is having trouble making ends meet, since her nasty ex-husband, Frank, has been withholding child support payments. Grace wants to work as a broadcast journalist, and she takes an internship with KEY news that may give her an opportunity to break into the business. Unfortunately, Grace's professional responsibilities take her away from home for many hours at a time, and she feels guilty for neglecting her daughter, Lucy.<br /><br /> The KEY news crew goes on location for a week in Newport, Rhode Island. Grace is competing with other interns for a shot at a full-time job that she desperately wants. Suddenly, the discovery of a skeleton in a tunnel beneath an old mansion shocks the community and brings back unpleasant memories. The body is identified as Charlotte Sloane, a wealthy socialite who mysteriously disappeared fourteen years earlier and was never seen again. After Charlotte's death is ruled a homicide, the townspeople speculate about the identity of the person who killed Charlotte and dumped her in the tunnel.<br /><br /> Grace and the other members of KEY news all get involved in the investigation. They interview long-time residents of Newport who knew Charlotte, seeking that one bit of information that will break open the case. As more and more clues emerge, the murderer strikes again. It seems that whoever killed Charlotte is still at large, and he or she will do anything to elude detection.<br /><br /> &quot;Hide Yourself Away&quot; has a contrived and formulaic plot with one-dimensional characters, stilted dialogue, and enough red herrings to populate three mystery novels. Clark presents quite a few characters with motives for murder, but she does not take the time to develop her characters or to explore any meaningful themes. On the plus side, there is a pleasant romance to please female readers, and some nice local color regarding the history of Newport, Rhode Island. On the whole, &quot;Hide Yourself Away&quot; is a run-of-the-mill thriller, interchangeable with dozens of similar suspense novels that are churned out each year.history of Newport, Rhode Island.

The criminal mastermind known as the Deaf Man is back in &quot;Hark!,&quot; Ed McBain's latest 87th Precinct novel. When last seen, the Deaf Man, who calls himself Adam Fen (an anagram for &quot;Deaf Man&quot;), had been shot by his double-crossing girlfriend and left for dead. He didn't die, and after paying a visit to the girlfriend, he is now tormenting his old adversaries at the 87th with an endless series of notes. Most of the missives are excerpts from the works of Shakespeare, and the cops are scratching their heads in confusion.<br /><br /> In fact, the cops know as much about Shakespeare as they do about nuclear physics. When they get the Deaf Man's messages, they are baffled, since Shakespeare is, well, Greek to them. What caper is the Deaf Man planning, and why is he sending the cops incomprehensible notes filled with anagrams, palindromes, and flowery Elizabethan language?<br /><br /> McBain reintroduces our favorite characters, including Carella, Kling, Fat Ollie, and Cotton Hawes. All of these guys have personal and, in some cases, romantic problems that complicate their lives considerably. Can Carella make his peace with his mother's and sister's impending nuptials? Will Hawes be able sustain a meaningful relationship with Honey Blair, who is an ambitious media celebrity? And why is Kling's attractive girlfriend seeing an old flame on the sly?<br /><br /> Although &quot;Hark!&quot; is entertaining, it lacks the depth and bite of McBain's best work. The Deaf Man is a literate, but not particularly compelling, villain, and McBain flits quickly from one thin plotline to another. Still, at its best, &quot;Hark!&quot; is an amusing lark with a few genuinely funny bits, and McBain effectively depicts both cops and criminals as flawed, foolish, self-destructive, comic, and vulnerable individuals. If the Bard were a fan of crime fiction, he would undoubtedly applaud this talented and amusing writer.	2004-08-01

Marsha Avery is the mother of three children, Nina, Patrick, and James, and the wife of Duncan, a respected physician. When Marsha is brutally murdered by an unknown assailant, Duncan is convicted and sent to prison. Although he has professed his innocence throughout the years, Nina is the only one who believes him.<br /><br /> Years pass, and when Duncan becomes eligible for parole, he is a broken man. He has been stripped of his medical license, and he lacks the friendships, money, and prestige that he once took for granted. His two sons are reluctant to associate with him. Only Nina has remained loyal and steadfast throughout the many years that her father has been in prison. Nina is horrified when her father tells her that he wants to return to the New Jersey suburb where her mother was killed. He insists that he needs to find out who really killed Marsha Avery. Duncan's fateful decision leads to unexpected and chilling consequences.<br /><br /> &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; is a suspenseful psychological thriller that is hard to put down. The characters are nicely depicted, especially Nina Avery, the dutiful daughter who supports her father when everyone else has abandoned him. The plot is engrossing, with violence, romance, and enough surprising twists and turns to keep even the most clever reader guessing until the surprising, albeit melodramatic, conclusion. If you like intricate page-turners, pick up this fast-moving and exciting novel.	2004-08-01

Mary DiNunzio, the widowed lawyer with smothering but loving Italian parents, takes center stage in \\"Killer Smile,\\" the latest novel by Lisa Scottoline. Mary is obsessed with a pro bono case that she is pursuing on behalf of the estate of the late Amadeo Brandolini. Brandolini was interned in Montana during World War II along with other Italian-Americans, and he apparently died by his own hand in 1942. Mary has been retained to sue the federal government for reparations on behalf of Amadeo's estate. Since there is very little documentation left after so many years, Mary is having a hard time putting together her case.<br /><br /> As Mary digs further into Amadeo's background, even making a trip to Montana where he had been interned, she finds some puzzling clues that raise a number of intriguing questions. Did Amadeo really kill himself or was he murdered? If he was murdered, who killed him and why? Mary refuses to drop the case even after she is threatened and her office is ransacked. Mary's tenacious pursuit of the facts surrounding Amadeo's death soon places her career and her life in jeopardy.<br /><br /> \\"Killer Smile\\"  is paint-by-numbers Lisa Scottoline. She once again mines the Italian-American background of Mary DiNunzio for comic relief and poignancy. Mary's parents, Mariano and Vita, as well as her South Philadelphia neighbors, are all incredibly protective of her. Mary's relatives, neighbors, and colleagues are constantly setting her up on blind dates, but since her husband, Mike, was killed, Mary has been unable to fall in love with another man.<br /><br /> The mystery of Amadeo's death is mildly engrossing, but not enough to offset a long and tedious narrative that leads to a melodramatic, pat, and predictable ending. The villains are thuggish, the good guys are sugary sweet, and the humor, which in previous novels was often delightful, is forced this time around. Mary is a bland character who cannot carry a whole novel on her frail shoulders.<br /><br /> I found the subplot about the federal government's unfair detention of Italian-Americans during World War II compelling, especially since I knew more about the internment of the Japanese-Americans than about the victimization of other ethnic groups. Although \\"Killer Smile\\" provides a good history lesson about a shameful chapter in our country's history, it is a tepid and only mildly entertaining legal thriller.<br />  <br /> I found the subplot about the federal government's unfair detention of Italian-Americans during World War II compelling, especially since I knew more about the internment of the Japanese-Americans than about the victimization of other ethnic groups.

In Jeff Lindsay's &quot;Darkly Dreaming Dexter,&quot; the antihero is Dexter Morgan, a lovable serial killer. Dexter suffered through a traumatic childhood event, and it left him with an insatiable desire to kill people. Instead of visiting a psychiatrist or joining a support group, Dexter pursues his hobby and finds interesting ways to satisfy his blood lust. Ironically, Dexter's day job is blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department.<br /><br /> It's hard not to like Dexter. He's good-looking, unfailingly polite, and attentive to his sister, Deb, a cop. Since Dexter has terrific insight into the minds of serial killers, he helps his sister by feeding her his opinions on an investigation into a series of brutal killings and dismemberments of female prostitutes in Miami. Deb hopes that this information will help her crack the case and get a promotion to the Homicide Bureau. As this other serial killer continues on his murderous rampage, it becomes increasingly clear that Dexter's understanding of the case and his empathy with the killer is too thorough. He begins to suspect that there is a strong and frightening connection between him and the murderer.<br /><br /> Dexter is a fascinating and original character, a serial killer with a self-deprecating sense of humor and no illusions about himself. He knows that he is not like everyone else, and he tries to make the best of it. In several hilarious scenes, women hit on Dexter, and he is so devoid of real emotion and human understanding, that he has no idea how to respond.<br /><br /> Lindsay covers some old territory, too, in which he explores departmental politics and bureaucratic ineptitude in the police department. The dialogue is clever and witty and the story is fast-paced, albeit completely unrealistic, but the book succeeds mostly because Dexter is so entertaining. Is it tasteful to feature a hero who kills regularly because his inner demons compel him to do so? Probably not, but &quot;Darkly Dreaming Dexter&quot; is funny, deliciously creepy, and a real page-turner.ny, deliciously creepy, and a real page-turner.	2004-07-25

In Sue Grafton's latest Kinsey Millhone caper, &quot;R is for Ricochet,&quot; romance is in the air. Kinsey finally has a love interest, a hunky cop named Cheney. Henry, Kinsey's octogenarian landlord, is seeing an attractive and vivacious woman whom he met on a cruise.<br /><br /> Meanwhile, a wealthy old man named Nord Lafferty has hired Kinsey to keep tabs on the daughter he adores but cannot control. Her name is Reba Lafferty, and she is just getting out of prison after serving time for embezzlement. Reba is a loose cannon who has an affinity for drinking and gambling, and she has a very close relationship with her married former employer, Alan Beckwith. He is a shady businessman who is up to his ears in questionable financial dealings. Kinsey's job is to keep Reba on the straight and narrow, but this proves to be a very tall order indeed.<br /><br /> The &quot;ricochet&quot; in the title may refer to the &quot;spy vs. spy&quot; aspects of the plot. Most of the characters are not sure where they stand with one another, and there is a lot of second-guessing and psychological game playing going on. Kinsey is caught between her loyalty and concern for Reba and her desire to help Cheney and his colleagues collar Beckwith for his misdeeds. Unfortunately for Kinsey, the fearless Reba has a mind of her own, and she is determined to do exactly as she pleases.<br /><br /> &quot;R is for Ricochet&quot; is brisk and fast-moving, and it features Grafton's trademark dry humor and crisp dialogue. However, Kinsey does very little sleuthing this book. She is more a pawn for others than a proactive individual, and she gets herself into scrapes that could easily have been foreseen and prevented. The characters are a bit flat, and the novel lacks the bite and depth of Grafton's earlier works. However, if you want a passably entertaining, light summer read, &quot;R is for Ricochet&quot; will do just fine.	2004-07-22

In &quot;Murder Plays House,&quot; by Ayelet Waldman, lawyer and part-time sleuth Juliet Applebaum is bursting at the seams.  Literally.  She has gained fifty pounds during her third pregnancy and she and her husband, Peter, need a bigger house for their growing family.  The problem is that a desirable house in L. A. is not easy to get unless the buyers are filthy rich, which Juliet and her husband most certainly are not.<br />While house hunting with her realtor friend one day, Juliet stumbles upon a dead body in the bathtub.  The owner of the house, who is the victim's brother, retains Juliet to help investigate the case.  Along with her partner, Al, Juliet starts digging into the life of the deceased, an out-of-work actress named Alicia Felix.<br />Juliet interviews Alicia's former co-workers, ex-boyfriend, and anyone else with a possible connection to the crime.  At the same time, the mother-to-be is trying to cope with her out-of-control appetite and ungainly shape, while also tending to the needs of her husband and young children.<br />&quot;Murder Plays House&quot; has its moments.  Juliet is witty and sassy, and Waldman's wry humor and satirical treatment of the shallow L. A. culture are right on target.  The author has a go at the trendy fashions, the insane desire to be thin at all costs, and the desperation of marginally talented actors to make it in show biz.<br />Waldman has trouble, however, balancing her lighthearted humor with the book's tragic elements, most of which are introduced in the second half of the novel.  The carefree tone of the book's opening gives way to a somewhat somber and preachy ending.  Although the plots of the &quot;Mommy-Track Mysteries&quot; are only passable, I keep reading them because of my fondness for Waldman's irresistible and down-to-earth heroine, Juliet Applebaum.	2004-07-19

Buffa's latest legal thriller, &quot;Breach of Trust,&quot; criminal defense attorney Joseph Antonelli takes the case of Jimmy Haviland, an old friend from law school.  Back in Harvard, Joseph had a tight circle of acquaintances, including Jimmy, Thomas Browning, now Vice President of the United States, and the beautiful Annie Malreaux.  Both Thomas Browning and Jimmy Haviland were in love with Annie, but tragically, she either fell or was pushed to her death at the Plaza Hotel on Christmas Eve in 1965.  Now, many years after the event, Jimmy Haviland is being tried for Annie's murder.<br />Thomas Browning has enlisted Joseph Antonelli, one of the country's most eminent and successful attorneys, to take Jimmy's case.  Browning is convinced that Jimmy is being railroaded by the Vice President's political enemies.  These individuals, Browning believes, want the public to think that years ago, Browning saw Jimmy pushing Annie to her death. According to this scenario, the Vice-President of the United States was once involved in the cover-up of a murder.<br />Buffa's exploration of the ruthless and polarizing world of politics is both timely and relevant.  He ably shows how our justice system can be undermined to suit the needs of ambitious and self-serving individuals.  These themes resonate in today's cutthroat political climate.<br />&quot;Breach of Trust&quot; is not just about politics.  Buffa effectively shows the contrast between the idealism of youth and the disillusionment of middle age. When he was young, Antonelli looked forward to a fulfilling career.  Years later, although he is well off and has achieved professional success and recognition, Antonelli is lonely and his personal life is barren.  Antonelli fears that he will grow old alone, and he embarks on an affair with Gisela, a reporter with ambitions of her own.  It turns out that most people in &quot;Breach of Trust&quot; have hidden agendas, and the characters generally operate at cross-purposes.<br />The book's main weakness is Buffa's writing style, which is uneven.  Too often, he pads his sentences with overwrought prose, rambling descriptions, and too much repetition.  However, the engrossing characters and the thought-provoking plot make &quot;Breach of Trust&quot; worth reading, and I was pleasantly surprised by the bittersweet and poignant ending.poses.<br />The book's main weakness is Buffa's writing style, which is uneven.

Unfortunately, a series of unexplained suicides among some of Eden's most well-matched pairs, known as &quot;supercouples,&quot; has begun to worry the company's executives.  They bring in Christopher Lash, a forensic psychologist who once worked with the FBI, to find out why and how these men and women died.  Were these deaths just bizarre coincidences or is something more sinister going on?<br />&quot;Death Match&quot; is an intriguing thriller that touches on some contemporary themes, such as computer matchmaking, the lack of privacy in the age of the Internet, and the synergy between our government and large corporations.  As Lash studies the deaths of these &quot;perfect&quot; couples, he learns that they were indeed happy in every way, with no psychological disorders that would predispose them to suicide.  As Lash digs deeper, he makes some horrifying discoveries, and in the process, he places both his reputation and his life in danger.<br />Child's writing is fast-paced and lively, and the author includes fascinating details about psychological testing and artificial intelligence.  He also explores the difficulty that modern men and women have in finding an appropriate mate, and why they turn to computer dating services to solve their problems.  Can a sophisticated computer come up with a foolproof way to bring the right people together, or is the attraction between individuals too indefinable to be captured by computer software?<br />There are aspects of this novel that are far-fetched, and many readers will guess where the book is heading way before the denouement. However, the plot still plays out with sufficient suspense and flair to make &quot;Death Match&quot; a timely and engrossing thriller.er.	2004-07-11

Arturo Perez-Reverte's mystery, &quot;The Flanders Panel,&quot; takes place in Madrid and was translated from the Spanish by Margaret Jull Costa. It deals with a mysterious work of art, &quot;The Game of Chess,&quot; that was painted by a Flemish artist, Pieter Van Huys, in 1471. Julia, an art expert who has been restoring this painting prior to its being auctioned off, suddenly unearths a message hidden in the painting. The message, &quot;Quis necavit equitem?&quot; is Latin for &quot;Who killed the knight?&quot; It prompts intense speculation as to why the painter first included this message in his painting and later painted over it.<br /><br /> It turns out that the game of chess depicted in the painting provides clues to the meaning of the message, which relates to matters of political intrigue in the fifteenth century. Suddenly, the intrigue reaches into the present when a noted art historian is found dead under mysterious circumstances. It soon becomes apparent that the murderer is an individual with a macabre sense of humor and a thorough knowledge of chess.<br /><br /> I was disappointed in &quot;The Flanders Panel.&quot; The characters, including Cesar, who is Julia's surrogate father, Menchu, Julia's best friend and the owner of an art gallery, and Senor Munoz, a chess expert, are all rather flat and uninteresting. The book is talky and plodding, the plot is too complicated, and the references to chess are incomprehensible to a non-player. The sole aspect of the book that interested me was the history of the painting and the meaning of the hidden message. It is unfortunate that the rest of the novel lacks enough plausibility, suspense, and excitement to make &quot;The Flanders Panel&quot; an entertaining mystery.	2004-07-11

Snow is measured by feet, not inches, and if you don't bundle up, you can freeze to death.  Alex McKnight, the loner ex-cop who had pretty much given up on love, has fallen for Natalie Reynaud, a cop from the Ontario Provincial Police.  One night, when Alex and Natalie visit the fancy Ojibway Hotel in Sault Ste. Marie, an elderly man tips his hat to them.  Little do they know that this man holds the key to Natalie's painful past, and both Natalie and Alex are about to be dragged back in time.<br />At its best, &quot;Ice Run&quot; is an atmospheric and brooding story, with terse dialogue and some delightfully quirky characters.  I especially like Jackie, who cares for Alex so much that he reams him for getting sucked into Natalie's problems, and Leon, Alex's old friend, who at a moment's notice, drops everything to do some important digging for his old pal.<br />The villains, alas, are stock characters, and the mystery itself is not particularly involving.  However, Hamilton has a way of capturing the loneliness and desolation of a Michigan winter and tying it in with the characters' bitter and icy emotions. Alex is a charismatic and compassionate hero, and it is hard not to cheer for a man who is willing to risk his life for the woman he loves.	2004-07-05

Paul Campos has courage.  In his new and radical book, \\"The Obesity Myth,\\" he cites scientific evidence contradicting the commonly accepted notion that obese people die sooner than thin people. Although he is a lawyer, not a scientist, Campos is well versed in this subject area.  He writes with expertise and passion about a controversial issue that is certain to fuel heated debate among scientists and laymen alike.<br /><br />If obesity is not the killer that doctors and the media make it out to be, then why do so many people obsess over their weight?  Campos cites many factors that have led to our becoming a culture gone mad over thinness.  He states that we have been brainwashed by the weight loss industry, the medical establishment, and Hollywood into believing that fat is terrible.  Not only do fat people look bad, but they also die young, we are told over and over again.  Weight loss is big business, and the more fat and unhappy we are, the more likely we are to fork over big bucks for the next hot diet book or weight loss program.  What many of us do not know is that a large number of the studies that demonize obesity are funded by the very same weight loss industry that profits from our desperation to lose weight.<br /><br />Campos brings sociology, feminism, and politics into the mix.  Many individuals in our society consider fat people to be sloppy, irresponsible, and undisciplined losers.  Since it is politically incorrect to dislike those whose skin color is different from ours, we have turned our disgust against obese people, who rarely fight back.  In fact, many obese people hate themselves, and become yo-yo dieters in a futile effort to reach their \\"ideal\\" weight.  Other women endanger their health by starving themselves and exercising constantly.  Campos also explores how otherwise successful women revert to pre-feminist thinking where their weight is concerned.  Even professional women who have a resume packed with accomplishments consider themselves failures if they cannot wear a size six.<br /><br />Does Campos champion eating whatever we want and ballooning to 400 pounds?  On the contrary, he claims that everyone should exercise and eat healthful foods.  You can be fit and fat. Since not everyone can or should be thin, he suggests that we are better off accepting ourselves than fighting to change our natural body types.  \\"The Obesity Myth\\" is an outspoken, literate, well-written, thought-provoking, and surprising look at a subject that is on everyone's mind these days.  You may not agree with the author's conclusions, but you will find that this book provides plenty of food for thought.y cannot wear a size six.

Temperance Brennan is on the job again in \\"Monday Mouring,\\" the latest forensic thriller by Kathy Reichs. Someone has found three sets of bones in the basement of a Montreal pizza parlor, and Tempe believes that the bones belonged to young women in their teens. How did these bones get in this cellar and how long have they been there? This case is a tough one that gives Tempe many sleepless nights.<br /><br />To add to her problems, Tempe's relationship with Andrew Ryan, the Canadian cop she has been dating, is strained, and she suspects that he may be seeing another woman. In addition, the stubborn and obstructive homicide detective Luc Claudel gives Tempe a headache whenever she tries to convince him to follow up a lead. The pizza parlor case progresses slowly, with few clues turning up to help the detectives in their investigation. Tempe realizes that she will have to use all of her scientific knowledge and experience to find out who killed these girls, and, she hopes, stop the killer from hurting other young women.<br /><br />Reichs does a workmanlike job of setting up what proves to be a fairly standard thriller plot. What makes Reichs special is her tremendous attention to detail. Since she herself is one of the world's foremost experts in forensic anthropology, Reichs uses her considerable expertise to add fascinating details about Carbon 14 dating of bones and other obscure techniques to bring an element of realism to the story. A subplot about Tempe's friend, Anne, who comes calling when her marriage goes sour, does not move the plot along very much.<br /><br />The major weakness of \\"Monday Mourning\\" is the formulaic ending, which is filled with damsel in distress cliches and a few obligatory twists and turns. However, Tempe is always terrific, and the fascinating forensic information alone makes the book worth reading.	2004-07-04

In his new novel, \\"The Madman's Tale,\\" John Katzenbach deviates from the thriller formula and succeeds brilliantly. The hero and narrator is Francis Petrel, a middle-aged ex-mental patient who is haunted by voices that constantly invade his thoughts. In flashback, Petrel relives the time twenty years ago when he was committed to Western State Hospital in Massachusetts after his family could no longer tolerate his erratic and threatening behavior. In the hospital, Petrel meets many other patients suffering from paranoia, delusions of grandeur, catatonia, and other mental disabilities. To add to his feelings of insecurity and imminent danger, Francis is enlisted to help trap a murderer, known as \\"the Angel,\\" who has killed someone inside the mental hospital and will likely kill again.<br /><br />Katzenbach masterfully recreates the ambiance of a mental hospital in the 1970's. We get to know the pompous director and his staff, most of whom use medications as weapons to keep the patients under control. We get to know Francis, known by the nickname C-Bird, a gentle soul who is terrified almost all of the time and who feels profoundly lonely and lost. The whole cast of mental patients comes poignantly to life. There is Cleo, an enormous woman who thinks of herself as the Queen of Egypt, Newsman, a patient who keeps everyone up to date on current events, and Peter, a former fireman who is more angry than insane. When a nurse is brutally murdered, Peter and C-Bird join together with Lucy Jones, a prosecuting attorney with inner terrors of her own, to trap a killer.<br /><br />If the novel were completely plot driven, it would have been a run-of-mill suspense thriller.  What elevates this book is that Katzenbach uses his journalist's powers of description to capture the deadening routine of the mental hospital, the prison-like surroundings, the patients' lack of dignity, and the harsh drugs that rob the mentally ill of their humanity without curing them. Katzenbach uses original and clever literary devices which play on the relationship between reality and illusion, and demonstrate vividly how individuals who suffer from psychiatric illnesses live in a daily hell that is every bit as bad or worse than anything the outside world can inflict upon them.<br /><br />In many suspense thrillers, authors cast emotionally disturbed individuals either as pathetic losers unworthy of our attention or as serial killers. In \\"The Madman's Tale,\\" the mentally ill are people, just like you are me, who are horribly mistreated by a society that fears them and wants them to disappear, never to be seen again. Katzenback portrays Francis as an intelligent person with intense feelings who is unlucky enough to suffer from a disabling disease.

In her first novel, \\"Morningside Heights,\\" Cheryl Mendelson focuses on the various crises that befall a group of friends and neighbors living on the West Side of Manhattan.  Charles and Anne Braithwaite's problems are mostly financial.  They spend more money than they take in on their three children's music lessons and tuition, gourmet foods, and maintenance charges on their cooperative apartment.  Charles is an opera singer who has never achieved stardom, and Anne has given up her career as a pianist to be a stay-at-home mom.<br /><br />Charles and Anne have a motley crew of friends, such as the neurotic Merrit, a beautiful and scholarly woman who undermines her chances at happiness by always falling for the wrong men.  She has always had a special enmity for a scientist friend of the Braithwaites named Morris, and Morris unexpectedly becomes a part of her life when he moves into the Braithwaite's building.<br /><br />\\"Morningside Heights\\" is a psychological and sociological look at a group of quirky, self-absorbed, well-educated, and sophisticated urbanites who have a tendency to overdramatize the events in their lives. Although the characters are lively enough, Mendelson's writing style is stilted and her dialogue does not ring true.  Mendelson also goes into each character's rambling inner thoughts in detail, and these passages are often more tedious than enlightening. There are some plot twists involving the estate of an elderly neighbor and Merrit's tortuous love life, but these surprises are not enough to save the book from its own pretentiousness.	2004-06-27

Bruce Edwards was passionate about golf, and he realized at a young age that the itinerant life of a caddy was ideal for him.  He worked mostly with one man, the great Tom Watson, who also became his lifelong friend.  If Edwards had not been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease when he was in his late forties, this book would not have been written.  However, in 2003, a doctor at the Mayo Clinic told Edwards that he had only a short time to live. &quot;Caddy for Life,&quot; by John Feinstein, is the poignant, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting story of this courageous man.<br />Feinstein writes knowledgeably not just about Bruce Edwards, but also about the game of golf.  When Edwards started out as a caddy, he worked for peanuts, and his living accommodations were spartan.  It was only in later years that Edwards and other caddies gleaned substantial financial rewards for their efforts. People like Edwards completely changed the nature of caddying.  Edwards studied each golf course thoroughly and took meticulous notes about every bump and ridge on each green. In many ways, a sharp and experienced caddy can raise a golfer's game to a higher level, and Edwards was one of the best caddies in the game.<br />&quot;Caddy for Life&quot; is, most of all, an emotional paean to the close friendship that developed between Tom Watson and Bruce Edwards.  Since they went through so much during their almost thirty years together on various golf courses, Watson and Edwards knew and loved each other like brothers.  Watson cried often in the days and months after Edwards told him the grim news about his fatal illness.  Since then, Watson has done his best to raise awareness as well as funds for research that may someday lead to a cure for this horrendous disease.<br />Edwards's illness devastated his loved ones, including his parents and three siblings.  What a cruel fate that a short time after Edwards proposed to the love of life, Marsha, he was diagnosed with ALS. However, he refused to shut himself in his room and brood about his misfortune.  Edwards spent the rest of his life caddying with Watson to the best of his ability, and fighting the disease that was robbing him of his speech and his strength.<br />&quot;Caddy for Life&quot; is not only about the sadness of a man cut down in his prime.  It is also an entertaining and often amusing account of how various golfers have struggled to tackle some of the most challenging courses in the world.  Feinstein illustrates time and again that golf is as much a mental as a physical game, and few golfers have the psychological makeup to handle the pressure.  &quot;Caddy for Life&quot; is an engrossing, moving, and informative look at the world of golf and at one particular individual who has left an indelible mark on the game he loved so much.efused to shut himself in his room and brood about his misfortune.

Christopher Whitcomb, a fifteen-year veteran of the FBI and a former member of the elite Hostage Rescue Team, has written an electrifying novel about the shadowy world of spies, snipers, intelligence gathering, and terrorism.  &quot;Black&quot; refers to the world of black ops, missions that are so classified that few details are known to anyone outside of the immediate chain of command.<br />Jeremy Waller is an FBI agent selected to be a member of the highly trained Hostage Rescue Team, and he couldn't be more excited.  He enjoys the camaraderie with his fellow team members, and he loves the weaponry and the gadgetry that go along with the job.  Waller is an expert marksman, and he thinks creatively and clearly under pressure.  What Waller does not know is that he will soon be tested in ways that he could never have imagined when he signed up for membership in the HRT.<br />Another major character in &quot;Black&quot; is an embattled senator, Elizabeth Beechum, who is framed for a crime that she did not commit, and whose reputation and freedom are in grave jeopardy.  Who is out to destroy this powerful Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee?  Could her adversary be Jordan Mitchell, CEO of Borders Atlantic?  His gigantic telecommunications company is about to introduce a new cellular phone that will enable terrorists to plan their attacks with no danger of electronic interception.  Also in the equation is the beautiful Sirad Malneaux, a woman who uses her obvious physical attractions to pry secrets out of rich and powerful men.<br />Whitcomb shifts frequently from one principal player to another, until the plot resembles an intricate jigsaw puzzle whose pieces are scattered all over the floor.  The author reveals only those pieces that he wants you to have.  In &quot;Black,&quot; Whitcomb includes some of the usual elements that writers of spy thrillers dearly love, including the aforementioned gorgeous and seductive female with a hidden agenda, hired mercenaries, and oodles of high-tech gizmos.  However, Whitcomb succeeds in making the old formula seem fresh.  He includes timely references to the war on Iraq and Al-Qaeda, and he shows a deep understanding of the high-stakes jockeying for power and influence that is going on both in our nation's capital and in corporate America.  &quot;Black&quot; is thoroughly entertaining, with enough excitement, action, and surprises to please even the most jaded of readers.

Jane was a 52-year-old writer for a food magazine when she realized that she was sinking fast emotionally.  Her marriage was beginning to fray, she spent an inordinate amount of time loitering around the house in her bathrobe, and she suffered from panic attacks.  Sessions with therapists were not helping. Stern started to turn her life around with a new therapist, and she decided that in order to help herself, she would have to help others.  She studied to become, of all things, an Emergency Medical Technician with the volunteer fire department in Georgetown, Connecticut.  This was a strange choice for a woman who was emotionally shaky and chronically terrified.<br /><br />&#34;Ambulance Girl&#34; is both hilarious and poignant.  Stern recalls how she had to overcome her claustrophobia and fear of moving vehicles before she could ride in an ambulance. She also writes with wit and disarming candor about her many shortcomings.  When she first started out, she made so many mistakes that she felt sorry for the victims who were stuck with her as their EMT! On various occasions, she found herself babbling incoherently into her two-way radio, forgetting her eyeglasses and watch when she went out on a call, and accidentally kicking the broken hip of an elderly lady who was lying helplessly on the floor.  In spite of her initial ineptitude, Stern became a competent EMT, and she was gratified to discover that her work invigorated her and imbued her with a new sense of purpose.<br /><br />Stern deserves a great deal of credit for lifting herself out of a deep depression and gaining the acceptance of the Georgetown firemen and her fellow EMT's.  &#34;Ambulance Girl&#34; is an entertaining and unusual account of a brave woman's determination to face her fears and bring out the best in herself against all odds.all odds.	2004-06-11

Julie Spencer-Fleming's \\"Out of the Deep I Cry\\" is another one of those dark mysteries in which long buried secrets come to the surface years later with devastating results. The heroes of the novel are Clare Fergusson and Russ Van Alstyne, two people who are deeply attracted to one another in spite of the fact that Van Alstyne is married. Clare is an Episcopal priest of the Millers Kill Church in the Adirondacks and Van Alstyne is the chief of police.<br />Clare and Russ team up to find out what happened to the local doctor, Allan Rouse, who has suddenly disappeared. Did he commit suicide or was he the victim of foul play? The doctor's disappearance comes at a time of upheaval in the community. Money that was supposed to go to Rouse's medical clinic is being rerouted to Clare's church, which is badly in need of emergency repairs. The medical clinic is a memorial to Jonathan Ketcham, a farmer who vanished in 1930 after suffering a series of terrible tragedies. Ketcham was never seen again, and his widow, Jane, set up the clinic in his memory.<br /><br />Spencer-Fleming uses flashbacks to shed light on the connections between the past and the present. She shifts from the 1930's to the 1950's and back to the present day to show how the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fit together. The scenes from the 1930's, in which we find out what really happened to Jonathan and Jane Ketcham, are poignant, powerful, and deeply affecting.<br /><br />I was less impressed by the characters and events in the present. Clare Fergusson comes off as a bit of a hypocrite. She is a priest who goes out of her way to do good works for her community, but at the same time, she becomes emotionally involved with a married man. Van Alstyne reluctantly allows Clare to stick her nose in police business, even though she has no training as a law enforcement officer. Spencer-Fleming writes credible dialogue and the mystery is well plotted, but most of the characters in the book are flawed individuals who do unethical things to get what they want. \\"Out of the Deep I Cry\\" is an engrossing mystery with a cynical point of view about the human condition.unethical things to get what they want. \\"Out of the Deep I Cry\\" is an engrossing mystery with a cynical point of view about the human condition.	2004-06-06

Jack Kerley's &quot;The Hundredth Man&quot; is set in Mobile, Alabama, and it features the detective team of Carson Ryder and Harry Nautilus.  Ryder, who is the first person narrator, had a terrible childhood with an abusive father and a psychotic brother.  He later pursued his interest in deviant behavior by interviewing killers in prison for his master's degree in psychology.  Now, he is a cop and, together with Nautilus, they make up the Psychopathological and Sociopathological Investigative Team.  It is their mission to look into those homicides that appear to have been committed by emotionally disturbed individuals.  When a series of decapitated bodies with hand-written messages on them begin to appear, Carson and Harry are on the case.  Obstructive colleagues in the police department try to hamper their progress, but the two detectives are undeterred in their search for the killer.  One of the most annoying police officers is a vicious steroidal hulk named Sergeant Earl Burlew who, for some reason, constantly chews on pieces of the local newspaper.<br />&quot;The Hundredth Man&quot; is a preposterous and clich&eacute;-ridden police procedural.  It is written in a hard-boiled style that is overdone and quickly becomes tedious.  One of the book's irritating conceits is that Carson turns to his insane brother, Jeremy, for insights into catching serial killers.  Since Jeremy is himself a serial killer, supposedly he can figure out how every other serial killer operates.  The perp in this book is a stereotypical kook with a mother complex.  The convoluted plot makes very little sense and the denouement is almost laughable.  At one point, our hero uses his thigh as a scabbard for his knife so that he will not lose it.  I know that Carson is tough, but I don't think anyone would use his thigh as a knife-holder.  An example of some of Kerley's awful writing is, &quot;I was no longer a Ryder . . . I was a blazing creation of hate and vengeance and white hot fury.&quot;  Even a somewhat poignant plot line, in which Ryder bonds with a female alcoholic and tries to save her from herself, cannot redeem this heavy-handed and over-the-top novel.n a somewhat poignant plot line, in which Ryder bonds with a female alcoholic and tries to save her from herself, cannot redeem this heavy-handed and over-the-top novel.	2004-06-03

Jonathan Nasaw's &quot;Twenty-Seven Bones&quot; has some of the author's trademark touches.  There is never any doubt that the killers are two extremely demented anthropologists, Phil and Emily Epp. They are delusional megalomaniacs who lure their victims with promises of buried treasure.  There is no treasure.<br />&quot;Twenty-Seven Bones&quot; takes place on the fictional island of St. Luke in the Caribbean.  The police chief, Julian Coffee, asks his old pal, former FBI agent E. L. Pender, to look into the possibility that a serial killer is loose on St. Luke.  Pender, who has always been obese, has gotten even fatter in retirement, and he is bored with golf.  He figures that a change of scenery might be just the ticket to get him out of his funk, so he takes Coffee up on his offer.<br />Nasaw is a clever and skilled writer.  The best part of the book is the setting, which Nasaw plays up to the hilt.  He describes the island of St. Luke so thoroughly that I began to believe it really exists.  He gives it a history, complete with hurricanes, riots, and Danish colonial rulers.  The natives speak in a charming dialect, which is derived from a local idiom actually used in the U. S. Virgin Islands.<br />The characters are humdingers, as well.  In addition to the aforementioned sick puppies, the Epps, there are a number of offbeat people in this book.  One of them is Holly Gold, a gay Jewish expatriate and massage therapist who is on St. Luke to care for her orphaned niece and nephew.  The nephew, Marley, was born without arms, and he he manages to do a whole host of things using just his feet.<br />The main problem that I have with this book is the over-the-top depiction of the Epps. This couple is so perverted in every way that they seem cartoonish rather than real.  A more realistic villain is a wealthy and spoiled Danish man, Lewis Apgard, who is descended from the former governors of the island. He is a drunk and an opportunist who is willing to break the law to get what he wants.  Nasaw fleshes him out nicely, and he seems more human than the monstrous Phil and Emily.<br />I love the unconventional character of E. L. Pender, who is the anti-hunk.  He is a bald and lumbering man who dresses in loud and tasteless clothing.  However, Pender's unprepossessing appearance is deceptive. He has inner strength and self-confidence, as well as a very sharp mind.  Pender is an intuitive and persistent investigator whose experience in the FBI makes him the perfect person to catch the &quot;Machete Man,&quot; the serial killer who is preying on the citizens of St. Luke.  Nasaw wisely allows Pender to look weak and vulnerable at times, instead of depicting him as an infallible hero.  The author also gives Pender a love life, which is kind of nice since Pender could never be mistaken for Brad Pitt.<br />&quot;Twenty-Seven Bones&quot; is not for the faint of heart.  This book is for readers who like complex mysteries, and who can tolerate scenes of graphic violence and depraved behavior.  It is an exciting and involving thriller that cements Nasaw's reputation as a daring writer who pushes the envelope more and more with each succeeding novel.o get what he wants.

Judith Guest, most celebrated for her classic novel, &quot;Ordinary People,&quot; has written a new suspense novel. The protagonist of &quot;The Tarnished Eye&quot; is Sheriff Hugh DeWitt, who lives in Blessed, Michigan, with his wife and young daughter.  He is grief-stricken over the sudden death of his infant son, and he and his wife are trying to keep their shaky marriage going.  Two other people struggling with marital problems are a wealthy couple, Paige and Edward Norbois, who have an elaborate summer home in Blessed. Edward is a stern and inflexible husband and father.  Family disharmony mars what should be an idyllic vacation for Paige, Edward, and their four children.<br />Suddenly, a gruesome multiple homicide shocks the citizens of Blessed, and Sheriff DeWitt is under pressure to make a quick arrest.  With few resources at his disposal, Dewitt has to secure the crime scene, interview witnesses, and keep the media frenzy under control.  One of his prime objectives is to find out if the murderer is a random psychopath or someone who had a reason to target these particular victims.<br />Judith Guest has written a compelling whodunit with wonderful Michigan ambiance, engrossing characters, and plenty of suspense and red herrings to keep the reader off balance.  Sheriff DeWitt is an intelligent and compassionate man who is anxious to bring justice to the victims.  Unfortunately, he is too tied to the past to pay close attention to his wife's and even his own pressing emotional needs.  &quot;The Tarnished Eye&quot; is an exciting and involving murder mystery in which Judith Guest astutely explores the dark and complex recesses of the human mind.	2004-05-30

Elizabeth Berg's new novel, &quot;The Art of Mending,&quot; is the story of three grown siblings who have some unfinished business.  Laura and Steve have always considered their sister, Caroline, to be a weird and overly sensitive drama queen.  One day, Caroline declares that she wants to talk to her siblings about some terrible events that happened when she was a child.  A crisis brings the family together, and finally, Caroline reveals  what has been troubling her since she was a little girl.<br />Elizabeth Berg is known for her skill at exploring family dynamics.  She understands that much of what goes on between close relatives is unspoken subtext.  Problems are often swept under the rug, only to emerge years later in a virulent form.  In her previous novels, Berg impressed me with her psychologically astute observations about love and human nature.<br />However,  &quot;The Art of Mending&quot; is not one of Berg's best efforts.  Although the author writes with keen insight about her characters' internal conflicts and turbulent emotions, the plot feels melodramatic and artificial.  In addition, the characters are one-dimensional rather than fleshed out human beings. Although I was eager to learn the truth about Caroline's long-hidden secret, I ultimately grew tired of reading about this family's angst.	2004-05-28

The two protagonists are reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, but Cyrus Barker and Thomas Llewelyn are not merely pale imitations of Doyle's inimitable characters.  Barker is a brusque &quot;enquiry agent&quot; who is shrewd, versatile, and an expert at martial arts.  Llewelyn, Barker's newly hired assistant, is a poor Welshman who, thanks to a wealthy benefactor, studied at Oxford.  Sadly, his career as an academic was derailed when he was unjustly sent to prison for eight months at hard labor.  With no job prospects in sight and not a penny to his name, Llewelyn is thrilled to have a job, but he is a bit worried when he finds out that the gentleman he replaced as Barker's assistant was shot and killed in the line of duty.<br />Sir Moses Montefiore, the patriarch of London's Jewish population, hires Barker and Llewelyn to investigate the brutal murder of a young scholar named Louis Pokrzywa in London's Jewish quarter.  Montefiore fears that resentment against the Jews of London is on the increase, and he wants Barker to find out whether anti-Semitism was the motive for Pokrzywa's murder.<br />For a first novel, &quot;Some Danger Involved&quot; is an impressive achievement.  Thomas, who is a librarian and a Victorian scholar, gets the physical atmosphere and the feel of London's disparate neighborhoods just right, and he has a flair for creating colorful characters.  The novel is fast-paced and Thomas writes with dry wit and a good ear for dialogue.  Whether he is describing an elderly rabbi, a Chinese chef, an aloof butler, or an Italian thug, Thomas brings each individual to life.<br />The book's one weakness is its anticlimactic ending.  I was expecting a better payoff after a rather lengthy buildup.  However, I still give Thomas high marks for creating a promising new series featuring a clever and mutli-talented sleuth, Clive Barker, and his eager young apprentice, Thomas Llewelyn.ung apprentice, Thomas Llewelyn.	2004-05-28

When he was twenty-five, life seemed to have endless promise.  He was an up-and-coming television news producer who felt physically fit and self-confident.  One day, Cohen dropped a coffee pot, and he chalked it up to a clumsy moment.  On another occasion, he was standing at a curb and he lost his balance for no apparent reason.  He gave these symptoms little thought until his leg began to itch and Cohen realized that the outside of the skin on his leg was completely numb.  After speaking with his father, a physician, Cohen learned that he has multiple sclerosis, a devastating and potentially crippling disease.<br />&quot;Blindsided&quot; is not just a story of sickness and physical deterioration.  It is also a testament to the faith, love, and determination of a very special family.  Cohen married Meredith Vieira after he was diagnosed with MS.  They have three children whom they adore, and they have remained unified throughout many years of suffering and sacrifice.  Besides his battle with MS, which has left him legally blind, Cohen has also survived two bouts of colon cancer.<br />Each day, Cohen lives with the knowledge that he will most likely never recover his strength, that he cannot work at the job he adores, and that his wife and children will see him growing weaker as the years pass.  Yet, he chooses to fight back by doing his utmost to remain as strong as he can, and by setting an example of courage that is an inspiration to those who know him.  Although Cohen's prose is not subtle or elegant, his story is compelling, unforgettable, and unflinchingly honest.  After reading this powerful book, most readers will consider every day of good health to be a tremendous blessing that should never be taken for granted.	2004-05-28

Grace Lawson is a happily married mother of two whose world is suddenly shattered when her husband, Jack, disappears.  Harlan Coben's &quot;Just One Look&quot; follows Grace's desperate efforts to find out where her husband went and why.  Did he leave of his own volition or was he abducted?  The one clue that Grace has is a twenty-year-old photo that shows her husband with four other people.  Who are these people and what do they have to do with Jack's disappearance?<br />&quot;Just One Look&quot; has a strong opening but it falters towards the middle and completely falls apart at the end.  Many books deal with a husband or wife who vanishes without a trace.  It's one of the oldest and most effective hooks, since a missing spouse is sure to grab the reader's attention and gain sympathy for the protagonist. However, in order to sustain interest, the author must also create well-developed characters and an engrossing plot.  Coben does neither.  Jack is a cipher, Grace is little more than a frightened and confused woman, and the villains are straight out of central casting.  Two of the clich&eacute;s in &quot;Just One Look&quot; are a mob-connected wiseguy out for revenge and an Asian killing machine who disables his victims with his bare hands.<br />In almost every thriller written today, the reader expects the obligatory twists and turns towards the end, and Coben dutifully provides plenty of surprises.  These unexpected plot developments do not save the book because they are too illogical and melodramatic to be taken seriously.  &quot;Just One Look&quot; promises a great deal with a very exciting opening, but the convoluted and overwrought conclusion undermines everything that has gone before.	2004-05-24

Matekoni.<br />This time around, McCall Smith deemphasizes Mma Ramotswe's investigations and places more stress on the everyday activities of the characters that we have come to know and love.  Mma Potokwane, the formidable matron of the orphan farm, is pressuring Mr. Matekoni to take a parachute jump for charity.  Mma Makutsi, Mma Ramotswe's capable assistant, is excitedly making plans to move into a new home.  Meanwhile, tongues are wagging as to why Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni are still engaged after so much time.  Why aren't they making wedding plans?  Speaking of weddings, a wealthy businesswoman is looking for a husband.  She retains Mma Ramotswe to investigate a group of potential suitors to determine whether they are more interested in marrying her or her money.<br />The author weaves these and other stories together seamlessly into a whimsical, funny, warm, and touching novel.  Once again, Mma Ramotswe waxes ecstatic about how lucky she is to live in the noble country of Botswana with its physical beauty and its long-standing traditions of kindness and neighborliness.<br />As I read this series, I cannot help but be struck by how such simply written books can be so moving and engrossing, and by how thoroughly captivating the characters are.  I adore Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni and I cherish the time that I spend with them.  &quot;The Full Cupboard of Life&quot; is a lovely book that renews one's faith in humanity's essential goodness.	2004-05-23

With smooth and effortless style, the author relates how six people, one man and five women, come together to talk about Jane Austen's books.  During the meetings of the book club, not only do the members explore Jane Austen's life and novels, but they also reveal a great deal about themselves.<br /><br />Jocelyn and Sylvia are in their early fifties and have been friends since they were eleven.  Bernadette is sixty-seven and although she has made a career out of being married, she is currently single.  Allegra, Sylvia's daughter, is a blunt and beautiful woman, with a quick wit and an acerbic tongue. Sylvia's husband, Daniel, has just asked for a divorce after over thirty years of marriage.  She is still bewildered by the changes in her life.  Prudie is the only happily married member of the club.  She teaches French and has an irritating and pretentious habit of dropping French phrases into the conversation without translating them. Grigg is a man in his early forties who doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the book club, but he does provide a much-needed male perspective.<br /><br />Fowler is deliciously witty.  She pokes fun at and deconstructs, among other things, book clubs, friendship, marriage, and Jane Austen.  At the same time, Fowler brings her six protagonists into focus, giving us a peek into their childhoods and providing perspective on how they became who they are now.<br /><br />Jane Austen's books are worlds unto themselves.  Austen cleverly and astutely examined the mores of her time, especially as they related to love and marriage.  Fowler does the same.  She reveals that each of her characters has suffered disappointments and harbors painful memories and secrets.  None of them, however, has given up on life.<br /><br />The dialogue in this novel is hilarious and poignant.  The author includes a summary of Austen's novels at the back, along with a droll, tongue-in-cheek \\"Reader's Guide\\" that is the essential element of all modern book clubs.  In addition, Fowler adds a lengthy section in which she gives critics of Jane Austen their say.  Whether or not you are a lover of Jane Austen or a member of a book club, you will find much to enjoy in this breezy and entertaining novel.r's Guide\\" that is the essential element of all modern book clubs.

Lee Child's &quot;The Enemy,&quot; which is set in 1990, is an engrossing prequel to his popular Jack Reacher series.  At the time, the Berlin Wall was coming down and Communism was weakening.  The Cold War was almost over, the political climate was changing, and the generals in the army were coming to the realization that they, too, would have to change.<br />Those of us who have followed Jack Reacher's escapades know him as a footloose civilian with few ties to anyone.  In &quot;The Enemy,&quot; Child goes back to Reacher's days as an investigator for the 110th Special Unit in the United States Army.  Major Reacher is puzzled when a series of unexplained transfers has many commanders being moved around like pieces on a chessboard.  Reacher himself has been abruptly transferred, without explanation, from Panama to Ford Bird, North Carolina.  One night, Reacher is informed that a two-star general named Kramer has been found dead of an apparent heart attack in a seedy motel. Reacher is called in to keep the matter from becoming an embarrassment to the army. What Reacher doesn't know is that Kramer's death is about to set off a deadly chain reaction.<br />&quot;The Enemy&quot; is an exciting and intricate novel about the many ways that people bend the rules to get what they want in life.  The large cast of characters includes a beautiful and brilliant lieutenant named Summer, who helps Reacher investigate a series of homicides even after he has been ordered to call off his inquiries.  Reacher and Summer risk their careers and their lives to follow the clues wherever they may lead.<br />Child is an accomplished action-adventure writer, and he maintains suspense nicely as the book's plot becomes more and more complex.  The novel's sole weakness is its implausibility.  Some of the events and the motivations in the book strain credulity.  However, if you are willing to suspend disbelief, you will enjoy rooting for Reacher. He is a strong-willed and tough individual who is shrewd, loyal, and honest to a fault. When he finds out that his values are not shared by many of his fellow soldiers, Reacher begins to lose faith in the army. &quot;The Enemy&quot; reveals the genesis of the Jack Reacher we know today--a cynical loner, who is slow to trust and reluctant to form long-term relationships.

Amy Sherman and Tara Messer are &quot;Best Enemies,&quot; in Jane Heller's new novel.  As children, Tara always took the spotlight and Amy basked in Tara's glow.  Tara was always gorgeous and popular, and Amy was thrilled just to be around someone who was vivacious and garnered so much attention.  Amy's and Tara's relationship nosedives, however, when Tara steals Amy's boyfriend, Stuart, just weeks before their wedding.  Tara sets up housekeeping in grand style with Stuart, while Amy pursues a career as a publicist.  The two women run into one another four years later, and Amy is so devastated by Tara's obvious success and happiness, and so angry at Tara's patronizing manner, that she lies to her former friend and pretends that she is engaged to a smart and hunky guy.<br />To make matters worse, Tara writes a potentially successful book about living the beautiful life and sells it to Amy's publisher. Amy is forced to work as Tara's publicist, although the very thought of seeing Tara frequently makes Amy sick to her stomach. In addition, Amy needs to find a guy who is willing to play the part of her fianc&eacute;.<br />&quot;Best Enemies&quot; is very funny, but it has some serious elements, as well.  Heller perfectly captures the importance of female friendships.  Although women can sometimes be petty and jealous, they also share their most private thoughts with their friends, and they rely upon one another for advice and support.  Although Amy and Tara are now at each other's throats, they cannot forget that for many years they meant a great deal to one another.<br />Heller cleverly splits the book between Amy's and Tara's points of view.  We learn that each woman has her imperfections, her insecurities, and her secrets, and that they both share the blame for keeping their enmity alive.  &quot;Best Enemies&quot; is funny, romantic, and even giddy at times, with many farcical elements that keep the book from becoming too serious.  Amy's wisecracks and Tara's overblown opinion of herself are the stuff that comedy is made of, and there are plenty of laughs and even a few thought-provoking moments in this entertaining book.opinion of herself are the stuff that comedy is made of, and there are plenty of laughs and even a few thought-provoking moments in this entertaining book.	2004-05-10

When I picked up &quot;Every Secret Thing,&quot; by Laura Lippman, I expected nothing more than a formulaic novel about child abductions.  Much to my surprise, this book turned out to be a deeply psychological page-turner with marvelously descriptive writing, dry humor, and intricate plotting.  Now that I have finished the book, the highest compliment that I can pay to Ms. Lippman is that she reminds me of the great British novelist, Ruth Rendell.  Why?  Rendell has never been satisfied with the standard whodunit formula.  She likes to examine the unexplored dark corners of the human psyche and the mystery is not always the centerpiece of her books.  The people are.<br />&quot;Every Secret Thing&quot; begins with a tragedy.  A little girl named Olivia Barnes is kidnapped and, several days later, she is murdered.  Two eleven-year-old girls named Ronnie Fuller and Alice Manning are charged with the crime, and they spend seven years in juvenile detention facilities.  When they are released, Ronnie and Alice are young women of eighteen.  Before long, when another little girl named Brittany goes missing, Ronnie and Alice are once again under suspicion.<br />There are so many things to praise about this book that it is difficult to pick one, but above all else, the character development is uniformly outstanding.  We get to know each major and several minor characters intimately, as if they were our own neighbors.  Lippman gives us a glimpse into the minds of Ronnie and Alice, two unhappy and lonely misfits with a tenuous grip on reality.  We become well acquainted with Helen Manning, Alice's narcissistic and foolish mother, Nancy Porter, the cop who found Olivia's body and has been haunted by the case ever since, and Cynthia Barnes, Olivia's bitter and grieving mother whose life is devoted to seeing Alice and Ronnie destroyed.  That the two girls responsible for killing Olivia should be set free to walk the earth is simply not an option for Cynthia, who has powerful political connections and is used to getting what she wants.<br />As the story unfolds, a tale of psychological horror emerges that is truly chilling.  When I turned the last page, I knew that I would be thinking about this book for some time to come, marveling at how Lippman mines so many themes so effectively, and how she makes us care deeply about the outcome of her story.

In Michael Connelly's latest thriller, &quot;The Narrows,&quot; Bob Backus once again appears on the scene to taunt his old friends at the FBI.  For those who don't remember him, Backus, known as &quot;The Poet,&quot; was an FBI agent as well as a vicious serial killer, who has left a trail of corpses behind him in both the United States and Europe.<br />Harry Bosch, retired Los Angles cop, is also back.  Graciela McCaleb, the widow of Terry McCaleb, asks Harry to look into her husband's sudden death.  McCaleb, the central character in Connelly's novel, &quot;Blood Work,&quot; was an FBI profiler whose life was saved by a heart transplant. After leaving his job, McCaleb continued to work cold cases unofficially; he was pursuing promising leads in the Poet case, among others, when his heart gave out for the last time. Although Harry no longer carries a badge, he has been working as a private investigator, and he agrees to help Graciela.  Harry soon begins to suspect that Terry's interest in the Poet may have led to his death.  Along with Rachel Walling, an FBI agent who had worked with Backus in the past, Harry sets out to find the Poet before he kills yet again.<br />&quot;The Narrows&quot; is a terrific police procedural, every bit as dark and menacing as &quot;Lost Light,&quot; Connelly's last Bosch novel.  It has all the elements we have come to love in the Bosch series:  feuding and manipulative FBI agents, tantalizing clues, sharp and witty dialogue, and a touch of romance. There are also amusing references to the Clint Eastwood movie, &quot;Blood Work,&quot; that hint at Connelly's displeasure with the &quot;Hollywood treatment&quot; given to his book.<br />I have always liked Harry Bosch.  He is smart, cynical, compassionate, and tough, and if he's on a case, you know that he'll see it through until the bitter end.  Connelly's complex plot had me impatiently turning pages into the night, and the surprises kept on coming until the book's dramatic conclusion.  If you are a fan of novels with great characters, lots of action, and twists and turns galore, you will enjoy &quot;The Narrows&quot; as much as I did.If you are a fan of novels with great characters, lots of action, and twists and turns galore, you will enjoy &quot;The Narrows&quot; as much as I did.	2004-05-09

The heroine is Eve, a woman whom a group of Benedictine nuns in France take in after she is shot in the head and left in a ditch to die.  Eve survives, but her memory is gone.  She has no idea who she is or why someone tried to kill her.  Occasionally, Eve has nightmares hinting at a tumultuous and violent past that is quite different from her placid existence in the convent.  Suddenly, Eve is forced to flee, and since her sole clue is a ferry ticket from Morocco that she finds among her possessions, she decides to travel to North Africa in an attempt to rediscover who she was in her former life.<br />Eve's journey takes her to Tangier, Marrakech, and eventually, to Bratislava.  As she tries to piece together the jigsaw puzzle of her history, she must also avoid those who want her dead.  Eve meets a mysterious and handsome man named Brian who may have some of the answers Eve seeks, but will Brian prove to be friend or foe?<br />Jenny Siler sets up her plot well, and for the first half of the book, I turned the pages quickly to find out what would happen next to this attractive and courageous heroine. Siler handles the exotic locales nicely, and her lively descriptions of Tangier and Marrakech add to the book's atmosphere.  I also liked the novel's terse, no-nonsense dialogue.<br />Unfortunately, the denouement of the book does not have the same energy as the setup, and at the end, the story begins to meander.  As Eve travels from place to place, she meets a variety of individuals, each of whom has a piece of the puzzle.  Although I like Eve, the other characters in the novel lack depth, and the solution to the mystery is melodramatic and a bit muddy.  However, &quot;Flashback&quot; is, at least for the first half, a gripping spy thriller. Once hooked, you will want to hang on to learn the truth about Eve.	2004-04-30

Carolyn Sullivan, the protagonist of Nancy Taylor Rosenberg's &quot;Sullivan's Law,&quot; works for the Ventura County Probation Department by day and attends law school at night.  She is a divorced mom who is struggling to make ends meet and is also trying to find the time to give her kids the attention that they need.  Carolyn is not only beautiful, but she is also brilliant, ethical, and courageous.<br />Carolyn puts her career and her life at risk when she goes to bat for Daniel Metroix, a schizophrenic ex-con who was convicted of murder and served a long prison term before finally being released.  She believes that Daniel, who happens to be a genius at physics and math, was framed for a murder that he did not commit and that his life is in danger now that he is out on the street.  Carolyn goes out of her way to become an advocate for Daniel, while she tries to find out who really committed the murder for which he was unjustly convicted.<br />&quot;Sullivan's Law&quot; is an action-packed and fast-paced police procedural.  It has violence, romance, family drama, nasty bad guys, and a murder mystery all rolled into one.  The downside is that the dialogue is stilted and the plot is incredibly contrived.  Carolyn survives so many brushes with death that I began to think she must have nine lives.<br />If you enjoy an escapist police procedural with an appealing and overachieving heroine, &quot;Sullivan's Law&quot; might be worth your time.  If you like character development and a well-developed plot, then you may find &quot;Sullivan's Law&quot; disappointing.	2004-04-26

In Jonathan Kellerman's latest thriller, &quot;Therapy,&quot; Los Angeles psychologist Alex Delaware and homicide detective Milo Sturgis investigate the brutal murder of a young man and his girlfriend.  The two victims, Gavin Quick and the unidentified woman who was found with him, were parked in a lonely area outside of Los Angeles when they were both shot in the head.  Delaware, who consults for the Los Angeles Police Department, lends his psychological expertise to the investigation.<br />Sturgis and Delaware learn that Gavin had been seeing a popular therapist named Dr. Mary Lou Koppel, an egotistical publicity hound who is a frequent guest on radio and television talk shows.  Milo and Alex are startled to learn that one of Koppel's former female patients had also been brutally murdered.  Can the murders of Gavin Quick and this female patient somehow be related?<br />&quot;Therapy&quot; is a talky novel in which Sturgis and Delaware spend most of their time interviewing dozens of people, sometimes more than once.  In between interviews, they frequent various restaurants and bars while they mull over the particulars of the case.  Slowly, Alex and Milo begin to shed some light on this complicated mystery.<br />The plot of &quot;Therapy&quot; is engrossing and the characters are lively enough. One aspect of the book that I found interesting is that the author, himself a respected clinical psychologist, depicts three psychologists in &quot;Therapy&quot; who have bad judgment and questionable ethics.  Although the book would have been even stronger with tighter editing, &quot;Therapy&quot; is still an entertaining thriller with some original twists and turns.	2004-04-25

Some people cheat to make money; others do it to make themselves look more accomplished than they really are.  Callahan explores not only why people cheat, but also how American institutions encourage cheating, and what we, as a society, should do to reverse this growing and alarming trend.<br />Callahan fills his book with a host of examples, including lawyers who overcharge their clients, doctors who are paid by pharmaceutical companies to prescribe inappropriate drugs, students who cheat on their SAT's, athletes who take performance-enhancing drugs, and corporate bigwigs who engage in financial chicanery.  He also cites examples of famous cheaters, such as Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky, who were convicted and served jail time for their financial crimes, and Kenneth Lay, the top man at Enron, who has still not been prosecuted for his role in a huge scandal that rocked the business world.<br />&quot;The Cheating Culture&quot; is a thorough and very readable account of a serious problem in our society that receives far too little attention. The many anecdotes and interviews in this book bring home the pervasiveness and even the institutionalization of cheating in our country.<br />I give particularly high marks to the final chapter of &quot;The Cheating Culture,&quot; in which Callahan offers his ideas for attacking the problem head on.  The author suggests that we attempt to rediscover and reinforce the principles of honesty, teamwork, and shared responsibility in our homes, schools, and businesses.  Callahan believes that children should be taught ethical behavior in school and parents should be careful to set a proper example for their children.  He also suggests that the federal government take its role as a watchdog more seriously, policing and punishing those who evade taxes, engage in creative accounting, and steal from their shareholders.  Before we tackle a problem, we have to recognize that it exists.

Barbara Nadel's novel, \\"Belshazzar's Daughter,\\" has an intriguing premise.  Cetin Ikmen, a chain-smoking and hard-drinking detective on the Istanbul police force, is investigating the murder and mutilation of an elderly Jewish man named Leonid Meyer.  Someone used acid to torture Meyer and then painted a swastika on a wall near the corpse.  Is this heinous act the work of a right-wing anti-Semite or is there a less obvious motive?<br />Nadel, who according to the book jacket has visited Turkey frequently, makes good use of her exotic locale to lend a touch of originality to what is essentially an ordinary whodunit.  Ikmen and his partner Suleyman interview everyone who knew Meyer, and they look into the victim's past to see if it might shed light on who hated him enough to kill him so brutally.  The colorful cast of characters includes the unlucky Robert Cornelius, a depressed British expatriate with a checkered past, a beautiful temptress named Natalia, and Natalia's grandmother, Maria Gulcu, a strange woman who knows a great deal more about Meyer's death than she's willing to reveal.  There is also Reinhold Smits, a known Nazi sympathizer who once employed Meyer and then summarily dismissed him.  Which of these suspects holds the key to the mystery?<br />As the story unfolds, it becomes more and more convoluted and less credible, and the ending of \\"Belshazzar's Daughter\\" is way over the top.

Sarah Dunant's \\"The Birth of Venus\\" takes place in Florence during the Italian Renaissance.  The delightful narrator, Alessandra Cecchi, is a precocious, willful, and outspoken young woman who is fluent in Greek and Latin, knowledgeable about philosophy, and talented in art.  Alessandra's father is a successful cloth merchant and the family lives in a beautiful palazzo.  When Alessandra's father hires an artist to decorate the family's chapel, Alessandra is intrigued by the reclusive and moody young man.  However, she is under pressure to marry as soon as possible, and her father will arrange a match that he deems suitable for his daughter, regardless of her wishes.  Alessandra tells her story against the backdrop of powerful forces that are bringing sweeping political, religious, and economic changes to Florence.<br />\\"The Birth of Venus\\" is a meticulously researched page-turner that is filled with fascinating details about Florence in the late 1400's and early 1500's.  Through Alessandra's eyes, we learn about the disparity between the wealthy and the poor, the role of religion in the lives of the Florentines, and the gender inequities that kept women in their place.  Dunant captures the tumultuous time in Florence when the great Lorenzo de'Medici died and the fanatical monk, Savonarola, with his mesmerizing sermons and uncompromising views, ruthlessly took control of the city.  The author's vivid descriptive writing brings to life both the beauty and the decadence of Florence during the Renaissance.<br />Alessandra is a terrific, albeit flawed, heroine.  She is intelligent, passionate, and talented, but she is also reckless, imprudent, and impatient. She is a young woman who is anxious to break free of the restrictions that prevent her from expressing herself freely.  In spite of a few unfortunate melodramatic touches at the end, \\"The Birth of Venus\\" is an enthralling novel that will captivate readers who enjoy lively historical fiction.	2004-04-14

Peter Clement scores with \\"Mortal Remains,\\" a crackerjack medical thriller.  Dr. Mark Roper is a dedicated country doctor in Hampton Junction, a small town in upstate New York.  He is shocked when the body of Kelly McShane is pulled up from a lake, twenty-seven years after she mysteriously disappeared.  Kelly used to baby-sit for Mark and he idolized her.  It was no secret that she was anxious to leave her abusive husband, Chaz Braden, and there were hints that she had a mysterious lover. Mark decides to investigate Kelly's death, especially since the police regard her murder as a cold case that is unlikely to be solved. Helping Mark with his investigation is Dr. Earl Garnet, who knew Kelly when they were both medical students.  As their probe deepens, the two doctors risk becoming the next victims of a murderer who wants to keep old secrets buried.<br />This story could have been trite in the hands of a lesser writer.  Clements uses the \\"murder victim found many years later\\" formula skillfully.  He develops his characters with care and brings his story to life with vivid descriptions, interesting medical details, and a sharply delineated plot with some surprising twists and turns.  Dr. Roper is a sympathetic protagonist, a compassionate and hard-working doctor who has a special relationship with his elderly and isolated patients.  His adversaries are complex individuals with hidden motives, and there are plenty of red herrings to keep even the sharpest reader off balance.<br />If you like medical thrillers with lots of tension, varied characters, a well-developed plot, and a touch of romance, then you will probably find \\"Mortal Remains\\" both engrossing and entertaining.	2004-04-11

Lucy and her sister Anna have always been emotionally malnourished.  They never felt close to their aloof, self-centered, and chain-smoking mother, and after their father has a serious accident, he is no longer there for them.<br />Lucy and Anna have gone through life avoiding meaningful relationships.

Sims understands that, of all the bloody battlefields in the world, in some ways the home is the most brutal one of all.  Close relatives have the ability to heal or destroy one another.  Sometimes, family members do not even know the damage that they are causing until it is too late.

As a long time fan of Peter Robinson and Val McDermid, I opened my first Ian Rankin book with great anticipation.  &quot;A Question of Blood&quot; features Scottish Detective Inspector John Rebus, who in many ways reminds me of Alan Banks, the protagonist of the Robinson police procedurals.  Both Banks and Rebus are mavericks who dislike authority, drink and smoke to excess, are estranged from their families, and have unerring intuition about criminal cases.  Recently, Banks has begun to mellow.  He has kicked the cigarette habit and he is making an effort to get in touch with his more sensitive side.  Rebus, on the other hand, clings tightly to his vices and has a long way to go in the sensitivity department.<br />In &quot;A Question of Blood,&quot; Rebus and his partner, Detective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke are investigating a school shooting in which an intruder, Lee Herdman, apparently killed two students, wounded a third, and then turned the gun on himself.  In a second investigation, Rebus himself is in the hot seat.  The police suspect him of being involved in the brutal killing of Martin Fairstone, a vicious ex-con who had been stalking Siobhan.  Rebus had motive and opportunity, and his hands were mysteriously burned on the same night that Fairstone died in a suspicious fire.  If any hard evidence comes to light tying him to the crime, Rebus will face a murder charge.<br />Rankin masterfully depicts the crusty, unpredictable, and tenacious Rebus.  He is married to his job, and continues to pursue his investigations even while he is in excruciating pain with two scalded hands.  Siobhan Clarke is a dedicated and courageous detective in her own right, and Rankin fascinatingly choreographs her relationship with Rebus.  The partners work well together and care greatly for one another, but is their relationship merely platonic?<br />The plot of this novel is not as intriguing as the colorful characters that populate the book. Unfortunately, school shootings have become too frequent in society, and many authors have already used this plot device.  No new ground is broken here.  The book's story becomes much too complicated as &quot;A Question of Blood&quot; meanders to its melodramatic and overly eventful conclusion.  Rankin's themes include drugs, teenage rebellion, illegal gun sales, opportunistic politicians, and emotionally damaged army veterans.  Although I recommend this mystery for its lively and memorable characters, I give it lower marks for its convoluted and derivative story line.ome too frequent in society, and many authors have already used this plot device.

Suzanne Brockmann writes romantic thrillers in which gorgeous guys and beautiful women risk their lives doing heroic deeds.  In &quot;Flashpoint,&quot; Jimmy Nash and Lawrence Decker are good friends who accept a job in covert operations with a company called &quot;Troubleshooters, Inc.&quot; Their job is to enter a dangerous country named Kazbekistan in the guise of relief workers.  Their objective is to retrieve a laptop left behind by a terrorist before he died.  The laptop may reveal important secrets about planned terrorist attacks.  Much to Nash's and Deck's surprise, a computer specialist named Tess Bailey is also hired for this mission.  Tess once had an intimate encounter with Nash, and Deck is secretly in love with her.  Things could get hot in Kazbekistan.<br />&quot;Flashpoint&quot; is a bit hard to take seriously because the protagonists spend much of the time taking off their clothes.  In spite of the importance of their mission, romance is never far from their minds.  Although Decker is in love with Tess, he is also attracted to Sophia, a beautiful American who has escaped the palace of a cruel warlord whom she tried to kill.  Decker would like to help Sophia leave the country before the warlord finds her.  Most of the time, however, Tess and Nash are either irritated with one another or having face-to-face close encounters.<br />Brockmann tries her best to make &quot;Flashpoint&quot; timely, using references that resonate with the reader in this age of terrorism.  She handles the actions sequences well enough and, although the book is a bit too long, she keeps the pace moving briskly.  If you like romantic action-adventure with the emphasis on romance, not realism, then you may find &quot;Flashpoint&quot; entertaining.	2004-04-04

Fans of Tova Mirvis's debut novel, &quot;The Ladies Auxiliary,&quot; have waited impatiently for &quot;The Outside World,&quot; a book about Jewish families in transition.  Tzippy Goldman is a woman in her early twenties whose mother pressures her constantly to find a husband and settle down.  After suffering through over forty failed dates, Tzippy goes to Israel where, ironically, she meets and falls in love with a man whom she admired as a teenager.  The boy whom Tzippy once knew as Bryan Miller has been changed forever by his years of study in Israel.  Bryan now wants to be called by his Hebrew name, Baruch, and he is no longer content to be &quot;Modern Orthodox,&quot; like his family.  He is now a &quot;black hat Jew,&quot; following all of the commandments of the Torah to the letter, with no room for compromise.  Baruch's parents and sister are uncomfortable with his transformation.  They regard him as a self-righteous and condescending young man who no longer even pretends to fit in with their lifestyle.<br />Mirvis starts off her novel promisingly.  She ably describes the many differences among Orthodox Jews that often lead to conflict instead of cooperation and understanding. She also nails the tremendous upheaval that making a lavish wedding causes in a family that cannot afford to pay for such an overdone affair.  In addition, Mirvis astutely portrays the friction between parents and children, who often hurt one another without realizing how much pain they are causing.<br />However, as the book progresses, Mirvis goes off in too many directions.  She flits from one troubled character to the next and from one plot line to another, but the various elements do not always mesh.  We learn about Baruch's attempt to make it in the business world while retaining his religious fervor, Tzippy's decision to go to college, Tzippy's mother's depression, and her mother-in-law's search for spirituality and meaning in her life.  As the narrative becomes more scattered, it becomes less compelling.  If Tova Mirvis has written \\"The Outside World\\" with a tighter focus, it could have been a richer commentary on the challenges of being an Orthodox Jew in the twenty-first century.it becomes less compelling.

Former cop Tom Redmon is a depressed widower who works intermittently and unenthusiastically as a defense lawyer.  He is barely making ends meet and he uses alcohol as an emotional anesthetic.  Tom is jolted out of his drunken stupor quickly when his daughter, Jane, suddenly goes missing in \\"The First 48,\\" by Tim Green.<br /><br />Jane Redmon is a journalist who gets a hot tip about a corrupt and influential senator named Michael Gleason.  Before she has an opportunity to write an explosive and damaging expos' about Gleason's illegal activities, Jane is kidnapped and her apartment is ransacked.  Tom and his good friend, investigator and computer hacker Mike Tubbs, decide that the only way to bring Jane back safely is to do the job themselves.<br /><br />\\"The First 48\\" has crisp dialogue, non-stop action, nasty bad guys, and a ripped-from-the-headlines bioterrorism plot.  Tom Redmon and Mike Tubbs are entertaining enough and Jane is the kind of spunky heroine that I like to root for.  However, the plot device of relatives and friends taking the law into their own hands has been done many times before, and the story eventually sinks under the weight of too many cliches.	2004-03-28

Liz is living a quiet life as a psychology professor in Santa Barbara, California.  Her father, known as the \\"Carnivore,\\" was a deadly assassin for hire, and Liz used to be a spy for the CIA. Suddenly, Liz's placid existence is disrupted when some very powerful and important people suspect that she has the Carnivore's secret files.  These individuals will not hesitate to kill in order to get their hands on this potentially embarrassing information.<br />\\"The Coil\\" consists mostly of chase sequences and conversations among conspirators.  While running for her life, Liz teams up with Simon Childs, a spy for British intelligence who is romantically interested in her.  Meanwhile, Liz's cousin, Sarah, and her spy husband, Asher, have been kidnapped to put additional pressure on Liz to turn over her father's secrets.<br />At over four hundred pages, \\"The Coil\\" is padded with too many battles, incarcerations, and escapes.  With its well-worn conventions, it rarely rises above the level of the average spy novel.  If escapism and non-stop action is what you want, then you might find \\"The Coil\\" diverting.  If you prefer original dialogue, well-developed characters, and meaningful themes, this run-of-the mill and wearying novel will disappoint you.	2004-03-21

Lizzie and Frances are nearly identical twins in &#34;A Spanish Lover,&#34; by Joanna Trollope.  Lizzie and her husband have a business, four children, and a beautiful home.  Frances, on the other hand, is unmarried and seems to be drifting along without a sense of direction.<br /><br />Frances at last decides to step out of her sister's shadow and become her own person.  She starts a travel business, which becomes a great success, and she begins an unconventional love affair with a married Spaniard.  Meanwhile, Lizzie and Richard suffer serious financial setbacks that threaten their comfortable lifestyle.  Lizzie, who has always been self-satisfied and even-tempered, cannot help but be jealous and resentful of her twin's financial and emotional independence.<br /><br />Joanna Trollope is a contemporary Jane Austen.  With a keen eye, she examines how time, economic circumstances, and romantic entanglements can upset the delicate balance of a relationship.  She also explores the theme of whether we should try to please our families or ourselves.  Trollope shows how making life-altering decisions can involve some serious tradeoffs.  As one character in the book aptly states, &#34;There is no change without sacrifice.'' The author's writing flows naturally and her language is lyrical and beautifully descriptive. The characters are vividly portrayed and the dialogue is humorous, poignant, and insightful.  I highly recommend &#34;A Spanish Lover&#34; for its rich detail and its penetrating look at contemporary family life.	2004-03-18

In Tom Perrotta's latest novel, &quot;Little Children,&quot; the author focuses his microscope on the marital problems of suburban mothers and fathers with young children.  Thirty-year-old Todd is a former jock and a blonde hunk dubbed &quot;The Prom King&quot; by the playground mothers. He is a stay-at-home dad who takes care of three-year-old Aaron while his gorgeous wife, Karen, works as a documentary filmmaker.  Todd has failed the bar exam twice, as his wife reminds him repeatedly, and his prospects of ever becoming the family breadwinner seem dim.  Sarah is a college graduate who is stagnating mentally as a stay-at-home mom.  Her marriage to her businessman husband, Richard, is in the doldrums.<br />The other playground mothers watch in horror as Sarah strides up to Todd one day and kisses him the first time that they meet.  Sarah arranges to &quot;bump into&quot; Todd and the two forge a strong bond that threatens their fragile marriages.<br />The characters in this book are out of touch with their spouses, themselves, and, at times, with reality. Although Perrotta's writing is often humorous, this book is not merely a lighthearted satire of suburban mores and modern marriage.  There is much ugliness here, mostly centered on the townspeople's horrified reaction when a convicted sex offender moves in with his mother after a stint in prison.  One bitter retired ex-cop named Larry engages in a personal vendetta to harass the ex-con and his aged mother.  Todd goes along for the ride, and although he verbally protests, he never makes much of an effort to stop Larry from committing his horrible deeds.<br />&quot;Little Children&quot; is a brilliant and merciless look at the sterility of suburbia and at the dark emotions that threaten the characters' placid and predictable lives.  Most of the individuals in this novel are hypocritical, selfish, and immature.  Nevertheless, Perrotta is such a gifted writer that he humanizes the characters and makes us care deeply about them.  The author implies that even when we grow up and become parents ourselves, in some ways we all remain &quot;little children&quot; inside.ut them.

Letty Cottin Pogrebin, the cofounder of Ms. magazine and the author of eight works of nonfiction, has written her first novel.  &quot;Three Daughters&quot; is about half-sisters who lead complicated and multi-faceted lives.  Leah is an English professor and an ardent feminist who tends to be pedantic, opinionated and overbearing.  Rachel, the mother of five, is a domestic diva with a deep interest in Jewish theology. Shoshanna is a nervous type. Like Chicken Little, she is forever afraid that the sky is about to fall.<br />Leah, Rachel, and Shoshanna have a stormy history, and Pogrebin demonstrates that sisterhood can be a strong bond as well as a source of resentment, envy, and conflict.  Pogrebin gives these three women well-defined personalities and we see how they change over time.  Illuminating flashbacks shed light on how their childhoods marked them for life.<br />Where Pogrebin falters is in her writing style and plot development.  She indulges in melodramatic and overwrought language when understatement and subtlety would have been more effective.  At a little under four hundred pages, the book goes on and on; less would have been more.  The author's feminist agenda takes center stage here and she pushes it so hard that it throws the narrative out of balance.  A novel should develop naturally rather than serve as a forum to deliver political statements.  Finally, the book is loaded with more angst than is needed in one novel.  Some of the themes in &quot;Three Daughters&quot; are long-buried family secrets and grudges, marriages on the rocks, child abuse, mental illness, mid-life crises, and Jewish rituals.<br />Who will enjoy this book?  Those who like to read about dysfunctional individuals who make an effort to bond after years of estrangement may find &quot;Three Daughters&quot; poignant and meaningful.  However, since I found this novel to be more tedious than entertaining, I do not recommend it.	2004-03-09

Ben's former legal assistant, Christina McCall, is now his partner. Christina would like to take her relationship with Ben to the next level, but Ben has never been able to acknowledge his deep feelings for Christina.<br />One day, a mysterious woman comes into the law firm of Kincaid and McCall, asking for Ben's help.  Her name is Ellen Christensen, and her son, Johnny, has been arrested for the vicious murder of a gay man named Tony Barovick.  When Ben sees Ellen, he is visibly upset, and he is adamant that he will not take Johnny's case. After Christina realizes that she will not be able to persuade Ben to change his mind, she decides to defend Johnny herself.<br />&quot;Hate Crime&quot; is one of the busiest books that I have read in some time.  Bernhardt starts off his novel with a kidnapping, and he then segues to Johnny Christensen's murder trial.  Mike Morelli, Ben's former brother-in-law, is also featured in this book.  Along with his attractive female partner and an alluring FBI agent, Mike is investigating a series of gruesome murders.  Ultimately, all of these plot lines somehow tie together.<br />Bernhardt's heart is in the right place when he tackles the theme that gay people have the right to live in peace.  The author demonstrates, through scenes of graphic violence, how hatred and prejudice can lead to brutal actions. However, as a thriller, &quot;Hate Crimes&quot; is flawed.  There are too many twists and turns that come out of left field, and some of the startling revelations at the end are incredibly far-fetched.<br />On the plus side, we long-suffering readers finally learn what has been bugging Ben all these years.  Bernhardt reveals some secrets from Ben's past that explain why he behaves so awkwardly around Christina.  These few tidbits, however, are not enough to redeem &quot;Hate Crime,&quot; which is too unfocused and heavy-handed to succeed as a legal thriller.em &quot;Hate Crime,&quot; which is too unfocused and heavy-handed to succeed as a legal thriller.	2004-03-07

The lead character is a young woman named Thursday Next, who has been through some harrowing adventures that culminated in the eradication of her beloved husband.  She is pregnant and needs some time to regain her peace of mind.  Surely, the place to relax is \\"The Well of Lost Plots,\\" which consists mostly of unpublished books that will never make it into print.  Thursday takes up residence in a badly written and boring crime thriller named \\"Caversham Heights,\\" a book that is generally considered to be beyond repair.<br /><br />Alas, Thursday is unable to enjoy her newfound serenity for long. She needs to study for her Jurisfiction Entrance Exam, and it is a tough test.  Jurisfiction is a policing agency that works inside books to uphold their integrity.  Thursday is studying under the guidance of her strict but kind mentor, Miss Havisham. When a murderer begins to knock off members of Jurisfiction, both Thursday and Miss Havisham risk their lives to apprehend the perpetrator and bring order back to the world of reading.<br /><br />Fforde has created a new and imaginative universe called the BookWorld, a place that is filled with a whole host of interestingly named curiosities.  For example, there are \\"TravelBooks\\" that enable Jurisfiction agents to move smoothly and quickly from one book to another, and \\"generics,\\" creatures that are created with no personalities and no history, who will eventually be fleshed out so that they can become characters in books.<br /><br />\\"The Well of Lost Plots\\" is a bibliophile's delight, with its cunning and satirical allusions to such classic works as \\"Anna Karenina,\\" \\"Lord Jim,\\" \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" and \\"Moby Dick.\\"  Fforde is both paying homage to and making fun of these great works, and his humor and wit are a joy for anyone who loves the written word.  Thursday is an amiable character and her adventures are engaging and lighthearted fun.<br /><br />On the downside, \\"The Well of Lost Plots\\" is too long.  It slows down considerably in the middle, and I had to struggle to make my way to the end of the book.

Late one night, he is called to the scene of a suspicious fire that has claimed the lives of two people, an artist and a young woman. Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot, a woman with whom Banks once had a personal relationship, is helping him on this case.<br />When the fire proves to have been deliberately set, Banks, Cabbot, and their team look into the backgrounds of the victims.  Why were these two people targeted?  Was the fire set to kill both individuals, or was only one the intended victim?  The investigation turns out to be a complicated one, with many disparate elements such as child abuse, art forgery, identity theft, and illegal drugs.<br />I have always loved the nuanced and fascinating character of Alan Banks, who is a terrific homicide detective with unerring professional instincts.  Unfortunately, his life off the job is not as successful.  Banks was disconsolate when his wife, Sandra, divorced him.  She has since remarried and given birth to a baby girl. Alan lives alone, and he regrets that his devotion to his job may have helped to destroy his marriage.<br />This case brings much grief to Banks.  The killer is a clever and elusive individual who will do anything to protect himself and who has no scruples about using people to get what he wants.  Banks must dig deep into the past to discover the identity of the killer.  His investigation puts him and Annie in emotional and physical danger, and the conclusion of \\"Playing with Fire\\" is tense, exciting, and unnerving.  Although the plot of this mystery has some glaring weaknesses, Robinson redeems himself with his descriptive powers and his knack for creating lively and complex characters.

His old boss from the Israeli Intelligence Service, Ari Shamron, appears one day with devastating news about an explosion in Vienna.  Gabriel is not anxious to go back to the city where his wife and son had been victims of a car bomb in 1991.  However, Shamron persuades him to return to this \\"forbidden city\\" to investigate the bombing of the Wartime Claims and Inquiries Office, which left two young women dead and an old friend, Eli Lavon, in a coma.<br />Gabriel soon learns that a man named Max Klein had set the events in motion that may have led to the bombing.  Klein had once been a violinist in the Auschwitz camp orchestra and he had a particularly vivid memory of a Nazi named Erich Radek. In front of Klein, Radek once killed fifteen concentration camp prisoners in cold blood when they could not correctly identify a musical piece by Brahms.  Many years later, Klein spots this same war criminal placidly having coffee in a Viennese caf&eacute;, and he reports what he has seen to Eli Lavon, who then begins to make the inquiries that almost cost him his life.  Gabriel's investigation leads him to make some horrifying discoveries, the most painful one being the heart-rending story of his mother's two years of hell as an inmate of Auschwitz-Birkenau.<br />Silva writes with great feeling about the harrowing events of the Holocaust and the culpability of those who helped the Nazis escape punishment after the war ended.  In addition, Silva convincingly makes the point that radical right-wing political parties still pose a serious threat around the world, and that we must do everything in our power to protect our civil liberties in the face of these extremists.  \\"A Death in Vienna\\" is fast-paced, compelling, and filled with intriguing twists and turns.

She lives in an elegant section of London and she has made her mark as a respected writer.  Bettina has not forgotten her roots, however.  She is writing her memoirs based on her recollections of life as a young girl in the Australian outback town of Bundaroo in New South Wales, Australia.<br />Barnard alternates between events in the present and the past.  Much of the book recounts Bettina's memories from her childhood in Bundaroo during the 1930's.  She recalls her father's struggle to eke out a living in a wasteland beset with crop disease, drought, and extreme heat.  She also remembers her unusual friendship with Hughie Naismyth, an English boy who comes to live in Bundaroo with his family.  Hughie is artistic and a little condescending to his classmates, and he becomes the target of bullies.  Since she is fond of Hughie, who is a brilliant boy, Bettina does everything in her power to defend and support him.  This makes Bettina a target as well.  Suddenly, a terrible act of violence impels Bettina to leave Bundaroo and start a new life elsewhere.<br />Sixty-five years later, another vicious attack disrupts Bettina's placid existence and she realizes that somebody may want her dead.  But why?  Do they want to get their hands on her considerable fortune and her valuable artwork?  Or do they want to silence her before she reveals long buried secrets from her past?<br />Robert Barnard is most effective in the flashback scenes that take place during Bettina's childhood in Bundaroo.  Barnard brings the town's inhabitants to life, showing not only how close-knit the residents were, but also depicting their clannishness, petty rivalries, and small-mindedness.  When Barnard fast-forwards to the present, however, the pace slows down and the book loses some of its flavor.

The young men love carousing, drinking, and getting high. One night, after a late party, the four literally stumble upon the body of Rosie Duff, a young woman who had been brutally assaulted, stabbed, and left to die.  The police consider the four lads to be suspects.  However, since there is no solid evidence connecting them to the crime, they are not charged.  However, the shadow of Rosie's death hangs over them for the rest of their lives. Twenty-five years go by.  The four young men move on with their lives, but Rosie's death has not been forgotten.  After so much time has passed, the men become the targets of a determined killer.<br />When she is in top form, Val McDermid is truly splendid, as she proved in her wonderful novel, &quot;A Place of Execution.&quot;  However, &quot;The Distant Echo&quot; is a paint-by-numbers thriller.  The plot is recycled from innumerable books with the theme that old murders and long-buried secrets never die.  In addition, at over four hundred pages, the novel is much too long and repetitious.  Most unfortunate of all, the ending is so clearly telegraphed that there is absolutely no suspense in the final pages.<br />The only positive statement that I can make about &quot;The Distant Echo&quot; is that the four protagonists are an interesting and varied lot whose personalities change over time.  I cared about these characters and I was interested to see what would become of them.  However, it took a great deal of patience to finish this book, and only the most determined McDermid fans will want to pick up &quot;The Distant Echo.&quot;	2004-02-16

The Padgitts are not at all happy with Willie Traynor's coverage of the Kassellaw murder.  Danny even has the temerity to tell the jurors that if they convict him, he will get them sooner or later.<br />With &quot;The Last Juror,&quot; Grisham is in top form.  He beautifully depicts the assorted characters in Clanton, including the corrupt politicians, the drunken reporters, the gun-toting citizenry, and the good Christians who have a personal relationship with the Lord.  One of most memorable characters is Miss Callie Ruffin, a black woman who has raised eight children, seven of whom went on to earn PhD's.  Willie writes a lengthy and complimentary feature in his newspaper on Miss Callie and her family.  He also becomes Callie's dear friend and a frequent guest at her bountiful table.  Miss Callie is the first black woman voter as well as the first black juror in Clanton, having been picked to serve on the Padgitt jury.<br />&quot;The Last Juror&quot; has suspense, excitement, warmth, and gentle humor.  Without preaching, Grisham perfectly captures the racial tension and the social upheaval of rural Mississippi in the seventies.  He tells his story through Willie Traynor with effortless simplicity and with great affection.  &quot;The Last Juror&quot; is a pleasure to read, and it is one of Grisham's finest novels.social upheaval of rural Mississippi in the seventies.

Stephen White's latest thriller is &quot;Blinded,&quot; featuring Boulder, Colorado psychologist Alan Gregory and his good friend, detective Sam Purdy.  Alan and Sam both have plenty of problems to deal with.  Alan's wife, Laura, is a prosecutor who suffers from multiple sclerosis, and Sam has to deal with his recently diagnosed heart disease and his troubled marriage.<br />A former patient of Dr. Gregory, Gibbs Storey, has come back to Boulder after living for ten years in California with her husband, Sterling.  Gibbs startles her doctor with the revelation that Sterling may have murdered a woman with whom he had been involved.  Even more surprising, Gibbs wants her doctor to report Sterling to the authorities.  Normally, Dr. Gregory would do no such thing, but Gibbs is both gorgeous and vulnerable and, against his better judgment, he decides to help her.<br />Meanwhile, Sam Purdy is on medical leave after suffering a heart attack, and he decides to use his free time to investigate Sterling Storey's activities.  Sam begins to suspect that Sterling killed quite a few women with whom he had relationships.  Although Sam is supposed to be recuperating, he decides to drive hundreds of miles to find out the truth about Sterling Storey. The detective is too restless to sit around the house.  He is licking his wounds after his wife, Sherry, took their son away for the Thanksgiving holiday.<br />&quot;Blinded&quot; is a book about people's inability to process information objectively, either about themselves or others.  Alan and Sam both find out the hard way that everyone needs a reality check every now and then, even an experienced psychologist and a homicide detective.  A person can be &quot;blinded&quot; by his misconceptions, and this blindness can have devastating repercussions.<br />Stephen White succeeds in holding the reader's interest by changing the point of view back and forth from Alan to Sam frequently.  This device can be irritating, but in White's skilled hands, we get a clear picture of how both men view the events in their lives.  I particularly liked the tender scenes between Alan and his ailing wife, Laura.<br />I was less enthralled with the plot of &quot;Blinded,&quot; which requires a huge suspension of disbelief.  In addition, I think that many readers will find the ending a bit too predictable to be truly exciting.  Still, I give &quot;Blinded&quot; a marginal recommendation, because it is fast-paced, populated with intriguing characters, and has nicely written, down-to-earth dialogue.  A stronger plot would have made it a top-notch thriller.ands, we get a clear picture of how both men view the events in their lives.

John Lescroart's \\"The Second Chair\\" is one of his best legal thrillers in years.  It features a fascinating character, Amy Wu, who is a thirty-year-old associate in Dismas Hardy's San Francisco law firm.  Wu has been on a downward spiral since her father died four months earlier.  She is drinking heavily, picking up strange men in bars, and doing shoddy legal work.  Dismas Hardy, a recurring character in Lescroart's novels, knows that Amy is in trouble, but he has problems of his own.  Since a series of tragic events changed his life, he has been reluctant to get emotionally involved in his work.<br />However, Dismas has to intervene when Amy's client, Andrew Bartlett, a seventeen-year-old rich kid, is arrested on a charge of double homicide.  Amy tries to manipulate the system to guarantee Andrew a light sentence, but her plan backfires, leaving Amy and her boss with egg on their faces. To save his firm's reputation and extricate Amy out of the legal trouble that she has created for herself and her client, Dismas decides to take \\"second chair\\" in the Andrew Bartlett case.<br />Dismas's close friend, Abe Glitsky, is also suffering from burnout and stress.  Glitsky has been promoted to Deputy Chief of Investigations, and he the hates the bureaucracy and politicking that go with his job. He also despises the vultures in the media who are always second-guessing his every move.  Abe yearns to do what he does best--solve homicides.  He has his chance when a series of mysterious murders rock the city, and he is once again called upon to use his investigative skills to find the murderer dubbed the \\"Executioner.\\"<br />\\"The Second Chair\\" is complex, fast-paced, and suspenseful. The dialogue is sharp and realistic and the plot is complex without being convoluted.  As always, Lescroart has done his homework, and the engrossing legal details add immeasurably to the book's appeal.  Lescroart also effectively explores the shortcomings of our criminal justice system and how politics and the media too often pervert the truth.<br />However, what I like best about this novel is its heart.  Lescroart takes the time to get inside the minds and personalities of all the major characters, and this gives the reader an emotional investment in the outcome of the story.  All in all, \\"The Second Chair\\" is a winner, and if you love legal thrillers as much as I do, you will put it at the top of your list.tics and the media too often pervert the truth.  <br />However, what I like best about this novel is its heart.

Matthew is an assistant to a Congressman, and Harris is the youngest chief of staff ever hired by a Senator.  Both young men are very bright, but they are a bit bored and looking for some laughs. They decide to play &quot;The Zero Game,&quot; in which they place bets on their ability to push through meaningless pieces of legislation.  No one gets hurt, the guys can make a few bucks, and it's all in good fun. Unfortunately for Mercer and Sandler, there's more to the &quot;zero game&quot; than meets the eye.  The seemingly trivial pursuit proves to be extremely dangerous for its participants.<br />Brad Meltzer, the author of &quot;The Zero Game,&quot; does well when he discusses the inner workings of Congress, especially the machinations of lobbyists, the horse trading that occurs during appropriations meetings, and the quid pro quos that grease the wheels of politics.<br />Unfortunately, it takes more than this to make a successful political thriller.  The plot of &quot;The Zero Game&quot; is both far-fetched and repetitious.  Brad Meltzer has written a book of over four hundred and fifty pages, with numerous descriptions of one chase sequence after another.<br />To his credit, Meltzer's good guys, Harris and Vivian Parker, a seventeen-year-old Senate page, are affable, intelligent, and engaging characters.  They are tough and idealistic, and they put up a good fight.  It is also refreshing that Meltzer does not include a hokey romantic subplot in this novel. However, the villains are straight out of central casting, the dialogue is stilted, and the unrealistic story goes on far too long.  As a political thriller, &quot;The Zero Game&quot; ultimately misses the mark.	2004-01-29

Dr. Powers also delineates ways in which parents can help children with AS during the difficult transition to adolescence and, later, to adulthood.<br />Dr. Powers clearly states what AS is and how it affects both the children that have it and their families.  He also explains how AS manifests itself in such areas as impaired social interaction, repetitive behavior, and difficulty in communicating with others.  Most important, the author outlines the many ways that AS children and their families can make the most out of a challenging situation.  Dr. Powers makes liberal use of interesting and relevant anecdotes from real children with AS.<br />Dr. Powers accentuates the positive at all times.  He emphasizes that with early intervention and ample support, individuals with AS can live productive and satisfying lives.  This is a hopeful and upbeat book with practical and detailed advice for anyone who wants to learn more about living successfully with AS.	2004-01-25

Sue Monk Kidd's first novel, \\"The Secret Life of Bees,\\" is the deeply moving tale of fourteen-year-old Lily Owens.  The year is 1964, a time of tumultuous social change in America.  Lily lives on a South Carolina peach farm with her vicious and abusive father, T. Ray.  Lily's beloved mother died under mysterious circumstances ten years ago, and Lily is still devastated by her loss.<br />\\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" is the story of Lily's odyssey in search of peace of mind, self-esteem, and most important of all, answers about her mother's past.  What was her mother like and how did she die?  The search eventually takes Lily and her caretaker, Rosaleen, to the house of August Boatwright and her sisters.  August is a fiercely proud black woman who is a successful entrepreneur.  She is a skilled beekeeper who sells her delicious honey all over the county.  Living with the Boatwrights, Lily learns all about beekeeping, compassion, forgiveness, and love.<br />Kidd's writing is tremendously evocative.  She captures the atmosphere of a small southern town in 1964, a place where deep-seated racism was prevalent and poisonous.  Kidd's varied cast of characters range from the cruel and bitter T. Ray to August's sister, May, a woman who is so sensitive that she acts as a lightning rod for the world's troubles.  Lily, the narrator of the story, is a deeply wounded soul who may burst if she doesn't find someone to care for her unconditionally.<br />Many novels have been written about the importance of sisterhood, a person's need to be treated with dignity and respect, and the redeeming power of love.  However, very few novels have the insight, warmth, humor, and beautiful descriptive writing of \\"The Secret Life of Bees.\\"  I recommend it highly.	2004-01-23

If you watch the two popular shows about crime scene investigation and keep your eyes glued to the screen when the corpses are examined minutely, you might like this book.<br />In \\"Stiff,\\" Roach has decided to take an up close and personal look at cadavers throughout history, going back to ancient times.  She examines such subjects as body snatching, human decay, brain transplants, cannibalism, and different ways to dispose of dead bodies.  Roach does all this in excruciating detail and with much gallows humor.<br />Although I am not particularly squeamish, I admit to feeling a bit uncomfortable with Roach's jovial attitude towards her subject.  She seems positively ecstatic to be in the room observing plastic surgeons practicing on forty heads laid out in roasting pans. Some readers may be put off by Roach's lighthearted tone while describing the many bizarre experiments carried out both on human beings and animals for the sake of \\"scientific inquiry.\\"<br />Roach is a talented writer who has done her homework.  Her chapters on how researchers investigate and try to prevent airplane and car crashes are informative and fascinating. The author does not rely on secondhand information when she can go straight to the source.  For example, Roach spends several days with Susanne Wiigh-Masak, a Swedish biologist-entrepreneur who founded a company that seeks to replace cremation with organic composting for human bodies. The reader learns more about the disposal of cadavers than he will ever need to know.<br />Should you buy this book as a birthday present for your grandmother or maiden aunt?  Probably not.  Should you read this book before sitting down to a big meal?  I wouldn't advise it.  However, if you have a burning scientific interest in how cadavers have been treated throughout history and what may be in store for the dead in the future, you will find no more thorough and entertaining treatment of this unusual subject.treatment of this unusual subject.	2004-01-18

The protagonist of Joseph Finder's new thriller, Paranoia, is twenty-six year old Adam Cassidy, who is a cog in the machine of Wyatt Telecom.  Partly to relieve his boredom, Adam pulls an expensive prank that could land him some serious jail time.  To escape a stint in the federal penitentiary, Adam agrees to become a spy for CEO Nick Wyatt, who orders Adam to steal corporate secrets from Wyatt's rival in the telecommunications business, Trion.<br /><br />Adam gets a job in Trion and, little by little, he obtains sensitive information that will allow Wyatt to gain a competitive edge over Trion.  There are only two problems.  What will happen to Adam if he gets caught, and how can he live with himself while he is betraying his employers and colleagues at Trion?  To add to Adam's woes, his father is dying of emphysema, and none of the caregivers whom Adam has hired is willing to put with the cantankerous and abusive old man.<br /><br />\\"Paranoia\\" is a first-rate novel about a young man with looks, personality, brains, a sense of humor, and ambition.  Adam has the potential to be a major player in the corporate world.  However, is he clever enough to evade the sharks that are circling in the water?  Will Adam sell his soul to become a part of this culture?  Is driving around in a Porsche, wearing expensive suits, and living in a fancy apartment worth the price of Adam's integrity?<br /><br />This is a savagely funny indictment of a dog-eat-dog culture that rewards manipulation, selfishness, and greed.  The plot is intricate, thoroughly engrossing, and immensely entertaining.  Finder writes wittily about the men and women who walk the walk and talk the talk in corporate America, but who lack compassion and a sense of fair play.  I recommend this highly involving page-turner for its fascinating characters, its sharp writing, and its cunning twists and turns.	2004-01-14

David Cray's new police procedural, &quot;Partners,&quot; is a gritty look at how a petty criminal becomes a cruel predator.  Twenty-seven year old Jorge &quot;Finito&quot; Rakowski is a small-time hood blessed with startling good looks but little else. Recently released from Rikers, with a long rap sheet, no education, and no job prospects, Finito relies mostly on theft to keep him afloat financially.  Finito soon discovers, much to his surprise, that he derives enormous satisfaction from killing women.<br />New York City police detecives Belinda Moore and Pudge Pedersson are partners.  As friends, they discuss their hopes, fears, and disappointments, and as professionals, they work well together.  Pudge and Belinda are convinced that one man is behind the murders of quite a few young women in recent months.  Their bosses do not agree with this theory, and they make Moore's and Pedersson's lives increasingly difficult.  However, Belinda and Pudge are old-fashioned cops who care about the victims, and they are determined to catch the killer any way they can.<br />Cray has done an excellent job of getting inside the minds of both a serial killer and the detectives who seek to bring him down.  We get to know Finito Rakowski, who is equal parts con artist, immature little boy, and sociopath.  We also become well acquainted with the two detectives, Moore and Pedersson, who have the same irritating personal problems that everyone else has, but who are focused on getting results when they are on the job.<br />Cray's writing is smooth and occasionally darkly humorous, his plotting is fast-paced and exciting, and his depiction of police procedure is authentic and engrossing.  I highly recommend &quot;Partners&quot; for an inside look at the grim world of two homicide detectives.	2004-01-13

Loomis decides to invite the music industry's movers and shakers to a launch party aboard a luxurious yacht.

Who abducted her and what do the kidnappers want?  Detective Steve Carella catches the case, and he is dragged into working with a Joint Task Force that includes some condescending federal agents.<br />In this novel of the 87th precinct, McBain takes a satirical look at the shallow people who market talent for the music industry.  He also exposes the graft and the political machinations that get the maximum amount of radio airtime for a new song. Money talks and there is a great deal of money to be made in the music business.<br />The cast of characters in &quot;Bandersnatch&quot; is large and varied.  Carella is a good cop who refuses to be manipulated by the big boys. He and his colleagues in the 87th precinct rely on reliable, old-fashioned detective work to solve cases.  For comic relief, Fat Ollie Weeks is enjoying a romantic interlude with his new lady friend, Patricia.  Tamar Valparaiso is a lovely young girl who is thrilled to be on the brink of stardom.  The villains of the piece are stupid, cruel, and selfish, a dangerous combination.  McBain juggles all of these characters with his usual wit and grand style.  &quot;The Frumious Bandersnatch&quot; is an engrossing detective novel with a slam-bang ending that brings home the perils of greed and unbridled ambition.	2004-01-11

Dr. Carroll Monks is an emergency room physician, employed in a San Francisco hospital, who is suffering from burnout.  He has a failed marriage under his belt, children he rarely sees, and a borderline drinking problem.  His girlfriend, Martine, seems ready to move on.<br /><br />Monks is on duty when a beautiful young woman named Eden Hale is brought in to the ER in excruciating pain.

Dr. Monks valiantly tries a controversial treatment to treat Eden, but he fails to save her.  The fallout from this episode may cost Dr. Monks his job. In an effort to prove that he was not responsible for Eden's death, Monks, along with his private investigator friend, Stover Larrabee, decide to look into Eden's background.  They discover that the world of the rich, beautiful, and famous is, ironically, one of ugliness, insecurity, jealousy, and selfishness.

Since Sarah has done missing persons work in the past, she takes personal leave to track her husband's movements just before he disappeared.<br />&quot;The 37th Hour&quot; is a strong first novel for Compton.  It is crisply written and very fast-paced, with interesting details about how missing persons investigations are conducted. Sarah is a smart and dedicated cop and she is a sympathetic protagonist.  The author vividly describes Sarah's efforts to remain objective while she is inwardly terrified that her husband may be injured or dead.  As her investigation deepens, Sarah must face the fact that her husband may have been keeping a large part of his life secret from her.<br />The weakest element of the book is the ending, which suffers from the &quot;startling revelations&quot; syndrome.  Too many authors write engrossing books in which the tension slowly builds, only to end their books with a series of far-out and melodramatic revelations and events. I was looking forward to the denouement of &quot;The 37th Hour,&quot; and I was disappointed with the contrived and unsatisfying conclusion.  A less sensational and more credible outcome would have worked better.  Nonetheless, I loved Sarah Pribek and I think that Jodi Compton has a real feel for writing thrillers.for writing thrillers.	2004-01-04

He sports a well-worn Chicago Cubs cap on his balding head, and he has little use for material possessions. His friends are an odd assortment of people, quite a few of whom live on the fringes of society.<br />What makes this seemingly unprepossessing man worth caring about? First of all, Lew has a soft and compassionate nature. He always offers assistance to those who have been battered by life, including Adele, a young unwed mother, Flo, a recovering alcoholic, and Digger, a homeless man. In addition, although Lew is not a licensed private investigator, he is an excellent sleuth. In \\"Midnight Pass,\\" Lew is hired to track down a missing wife for her distraught husband. Lew also attempts to give a dying cancer patient the opportunity to fulfill his final wish.<br />Kaminsky tells his story in a spare, quirky, and whimsical way. He presents an off-the-wall cast of characters who say outrageous things with a straight face. Lew's sessions with his deadpan psychologist, Ann Horowitz, are both funny and poignant. Although the mystery in \\"Midnight Pass\\" is engrossing enough, it is fairly conventional.

When Dr. Bell intercedes in the case, he uses his forensic skills, his intuition, and his uncanny powers of detection to get to the bottom of the affair.<br />Pirie is a superior writer and he brings all of the characters in \\"The Patient's Eyes\\" to brilliant life.  Doyle is a callow and troubled young man who comes from a dysfunctional family.  Bell is Doyle's mentor, and he may be the real life model for the great fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes.

However, when a key witness decides to recant her testimony in a death penalty case, she insists on telling her story to Corso.  He is back in the game.<br />Along with Meg Dougherty, a gifted photographer and a decent investigator in her own right, Corso reviews the case of Walter Leroy Himes.  Himes is about to be executed for murdering women across Seattle and leaving their bodies in dumpsters.  Although Himes claims that he never killed anyone, most of the victims' family members, the police, and a large segment of the public want Himes executed.

It is a romantic thriller featuring macho men and beautiful women in jeopardy.<br />Lt. Sam Starrett is a hunky Navy SEAL who had a terrible childhood living with an abusive and racist father.  Sam was rescued emotionally and physically by a black friend, Noah, whose grandfather served as a surrogate father and role model. Sam's focus is now on his soon to be ex-wife, Mary Lou, and his baby daughter, Haley, both of whom have disappeared, presumably the target of terrorists.  With the help of the love of his life, FBI Agent Alyssa Locke, Sam hopes to find Mary Lou and Haley. Alyssa, meanwhile, is romantically entangled with her boss, Max, who is still carrying a torch for a former hostage he once helped rescue during an airplane hijacking.<br />Does all of this sound impossibly complicated?  &quot;Gone Too Far&quot; has a great deal more plot in its four hundred and fifty pages than Brockmann can comfortably handle.  There is even a series of flashbacks going back to World War II describing the romance between Noah's grandfather and the woman who became his second wife.<br />Potential readers of &quot;Gone Too Far&quot; should be warned that this book has explicit dialogue and some very steamy romantic encounters.  If the repeated use of expletives and detailed anatomical references do not annoy you, you may be put off by the many cliches and the lack of realism.  However, in spite of its flaws, this novel's characters are undeniably charismatic, energetic, charming, and gorgeous. For fans of romantic thrillers that border on fantasy, &quot;Gone Too Far&quot; is an occasionally diverting romance that will provide a few hours of escapist reading.	2003-12-21

Both novels feature deadly conspiracies.  In both books, Robert has a female sidekick who is as beautiful as she is brainy.<br />Robert is called away from academia when he receives a mysterious telephone call at five in the morning.  The head of CERN, the world's largest scientific research facility, has summoned Robert to see a corpse.  An ancient brotherhood, known as the Illuminati, may have resurfaced.  They appear to have murdered and branded a renowned physicist, and they are threatening to destroy many other lives in their quest to bring down the Catholic Church.<br />Robert, along with Vittoria Vetra, daughter of the slain scientist, must retrace the path of the Illuminati in an effort to save lives before the villains can complete their deadly mission.  Robert's knowledge of symbology and iconology lead him to the Vatican archives, where he unearths ancient documents with important clues.  The novel is basically a race against time.  Will Robert decipher the hidden clues in time to foil the Illuminati?<br />I have several problems with &quot;Angels &amp; Demons,&quot; as I did with &quot;The Da Vinci Code.&quot;  The sole aspect of this book that is compelling is the obscure information about science and art.  The characters and dialogue are wooden, and the plot is formulaic melodrama.  The twists and turns at the end come very far out of left field.  At almost six hundred pages, the book is far too long and repetitious.  One particularly irksome habit is Brown's constant use of italics and exclamation points for emphasis.  This device wears thin very quickly. Although this series has undoubtedly captured the public's imagination, Brown lacks the narrative skills to bring his ideas to three-dimensional life in a work of fiction.life in a work of fiction.	2003-12-14

Dr. Malcolm Ishmail is a surgical resident in \\"Lie Still,\\" a medical thriller by David Farris.  Dr. Ishmail's life takes a huge downward spiral when he treats a thirteen-year-old boy named Henry Rojelio in an Arizona emergency room.  Henry Rojelio is an asthmatic and a frequent visitor to the ER.  However, he appears to be in no immediate danger when Dr. Ishmail examines him, and the resident orders a routine injection to ease Henry's symptoms.  Suddenly, Henry's condition deteriorates and he slips into a coma.<br />Malcolm is baffled and deeply troubled by Henry's condition. When a nurse reports him to his superiors as having bungled the case, he knows that his career may be in jeopardy.  How could a routine visit to the ER end up so disastrously?  Could this tragedy be related to a feud that Dr. Ishmail is having with the beautiful Dr. Mimi Lyle, a brain surgeon and Dr. Ishmail's superior?  After working with Dr. Lyle, Malcolm is convinced that her surgical skills are lacking, and he wrestles with the choice of reporting her or letting things slide.  Are the incidents with Henry and Dr. Lyle just ghastly coincidences?<br />In Dr. Malcolm Ishmail, Farris has created a realistic, likeable, and human protagonist to tell this intricate story.  The author, himself a doctor, provides clear and detailed medical background and a few doses of gallows humor to lighten up the serious proceedings. There is also an erotic subplot that is explicit and daring, but necessary to explain the characters' motivations.  The plot is tense, exciting, and thoroughly engrossing.  \\"Lie Still\\" is a promising debut novel from a very talented writer, and I recommend it for readers who love medical thrillers with substance.	2003-12-14

Ayelet Waldman's &quot;Death Gets a Time-Out&quot; is the fourth entry in her &quot;Mommy-Track&quot; mystery series.  The heroine is Juliet Applebaum, a public defender turned stay-at-home mom.  Now that her kids are no longer infants, Juliet has a part-time job as a private investigator with her good friend, Al Hockey.  Juliet and Al have been hired to find some exculpatory evidence that may help a young man named Jupiter Jones, stepbrother of Lilly Green, who is an Oscar-winning actress and an old friend of Juliet's.  Jupiter may face the death penalty for killing his lover and stepmother, Chloe Jones.<br />The &quot;Mommy-Track&quot; mystery series started out well, mostly because the first few books were light and breezy.  Juliet's sardonic sense of humor, often aimed at herself, was refreshingly droll, and the novels moved along quickly.<br />The same cannot be said for &quot;Death Gets a Time-Out,&quot; unfortunately.  This time, Juliet's whining is more annoying than amusing, and the mystery is so convoluted, tedious, and long-winded, that it was truly a chore to finish it.  This book needed some serious editing. By the time I finally reached the long-awaited conclusion, I was bored with the large cast of characters and their endless troubles.  &quot;Death Gets a Time-Out&quot; is neither amusing nor particularly absorbing, and I do not recommend it.	2003-12-07

Carl Houseman is the deputy sheriff of Nation County, Iowa, and the laconic narrator of Donald Harstad's new thriller, &quot;A Long December.&quot;  Carl is also the department's senior investigator, and it is his job to figure out who shot an unidentified male, execution style, in a remote area called Frog Hollow.  Was this death related to a drug deal gone sour?  Working along with Iowa DCI agent Hester Gorse, Houseman finds out that this crime is just the tip of a very dangerous iceberg that may have national implications.<br />The main characters in &quot;A Long December&quot; are a likable bunch, and they have a matter-of-fact and businesslike attitude towards danger.  Their dry humor and amiable camaraderie make them very easy to take.  It is also refreshing to read a crime thriller that takes places in the nation's heartland rather than in a major metropolitan area.<br />One irritating aspect of this book, however, is the repeated shifting back and forth in time between a gun battle and the events that led up to the shootout.  This dizzying flashback device is a needless annoyance that serves no dramatic purpose.  Harstad would have done better in this case to have Houseman tell his story in a more linear manner.<br />Still, &quot;A Long December&quot; has much to recommend it.  It raises some timely themes about our dangerous world and the men and women who risk their lives to defend us.  The plot is complex and engrossing and the author provides some fascinating information about how investigations are conducted.  It may not be flashy or glitzy, but &quot;A Long December&quot; gets the job done.	2003-12-07

D. James.  The setting is the Dupayne Museum, a small private institution near London's Hampstead Heath.  The museum features British art and cultural artifacts from 1919 to 1939. One of the museum's more popular attractions is the Murder Room where sensational murders of the time period are catalogued in detail.<br />Suddenly, the calm of the museum is shattered by a particularly brutal homicide, and Commander Adam Dalgleish is called in to investigate.  Dalgleish and his team interview the heirs of the museum's founder, Max Dupayne, the museum's small staff, and anyone else who might shed light on the terrible tragedy.  The police identify several possible suspects but, at first, no hard evidence points positively to a particular individual.<br />Several fatal flaws mar this mystery.  James's best novels are character-driven works with intriguing themes that explore the many facets of human behavior.  With one or two exceptions, the characters in &quot;Murder Room&quot; are an uninteresting and unappealing lot, and the endless round of police interviews with these people makes for dull reading.  It is too bad that Dalgleish's personal life plays such a small role in this book.  More emphasis on Adam as a human being might have livened up the novel considerably.<br />In addition, James includes many peripheral characters whose connection to the murders is tenuous, as well as a host of red herrings that are more irritating than challenging. Long before the book's conclusion, I found myself losing interest in the proceedings.  Since I have enjoyed so many Adam Dalgleish mysteries in the past, I was very disappointed by the uninspired and slow-moving &quot;Murder Room.&quot;	2003-11-30

Joseph Telushkin, in his latest book, &quot;The Ten Commandments of Character,&quot; explores a variety of ethical dilemmas that make life challenging for people who worry about doing &quot;the right thing&quot; whenever possible.  Most of the book is written in a question and answer format, and it includes material that was previously published in Telushkin's ethical advice column found on the Web site, Beliefnet.com.<br />Telushkin begins by outlining what he calls the &quot;ten commandments of character,&quot; and he then devotes the eight chapters of his book to ethical questions that relate to family, children, friends, work, money, medical ethics, everyday dilemmas, and community.<br />It is a pleasure to read Telushkin's clear, straightforward, and always entertaining prose.  He tackles a wide variety of questions that vary in importance from &quot;Should I assist my child in writing his or her college essay?&quot; to &quot;Should I promise my father that I will help him commit suicide if he develops Alzheimer's Disease?&quot; Telushkin is never flippant when he discusses grave matters.  He is caring, compassionate, and at times, ruthlessly honest.  Although I do not agree with all of Telushkin's advice, I find his ideas to be lucid and thoughtful.  Telushkin is a rabbi, but this book is not geared specifically to Jewish readers.  Many of the writers seeking advice are not Jewish, and Telushkin has the courage to admit that he holds some personal beliefs that are not strictly in line with Orthodox Jewish doctrine.<br />&quot;The Ten Commandments of Character&quot; is a practical book that ecourages people to examine their actions a bit more critically.  Telushkin urges the reader to make ethical decisions based on an honest assessment of the right and wrong of the situation, rather than settling for a convenient rationalization.  Admittedly, there are no absolutes in questions of morality and ethics, nor does the author claim omniscience or a special pipeline to God.  However, Telushkin performs an important service by making us think about such diverse questions as, &quot;Is stem cell research ethical?&quot; and &quot;Is it ever morally right to declare bankruptcy?&quot; If Telushkin's book makes at least a few readers behave with more honesty, self-control, compassion, and fairness, then he will have accomplished a great deal.line to God.

Reginald Hill's \\"Death's Jest-Book\\" is a British police procedural with a literary flair.  Hill's large cast of characters include Peter Pascoe, a Yorkshire policeman with a suspicious nature, Andy Dalziel, his obnoxious but canny superior, and Franny Roote, an ex-con who may or may not be on the road to rehabilitation.<br />Pascoe is the cop who put Roote into prison.  Now that Roote is free, he writes a series of long letters to Pascoe in which Roote claims to have embraced the rich and satisfying life of academia.  Pascoe, ever watchful and cynical, believes that Roote's letters may be veiled threats to Pascoe and his family as well as mocking references to crimes for which Pascoe has insufficient evidence to arrest Roote.  The letters irritate Pascoe and he is desperate to find a way to put Roote behind bars for good.<br />Hill skillfully deconstructs the minds of both policemen and criminals as he demonstrates that these seemingly opposite types have much in common.  To succeed in what they do, both the policeman and the criminal must be aggressive, tough minded, clever, and focused.  Neither profession is for the weak-willed.<br />\\"Death's Jest-Book\\" is filled with wry and sometimes hilarious humor, literary allusions, and surprising twists and turns.  The secondary characters, including a Detective Constable named Hat Bowler and his lady love, Rye Pomona, are as carefully fleshed out as the main players.  Hill takes his time examining the inner thoughts of each character, making it clear that underneath the superficial veneer that most people present to the world are a host of hidden fears, dark secrets, needs, and passions.<br />The book's one flaw is its excessive length and occasionally slow pacing.  At almost 560 pages, \\"Death's Jest-Book\\" from time to time gets bogged down in too much verbiage.  Still, Hill has created a fascinating world of con men and cops, all of whom are flawed human beings struggling to understand and cope with life's challenges.

It seems that a gladiatorial contest is being held in the New York Public Library between one human and six aliens.  The contest, known as the Presidian, is a fight to the death and only one entrant will remain alive at the end.  Participating against his will is a doctor named Stephen Swain.  Swain is teleported to the library, along with his eight-year-old daughter Holly, who comes along with her father by accident.  Swain has a guide to help him, a benign and diminutive alien named Selexin.<br /><br />&quot;Contest&quot; is non-stop adventure, with plenty of slime and gore for those who enjoy such things.  There is no character development to speak of, and there is not one shred of realism to disrupt the hyperactive proceedings.  Swain has no weapons at his disposal, except for whatever he finds lying around the library, and he needs to think quickly on his feet to outsmart his bloodthirsty opponents. Not only is Swain fairly cool under pressure, but his eight-year-old daughter is remarkably composed, considering the horrifying things that she sees during this unasked-for thrill ride.<br />If you enjoy weird aliens jumping out of dark corners to attack people, then &quot;Contest&quot; is for you.  In its own goofy way, it is kind of fun.  I must admit, though, that I hate the idea of people and/or aliens fighting to the death in a public library, especially since I am a public librarian.	2003-11-23

Many years ago, I read a story about Ignac Semmelweis that made him out to be a demigod.  According to the legend, Semmelweis was a martyr to the cause of saving women from unnecessary deaths due to puerperal or childbed fever.  In the early and mid-nineteenth century, childbed fever was ubiquitous and very often fatal in Europe and America.<br /><br />In his fascinating new book, \\"The Doctors' Plague,\\" Sherwin P. Nuland traces the history of this tragic disease and he sheds some light on how and why the medical profession was helpless to prevent it for so many years. Nuland goes back to the great physician Hippocrates, who, over two thousand years ago, described childbed fever with great accuracy. For all of his powers of observation, Hippocrates knew nothing about the causes of the disease or how to prevent it.  For many years, physicians promulgated wild theories, blaming the new mother's milk, bad air, suppression of discharges, and other equally irrelevant factors for the large number of infections that killed new mothers in hospitals.  The figures tell the tragic story.  At the London General Lying-In Hospital, between 1833 and 1842, 587 women per thousand died of childbed fever.  The mortality statistics were similar in hospitals throughout Europe and the United States.<br /><br />Ignac Semmelweis was born in Hungary.  As a practicing doctor of obstetrics, he was appalled by the large number of women dying in childbirth.  Because he was a keenly observant doctor who kept careful records and because he had a sharp, logical mind, Semmelweis eventually concluded that childbed fever was somehow passed to women from their doctors, nurses, and dirty bed linens.  He came to believe that simple handwashing with an antiseptic agent and providing new mothers with clean linens would sharply decrease the mortality rate from puerperal fever.<br /><br />Semmelweis was correct in his theory, but was hated for it.  Nuland carefully traces the political climate that made Semmelweis a pariah among his fellow physicians. In addition, the author blames Semmelweis for some huge lapses.  By refusing to publish extensive articles describing his clinical findings, by failing to carry out controlled experiments proving his theory, and by alienating those who could have helped him, He was reviled instead of respected, and many more women died as a result.<br />Semmelweis did not want to play the political game.  If he had done so, he might have become a member of the establishment instead of remaining an outsider.  Perhaps then, doctors and nurses would have observed the rules of hygiene before attending to women in childbirth, instead of flouting hygienic practices out of spite and ignorance.  Nuland's conclusions are still relevant today.  Even in the twenty-first century, politics and good health care are still on a collision course.s fellow physicians.

However, the war on terror is far from over in Joel Rosenberg's new political thriller, &quot;The Last Days,&quot; a sequel to the author's successful debut novel, &quot;The Last Jihad.&quot;  Most of the characters who survived the carnage in the earlier book are back, including Jonathan Bennett and Erin McCoy.  Bennett is a tremendously successful Wall Street strategist who gave up the good life to join the staff of his old friend, James MacPherson, the President of the United States.  Erin McCoy, a gorgeous CIA operations officer, is Bennett's partner.  Bennett and McCoy care romantically for one another, but they never seem to have the time or energy to act on their mutual attraction.<br />President MacPherson has dispatched Jon Bennett to the Middle East to convince the Israelis and Palestinians to sign a peace treaty.  It seems that there are tremendous oil and natural gas reserves off the coast of Israel and Gaza.  The United States is willing to help turn these reserves into a multi-billion dollar enterprise if the warring factions decide that it is in their best interests to stop the violence.<br />Before Bennett can get his &quot;oil for peace&quot; plan off the ground, a shocking act of violence throws the region into turmoil.  Jonathan's mission appears to be dead on arrival.  Furthermore, he and his comrades find themselves in the middle of a bloody civil war with no obvious means of escape.<br />Rosenberg's staccato writing style is very effective. &quot;The Last Days&quot; is packed with crisp dialogue, fierce battles, fanatical terrorists, and lots of high tech gizmos and weaponry.  Although the characters are rather one-dimensional and the plot is only occasionally realistic, the exciting story barrels along so quickly that the reader gets caught up in the adrenaline rush.

These secrets lead to an unanticipated series of events that end in murder.<br /><br />&#34;Now May You Weep&#34; features a nice change of scenery.  Crombie makes the most of the beautiful Scottish countryside where the story is set.  She describes the heather-clad moors, the rolling hills, and granite cliffs of the Highlands in vivid detail.  A number of the characters speak in a colorful Scottish dialect, which adds to the book's atmosphere.  Since some of the characters are whiskey distillers, Crombie takes the time to explore the history and manufacture of Scotch whiskey, which may be interesting for those who care about how fine whiskey is made.<br /><br />The problem arises with Crombie's plot, which turns out to be a bit of a potboiler.  Love triangles abound, and the melodrama is piled on fairly heavily by the time Crombie comes to her climactic conclusion.  She uses the same device that worked well in her previous book, namely a series of flashbacks that supposedly explain the events of the present day.  Unfortunately, this time around, the flashbacks are distracting rather than illuminating.  It is also too bad that Gemma and Duncan spend less time than usual together, and the story suffers for it.  The mystery is a little too forced, and the characters lack the psychological depth that we have come to expect from Crombie.  &#34;Now May You Weep&#34; is a disappointing installment is an otherwise above-average mystery series.orced, and the characters lack the psychological depth that we have come to expect from Crombie.  &#34;Now May You Weep&#34; is a disappointing installment is an otherwise above-average mystery series.	2003-11-09

Ruth Rendell's new Inspector Wexford mystery is \\"The Babes in the Wood,\\" the story of three mysterious disappearances.  A babysitter, Joanna Troy, has gone missing with the two adolescents, Giles and Sophie Dade, who were in her care. The neighborhood is flooded after torrential rains and Katrina Dade, Giles's and Sophie's hysterical mother, comes to the tearful conclusion that her children have somehow drowned.  Wexford is skeptical about this theory, and he begins his usual thorough investigation.<br />I have always liked Inspector Wexford.  He is a devoted family man who adores his two adult daughters, although he is not blind to their flaws.  He is bright, well-read, compassionate, bitingly funny, and tremendously intuitive.  Wexford has an uncanny knack for recognizing liars.  Since \\"The Babes in the Wood\\" is filled with liars, Wexford has many occasions to test his skill at separating truth from fiction.<br />Rendell does her usual workmanlike and competent job of setting up her complicated plot, and the characters are a varied and lively bunch.  The biggest problem with this novel is that the pace is, at times, a bit static.  For large portions of the book, Wexford interviews the relatives and acquaintances of the missing people.  These interviews are not scintillating enough to keep the book moving at a fast clip.<br />However, the mystery has an unexpected and clever solution, and Wexford once again proves that he is a shrewd detective and an excellent judge of human nature.  Rendell displays her marvelously mordant sense of humor and her jaded view of human nature.  She is truly a misanthrope's delight.  Most of the characters in \\"The Babes in the Wood\\" are selfish, disturbed, or manipulative.  Although \\"The Babes in the Wood\\" is not Rendell's best work, it is entertaining enough.  Devoted fans of the inimitable Inspector Wexford will find it a pleasure to observe the wheels turn as he slowly but surely gets to the bottom of a strange and perplexing case.	2003-11-02

Scarpetta is called in to consult on a cold case in Louisiana that may be related to the Chandonnes' crimes.<br />Cornwell flits from place to place in this book, as she tries to cover too much ground.  Kay Scarpetta is living a subdued life in Florida.  She has never recovered from the loss of her job as Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia and the loss of her lover, FBI Profiler Benton Wesley.  Another troubled soul is Pete Marino, Scarpetta's close friend.  Marino is self-destructive in the extreme, although he has always been a great cop.  He has issues of his own that make his life a living hell.  Meanwhile, Kay's brilliant niece, Lucy, is busy with clandestine activities in Europe that could get her into very hot water.  In one way or another, all of these characters get involved with the deadly Chandonnes.<br />The problem with &quot;Blow Fly&quot; is that none of the plot elements coalesce.  The narrative does not flow and the characters do not engage the reader.  &quot;Blow Fly&quot; is little more than a dreary and depressing wallow in the misery that serial killers bring to the world.  The early Scarpetta books were rich with meaning and excitement.  How sad that Cornwell has to turn to old plot lines that no longer hold our interest when she could have shown Kay moving on with her life, meeting new people, and becoming engrossed in new and intriguing cases.	2003-11-02

Pi Patel is a teenager when, on June 21, 1977, he and his family set sail from India bound for Canada with a boatload of animals.  Pi's father sold the zoo that he owned in India, and he is bringing quite a few animals with him to Canada by cargo ship.  When the ship suddenly sinks, Pi finds himself adrift in the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  &quot;Life of Pi&quot; is the story of how Pi and Richard survive for 227 days under unspeakable conditions of cold, heat, thirst, and starvation.<br />Martel's prose is lyrical and vivid as he brings to life the feeling of being lost at sea with little hope of rescue.  The descriptive passages are outstanding.  The reader can feel the searing sun burning Pi's body and the maniacal rocking of the life raft during a sudden squall.  Some of the passages are brutal and gory, as Martel depicts the depths to which a living being will sink in order to survive.<br />&quot;Life of Pi&quot; can be understood and enjoyed on several levels. As a story of survival against overwhelming odds, it is a thrilling and suspenseful tale.  Pi shows great resourcefulness and courage when he tames the tiger, obtains food and water for both himself and Richard, protects his body from freezing cold and searing heat, and somehow retains his sanity throughout his terrible ordeal.  There are many humorous passages that make this otherwise grim tale a little easier to take, and Martel also sprinkles the book with some fascinating animal lore for the zoologically minded.<br />The book can also be interpreted as an allegory about how human beings approach the inevitable challenges that we all must face sooner or later. When we confront tragic losses and failures, do we wallow in self-pity and curse our bad luck?  Or do we make use of whatever resources we have to rebuild our lives anew?  Although Pi is very young, he is deeply religious and wise beyond his years.  He understands that &quot;you must take life the way it comes at you and make the best of it.&quot;  These are words that we would all do well to heed as we make our uncertain way through the obstacle course of life.t comes at you and make the best of it.&quot;  These are words that we would all do well to heed as we make our uncertain way through the obstacle course of life.	2003-10-27

Since Molly writes a weekly &quot;Crime Sheet&quot; column, she pays close attention to the assorted mischief and mayhem occurring in the Wilshire Division of Los Angeles.  Molly is a twenty-nine-year-old Orthodox Jew, one of seven children in the close-knit Blume family.  She is dating Zach, a local rabbi and former high-school boyfriend, but Molly is not sure that she is cut out to be a rabbi's wife.<br />Molly is also a free-lance reporter and an author of true crime books.  Therefore, she is very much attuned to any trouble that is brewing in her neck of the woods.  Molly has heard that local neighborhoods are being torn apart by a group called HARP, which stands for Historical Architectural Restoration and Preservation.  HARP groups are springing up in different areas of Los Angeles, and these groups prevent homeowners from remodeling their properties without prior approval.  As a result, vandals have started to target HARP board members and things are getting ugly.  When an old man, Oscar Linney, who had been vehemently in favor of HARP is murdered, Molly decides to investigate.  She also is curious about the fate of Linney's daughter, Margaret, who has been missing for months.<br />&quot;Dream House&quot; falls short in many areas.  The plot is way too complicated, with red herrings galore, and endless discussions about architecture that will bore anyone who has no interest in light fixtures, parquet floors, and French doors.  Molly Blume is a bit irritating.  She is always poking her nose into everyone else's business and she endlessly pumps people for information.  She also clashes with the local detectives who wish that she would keep her nose out of police business.  Molly Blume is too much like an Orthodox Nancy Drew.<br />At almost four hundred pages, the book is tedious and talky.  I have a problem with novels that consist mostly of the protagonist interviewing people.  In addition, the subplot about Molly's romance with Zach does not fit in comfortably with the rest of the book.  &quot;Dream House&quot; is, at best, an average mystery that is a little too bland for my taste.terviewing people.

In David Baldacci's new thriller, &quot;Split Second,&quot; Sean King and Michelle Maxwell are Secret Service agents who failed in their jobs to protect the presidential candidates entrusted to their care.  After he was drummed out of the Service, King started a new life in rural Virginia as a country lawyer and volunteer deputy. Maxwell is placed on administrative leave, and she decides to do some sleuthing of her own.  Soon, she begins to believe that her case and King's may be connected somehow.  Maxwell and King join forces to get to the bottom of the events that wrecked their careers.<br />Baldacci has stumbled badly with this novel.  The setup is intriguing enough.  Maxwell and King are two attractive and capable individuals who gain the reader's sympathy immediately.  However, before long, the plot slowly but surely unravels.  The novel ends up preposterously, and even the most gullible reader is forced to groan at the convoluted and irrational events that explain Maxwell's and King's downfall.<br />No one expects thrillers to be models of logic.  However, one would expect that a writer of Baldacci's stature would have enough respect for his loyal readership to come up with a story line that has some basis in reality.  In addition, at four hundred pages, &quot;Split Second&quot; is too long and lumbering. As appealing as the main characters are, they cannot make up for the unbelievable and far-fetched narrative that left me shaking my head in disbelief.	2003-10-20

The only good thing that I can say about &quot;Every Step You Take,&quot; the new thriller by Judith Kelman, is that the author had the germ of a good idea at the beginning of the novel.  The heroine, Claire Barrow, becomes a widow after her police officer husband, Noah, apparently takes his life.  It seems that Noah was despondent after being accused of witness tampering and obstructing justice while investigating an important case involving a vicious serial killer.<br />Claire's life subsequently goes from bad to worse.  Her teenaged stepdaughter, Rainey, becomes increasingly rebellious, and Claire, who is under contract to write a new novel, gets a new editor who resembles Attila the Hun. So far, so good.<br />Unfortunately, Kelman is not content to explore the themes of Noah's death, Claire's struggle to be a competent single parent, and her efforts to write a new novel.  The author brings in a host of other plotlines, including one about a scraggly dog that Claire takes in, another about the theft of Claire's identity, still another about a club of forensic experts who are looking into the same murders that Noah had been investigating, another about a disreputable boyfriend of Claire's stepdaughter, and yet another about an aunt who tries to civilize Rainey.<br />This book becomes increasingly busy until it reaches an ending that is so outlandish that it left me scratching my head in bewilderment.  I have nothing against surprise endings, as long as they flow logically from previous events.  That is not the case here.  &quot;Every Step You Take&quot; loses its way after a promising beginning and never recovers.	2003-10-20

Lynn Bartlett is a bright and beautiful immigration lawyer in her forties who embarked on her second marriage with great expectations. Her new husband, Jack Hughes, is a kind, loving, funny, and intelligent man. Unfortunately, when Lynn married Jack, she underestimated the problems that she would have with Jack's grasping ex-wife and his two spoiled adult children.<br />Catherine Todd, in her funny and entertaining new book, &quot;Secret Lives of Second Wives,&quot; explores the well-worn territory of how excess baggage from a first marriage sometimes drags a second marriage down. Todd's novel is not a rehash of old material, however. It is a refreshingly original story of a woman who is self-confident and comfortable in her own skin. Lynn is not willing to settle for second best either in her professional or her personal life. Her husband, laden with guilt about how he may have shortchanged his first family, incurs financial and psychological burdens that threaten to sabotage his relationship with Lynn.<br />Todd imbues Lynn's and Jack's story with a light and satirical touch. She takes amusing potshots at the materialistic and shallow lifestyle of certain Californians. The dialogue in &quot;Secret Lives&quot; is sharp and clever and the writing is crisp and fast-paced. Yet, underneath all of the lighthearted banter, there are serious undertones in this novel about the complexity of family relationships and the importance of commitment and compromise in a marriage. Catherine Todd's breezy prose style and her intelligent treatment of the dynamics of second marriages make &quot;Secret Lives of Second Wives&quot; a first-rate and very appealing contemporary novel.	2003-10-13

Ayelet Waldman, in a startling departure from her Mommy-Track Mysteries, has written a serious novel called &quot;Daughter's Keeper&quot;.  It is about a middle-aged woman named Elaine Goodman who owns her own pharmacy, lives with a man she loves, and is contentedly looking forward to a restful retirement.<br />Elaine's happiness would be complete were it not for her contentious daughter, Olivia.  Olivia is a college dropout and a political activist.  She was jailed briefly on several occasions for participating in various protests, and she works as a waitress to support herself and her boyfriend, Jorge, an illegal immigrant.  Olivia never knew her father, and her relationship with her mother has always been thorny.<br />This uneasy mother-daughter relationship is tested when Olivia faces a series of legal and personal crises that threaten to destroy her future. Suddenly, Elaine must make some tough decisions.  Should she concentrate on keeping her own life on track, or should she sacrifice her plans to help Olivia?<br />Waldman slowly and deliberately sets up her story and she fleshes out her characters carefully.  We get to know Elaine as a person who has suffered and struggled to get where she is, and who admits that mothering Olivia has never been easy for her.  Olivia is a caring and compassionate individual who is too brash, naive, and impulsive for her own good.  A particularly fascinating character in this novel is Izaya Feingold-Upchurch, a passionate defense attorney who helps Olivia when she gets into serious legal trouble.<br />Waldman explores many themes in &quot;Daughter's Keeper&quot;.  How much do we owe our children, especially when they reach their twenties and act irresponsibly?  What is the statute of limitations for parents when it comes to rescuing their adult children?  While telling the story of Elaine and Olivia Goodman, Waldman also discusses the legal and social ramifications of the often unfair and draconian federal mandatory minimum sentencing laws. This part of the book is both instructive and extremely disturbing.<br />&quot;Daughter's Keeper&quot; is a beautifully written and heartrending account of one family's wrenching journey towards understanding and reconciliation.

Corso is wanted in Texas as a material witness, and he decides to lie low until the warrant for his arrest expires.  Along with his former lover, photojournalist Meg Dougherty, Frank gets into an accident on a Wisconsin highway during a heavy blizzard.  When Dougherty and Corso take shelter in an abandoned house, they discover the grisly remains of a murdered family.<br />Corso is manipulated by the local sheriff into investigating this crime, which leads him to several states in his pursuit of a very unusual serial killer.  &quot;A Blind Eye&quot; explores the pathological side of human nature, especially the way in which horribly abused children sometimes grow into deeply disturbed and violent adults.<br />Corso is a terrific character.  He is strong, courageous, and eerily intuitive, and his girlfriend, Meg Dougherty, is gutsy and tenacious.  The secondary characters are also well-drawn. G. M. Ford's plot is intricate and engrossing, and he ratchets up the tension to an agonizing level prior to the hair-raising and electrifying finale.  &quot;A Blind Eye&quot; is a powerful and unsettling thriller that may give you nightmares.	2003-10-13

If you decide to read Dennis Lehane's \\"Mystic River,\\" be sure that you have no pressing appointments.  I stayed up late into the night finishing this nearly five-hundred-page novel.  Lehane tells a story so compelling that I blocked out my surroundings and was completely drawn into the the author's fictional world.<br />\\"Mystic River\\" takes place on the mean streets of Boston.  It starts in 1975 with three eleven-year-old boys named Sean Devine, Jimmy Marcus, and Dave Boyle, who occasionally hang out together.  Suddenly, a terrible event occurs that marks one of the boys for life and that will have far-reaching consequences for all of them.<br />Lehane fast-forwards to the year 2000.  The three boys are now men, and one of them, Sean Devine, is a homicide detective.  When a young woman is brutally murdered, Devine investigates the crime, and once again, the lives of the three boyhood friends intersect under tragic circumstances.<br />Lehane masterfully crafts every character in this book.  We get to know Jimmy Marcus as a volatile individual, a loose cannon who loves and hates with equal intensity.  Dave Boyle is a wounded and vulnerable man, as brittle as glass.  Sean is a lonely and arrogant workaholic.  All of the secondary characters, including the men's wives and children, are also well-drawn.  In \\"Mystic River,\\" Lehane explores the dark side of people's psyches that they rarely show to the outside world.  The civilized facade that some people present to their friends and neighbors may mask deep and poisonous feelings. When provoked, a person who seems perfectly ordinary and sane may suddenly turn into a monster.<br />This novel is also noteworthy for Lehane's meticulous and atmospheric description of the Irish-American neighborhoods where the action takes place.  He constructs the intricate plot expertly and consistently maintains a high level of suspense.  I recommend  \\"Mystic River\\" unreservedly.  It is a shattering and unforgettable reading experience.	2003-10-07

FBI agent Puller Monk, the Washington-based protagonist of Gene Riehl's thriller, &quot;Quantico Rules,&quot; has been around the block a few times.  He has worked both in the field and behind a desk, and he knows how the system works.  He also knows how to work outside of the system when necessary. Monk's latest and most urgent assignment is to dig out background information about a Supreme Court nominee.  With the help of his beautiful assistant, Lisa Sands, Monk discovers that the nominee may have some embarrassing skeletons in her closet.  Furthermore, there are some powerful people who are willing to kill to make sure that these skeletons remain hidden.<br />Monk is an intriguing character.  He is an excellent agent, but his personal life is a mess.  He is a compulsive gambler who bets money that he cannot afford to lose, and he harbors a bitter grudge against his elderly father who abused him as a child.  In addition, Monk's love life is nothing to write home about.  However, his biggest concerns are keeping his job and staying alive, not necessarily in that order.<br />Riehl, a former FBI agent himself, knows this territory well, and he provides fascinating information about the history and culture of the FBI.  I loved the details about the sophisticated gadgetry that agents use these days to catch the bad guys.  The only downside is that, as often happens in thrillers of this type, the villains are nasty stereotypes instead of real people.  Overall, however, &quot;Quantico Rules&quot; is entertaining, action-packed, and well worth your time.	2003-10-07

It is a clever, satirical, and intelligent look at why new recruits join the CIA and what happens to them after they sign up.  The heroine of \\"Loose Lips\\" is Selena Keller, an academic who holds a doctorate in Oriental Studies but has no promising job prospects on the horizon.  While surfing the Internet, she sees an ad for CIA trainees and she decides to respond.<br />Selena, along with a motley crew of other recruits, has no idea what she is getting into.  She will be mentally and physically tested in ways that she could never have anticipated.  Along the way, she finds love, learns how to lie expertly, and begins to realize that being part of the CIA may require her to sell her soul.<br />Berlinski pulls off a difficult feat.  She takes a serious subject, namely what the CIA means to America and how a person trains to be a CIA agent, and makes it entertaining.  \\"Loose Lips\\" is hilarious, incisive, psychologically astute, thought-provoking, and completely satisfying.

Gale is desperately trying to track down a villain named Adalwolf, who assisted the infamous Dr. Mengele in Auschwitz.  Adalwolf is now a seventy-five year old man, but he has not slowed down either physically or mentally.  The unrepentant Nazi is an expert in biology, genetics, and virology, and he hopes to use his formidable knowledge to create a virus that will destroy his enemies.<br />The first half of \\"The Last Nazi\\" is intriguing, suspenseful, and full of surprises.  Together with a SWAT team, Melissa closes in on a rooming house in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where Adalwolf supposedly lives.  Will Melissa's desperate effort to capture Adalwolf finally succeed?  Or has her cunning adversary once again outsmarted her?<br />The beginning of the novel has thrills, chills, and many surprises.  Unfortunately, the second half of the book goes downhill, as the author substitutes formulaic melodrama for genuine suspense.  Stan Pottinger's many twists, turns, and complications dilute his story's effectiveness.  If the author had expended more effort on humanizing his characters and on making his plot a bit more realistic, \\"The Last Nazi\\" would have had far greater impact.	2003-09-29

Marlene is suffering from depression and guilt over a series of violent actions that she committed in the past.  She is living apart from her family while she sorts out her feelings.<br />&quot;Resolved&quot; has a large cast of villains, including the sadistic and brutal Felix Tighe, a convicted felon with a grudge against the Karp family.  Joining Felix is a bunch of radical fundamentalists with explosives, lots of cash, and violent plans.  In other subplots, Butch helps prosecute two cops who may have killed an innocent man in cold blood, and Marlene tries to help out an old friend who is in serious legal trouble.  As he has done in the past, Tanenbaum expertly explores the moral dilemmas and political machinations that plague New York City's criminal justice system.<br />Tanenbaum's strengths have always been his witty and amusing dialogue, his marvelously colorful characters, and his insider's knowledge of  New York City's criminal courts.  Readers who have read all of the installments in this series have seen the Karp marriage evolve throughout the years, and they have also seen the Karp children grow up.  Lucy Karp, Butch and Marlene's fascinating and brilliant daughter, has a key role in this novel.<br />The story in &quot;Resolved&quot; is compelling, timely, and fast-paced.  Although the ending is not quite as strong as the rest of the book, &quot;Resolved&quot; is still an engrossing thriller that Tanenbaum fans will find as entertaining as its predecessors.	2003-09-25

Asahel hates her father and everything that he stands for.  In the past, she was an activist who protested the exploitation of native tribes, and although she works for her father, her heart is not in her job.

Jake and Asahel meet in the Amazon, and they join forces to get to the bottom of a terrible conspiracy which threatens the lives of many innocent people.<br />Through her characters, April Christofferson repeatedly lectures her readers on the evils of exploiting indigenous tribes.  The villains in &quot;Patent to Kill&quot; are caricatures whom the author depicts without a hint of subtlety.

Bell's sharp powers of observation and clever methods of detection were an inspiration for Doyle's fictional character, Sherlock Holmes.<br />It is the late 1800's in Edinburgh, Scotland. Arthur Doyle and Dr. Joseph Bell combine their resources to investigate a series of grisly assaults on women.  Ultimately, Bell fears that the assaults are the work of an unhinged individual whose crimes may soon escalate to murder.  It turns out that Bell's fears are well founded.  Their antagonist is a sadist who has tremendous intelligence, imagination, cruelty, and daring.<br />With his skilled description and vivid characterizations, Pirie has done a marvelous job of capturing the mood of the times.  He tackles several feminist themes, including the discrimination that faced young ladies who wished to attend medical school, and the wretched exploitation of impoverished women who sold their virtue in order to survive.<br />The characters of Bell and Doyle and sharp and well-drawn.  Bell's incisive mind, no-nonsense approach, and tenacity when faced with a difficult problem are indeed reminiscent of the great Sherlock Holmes. The central villain of the piece is a vile individual who will make your blood run cold.<br />Pirie includes several intriguing subplots, including one about a chauvinistic and cruel husband and another about an arrogant scientist who believes that the ends of scientific discovery justify unethical means. &quot;The Night Calls&quot; is a chilling, fascinating, and expertly written novel, and I recommend it highly.	2003-09-21

In &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; Jane Austen creates an entire universe out of the circumscribed world of genteel British society.  The main focus of the novel is the Bennet family, consisting of a nervous and silly mother, her indolent and sarcastic husband, and their five daughters.  Mrs. Bennet desperately wants her daughters to marry wealthy men, especially since Mr. Bennet's property will go to a male cousin, Mr. Collins, upon Mr. Bennet's death.<br />Soon, a likely marriage prospect appears in the person of Mr. Bingley, who rents a nearby home in Netherfield Park.  Mrs. Bennet  hounds her husband to call on Mr. Bingley immediately so that the Bennets can make his acquaintance.  To Mrs. Bennet's delight, Mr. Bingley proves to be a perfectly amiable and wealthy gentleman.  However, his close friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is quite the opposite of Bingley.  Darcy is a man whose arrogance and cold demeanor make him immediately unpopular with the Bennets, especially with Elizabeth Bennet, one of the daughters whom he particularly insults.<br />&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; deals with the preconceived notions that people have about one another and how these ideas wreak havoc with relationships.  Austen also casts her astute eye on the social mores of the time which made both men and women slaves to convention.  Marriage was not just a pleasant state for a woman.  It was a necessity, especially if her family lacked the means to support her for the rest of her life.<br />One of the most noteworthy aspects of this novel is Austen's lively cast of characters.  Elizabeth Bennet is surely one of the most vivacious, witty, and entrancing heroines in British fiction, and she meets her match in the dashing, proud, and inscrutable Mr. Darcy.  Austen's portraits of the stuffy and pompous Mr. Collins and his overbearing and opinionated patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, are hilarious.<br />Austen's novel is a high-class soap opera in many respects, with a myriad of romantic entanglements and much intrigue to keep the reader engrossed.  However, it is much more than that.

Christopher's father orders his son in the strictest terms not to stick his nose into other people's affairs.  However, Christopher ignores his father's orders and his investigation leads him down some unexpected paths.<br />Haddon's book is a brilliant journey into a world that few people can even contemplate.  What must it be like to have a literal mind that can process only certain types of arcane information but is powerless to handle the everyday social interactions that we all take for granted?  Haddon, who has worked with autistic individuals, has deep compassion for Christopher.  By writing this book from Christopher's point of view, the author enables the reader to feel this boy's confusion, anger, and heartbreak as his life begins to unravel.  Haddon not only lifts the curtain on an autistic's boy's world, but he also explores the strain that having such a child places on his parents.<br />&quot;The Curious Incident&quot; is eloquent, poignant, darkly humorous, and unforgettable.  I predict that this book will become a classic and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the intricate workings of the human mind and heart.	2003-09-14

They are divorced and have a daughter, Grace, whom they both adore. Although they still care for one another, Mike and Rosie get along better as law partners than they do as husband and wife. In Sheldon Siegel's new novel, \\"Final Verdict,\\" Rosie and Mike decide to take on a murder case that is all but hopeless.<br />The accused is Leon Walker, who was once a promising basketball star with a bright future.  Leon's life has spiraled downward, and he is now dying of liver disease. Leon calls Mike after being arrested for allegedly murdering a wealthy venture capitalist named Tower Grayson. The prosecutor has a slam-dunk case against Leon, and Mike knows that he has almost no chance of vindicating Walker before he dies. However, Mike and Rosie decide to do what they can to help Leon clear his name.<br />Mike and Rosie are wonderful characters. They are brilliant, witty, compassionate, and tenacious. While Rosie is the voice of reason and practicality, Mike, who used to be a priest, tends to get personally involved with his clients. Helping Rosie and Mike in their investigation is Pete, Mike's brother, and assorted other colorful types, including Nick Hanson, an amusing octogenarian who commands large fees for his considerable skills. Also noteworthy is Jerry Edwards, a nasty and aggressive reporter with an acid pen.<br />Although the mystery in \\"Final Verdict\\" is run-of-the-mill, the characters and the dialogue in this novel are top notch. Siegel has a crisp, vivid, and fast-paced writing style that is always entertaining. If you are a fan of legal thrillers, you will enjoy \\"Final Verdict.\\"	2003-09-07

Ruchama King's first novel, \\"Seven Blessings,\\" is set in Jerusalem. King explores the difficulties and heartaches that Orthodox Jewish men and women have when they seek a mate. Since no potential husband or wife is perfect, how much imperfection is acceptable? Should physical attraction be the main thing? If there is no chemistry on the first date, should a couple go out again? As if matters of the heart aren't complicated enough, the matchmaker has plenty of headaches putting up with demanding clients for whom no potential mate is good enough.<br />One lonely woman seeking a husband is Beth, who is in her late thirties. She is introduced to an attractive man named Akiva, a kind and intelligent person who suffers from an uncontrollable and alarming spasm that comes and goes. Beth does not think that she is emotionally strong enough to accept Akiva's physical problem. Another single individual is the narcissistic and immature Binyamin, a talented artist and yeshiva student who has become cynical about the dating game. He wants a woman who is good-natured, graceful, and strikingly beautiful. None of the many women whom Binyamin has dated measures up to his high standards.<br />King explores not only the problems that plague relationships between men and women, but she also describes her characters' spiritual struggles. Although the people in this book want to live religious lives, they sometimes find themselves riddled with doubts about who they are and where they belong in the world.<br />King nicely describes the beauty and holiness of Jerusalem, and she captures the nuances of her characters' quirky personalities. The second half of the book is not as strong as the first, since King's writing ultimately veers a little too far from reality and becomes overly fanciful. Still, \\"Seven Blessings\\" is an intriguing and engrossing novel from a talented and promising new author.	2003-09-05

Martha Grimes's new book, \\"Foul Matter,\\" is a funny and off-beat treatment of the corrupt, venal, and nasty side of the publishing industry. Paul Giverney is a best-selling author who can write his own ticket. He decides to change publishers, and he agrees to sign on with a house named Mackenzie-Haack on the condition that they drop a talented writer named Ned Isaly. Ned loves his craft and his characters live vividly in his head. He cares little about wealth and adulation. In short, he is the exact opposite of many of today's high-priced authors. Critics love Ned, but, alas, he does not command big publicity tours and his books are not displayed in the front window of major bookselling chains.<br />Paul Giverney negotiates a deal with an ambitious Mackenzie-Haack editor named Clive Esterhaus, who knows that getting Giverney would be a major coup for his publishing house and for him personally. Esterhaus's boss, Bobby Mackenzie, has no scruples about doing whatever it takes to get this hot author. He can actually see the dollar signs dancing in front of his eyes. To what lengths will Bobby go to get Giverney? How will Bobby get rid of Ned, who is under contract?<br />Grimes must know some reprehensible and unscrupulous publishing types, because her book is a scathing indictment of the business. Although the author is a bit heavy-handed in her distaste for the sordid aspects of publishing, she makes up for it with her deliciously deadpan humor and her amusingly eccentric characters. The two funniest individuals in the book are Karl and Candy, hit men with a conscience and an appreciation for a good book.<br />There is a farcical interlude in which Ned Isaly travels to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and a virtual posse of his friends, acquaintances, and the omnipresent hit men follow him. Although everyone is trying to be incognito, all of these characters practically fall over one another. Grimes's wacky and whimsical sense of humor makes \\"Foul Matter\\" delightfully entertaining.ertaining.	2003-09-04

Tess Gerritsen's excellent new suspense thriller, \\"The Sinner,\\" is her best work in years. Boston-based medical examiner Maura Isles and Detective Jane Rizzoli are called in to investigate a brutal attack on two nuns who live in a cloistered convent. Was this a random attack by an intruder, or were the nuns the intended targets? Isles and Rizzoli also investigate the case of a murdered woman whose mutilated body turns up in an abandoned building.  The corpse's physical condition suggests that the woman had suffered from a mysterious and debilitating disease.  What is the disease and is it somehow related to her death?<br />Maura and Jane have some personal problems in addition to their professional worries.  Suddenly and inexplicably, Maura's ex-husband, Victor Banks, turns up in Boston. Although she has not seen him in years, Maura is still attracted to Victor. However, she is wondering why he has suddenly come back into her life, and she suspects that he may be manipulating her for reasons of his own. Jane Rizzoli, a hard-bitten cop who tries to hide her personal feelings, is still in turmoil over her brief affair with an FBI agent named Gabriel Dean. Gerritsen's protagonists, Isles and Rizzoli, are strong and professional women, but they are also vulnerable, sensitive, and fallible. We care very much what happens to them.<br />With her crisp and deft prose style, Gerritsen successfully combines the elements of a medical thriller, murder mystery, and romance in \\"The Sinner.\\" The action, dialogue, and character development are all first rate, and the plot is intricate without being convoluted. To her credit, Gerritsen brings all of the novel's threads together in a satisfying conclusion that feels just right.  Don't miss this top-notch thriller.	2003-08-31

Dr. David Tennant is a physicist, a doctor, and a professor of ethics.  Therefore, Tennant is the perfect person to oversee the moral dilemmas posed by a new and groundbreaking scientific project known as Trinity. A team of brilliant scientists is attempting to build a supercomputer that will have capabilities far exceeding that of the human mind.  The question is, do we want such a computer, and is there a danger that this technology could be used for evil purposes?<br />Tennant is horrified when his colleague, Dr. Andrew Fielding, is found dead under mysterious circumstances.  Tennant suspects that Fielding may have been murdered because he expressed serious reservations about the wisdom of proceeding with Project Trinity.  Soon, Tennant realizes that his own life may be in danger and he takes to the road to elude the assassins that are on his trail.  Accompanying Tennant is Rachel Weiss, his psychiatrist and friend.<br />\\"The Footprints of God\\" does not work on any level.  Its villains are stock characters, including the arrogant Peter Godin, who conceived of Trinity and had the money and clout to make it happen, and Geli Bauer, a vicious and dangerous woman who oversees security for the project.  Tennant and Weiss are paper-thin characters who have little to do except elude their pursuers.<br />At over four hundred and fifty pages, \\"The Footprints of God\\" is very repetitious, with numerous chase scenes and pedantic speeches about the power of science versus the legitimate needs of humanity.  The ending is a series of action sequences that generate more confusion than suspense.  There is also a subplot about Tennant's mystical visions, during which he explores the mysteries of the universe and even inhabits the body of Jesus.  \\"The Footprints of God\\" suffers from wooden dialogue, a labored and overly complicated plot, and characters that never come to life.

After his release from prison, St. Bride comes to the small town of Salem Falls to start a new life.<br />St. Bride takes a job as a dishwasher in a diner, where he falls in love with the owner, Addie Peabody, another tortured and lonely soul.  Can Jack and Addie look forward to a bright future together and at last escape the demons of the past? Alas, Jack's tragic history follows him to Salem Falls, threatening to bring him down once again.<br />Picoult's novel is a lively mix of intrigue, courtroom drama, and romance.  Picoult brings her characters to life, including the intelligent but unlucky Jack St. Bride, the tough but warm Addie Peabody, and the manipulative and scheming Gillian Duncan, a teenager who wants to hammer the final nail into Jack's coffin.  There are many subplots along the way, as well as a number of flashbacks.  There are so many secrets and revelations in &quot;Salem Falls&quot; that it begins to resemble &quot;Peyton Place.&quot; Unfortunately, all of this weight ultimately drags the book down.<br />In addition, Picoult inserts unsubtle references to the Salem witch trials and Arthur Miller's &quot;The Crucible,&quot; making her point that too often, people hastily condemn others on the basis of rumor, innuendo and unfounded allegations.<br />In spite of its occasional heavy-handedness, &quot;Salem Falls&quot; is an engrossing page-turner.  You will care about the characters and you will be anxious to learn the ultimate fate of Jack St. Bride.	2003-08-18

In her magical new book, \\"Letters to a Young Therapist,\\" Mary Pipher uses enchanting and lyrical prose to express her feelings not only about therapy, but also about such topics as nature, marriage, ethics, and happiness.  This book is a compilation of letters that Pipher wrote to a graduate student in psychology.  Pipher's letters are filled with gentle humor and a profound understanding of human nature.<br />Since Pipher began her career as a therapist in 1972, she has learned a great deal about her clients and herself, and this book is the fruit of all that she has learned.  She emphasizes that therapy is more of an art than a science, and that therapists bear an enormous responsibility to treat their clients with great care.<br />Pipher's ideas are a breath of fresh air in a society that is quick to bash easy targets.  For instance, it is fashionable for people to blame their parents and other family members for their problems, but Pipher believes that individuals must ultimately take responsibility for their own choices in life.  She also believes that the family unit is so important that we should do everything in our power to support and strengthen it rather than undermine it.<br />Pipher waxes poetic when she speaks of the power of metaphor and storytelling to enhance people's lives and imbue their experiences with greater meaning.  Pipher is not only a gifted therapist.  She is also a talented writer who understands the power of language to change lives.  I recommend this book highly for its warmth, wisdom, compassion, and insight into what makes life worth living.	2003-08-17

The villain in Kate Wilhelm's new psychological thriller, \\"Clear and Convincing Proof,\\" is David McIvey, a brilliant surgeon who is cold and abrupt with his patients and condescending to his intimidated wife, Annie.  McIvey works in a nonprofit rehabilitation center, which he hopes to convert into a for-profit surgical center. This plan has angered those who want the rehab center to continue as a place of healing, even for those who cannot afford to pay.<br />When McIvey's corpse is found outside the rehab center, the police suspect Annie of killing her husband in collusion with Darren Halvord, a gifted physical therapist who once dated Annie.  Barbara Holloway, a criminal defense attorney, is retained to represent Annie and David.  With the help of her lawyer father and a shrewd private investigator, Holloway is determined to find out who really killed McIvey.<br />Wilhelm's writing style is workmanlike but formulaic.  David McIvey is a heavy-handed stereotype, a brute with brains who will stop at nothing to get his way.  Most of the other principals are stock characters, as well.  Holloway, however, is a smart investigator who has both chutzpah and imagination.  She is resourceful and tenacious in getting to the bottom of this puzzling case.  When Barbara and her equally engaging father take center stage, the book comes alive.  Although \\"Clear and Convincing Proof\\" features an average mystery, the Holloways make it worth reading.	2003-08-17

Who planted this deadly substance and why?  Clark exploits the nation's heightened interest in terrorism to make her plot more timely and compelling.<br />&quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; is a lively page-turner with very brief chapters, a brisk style, and no literary pretensions.  Clark skillfully sets up a host of decoy suspects to throw the reader off the scent of the elusive murderer.  This novel adheres to the standard thriller formula and breaks no new ground, but Clark effectively builds up suspense and holds the reader's interest.  &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; is good escapist entertainment.	2003-08-13

Elizabeth George overdoes it a bit in &quot;A Place of Hiding,&quot; her new novel featuring Simon and Deborah St. James.  Deborah's old friends China and Cherokee Rivers (I am not making up these names) are in a spot of trouble on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel.<br />China has been arrested for the murder of Guy Brouard, a womanizing millionaire, and Deborah refuses to believe that her old and dear friend could be capable of such a crime.  The passionate and emotional Deborah and her dispassionate forensic scientist husband, Simon, travel to Guernsey to start their own investigation into the crime.<br />At over five hundred pages, &quot;A Place of Hiding&quot; meanders along at a sluggish pace.  George hits the reader over the head with repetitious descriptions of Brouard's activities, of his ineffectual son, Adrian, and of his vicious and greedy ex-wives.  In addition, the book has so much going on that the reader needs a scorecard to keep track of the dozens of events that occur one after the other. George throws a number of red herrings into the mix in an apparent effort to keep the ending a surprise. A subplot about Deborah's and Simon's lack of communication does not generate much electricity and it serves to drag the book down even further.<br />There are too many characters and far too many twists and turns in this book.  A more focused and well-defined plot and more concisely and skillfully drawn characters would have helped make &quot;A Place of Hiding&quot; the compelling mystery that Ms. George meant it to be.	2003-08-10

Zoe Heller's new book \\"What Was She Thinking?\\" is the daring story of Sheba Hart, a middle-aged woman who embarks on a torrid love affair with her fifteen-year-old student, Steven Connolly.  Sheba is a married woman with two children, but her lust for Steven impels her to throw caution to the winds.  She convinces herself that she is in love with the boy and that he reciprocates her feelings.<br />Sheba's unhealthy obsession with Steven is matched by a fellow teacher's obsession with Sheba.  Barbara is a dowdy and solitary spinster who is much older than Sheba.  Aside from her cat, Portia, Barbara has no companions.  Her prickly personality has driven away the few friends that she has ever made.  She yearns for someone to love and care for, and she attaches herself to Sheba, soon becoming her close friend and confidante.<br />Heller is a literate, precise writer.  She has a sure ear for dialogue, a darkly comic touch, and a deep understanding of how perverse and irrational desperate people can be.  The characters in \\"What Was She Thinking?\\" are funny, tragic, pathetic, and agonizingly real.  We observe their misguided actions with horror, much as onlookers are mesmerized at the scene of a terrible car accident.  Heller wisely picks Barbara as the narrator.  Her recounting of Sheba's liaison with Steven and her description of the ebb and flow of her relationship with Sheba reveal as much about Barbara's demons as they do about Sheba's.  All of the characters in this novel are well drawn, from the pompous school principal to Sheba's prickly and insolent teenaged daughter. Heller has written a controversial and disturbing book about an unpleasant topic.  However, \\"What Was She Thinking?\\" is more than just a prurient tale of a love-starved teacher and her student.  It is a fascinating and engrossing study of compulsive people on a path to self-destruction.	2003-08-08

The protagonists in Dan Brown's best selling novel, \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" are Robert Langdon, a brilliant symbologist from Harvard and Sophie Neveu, a French cryptologist.  Sophie's grandfather, Jacques Sauniere, was brutally murdered in the Grand Gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris, where he was curator. The French police suspect that Langdon may be the killer, but Langdon flees after protesting his innocence.  He teams up with Sophie to decipher the clues that Sauniere left behind in the minutes before he died.  The two then embark on a difficult and dangerous search that leads them through France and London on the trail of the real killer.<br />\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is filled with complex puzzles and arcane facts about such subjects as the history of the Roman Catholic Church, Leonardo Da Vinci's genius, and the origins of such words as \\"villain\\" and \\"heretic\\".  If you like puzzles and obscure history as I do, then you may find these parts of the book intriguing.<br />However, Brown does not completely succeed in writing a great thriller.  The characters of Sophie and Robert are poorly developed.  We get no sense of them as human beings.  They are merely vehicles for the many set speeches that they make throughout the book, often along the lines of, \\"I've got it! Let me explain what this code means!\\"  The dialogue is stilted, the villains are stock characters, and the author overuses italics and exclamation points to show the reader that a very important event is occurring. On the plus side, Brown certainly piqued my interest with his fascinating and tantalizing codes and his unusual tale of a secret so earthshattering that it drives people to kill.	2003-08-03

In Lisa Gardner's sixth novel, \\"The Killing Hour,\\" the protagonist is Kimberly Quincy, a deeply troubled young woman who is following in her father's footsteps by training as a Special Agent for the FBI. Her male counterpart is Georgia-based Special Agent Mac McCormack, who is in Quantico to find a lead on a case that has troubled him for years.<br />Seven young women have died under Mac's watch, all victims of a sadistic serial killer. Mac is hoping that the FBI's expertise will help him crack the case. When Kimberly stumbles on the dead body of yet another victim, this time in Quantico, she and the hunky McCormack risk their careers when they team up to catch the killer. They have no jurisdiction in this case and they are told to keep their noses out of it. However, both Mac and Kimberly are driven to press on with their investigation.<br />Does all of this sound familiar? It should, since \\"The Killing Hour\\" is chock full of clich&eacute;s. First, there is the psychopathic but devilishly clever criminal who is driven to kill because of his childhood demons. Then, there are the two bright, motivated, and good-looking agents, Kimberly and Mac, who risk everything to see that justice is done. Will they be able to resist the undeniable physical attraction that they have for one another? Finally, there is the race against time to try to save at least one of the killer's victims.<br />To Gardner's credit, she moves the plot along briskly enough and she writes exciting action sequences. Gardner has done her homework and the details about the FBI and investigative procedure seem authentic. Kimberly and Mac are sympathetic characters, and the author sustains a high level of tension throughout most of the book. \\"The Killing Hour\\" is, on the whole, a mildly entertaining thriller and I give it a marginal recommendation.	2003-08-03

Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis is well known for her outreach, lectures, and popular newspaper column.  She is also the author of \\"The Committed Life,\\" in which she wrote about the spiritual rewards of living according to the precepts of the Torah.  In her latest book, \\"The Committed Marriage,\\"  Rebbetizin Jungreis convincingly shows that a man and woman whose marriage is faltering may be able to revitalize their relationship.<br /><br />Jungreis avoids lecturing us.  She presents many pertinent and interesting anecdotes that demonstrate the importance of treating your partner with respect, communicating with him or her effectively, and persevering when the going gets tough.  The reason that Jungreis's words do not come across as didactic and condescending is that she infuses her advice with love, compassion, and deep psychological understanding. Jungreis's beautiful writing style flows smoothly and effortlessly.  Her warmth and concern shine through and embrace the reader.  The book is enhanced by Rebbetzin Jungreis's frequent and personal allusions to the words and actions of her late father and husband, since these two spiritual giants exemplified the purest Torah values.<br /><br />Cynics may dismiss the ideas brought forth in \\"The Committed Marriage\\" as simple common sense.  Unfortunately, common sense is increasingly uncommon these days.  In our \\"me first\\" society, too many individuals hide behind their busy schedules and neglect the most important people in their lives.  I recommend \\"The Committed Marriage\\" for those who want to have a more meaningful, harmonious, and joyous marriage.	2003-07-29

Hollis is mortified when her long-long husband, an irresponsible drifter who plays piano in lounges, shows up at his daughter's house to recuperate from a freak accident.  Hollis has no desire to live with her despised husband under one roof.<br />Jeanne Ray takes all of these ingredients and mixes them up into a delicious souffle.  The comic exchanges between the characters are priceless. Ray beautifully depicts how the members of this family slowly begin to look at one another in a new light.  She demonstrates how we take our relatives for granted until we realize how precious and indispensable they really are.

The family was devastated when Rose's husband, Rufus Hasty, whom the family affectionately nicknamed &quot;The Zed,&quot; killed himself one day without even leaving a note.  Now the ladies are desperately seeking a way to retain their beloved ancestral home, Melismate, which has been in the family for generations.  Unfortunately, the Hasty family is almost penniless.  Two of the sisters come up with the idea of convincing rich men to fall in love with them, a scheme that they call &quot;The Marrying Game.&quot;<br />On this lighthearted note, the novel gets under way, and before too long, the Hasty women cast their spell.  Besides being utterly gorgeous young ladies, Rufa, Nancy, Selena, and Lydia are fascinating and charming individuals.  Saunders makes each character come brilliantly alive.  Rufa, who is an extraordinary chef, is the most vulnerable, since her father's death hit her the hardest.  Selena is bookish but rebellious.  Nancy is voluptuous and a bit wild.  Lydia has already endured a failed marriage and she is the mother of a precocious and adorable little girl named Linnet.<br />Saunders works her magic on many levels.  On the one hand, &quot;The Marrying Game&quot; is a comic bedroom farce, with various characters falling in and out of love constantly.  Saunders gets serious, however, when she describes the touching devotion of the Hasty sisters to one another.  In addition, Saunders sensitively explores the difficulty of carrying on after suffering the loss of a loved one.<br />Saunders has Jane Austen's psychological insight and attention to detail, Louisa May Alcott's understanding of family dynamics, and Elinor Lipman's zaniness and saucy irreverence.

Alice Thrift, a graduate of Harvard Medical School, is an unhappy intern in a Boston hospital. Her ineptitude with people is legendary. She says whatever pops into her head, no matter how inappropriate. This is not a good characteristic for a doctor, who is expected to be tactful with her patients. In addition, her romantic life has been on the back burner for years, while she works brutal hours in her pursuit of a career in medicine.<br />Alice lives platonically with her roommate, a male nurse named Leo Frawley. Leo is extremely popular with everyone and he is thoroughly at ease with himself, qualities which Alice sorely lacks. Suddenly, a new man enters Alice's life. Ray Russo, a chocolate fudge salesman, comes to Alice for a consultation, and it soon becomes apparent that Ray may have romantic designs on the harried intern. Will Ray bring Alice out of her shell at last? Will Alice learn to think before she speaks?<br />&quot;The Pursuit of Alice Thrift&quot; is a winner. The characters, dialogue, and plot are sharp and witty, and at times I laughed out loud at a particularly amusing line. What makes this book stand out is that the reader grows to care about Alice and roots for her to succeed both in medicine and in love. Lipman brings every character to hilarious life. These include Alice's frustrated parents, her cynical friend, Sylvie Schwartz, and her unctuous and opportunistic boyfriend, Ray Russo.<br />&quot;The Pursuit of Alice Thrift&quot; is one of Elinor Lipman's best. From the first page to the last, it is fast-paced, brisk, sophisticated, sexy, and thoroughly entertaining.	2003-07-21

Dr. Tempe Brennan is a forensic anthropologist and part-time sleuth whose knowledge of human and animal remains helps her solve difficult cases.<br />This time around, Tempe becomes embroiled in a complicated investigation that includes a possible infanticide, illegal trafficking in endangered species and drug running. As a sidebar, Tempe's romance with Andrew Ryan, the hunky Canadian detective whom she has coveted in the past, is finally heating up. Tempe is as nervous as a schoolgirl about the future of this relationship.<br />On every level, \\"Bare Bones\\" is unsuccessful. The cast of characters is lengthy and confusing, and the plot meanders along pointlessly throughout much of the book. It took perseverance for me to wade through this tedious novel, and by the time I got to the end, I was well beyond caring who did what to whom.<br />To make matters worse, Reichs's dialogue is too often preachy or cutesy. She also has an unfortunate habit of overusing italics and exclamation points to indicate that Tempe is stressed out or in danger. I recommend that you skip \\"Bare Bones,\\" since it is far less entertaining than the previous five novels in this series.	2003-07-20

In Sue Fishkoff's book, \\"The Rebbe's Army,\\" the reader gets an insider's look at the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, which derives its strength from the wisdom and teachings of the last Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.  For forty-three years, until his death in 1994, the Rebbe was the heart and soul of Chabad, and even after his death, he is still a tremendous source of inspiration for his many followers.<br />Chabad is not just a movement; it is a worldwide organization. Thousands of married couples act as emissaries throughout the United States and in sixty-one foreign countries. Their mission is to rekindle the spark of Judaism that they believe is present in all Jews.  Fishkoff points out the apparent contradiction of Chasidic Jews who adhere to strict observance of Torah law, but who, nevertheless, seek out and live among non-observant Jews. This means that some couples, such as the emissaries who live in Thailand, are largely cut off from the support system of friends and family.  Once a couple takes a position as emissaries in a foreign country, they are generally there for life.<br />Although Fishkoff gives a brief background of how the Lubavitcher movement originated and grew, she concentrates mostly on emissaries in various parts of the United States, including Alaska.  Fishkoff depicts the Chabad organizers as a savvy bunch.  They are psychologically astute, great communicators and superb fundraisers.  She also touches on how Chabad has used Hollywood celebrities to raise money and awareness.  Although, in her preface, Fishkoff claims that she will not discuss Chabad's political strength, she includes a chapter explaining how the Lubavitcher Chasidim have become involved in Washington politics.  They have become a force to be reckoned with on the national as well as the local political scene.<br />Fishkoff tries to be evenhanded by pointing out the controversies surrounding the Chabad movement. Some Jewish organizations have felt that the Chabad emissaries who move into their towns are too aggressive. A more serious controversy surrounds the belief, still held by many Chasidim, that the Rebbe is the Messiah.  Some Jews feel that this is idolatrous and that such talk has no place in Orthodox Judaism.  These disputes have engendered rifts among Chasidim and have tarnished the image of Chabad in the Jewish community at large.<br />I recommend this book for readers who are curious about what makes Chabad tick.  Many questions will be answered in these pages.  I must warn the reader that Fishkoff tends to be a little long-winded and repetitious at times, and this slows the narrative down a bit.  However, most readers will be inspired by the spiritual strength of the Chabad outreach workers and emissaries. These are people who are willing to sacrifice their privacy and personal comfort for the satisfaction of helping others.  They are, in the words of the Rebbe, \\"bringing Heaven back down to earth.\\"aries who move into their towns are too aggressive.

In Anne Tyler's \\"A Patchwork Planet,\\" we meet thirty-year-old Barnaby Gaitlin, a man who has never fit into polite society. He was a juvenile delinquent as a boy.  He later married and divorced, and he has a daughter whom he sees now and then.  Barnaby has very little money, he dresses shabbily, and he lives in a rundown apartment.<br /><br />Barnaby works for \\"Rent-a-Back,\\" a company that specializes in doing odd jobs for elderly people who cannot manage by themselves.  Since his divorce, Barnaby has never seriously dated anyone.  However, one day he meets a genteel and proper woman named Sophia, and it appears that Barnaby may settle down at last. In many ways, Barnaby appears to be a consummate loser, but he connects deeply with his elderly clients and he always goes the extra mile for them.  Since he is an outsider himself, Barnaby understands people who no longer feel useful or wanted. In this novel, Anne Tyler shows an appreciation of and a deep compassion for those who live on the fringes of life.<br /><br />With rare eloquence, Tyler expresses the idea that there is a place on our \\"patchwork planet\\" for everyone, including those who are a little odd or slightly out of step.  How much better our world would be if we opened up our hearts to those people whom society has forgotten.  \\"A Patchwork Planet\\" is an original and engrossing look at life, love, death and loneliness.	2003-07-15

The hero of William Bernhardt's Ben Kincaid novels is a socially inept but legally astute Oklahoma criminal defense attorney.  Traditionally, a Ben Kincaid novel features a great deal of cutesy banter and coy behavior on the part of Ben and his wacky office staff.  There is still some of that in &quot;Death Row,&quot; but this book proves to be much more harrowing and serious than the usual Bernhardt fare.<br />The first chapter of &quot;Death Row&quot; is frightening and disturbing.  The reader is immediately plunged into an apparent home invasion in which a family is brutally tortured and murdered, with one survivor desperately trying to break free before she too is killed.  We then fast forward seven years later to the trial of Ray Goldman, who is convicted and sentenced to die for the killing of the aforementioned family.  Ben Kincaid is handling Goldman's case.  With the help of his good friend and law partner, Christina McCall, Ben desperately tries to postpone the execution so that he can find evidence that will exonerate his client.<br />There is an entertaining subplot featuring Major Mike Morelli, Ben's former brother-in-law.  Morelli is a homicide detective who is forced to pair up with a new partner, a woman who is as irritating as she is beautiful.  Morelli and his partner get embroiled in Ben's case when several women connected with the investigation are found dead, both apparent suicides.  Did these women really kill themselves or were they murdered?<br />The plot thickens as Ben, Mike and their colleagues dig deeper and deeper to get at the truth of what really happened seven years ago.  &quot;Death Row&quot; is an absorbing and hard-hitting thriller with many surprising twists and turns. The book is fast-paced and the humor is appropriately restrained considering the subject matter of the novel.  I do have one or two quibbles, however.  There are several coincidences in the book that make little sense.  In addition, as in his previous books, Bernhardt persists in having Ben and Christina relate emotionally to one another like lovesick teenagers.  It would be nice to see these two behave like mature adults.  Still &quot;Death Row&quot; is one of the best Ben Kincaid novels that Bernhardt has written in years and I recommend it.dt persists in having Ben and Christina relate emotionally to one another like lovesick teenagers.

Gage leaves behind broken families and vulnerable survivors who must find a way to put the past behind them and get on with their lives.  In Amy Gutman's new thriller, &quot;The Anniversary,&quot; three of the women who had crossed the killer's path receive threatening notes on the anniversary of the execution.<br />Gutman's heroines are striking characters.  One is a high-powered lawyer who worked on Gage's last appeal and lost.  The failed appeal upset her greatly and almost ruined her career.  Another woman was Steven Gage's girlfriend for years and it was her testimony that convicted Gage.  She feels guilty for not seeing the signs of her boyfriend's criminal activities and putting a stop to his killing spree.<br />Amy Gutman has written a tense and suspenseful novel with plenty of red herrings to keep the reader off balance. Although it is slightly weakened by some unrealistic touches, &quot;The Anniversary&quot; is still a frightening and thoroughly engrossing thriller that will keep you guessing until the end.	2003-07-13

Barbara LaSalle's honest and painfully graphic book, &quot;Finding Ben,&quot; hits you between the eyes with its depiction of a family in turmoil.  Barbara's son, Ben, seems to be a gifted child, perhaps even a genius.  From an early age his reading ability is astounding.  He speaks like a little adult.  Ben's recall of specific knowledge is incredible and he can mimic any commercial that he hears on television or on the radio word for word.<br />In spite of his remarkable intellectual prowess, Ben has some very serious problems.  He is unable to make friends.  He is uncoordinated and hopeless at sports or any other kind of physical activity.  He feels like a freak and his peers treat him like one.  Barbara and her husband make every effort to get help for Ben.  They go from one specialist to another and they hire various therapists to work with Ben, but he does not get any better.  Will Ben's parents ever find out what is wrong with him and can he ever be like other kids?<br />LaSalle is perfectly frank about what she considers to be her shortcomings as a mother.  Although it is obvious that she cares very much for Ben, for a long time she is unable to accept him as he is.  LaSalle blames herself for not being a model of patience and tolerance.  She also effectively depicts the emotional strain that having a special needs child places on a marriage.<br />&quot;Finding Ben&quot; is for all parents of physically and emotionally challenged children and for anyone who wants to know what it is like to live with such a child.  LaSalle's book is also a cautionary tale, warning parents that even people with fancy degrees and titles after their names can misdiagnose a patient.  Never stop being an advocate for your child, warns LaSalle, since you are his greatest champion.  &quot;Finding Ben&quot; is a poignant, informative, funny, tragic and hopeful book.	2003-07-10

Clare Francis specializes in dysfunctional families with disturbing secrets.  In &quot;A Dark Devotion,&quot; Grace Dearden, a young wife and mother who lives in Norfolk, England, suddenly disappears.  Alex O'Neill, an attorney and an old friend of Grace's husband, Will, steps in to help.  Alex's services are needed, since the police suspect that Will may have had something to do with Grace's disappearance.  Alex begins an investigation of her own, hoping to find out what really happened to Grace.<br />Alex's interest in the case is not entirely professional.  Her marriage is shaky, since her husband, Paul, is a drunk who is deeply involved with some disreputable characters.  Alex still has feelings for Will, whom she loved when she was a young girl.  As she delves into the complexities of this case, Alex begins to uncover the truth behind the Dearden family façade.<br />Frances sets up her story well, and she populates &quot;A Dark Devotion&quot; with intriguing characters.  Alex is a smart, compassionate and tenacious lawyer, whose experience with the criminal justice system makes her a valuable ally.  Although Alex cares for Will, she tries not to allow her emotions to color her perceptions.  Other notable characters are Alex's weak-willed and shallow brother, Edward, Will's fragile mother, Maggie, and his vulnerable little boy, Charlie.  Francis makes us care about these people and we are eager to find out how things went so dreadfully wrong for this &quot;picture perfect&quot; family.<br />The book is weakest at the end, when startling revelations come one after another.  Francis, like so many authors in this genre, wants to surprise the reader with twists and turns, but she lays on the contrivances and the melodrama too thickly.  Still, most of &quot;A Dark Devotion&quot; is a literate and engrossing novel that will have you turning pages quickly to see how the mystery is resolved.	2003-07-08

In 1970, a respected army physician named Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald claimed that four strangers broke into his home in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and killed his wife and two daughters. Although an army tribunal tried Dr. MacDonald and cleared him, years later the case was reopened.  This time, MacDonald was convicted and sent to prison. Janet Malcolm does not retry the MacDonald case in her book, \\"The Journalist and the Murderer.\\" Rather, she examines the issues behind a lawsuit that MacDonald brought in 1984 against his supposed friend, Joe McGinnis, author of \\"Fatal Vision.\\" Joe McGinniss posed as an ally of Jeffrey MacDonald for years. McGinnis lived with MacDonald for a while and even joined his defense team. McGinniss sent MacDonald sympathetic letters in support of his cause.  In these letters, he frequently expressed his support for MacDonald.<br /><br />It was only after \\"Fatal Vision\\" was published that MacDonald discovered the truth. McGinniss did not believe in MacDonald's innocence; on the contrary, he portrays MacDonald as a psychopathic murderer. The author posed as a friend for the sole purpose of keeping MacDonald in the dark so that McGinniss would continue to have access to his subject. \\"Fatal Vision\\" became a huge bestseller and eventually became a miniseries. Malcolm's book, written in 1990, takes on added significance in 2003, when the ethics of journalists are under fire. Some have been accused of plagiarizing and fabricating stories. The public is beginning to recongnize that reporters are fallible and suffer from the same pressures, ambitions, and psychological disorders as other ordinary mortals.<br /><br />This is not merely a condemnation of McGinniss's behavior towards MacDonald. Malcolm's premise is that the journalist's relationship to his subject is, in its very essence, a perilous one. The gullible subject babbles away to his \\"sympathetic\\" listener, revealing more of himself than he realizes.  When all is said and done, only the journalist and his editors have control over the final product.  They are sometimes tempted to distort the facts to make the piece more interesting. Malcolm asserts that certain journalists are con men who prey on people's loneliness, credibility, and narcissism to get a good story. Journalists have their own agendas and the \\"truth,\\" which is elusive at best, is not always their top priority. Malcolm's book is a warning not to believe everything that is printed in a newspaper or a magazine, since each story is only one version of reality.st and his editors have control over the final product.

Precious Ramotswe is the thirty-something protagonist of Alexander McCall Smith's successful series about a lady detective in Botswana. The first book of the series is \\"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,\\" in which Smith gives the back story of how Ramotswe came to be the first female detective in Botswana.<br />Mma Ramotswe, as she is known throughout the book, is the only child of Obed Ramotswe, whom she idolizes. Since her mother died when she was young, Mma Ramotswe learned about life from her father. Obed owned a big herd of cattle, which his daughter inherited upon her father's death. She uses the proceeds from the sale of her father's cattle to buy a house on Zebra Drive and set up her detective agency.<br />Using lyrical prose, Smith does a brilliant job of imbuing his book with the ambiance of Botswana. We see the thorn and acacia trees on the horizon, we marvel at the colorful birds as they swoop down from the sky, we taste the sand of the Kalahari Desert, and we feel the leisurely, gentle pace of everyday life in Botswana.<br />Ramotswe is a thoroughly entertaining character. She is fat and proud of her girth, and she is confident in her ability to read human nature. Ramotswe investigates cases of various con men, a misbehaving daughter, and a missing husband. Although she has no experience as a detective, she uses common sense, intuition, and her professional bible, \\"The Principles of Private Detection,\\" by Clovis Andersen, to guide her. More often than not, she comes to the correct conclusion.<br />However, Ramotswe is not simply a female Sherlock Holmes. She is a kind and compassionate individual who is careful to use the information she gleans to help her clients live a better life. Her support system consists of Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, mechanic extraordinaire (and her not-so-secret admirer) and her talented secretary, Mma Makutsi.<br />\\"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" is a throwback to a kinder gentler detective novel. Instead of violence and mayhem, Smith writes about the psychology of human nature and he emphasizes the importance of knowing who you are and of having a secure place in the world.

Elizabeth Berg's latest book, \\"Say When,\\" is the story of a marriage that is going downhill. Griffin and Ellen seem to have it made. They live comfortably in a Chicago suburb, and they adore their precocious eight-year-old daughter, Zoe. Suddenly, Ellen reveals that her marriage is unsatisfying and she asks Griffin for a divorce. Ellen tells Griffin that she is in love with a younger man who truly understands her.<br />Berg tells this story mostly from Griffin's point of view. For the first time in their marriage, Griffin starts to contemplate some of the ways that he and Ellen are different from one another. Ellen is cerebral, creative and spontaneous. Griffin is grounded, organized and predictable.  Ellen and Griffin have always had their differences, but Griffin believes that their marriage is still worth saving.<br />Berg writes with a delicate touch and gentle humor. I love the character of Griffin. He is a great father and a man of deep feeling and devotion. Many female readers will claim that he is a complete fabrication, since there are no men like Griffin on this earth. If that is so, then there should be. Ellen is a cipher and not a particularly sympathetic character. She comes across as flighty and capricious, although her love for Zoe is unwavering.<br />In \\"Say When,\\" Berg turns the cliche of the male having a midlife crisis on its ear. Here, it is the woman who needs to find herself, while the man wants his life to go on as it always has. Berg has written an entertaining contemporary novel that explores the theme of how difficult it is to sustain long-term relationships. After all, why stay married when divorce is such a quick solution to marital problems? Berg hits all the right notes in this touching, funny, wise and very satisfying novel.	2003-06-15

Now a psychologist and an educator, Dr. Frank relies on a number of helpful coping strategies and an indispensable support system to get him through each day. This makes Dr. Frank the ideal individual to write a book that teaches the layman how the dyslexic child thinks and feels. The author also makes practical suggestions that will help the dyslexic individual to succeed in school, in social situations and on the job.<br />Because Dr. Frank has trouble with the written word, he co-wrote this book with Kathryn Livingston. Together, they have produced a well-organized and practical guide for the parents and teachers of dyslexic children. Dr. Frank describes the emotional toll that dyslexia takes on children and on their parents. Too often, when dyslexia is diagnosed, parents react with shame and fear, eager to hide their child's problem from the world. Dr. Frank suggests that it would be far more productive to face the problem openly. When a child is taught that his problem is nothing to be ashamed of, and that he can succeed in life, he will feel better about himself. He can then learn coping strategies of his own and he will be unafraid to enlist the support of his teachers and his peers. Dr. Frank shows that the dyslexic child can have a bright and promising future if caring parents and concerned professionals are there to give him love, encouragement and guidance.	2003-06-08

Jodi Picoult's original new novel, \\"Second Glance,\\" is an ambitious undertaking. Picoult has created a large cast of characters, and for quite a while it is unclear how all of the characters interconnect. However, the reader's patience is rewarded when the author successfully weaves together all of the strands of her colorful and complex tapestry.<br />Most of \\"Second Glance\\" takes place in Comtosook, Vermont, near Lake Champlain. Ross Wakeman is a young man who has wanted to die since his girlfriend died in a car crash. Despite his efforts to kill himself, he has remained alive, and he is now a ghost hunter who investigates paranormal phenomena.<br />In Comtosook, an elderly man named Spencer Pike is dying, and he sells his land to a developer to build a strip mall. Members of the Abenaki tribe protest that since this land is a sacred burial ground, it should not be developed. Weird phenomena, such as rose petals falling from the sky and the land suddenly freezing solid, convince many residents of the town that the ghosts are showing their displeasure. The developer hires Ross to investigate the property in question to see if there are supernatural forces at work.<br />Besides Pike and Wakeman, there are many fascinating characters in \\"Second Glance.\\" Ross's sister, Shelby, is a courageous single mother whose son has a rare affliction that forces him to remain indoors except at night. Lucy Oliver is an eight-year-old who lives in terror, since she frequently sees ghosts. Az Thompson is a centenarian of the Abenaki tribe whose memories hold the key to many of the secrets of Comtosook.<br />Picoult's lyrical and sensual writing bring her story to vivid life. Especially noteworthy are the author's fascinating historical flashbacks to the Vermont Eugenics Project of the 1930's, a true and shameful chapter in the history of the United States. \\"Second Glance\\" is at times fanciful, romantic, dramatic and mysterious. Picoult shows us that love, life and death can never be completely understood. Another theme in \\"Second Glance\\" is that loving someone leaves us vulnerable to hurt and pain. However, the act of loving is reward enough in itself to make the risk worthwhile.e completely understood.

In David Morrell's new novel, \\"The Protector,\\" the hero is Cavanaugh (one name only), who used to be an operative in Delta Force. He is trained to handle threats with professionalism and expertise. As an employee of Global Protective Services, Cavanaugh has been assigned to guard a scientist named Daniel Prescott.  Cavanaugh plans to help Prescott escape his pursuers permanently by providing him with a brand new identity.<br />What Cavanaugh does not know is that Prescott is hiding some deadly secrets. Cavanaugh soon realizes that keeping Prescott alive will prove to be a difficult and costly task. Not only does the scientist have many enemies who will do anything to catch him, but he is a dangerous and paranoid man who trusts no one. Cavanaugh and his wife, Jamie, soon find themselves in a desperate struggle to survive, as the protector becomes a potential victim.<br />There are enough gun battles, fires, explosions and general mayhem in this book to satisfy the most bloodthirsty readers. The action is non-stop, and although the book is not particularly realistic, it is exciting and engrossing. Cavanaugh is a smart and well-trained operative, but he is also fallible and vulnerable, which is refreshing in an action-adventure novel. Cavanaugh's wife, Jamie, is a strong and capable fighter, and she and her husband make an effective team. If you like terse dialogue, danger and adrenaline-fueled battles to the death, then \\"The Protector\\" is the novel for you.	2003-06-08

Britt Andersen, a cable television news producer in Boston, is the heroine of Patricia MacDonald's latest thriller, \\"Suspicious Origin.\\" Britt has been estranged from her sister, Greta, for many years. When Britt learns that her sister was killed in a fire, she goes to Vermont to attend Greta's funeral. Britt meets her brother-in-law, Alec, and her eleven-year-old niece, Zoe, for the first time. Only later does Britt learn that the fire was deliberately set, and that, in fact, Greta was murdered.<br />MacDonald sets up her plot reasonably well, and in Britt, she has created a sympathetic, smart and vulnerable heroine. Although I thought that I had figured out the mystery by the halfway point of the book, it turned out that MacDonald had a few surprises up her sleeve. Unfortunately, the book's weaknesses outweigh its strengths. The dialogue is often wooden and the ending is somewhat contrived. Still, fans of spunky heroines may find \\"Suspicious Origin\\" to be a diverting thriller.	2003-06-05

In his seventh Jack Reacher novel, \\"Persuader,\\" Lee Child breaks no new ground. Reacher is still a macho, intelligent and compassionate individual. He is a combination of brains and brawn, a thinking man's fighting machine. Reacher has an encyclopedic knowledge of weaponry and he rarely forgets a face or lets go of an old grudge.<br />While in Boston, Reacher sees something that makes his blood run cold. In front of his eyes is a dead man walking. Reacher had killed a villain named Quinn ten years earlier. Not only had he shot Quinn in the head, but he also saw the body fall off a cliff. Now, Reacher spots Quinn getting into a chauffeured limousine near Symphony Hall, and that presents Reacher with a big problem. How did his nemesis escape death after being shot in the head and then falling off a cliff? More to the point, how can Reacher just go about his business, knowing that his old enemy is alive and well?<br />Reacher decides to get to Quinn by infiltrating the illegal organization of Zachary Beck, one of Quinn's associates. In the process, Reacher hooks up with federal agents who agree to work with him. They are hoping that Reacher can help them find a female agent who disappeared after going undercover to track Beck's activities.<br />\\"Persuader\\" features one nifty villain, a giant named Paulie who is hopped up on steroids. Punching Paulie is like attacking a brick wall. There is no character development in \\"Persuader\\" and none is needed. The book works because Lee Child delivers what the reader wants and expects. As in the old westerns, Jack Reacher is the lone gunman who rides into town to get rid of the bad guys. In a chaotic and unpredictable world, it is nice to know that there is a man who is unafraid of danger and who cannot rest until he gets the job done.	2003-06-01

Harlan Coben has become famous for thrillers with twists and turns that keep the reader guessing. His latest, \\"No Second Chance,\\" is about Dr. Marc Seidman, a successful plastic surgeon whose life is rapidly falling apart. An unknown assailant shoots the doctor and leaves him for dead. Twelve days later, Seidman regains consciousness and he learns that his wife, Monica, has also been shot and that his six-month-old daughter has disappeared. The police suspect that Seidman may have had something to do with both the attack on his wife and his baby's disappearance.<br />\\"No Second Chance\\" is mostly about Marc's attempt to find his daughter, Tara. Marc senses that his child is alive, and he will not rest until he finds out where she is. His investigation leads him in a number of directions, and he gladly accepts help from Rachel, an old girlfriend who used to be an FBI agent.<br />Harlan Coben made a major misstep when he wrote this illogical and far-fetched novel. The characters in \\"No Second Chance\\" are poorly developed, and the villains are simplistic stereotypes. The resolution is so convoluted that it requires about a dozen pages of exposition to explain it all, and even then it makes little sense. I do not recommend \\"No Second Chance\\" because Coben's plot is unfocused and bewildering instead of taut and exciting.	2003-05-28

He is a world-weary ex-cop, divorced and at loose ends since his retirement. Throughout his career with the Los Angeles Police Department, Harry has seen the best and worst of people. He has tangled with both bureaucrats and criminals and has lost part of his soul in the process. However, Harry has never lost his compassion for the victims.<br />One case still bothers Harry. Four years earlier, a young production assistant named Angella Benton was brutally murdered on her twenty-fourth birthday. Her death may be related to the theft of two million dollars on the movie set where Angella worked. Benton's killer was never found and Harry has decided to reopen the investigation on his own.<br />Since Harry has no official standing as a detective, he has to use guile to ferret out information. Harry angers some important people, including agents of the FBI who warn him to stop digging. Harry continues his inquiries anyway and he soon finds out that this surprising case is much more complicated than he could have imagined.<br />Connelly has created some wonderfully memorable characters in \\"Lost Light\\". There is Lawton Cross, an ex-cop who was shot and paralyzed during an apparent stickup. Cross has some key information for Harry that may break the Benton case wide open. Another character of note is Eleanor Wish, Harry's ex-wife and a professional gambler. Harry still has feelings for Eleanor and when he visits her in Vegas, he realizes that he is still in love with her.<br />\\"Lost Light\\" is a richly textured, well-crafted mystery in which all of the elements come together beautifully. Harry is a sharp, tough, and courageous individual who is determined to find the truth, even if it means risking his life. Harry works a case like a great artist. He misses nothing, and his intuition is unerring. If you enjoy a hard-edged detective story that is both fast-paced and complex, read \\"Lost Light\\". It is one of Michael Connelly's best novels.	2003-05-18

Risa Miller's first novel, \\"Welcome to Heavenly Heights,\\" is a series of vignettes about a group of people living in the same building on the West Bank.  The protagonists of this novel are American Jews who have left the comfort and security of their homes for a precarious existence as settlers in a disputed area of the Middle East.<br />Mike and Tova are one of the couples who make the move.  She is a bit skeptical about leaving their comfortable home in Baltimore, but Mike will not allow Tova's qualms to get in the way of his vision for their future.  Another settler is Debra, a convert who originally came from Appalachia.  She is the daughter of an absentee Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother.  Debra loves to sing and her sunny disposition is infectious.  Less sunny is Sandy, the mother of an only child, Yossi. Yossi has emotional problems and he is always getting into one scrape or another.  Sandy and her husband, Nathan, have their hands full keeping their rambunctious son on an even keel.<br />Miller's book is not political, nor is it linear.  There is no plot to speak of.  The author acts as a photographer, taking snapshots of the residents of building number four in Heavenly Heights.  We get to know these settlers only briefly and we see them as fallible people, each with his or her own issues, who have chosen to risk everything for their ideals.<br />Miller has attempted a difficult literary feat, and she does not completely succeed.  The book has an unfinished feel, and there are several sections that left me merely puzzled as to what the author was trying to say.  However, Miller does succeed in depicting the tremendous personal sacrifices that the settlers made when they chose to live in Heavenly Heights.	2003-05-18

Mary Higgins Clark's new suspense novel, \\"The Second Time Around,\\" is about the mysterious disappearance of Nicholas Spencer, the head a medical research company named Gen-Stone. Before his disappearance, Spencer had been touting a new vaccine that could be a breakthrough in the treatment of cancer. However, the vaccine that held so much promise now appears to have been a failure, and Spencer, who may have died when his private plane crashed, could actually have faked his own death. Rumors soon circulate that Spencer is off somewhere living the high life with his mistress, using funds that he looted from his own company and its shareholders.<br /><br />Carley DeCarlo is a spunky and ambitious reporter who is determined to find out the truth about Spencer. Was he a saint who risked his personal fortune and his reputation to help humanity? Or was he really a selfish and manipulative coward? Carly has personal and professional reasons for pursuing this story, and even after she receives death threats, she refuses to give up her investigation.<br />Clark is a competent writer and \\"The Second Time Around\\" is a workmanlike but lightweight mystery. Although the scientific aspects of this book do not bear too much scrutiny, Clark keeps the story moving along at a fast pace, and she inserts enough action to hold the reader's interest. As always, Clark uses no foul language and the violence is sanitized for squeamish readers. I recommend this novel for those who enjoy an unchallenging and mildly entertaining novel.	2003-05-11

Through genetic manipulation, an underclass, part man and part chimpanzee, has been created for the purpose of serving man.  This new creature, known as a \\"sim,\\" is docile and has no desire for money or sex; he or she theoretically cannot procreate.  For these reasons, sims make ideal servants and they are a source of enormous profit.  SimGen is a multibillion-dollar corporation that has the exclusive right to create and lease these creatures.  The owners will resort to anything, including violence, to keep the dollars rolling in.<br />Patrick Sullivan, a crafty labor lawyer, is shocked when he is approached by a sim who can read.  This sim works at a golf club and he wants Patrick to form a union for sims. Patrick, along with a mysterious individual named Zero and a woman named Romy Cadman, risk their lives by fighting for the right of sims to be considered as individuals, not products.<br />Although, in lesser hands, this story could have come across as silly or maudlin, Wilson manages to imbue his novel with enough gentle humor, pathos, and suspense to make it work.  \\"Sims\\" has its imperfections.  At over four hundred pages, it is unnecessarily long and repetitious.  The villains are stereotypes and they are unbelievably inept considering the resources at their disposal.  However, the David and Goliath aspect of the novel has a certain appeal and Wilson is skilled at presenting fascinating scientific background about genetics.  \\"Sims\\" is a timely and exciting novel about the danger of technology without morality.	2003-05-06

In her previous novels, Anita Shreve has tackled the thorny subject of how men and women often operate at cross-purposes. In \\"All He Ever Wanted,\\" Shreve writes from the point of view of a man, Nicholas Van Tassel, who is a college teacher in a small New Hampshire town in 1899. Van Tassel, by chance, encounters a young woman with the unlikely name of Etna Bliss, and he is immediately smitten with her. Van Tassel refuses to listen when Etna insists that she can never reciprocate his love, and he asks her to marry him. This decision will come back to haunt him.<br />Shreve chose unwisely when she decided to write the book from Nicholas's point of view. He is a pompous, selfish, and shortsighted individual, who for much of the book is blind to his own shortcomings. He makes an unreliable and irritating narrator. The author should have told the book from Etna's point of view, for she is by far the most interesting character in the book. We learn little about Etna's inner life, and what we learn is told from Nicholas's skewed viewpoint.<br />We do find out that Etna has a secret and tumultuous past, one that she chooses not to share with her husband. Nicholas, who is a pompous chauvinist, does not sympathize with his wife and his clumsy efforts to control her behavior inevitably backfire. Shreve's narrative style is occasionally heavy-handed and overwrought in this novel, and her lack of subtlety weakens the book.<br />What keeps me interested in reading Shreve's novels is her compassion for her characters. Both Nicholas and Etna are stuck in certain roles, and neither one is flexible enough to change. Since these two individuals are so different from one another, and so lacking in any understanding of one another's needs, their relationship can only bring heartbreak. Anita Shreve has always been an expert at expressing the sorrow of unhappily married couples.	2003-05-04

In Steve Martini's \\"The Arraignment,\\" criminal defense attorney Paul Madriani is horrified when a friend of his is gunned down before his eyes.  For a variety of reasons, Madriani does not leave it up to the police to catch the killer.  He starts an investigation of his own, hoping to uncover the truth behind his friend's death. Madriani has his friend's electronic organizer, which he conceals from the police, and he uses this vital piece of evidence to track down leads.  Along with his partner, Harry Hinds, Madriani crosses the border into Mexico, where he risks his life to confront his friend's killer.<br />\\"The Arraignment\\" does not work as a legal thriller or as a mystery.  All of the characters in this book are one-dimensional stick figures, such as Dana, the blonde and shallow trophy wife, Margaret, the bitter ex-wife who was replaced by Dana, and Adam Tolt, the power-hungry head of a large law firm.  Madriani has very little reason to neglect his law practice and risk his life doing police work.  Nor does he have any good reason to obstruct justice and withhold vital evidence from the authorities. Since he is a single parent with a child, one would expect Madriani to be more circumspect with his health and safety and more concerned with his professional ethics.<br />The plot of \\"The Arraignment\\" is extremely complicated and the ending makes very little sense. Martini tediously stretches the book out to four hundred pages for no apparent reason.  \\"The Arraignment\\" is one of Martini's weakest books and I do not recommend it.	2003-04-27

In John Lescroart's new thriller, \\"The First Law,\\" San Francisco resembles the Wild West. A corrupt and malicious individual named Wade Panos wields tremendous political power.  Panos and his gang rob and murder whomever they please with impunity, and the police either cannot or will not stop them.<br />Abe Glitsky, a veteran detective, has been moved out of homicide and into the payroll department of the police force, much to his chagrin. However, when Sam Silverman, an elderly friend of Abe's father, is robbed and murdered, Abe takes a look at the case. Much to his surprise, Abe is stymied in his inquiries at every turn; it soon becomes clear that his colleagues on the force do not want Abe interfering in their investigation. To make matters worse, Abe's good friend, Dismas Hardy, represents a man who is being framed for killing Sam. As Abe and Dismas continue to challenge Wade Panos, dead bodies begin piling up and it becomes clear that if Dismas and Abe do not back off, they may be risking their lives.<br />I love the characters of Dismas Hardy and Abe Glitsky. They are macho and sensitive as well as intelligent and compassionate. I admit that the plot of \\"The First Law\\" is a bit far-fetched. It is difficult to believe that such lawlessness would prevail in a city as cosmopolitan as San Francisco. However, Lescroart makes the point that evil people with no conscience do exist. If normally law-abiding citizens are to fight such individuals, they sometimes have to act in unorthodox ways in order to survive.<br />At four hundred pages, \\"The First Law\\" is a bit too long. However, the plot and the dialogue are lively and compelling and the characters are nicely drawn. Lescroart maintains a high level of suspense and excitement until \\"The First Law\\" reaches its dramatic and action-packed conclusion.	2003-04-25

Joshua Gilder's first novel, \\"Ghost Image,\\" is a strange amalgam. It is part medical mystery, part psychological thriller, and part crime novel. Unfortunately, these disparate elements do not come together to form a satisfying whole.<br />The hero of \\"Ghost Image\\" is Jackson Maebry, a promising young plastic surgeon and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the brilliant and successful Dr. Peter Brandt. Jackson's girlfriend, Allie Sorosh, is a beauty with a mysterious past whom Jackson has asked to be his wife. Allie puts Jackson off, and they have a terrible quarrel. Soon thereafter, Allie is admitted to the hospital in a coma, after being brutally beaten and burned almost to death. Who did this to Allie and why? Will Allie be able to recover from her horrible wounds, both external and internal? To make matters worse, the police begin to suspect that Jackson may have attacked Allie in a fit of rage.<br />Gilder does a wonderful job with the medical elements in this novel. The information about how a plastic surgeon does his work is detailed and fascinating. The psychological elements are less expertly handled. The characters of Jackson, Allie and Brandt are muddled and they become more so as the novel progresses. Gilder's plot starts out promisingly, but it lapses into implausibility as the book reaches its melodramatic climax. \\"Ghost Image\\" had potential, but Josha Gilder ultimately does not succeed in delivering the goods.	2003-04-25

Grooten's dead body is found in the sarcophagus of an Egyptian princess.  Who murdered Grooten and placed her in this unusual coffin?  Assistant DA Alexandra Cooper is on the case, along with her pals, detectives Mike Chapman and Mercer Wallace.<br />The problem with &quot;The Bone Vault&quot; is that the mystery element is almost nonexistent.  There is no tension, there are no thrills, and the ending is almost anticlimactic.  However, as in Fairstein's &quot;The Deadhouse,&quot; the author's thorough research has made &quot;The Bone Vault&quot; a treasure trove of information.  The reader is treated to arcane and fascinating details about two of the greatest museums in the world, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Natural History.  We learn about their vast and varied collections, their tremendous storehouses, and the army of people who keep these institutions up and running.  Fairstein loves her subject; her enthusiasm and vivid descriptions make the museums the most interesting characters in the book.<br />Fairstein, as always, writes lighthearted and cute banter for Alex and her friends, and she is always sharp when it comes to legal matters and police procedure.  The book could have been so much better had Fairstein written a more intriguing story.  As it stands, I give &quot;The Bone Vault&quot; a marginal recommendation.	2003-04-21

I loved the character of Jim Swope, an individual whose childhood traumas have left lasting scars, especially in his ability to relate to women. Jim is also a loving father and a courageous man who is willing to learn from his mistakes. I liked the character of Stephanie Riggs, as well.  She is a tough and intelligent doctor who is dogged in her pursuit of the truth about the syndrome that has destroyed her sister.<br />Emerson balances the book's humorous and serious aspects skillfully and he maintains a high level of excitement throughout the novel.

Before long, Allon discovers that Beni was murdered because he was about to reveal some damaging and controversial information about the relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and Nazi Germany during World War II.  Allon's quest for Beni's killer pits him against powerful and dangerous members of a secret organization who will stop at nothing to keep their dirty secrets buried.<br />As he did in \\"The English Assassin,\\" Silva makes good use of some colorful locales in Europe.  The scene switches frequently between Italy, Germany, Austria and France, as the tense drama unfolds.  Silva skillfully describes the political machinations and friction between a progressive Pope and the reactionary individuals who oppose him.<br />The characters in \\"The Confessor\\" are lively, the action is electrifying, and the plot is filled with unpredictable twists and turns.  Silva, once again, shows great courage in tackling a topic that will make many people uncomfortable.  Did the Catholic Church turn its back on the Jews during World War II, and if so, why?  Although this question may never be answered fully, it is important to keep asking it, until the secret documents that are hidden in the Vatican's archives are opened for all the world to see.	2003-04-13

Dr. Sylvia Strange is about to marry the love of her life, Matt England, and she should be in a state of prenuptial bliss. Instead, Sylvia is goaded into taking one last case before her wedding. \\"Dark Alchemy\\" is the story of a serial killer who uses sophisticated neurotoxins to murder fellow scientists. The FBI suspects Dr. Christine Palmer, the world's foremost expert on these deadly poisons. Since all the evidence against Dr. Palmer is circumstantial, the authorities need more information to move the investigation forward.<br />Counterterrorism expert Edmond Sweetheart has been asked by the FBI to step in, and he in turn recruits Dr. Strange to help him construct a psychological profile of the killer. Sylvia would prefer to immerse herself in her wedding plans, but the case interests her and she decides to lend her expertise to the investigation.<br />The book starts out promisingly. Lovett piques the reader's interest with her arcane information on neurotoxins and their deadly effects. Dr. Palmer is an intriguing character. She is beautiful, brilliant and egotistical, but is she also a killer?  To make matters more complicated, Sylvia's personal problems keep distracting her. Although she and Matt truly love one another, they still have some unresolved issues that may disrupt their wedding plans.<br />Unfortunately, after a strong opening, \\"Dark Alchemy\\" unravels in the second half of the book. Various suspects are dangled before the reader, and the plot becomes more and more illogical as the book progresses.  The ending is rushed and the conclusion is unsatisfying. Had Lovett taken the time to develop her plot with more care, \\"Dark Alchemy\\" would have been a much better novel.	2003-04-13

Gail Connor and Anthony Quintana are two high powered and intense lawyers who have had a rocky relationship over the years.  They take a break from their busy schedules to spend a few days in a beautiful inn on a secluded island in the Florida Keys.  This is the setting for Barbara Parker's latest suspense novel, \\"Suspicion of Madness.\\"<br />Connor and Quintana are guests at a place called The Buttonwood Inn.  The proprietors of the inn, Martin and Teri Greenwald, have invited Gail and Anthony to be their guests in return for Anthony's legal assistance.  Teri has a son, Billy, from a former marriage, and her son is a suspect in a murder case.  The Greenwalds are hoping that Anthony can help prove Billy's innocence.<br />Gail and Anthony meet an assortment of odd characters during this trip. They include Martin's overbearing sister, Lois, a strange former actress named Joan Sinclair, who acts like Gloria Swanson from \\"Sunset Boulevard,\\" a disreputable and conniving attorney, and a creepy handyman.  All of these people are together on this isolated island when a ferocious storm hits. Naturally, dead bodies begin to pile up and it soon becomes apparent that a madman is on the loose.<br />Parker's usual crisp writing style is nowhere in sight this time around.  At almost 370 pages, the book meanders along its slow path, and very little happens during large portions of the novel.  The dialogue is forced and unconvincing and the plot is contrived and silly.  Even the chemistry between Connor and Quintana cannot save \\"Suspicion of Madness\\" from being a below average and rather dull thriller.	2003-04-07

In his latest novel, \\"The King of Torts,\\" John Grisham explores a topic that he has dealt with many times in the past. Can an individual be a successful lawyer and a moral individual? Or are the words \\"honest lawyer\\" paradoxical?<br />Clay Carter is a bright young public defender in Washington, D. C., where he has worked for five years. He is thirty-one, burned out, underpaid and frustrated. Clay's girlfriend, Rebecca, loves him but her snooty parents loathe both Clay and the career path that he has chosen. They want Rebecca to dump Clay and find a better matrimonial prospect.<br />Suddenly, Clay's career takes a weird turn. A murder case falls into his lap, and there are aspects of this investigation that simply do not add up. Soon, a mysterious stranger appears and convinces Clay that it would be in his best interests to quit the Public Defender's office and become a mass tort lawyer. His main job would be to collect the names of individuals who were harmed by pharmaceutical companies, sign these people up, and file class action suits on their behalf. Clay is seduced by the promise of fame and fortune, and he soon becomes \\"The King of Torts.\\" Can Clay keep his wits about him after he tastes the high life of private planes, yachts, beautiful women, and fancy real estate? Or is he selling his soul in the process of becoming wealthy and successful?<br />Grisham's breezy writing style is pleasant and easy to take. The book moves forward at a fast pace and its theme about the downside of greed is certainly a timely one. However, the plot is a bit far-out and the ending is both heavy-handed and predictable. Unfortunately, \\"The King of Torts\\" is more a morality tale than it is a novel.	2003-04-06

In Peter Robinson's latest Inspector Banks novel, \\"Close to Home,\\" Banks interrupts an idyllic vacation on a Greek island to look into the death of a childhood friend.  Graham Marshall, a \\"mate\\" of Alan Banks when they were both teenagers, disappeared in 1965.  A worker digging the foundation for a new shopping center unexpectedly uncovers a skeleton that turns out to be Graham's remains.  Who killed Graham and why? Coincidentally, Banks, along with his former lover, Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot,  also begins looking into the disappearance of Luke Armitage, a troubled teenager from a well-known family.<br />Banks has changed greatly over the years. He is mellower and more reflective than he has ever been before.  Although he still likes to smoke and drink, Banks is beginning to feel the effects a bit more, and he is actually trying to cut down.  In addition, now that his ex-wife and children have moved on with their lives, Banks has had a great deal of time to take stock of where his own life is heading.<br />\\"Close to Home\\" has many of Peter Robinson's trademark touches.  The author delves deeply into the psyche of his characters.  Robinson takes the time to humanize the police officers, the criminals, and the suspects in his novels.  The reader becomes involved with their predicaments and deeply invested in the outcome of the story.  In addition, Robinson introduces another interesting female character, Detective Inspector Michelle Hart, a woman with a tragic past to whom Banks is attracted.<br />In \\"Close to Home,\\" unfortunately, Robinson missteps a bit.  First of all, he has gone to the well once too often when he chose the \\"bones uncovered after many years\\" story line.  This plot was used successfully in Robinson's own \\"In a Dry Season\\", and again in at least three other mysteries that I have read recently.  I am surprised at this lack of originality in an author as creative as Robinson.  In addition, at almost four hundred pages, the book meanders a bit and takes too long to reach its melodramatic denouement.<br />In addition, Robinson is a little too heavy handed when he hammers home his recurring theme, which is that the past is never really behind us.  Until we come to terms with the events of long ago, and until we exorcise the demons that plague us, we can never hope to face the future and find happiness in life.  Robinson has expressed this viewpoint in his previous novels many times, but with more finesse and subtlety than he does here.  I have come to expect a great deal from an author as accomplished as Peter Robinson.

Nasaw combines whimsical humor and terror expertly, without either element throwing the novel out of balance. His villain is an incredibly cold and malicious individual; yet, Nasaw fleshes out the murderer's personality so that we understand how he became so monstrous. All of this is packaged in a fast-moving, incredibly exciting and suspenseful story.<br /><br />An unknown assailant is targeting a group of people who suffer from specific phobia disorders (fear of heights, snakes, drowning and masks are some examples). The killer makes the murders appear to be suicides, but one individual, a phobic herself named Dorrie Bell, suspects that these were no suicides. For example, an acrophobic (a person who fears high places) apparently jumped out of a twelfth-story window. Dorrie doesn't buy it.<br /><br />Two unlikely candidates decide to help Dorrie find the out the truth. One is E. L. Pender, an overweight, fifty-six year old Special Agent of the FBI. Although Pender is on the brink of retirement, he cannot resist getting involved in one more case. The other is Linda Abruzzi, a thirty-five year old woman with a disability. Abruzzi stubbornly refuses to leave the FBI, even though her superiors have made it clear that they no longer value her services.<br /><br />Abruzzi and Pender use their considerable skills to track their adversary, who is clever, ruthless and very dangerous. Nasaw ratchets up the tension almost unbearably as the book progresses. The scenes in which the killer confronts the phobics with what they fear most are not for the faint-hearted.<br /><br />The dialogue and plotting in \\"Fear Itself\\" is terrific and the novel is perfectly paced. Nasaw depicts all of the characters, both major and minor, with care and they all contribute to the complex story. The author provides fascinating background information on phobia disorders, which helps the reader to understand and empathize with the plight of the victims. If you have a strong stomach, if you like nasty villains, and if enjoy a dose of both humor and horror with your suspense, pick up \\"Fear Itself.\\" Just be sure to leave the light on.with the plight of the victims.

Stephen White's latest book, \\"The Best Revenge,\\" is an exciting and surprising thriller that grabs the reader and never lets go.  It is about a former medical student named Tom Clone, who was convicted years ago of murdering a young woman.  Clone ends up on Death Row, but he is released from prison when new DNA evidence suggests that he may be innocent.  Clone is baffled but gratified at his sudden good fortune.  However, some of the people he meets think that Clone is guilty, and he receives death threats from those who would like to execute him themselves.<br />Special Agent Kelda James helped get Tom Clone out of jail, and she has some serious problems of her own.  She suffers from intense and almost unrelenting pain in her legs, for which the doctors have no cure.  In addition, she has to deal with Tom Clone's romantic interest in her, which makes her feel uncomfortable.<br />Both Clone and James are seeing psychologist Alan Gregory.  Gregory would like to help these two confused and troubled individuals.  However, the psychologist soon discovers that getting in too deep with this pair may be both professionally and personally costly.<br />White sets up an incredibly complicated plot and he makes it work.  He uses the Colorado setting to great effect; White's vivid descriptions of the Rocky Mountain State help the novel come to life. The book is also remarkable for its psychological complexity.  White's writing has several dimensions.  Not only does he effectively describe how people behave under stress, but he also explores how guilt, lies and the thirst for revenge can eat away at peoples lives.  Finally, the author skillfully tackles the thorny issue of whether or not our criminal justice system can be trusted to mete out justice fairly.  \\"The Best Revenge\\" is a thought-provoking and well-written thriller that I highly recommend.	2003-03-16

Ramon Willis is on Death Row in Texas at the beginning of \\"Living Proof,\\" a thriller by first-time author Peter Thompson. Willis was convicted of murder, and he is on the verge of being executed, despite his repeated claims of innocence. Lena Dryer is an ambitious reporter who interviews Ramon for a series of newspaper articles that she is writing on the death penalty. Soon, Ramon becomes a target when he uncovers a bizarre conspiracy involving the prison system and high-ranking members of the military. He enlists Lena's aid and the pair frantically try to stop the plan before it is implemented. If Ramon and Lena are caught, they will be quickly eliminated.<br />Thompson does a good job of setting up the novel. His opening sequences effectively draw the reader into the action. Thompson's characterization of the death penalty, Texas style, is chilling and realistic. Without editorializing, the author brings home the horrifying nature of assembly-line executions.<br />Thompson maintains a high level of suspense throughout the book, keeping the reader turning pages anxiously to see how the story will play out. I liked the character of Ramon, an intelligent and compassionate individual who used his time in prison to \\"get his act together\\".<br />There are a few areas where the book falters. Conspiracy theories are a staple of current fiction, and the conspiracy in \\"Living Proof\\" is a little too far out to be believed. The villains are stereotypes, with no shading or subtlety. In addition, as the book progresses, the plot becomes rushed and repetitious, as the good guys constantly scramble to stay one step ahead of the bad guys.<br />However, \\"Living Proof\\" is a worthy first effort. Peter Thompson is a promising author with a knack for writing suspense and I look forward to his development as a writer.	2003-03-11

Dr. Mel Levine, founder of \\"All Kinds of Minds Institute\\" and the Director of \\"The Center for Development and Learning,\\" debunks \\"The Myth of Laziness.\\" Levine maintains that everyone longs to be productive and useful, and that some children who are called lazy by their parents, teachers or peers, may in reality be suffering from \\"output failure.\\"<br />Dr. Levine maintains that a whole spectrum of neuro-development dysfunctions may prevent children from reaching their potential. Examples of such dysfunctions are difficulty expressing oneself orally or in writing, an inability to organize one's time, workspace or materials, or a problem as basic as \\"graphomotor breakdown.\\" This means that a student's writing is sabotaged by movement problems that prevent his or her fingers from capturing ideas and putting them down on paper.<br />In his specialty as a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, Levine has spent thirty years working with children who have had difficulty living up to the expectations of their parents, their schools and themselves. Levine has strategies for helping these children, starting with specific tests to diagnose which area of memory, language, attention, or motor function is causing the problem. He also suggests ways that that children can compensate for their deficits and make better use of their strengths.<br />\\"The Myth of Laziness\\" is an informative look at some of the obstacles that many kids face during their school years. Readers should be warned, however, that the book contains hard-to-follow psychological and educational jargon. Fortunately, many case studies help clarify Levine's ideas for the reader who is not familiar with the language of developmental psychology. Principals, teachers, and parents should read this book and consider how they can incorporate some of its ideas in both public and private school programs. Perhaps, if kids with \\"output failures\\" receive skilled help at an early age, they may succeed in school and in life instead of falling through the cracks.ead of falling through the cracks.	2003-03-10

In his fifty-second 87th Precinct novel, Ed McBain features the loathsome and obese sexist bigot, Fat Ollie, who has finally finished his own police procedural, \\"Report to the Commissioner.\\" Oliver Weeks sees himself as a literary lion in the making. The protagonist of his rather brief novel is Ollie's female and slim alter ego, whom he names Olivia Wesley Watts.  Unfortunately, Fat Ollie never got around to making a copy of his manuscript, which he composed on an old fashioned typewriter. When Ollie leaves the novel in a dispatch case in his car, a junkie steals the case and its precious contents.<br />\\"Fat Ollie's Book\\" has many of McBain's trademark touches. It is politically incorrect and filled with flippant dialogue. The author seamlessly threads three main plot lines throughout the book and they cleverly overlap at times. A prominent councilman who may be planning to run for mayor is shot while preparing for a rally. A pair of cops is hoping to interrupt a big drug sale. And, of course, Ollie is determined to find the perp who ripped off his precious book.<br />McBain's 87th precinct novels are always entertaining, and \\"Fat Ollie's Book\\" gets high marks for its large and colorful cast of characters, its fast moving story and its self-mockery. McBain quotes large sections of Ollie's book, and through Ollie, McBain makes fun of the conventions of the police procedural. McBain's fictional city of Isola is a homage to New York City, with its high-octane excitement, its political pressure and the desperation and chutzpah of its criminal element.<br />Ed McBain has won every award that is available to a mystery writer. \\"Fat Ollie's Book\\" makes it clear why McBain has remained successful for so many years, while lesser talents have fallen by the wayside. This novel, like so many others in this series, is witty, smart and irreverent, and I recommend it.	2003-03-09

Jacko Vance is, to his adoring public, a saint on earth. After losing his lower right arm while attempting to save several victims at the scene of a terrible car accident, Jacko becomes a famous television personality and a tireless charity worker. What no one knows is that this seemingly kind and selfless man is hiding a monstrous secret.<br />Jacko's adversaries are Dr. Tony Hill, a skilled psychological profiler, and DCI Carol Jordan, Hill's former lover and someone whose judgment and skills he still values. What begins as an exercise in profiling turns deadly serious when one of Hill's young students is found brutally murdered and mutilated. Hill and Jordan pull out all the stops to find the serial killer whom they believe is responsible for the disappearance of a number of teenaged girls as well as the murder of the young police officer whom Dr. Hill was training.<br />Val McDermid's writing is not for the squeamish. She depicts Jacko's sadism in great detail and she doesn't shrink from killing off likeable characters. I think that McDermid went a little overboard in making Jacko Vance almost too expert in his manipulation of the public and the police. The author unfairly paints the police as naive bumblers, needing Hill and Jordan to do their sleuthing for them. I doubt that real police officers would be as vulnerable to Vance's charm.<br />At approximately five hundred pages, the book is a bit too long. It could have been more concise with no loss of plot or character development. A secondary plot about a serial arsonist adds little to the novel. However, McDermid keeps the suspense at a high level throughout the book and her writing is always skillful and hard-hitting. All in all, \\"The Wire in the Blood\\" is a reasonably good, but not extraordinary, psychological thriller.	2003-02-23

However, Lerner is self-conscious about her weight and she believes that if she could only learn how to control her eating, she would be blissfully happy.<br /><br />Lerner's adolescent years are filled with cigarettes, joints, a membership in Overeaters Anonymous and a fruitless relationship with an unsympathetic psychiatrist. Nothing that Lerner tries brings her peace of mind and she eventually sinks into a serious depression. She frequently indulges in binge eating. It takes a stint in a mental hospital and a caring psychiatrist to help Lerner diagnose her problem and gain some control over her life.<br /><br />&#34;Food and Loathing&#34; is a searing and honest portrayal of a lost soul. For quite a while, Lerner has no handle on what is wrong with her; she longs for peace and equilibrium but has no idea how to attain them. Finally, she realizes that life’s pleasures are too precious to sacrifice without a fight. Although Lerner's book has little new to say either about eating disorders or mental illness, this a competently written work of non-fiction about a vulnerable individual whose emotional turmoil led to years of suffering.	2003-02-23

William Coughlin has been dead for years, yet the books keep coming.  His latest posthumous legal thriller is \\"Proof of Intent,\\" written by Walter Sorrells.  This novel brings back Charley Sloan, a slick criminal defense attorney who is a recovering alcoholic.  Charley has a shaky relationship with his grown daughter, Lisa.  She, like her father, is an alcoholic and she has recently dropped out of law school.  While her father has remained sober for seven years, Lisa is having trouble staying on the wagon.<br />Charley and Lisa team up to defend Miles Dane, a writer of pulp fiction who is accused of bludgeoning his wife, Diane, to death.  Miles claims that he worshipped Diane, and he would never think of harming her.  Sloan faces a hostile judge, a skilled prosecuting attorney, and a mountain of circumstantial evidence that points to Miles Dane as the murderer.  Charley and Lisa have their work cut out for them in this difficult case.<br />Sorrells does a creditable job of setting up the characters and making them believable.  Charley is, as he has been in the past, sharp, funny, resourceful, and not above pulling shady courtroom stunts to help his client.  His daughter, Lisa, is not fully fleshed out, but she is an intriguing character and I would like to see more of her.<br />The courtroom scenes in \\"Proof of Intent\\" are dramatic and suspenseful and the murder mystery is engrossing.  The problem with this novel is the contrived ending, which seemed tacked on to \\"surprise\\" the reader.  However, I still recommend \\"Proof of Intent,\\" since it moves forward briskly and does what a legal thriller should do.  Sorrells holds the reader's interest until the end and he does so with considerable style.	2003-02-16

Alvarez's classic book, \\"The Savage God,\\" examines the religious, sociological, philosophical and literary aspects of suicide through the ages.  In pagan Rome, suicide was habitual and considered an honorable way to die.  In the Middle Ages, suicide was regarded with revulsion as a mortal sin.  Dante, in his \\"Inferno,\\" consigned suicides to the seventh circle of hell, below the burning heretics and murderers.  Later on, the Romantics associated premature death with genius and they admired people who ended their lives while they were still at their artistic peak. Throughout history, mankind has viewed suicide as everything from an unforgivable crime of self-murder to the sad act of a person for whom living has become intolerable.<br /><br />In a more personal vein, Alvarez discusses the fascinating poet Sylvia Plath, with whom he was acquainted, as well as his own depression and attempted suicide.  The section on Plath is superb.  Alvarez was fond of Plath and he admired her work greatly.  He reveals in a clear-eyed manner how the forces tearing her apart were stronger than those holding her together. \\"The Savage God\\" is an absorbing look at a subject often spoken of in whispers.  The author points out that people who lose parents at an early age are more likely to take their own lives.  He also examines in depth the strong and mysterious link between creative genius and the impulse toward suicide.  \\"The Savage God\\" sheds light on the human condition in all of its complexity.  Yet Alvarez never presumes to provide easy answers to questions that are unanswerable.	2003-02-09

Thomas Perry's &quot;Dead Aim&quot; is the suspenseful but ultimately far-fetched story of Robert Mallon.  Mallon retired at thirty-eight with a hefty bank account, an ex-wife and a great deal of time on his hands.  He lives a low-key life among the affluent residents of Santa Barbara, California.  Now, at forty-eight, his life has settled into a predictable rhythm.<br />This rhythm is disrupted when, one day, Mallon pulls a suicidal young woman out of the ocean.  The woman refuses to tell Mallon her name, and not long afterwards, she disappears without a trace.  Mallon has the time and money to find out the identity of this woman and he decides to hire a former colleague, Lydia Marks, to help him with his investigation.  Too late, Mallon discovers that he has placed himself and Marks in grave danger by meddling in this unknown woman's affairs.<br />Perry's fast-paced narrative and crisp dialogue make &quot;Dead Aim&quot; an exciting and suspenseful thriller.  Unfortunately, the truth behind the strange events that Mallon uncovers is absurd.  There is one particular coincidence that will make you groan.  What a shame.  Perry is an extremely talented writer and Mallon is one of those good-hearted and straightforward characters whom you can't help but like.  The action sequences are nicely done, but Mallon's ability to take on his enemies make him seem more like James Bond than a retired construction worker.  &quot;Dead Aim&quot; is an enjoyable escapist novel of suspense, but you will need to suspend your disbelief over and over again as you read it.	2003-02-09

The use of cheap fats to make foods taste better and maximize profits for manufacturers is one factor.  The decrease in physical education programs for children and the introduction of fast food outlets in schools is another.  Critser also blames parents for abdicating their roles as influential authority figures who should be monitoring what their kids eat.<br />The tone of \\"Fat Land\\" is a bit too strident, and the endless statistics and studies that Critser cites to bolster his arguments slow down the narrative considerably.  The author's moralizing about gluttony and will power comes across as patronizing.  His dismissal of the dangers of anorexia and his insistence that parents should control what their kids eat is naive.<br />Unfortunately, most of the ideas that Critser offers to reverse America's obesity epidemic are unlikely to work.  In today's fast-paced society, parents and children rarely sit down together to eat nutritious meals.  Schools, with their austerity budgets, are probably not going to pour money into physical fitness programs.  Children are not likely to abandon their computers and video games to become more physically active.  Fast food outlets will not sacrifice profits to improve the health of their patrons.<br />Therefore, \\"Fat Land\\" is at best a wake-up call for those who are willing to face some harsh facts.  The food that we put into our mouths may determine not only how long we live, but also how healthy we will be as we get older.ts.

Sheldon Siegel, in his third book, \\"Criminal Intent,\\" brings back Mike Daley and Rosie Fernandez.  Daley and Fernandez are law partners and former spouses who get along better as colleagues than they do as husband and wife.  They both share a deep love for their daughter, Grace, and they consistently support one another through family crises and illnesses.<br /><br />A big crisis arises when the police find Rosie's niece, Angelina, near the Golden Gate Bridge late one night after her husband, Richard MacArthur, has been bludgeoned to death with his own Academy Award.  Angel claims that she does not know how she got to the bridge, since she blacked out earlier in the evening after a party at her husband's mansion.  The police do not believe Angel's flimsy story and they arrest her for murder.  Angel had motive, means and opportunity to kill Richard, and the media-savvy San Francisco District Attorney, Nicole Ward, intends to nail her.  Angel turns to her Aunt Rosie and Rosie's law partner, Mike, to represent her.<br /><br />Siegel's easygoing writing style, astute characterizations and gentle humor make him one of the better writers of legal thrillers at work today.  Rosie and Mike are intelligent, resourceful and compassionate characters, and it is interesting to see how their relationship works both on a professional and a personal level.  Several subplots about Rosie's battle with breast cancer, Mike's relationship with a beautiful judge and an expensive construction project involving bribes and extortion are seamlessly interwoven into the main plot about MacArthur's murder.<br /><br />By the time all of the elements have been sorted out, Siegel brings the book to a satisfying and realistic conclusion.  I highly recommend the entertaining \\"Criminal Intent\\" as well as Siegel's two other legal thrillers featuring Mike Daley and Rosie Fernandez.	2003-02-02

It is also a whimsical and entertaining novel by Ann Patchett. The book takes place in an unnamed country in South America.  A birthday party has been arranged for a prominent Japanese businessman named Mr. Hosokawa.  The only reason that Mr. Hosokawa has agreed to come to this party in his honor is that Roxanne Coss, a world famous soprano, is there to sing for the assembled guests.  Ms. Coss does sing brilliantly and all seems to be going well.  Unfortunately, the party turns sour quickly when a band of revolutionaries breaks into the house and holds the guests hostage.<br /><br />Patchett, in a display of literary virtuosity, brings the characters in \\"Bel Canto\\" to brilliant life.  With wit, humor and pathos, the author shows how living in close quarters with strangers sometimes brings out the best in people.  Mr. Hosokawa, who is usually a businesslike automaton, blossoms into a sensitive and caring individual under the influence of Roxanne and her lovely music.  Gen Watanable, who is Hosokawa's translator and secretary, falls in love with one of the female revolutionaries, and his life also takes off in unexpected directions.<br /><br />Patchett touches on many themes in \\"Bel Canto,\\" such as the power of glorious music to touch our souls and the importance of seeking beauty and romance in our lives. Since the world we live in is sometimes a barbaric place, it is not always possible for peace and love to flourish.  Therefore, Patchett seems to be saying, it is vital to seize those rare moments in our lives when we can enjoy everything that is wonderful and amazing around us. \\"Bel Canto\\" is marred by a pace that is a bit too leisurely and by a somewhat unsatisfying conclusion.  However, overall, it is an entertaining novel that is notable not only for the author's development of character, but also for her imagination, originality and wonderful use of language.e.	2003-01-26

Investigative reporter Mitchell Zuckoff spent hundreds of hours with Tierney and Greg, and the result is \\"Choosing Naia,\\" a book that began as a series of articles in the Boston Globe.  This is the story of a couple's arduous journey, an eye-opening look at the history of Down syndrome, and a detailed explanation of what such a diagnosis means for the child and his parents.<br /><br />Zuckoff's conversational style makes \\"Choosing Naia\\" flow smoothly.  The author explores such topics as genetic testing and counseling, the value of networking, and the importance of early intervention for children with Down syndrome.  \\"Choosing Naia\\" stands out for its unflinching honesty.

In 1946, Zvi Kolitz, who was a journalist and an ardent Zionist, wrote a short work of fiction in Yiddish.  It was called \\"Yosl Rakover Talks to God.\\"  Kolitz put himself in the shoes of a man who was about to meet his death in the conflagration of the Warsaw Ghetto.  Before he dies, Yosl confronts God and pours out his anguish and his testament of faith.<br /><br />Over the years, this short manuscript passed through many hands, and a myth grew up around it.  Many people insisted that it was an authentic document written by someone who really lived in the Warsaw Ghetto.  Zvi Kolitz was disassociated from the work that he had written. The story itself is touching and meaningful.  Yosl says that no matter what hardships and pain God sends his way, he is proud to be a Jew, and his belief in God is unwavering.<br /><br />He thinks that, for some reason, God has decided to turn his face away from his people.  Therefore, the Nazis and their cohorts had few obstacles to overcome in their mission to rid Europe of its Jewish population.  Yosl takes the liberty of chastising God for putting the Jewish people through so much suffering.  Following the story is an illuminating essay by Paul Badde, explaining the many twists and turns that this manuscript took since its original publication, and he provides insights into the life and philosophy of Zvi Kolitz.  Although very brief, this volume is poignant and thought-provoking.	2003-01-16

Lieutenant Julia Brennan is called to the scene when the naked body of a young girl is found in Central Park.  It is surmised that the girl was running away from something, but what would cause a young child to go out naked into a bitter cold night?<br /><br />Julia's horror grows as she learns what happened to this young victim, whom she calls \\"Little Girl Blue.\\"  The case becomes even more complicated when other dead bodies turn up.  Pete Foley, a cop who is desperate to find his own missing daughter, assists Julia in her investigation.  Patti Foley, Pete's daughter, was snatched five years earlier from a day care center, and Pete has not laid eyes on her since.  In an effort to find Patti, Pete has become an expert on pedophiles, and his knowledge proves to be very helpful in this investigation.<br /><br />\\"Little Girl Blue\\" is one of the most unflinching and hard-hitting police procedurals that I have read in some time.  Without being overly graphic, David Cray makes the reader care deeply about the pedophiles' helpless victims, and we strongly identify with those law enforcement professionals who track down these monsters.<br /><br />Julia Brennan is a terrific character, with seemingly contradictory personality traits.  She is hardened from a difficult childhood with an alcoholic mother, but she has retained a feeling of compassion for the underdog.  A single parent, Julia is devoted to her adolescent daughter, but she is also hoping for a promotion to a high position in the NYPD.  Cray deftly depicts Julia's growing romantic relationship with Foley, a deeply wounded individual with many unresolved issues of his own.<br /><br />Cray's dialogue and plotting in \\"Little Girl Blue\\" are on the money.  There is an immediacy about Cray's writing style that puts the reader right in the middle of the action.  His description of police procedure is superb, and the book is extremely fast-paced.

David Auburn's play, \\"Proof,\\" tackles the clear-cut vs. the unquantifiable elements of life.  Robert and his daughter, Catherine, are gifted mathematicians.  Robert was once a brilliant teacher who made groundbreaking discoveries in his field.  Tragically, he became mentally ill in his twenties and never fully recovered.  Catherine, age 25, has sacrificed her formal education, romance, and even her sense of self to care for her father and keep him out of an institution.<br /><br />When Robert dies suddenly, Catherine's older sister, Claire, flies in from New York for the funeral.  Claire is an actuary who has paid the family's bills for years, but has had little contact with her father and sister.  The two women argue bitterly about guilt, responsibility and Catherine's future.  Complicating the mix is a fourth person, Harold Dobbs, Robert's former student, who is interested both in Robert's notes and in Catherine herself.<br /><br />Auburn's play makes the point that higher mathematics is elegant and complex, but ultimately quantifiable.  A proof either works or it does not.  Life isn't like mathematics; it is messy and open-ended.  As the characters interact (including Robert in flashback), they reveal their hopes, fears, and regrets. \\"Proof\\" is intimate, intense, and raises questions for which there are no easy answers:  How much does a child owe his or her sick parent?  What responsibility do we have to ourselves?  The author implies that if we hope to be happy, find love, and experience fulfillment, we must learn to live with, if not overcome, guilt, frustration, and self-doubt.	2003-01-06

Joseph Antonelli, criminal defense attorney extraordinaire, is back in D. W. Buffa's fourth legal thriller, \\"The Legacy.\\"  Unlike Buffa's previous efforts, this novel never comes to life.  It is a slow-moving and cliche-ridden look at the corrupt practices of wealthy and amoral wheeler-dealers and politicians.<br /><br />Antonelli leaves Portland, Oregon, and travels to San Francisco to defend Jamaal Washington, a young black man accused of gunning down United States Senator Jeremy Fullerton during a robbery.  Fullerton was a ruthless and ambitious politician who had many enemies.  Antonelli is certain that Fullerton's death was no robbery; he is convinced that a political enemy assassinated the Senator.  Antonelli is determined to free the likeable Jamaal, a soft-spoken pre-med student who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br /><br />Buffa writes this book as if he were doing a painting-by-numbers.  He uses plot devices that we have seen too many times before.  Many authors have written more compellingly about political charlatans who pretend to be altruistic, but who are really self-serving and corrupt. Antonelli's character is strangely lifeless, as is his love interest, Marissa.  Neither the courtroom scenes nor the twist at the end can save \\"The Legacy\\" from being a run-of-the-mill legal thriller that is not up to Buffa's usual high standards.	2003-01-05

Susan Orlean's \\"The Orchid Thief\\" is an intriguing look at people who are obsessed with collecting orchids.  Originally, Ms. Orlean's main focus was to write a profile of John Laroche in \\"The New Yorker\\" magazine.  Laroche is an offbeat character who spent a great deal of time and money amassing a huge orchid collection.  When Laroche banded together with a group of Seminole Indians to steal orchids from the Fakahatchee Strand, a 63,000-acre preserve in southwest Florida, he was arrested and tried for his crime.<br /><br />Orlean eventually expanded her article on Laroche into this book.  She widened the scope of her research and came up with many interesting tidbits about orchids and those who collect them.  For example, I learned that orchids often outlive human beings. In fact, orchids can theoretically live forever, since they have no natural enemies.  Some orchid owners designate a person as an \\"orchid heir\\" in their wills, since the owners expect that their precious orchids will outlive them.<br /><br />The author has a delicious sense of wonder, a beautiful and lyrical writing style, and an eye for fascinating details.  She has the ability to place the reader in the middle of a swamp, at an orchid show, or on an expedition into the wilds of South America.  Not only does Orlean provide the reader with little known facts about orchids, but she also explores some of the oddities of human nature.  What causes people to become so passionate about collecting orchids that they risk their fortunes or even their lives to acquire rare species of this coveted plant?  When does a passion for collecting orchids become an unhealthy obsession?<br /><br />If you are tired of reading formulaic novels, you may want to join Susan Orlean on her exciting and memorable journey into the world of orchid collecting.  You do not have to be a plant lover, a gardener or a botanist to enjoy \\"The Orchid Thief.\\"	2003-01-01

Dr. Madison has established a thriving practice in Sacramento, California. He is wealthy and highly respected in the community. He is also blessed with a lovely wife and two beautiful children.<br /><br />Dr. Madison's life is abruptly turned upside down when he meets an emotionally disturbed woman named Brittany Harding. Ms. Harding is filling in as an administrator for an organization to help the developmentally disabled. Since his brother is developmentally disabled, Dr. Madison devotes a great deal of time to this organization. When Harding turns out to be a liability as an administrator because of her tactlessness and spiteful tongue, Dr. Madison hints that she will most likely lose her job. Harding then sets out to ruin Dr. Madison's reputation, marriage and career.<br /><br />Harding's diabolical scheme works so well that Dr. Madison is in danger of losing everything that he has worked for his entire life. His troubles reach a crescendo when he is accused of a double homicide. Only Dr. Madison's lawyer, Jeffrey Hellman, and his friend, Ryan Chandler, a forensic specialist, believe in Dr. Madison's innocence and set out to exonerate him.<br /><br />\\"False Accusations\\" offers a sympathetic protagonist, intriguing police work and lively courtroom theatrics. Jacobson succeeds in maintaining a high level of suspense throughout the novel. However, stilted dialogue and an unbelievable ending keep the book from being a first rate thriller.

David Cray's latest novel, \\"What You Wish For,\\" focuses on two investigations.  Julia Brennan, a captain in the New York City Police Department, is looking for the person who brutally murdered an elderly and wealthy widow, Adeline Rose.  At the same time, Julia's lover, an ex-cop named Peter Foley, is searching for his daughter, Patti, who was snatched from a day care center five years earlier.  Peter has spent a great deal of time infiltrating pedophile networks in an effort to get a lead on Patti's whereabouts.<br /><br />Julia is a rising star in the police department.  By tying herself to Peter, Julia may be placing her own career in jeopardy.  Peter is known as a loose cannon who will do anything to reclaim his daughter from the monster who kidnapped her.  Although Julia wants to rise high in the ranks of the NYPD, she refuses to abandon Peter, and she empathizes with his desperation to find his little girl.<br /><br />Cray's book is sharp, fast-moving and, at times, harsh.  The criminals in \\"What You Wish For\\" display some of the most reprehensible traits that humans are prone to, including betrayal, lust, greed, violence and hatred.  However, Cray tempers this negative view of humanity with his depiction of the enormous love that Julia and Peter have for one another and for their children.  It is this strong bond that has enabled the couple to weather some very difficult times.<br /><br />\\"What You Wish For\\" is a realistic and gripping thriller.  It will have you turning pages quickly to find out how the two investigations play out.  Peter Foley and Julia Brennan are vivid and intense characters, and the secondary characters are equally well drawn.  Cray's dialogue and plotting are crisp and intelligent, and he maintains a high level of suspense throughout this well-written and highly recommended novel.	2002-12-22

Jennie Fields, author of the wonderful \\"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,\\" has scored again with her touching novel, \\"The Middle Ages.\\"  Jane Larson is a forty-six year old architect, living in New York City with her rambunctious fifteen-year old twin daughters.  She is a divorced single mom who is bored with her routine job, which consists mostly of designing banks and assisted living facilities.  She longs to go out on her own and create beautiful houses, but she lacks the courage to try something new after eighteen years with the same firm.<br /><br />Although she is still attractive, Jane is no longer the lithe beauty that she was in her twenties.  She huffs and puffs going up staircases, and the days when she attracted wolf whistles are a distant memory.  She dates infrequently and has little expectation of meeting a wonderful man at her age. Jane's life is shaken up when her job situation suddenly changes drastically.  Her personal life also takes an interesting turn, when she decides to e-mail her old college flame, Jack, supposedly to catch up on old times.  Suddenly, the old feelings are rekindled, even though Jack is living far away, in Nashville, Tennessee.<br /><br />With gentle humor and compassion that is rare in novels these days, Fields explores the territory of the \\"middle ages,\\" which is often marked by fear, insecurity, loss and pain.  Jack and Jane have both been battered by life.  Are they ready to plunge into a risky relationship that could potentially bring them more heartache?  Should middle-aged people have the confidence to try new things when the very thought of change is so terrifying?  Fields's straightforward style is heartfelt and honest, and she writes as if she understands the territory of middle age very well from personal experience.  A few overly sentimental touches here and there do little to detract from this warm novel about real people hoping for a second chance at happiness.	2002-12-15

However, although I admire Tartt's attention to detail, her insightful character studies and her occasionally inventive and colorful prose, the plot is too thin to sustain such a long book. \\"The Little Friend\\" is set in a small Mississippi town.  Harriet Cleve Dufresnes was a baby when her nine-year-old brother, Robin, was found hanging dead from a tree in his front yard.  Twelve years later, Harriet's mother, Charlotte, is a wreck who sits at home most of the time in a grief-stricken stupor. Harriet's father long ago left home to start a new life.  Harriet's role models are her nanny, Ida, her overbearing grandmother, Edie, and her Aunts Tat, Libby and Adelaide.<br /><br />Harriet is both a tomboy and an avid reader with a vivid imagination.  She has decided that she will find Robin's killer and bring him to justice.  Together with her pal, Hely, Harriet embarks on a plan to set things right.  Harriet's actions put her into mortal danger, and the results of her deeds are entirely unexpected. Tartt can be brilliant and some of her writing hits just the right notes.  She describes every character to perfection, from the sarcastic and bossy Edie to the slick car salesman, Roy Dial, to the paranoid drug dealer, Farish Ratliff.  Her eye for scenic detail is marvelous and she has a flair for the dramatic.<br /><br />Where Tartt goes terribly wrong is in her plotting.  Not enough happens to keep the reader hooked for so many pages and there is little payoff to reward our patience. Harriet is a lively individual whose tough exterior hides deep feeling, but even her character becomes tedious. Tartt's themes seem to be that justice and truth are elusive and that a child's innocence is precious and easily destroyed.  However, the author does not have enough narrative juice to make her story come alive.

During the rare occasions when she is at home, Julia is tense and argumentative, and Jack suspects that his marriage may be in trouble.Only when Jack is hired as a consultant at Xymos does he discover that Julia and her colleagues are working on something that is top secret and extremely dangerous.<br /><br />For the first half of the book, Crichton does a bang-up job of creating an intriguing and frightening scenario.  Since the reader has no idea what is wrong at Xymos, Crichton drops little innuendos and subtle clues to fire up our curiosity.  By the time we get to Xymos, and Jack starts to sniff around, we are ready to be shocked by the revelations to come. Although there is gore and fright aplenty to please fans of this genre, Crichton is unable to sustain the excitement and intrigue throughout the novel.  The ending is forced and a bit silly.  There is no character development whatsover.  Crichton's didactic theme is that man must not let his arrogance lead him to overreach, lest he unleash uncontrollable forces.

His latest novel, \\"Reversible Errors,\\" has all the elements of a Greek tragedy.  Turow shows us a criminal justice system in which the legal and political stakes are high, but the moral ramifications are even higher. Not only is this book significant for its handling of important and timely themes, but it is also beautifully written and enormously entertaining.<br /><br />\\"Reversible Errors\\" is the story of Rommy \\"Squirrel\\" Gandolph, a small time thief with a low IQ, who has been sentenced to death for the murder of three people in 1991. The federal appellate court appoints a corporate lawyer and former prosecutor named Arthur Raven to \\"ensure that after ten years of litigation, no sound arguments remained to save Rommy Gandolph's life.\\" It seems unlikely that \\"reversible errors\\" were made in this case, since Rommy confessed on videotape, and none of his lawyers has ever offered a credible alternative to Gandolph being the murderer. What is originally a perfunctory duty for Arthur turns into a crusade when he becomes convinced that his client is indeed innocent. Arthur is a compassionate and sensitive person who decides that he must save Rommy if he is to live with himself.<br /><br />Turow brilliantly sets up the case for the reader by going back and forth between 1991 and 2001. We meet the ambitious prosecutor, Muriel Wynn and her lover, Larry Starczek, who is also the dogged detective on Rommy's case. One of the most fascinating and unforgettable characters in the book is the beautiful and brilliant judge, Gillian Sullivan.  Gillian sentenced Rommy to death, and she was subsequently imprisoned for misdeeds of her own. All of these people have a stake in what happens to Rommy, since they all contributed to putting him on death row.<br /><br />\\"Reversible Errors\\" works on many levels. The legal maneuverings are fascinating and instructive. The relationships between the characters are dramatic and often poignant. The dialogue is witty and intelligent.  Turow demonstrates once again that justice is an elusive commodity in a world where some lawyers, judges and police officers are not only fallible, but also power-hungry, greedy and amoral. The title, \\"Reversible Errors,\\" is not only a legal term.  It also refers to the mistakes that we all make in our personal and professional lives.  Is it ever possible to undo the past?

A thoughtful plot, a superb writing style, and excellent character development make \\"Reversible Errors\\" a top-notch legal thriller.	2002-11-24

Jan Burke's new thriller, \\"Nine,\\" is a complicated suspense novel with so many characters and such a dense plot that it may confuse the casual reader. After finishing the book, I went back to the beginning to figure out exactly what had happened and why.<br />\\"Nine\\" deals with vigilantes who have decided to kill all of the suspects on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. They methodically track down these felons, then torture and kill them. Many people across the country applaud the vigilantes, since they are catching dangerous criminals who have thus far eluded the FBI's dragnet.<br />However, Los Angeles Homicide Detective Alex Brandon does not applaud the vigilantes; he considers them to be criminals, not heroes. As Alex gets more deeply involved in the case, he finds to his horror that the perpetrators may be targeting not just wanted felons, but him, as well.<br />Although Burke is a talented writer who knows how to build suspense, \\"Nine\\" has some glaring weaknesses. The vigilantes are cardboard characters whose motivations and behavior are implausible. Most of the dialogue is stilted and the plot becomes more far-fetched as the book lumbers on to its melodramatic conclusion. At almost 400 pages, \\"Nine\\" is too long, and it goes off in too many directions. Tighter editing might have helped the book flow more smoothly. Although \\"Nine\\" does provide thrills and gore galore, I did not find it realistic or truly entertaining.	2002-11-17

Michael Connelly's new book, \\"Chasing the Dime,\\" is a big disappointment.  Not only does this thriller have an implausible premise, but its characters and plot are also poorly conceived and developed.<br />The protagonist of \\"Chasing the Dime\\" is Henry Pierce, a thirty-four year old Stanford graduate who is a brilliant and obsessive scientist.  Henry's field is chemistry, and he is involved in a highly competitive race with other companies who are on the verge of a breakthrough in the field of molecular computing.  Henry's long hours and devotion to his work have already cost him his fiancee, who walked out on him when he refused to cut back on his work schedule.<br />Henry's life takes an alarming turn when a seemingly random coincidence occurs.  His new phone number turns out to be the same as that of a gorgeous prostitute named Lilly, whose sexy picture graces a salacious Web site called L. A. Darlings.  Henry has a soft spot for fallen women, since his beloved sister, Isabelle, was a prostitute who died a horrible death.  He has always felt guilty for not saving his sister.  Now, Henry reasons, he can redeem himself by saving Lilly.<br />No matter what his unconscious motivations are, I find it difficult to believe that anyone as bright as Henry would be so naive and driven as to risk his life and his livelihood to save someone whom he has never met.  Even when he is beaten to within an inch of his life, Henry refuses to back off.  The villains in \\"Chasing the Dime\\" are stock characters and the ending is ludicrous.  The only redeeming feature in this novel is the science.  Connelly intriguingly presents the cutting-edge research in molecular electronics that will undoubtedly transform all of our lives in the future.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend \\"Chasing the Dime,\\" since it is neither a compelling nor a realistic thriller.	2002-11-10

Having read all of the previous sixteen novels in this series, I am pleased to report that \\"Quarry\\" is up there with Grafton's best.  It is witty, fast-paced and suspenseful, with a look into Kinsey's past that sheds light on her solitude and her quirky personality.<br />Kinsey Millhone, for those of you who are new to Sue Grafton, is a private investigator based in the fictional town of Santa Teresa, California.  She is thirty-seven, has had two brief failed marriages, and aside from work, her life consists mostly of jogging, eating fast food and socializing with her elderly landlord, Henry.<br />One day, Lieutenant Con Dolan, of the Santa Teresa Police Department, Homicide Division, offers Kinsey a job.  Dolan is currently on medical disability. He has had two heart attacks and he is angling for a third, being a chain smoker and a heavy drinker.  Con's friend, Stacey Oliphant, is a seventy-three year old retiree from the Sheriff's Department.  Stacey has been a cancer patient for years, and he has begun to lose hope that he will ever recover.<br />To rekindle Stacey's interest in life, Dolan decides to investigate a cold case from 1969, eighteen years earlier, on which Stacey was one of the investigating officers.  A young girl, who was never identified, was stabbed and dumped in a quarry.  No one was ever apprehended for the crime.  Dolan convinces Kinsey to help him and Stacey reopen the case and see what turns up. Kinsey is intrigued and what follows is a complex and thorough investigation, during which Dolan, Oliphant and Kinsey find out that people in small towns sometimes hide deadly secrets.<br />Grafton develops her characters very well in \\"Quarry\\".  Dolan and Oliphant are a delightfully cranky pair, and Kinsey is in fine investigative form.  The mystery is fairly straightforward, but the trail that leads to the solution is twisted indeed.  \\"Q is for Quarry\\" is a satisfying novel, with Grafton's trademark humor and wit adding some welcome lightness to a dark tale of murder and treachery.'s trademark humor and wit adding some welcome lightness to a dark tale of murder and treachery.	2002-11-03

John Grisham is certainly capable of surprising his readers.  &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is a big departure, both in theme and style, from the author's earlier works.  It is a seriocomic look at one couple's attempt to cut Christmas out of their lives for just one year.<br />Luther and Nora Krank have always pulled out all the stops for Christmas.  They always buy a beautiful Christmas tree and throw a lavish holiday party.  However, this year, Luther Krank has decided that he would rather not spend thousands of dollars on preparing for the holiday.  Instead, he decides to skip Christmas altogether.  No tree, no decorations, no donations to the police department, and no fancy party.  He and his wife will use the money that they save to take an exciting Caribbean cruise.  The Krank's neighbors are scandalized and furious, since they believe that Luther and Nora have selfishly turned their backs on sacred tradition.<br />Grisham captures the feeling of living in a small town. He shows that although the inhabitants of small towns may at times be clannish and judgmental, they can also be very kind and supportive of one another.  Luther, as his name implies, is somewhat cranky, yet he is at heart a kind and caring man.  Although Luther's wife agrees to his &quot;skipping Christmas&quot; plan, when things change, Nora shows that she has an iron will of her own.  Grisham's &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is a sweet and touching story about the true meaning of the holiday season.  The author's gentle humor and his understated message make this a delightful book that is sure to entertain readers of all ages.	2002-10-28

It captures perfectly the whine of the modern, high-powered executive (female) who wants to have it all.  What she ends up with is guilt, exhaustion, and low self-esteem.<br />Kate Reddy, the British protagonist of this trendy novel, seems to be the perfect role model.  She is a thirty-something mother with two adorable children, a loving husband, and a high-paying job as a hedge-fund manager.  She is a high-flyer in a male-dominated world.  No one knows how Kate manages to juggle all of her responsibilities, which include frequent business trips. The answer is, she can't.  Kate's kids, Emily and Ben, miss their mother terribly during her frequent absences.  Her husband, Rich, feels neglected and somewhat emasculated by Kate's tactless pronouncement that she is the \\"main breadwinner\\" in the family.<br />Pearson captures Kate's life perfectly and with great wit.  We experience Kate's exasperation when her nanny cancels at the last minute or when Kate's mother-in-law tells her pointedly that she had better start paying attention to her man.  Kate lurches from crisis to crisis, sending desperate and confessional emails to her girlfriends as a way to vent and ease her nervous tension.  We feel her pain, but we also suspect that she may eventually pay the price for her self-delusion.<br />Can Kate continue to balance work and family indefinitely, without losing her mind?  Will she succumb to the charms of a gorgeous male client who wants more from her than just business advice?  Will Rich finally force Kate to choose between him and her job?  Pearson manages to tackle all these questions with poignancy, humor and wisdom.  Her breezy writing style is a delight and I recommend that you sit back and enjoy this entertaining book by a very talented author.	2002-10-27

Ann-Marie MacDonald's &quot;Fall on Your Knees&quot; is an ambitious novel that chronicles the saga of the Piper family, who live in Cape Breton Island off Nova Scotia in Canada.  The narrative starts in 1898 and ends in the middle of the twentieth century.  It starts with eighteen-year-old James Piper's ill-fated love affair with Materia Mahmoud, a girl of twelve whose family is wealthy and powerful.  James and Materia elope, and the Mahmouds are outraged.  As the years pass, James and Materia start a family of their own, and it soon becomes apparent that the Pipers are destined to suffer.<br />MacDonald is a talented writer who experiments interestingly with the written word.  She takes off on literary flights of fancy, using interesting metaphors, magical realism and delightful humor to hold the reader's interest throughout this five hundred page epic.  The characters are uniformly well drawn.  They include Materia, the clueless matriarch, who soon realizes that she has gotten in over her head when she married James; Kathleen, the gorgeous daughter with a glorious singing voice and gigantic ambition; Mercedes, the compassionate and religious sister who tries to keep the family from falling apart after a series of devastating tragedies befall them; and the father, James, a deeply flawed individual who is responsible for many of the terrible events that wreck his family.<br />&quot;Fall on Your Knees&quot; is an account of a bizarre family dynamic. MacDonald depicts the horrible pain that people inflict on their &quot;loved ones&quot; through weakness, malice or perversity.  Ultimately, &quot;Fall on Your Knees&quot; sinks somewhat under its own melodramatic weight.  However, I still recommend that you read this unusual novel so that you can savor the sheer virtuosity of Ann-Marie MacDonald's original writing style.	2002-10-20

Rochelle Krich introduces a new character, Molly Blume, in her latest novel, \\"Blues in the Night.\\" Molly writes short features and full-length books about true crimes, and she is fascinated by one in particular. A woman named Lenore Saunders is hit by a car while wandering around in her nightgown near Laurel Canyon in California. Why was Lenore wearing a nightgown and from whom was she running? Did the driver hit Lenore on purpose or was it an accident?<br />Molly starts to dig into Lenore's background, and she find out that it is a sordid one. Lenore's ex-husband, Robbie, is a shady businessman with political aspirations and a penchant for womanizing. Lenore's mother is a cold-hearted, selfish and materialistic person, who has always put her own needs ahead of her daughter's. Lenore, unsurprisingly, has a history of psychiatric problems and a desperate need to be loved and cared for.<br />Molly Blume, on the other hand, is lucky enough to be part of a large and loving Jewish family. Divorced from her own womanizing husband, Molly finds out that Zach Abrams, a former boyfriend, is back in town. Abrams has become a rabbi, and he seems interested in picking up where he and Molly left off years ago. Molly, however, is reluctant to trust Zach, since he has hurt her once before.<br />Molly methodically starts to interview all of Lenore's family, friends and acquaintances, to see if she can unearth some clues about what really happened to Lenore. Molly is nosy and tenacious, like all good reporters, but she also has a kind heart and the ability to put people at ease. Naturally, Molly puts herself in danger by asking too many people too many questions, as she gets closer to the truth about Lenore. I recommend \\"Blues in the Night.\\" It is a workmanlike, fast-paced mystery, featuring a fresh new face in Molly Blume.	2002-10-13

Shane and Zane are six-year-olds with fetal alcohol syndrome.  Nine-year-old Billy is hyperactive and aggressive.  Eight-year-old Jesse twitches and barks as a result of his Tourette's syndrome.  The title refers to seven-year-old Venus Fox, a deeply withdrawn child from a dysfunctional family who is completely unresponsive to external stimuli.<br />Hayden vividly recounts the outrageous and often hilarious events that occur in her classroom in minute detail.  We feel her frustration and elation as she describes her efforts to transform an angry and anti-social group of students into a cohesive and functioning class.  Hayden is as unembarrassed about discussing her setbacks as she is pleased to discuss her successes. The author's honesty and realism give \\"Beautiful Child\\" an extra dimension that touches the heart.<br />The story of Venus Fox reduced me to tears.  Hayden's painstaking efforts to bring Venus out of her shell had me cheering for this child who had so many strikes against her.  I recommend \\"Beautiful Child\\" for all readers who are interested in the art of teaching children with special needs.	2002-10-10

Val McDermid's latest novel, &quot;The Last Temptation,&quot; is an ambitious undertaking.  The author crosses geographical boundaries; her plot lines involve police forces in England, Holland and Germany.  This novel also has numerous characters and several storylines that at first seem unrelated, but which eventually intersect.<br />Carol Jordan is an ambitious Detective Chief Inspector who is well trained in criminal intelligence.  Jordan has helped bring two serial killers to justice and she has paid her dues as a police officer.  Now, she is aiming for a high-level job in British intelligence and analysis, and she is expecting a promotion to come through very soon.  Much to her surprise, Jordan is not granted her promotion.  Instead she is sent into deep undercover to bring down a notorious criminal named Tadeusz Radecki and his right hand man Darko Krasic, who are based in Germany.<br />A second protagonist in &quot;The Last Temptation&quot; is Dr. Tony Hill, a psychologist who has been deeply scarred by his job of profiling serial killers.  He is now on the trail of a criminal who targets psychologists and murders them in a particularly gruesome manner.  Hill and Jordan have collaborated professionally in the past.  As they work these difficult cases, Jordan and Hill provide one another with much needed advice and emotional support.<br />McDermid handles her large cast of characters and a complex plot adroitly.  Her dialogue is crisp and her descriptive writing is vivid yet understated.  The author ratchets up the tension as the novel reaches its exciting denouement.  Unfortunately, McDermid resorts to a pat ending, which strains believability.  However, this quibble aside, I recommend &quot;The Last Temptation.&quot;  McDermid's skill as a writer of fast-paced and well-crafted thrillers makes this new novel a &quot;must-read&quot; for fans of this genre.	2002-10-06

Shortly thereafter, Julie was raped and murdered.  The prime suspect is Will's brother, Ken, who may be dead, or else he may be a fugitive from justice.  Time passes, and Will finally finds another woman whom he loves, named Sheila.  One day, Sheila suddenly takes off, and Will has no idea why she left or where she went.<br />As the drama unfolds, we gradually learn that Will knows little or nothing about what really happened eleven years ago.  Figuring prominently in the plot are two malevolent villains, one known as the Ghost and the other a Mafia type named McGuane, both boyhood friends of Ken's. The Ghost and McGuane have agendas of their own, and they are not squeamish about destroying anyone who gets in their way.<br />\\"Gone for Good\\" ultimately does not succeed because the book is too \\"busy\\" and plot-driven.  The characters are not developed satisfactorily.  Coben works so hard trying to surprise the reader with endless twists and turns that he forgets an important element of novel writing.

As the investigators race against time, the judge is facing certain death at the hands of her crazed attacker.<br />Unfortunately, \\"Unnatural Instinct\\" does not rise above the pedestrian.  The dialogue is stilted and the characters are mostly stereotypes.  Although there is a fair amount of suspense as the killer eludes his pursuers time and again, the plot is basically a recycling of many similar novels.  The only real distinction of \\"Unnatural Instinct\\" is the method that the killer uses to torture his victim.  It is a novel idea, as original as it is gruesome, and it is one that I have never encountered before.

David Spier, chief of the Emergency Room, is a compassionate doctor who prevents the police from carrying out their brand of vigilante justice.  Unfortunately, the felon, whose name is Clyde, escapes and continues his crime spree.

To redeem himself and assuage his guilt, David decides to track down the felon with the help of a shady character who is an expert at quasi-legal private investigations.  David learns that Clyde's behavior has roots that go back many years, and the doctor uses his medical knowledge to diagnose what is troubling Clyde now.  Some of his findings are shocking, and Spier winds up questioning many of the assumptions that he has held all of his life.

As a result, Ben's firm is often in the red, and the patience of his loyal and underpaid staff is sometimes strained to the breaking point.<br /><br />This time, Ben takes the case of an Episcopal priest named Father Daniel Beale, who is on trial for murdering one of his female parishioners.  Ben has known Father Beale since childhood and believes that the priest is innocent. Unfortunately, Beale has a reputation as a hothead, and he was heard threatening the victim before her death.

Although one of Bernhardt's trademarks is the amusing banter among the members of Kincaid's firm, the jokes this time around fall flat. In addition, as the book progresses, the narrative becomes increasingly far-fetched and illogical.

Butch works as the chief assistant District Attorney in New York City, where he encounters endless bureaucracy and constant political pressure from his superiors.  Marlene runs a business training guard dogs, and she is determined to avoid the violence that marked the earlier part of her life.  She has always had a penchant for trying to right wrongs, which more than once has placed her family in the line of fire.  However, Marlene has decided that the satisfaction and excitement of bringing bad guys to justice is not worth the risk to herself and her loved ones.<br />Alas, resolutions are made to be broken.  Marlene and Butch meet the Heeny family on Long Island.  The Heeneys include Rose, her volatile husband, Red, and their three children.  Red Heeney is a firebrand union agitator who is trying to clean up the corruption in the coal-mining town of McCullensburg, West Virginia.  However, Red's outspoken stand against corruption has tragic repercussions.  Before long, Dan Heeney, Red's son, calls on Marlene to come to West Virginia to help him.  Butch also gets involved in the ugly situation in West Virginia when the governor makes him a special prosecutor.  It is Butch's job to bring justice to this lawless town.<br />Tanenbaum's books all have several common threads.  The dialogue is hip and saucy, and is often laced with sarcasm and flip humor.  The prose is effortless and entertaining, and there is almost no objectionable language or gore.  His books usually deal with important social issues.  In \\"Absolute Rage,\\" Tanenbaum's effectively describes how a small town gradually becomes completely corrupt.  In McCullensburg, the mining company owns everything, including all of the elected officials.<br />The characters in \\"Absolute Rage\\" are, as always, colorful and vivid.  One of the most fascinating characters is Butch and Marlene's daughter, Lucy, who has grown up before our eyes.  She is now a student in Boston College.  Lucy has been a language prodigy for years and, unlike her parents, she is an ardent Catholic.  In this novel, she experiences her first romantic encounter.  Tanenbaum also brings back the fascinating Tran, a former guerilla fighter from Vietnam who has been a Karp family friend since the early days.<br />\\"Absolute Rage\\" has a number of predictable elements.

In Elie Wiesel's novel, \\"The Judges,\\" five airline travelers are flying en route from New York to Tel Aviv.  They are forced to land in Connecticut because of a severe snowstorm.  An apparently hospitable individual invites them to stay in his cabin until the storm subsides.  What the five passengers do not know is that their apparently kind-hearted host has a hidden agenda that is anything but benign.<br />The travelers, four men and a woman, have secrets and worries that plague them.  One of them is terminally ill, another seeks to regain memories of his earlier life, and a third carries a letter that may have serious political ramifications.  The host, who calls himself \\"The Judge,\\" starts to play a malevolent game with his guests.  He cruelly informs them that after they reveal the intimate details of their lives, the least worthy among them will die.  Also in the cabin is the Hunchback, the Judge's servant, who is a severely deformed man that the Judge took in when no one else would care for him.  The Hunchback has secret thoughts of his own that he keeps carefully hidden.<br />This slim novel (approximately 200 pages long) is filled with convoluted philosophical musings.  The travelers engage in verbal sparring matches with one another and with the Judge.  Unfortunately, none of the characters come to life, and it is unclear what the Judge, the Hunchback and the travelers are supposed to represent.  What is Wiesel trying to say about the significance of an individual's life?  I was unable to detect a coherent message in this novel. After having read Wiesel's touching and deeply meaningful works on the Holocaust, I was surprised by how unmoved \\"The Judges\\" left me.	2002-08-25

Homicide detective Jane Rizzoli, of the Boston Police Department, has horrible memories of a vicious serial killer named Warren Hoyt.  Hoyt was nicknamed \\"The Surgeon\\" because of the surgical precision with which he mutilated his female victims.  Although Hoyt is now behind bars, he left behind a legacy of shattered lives.  Rizzoli still has nightmares about her close call with death.  Her hands are scarred from the Surgeon's scalpel, and she knows that she was lucky to survive her encounter with Hoyt.<br />Suddenly, Rizzoli is called to the scene of a case that is strangely reminiscent of the Surgeon's grisly handiwork.  Rizzoli senses that Hoyt is somehow connected to this and other similar cases.  However, Rizzoli's superiors believe she lacks objectivity because of her prior connection to Hoyt.  They cannot believe that Hoyt has somehow found a way to commit murder from behind prison walls.<br />Further complicating Rizzoli's life is an FBI agent named Gabriel Dean who mysteriously appears one day in order to help the Boston PD catch this new serial killer. Dean refuses to reveal why he was called into Rizzoli's case.  Although she is physically attracted to this handsome agent, Rizzoli is also angry that the FBI is interfering in her investigation.<br />Who is this new killer and how does he pick his victims?  Are the latest killings in some way connected to the incarcerated Warren Hoyt?  Gerritsen ratchets up the suspense nicely, as the answers to these and other questions gradually unfold.  \\"The Apprentice\\" features a strong, proud female cop, Jane Rizzoli, who refuses to let anyone see her with her guard down.<br />Gerritsen explores some interesting themes in this novel, such as the weird fascination that some people have with malicious killers, and the necessity for a woman to seem as macho as her colleagues in order to survive as a homicide detective.

Clare Francis's new novel, \\"Betrayal\\" is about Hugh Wellesley, a well-to-do English businessman who is very much on edge. One reason that Hugh's nerves are frayed is that he is in danger of losing the family business that he inherited from his father. Worse still, Hugh hears that Sylvie, his former lover, has been stabbed to death. Hugh knows that sooner or later the police will question him about the crime. He does not want the police to delve into his personal life, and he wants to avoid a public scandal at all costs.<br />Hugh's fragile wife, Ginny, is an asthmatic who does not handle stress well. Soon, she is caught up in Hugh's troubles and the police start to question both Hugh and Ginny about Sylvie's death. Did Hugh or Ginny kill Sylvie? Or is there another person who had reason to want Sylvie dead?<br />Francis effectively depicts Hugh's torment and guilt over the mess that he has made of his life. Not only has Hugh neglected Ginny in order to expand a business that may now fail, but he has embroiled his wife in a homicide investigation. Even if Hugh is not charged with Sylvie's murder, he may not be able to salvage his marriage or his business.<br />\\"Betrayal\\" works much better as a character study than it does as a mystery. Hugh is basically a decent individual who has made some very costly mistakes, and Ginny is a beautiful but insecure woman who wants nothing more than to win back her husband's affections. The author depicts Hugh, Ginny and a large cast of secondary characters deftly. The lively characters are a major strength of the book.<br />Unfortunately, the mystery element of the novel is not as strong. \\"Betrayal\\" is replete with red herrings, but an astute reader should be able to figure out the solution long before the end. Nonetheless, I recommend \\"Betrayal\\" as an engrossing character study of a desperate man trying to save himself and his family from ruin.	2002-08-18

She reveals the name of a rape victim on the air and Cassie is horrified when her report causes irrevocable damage to the victim.  As a result, the victim's family is suing Cassie and her news station.  While the lawsuit is pending, Cassie is exiled to Florida as a reporter for a small-time television station, and her career is headed on a downhill spiral.  To make matters worse, Cassie's dedication to her job has put her marriage in jeopardy.  Her relationship with her husband, Jim, and her daughter, Hannah, has suffered because of the long hours that Cassie has devoted to rising up the ranks in television news.<br />After moving to Miami, Cassie faces a strong hurricane that is about to hit the coast and she is on the scene when a murderer strikes.  The murderer is a person who has killed before, and Cassie may well become one of his next targets.<br />Mary Jane Clark, former daughter-in-law of Mary Higgins Clark, has learned well from her famous relative.  \\"Nobody Knows\\" has many of the elements that make Mary Higgins Clark's books so successful.  The protagonist of \\"Nobody Knows\\" is a sympathetic and attractive woman who is beleaguered by the twists and turns of life, and she must struggle to survive.  Mary Jane Clark throws so many suspects into the mix that guessing the identity of the murderer early in the novel is an exercise in futility. What the author does best is describe the rough and tumble world of television news reporting, a topic that she knows well, since she is a producer and writer for CBS news in New York.  The author also provides some colorful background about Sarasota, Florida, home of the Ringling Brothers Museum, where part of the novel is set.<br />The book is fast-paced.  It has a great deal of dialogue plus a large cast of characters.  The most notable character is a sharp eleven-year-old named Vincent, who has a key role in the plot.

Terry McCaleb, the protagonist of Michael Connelly's \\"Blood Work,\\" had to retire in his forties from the FBI after a successful career as a profiler and tracker of serial killers.  McCaleb came down with a severe condition, caused partly by stress, which destroyed his heart.  He is alive because he received the heart of a young woman who was murdered during an apparent robbery.  Now, McCaleb lives a quiet life puttering around on in California on his houseboat and trying to stay out of the limelight.<br />Suddenly McCaleb is back in the hunt.  A woman named Graciela Rivers is the sister of Gloria Torres, whose heart was transplanted into McCaleb's chest.  Rivers approaches McCaleb and states that he has a moral obligation to look into the murder of her sister, which was never solved, and has now become a \\"cold case.\\"  Since McCaleb has Gloria's heart, Rivers reasons, he should track the person who murdered her.<br />Against doctor's orders, McCaleb launches an unauthorized investigation.  He enrages the cops who worked the Rivers case.  They do not want an ex-FBI agent who is no longer licensed to investigate their case.  McCaleb also becomes romantically involved with the beautiful Graciela and he reaches out to Torres' young son, Raymond, who was orphaned when his mother was murdered.  Eventually, McCaleb discovers that Gloria's death may not have been a random killing, after all.  A serial killer may be at work once again.<br />McCaleb is a wonderful character.  He is world-weary, compassionate, tough, and frightened, all at once.  He knows that by conducting a strenuous investigation, he is endangering his health.  However, he cannot withdraw once he is on the scent of the killer.  The investigation is complex, tedious and exhausting.  McCaleb reviews transcripts, videotapes, photographs and other evidence repeatedly, looking for any clue that will put him on the trail of the killer.  The author effectively shows how much of police work is drudgery.  McCaleb believes that there is no substitute for a thorough evaluation of evidence, and he checks everything to see what the police missed the first time around.  I like the fact that McCaleb is not too proud to ask for help from friends in the LAPD and in the FBI.<br />The dialogue and characterizations in \\"Blood work\\" are realistic and vivid, and the plot is extremely suspenseful.

I do not mind being manipulated if the book is exciting and entertaining, which \\"The Waking\\" assuredly is.<br />Will Dunby is a newspaper reporter who is married to a beautiful, wealthy and intelligent lawyer named Sandy Cross.  Sandy's family is very wealthy, while Will has had to struggle financially all of his life. On the surface, Will and Sandy appear to be a golden couple.  However, their marriage, when examined more closely, is far from perfect.  Sandy is brokenhearted over her inability to carry a baby to term, and her bitterness spills over into her relationship with Will.  After a series of ever escalating quarrels, the Dunby marriage appears to be headed for trouble.<br />To make things worse, a series of catastrophic events occur which throw Will's life into turmoil, and the rest of \\"The Waking\\" is a thrilling roller coaster ride. Not only has Nichols written a genuinely suspenseful and engrossing mystery, but he also raises fascinating moral questions about the rationalizations that people make in order to justify their questionable behavior.  The character development and dialogue are first rate and the mystery is intricate yet satisfying.  I recommend \\"The Waking\\" highly.

Clevenger is called into the case by North Anderson, a former police officer from Baltimore who is now chief of police on the beautiful island of Nantucket.  Clevenger and Anderson are former colleagues who have collaborated on some tough cases in the past.<br /><br />Clevenger is reluctant to commit himself to another forensic case, since he is still recovering from some terrible experiences that have scarred his psyche.  However, North draws him into the web of intrigue surrounding the Bishop family, and Clevenger becomes involved on many levels with the Bishop family.  Besides Darwin and the twin daughters, the Bishop family includes Julia, Darwin's gorgeous and seductive wife, and their two adopted teenaged sons, overachieving Garrett and Billy, a budding psychopath with a history of violence.<br />Everything about &#34;Compulsion&#34; is extremely intense.  It is a deeply psychosexual book which delves into the dark forces that make people do the unthinkable.  Clevenger doesn't act like a psychiatrist much of the time.  He crosses over the line into professional misconduct more than once.  Clevenger is a deeply flawed and troubled character.  He is an example of someone who becomes a psychiatrist because he wants to help himself and others who have suffered deep emotional traumas.<br /><br />As a thriller, &#34;Compulsion&#34; is fairly predictable.  Ablow throws out red herrings galore, there is a fair amount of sex and violence, and the ending has a &#34;twist,&#34; which has become almost compulsory these days.  The dialogue is serviceable, but the characters are stereotypes, except for Clevenger.  His character is the most intriguing, since he is two people at once.  On the one hand, he is a deeply compassionate and insightful psychiatrist, dedicated to healing.  On the other hand, he is something of a basket case, trying to cope with a history of alcoholism and drug abuse, and attempting to maintain his own emotional balance.<br /><br />I recommend &#34;Compulsion&#34; with reservations.

Ruth Rendell, as Barbara Vine, has again written an original and mesmerizing novel, \\"The Blood Doctor.\\"  It combines all the elements that make this author's writing so compelling.  \\"The Blood Doctor\\" has elegant prose, vivid descriptive writing, intriguing characters, a riveting plot and an ending that is both shocking and poignant.<br />Martin Nanther, a Hereditary Peer in the House of Lords, has decided to write a biography of his great-grandfather, Henry Nanther.  Henry was an expert on diseases of the blood, particularly hemophilia.  In recognition of Henry's work as one of the physicians to Queen Victoria's family, the Queen made him a lord.  This title was passed down to Henry's great grandson, Martin, now Henry's biographer.<br />Rendell interweaves details of Martin's present day life with revelations about Henry Nanther that slowly emerge throughout the novel. Martin is about to lose his peerage as part of a reform bill that will oust most hereditary peers.  More disturbing, his beloved wife, Jude, has difficulty carrying a child to term, and she consistently miscarries early in her pregnancies.  This failure to have a child is threatening Martin's and Jude's close and loving relationship.<br />Partly as a distraction from his present-day problems, Martin throws himself into detailed research of his great-grandfather's life.  Martin traces distant relatives who have saved valuable letters and notebooks.  These papers shed some light on the character of Henry Nanther.  However, they also raise some puzzling questions. Henry seems to have been many men at once.  On the one hand, he was a charming physician with a soothing bedside manner.  On the other hand, Henry was a fanatical scientist who was obsessed with blood diseases, especially hemophilia.  Henry was a devoted husband to his wife, Edith.  Yet, he was also fickle in his relationships with women.  Henry was a cold and distant father to his children.  However, when he eventually fathered a son who was deathly ill, Henry treated this son with great love and compassion.  Which of these Henrys was the real Henry?  What motivated this man to act in such contradictory ways?<br />In telling this most unusual story, Rendell probes the internal conflicts and twisted motivations that sometimes cause people to behave perversely.  She balances this with her touching portrait of Martin and Jude Nanther, whose deep love for one another is sorely tested.  Enriching this novel still more is Rendell's colorful description of life in Victorian England as well as the fascinating medical details she provides about genetics and the scourge of hemophilia.  \\"The Blood Doctor\\" proves once again that Ruth Rendell sets the standard for highly accomplished novels of psychological suspense.deathly ill, Henry treated this son with great love and compassion.

Kathy Reichs's latest novel, \\"Grave Secrets,\\" has Tempe Brennan visiting Guatemala to help the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Foundation.  Tempe is a highly skilled forensic anthropologist (like the author herself) who is helping to uncover the remains from a massacre that occurred twenty years ago in a village called Chupan Ya.  At that time, Guatemalan soldiers raped and murdered the defenseless women and children who lived there.  No records of the massacre were kept and the perpetrators were never brought to justice.  Tempe and the rest of the team want to prove that the massacre occurred and they are also attempting to identify any remains that they find.<br />This is by far the strongest and most poignant part of \\"Grave Secrets.\\"  Tempe's work in Guatemala is heartbreaking, and in light of the massacres that have occurred in so many places, all too realistic.<br />Suddenly, two members of Tempe's team are ambushed and shot, for unknown reasons.  In addition, Tempe is asked to help investigators on another case in Guatemala.  It seems that four privileged young women have mysteriously vanished.  One set of remains is found in a septic tank, and Tempe's expertise is called upon to dig out the remains and identify them.  She runs into hostility and anger from a Guatemalan District Attorney, who is angry at her \\"interference.\\"<br />Reichs writes with tremendous authority about every aspect of forensic anthropology and the first half of the book is fascinating and gripping.  The second half of the book is weaker for several reasons.  Reichs cooks up a budding romance between Tempe and a Guatemalan Special Investigator named Galiano.  Galiano happens to know Andrew Ryan, Tempe's love interest in Montreal, where she works part time.  Which man will win Tempe's heart?  This aspect of the book is cutesy and unsatisfying.  Tempe acts more like a schoolgirl than a grown woman when she is around these two men.<br />Worse, however, is the ending of the book.  After a series of red herrings, the truth is revealed about the missing girls and the present day violence in Guatemala.  The solution to the mystery is completely out of left field and extremely far-fetched. This is a shame, since Tempe is a great character, compassionate as well as strong and self-confident (except when she is around attractive men).

Alice Sebold's \\"Lovely Bones\\" is a surprising best seller, in that it deals with the aftermath of a girl's death.  In 1973, Susie Salmon is tragically raped and murdered at the age of fourteen by a serial killer.  Although Susie is dead, her spirit lives on in heaven, where she is gradually getting accustomed to her new environment.  She looks down sadly as her grief-stricken father, Jack, her mother Abigail, and her siblings, Lindsey and Buckley, try to come to terms with their horrible loss.<br />Susie longs to comfort her family.  She even brings her spirit down to earth to be near her loved ones. She aches for her father who feels her loss the most.  Susie agonizes when she sees that her parents' marriage is suffering because Jack and Abigail are unable to share their grief with one another.  Equally heartbreaking is Susie's regret at never being able to grow up and experience adult life with all of its possibilities.<br />However, as depressing as all of this sounds, there is something upbeat about \\"Lovely Bones.\\"  It is a touching exploration of the possibility that there is always some connection between the dead and the living.  Not only do our departed loved ones live on in our memories, but their spirits may be with us in a more concrete way than we realize.  Sebold also touches on other meaningful themes:  How do those who survive when their loved ones die manage to face the future with a feeling of hope? How do they achieve closure?  The author suggests that with patience and understanding, families can heal.  Human beings are surprisingly resilient.  \\"Lovely Bones\\" leaves us with the feeling that death may not really be the end, after all.	2002-07-29

The star of Lauren Belfer's debut novel, &quot;City of Light,&quot; is Buffalo, New York.  When you think of exciting cities, perhaps Buffalo doesn't spring to mind immediately.  However, Belfer's &quot;City of Light&quot; was an entirely different place in the early part of the twentieth century than it is today.  At that time, Buffalo was a hub of industry, a major port city, and a place of social ferment.  The very rich threw lavish parties and politicians who aspired to high office were careful to cultivate Buffalo's elite and influential citizens.<br />Although the novel is full of carefully researched historical tidbits, there is also a fictional story in &quot;City of Light.&quot;  Louisa Barrett is an unmarried woman in her thirties.  She is the headmistress of the Macaulay School where proper young ladies receive an enlightened education.  Louisa is a strong-willed individual with a shadowy past that she keeps carefully hidden.  She is also a devoted godmother to Grace Sinclair, who is one of her students in the Macaulay school.<br />Grace's late mother, Margaret, was Louisa's closest friend.  Grace's father, Tom, is a controversial figure who uses Niagara Falls to generate electricity, and there are those who resent Sinclair's exploitation of nature to make huge profits for both himself and the titans of industry. Is Tom Sinclair a megalomaniac or a visionary?  Is hydroelectric power the wave of the future or a selfish use of nature for man's enrichment?  These are some of the issues that Belfer raises.<br />Belfer weaves many other historical strands into this 500 plus page novel.  She discusses the plight of African-Americans and women at the turn of the century.  She shows how industrialization was a two-edged sword.  The Robber Barons got rich, but the poor lived in squalor and they were sometimes maimed or lost their lives working in unsafe factories and industrial plants.<br />For a first novel, &quot;City of Light&quot; is an astonishing accomplishment.

In a departure for him, Evan Hunter (also known as Ed McBain), has written a domestic drama, \\"The Moment She Was Gone.\\"  It is the story of a family in crisis because one of its members is schizophrenic.<br />Annie Gulliver has always been a beautiful, vibrant and intelligent individual.  She and her twin brother, Andrew, are extremely close, and Andrew thinks that he knows and understands Annie more than anyone.  However, after exhibiting alarming behavior changes over a period of years, Annie disappears one day, and no one knows where she has gone.<br />In a series of flashbacks, Hunter shows Annie's behavior becoming increasingly erratic.  She drops out of school and, financed by her mother, Annie travels all over the world. She has outlandish experiences, some real and others, the products of an increasingly delusional mind.  During a trip to Sicily, Annie claims that she was attacked. After retaliating against her \\"attacker,\\" Annie is arrested and subsequently institutionalized.  Her psychiatrist diagnoses her as schizophrenic and Andrew travels to Italy to take Annie home.<br />Although the twins' brother Aaron and his wife, Augusta, believe that Annie needs psychiatric help, it takes years for Andrew and his mother to acknowledge that Annie is seriously ill.  They chalk up her bizarre behavior to eccentricity.  Only after the evidence of her illness is incontrovertible, do they finally take responsibility for getting Annie the help that she so desperately needs.<br />This is a very sad picture of a dysfunctional family in denial.  Unfortunately, \\"The Moment She Was Gone\\" does not coalesce into a compelling story.  Hunter's novel rambles as he goes back and forth in time, describing Annie's troublesome statements and her bizarre actions, as well as her family's reactions to the changes in her.  This makes for a rather flimsy story.<br />I would recommend this book mostly for people who are interested in fiction dealing with how individuals and families suffer as a result of this tragic illness.  Although \\"The Moment She Was Gone\\" is a decent character study and it addresses an extremely important subject, it is unlikely to appeal to a wide range of readers.uffer as a result of this tragic illness.

In Greg Iles's new supernatural thriller, \\"Sleep No More,\\" John Waters is a geologist and devoted family man who lives in Natchez, Mississippi. John searches for oil wells and he has been fairly successful in the past. He is also a devoted husband and he adores his seven-year-old little girl, Annelise.<br />John's predictable life is about to change dramatically. A sultry real-estate agent named Eve Sumner moves into town, and she starts paying John a great deal of attention. Much to John's shock, Eve knows all about his sordid secrets, including every intimate detail about the tempestuous and destructive affair that John had with the gorgeous Mallory Candler many years ago. Mallory and John were sexually obsessed with one another. Although Mallory was a beauty queen, crowned \\"Miss Mississippi,\\" she was never happy. She suffered from serious psychological problems, including pathological and uncontrollable jealousy, and a tendency to become violent when thwarted. John's affair with Mallory ended badly, and both John and Mallory married other people. John is confident that this tragic chapter in his life is over forever.<br /><br />Suddenly a series of strange events catapults John and his family into a surreal and supernatural world, one in which nothing is at it seems on the surface. His past comes back to haunt him and he fears that he may lose everything that he cares about.<br /><br />\\"Sleep No More\\" has its powerful moments. It is a highly erotic novel, filled with sexual and dramatic tension. Unfortunately, the novel's plot line depends on a huge suspension of disbelief and as the book reaches its melodramatic conclusion, the events in the book become more and more far-fetched. The characters are not particularly well-developed, and \\"Sleep No More\\" is more plot-driven than character-driven. It is also reminiscent of other novels with a similar supernatural twist. However, Iles is a competent storyteller and I found myself getting caught up in the characters' myriad problems. I think that most readers will be curious to see how John Waters and his family survive the troubles that suddenly engulf them. \\"Sleep No More\\" is a modestly successful thriller.

Having recently seen the marvelous movie \\"About a Boy,\\" I decided to pick up the novel that inspired the film.  I was not disappointed.  Nick Hornby's clever, original and touching book goes to heart of how important it is to connect with other people.<br />Will Freeman, the anti-hero of \\"About a Boy\\" is not an admirable individual.  Will does not work for a living. He lives in a beautiful house in London and his expensive lifestyle is paid for by the royalties that Will receives from an ever-popular song, \\"Santa's Super Sleigh.\\"  Will's father wrote this ditty many years ago, and he never had another hit in his life. Although Will is thoroughly sick of the song, it pays the bills, since countless individuals and musical groups have recorded it over the years.  Since Will has nothing meaningful to do, he spends his time shopping, watching television, listening to music, taking recreational drugs, and chasing beautiful women.<br />Through a convoluted series of events, Will meets Marcus, a nerdy twelve-year-old with a depressive and smothering mother, named Fiona.  In spite of Will's determination to stay aloof from long-term commitments, he begins to care about Marcus and he tries to teach the boy how to be accepted by his peers.  Marcus, in turn, teaches Will how to care about someone other than himself.<br />Hornby's smooth writing style, his deft characterizations, and his subtle humor make \\"About a Boy\\" a smart and entertaining novel on several levels.  Hornby's book is not only a poignant story about lonely people connecting with one another.  It is also a social commentary about the shallowness of some aspects of modern society.  To some people, one must have the right CD's, wear the right clothes, and know the right people in order to be accepted.  Merely being a kind and loving individual is just not enough.  Without being in the least cloying or heavy-handed, Nick Hornby shows that meaningful relationships are what life is all about.	2002-07-21

Having loved the movie &quot;About a Boy,&quot; based on Nick Hornby's book, I decided to pick up the author's latest novel, &quot;How to Be Good.&quot; I was surprised at how diffuse and shallow it turned out to be.  Although there are some clever lines here and there, &quot;How to Be Good&quot; fails to coalesce into a coherent whole, and the characters never come to life.  What a shame.<br />Dr. Katie Carr considers herself to be a fairly good person.  She works in a North London clinic, helping the poor and the mentally ill, and she believes in all the &quot;right things.&quot;  She is a liberal and a feminist, she is tolerant of people who are different from her, and she is basically a nice person.  Katie has two children, Tom and Molly, whom she loves very much.<br />However, one day, she realizes that she no longer wants to be married to her husband, David.  David has little visible means of employment.  He writes a mean and sarcastic column for the local paper, and he is working on a novel that will never be published.  Katie's passion for David is tepid at best, and she thinks that their marriage has gone stale.  She has been having a clandestine affair and she thinks that she may want to divorce David and start over.<br />Before the divorce papers are even filed, David undergoes a miraculous transformation.  He meets a guru named GoodNews, who not only cures David of his back problems, but who teaches David that the way to &quot;be good&quot; is to give away your possessions and make the homeless part of your everyday life.<br />Thanks to David's sudden epiphany, the Carr family's lives are turned upside down, and David is suddenly asking people on his block to have homeless people live with them in their spare bedrooms.  David even gives away some of his family's possessions to needy people.  Unfortunately, he doesn't tell his family that he has done this until after the fact.<br />If all this seems rather dour rather than amusing, it is.  The funny lines that pepper the book do not take away from the thin character development and the overall pointlessness of the book.  Is Katie's marriage worth saving?  Do we all have an obligation to take care of the outside world when our own families need a great deal of attention?  What does it take to &quot;be good?&quot;  Hornby doesn't give any coherent answers to this question, nor does he given a good reason for asking the question in the first place.  It seems self-evident that how to &quot;be good&quot; is a subjective decision that every individual must make for himself or herself.  I do not recommend &quot;How to Be Good.&quot;  Its occasional cleverness does not make up for the thin plot and the often irritating characters and dialogue.that pepper the book do not take away from the thin character development and the overall pointlessness of the book.

Lee Child's latest novel, \\"Without Fail,\\" is a top-notch action-adventure novel that will delight Lee Child's established fans and earn him some new ones.  \\"Without Fail\\" features Jack Reacher, the formidable ex-military man who answers to no one but himself.  Reacher can be deadly or compassionate and a more appealing mythic hero would be hard to find.<br />This time around, M. E. Froelich asks Jack to help her protect the Vice President elect of the United States, Brook Armstrong.  Froelich is in charge of the Secret Service detail that is assigned to keep Armstrong safe as he travels around the country.  Of late, Armstrong has received a series of threatening letters from an anonymous source. Froelich was in love with Jack's late brother, Joe Reacher, who died tragically in the line of duty, and she knows that Jack is a terrific investigator with a sharp mind and unerring instincts.  Froelich wants to be certain that there are no gaps in the security that she is providing for Armstrong and she believes that Reacher is the man who can help her.  He agrees and he brings on board a former military associate, a woman named Frances Neagley, who is  now a security consultant in Chicago.  Neagley is as well trained and as sharp as Jack himself, and she and Jack make a great team.<br />Reacher and Neagley put their heads together to answer some tough questions.  Who is threatening Brook Armstrong and why?  Does someone have a personal vendetta against the Vice President elect? Or is the perpetrator a disgruntled individual who has a grudge against the Secret Service or perhaps against Froelich herself?  Reacher and Neagley call upon all of their considerable investigative resources as they consult with representatives of both the Secret Service and the FBI to track down the killer or killers before they carry out their threats.  During the investigation, Froelich and Reacher find that they are attracted to one another. This adds another complication to an already tense situation.<br />Child's novel is fast-paced and entertaining.  As always, his details about firearms and investigative procedure add authenticity and background color to the plot.  The characters are all finely drawn, and Reacher has never been so commanding and astute as he is in \\"Without Fail.\\"  The denouement of the book is both surprising and unpredictable.  In every way, \\"Without Fail\\" delivers the goods.  It is an action-packed thriller that will have you turning pages quickly to see how the situation will play out.

Lawyer Sheldon Siegel's first novel, &quot;Special Circumstances,&quot; is reminiscent of the best work of William Bernhardt.  Both authors leaven their plot lines with ample doses of humor and sarcasm.  They poke fun at the arrogant, the pompous and the greedy in the judicial and political communities.<br />The protagonist is Mike Daley, ex-priest and ex-public defender.  Mike has just been let go from Simpson and Gates, one of San Francisco's most prestigious and wealthiest law firms.  Mike is starting his own practice with his ex-wife, Rosie, with whom he gets along fine as long as they are no longer married.<br />Soon, Mike has a high-profile case on his hands.  He is defending Joel Friedman, a lawyer and Mike's best friend, who is charged with double homicide.  An unknown assailant murdered two lawyers, Bob Holmes and Diana Kennedy, late at night in the offices of Simpson and Gates.  The murders took place while a multi-million dollar deal was being negotiated that could make or break the firm.  The deaths were clumsily made to look like a murder/suicide.  Unfortunately for Joel, there is a great deal of circumstantial evidence that points to him.<br />Siegel has a large cast of characters, all of whom he depicts vividly and entertainingly.  There are the sleazy, lying corporate lawyers, the bitter soon to be ex-wife of the deceased, the politically ambitious and smarmy DA and the savvy no-nonsense judge.  Siegel explains the complicated legal maneuverings smoothly and clearly and the courtroom scenes are well done.<br />There are a few weaknesses in this novel.  At over five hundred pages, it is a bit too long.  In addition, the ending is somewhat melodramatic and far-fetched.  However, these flaws do not detract from the novel as a whole.  &quot;Special Circumstances&quot; is a fascinating legal thriller with enough wit and smarts to make this a very impressive debut novel.	2002-07-08

Without preaching, Ray manages with gentle humor to say quite a bit about what makes a relationship work and how difficult it is to keep a relationship viable.<br />Caroline and Tom McSwain have been married for forty-two years, and they are still very much in love.  They have four grown children, one of whom has just become engaged to a very wealthy man.  Kay, the newly engaged daughter, is so caught up in the excitement of her engagement that she has forgotten to mention one small detail to her mother.  Kay may still be in love with a lawyer named Jack, with whom she has had a passionate love affair.  Into the mix comes Taffy, Caroline's younger sister, who has been dumped by her husband, Neddy.  Taffy is a beautiful but egocentric woman, who has never been particularly close to Caroline.  However, during this time of crisis, she turns to Caroline for comfort and emotional support.  Taffy manages to throw the McSwain household into an uproar with her theatrical manner and her excitable dog, Stamp.  Stamp loves to bark loudly and bite painfully, not necessarily in that order.<br />Jeanne Ray's characters are lively and amusing.  I enjoyed Woodrow, the contractor who is helping to rebuild part of the McSwain's crumbling house.  During his long association with Caroline and Tom, Woodrow has practically become a member of the family.  Not only does Woodrow train the dog, Stamp, to curb his violent impulses, but he also dispenses wise advice and helps Taffy come out of her funk.  The title \\"Step Ball Change\\" comes from the world of tap dance.  Both Caroline and Taffy know how to dance well, and Caroline teaches tap in her own studio.  She considers tap-dancing therapeutic and a great way to express one?s feelings.  Ray implies that if people lived their lives with the same self-discipline yet freedom of expression that tap dancing generates, their lives would be much more fulfilled.  When the author writes about dancing, her prose sings.<br />Like Elinor Lipman, who also writes light romantic comedies, Jeanne Ray whimsically mixes and matches characters romantically, until all of the many complications finally sort themselves out.

Alex McNight, the former Detroit cop who lives a reclusive life in Paradise, Michingan, is back in \\"North of Nowhere,\\" by Steve Hamilton.  McNight has kept to himself a great deal lately.  His good friend, Jackie Connery, proprietor of the Glasgow Inn, decides that Alex needs to get out more.  Jackie invites Alex to play poker at the home of Win Vargas, a very wealthy man with a great many secrets.  The evening ends disastrously, when Vargas's home is invaded by masked men who rob Vargas and vandalize his prized collection of artifacts.<br />Subsequently, several of Alex's friends who sat in on the poker game are arrested for being involved in the home invasion and Alex decides to do a little investigating of his own.  He crosses paths with his old partner, private investigator Leon Purdell, who now works for Vargas.  He also has words with his old nemesis, Police Chief Roy Maven, who hates Alex and would welcome any opportunity to arrest him.<br />In the course of his investigation, Alex gets beaten and shot at, but he is determined to get to the bottom of the strange goings-on around him.  Who is really behind the robbery of Vargas's home and why are Alex's friends being framed?<br />Steve Hamilton has a relaxed prose style that is easy to take, and \\"North of Nowhere\\" moves along quickly.  I have always liked Alex, who is down to earth and businesslike in his approach to life.

In \\"North of Nowhere,\\" Steve Hamilton demonstrates how greed and selfishness often blind people to what truly matters in life.  It is a sad lesson that is often learned the hard way.<br />Hamilton's description of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is, as usual, colorful, and the dialogue is natural and fast moving.

Ayelet Waldman had a great idea when she came up with the idea for the \\"Mommy-Track\\" mysteries. The main character in this series is Juliet Applebaum, an attorney who has decided to be a stay-at-home mom. Between wiping up the assorted messes that her two toddlers are constantly making, ferrying her kids to school and playdates, and tending to her other assorted \\"mommy duties,\\" Juliet solves murders. What has made this series enjoyable thus far is that Juliet is usually witty and self-deprecating and the mysteries have been fun.<br />Unfortunately, \\"A Playdate with Death,\\" as brief as it is (a bit over 200 pages and undersized ones at that), is a chore to read. Gone is the humorous and easy-to-take Juliet, whose wisecracks are not particularly funny in this novel. Waldman has churned out a formulaic and labored mystery about the death of Juliet's personal trainer, Bobby Katz. Bobby appears to have shot himself, but Juliet suspects that he was murdered. Bobby was an easygoing guy who did not seem to be at all suicidal, and for some reason, Juliet feels compelled to solve the mystery herself.<br />In the course of her investigation, Juliet barges in on all of Bobby's friends and relatives, including both the parents who adopted him and his birth mother. One of the ridiculous conventions of this type of book is that Juliet has no standing at all in this investigation. She is not a private detective, she is not a police officer and she is not even related to Bobby. Since the police have ruled that Bobby's death is a suicide, the case has officially been closed. Yet, Juliet manages to pry information out of an assortment of people who do not have to say one word to her. Yet, of course, they give her all of the information that she needs to solve the crime.<br />Juliet's long suffering husband, Peter, puts up with her shenanigans, even though she is endangering both herself and her family with her \\"investigations.\\" The formulas and conventions wouldn't bother me if the mystery itself were at all entertaining. Unfortunately, there is nothing compelling about this case nor is the uncovering of the murderer's identity particularly suspenseful or believable. If Waldman wants to get back on track, she needs to bring back the truly humorous Juliet Applebaum and she needs to craft a mystery with a little more bite and substance.ystery itself were at all entertaining.

Jillian Hayes, Carol Rosen and Meg Pesaturo belong to \\"The Survivors Club,\\" a group of three women living in Providence, Rhode Island, who meet regularly after having been victimized by the same rapist.  Jillian, the de facto leader of the group, lost her beloved younger sister, Trisha, at the hands of the rapist.  The criminal then savagely beat Jillian when she unwittingly walked into her sister's apartment after the rapist had attacked and killed Trisha.  Jillian, Carol and Meg still bear the emotional scars of their encounters with the man who robbed them of their security and their peace of mind.<br />After putting a great deal of pressure on the police and airing their case in the media, the members of the Survivors Club are gratified when a suspect, Eddie Como, is arrested for the rapes.  DNA evidence found at all the crime scenes appears to prove conclusively that Como is the rapist, although he insists that he is innocent.  The case is blown wide open, however, when Como is gunned down by a hired killer on the day that his trial is about to begin.<br />Detective Sergeant Roan Griffin of the Providence State Police is brought into the case after having been off the force for a year.  He had suffered a meltdown after the death of his beloved young wife, and after he discovered that his next door neighbor and friend was both a pedophile and a serial killer.  Griffin joins forces with the local police to reopen the investigation of the rapes and to find out who paid to have Como killed.  Could one or all of the members of the Survivors Club have paid a killer to murder Eddie Como?  As Griffin's investigation continues, he discovers that this case is far more complicated than anyone has previously realized.  Griffin is also drawn to Jillian Hayes, a beautiful and vulnerable woman who has built a shell around herself since Trisha's death.<br />Lisa Gardner has written a satisfying thriller with wonderfully drawn characters and plenty of twists and turns.  The author effectively describes the terrible psychological effects of rape on both the victims and their families.  Gardner sympathetically portrays the difficulty of carrying on with one's life after suffering a severe trauma.  The mystery is well handled, and Gardner, for the most part, avoids the melodramatic touches that have marred her books in the past.  I recommend \\"The Survivors Club\\" highly.

Thirty-one year old Micky Ascherfeld, the heroine of &quot;Cold Heart,&quot; has had a hard-luck life.  Her parents were murdered during a robbery in their florist shop, and Micky has always felt guilty for hiding during the robbery instead of trying to save her mother and father.  Years later, Micky becomes a cop in the Houston PD, and she is once again traumatized when Wade Smith, her lover and partner, is brutally murdered.<br />In an attempt to bring some sanity back into her life, Micky drops out of civilization and takes up residence in a remote Alaskan town named McRay.  There she pursues the art of making stained glass, which she sells, and life seems serene.<br />Unfortunately, for Mickey and the other residents of McRay, a psychotic and cold-blooded misfit named El (short for Eldred) begins a killing spree and he is determined to wipe out the residents of McCray before the day is over.<br />In his debut novel, Chandler McGrew has written a taut and frightening thriller.  The brief chapters, understated writing style and quick pacing all contribute to the high level of tension, which builds as the killer proceeds on his deadly rampage.  The action scenes are horrifying and gory. McGrew uses the Alaskan landscape nicely to create a claustrophobic atmosphere and a feeling that escape may be impossible.<br />The main weaknesses of the book are the thin characterizations (El's behavior is not satisfactorily explained) and in the implausible surprise that McGrew throws in at the end.  However, throughout most of the novel, &quot;Cold Heart&quot; does deliver genuine thrills and it will keep you on the edge of your seat, wondering who will survive in McCray when the &quot;killing day&quot; finally ends.	2002-06-16

It is the story of three very different women who have one thing in common.  A handsome and charming rogue named Jeff Leach romances them and subsequently abandons them with no explanation.  As his last name implies, Jeff is very much a leech.  He takes advantage of women by living off them financially until he decides to move on to his next conquest.<br />In this novel, Rendell creates some extremely dysfunctional characters.  Yet, no matter how strange or unlikable the characters are at first glance, the author manages to make the reader both understand and sympathize with them. Most dysfunctional of all is Minty Knox, a pathetic and lonely young woman who has a horrible case of obsessive-compulsive disorder.  She is compelled by her illness to wash herself, her clothing and her home many times daily; her fear of dirt is pathological.  Worse yet, Minty eventually starts to hallucinate, seeing and hearing ghosts of people whom she has known in the past.  There is also a strange couple, Michelle and Matthew Jarvey, who suffer from extreme eating disorders and an ambitious Member of Parliament named Jims Melcombe-Smith, whose is willing to go to desperate lengths to keep his homosexuality a secret.<br />The lives of these people and others intersect when two bizarre murders are committed in London in close succession.  The police cannot decide who had the means or the motive to commit these strange crimes, but the reader is in on the secret all along.  Therefore, \\"Adam and Eve\\" is not so much a whodunit as it is an intricate, suspenseful and fascinating psychological study of the different ways that people behave under extreme duress.  It would be fair to state that Rendell's view of human nature is generally a negative one, since she so often depicts selfish, petty and disturbed people in her novels.  However, Rendell tempers her pessimism with delicious humor and deep compassion. Occasionally, as in the case of Michelle and Matthew Jarvey, Rendell creates characters who treat one other with genuine consideration and devotion.  The whole spectrum of human nature is on display in Rendell's novels.<br />I highly recommend \\"Adam and Eve and Pinch Me.\\"  It is a wonderful book that will mesmerize, horrify and entertain you all at once.Occasionally, as in the case of Michelle and Matthew Jarvey, Rendell creates characters who treat one other with genuine consideration and devotion.

Anne Murphy, the main character in \\"Courting Trouble,\\" moved from Los Angeles to Philadelphia to join the all-female law firm of Rosato & Associates.  Although Anne is beautiful, bright and ambitious, she is not particularly happy. She has few friends in Philadelphia and she has been estranged from her mother for many years.<br />Anne soon discovers that her past is about to catch up with her, since she has a secret that haunts her constantly.  While she was living in Los Angeles, Anne met a man named Kevin Satorno who professed to be in love with her.  Kevin's \\"love\\" turned into obsession, and he started calling Anne constantly and stalking her.  Eventually, when Anne refused his advances, Kevin threatened her with a gun.  Fortunately for Anne, a passerby heard her screams, and Kevin was apprehended and sent to prison for aggravated assault. In an attempt to put the past behind her, Anne has moved to Philadelphia to start a new life.  Unfortunately, Kevin is now out of prison and he is coming after Anne once again.  An attempt is made on Anne's life, and although she survives, someone is else is killed in her stead.<br />For a while, everyone thinks that Anne is dead.  Should Anne pretend to be dead so that she can consider her options?  Should she go to the police and enlist their help?  Or should she ask her colleagues at Rosato & Associates to help her catch Kevin before he finds out that she is still alive?<br />Lisa Scottoline, the author of \\"Courting Trouble,\\" is an enormously talented writer, as she proved in her wonderful novel, \\"The Vendetta Defense.\\"  However, she stumbles badly here.  Scottoline attempts to keep the tone lighthearted and amusing throughout the book, but the \\"Nancy Drew\\" antics of Anne and her friends at the law firm are lame and hare-brained.  There are no interesting police procedural matters or courtroom theatrics to liven up the proceedings.<br />In addition, although the main characters are likable enough, they are undeveloped and the plot is run-of-the-mill.  The denouement of this \\"thriller\\" is flat and improbable.  A romance is thrown in, but even this does not give the book the lift that it needs.  Scottoline makes the point that people need friends to support them in times of trouble, and that we all should try to stay connected to members of our family.  Certainly, these are important messages that most people would endorse, but they are delivered in a heavy-handed manner that weakens the book.<br />\\"Courting Trouble\\" is a trifle.

In Peter Clement's \\"Critical Condition,\\" Dr. Kathleen Sullivan suffers a brain hemorrhage and spends most of the book flat on her back, unable to move or to communicate normally.  Her lover, Dr. Richard Steele, Chief of ER, is heartbroken, especially since his first wife died after a battle with cancer.  Will Richard once again lose a woman he loves?  Even if Kathleen survives, will she ever be able to function normally again?<br />There is a great deal more at stake here, however, than Kathleen's medical problems.  There are a number of doctors in New York City Hospital who are engaged in unauthorized research that could revolutionize the treatment of a variety of medical conditions, including heart failure and strokes.  When Kathleen, without her consent, becomes a guinea pig in this new research, she cannot easily communicate her terror to Richard or to the police.  Complicating matters still further, there is a homicidal maniac on the loose, and he is targeting those very doctors engaged in this new research.<br />Although the plot of \\"Critical Condition\\" is extremely convoluted, Clement manages to hold the reader's interest with crisp dialogue and fast-paced action.  There is plenty of gore here, as people are dispatched in extremely messy ways.  One of Clement's strengths is his talent for explaining arcane scientific concepts, and his information about stem cell research is fascinating.  Another plus is Clement's restraint in not making either of his heroes, Kathleen or Richard, super-detectives.  Instead they are portrayed as vulnerable people, whose medical knowledge does not protect them from the evil that surrounds them.  Finally, Clement wisely shows that there is a moral gray area surrounding controversial scientific research.  Do the potential benefits that may result from stem cell research offset the moral questions that such research raises?  Does the United States government handcuff its scientists too much with restrictive rules, or are these rules designed to protect us all from dangerous and untested practices?  These are valid questions, which are intelligently addressed.  Clement gives no pat answers; he allows the reader to make his own judgments concerning these thorny issues.<br />What weaken the book are the stereotypical villains and the melodramatic scenes at the end of the novel when the mastermind is finally revealed.  Clement makes one huge error.  He kills off so many people that it is fairly easy to figure out who the main villain is by the process of elimination.  However, for medical thriller junkies, \\"Critical Condition\\" does provide plenty of excitement, action and scientific food for thought.s designed to protect us all from dangerous and untested practices?

Aaron Elkins once again mines the subject of the Holocaust in his new suspense novel, \\"Turncoat.\\"  The year is 1963.  Pete Simon, an associate professor of history at Brooklyn College, has been blissfully married to his French wife, Lily, for seventeen years.  Pete thinks that he knows his wife well, but he soon discovers that Lily is keeping some shocking secrets about her past.  Lily's father, Marcel Vercier, whom she claimed had died many years ago, turns up one day on her doorstep, very much alive.  Shortly thereafter, Monsieur Vercier is murdered and Lily disappears.<br />It turns out that both Lily and her father have much to hide about their activities during the Nazi occupation of France. Pete spends much of the book traveling to Spain and France in order to unearth the truth about what Lily and Vercier really did during the war years.  Pete endangers his life as he tangles with a corrupt businessman, former members of the French Resistance, a French Inspector and even some Corsican bandits.  Pete learns that the Nazi occupation was a moral litmus test that proved very challenging to the natives of France living under this oppressive regime. He also discovers that the fallout from those horrible years still has major repercussions even after all this time.<br />The writing in \\"Turncoat\\" is somewhat simplistic.  The protagonist, Pete, is an underwritten character, whose blind love and faith in Lily is unrealistic given the lies that she has fed her husband throughout their marriage.  The tone of the book is seriocomic; the many humorous passages in this book seem designed to provide comic relief as a counterpoint to the serious nature of Pete's discoveries.  However, this mixture of comedy and tragedy is occasionally jarring.  In addition, the denouement of the book is too pat and contrived.  Given the importance of the moral issues that Elkins raises in this book, he should have made his plot more coherent and realistic, instead of settling for a superficial treatment of a very serious subject.l treatment of a very serious subject.	2002-05-29

Clara Rinker is back in John Sandford's latest thriller, \\"Mortal Prey.\\"  She is the deadliest female assassin that I have ever encountered in fiction.  Not only is Rinker a whiz with firearms, but she can also outmaneuver the FBI and the police with ease.<br />Rinker has spent a good part of her life killing people for money.  After years of plying her trade, she has accumulated more than enough cash to retire and she has decided to settle down in Mexico with the man she loves.  However, a sudden act of violence changes Rinker's plans and she is back in the business of killing once again. She decides to take revenge on the people whom she believes ruined her one chance at happiness and the cops are desperate to stop her before she wreaks any further havoc.<br />The FBI calls in Lucas Davenport, a Deputy Chief in the Minneapolis Police Department, to help track down Rinker.  Davenport has dealt with her before and he was lucky to have survived the encounter.  Davenport is currently planning his wedding, but he leaves his pregnant fianc&eacute;e back in Minneapolis and joins in the hunt for Rinker.<br />\\"Mortal Prey\\" is a repetitious series of vignettes in which Rinker plies her trade, always staying one or two steps ahead of the cops.  The supposedly skilled team of FBI agents and cops who are after Rinker are completely outmatched by her superhuman intellect and daring. Rinker doesn't come across as a human being.  She is a killing machine with ice in her veins.  \\"Mortal Prey\\" is filled with violent encounters between the killer and her victims and there really is no contest between Rinker and the cops.  She is simply too good at what she does.  This throws the book way off balance.  A good hunter/prey book has a little more balance between the combatants.<br />The characterizations are thin and the plot veers from one place to another with very little coherence.  Davenport is a likeable enough protagonist, but he has very little to do other than try to figure out where and how Rinker will strike next.  \\"Mortal Prey\\" doesn't work because the criminal is simply too deadly to be true and the book drags on long after it should have reached its inevitable conclusion.here and how Rinker will strike next.  \\"Mortal Prey\\" doesn't work because the criminal is simply too deadly to be true and the book drags on long after it should have reached its inevitable conclusion.	2002-05-26

David Morrell's \\"Long Lost,\\" is about Brad and Karen Denning, a happily married couple who live with their eleven-year-old son, Jason, in Denver, Colorado. Brad is a prosperous and well-known architect. He has received favorable magazine and television coverage praising the innovative structures that he has built. Brad has one major regret in life. When he was a thirteen-year-old youngster in Ohio, he once told his nine-year-old brother, Petey to go home by himself, since Brad's friends didn't want a little kid tagging along with them.  Tragically, Petey got on his bike, pedaled away, and disappeared off the face of the earth.  Petey's disappearance devastated the Denning family and Brad has never gotten over his grief and his guilt over the loss of his brother.<br /><br />One day, a man shows up out of the blue and calls out Brad's name while Brad is walking along the street in downtown Denver.  The man states that he had seen a television spot featuring Brad, and he insists that he is Petey, Brad's long-lost brother.  \\"Petey\\" claims to be elated to have the opportunity to reconnect at last with his family and he seems anxious to make up for all the lost years when the brothers were separated. After an initial period of understandable skepticism, Brad buys the man's story, particularly because \\"Petey\\" knows facts about the boys' childhood that no one else could have told him.<br /><br />Brad soon finds that he has inadvertently plunged himself and his family into a morass of terror and despair by allowing this man into his home.  Is this man really Brad's long-lost brother, or is he an impostor?  What soon becomes clear is that \\"Petey's\\" agenda is not about reconciliation.  Brad is soon put into a position of having to single-handedly save his family and himself from disaster.<br />Morrell's writing in \\"Long Lost\\" is simple and understated.  The chapters are brief and he uses the first person, which makes the action more personal and immediate. The novel is fast-paced and exciting and the reader is kept on the edge of his seat wondering how the plot will resolve itself.

Susan Sloan, in her latest novel, \\"Act of God,\\" courageously tackles some enormously painful, sensitive and controversial issues.  She deals with the bombing of a clinic where abortions are performed, and she graphically portrays the devastating consequences of this horrendous act.  She also touches upon how the issue of abortion is cynically manipulated by both pro-life and pro-choice groups as a way to gain both publicity and political power.  However, \\"Act of God\\" is not merely a polemic in the guise of a novel.  It is one of the most exciting, suspenseful and \\"edge-of-your-seat\\" legal thrillers that I have read in years.<br /><br />Dana McAuliffe is a partner in a prestigious Seattle law firm, and she is given the task of defending Corey Dean Latham, a young naval officer who has been arrested for the bombing of the Seattle Family Services Center.  Although Dana worries that the pressure and the controversy surrounding this high-profile trial will adversely affect her both personally and professionally, she takes the case.  Little does she know that the Latham trial will test her legal expertise and have devastating consequences for her and her family.<br /><br />Although \\"Act of God\\" is over five hundred pages, Sloan's pacing is impeccable.  The author deftly sets up her large cast of characters, including the bombing victims, lawyers, judge, and members of the jury.  By providing glimpses into the minds and the hearts of the various principles in the case, Sloane imbues her story with great human interest.  \\"Act of God\\" is a sharply written, timely and engrossing work of fiction.	2002-05-12

She is determined that the man responsible for killing her sister remain behind bars, instead of being released on parole after spending nearly twenty-two years in prison.<br />Ellie Cavanaugh was a little girl of seven when her fifteen-year-old sister, Andrea, was brutally murdered.  Andrea's death destroyed the Cavanaugh family.  Mr. and Mrs. Cavanaugh separated and Mrs. Cavanaugh became an alcoholic.  Ellie, who felt that she could have done more to save her sister, never overcame her feelings of guilt, grief and loss.<br />Ellie is now thirty years old and a successful investigative reporter.  She takes a leave of absence from her job in Atlanta because she is determined that Rob Westerfield, the man convicted of her sister's murder, not be released on parole.  She goes back to the town in New York where her sister died and painful old wounds are quickly reopened.<br />Many questions plague Ellie.  First, does Rob Westerfield deserve to go free after spending over two decades in prison?  Second, does startling new evidence that has come to light mean that Rob Westerfield may indeed be innocent of killing Andrea, and should he have a new trial to clear his name?  Should Ellie risk her reputation and maybe even her life by digging up the past and questioning everything that occurred during that fateful night when Andrea was killed?<br />\\"Daddy's Little Girl\\" is among Mary Higgins Clark's most accomplished novels.  After a prologue that is written in the third person, Clark wisely switches to the first person, and we experience the story through Ellie's eyes.  Clark effectively explores how crime can tear families and individuals apart.  She also demonstrates that the criminal justice system is fallible and often unfair to those who don't have the resources to fight for themselves.  \\"Daddy's Little Girl\\" is a moving and engrossing novel of suspense.\\"Daddy's Little Girl\\" is a moving and engrossing novel of suspense.	2002-05-05

Lovely Honora Willard is a naive twenty-year-old girl of limited means who works as a bank teller.  She is swept off her feet by smooth-talking typewriter salesman Sexton Beecher.  Soon Honora and Sexton are newlyweds who start their lives as a married couple in a ramshackle house near the beach.<br />Honora doesn't know it yet, but soon the stock market will crash, and her life with Sexton will never be the same.  Other people who are affected by the changes in the town are Vivian, a socialite whose personal unhappiness is matched by her great wealth, McDermott a handsome young mill worker who becomes a labor activist, and Alphonse, a fatherless boy whom McDermott has taken under his wing.<br />Shreve devotes a large portion of \\"Sea Glass\\" to the plight of the textile mill workers in Ely Falls, a fictional town meant to represent real New England towns beset by labor unrest in the 1920's and the 1930's.  She shows how the workers tried to form a union in order to fight for decent wages and to bring about better working conditions.<br />One of Shreve's strengths has always been her elegant prose.  Once again, in \\"Sea Glass,\\" Shreve captures the beauty of a walk on the beach in New England.  She waxes lyrical as Honora wanders back and forth near the ocean, collecting precious bits of colorful sea glass for her growing collection.  No matter what problems beset Honora, the beauty of the sea glass lifts her spirits and helps her imagination to take flight, as she wonders where the glass originated.<br />Another hallmark of Shreve's writing is her compassion for her characters.  She depicts Honora as a young woman who faces life's disappointments courageously and honestly.  In addition, through her fictional characters, Shreve describes the plight of the textile mill workers in great detail.  Shreve gives the reader a real understanding of what it was like to be victimized by heartless mill owners in the early part of the century.<br />Unfortunately, there are some elements that weaken \\"Sea Glass\\" and keep it from being a first-rate novel.  Shreve's book is occasionally preachy; it comes dangerously close to being a polemic on the importance of workers' rights.  Some of the characters, including Honora's self-centered husband, Sexton, border on caricature.  Honora Beecher is a little too saintly.  She rarely complains, in spite of having to bear a host of burdens, and this keeps her from becoming a fully realized character.<br />What makes \\"Sea Glass\\" worth reading is Shreve's beautiful use of descriptive language and and her deep feeling for her characters.

Matt is minding his partner's three children while she is away, and he finds the skeleton of a murdered baby while poking around in the attic of his new home.  It turns out that in 1969, there were some suspicious goings-on in the neighborhood.  To make matters more interesting, as a  seven-year-old boy, Matt had stayed in his Aunt Hettie's house for a time, and he played football (soccer) with the children in this very neighborhood.  He begins to remember bits and pieces about the friends with whom he played during that fateful year.<br />Barnard is using a plot device that has been used by many other mystery writers.  What happens when an old murder suddenly comes to light and long buried secrets are unearthed? Is the murderer still alive and will he or she ever be brought to trial for a thirty-year-old crime?  Who will care about a crime that occurred so long ago?<br />As it turns out, Matt cares very much.  In addition to his duties as a surrogate father and as a broadcaster, Matt makes it his business to investigate the murder.  He joins forces with Detective Sergeant Charlie Peace, who amazingly gives Matt carte blanche to behave like a latter-day Sherlock Holmes.  It turns out that Matt has an uncanny talent for investigative work and he and Sergeant Peace manage to locate many of the principles who lived near Elderholm.  Between them, they piece together the various elements that contributed to the death of that baby so many years ago.<br />Barnard's book is nicely written.  Matt is a likeable, intelligent and sympathetic character and the mystery is intriguing enough, although the solution is not particularly believable.  \\"The Bones in the Attic\\" is a reminder that the deep, dark secrets that we think are buried in our past sometimes come back to haunt us in later life.d sympathetic character and the mystery is intriguing enough, although the solution is not particularly believable.  \\"The Bones in the Attic\\" is a reminder that the deep, dark secrets that we think are buried in our past sometimes come back to haunt us in later life.	2002-04-28

I was expecting a workmanlike story that would hold my interest for an afternoon.  Instead, I found this novel to be so poorly put together and so garbled that all I got for my trouble was a splitting headache.<br />The heroine of &quot;Conflict of Interest&quot; is Joanne Kuhlman, an Assistant District Attorney in California.  Her vicious ex-husband, Doug, kidnapped and kept their children for two years, denying them any access to their mother.  In fact, he convinced the children that their mother no longer wanted them.  Doug was eventually caught and the children went back to their relieved mother.  Doug is now in jail awaiting trial for a host of crimes, including embezzlement.  Joanne's fifteen-year-old daughter, Leah, has developed into a hostile and angry teenager.  To add to her woes, Joanne's bank account was wiped out when she hired a private investigator to find her kids.<br />The case at the center of the novel revolves around two brothers named Gary and Tom Rubinsky, who spend their time drinking and smoking pot.

Worst of all, the plot veers off in a host of directions, including story lines about a former CIA agent on the run, Ian's saintly mother, and a budding romance for Joanne.

Patricia MacDonald's latest book, \\"Not Guilty,\\" is typical of a genre that I call \\"the woman in distress\\" novel.  This genre usually has a heroine who is beset by tragedy and who must hang together physically and emotionally so that she can fight for the survival of herself and/or her family.<br />In this case, the heroine is Keely Bennett Weaver, a woman who is widowed at a young age when her husband, Richard, commits suicide.  She subsequently marries a friend of Richard's, Mark Weaver, and her life finally seemes to be on track.  Keely has a son, Dylan, from her first marriage and a baby girl, Abby, from her second, and she enjoys both affluence and the love of her family.  What could possibly go wrong?<br />Since this is a \\"woman in distress\\" novel, everything goes wrong.  Keely suffers a horrendous shock which threatens to tear her family apart.  Her sullen and rebellious son, Dylan, is accused of murder, and Keely is determined to do whatever she can to protect Dylan from the authorities.  She also learns that several people whom she trusted over the years have been keeping some terrible secrets from her.<br />The first half of the book is suspenseful and engrossing.  Keely is an attractive and sympathetic heroine, down-to-earth and completely devoted to her children.  The book deteriorates, however, as the plot unravels towards the end. Too many characters in \\"Not Guilty\\" turn out to be wolves in sheep's clothing, and the melodramatic conclusion is forced and cliche-ridden.  In an attempt to give the plot several twists and turns in order to surprise the reader, MacDonald throws out both plot cohesion and realism.<br />I am still a fan of the \\"woman in distress\\" novel, but \\"Not Guilty\\" is only a partially successful example of this genre.  I recommend this novel for its strong beginning, with a warning that the ending does not hold up.	2002-04-19

Charlie and Oliver Caruso are close-knit siblings who work for a private bank named Greene & Greene.  Although they are generally honest young men, Charlie and Oliver are faced with a mountain of debt.  They care greatly for their loving mother who depends on them financially.  Suddenly, the brothers have an opportunity to make millions of dollars by committing a \\"victimless crime.\\" What would be the harm if they embezzled three million dollars from an old abandoned account?  The owner of the account is deceased and the money has never been claimed.  If Charlie and Oliver took the money, who would know?<br />As the two brothers soon find out, they have stumbled into a hornet's nest, and the stakes are much bigger than they could ever have imagined.  Soon, Charlie and Oliver are on the run, suspected of murder and in great danger from some bad guys who play for keeps.  The bad guys chase the brothers down to Florida, with the intention of permanently silencing them.<br />Does this plot sound familiar?  \\"The Millionaries\\" is one of the most clich&eacute;-ridden and amateurish thrillers that I have read in a long time.  Charlie and Oliver act like two overaged adolescents and their silly banter quickly wears thin.  They have the judgment of goldfish and their immature behavior makes it hard to believe that they are grown men.<br />The villains in this novel are complete stereotypes.  The plot is unrealistic, dull and uninvolving.  Not one of the characters has any life or dimension.  When I finally finished this 481 page book, I had a renewed appreciation for writers who craft thrillers that actually thrill.  This novel misses the mark completely. I recommend that you skip \\"The Millionaries.\\"	2002-04-16

Emma McLaughlin's and Nicola Kraus's new sensation, \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" is a hot item these days.  This book is an expose about the self-centered, mean-spirited and filthy-rich mothers who populate Park Avenue in Manhattan and the nannies that they hire. McLaughlin and Kraus, former nannies themselves, write a disclaimer at the beginning of the book, insisting that \\"any resemblance to actual events or persons, living or dead, is coincidental.\\"  Why don't I believe this disclaimer?<br />\\"The Nanny Diaries\\" follows a year in the life of a young NYU student named, appropriately enough, Nan, who takes a job caring for four-year-old Grayer.  He is the rambunctious son of a couple known to us only as Mr. and Mrs. X.  Nanny, as she is called by almost everyone in the novel, finds out quickly that she has signed on for a stint of indentured servitude.  Mrs. X insists that Nanny be the perfect caregiver, according to Mrs. X's exacting and quirky standards, and she also finds a myriad of other chores to keep Nanny running around in a mad frenzy.<br />As time goes on, Nanny becomes attached to Grayer, and she becomes equally disgusted with Mr. and Mrs. X.  They are cold to Grayer and their behavior is pretentious, shallow and self-centered.  While trying to maintain her self-respect in a degrading job, Nanny is also juggling her schoolwork and her social life.  Is the money that she is earning caring for Grayer worth the exhaustion and the humiliation that she must often endure?  Believe it or not, Mrs. X forces Nanny to attend a Halloween party dressed as a Teletubby!<br />McLauglin and Kraus effectively capture the moneyed lifestyle of the Park Avenue parents who care more about the brand names that their kids wear than about the kids themselves.  Although the characterizations are extreme and border on caricature, it is apparent that they are based on truth.  However, is \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" good fiction?  The novel is so one-dimensional and the authors are so anxious to hammer home their points that the novel doesn't completely work as fiction. The few scenes with humanity and warmth do not offset the endless name-dropping and whining which make up the bulk of the novel.<br />However, as an exercise in voyeurism, \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" works very well indeed.  We get a first-hand account of what really goes on in the living rooms and vacation homes of the overprivileged and the underprincipled.  Although there are many humorous passages in this book, it is ultimately a sad novel about people who have sold their souls and their humanity for the sake of wealth and of keeping up \\"appearances.\\"  One of the lessons that McLaughlin and Kraus forcefully drive home is that there are quite a few rich people are really lousy parents as well as miserable human beings.mer home their points that the novel doesn't completely work as fiction.

I recently read Daniel Silva's new novel, &#34;The English Assassin,&#34; and I was very impressed with its intricate and assured plotting, meaningful themes, and fascinating characters. Unfortunately, &#34;The Kill Artist,&#34; which was written first, does not measure up to the &#34;The English Assassin.&#34;  Both novels feature Gabriel Allon, a tormented man who has done undercover work as an agent for the Israeli government.  He now spends much of his time expertly restoring valuable works of art that have been damaged over the years.  Gabriel is something of a loner who would like to forget his tragic past.  He would prefer to stop working for the Israeli government completely and live a quiet and reclusive life in Cornwall, England.<br /><br />Gabriel's spymaster, Ari Shamron, has other ideas.  He convinces Gabriel to get back into the spy game in order to trap an old enemy.  Soon, Gabriel is on the trail of Tariq al-Hourani, a Palestinian zealot who recently assassinated the Israeli ambassador in Paris.  Tariq and Gabriel are old enemies and Gabriel cannot resist the chance to finally even an old score and rid Israel of an ardent and deadly enemy.<br />Naturally, there is a beautiful woman involved, as well.  Jacqueline Delacroix, born Sarah Halevy, lost her grandparents in the Holocaust.  She, too, has been recruited by Ari Shamron to help Gabriel trap Tariq.  She is in love with Gabriel, but he is reluctant to get romantically involved with her, for reasons of his own.<br /><br />The plot thickens, as Gabriel and Jacqueline go undercover and place themselves in grave danger while they track Tariq.  Their prey turns the tables on Gabriel and Jacqueline, and Tariq soon becomes the hunter. Gabriel fears that he will never capture Tariq.  Worse still, Tariq may be planning to carry out another assassination in order to destroy any hope of peace between Israel and her Arab neighbors. &#34;The Kill Artist&#34; doesn't work very well because Silva relies on cliches and stereotypes rather than spending time developing realistic characters.  The ending is melodramatic and forced.  &#34;The Kill Artist&#34; has a few exciting scenes here and there, but there are not enough of them to elevate &#34;The Kill Artist&#34; above the level of a pedestrian thriller.than spending time developing realistic characters.

Ruth Rendell's \\"Murder Being Once Done,\\" which was written in the seventies, is a flawed mystery with a few nice touches that redeem it slightly.<br /><br />Inspector Wexford has not been feeling well, and he has been farmed out to his nephew's house to rest, eat right, and exercise.  Wexford is supposed to avoid thinking about police work.  However, there are two problems.  One, Wexford is bored out of his mind.  Two, his nephew is a police superintendent investigating a juicy murder.  How can Wexford fail to get involved in the case?<br /><br />The victim is a young woman who was found murdered in Kenbourne Vale Cemetery.  Who is she and why was she killed?  This woman, it turns out, was living quietly in poverty under a false name.  No one knows where she came from.  Wexford starts informally investigating on his own, interviewing anyone who may know something about the identity of the dead woman.<br /><br />The investigation turns out to be a puzzle that challenges even Wexford's experienced and incisive mind, and he makes several wrong turns before reaching the correct conclusion.  He experiences a period of self-doubt and shame when he realizes that his powers of detection may be waning somewhat.  He even  considers the possibility that it may be time to step aside and let the younger generation take over.  Wexford is a wonderful character--intelligent, charming and compassionate.  It is always a pleasure to be in his company.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the mystery turns out to be less involving.  While looking into the case, Wexford meets a variety of people, all of whom contribute to his understanding of what happened to the dead woman.  Unfortunately, the characters are not fleshed out very well and the mystery itself turns out to be too convoluted and far-fetched to be completely satisfying.  On the plus side, Rendell's description of settings is detailed and vivid and she beautifully captures Wexford's torment as he tries to deal with his mortality and his imperfections.  \\"Murder Being Once Done\\" is not a great mystery, but it is a good study of a policeman who is desperately trying to prove that he still has what it takes to break a case.nce Done\\" is not a great mystery, but it is a good study of a policeman who is desperately trying to prove that he still has what it takes to break a case.	2002-04-07

Harlan Coben's \\"Tell No One\\" is like a giant jigsaw puzzle.  This book is so convoluted that when I reached the end, I had to double back and reread certain passages to clarify how all the pieces fit together.  For the most part, however, \\"Tell No One\\" is a satisfying, fast-paced and exciting thriller.<br />Dr. David Beck is a widower who is still grieving after having lost his wife, Elizabeth, eight years ago.  She was apparently abducted and murdered by a serial killer, who is now on death row.  Suddenly, some mysterious events occur which call into question everything that David thought was true about the past. He starts investigating on his own, hoping to unearth the truth about the events surrounding his wife's death.  Suddenly, David finds himself on the run from the police who suspect him of murder, and from some bad guys who have their own reasons for wanting him silenced.<br />Although this plot sounds trite and is reminiscent of many similar thrillers, Coben pulls it off.  One way that he does this is by creating some colorful characters such as David's lawyer, Hester Crimstein, a ruthless barracuda who takes no prisoners in defense of her clients, David's friend Shauna, a lesbian/model whose loyalty is exceeded only by her aggressiveness, and Eric Wu, one of the most menacing and deadly villains that you will ever come across.  The most entertaining character is Tyrese Barton, a street smart drug dealer whose friendship for Dr. Beck proves to be a life-saver.<br />The book's dialogue is fresh and witty and the action scenes are thrilling.  My biggest reservation about \\"Tell No One\\" is that some of the explanations at the conclusion of the novel were extremely far-fetched.  However, if you enjoy a lively thriller that will keep you on your toes from the first page to the last, you will probably be entertained by \\"Tell No One.\\"	2002-04-05

In \\"The Nazi Officer's Wife,\\" Edith Hahn describes how she grew up with her parents and sisters in Vienna in the 1920's.  Vienna in those days was a magical, picturesque and sophisticated place.  This lovely city was filled with sunny caf&eacute;s, cultural activities and daring intellectuals. Although the undercurrents of anti-Semitism were present in Vienna even then, Jews and gentiles coexisted side by side in peace.<br /><br />In 1938, Edith's world was turned upside down.  The German army marched into Austria; the Austrians voted for \\"Anschluss\\" or union with Germany.  After the Nazis took over, everything changed for Edith and her family.  German thugs ruled the streets and laws were passed which tightened the noose around Jewish necks day by day.  Some members of Edith's family escaped Austria before conditions deteriorated any further.  Edith remained in Austria and was sent to do forced labor at a farm and later at a work camp.<br /><br />How did Edith ultimately avoid deportation?  With the help of some friends, she obtained forged papers declaring her to be an Aryan of pure blood.  At the age of twenty-eight, she married a Nazi party member named Werner Vetter and spent the war years in Brandenburg, Germany, as a dutiful \\"Aryan\\" wife and mother.<br /><br />How could any woman live such a lie?  Although Edith at times hated herself for her deception, she felt that her actions were justifiable under the circumstances. Is Edith Hahn's story an honest and courageous tale of survival against all odds, or is it the memoir of a cowardly woman who sold out in order to save herself?  Each reader must answer this difficult question for himself.	2002-03-31

The time is the summer of 1935, and we meet the Tallis clan, a wealthy British family living in the countryside.  McEwan skillfully describes how certain key members of the household think and feel about their lives.  Thirteen-year-old Briony is lively, imaginative and spoiled.  She is desperate to be the center of attention.  Her older sister, Cecilia, a recent Cambridge graduate, is undecided about her future.  Their mother, Emily, whose husband neglects her, is often bedridden with severe migraines.<br /><br />Robbie Turner, the son of a servant, has graduated from Cambridge.  Robbie and Cecilia have always been friends, but their relationship is about to move to another level.  Subsequently, a series of unfortunate events occur that culminate in a thoughtless act that has devastating consequences.<br /><br />McEwan captures small moments that speak volumes about the characters.  For example, there is an angry scene between the cook and Emily, in which Emily orders the cook to change a menu that she had slaved over on a wretchedly hot day.  The anger and intensity that is generated in this scene says a great deal about the way some members of the British upper classes viewed their servants in 1935.  In another scene, Cecilia changes outfits again and again before an evening party, convinced that what she wears will fundamentally change her in some way.  McEwan is subtly showing us that the Tallis clan, in spite of their wealth and privilege, are fundamentally insecure and uncomfortable in their own skins.  They know on some level that their lives are shallow and meaningless, but they are powerless to change.<br /><br />The book moves forward through time, following the Tallises through World War II.  The scenes of battle are  bloody and graphic, unlike the first part of the novel, which was quiet and understated.  The author skillfully demonstrates how the upheaval of Second World War brought about an irrevocable transformation in both individuals and society.  Nothing could possibly remain the same after this monumental conflict.<br /><br />However, McEwan points out, certain realities remain immutable.  People cannot always gain atonement for the sins that they commit.  Individuals may make up excuses for their misdeeds, but they cannot undo the past.  \\"Atonement\\" is a novel of astonishing virtuosity, strong descriptive writing, and an ending that will shock you.

Chris Bohjalian proved in his wonderful novel, \\"Midwives,\\" that he has a deep understanding of the courage that ordinary people need to survive in a complex and often tragic world. He also showed an uncanny ability to write from both a male and a female perspective. In his latest novel, \\"The Buffalo Soldier,\\" Bohjalian once again beautifully explores how human relationships are tested by the pressures of life.<br />The setting is rural Vermont. Bohjalian focuses on a troubled couple, Laura and Terry Sheldon, whose nine-year-old twin daughters die tragically in a flash flood. The Sheldons are grief-stricken and their sorrow spills over into their marriage, threatening to tear it apart. Laura and Terry decide to take in a ten-year-old foster child named Alfred, who is African-American. Alfred is a gentle boy, but he is hesitant to bond with anyone, since he has been moved around regularly from one home to another over the years.<br />Bohjalian brilliantly describes the ever-changing dynamics in Laura's and Terry's relationship. The introduction of a child into their empty household may be an opportunity for the couple to heal, but Laura seems to relate to the boy while Terry holds back. Fortunately, Alfred is befriended by a wonderful and warm neighbor, Paul Hebert. Paul introduces Alfred to the history of the famed Buffalo soldiers, an African-American regiment that fought in the late 1800's. He also teaches Alfred how to care for and ride a horse. It is heart-warming to watch this reserved child blossom as he begins to form new friendships and as he learns more about himself and his heritage.<br />Bohjalian switches perspective from one chapter to the next, and he allows us to attain an intimate knowledge of what each character thinks and feels. By the end of the novel, I was deeply invested in the outcome. Occasionally, the dialogue is a bit stilted and there are a few scenes that border on the melodramatic. Overall, however, \\"The Buffalo Soldier\\" is a touching reminder that although human beings are fragile, they are also resilient. Loving someone deeply makes us vulnerable to loss, but if we are to achieve a meaningful life, it is a risk worth taking.minder that although human beings are fragile, they are also resilient.

Daniel Silva's \\"The English Assassin\\" grabbed my interest from the first page and took me on a exhilarating roller-coaster ride. It has non-stop action in a variety of exotic locales, fascinating characters, intelligent dialogue and terrific suspense. It is one of the best spy novels that I have read in years.<br /><br />Gabriel Allon is a talented art restorer who lovingly repairs old paintings. In his other life, he is a spy for the Israeli government.  He can kill expertly and without remorse when the situation calls for deadly force.<br /><br />Ari Shamron, Gabriel's handler, has a new mission for him. Gabriel is to visit Zurich and speak to an old Swiss banker named Augustus Rolfe, a man who wants to reveal his secret activities during World War II. Gabriel soon encounters some violent men who will do anything to prevent the truth about Switzerland's sordid past from becoming public knowledge. He also meets Rolfe's beautiful and tempestuous daughter Anna.  She is a troubled woman who, like Gabriel, is haunted by demons from the past.<br /><br />Who is the \\"English Assassin\\" in the title? He is a former British soldier who has become a ruthless killer for hire. He also becomes involved in the Rolfe case, but his agenda differs markedly from Gabriel's.  The English Assassin is a morally ambiguous character who is as fascinating as he is deadly.<br /><br />What makes this novel better than most of the other spy thrillers around? It does not rely on cliches to keep the intricate plot moving along. The characters are sharply written and the dialogue sparkles with wit, humor and occasional poignancy. What elevates \\"The English Assassin\\" most of all is the issues that it tackles. Silva explores the culpability of the Swiss bankers, who apparently were indispensable to the Nazi's war machine. Those who help murderers prosper from their horrible acts also have blood on their hands, Silva implies.

Naomi Ragen's four previous novels dealt with Orthodox Jews and their personal problems and struggles.  These novels were intensely human, very frank and controversial.  In a departure from these themes, Ragen's new novel, \\"Chains Around the Grass,\\" focuses on the unfortunate Markowitz family and their myriad personal problems.<br />The time is the 1950's and David Markowitz, husband of Ruth, and father of three children, is again forcing the family to move, for the fourth time in ten years.  He is a dreamer who thinks that one day he will strike it rich, and his family will then have the life that they deserve.  For the time being, however, the Markowitz family is moving into a low-income housing project in Far Rockaway, Queens, while David plies his trade as a taxicab driver.<br />\\"Chains Around the Grass\\" does not succeed, mostly because Ragen has no central focus beyond describing the family's miserable lives.  She touches on many themes, but they do not coalesce into a satisfying whole.  Ruth Markowitz stays at home with the children, as was traditional in the pre-feminist fifties, although she has few domestic skills.  Her considerable brains and talent are underutilized, which contributes to her depression and keeps the family income low.  David is a charming but unstable man.  He fights with his relatives who are better off than he, and he is simply unable to work at a steady job long enough to make good.  None of these themes has enough resonance to make the novel come alive.<br />The book does have its poignant moments, especially those that center around the middle-child, Sarah.  She is an excellent student, who believes that school and perhaps religion will be her ticket out of her dead-end existence. However, Ragen does not show us what is unique about this family and why their story is worth telling.  \\"Chains Around the Grass\\" is little more than a very bleak story about a very unhappy family.	2002-03-10

It is a slow-moving story about a law school professor named Ray Atlee who is summoned home one last time to see his dying father.  Old Judge Atlee is a revered figure in Clanton, Mississippi.  He has been respected as an outstanding and fair judge for nearly half a century.  He is also beloved as a charitable individual and as a man who truly loves his hometown.  However, the judge never had much time for his sons, Ray and Forrest.  He never forgave Ray for leaving Clanton to become a professor in Virginia, and Forrest has been an alcoholic and a drug addict for years.  When Ray comes home to meet with his father and his ne'er-do-well brother, he is in for several rude shocks.<br />Ray finds out that his father has been hiding a rather important secret and it weighs Ray down with a responsibility that he is unable to handle.  Throughout most of the book, Ray drives around (or flies) from place to place, seeking answers and conferring with his father's friends and acquaintances.  (Ray has had few meaningful relationships of his own since his divorce, and other than his job, his one passion is flying small planes.)  He is not cut out for a cloak and dagger existence. Occasionally, Ray receives threatening notes and he has the feeling that he is being followed.  Will his pursuers catch him before he finds out the answer to his father's secret?<br />The only thing that kept my interest was my desire to find out the true story behind the old judge's secret, and the solution turns out to be both unexciting and far-fetched.  The substance of \\"The Summons\\" is the exploration of the life of a lonely middle-aged man, his dysfunctional brother, and the colorful characters of Clanton, Mississippi.  The main theme is how greed can warp a person's judgment and distort his personality.  Unfortunately, the mystery at the heart of \\"The Summons\\" is simply not enough to carry the novel, and the characters and plot are too thin to sustain more than a passing interest.are too thin to sustain more than a passing interest.	2002-03-03

Abagnale described his misdeeds in his first book, \\"Catch Me If You Can.\\"  After years on the run, Abagnale was finally caught and he served prison time.  Finally, he decided to give up his criminal ways and he is now making more money than he ever did as a criminal. For twenty-five years, Abagnale has been a \\"fraud prevention specialist.\\" He helps businesses to recognize and prevent common types of fraud.<br />In his new book, \\"The Art of the Steal,\\"  Abagnale explains that fraud is big business and everyone is affected by it.  The billions lost by businesses as a result of fraud are partially recovered by raising consumer prices.  Fraud is more common today than ever before, with the growth of the Internet and other forms of modern technology.  Today, it is easier than ever to print checks that look like the real thing and to create false identity papers.  In addition to counterfeit money, counterfeit goods (including medicines and baby formulas) flood the market.  Ponzi and pyramid schemes and other investment scams are still going strong.<br />Why is \\"The Art of the Steal\\" an important book for consumers and businessmen?  Unfortunately, most people are complacent about security issues, and we don't take even the most obvious steps to protect ourselves from frauds and scams.  Abagnale encourages us to be more careful about giving away important personal information over the Internet or the telephone.  He warns us to shred personal papers before throwing them in the trash, and to be aware that if an offer appears too good to be true, that it probably is a scam.  He also explains how businesses can avoid becoming the victims of embezzlers.  Statistics show that embezzlers steal over $100 billion dollars a year from their employers.<br />The only negative I have about \\"The Art of the Steal\\" is that it is written in a dry and pedestrian manner, with a number of grammatical mistakes that the editor did not catch.  However, the quality of the writing aside, \\"The Art of the Steal\\" is a worthwhile book. Considering the necessity of protecting ourselves from the myriad types of fraud and scams that are out there today, it is important for all of us to be more knowledgeable and circumspect about security issues.he only negative I have about \\"The Art of the Steal\\" is that it is written in a dry and pedestrian manner, with a number of grammatical mistakes that the editor did not catch.

I loved John Katzenbach's novel, \\"Just Cause,\\" which I read a number of years ago.  It was a truly creepy psychological thriller that had me turning the pages eagerly to find out how the story would turn out.  Sadly, few of the elements that made \\"Just Cause\\" so riveting are present in Katzenbach's latest novel, \\"The Analyst.\\"<br />Dr. Frederick Starks, known as Ricky, is a stodgy New York psychoanalyst who leads a predictable and somewhat boring existence.  Since the death of his wife, his life centers around his routines, which include seeing patients, taking walks, and going to his summer home on Cape Cod during vacations.  Ricky never had children, he has few friends, and he never speaks to his relatives.  His life is uncluttered and to him, fairly satisfying.<br />Little does Ricky know that there is a mysterious stranger who hates him and who wants to punish him for a wrong that he committed years ago.  This stranger, along with his confederates, will settle for nothing less than the utter destruction of Dr. Frederick Starks.<br />In \\"The Analyst,\\" Katzenbach uses the time-honored device of the dynamics between the hunter and the hunted.  I cannot count how many thrillers have used the same device.  Will Ricky be able to find out the identity of his stalker before it's too late?  Who is this mysterious stranger and what has Ricky done to incur his wrath?<br />The answers to these and other questions are slow in coming.  For 424 pages, we are strung along, through dozens of twists and turns, as Ricky and his opponents thrust and parry.  \\"The Analyst\\" is in need of heavy editing.  The plot is overly convoluted and extremely short on logic.  Ricky's character is underdeveloped; he behaves more like a machine than like a man.  It is almost laughable how he completely alters his persona to meet the threat that faces him. In fairly short order, Ricky changes from a computer illiterate to an enthusiastic Internet surfer, and from a mild-mannered and sedentary psycholanalyst to a gun-toting survivalist.<br />I was curious how the plot would play out, but by the time I got to the ending of \\"The Analyst,\\" I was more exhausted than satisfied.  \\"The Analyst,\\" although occasionally gripping, is an unfocused and incoherent thriller.holanalyst to a gun-toting survivalist. <br />I was curious how the plot would play out, but by the time I got to the ending of \\"The Analyst,\\" I was more exhausted than satisfied.  \\"The Analyst,\\" although occasionally gripping, is an unfocused and incoherent thriller.	2002-02-10

It is her delightful novel, \\"Julie and Romeo,\\" and it is both hilarious and poignant.  Romeo Cacciamani and Julie Roseman are rival florists in Boston.  Their families have despised one another for years, although no one knows exactly how the feud started.<br />Years ago, Sandy, daughter of Julie, and Tony, son of Romeo, fell in love.  The feuding families forcibly separated the young lovers, who went their separate ways.  The feud seemed to be on hold until one day, the divorced Julie and the widowed Romeo, now both grandparents around sixty years of age, meet at a small business seminar.  Romeo and Julie are instantly attracted to one another, and their friendship blossoms (pun intended).<br />In one hilarious vignette after another, Julie and Romeo clandestinely try to carry on their affair without their families' interference. However, if you have read the Shakespearean play with a similar name, you know how hard that can be.<br />Jeanne Ray gives credence to the idea that people in their sixties can still experience desire for the opposite sex (what a radical notion!) and she shows how mindless prejudice can poison relationships.  Her scenes of family mayhem are priceless.  With Julie's overprotective daughters on one side and Romeo's thuggish sons and formidable mother on the other, can these star-crossed lovers ever find happiness? At a time when cleverly written light romances are few and far between, \\"Julie and Romeo\\" stands out as a small gem.	2002-02-03

Val McDermid sets \\"A Place of Execution\\" in Scardale, a fictional village in Derbyshire, England.  The year is 1963.  One day, thirteen-year-old Alison Carter comes home from school and takes her dog out for a walk. She is not seen again.  Several other children have been abducted in the area of late, and Alison's disappearance soon rings alarm bells.  The police are called in to investigate.<br />Detective Inspector George Bennett, who has never run a homicide investigation before, takes charge of the case.  Bennett finds, much to his consternation, that this case will take him away for many hours from his young and lovely wife whom he adores.  It will also plunge him into fits of doubt and despair that drive him to smoke endlessly and to stay up at night, worried and sleepless.<br />One problem is that the villagers of Scardale, who are all related to one another by blood, do not trust outsiders.  They refuse to open up to Bennett and they seem to be obstructing, rather than aiding, the investigation.  Another problem is that there is little physical evidence to guide the police. The investigation takes many twists and turns, some of which are quite startling.<br />The inside flap of this book calls \\"A Place of Execution\\" a Greek tragedy and that is an apt description.  It is a story of people destroying one another with no one really winning in the end.  The characters are beautifully drawn.  Detective Inspector Bennett is a model of rectitude and compassion.  Alison's mother, Ruth, is a grief-stricken wreck, and Alison's stepfather, Philip Hawkin, is devious and irritatingly nonchalant when his stepdaughter disappears.  McDermid captures the physical and emotional ambiance of a small English village perfectly and her sense of time and place is impeccable.<br />However, \\"A Place of Execution\\" falls short in several areas.  The pacing is too slow.  Many pages go by when little or nothing happens, and a little judicious editing would have helped.  The ending should have been exciting, but since it took so long in coming, the denouement is a bit anticlimactic.  Although the book seems to have as one of its themes the exploration of guilt and moral ambiguity, when the truth is finally revealed, there is little ambiguity.  \\"A Place of Execution\\" is an ambitious psychological thriller that only partially succeeds in delivering a strong emotional impact.have been exciting, but since it took so long in coming, the denouement is a bit anticlimactic.

John Lescroart's \\"The Oath,\\" is the latest in a series of books featuring the San Francisco criminal defense attorney Dismas Hardy.  Dis, as he is known to his friends, takes the case of Eric Kensing, a doctor who is suspected in the death of Tim Markham, the head of San Francisco's largest HMO, Parnassus.<br />Kensing had the motive, means and opportunity to kill Markham, who was having an affair with Kensing's wife, and who disagreed with Kensing on how an HMO should be run.  Hardy and his best friend, Abe Glitsky, chief of homicide, are soon at loggerheads over the case, and their friendship is strained to the breaking point.  The fallout from the Markham case is wide-ranging.  The HMO that Markham ran is bleeding cash and is teetering towards bankruptcy.  Have the administrators at Parnassus been involved in fiscal mismanagement?  If so, could Parnassus's financial woes have some bearing on Markham's death?<br />The case becomes more complex as the investigation proceeds, and Hardy, a happily married man with two kids, strains his family's patience as he spends more and more time investigating on his own.  Before the case is solved, Hardy risks his professional reputation and his personal relationships with his wife and with his best friend in his effort to get at the truth.<br />Lescroat does a fine job of balancing many disparate elements in \\"The Oath.\\"  He juggles a host of plot lines, including a series of unexplained deaths in Portola Hospital, where most of the medical action takes place, and the initiation of two rookie cops, who learn that police work is not an easy way to make a living.  \\"The Oath\\" has a very large cast of characters, and Lescroart develops them well.  We get to know a Salvadoran immigrant who watches her child die because of medical mismanagement as well as a greedy administrator who finds a way to make money at the expense of needy patients.<br />As always, Dismas Hardy is a engaging protagonist.  He is a model of integrity and a loving husband and father; yet he is willing to risk everything that he has to make sure that justice is served.  \\"The Oath\\" will appeal to a broad spectrum of readers, since it is a legal, medical and crime thriller all wrapped up in one exciting and entertaining novel.loving husband and father; yet he is willing to risk everything that he has to make sure that justice is served.  \\"The Oath\\" will appeal to a broad spectrum of readers, since it is a legal, medical and crime thriller all wrapped up in one exciting and entertaining novel.	2002-01-27

After marrying the love of her life, Peter, she moves to Los Angeles.  Unfortunately, Juliet rarely sees Peter anymore, since he is busy most of the time developing a television pilot.  Juliet is now a stay-at-home mom, who dearly loves her adorable three-year-old daughter, Ruby, and her four-month-old son, Isaac.  However, Juliet is suffering from acute sleep deprivation, leaking nipples and a lack of adult conversation.<br />So what's an overtired and understimulated mother to do?  Butt into other people's business, of course!  Juliet delves into the diappearance of an eighteen-year-old Chasidic girl named Fraydle Finkelstein, who baby sat for Juliet's kids on one occasion, and who then disappeared without a trace.<br />Juliet uses her investigative powers, her contacts from her working days as a lawyer, and her innate nosiness to solve the question of what happened to Fraydle. Did the girl run away to avoid an arranged marriage she didn't want?  Or did something more sinister happen to her?  Since her parents refuse to report Freydle's disappearance to the police, Juliet feels that it is her duty to investigate.<br />When Juliet visits her mother and father in New Jersey, she even takes a side trip to Borough Park, Brooklyn.  She interviews Freydle's prospective bridegroom, and little by little, she fits the pieces together until, voila, she solves the crime.<br />Waldman has a wry and clever sense of humor, and there are many laugh-out-loud passages in &quot;The Big Nap.&quot;  In fact, the first page has such a funny scene that I laughed out loud on a public bus and drew puzzled looks from my fellow passengers.  Waldman's takes on breastfeeding, sleep-and-husband deprivation, weight gain after pregnancy and a mother's love-hate relationship with her small children are not only funny but real.<br />The mystery is not too believable, nor is it realistic that any Chasid would give Juliet the time of day, much less reveal any inside information to her.  However, the conceit of mysteries like this is that people talk to the investigator, even if she has no business asking any questions in the first place.<br />However, Waldman nicely describes some of the dynamics of the Chasidic community from the vantage point of a non-Orthodox Jew. The mystery is engrossing, if somewhat far-fetched, and you could do worse than spend an afternoon with the amusing Juliet Applebaum, mommy and sleuth.o believable, nor is it realistic that any Chasid would give Juliet the time of day, much less reveal any inside information to her.

She is hoping that after Harry's memorial service, she will be able to forget the past and get on with her life.<br />Unfortunately, as further revelations come out about Harry and his death, Ellen's peace of mind is shattered and her family's security is threatened.

Now, she is a homebody and a regular churchgoer who is completely devoted to Cal and the kids.  Life is good.<br />Naturally, things do not stay that way.  Cal is suddenly faced with the troubling case of Peter Blue, a nineteen-year-old boy who has been arrested for assault, burglary, arson and threatening a police officer.  The only way to keep Peter out of jail, where he has already attempted suicide, is to bring him to Cal's clinic for an assessment and then psychiatric treatment.  Cal not only delves into Peter's psyche, but he explores his own as well, flashing back to memories of his relationship with his troubled parents and his self-destructive sister, Mina.<br />Cal's problems are just beginning.  On an outing in the woods, he thinks that he spots his wife talking to a stranger who seems to know her.  Marie denies that the incident took place.  Soon Cal and his family are threatened, and he fears that something or someone is out to destroy him.  Events soon spiral out of control and Cal faces psychological and moral dilemmas that threaten to tear both him and his family apart.<br />Klavan does a masterful job of building up suspense and he manages to keep the reader off guard.

Some of the books he has written are &quot;Deadly Harvest,&quot; &quot;Deadly Medicine&quot; and &quot;Deadly Care.&quot; Goldberg's latest is &quot;Fatal Care.&quot; Do you notice a certain sameness?  Unfortunately, this novel is too much like its predecessors, not just in title but in theme and execution.<br />&quot;Fatal Care&quot; features Joanna Blalock as a brilliant and beautiful forensic pathologist, with a touch of Sherlock Holmes and Nancy Drew in her.  Joanna is a top-notch scientist, a brilliant diagnostician and a tireless sleuth.  She loves to take foolish risks to get at the truth.  Her lover is Jake Sinclair, who is a both a hunk and a homicide detective.<br />This time around, the mystery revolves around a revolutionary treatment for clearing out blocked arteries.  Not only does the treatment clean out arteries, but it also miraculously turns back the clock and makes the arteries young again!  What could go wrong?  You guessed it.  There is a troubling side effect.  The treatment induces terminal cancer in those who receive it.<br />Joanna and her colleagues are called upon to look into this treatment in order to deduce why the patients were afflicted with cancer.  The investigation brings Joanna up against the nasty bunch of people in Bio-Med, a multi-million dollar genetics laboratory where there are some unusual and unauthorized experiments going on.  The people who run Bio-Med will do anything to keep their experiments a secret, including killing anyone who suspects them of doing illegal research. As corpses begin to pile up, Joanna risks her life to get at the truth lurking in Bio-Med's laboratories.<br />&quot;Fatal Care&quot; has many flaws.  It is filled with cliched situations and stock characters.  Naturally, Joanna puts herself in danger with predictable results.  The only redeeming feature of the novel is the science.

He has a vested interest in the investigation, since his former partner, Jean Bertrand, may have died in the crash while escorting a prisoner.  The investigators try to figure out what brought the plane down.  Was it sabotage, an assassination, an insurance scam, a mechanical failure or something else?<br />Complicating Tempe's life further is her discovery of a decomposed foot near the crash site.  When Tempe looks into her discovery, she suspects that it has nothing to do with the crash; she believes that it is a separate mystery that needs investigating.  Suddenly, Tempe is unfairly accused of tampering with evidence and of illegally removing remains from the crash site.  She is ordered off the investigation.  It appears that powerful people want to discredit Tempe professionally.  Later, when a mysterious man tries to run Tempe down with his car, she begins to realize that her life may be in danger, as well.<br />In &quot;Fatal Voyage,&quot; Reichs has created a large and colorful cast of characters, such as Ruby McCready, the bible toting owner of a bed and breakfast where Tempe stays, and Lucy Crowe, the local sheriff who is every bit as tough and tenacious as Tempe.  The dialogue sparkles and the narrative moves quickly, although you will need a scorecard to follow the many twists and turns in the plot.  The ending is a little weak--too melodramatic and unrealistic, considering the excellence of the writing up to that point.<br />Why does Tempe spend her life poring over the remains of dead people?  In this poignant passage, Tempe explains why she does such &quot;unpleasant&quot; work:<br />&quot;It is for these victims and the mourners that I tease posthumous tales from bones.

Shortly after the murder, the two perps who apparently committed the crime are found dead in a Brooklyn apartment, in what seems to be a murder/suicide.  The police officially close the case.<br />Matt and his droll, street-smart and computer-savvy sidekick, TJ, take on Kristin as an unofficial client, since Matt wants to dig into the case further.  He believes that there is more to these murders then meets the eye.  Unfortunately, as more corpses pile up, it becomes apparent that Matt is right--a psychotic killer with his own agenda is at work.<br />Matt uses his many contacts and his sharp mind to track down the killer, who is always one step ahead of him.  This time, it seems, Scudder has met his match, since the killer is fearless, clever, and elusive.  &quot;Hope to Die&quot; is by turns suspenseful, dryly humorous and chilling as Block skillfully unveils the truth about what really happened to the Hollanders.

She has just been diagnosed with breast cancer, the disease that killed her beloved sister.  Kathleen is frightened and lonely as she faces an uncertain future.  She also suffers pangs of guilt stemming from unresolved issues in her past.  Joyce Tabachnik is a forty-two year old writer who has just purchased a vacation home in Gloucester.  She has her own problems:  an adolescent daughter who has become increasingly irritable and rebellious, a husband who is so preoccupied by his work that she rarely sees him, and doubts about her professional future.<br />The women meet and an immediate bond is formed.  They share their fears and doubts as they take walks along the beautiful seashore known as Good Harbor.  As time passes, Kathleen and Joyce learn a great deal from one another.  They try to accept the past and look towards the future with increased confidence.<br />&quot;Good Harbor&quot; is easy to take.  Diamant vividly describes the beautiful scenery of Gloucester and I can see why this glorious locale might be very therapeutic for women in distress.  Joyce and Kathleen are pleasant company.  They are intelligent and funny, and Diamant sympathetically depicts Kathleen's and Joyce's doubts about themselves and the state of their marriages.  The passages about Kathleen's fears concerning her medical condition as well as her reaction to radiation therapy are particularly effective.  The book is fast-paced and the dialogue flows smoothly.<br />The novel would have been even stronger without some of the soap-opera elements that Diamant threw in.  I was particularly put off by the surreptitious and sordid affair that Joyce has with a stranger.  Joyce is too bright and emotionally together to risk her life and well-being by going to a remote location with a man whom she doesn't know.<br />In addition, Diamant (who has written a number of books with Jewish themes) inserts references to Judaism in this book that come across as artificial.  The &quot;Jewish theme&quot; doesn't fit in well with the rest of the narrative and the character of the woman rabbi is saccharine and a bit irritating.

Julie Parson's debut novel, &quot;Mary, Mary,&quot; was a chilling novel about a woman who is obsessed with avenging her daughter's death.  Parson's third novel, &quot;Eager to Please,&quot; is another fascinating psychological thriller with a &quot;revenge theme&quot;.<br />&quot;Eager to Please,&quot; set in Ireland, is the story of Rachel Beckett; she is a beautiful and highly educated woman who has spent the last twelve years in prison for killing her husband.  Rachel has paid a terrible price for this crime, which she claims she did not commit. She leaves prison at the age of forty-two, a ruined woman.  Rachel is most devastated by the fact that she can no longer have a relationship with her seventeen-year-old daughter Amy, who wants nothing to do with her.<br />The opening passages of this book are emotionally wrenching.  Parsons gives us a vivid sense of what life is like behind bars for a person totally unsuited to such a claustrophobic and highly regimented existence.  How will Rachel cope with life as a &quot;free woman&quot;?  Although her options are few, Rachel does have plans, and they are all about revenge.<br />Parsons has created a number of well-developed characters:  Jack Donnelly is a detective who is trying to get his bearings after separating from his wife; Andrew Bowen, Rachel's parole officer, is married to a woman he doesn't love who is slowly dying of multiple sclerosis; Judith Hill is a woman on the skids who befriends Rachel in prison and who ultimately becomes a victim herself.  All of these lives intersect as the characters attempt to cope with a series of emotional and spiritual crises.  Although Parsons gives ample weight to several intriguing suplots, she does not detract from the central story--how Rachel Beckett plans to take revenge on the person who ruined her life.<br />One interesting theme that Parsons explores is how women, such as Rachel and Judith, who are too &quot;eager to please&quot; the men in their lives are liable to end up in deep trouble.<br />I recommend &quot;Eager to Please&quot; for fans of complex psychological mysteries.  It is touching, suspenseful and extremely engrossing.end up in deep trouble. <br />I recommend &quot;Eager to Please&quot; for fans of complex psychological mysteries.

It has all the trappings that men love--tons of firepower  (with the weaponry described in loving detail) and large doses of intrigue and violence.  There is even a sexy seductress thrown in for good measure.<br />Web London is the &quot;Last Man Standing.&quot;  He is a veteran of the FBI's elite HRT (Hostage Rescue Team) who survives an ambush that leaves all of his colleagues dead.  Why did Web suddenly freeze and hold back when the rest of his team walked right into the ambush?  Is Web a traitor, a coward or both?  Both Web and his colleagues at the FBI would like an answer to that question.<br />Web has other problems, as well.  His face is permanently disfigured as a result of a gun battle years ago with a right wing group that, unfortunately, left a ten-year-old hostage dead.  Web has never gotten over the guilt from that tragic event.  Now that Web's buddies have almost all been wiped out, with him living under a cloud of suspicion, his life is barely worth living.<br />Web decides to fight back and the book, all 548 pages of it, is the story of how Web and a few good men get to the bottom of an insidious plot to destroy Web and his team.<br />The first scene of the book is very well done.  Baldacci describes the ambush in gripping detail and it is a dynamite opening.  He also populates his novel with some very colorful characters, including Big F, a huge drug dealer with a unique code of ethics, Perce Bates, an FBI man who is willing to give Web one last chance, and Gwen Canfield, a beautiful woman with an agenda of her own.  There is a quasi-love interest in the psychiatrist, Claire Daniels, whom Web consults to deal with his many psychological &quot;issues.&quot;<br />I was thoroughly engrossed in the various plot lines that deal with drug dealing, revenge, and conspiracies.  The book is fast-paced, but it is still a little too long, and the ending was more than a little far-fetched.  However, Baldacci's &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; is an exciting roller-coaster ride, and I sense that there may be a sequel down the road for Baldacci's fans to anticipate with pleasure.e book is fast-paced, but it is still a little too long, and the ending was more than a little far-fetched.

I have enjoyed Rochelle Krich's books very much, particularly &quot;Dead Air,&quot; which I described on Amazon as a &quot;timely and engrossing mystery.&quot;  Therefore, I opened Krich's new book, &quot;Shadows of Sin,&quot; with great anticipation.<br />&quot;Shadows of Sin&quot; deals with the brutal murder of Dr. Ronald Bushnell, a wealthy plastic surgeon, and two of his employees.  There is no shortage of suspects.  Bushnell had many enemies, including his foster son, Ethan, who has become rebellious and deeply troubled, a nurse whom Dr. Bushnell had recently fired and even a patient who was dissatisfied with her nose job!<br />Jessie Drake, a recurring character in Krich's mysteries, is one of the investigating homicide detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department, and she delves deeply into the dysfunctional relationships of the Bushnell family.  At the same time, Jessie continues to explore her Jewish heritage, taking tentative steps toward observing the Sabbath and a few Orthodox rituals.  She is also trying to develop a relationship with her religious instructor, Ezra, whom she has come to admire deeply.<br />Jessie knows about dysfunctional families, since for years, Jessie has held a bitter grudge against her abusive mother, Frances.  She is now trying to find a way to mend fences with both of her parents, who have a number of unresolved issues of their own.<br />Unfortunately, these intriguing plot lines are not well developed.  Jessie spends most of the novel interviewing one or another of the suspects, throwing suspicion first on one person, then on another.  The family relationships are alluded to, but they are not explored with any depth.  Krich flits from one theme to another, but she does not bring the characters to life.  Therefore, I was not emotionally invested in the outcome of the story.<br />The ending is extremely weak, with one too many surprises thrown in at the last minute.  More development of character and theme, and less concentration on elaborate twists and turns, would have made this a more readable and satisfying mystery.entration on elaborate twists and turns, would have made this a more readable and satisfying mystery.	2001-11-19

Lisa Gardner has stumbled badly with her latest novel, \\"The Next Accident\\". The book starts off promisingly, as Gardner reintroduces two characters whom I like, FBI profiler Pierce Quincy and former cop Lorraine (Rainie) Conner, both emotionally wounded people who need one another but who are either too proud or too frightened to admit how much they care.<br />Conner is now a budding private investigator busy setting up her own practice in Oregon and Quincy is suffering a series of personal crises.  His daughter, Amanda, has recently died after being on life support for over a year.  She had crashed her car after driving drunk in what seemed to be a tragic accident.  Quincy wants Rainie to look into the accident to see if it was really as straightforward as it seemed.<br />Quincy's life gets more complicated in a hurry.  A criminal with a grudge against him has robbed his identity and has given out his unlisted home number to criminals across the country.  When tragedy strikes Quincy's ex-wife, it becomes obvious that someone is out to destroy not just Quincy, but his entire family, as well.<br />Unfortunately, although Gardner sets up an intriguing plot, she does not have a satisfying solution to go with it.  The identity of the villain is meant to be shocking, but it is merely ludicrous, and the ending is an insult to the reader's intelligence.  The relationship between Rainie and Quincy is developed conventionally, and it is not enough to save the novel.  As I have written often in my reviews, it is not enough for a thriller to have an engrossing beginning; the ending must have an internal logic that makes sense to the reader.  \\"The Next Accident\\" has an ending that simply falls apart, and this does not make for an enjoyable reading experience.	2001-11-18

Val McDermid, in her new novel, &quot;Killing the Shadows,&quot; uses some well-worn plot devices.  A stalker targets writers of murder mysteries, killing them off using the same methodology as the writers use to &quot;bump off&quot; their own fictional victims.  In a parallel story, a suspect is apprehended for raping and killing a young mother of twins.  Politics and public opinion taint both investigations and greatly hamper the ability of the detectives to find the perpetrators.<br />If &quot;Killing the Shadows&quot; is so derivative, then why does it work so well?  The answer is that McDermid uses these formulas to their best possible advantage, creating memorable characters and putting them in intriguing situations.  She also makes the most of the settings, from the historic streets of Toledo, Spain, to the Scottish Highlands.<br />The main character is the fascinating Fiona Cameron, professor and academic psychologist.  Fiona is an expert at using advanced computer methods to help identify and track serial offenders and she has enjoyed a good measure of success in the past.  Fiona lives with Kit Martin, a writer of thrillers who may be on a killer's &quot;hit list&quot;.  Fiona's expertise is called upon in a series of cases, including one in Spain, but no case is more important to her than the one that involves the safety of her partner, Kit.<br />McDermid explores the theme of murder as fiction vs. murder as reality. The public loves grisly murder mysteries and the authors of these books often make a great deal of money.  Has our fascination with murder and mayhem hardened us to the horrible reality of violent death?  This is a thought-provoking theme.  Fiona's sister had been killed violently years before, and Fiona has been trying for a long time to &quot;kill the shadows&quot; that haunt her.  She understands from personal experience how the murder of a loved one shatters those who are left behind.<br />Unfortunately, &quot;Killing the Shadows&quot; falters at the end.  McDermid reaches quite a bit to come up with a surprise ending and it just doesn't wash.  The motivation and the behavior of the killer make no sense and the cat and mouse ending is more formulaic than fascinating.  However, &quot;Killing the Shadows&quot; is just fine until the end and I recommend it overall for its rich atmosphere and engaging characters.ters at the end.

Stella feels stultified by her dull and routinized existence.  Her marriage to Max has long ago withered and died and she is emotionally distant from her ten-year-old son, Charlie.<br />Stella's sexual &quot;awakening&quot; (with a nod to Kate Chopin) occurs when she embarks on a tempestuous affair with a mental patient, Edgar Stark, who had previously murdered and mutilated his wife in a paranoid and jealous rage.  This torrid affair endangers not only Stella's family life and her position in society, but her sanity, as well.<br />McGrath explores some of the same ground that Kate Chopin did in the aforementioned &quot;The Awakening&quot;.  What happens to a woman who feels like an ornament, and for whom taking care of household, husband and family isn't quite enough?  Like the heroine of &quot;The Awakening,&quot; Stella starts to inhabit a fantasy world and she becomes delusional in her thinking.  Her deterioration ultimately has disastrous consequences for herself and for her family.<br />Another theme of &quot;Asylum&quot; is the shortcomings of psychiatry.  The psychiatrists in this novel, including Max, Peter (his colleague and the narrator of the novel), and Jack, the superintendent of the asylum,  all come across as clueless bureaucrats who are incapable of curing anyone.  Furthermore, McGrath depicts all the men in this novel as insensitive clods who try to exploit Stella for their own gratification.<br />&quot;Asylum&quot; is not an easy book to read.  Stella's behavior is extremely off-putting, and it is hard to sympathize with her.  However, &quot;Asylum&quot; does hold the reader's interest, in spite of its shortcomings.  McGrath is extremely skilled at vividly describing Sheila's psyche, which is a frightening emotional roller coaster without any brakes.  &quot;Asylum&quot; is extremely depressing, but it does plumb the darker side of human nature very effectively.remely depressing, but it does plumb the darker side of human nature very effectively.	2001-11-05

Ed McBain's 87th Precinct novels are always entertaining.  He places quirky characters in dangerous situations.  Yet McBain leavens the intensity of the narrative with delightful and irreverent humor.<br />Cass Ridley is a tough woman.  She is a female pilot who served with the 101st Airborne in the Persian Gulf War.  She has decided to make some easy money by becoming a courier in a drug deal that takes place in Mexico.  Cass makes a tidy sum from the drug deal and she goes on a spending spree.<br />Another quirky character is Texas-born Wilbur Struthers, a peace-loving man who burglarizes apartments for a living.  He decides to burglarize Cass Ridley's apartment, and then things get complicated.  It seems that some of the money that Cass &quot;earned&quot; and that Will steals may be counterfeit.<br />A murder ensues, which involves the detectives of the 87th precinct as well as Fat Ollie Weeks, of the 88th Precinct.  It seems that the aforementioned drug deal is part of an elaborate scheme, involving enormous sums of money.  The action becomes complicated, and it is sometimes difficult to keep the characters straight without a scorecard.  A series of violent confrontations leads to more bloodshed.<br />The humor is provided by Fat Ollie Weeks, who eats almost without stopping, and who is sloppy as well as morbidly obese.  He is an unabashed racist and he hates all minority groups equally.  Weeks is completely oblivious of how obnoxious he comes across to almost everyone that he meets.  Ironically, as gross as he is as a human being, Weeks is a first-rate detective.<br />The book's timeliness stems from a plot dealing with Arab terrorists who intend to blow up a public building.<br />What keeps &quot;Money, Money, Money&quot; from realizing its potential is the convoluted plot that has one too many twists and turns.  Not only is there a counterfeiting plot, but there is also a plot about a drug addicted dealer named Wiggy who takes on a bunch of felons, much to his regret.  This, plus the terrorist plot, sinks the narrative under its own weight.<br />McBain juggles all these narrative balls competently enough, but the four or five plot lines do not add up to a coherent whole.  McBain's writing style is so fluid and effortless that he is always a pleasure to read. However, in the case of this novel, fewer complications would have added up to a more satisfying novel.s regret.

I have run out of superlatives to describe Peter Robinson, who is arguably one of the finest writers of British police procedurals, on par with P. D. James and Ruth Rendell at their best.  I have read ten out of the eleven Inspector Banks novels that Robinson has written over the years, and I have enjoyed most of them immensely. In Robinson's latest novel, \\"Aftermath,\\" Alan Banks is Acting Detective Superintendent in Yorkshire, substituting for his ailing boss.  Banks is depressed and on the verge of career burnout.  He smokes and drinks too much, gets too little sleep, and is overwhelmed by the demands of his job.  In addition, his love affair with Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot is not going well.  Banks is still grieving over his separation from Sandra, his wife of twenty years, and has little time or energy to invest in social relationships.<br /><br />Banks's life soon goes from bad to worse.  He is caught up in the case of the Chameleon killer, a man who abducts and murders teenaged girls.  The case appears to be solved when two detective constables respond to a call about a domestic disturbance.  The constables open the door, only to find a house of horrors, and they discover the identity of the man who appears to be the Chameleon killer. Those of us who know Peter Robinson quickly realize that the case is just beginning.  Who is Terence Payne, the biology teacher who apparently abducted, raped and murdered the young girls?  What role, if any, did Terence's wife, Lucy, play in her husband's heinous crimes?  Was Lucy a victim of spousal abuse herself, too frightened to tell the police what her husband was up to, or is she hiding something about her own shadowy past?<br /><br />As usual, Robinson creates a large cast of fascinating and believable characters, such as Maggie Forrest, a domestic abuse survivor who champions the cause of Lucy Payne, and Police Constable Janet Taylor, who stands accused of using excessive force while subduing Terence Payne. Robinson brilliantly explores the theme that police officers who invest themselves in their jobs pay a huge emotional and physical price.  He also studies the devastating effects that violence has on people's lives.  With keen psychological insight, an unerring ear for dialogue, clever plotting, and compassion for the human condition, Robinson has written a breathtaking novel of suspense.  I recommend \\"Aftermath\\" unreservedly.plores the theme that police officers who invest themselves in their jobs pay a huge emotional and physical price.

James Grippando's novel, &quot;Found Money,&quot; starts off with a bang.  Two people find that they possess a great deal of money. The question is, where did the money come from?<br />Dr. Ryan Duffy finds millions of dollars in his attic and Amy Parkens receives $200,000 in cash in the mail.  Duffy comes to realize that his father, Frank, who recently died of cancer, acquired the money by blackmailing a very wealthy person over a period of many years.  Should Ryan forget the past and just split the money among his family members or should he look into his father's dark secrets?  Should Ryan immediately contact the authorities or should he try to keep the matter in the family?<br />Amy Parkens also has a dilemma.  She is a single mother who is very short on cash.  The money would go a long way to solving her immediate financial crunch.  Amy's grandmother urges her to keep the money and to ask no questions.<br />Both Amy and Ryan, who had never met until this situation arose, decide to investigate this mystery.  Their search leads to heartbreak, scandal, upheaval and even death in their lives and in the lives of their families.<br />&quot;Found Money&quot; is very exciting and engrossing until the end.  When the mystery is at last solved, the solution is so convoluted and implausible that it weakens the fabric of the book considerably.  I recommend this novel for its interesting premise but I caution readers not to expect a satisfying ending.	2001-10-15

In &quot;The Deadhouse,&quot; Assistant DA Alexandra Cooper and Detective Mike Chapman once again team up to solve a homicide.  Lola Dakota (an unfortunate choice of name) is the victim.  Dakota was a distinguished professor of political science and an acknowledged expert on the history and politics of New York City.  Someone strangled Lola and pushed her down an elevator shaft in the apartment building where she lived.<br />Who had reason to want Lola dead?  Certainly her husband, Ivan Kralovic, is a suspect, since he had been abusing and stalking Lola for years.  Lola's colleagues at King's College are suspects, since she had clashed with some of them.  Alex and Mike interview many of Lola's friends and acquaintances in an effort to find a motive for murder.<br />Complicating the case is the fact that Lola was working on a historical project, an architectural dig on Roosevelt Island (formerly called Blackwells Island), in Manhattan.  It seems that many years ago, the island was used to keep New York's undesirables away from the rest of the city's population.  At one time or another, prisoners, people who were destitute and insane, or victims of contagious diseases such as smallpox, were confined to institutions on this island.  Lola and her colleagues are using the tools of urban archaeology to uncover some of the island's secrets.  Could this work somehow be connected to Lola's death?<br />I like the characters of Alex Cooper and Mike Chapman. Alex is beautiful, smart, sophisticated and dedicated to her job. Mike is irreverent, politically incorrect and a great detective.  Although Mike and Alex are seeing other people, it is obvious that they care for one another deeply, and their attraction to one another is a recurring theme in this series.<br />Another positive aspect of this book is the background information about Roosevelt Island that Fairstein provides.  Fairstein obviously researched the island's history thoroughly and I found this aspect of the novel fascinating.<br />Unfortunately, the mystery of Lola's murder is handled very badly.  The suspects are not compelling characters and the solution to the mystery is incoherent and implausible.  The ending of the novel falls flat and is extremely unsatisfying.  I am tired of killers who endlessly explain why they committed murder to their captives.

William Monk is a former policeman who is now a private investigator, and Hester Latterly, his wife, is a nurse. In \\"Funeral in Blue,\\" two women are murdered in the studio of artist Argo Allardyce.  One of them, Elissa Beck, was the wife of Kristian Beck, a respected physician with whom Hester has worked.  The other victim was an artist's model.  Both were strangled, although the police have no idea why they were killed or who did it.  Hester has a personal interest in this case, since her good friend, Callandra Daviot, secretly loves Dr. Beck and is anxious that he not be blamed for the homicides.<br /><br />In an implausible scenario, Monk joins forces with his old enemy, Runcorn, a policeman who is in charge of the homicide investigation. Monk and Runcorn interview everyone who has a connection to the case, and ultimately Dr. Beck is arrested, since his alibi for the night of the murders doesn't hold up.  In addition, it turns out that Dr. Beck had a strong motive for wishing his wife dead.<br /><br />As is usual in Perry's novels, most of the book consists of a series of repetitious interviews in which the investigators try to ferret out who is telling the truth and who is lying.  Nothing much happens until the end, when the murderer is finally unmasked.  Unfortunately, Perry does little to explore the relationship between Monk and Hester.  The couple spends very little time together and seem more like good friends than husband and wife.  The characters in \\"Funeral in Blue\\" are bland and the pacing is slow.  What Perry does well is describe the atmosphere of Victorian London.

The term \\"bad seed\\" has become a much used phrase to describe a person who is thoroughly evil from birth.  William March wrote \\"The Bad Seed\\" in the 1950's and it was later adapted for the stage and screen.  After reading this compelling story, I can well understand its popularity.<br /><br />Rhoda Penmark is an eight-year-old girl who is so self-contained, aloof and uncaring that her peers shun her.  Rhoda's gentle parents, Kenneth and Christine, know that Rhoda is not exactly like other little girls.  When she plays, she never gets dirty.  She has trouble expressing genuine affection.  On two occasions, a mysterious death has occurred (one involving an elderly lady and the other a pet dog), and Rhoda was the only witness.  It turns out that Rhoda had a motive for wanting both the old lady and the dog dead.  Is it possible that this innocent looking girl could be a murderess?<br /><br />Things come to a head when the Penmark family moves to Alabama to start fresh.  Kenneth is away on business while Christine tries to cope alone.  Rhoda is a student at the Fern grammar school.  She covets a gold medal that is given for penmanship at school, but the prize goes to a mamma's boy named Claude Daigle.  Rhoda is incredulous and she refuses to accept her defeat.  She hounds the boy to give her the medal that she feels is rightfully hers, until at an outing one day, Claude mysteriously drowns.  You guessed it.  Rhoda is the last person to have seen the boy alive.<br /><br />The book focuses not so much on Rhoda as it does on her mother, Christine.  March lets us observe through Christine's eyes her growing horror, as she realizes that her daughter may very well be a monster. When Christine finds the penmanship medal hidden among Rhoda's things, she is sure that Rhoda must have killed Claude Daigle to get the medal for herself.<br /><br />March masterfully builds Christine's psychological horror as the book progresses.  She learns that there is a secret in her own past that may explain her daughter's warped personality and she cannot bear the burden of guilt which this secret imposes on her.<br /><br />In the skilled way of good suspense writers, March does not just pile on the horror.  \\"The Bad Seed\\" has a great deal of humor, much of it centered on the character of Monica Breedlove.  She is an insufferable and interfering busybody who talks incessantly and who thinks that she is an expert on psychological analysis.  Another memorable character is Leroy, a caretaker who himself is evil and who is obsessed with Rhoda.  Leroy recognizes too late that he is no match for the little girl, and that teasing Rhoda can be dangerous to his health.<br /><br />A few passages, in which some characters discuss the age of violence and anxiety in which we live, are a bit heavy-handed.

This collection is so engrossing that I read all 367 pages in one day.<br />&quot;The Veteran&quot; is a powerful tale of murder and revenge.  It deals with an elderly man who is kicked to death by two thugs during a mugging in urban London.  The author describes the legal process during which the thugs are picked up and prosecuted.  Shockingly, one of the finest barristers in England decides to defend the muggers.  Why is the honorable James Vansittart QC, a brilliant and successful barrister, defending these disreputable criminals?  Forsyth brings the case to life with his superb description of London's criminal justice system. I could not put the book down until I read the dramatic and moving conclusion.<br />The other stories deal with such diverse themes as art scams, drug smuggling aboard an airplane, and a miracle in Siena, Italy.  These three stories feature vivid characterizations, crisp and realistic dialogue, subtle humor, intricate plotting, and nail-biting suspense.<br />The novella in the collection is called &quot;Whispering Wind,&quot; and it is the story of a scout named Ben Craig who survived Custer's Last Stand in 1876.  Forsyth brilliantly describes the battles between the white men and the Native Americans whom they victimized without mercy.  We get a picture of Custer as a clueless, arrogant, and reckless dandy who had no idea what he was up against at Little Bighorn until it was too late. Ben Craig is a sympathetic character.  He is a loner who is completely at home in the frontier and he is a young man of compassion and sensitivity.  Craig falls in love with and rescues a young Cheyenne girl who is about to be raped and killed by Custer's soldiers.  The relationship between Craig and the Cheyenne girl takes a supernatural turn which gives the story an added dimension.<br />It is wonderful to see that the art of storytelling is alive and well in this marvelous collection.ee that the art of storytelling is alive and well in this marvelous collection.	2001-10-09

In dozens of medical thrillers, the administrators of HMO's and the physicians belonging to them either withhold vital care, engage in ghoulish experimentation, or actively kill their patients in order to reap greater profits.<br />In Peter Clement's &quot;The Procedure,&quot; the hero is Earl Garnet, Chief of the Emergency Room in St. Paul's Hospital, located in Buffalo, N. Y.  Garnet is enraged at an HMO called Brama, which has engaged in a deliberate campaign to discourage patients from going to the hospital.  The officials at Brama let their patients know that if their ailments turn out to be minor, then the patients themselves will be solely responsible for their hospital bills.  Unfortunately, a number of patients die because they delay going to the hospital until their conditions became too serious to ignore. Garnet angrily calls Brama's tactics &quot;no-fault murder&quot;.<br />The HMO decides to boycott St. Paul's in order to punish Garnet, and his fellow physicians are annoyed with him.  However, all this takes a back seat to a series of brutal murders that occur on the grounds of St. Paul's.  Someone is slashing physicians' throats and the police do not have a clue who the murderer is or what his motive may be.<br />Gradually, Garnet and Riley, a policeman assigned to the case, realize that the murders are somehow tied to the Brama HMO and to a shadowy facility that Brama runs in Mexico to treat hard-core alcoholics.  Garnet risks his life to uncover the truth about Brama and to bring the HMO to its knees.<br />Clement is very good at describing medical procedures.  The scenes that take place in the operating room and in the emergency room are authentic and exciting.  His indictment of HMO's, while not a new theme in medical thrillers, does hit home.<br />However, the characters are the same old tired stereotypes.  Garnet is the intrepid hero who is unafraid to go into the lion's den to uncover the truth.  He has an equally heroic friend named Jack who also is willing to give up his life to defeat the HMO's.  The bad guys practically twirl their mustaches as they perform their villainous deeds.  The identity of the killer is obvious long before the end of the book, yet the author springs it upon us at the end as if it is a big surprise.<br />I give &quot;The Procedure&quot; high marks for the author's medical know-how, but low marks for the contrived plot and the stereotyped characters.the truth.

Alan Dershowitz, the famous attorney and law professor, attempts in his novel, &quot;Just Revenge,&quot; to explore the moral and legal ramifications of revenge.  Is it legal or ethical for a Holocaust survivor to punish an elderly man for the actions that he committed as a Nazi collaborator during World War Two?<br />Professor Max Menuchen is the sole survivor of a Lithuanian family that was brutally wiped out by a Nazi collaborator named Marcellus Prandus in 1942.  Prandus is now an elderly man who will soon be dead of cancer.  However, it is likely that he will die a contented man, since he is surrounded by his beloved children and grandchildren who admire and respect him.  Max wants Prandus to experience the despair that he felt when he watched Prandus brutally exterminate his family so many years ago.<br />Therefore, Max, with the help of a friend, concocts an elaborate scheme that results in Prandus's death.  When he is arrested and goes to trial, Max is defended by attorney Abe Ringel, who argues that Max acted out of personal anguish and that his behavior was simply a desire for &quot;just revenge&quot;.<br />Although Dershowitz's intentions are good in writing this philosophical and psychological novel, he has not created a satisfying work of fiction.  The characters are not believable and the story is little more than an excuse for a philosophical discussion about what is or is not excusable in the name of revenge.  Also problematical is the ending, in which a surprise witness miraculously shows up in order to influence the outcome of the trial.<br />I agree that the themes of revenge and forgiveness are worth exploring (as Simon Wiesenthal did in his brilliant book, &quot;The Sunflower&quot;).  However,  Alan Dershowitz's novel is too artificial to be an effective vehicle for analyzing this important subject.	2001-10-04

The villains in &quot;Edge of Danger&quot; are the Rashids, a ridiculously wealthy family that is half-Arab and half-English.  The leader of the clan is Paul Rashid, who is a graduate of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and is also a decorated veteran of the Gulf War.  Paul's two brothers, Michael and George, are also graduates of Sandhurst, and their beautiful sister, Kate, attended Oxford University.<br />Paul Rashid is enraged when his mother is killed by a Russian commercial attache driving on the wrong side of the road.  It turns out that the Russian, whose name is Gatov, enjoys diplomatic immunity; he is brokering an oil deal in the Middle East for the Russians and the Americans.  The interests of Gatov and his friends conflict with the oil interests of the Rashid family.  Paul Rashid decides that it is in his best interests to strike at his enemies before they can strike at him.  He forms a plot to assassinate the President of the United States.<br />&quot;Edge of Danger&quot; is basically a cat and mouse game between Paul and his family on one side, and Sean Dillon, the former IRA soldier and scourge of the British military, on the other side.  Sean occasionally does dirty work for his former enemy, Brigadier General Charles Ferguson. When Ferguson needs a tough job done on behalf of the British government, he calls in Dillon, who is an expert marksman, knows how to fly any plane that exists, and can even scuba dive.<br />Dillon and his cohorts fight it out with Rashid and his hired thugs, and a great deal of blood is spilled.  In this violent book, people die in many ways, such as knifing, gunshot wounds, having their necks broken, drowning, and falling off balconies.  Rashid is little more than a rich sociopath, and his character makes little sense.  Why would a man who enjoys enormous wealth and an enviable social position behave like a common thug?  His excuse that he wants &quot;vengeance&quot; doesn't explain his completely irrational behavior.<br />Although the action scenes are exciting enough, carnage alone is not enough to make a book credible and interesting.  None of the characters rises above the level of a stereotype.  &quot;Edge of Danger&quot; is basically a string of bloody action scenes glued together with some exposition and stilted dialogue.

Iris Johansen's &quot;Final Target&quot; is an action-adventure novel which combines intrigue and murder with passionate romance. Cassie Andreas is the seven-year-old daughter of the President of the United States. She has been traumatized by a violent encounter and she now stays in her bed, mute and unresponsive.<br />Dr. Jessica Riley has been hired to help bring Cassie back. Jessica's sister, Melissa, was brought back from a catatonic state by her sister years ago. Melissa feels a connection to Cassie, and she also tries to help the little girl.<br />The plot thickens as Michael Travis, hunky adventurer, smuggler, and thief, enters their lives. He had saved Cassie's life during the aforementioned traumatic episode and he, too, gets involved in helping to revive the girl.<br />To further complicate matters, Michael is involved in several illegal and dangerous schemes. His arch-enemy, Edward Deschamps, is out to kill him and to obtain a beautiful statue, &quot;Wind Dancer,&quot; that is prized by the Andreas family. In addition, it turns out that several of the characters in the book have psychic powers that enable them to sense impending danger and even to communicate with one another telepathically.<br />Johansen does not bother too much with such niceties as character development and descriptive prose. The novel consists mostly of dialogue accompanied by a far-fetched plot. Although &quot;Final Target&quot; is little more than a fairy tale, it is fast-moving, and it may please lovers of escapist fare.	2001-09-23

Besides being a devastatingly handsome man, Ethan is also a volunteer fireman who has risked his life to save others, a carpenter who does superior work and keeps his word to his customers, and a beloved coach of the Little League team. He is a loving husband to his beautiful wife, Jorie, and a devoted father to his son, Collie. Ethan is almost too good to be true.<br />In her new novel, &quot;Blue Diary,&quot; Alice Hoffman takes the mask off Ethan Ford, who, as it turns out, really is too good to be true. Ethan has been hiding a terrible secret about his past, and when the secret is revealed, it changes not only his life, but the lives of his family and his friends.<br />In this novel, Hoffman explores how people confront tragic, life-changing events. In the face of heartache, the characters in the book react in a variety of ways. Collie, Ethan's son, retreats from life and becomes bitter. Jorie forces herself to confront who her husband really is and what he has done. Jorie's friends, Charlotte and Barney, stand by her and offer what consolation they can at this horrible time.<br />Not only does Hoffman deal with the fallout from Ethan's situation, but she also explores how the other characters face crises in their lives. Charlotte has breast cancer and has months of painful treatment ahead of her. Kat and Rosarie Williams are two sisters, neighbors of the Fords, who have never fully come to terms with their father's suicide a year ago. Facing a terminal illness, Mr. Williams ended his own life; was his suicide an act of selfishness or an act of love? Or was it the act of a desperate man who was suffering unbearable pain and wanted it to end?<br />Hoffman changes point of view in the novel, sometimes switching to first person, with Kat as the narrator. Although this is a bit jarring, Kat is a ruthlessly honest observer. Kat is concerned about her best friend, Collie Ford, and also about her troubled and beautiful sister, Rosarie, who is impulsive, promiscuous and emotionally stunted.<br />Hoffman, in often lyrical prose, is perhaps too ambitious in her desire to depict how the members of this town interact with one another and face their personal demons.  Is &quot;Blue Diary&quot; too busy and too filled with angst and tragedy? Perhaps. Is the ending too abrupt, with too little resolution? Possibly. Hoffman definitely leaves the character of Ethan unexplained. We never find out who he truly is underneath his perfect veneer.<br />However, Hoffman makes the reader care deeply about the members of Monroe and she brings her characters to life in a way that few other novelists can. &quot;Blue Diary&quot; is a powerful and touching novel.tiful sister, Rosarie, who is impulsive, promiscuous and emotionally stunted.<br />Hoffman, in often lyrical prose, is perhaps too ambitious in her desire to depict how the members of this town interact with one another and face their personal demons.

Two decades ago, I read Susan Isaacs's wonderful &quot;Compromising Positions&quot;. I fell in love with the saucy and witty Judith Singer, amateur sleuth and canny critic of the Long Island social scene.<br />Judith is back. Two years widowed, she has a doctorate in history and she teaches at St. Elizabeth's College. Her kids are grown and gone. She has a little time on her hands. So what would be a good use of her spare time? Isn't it obvious? She should investigate another Long Island murder, of course!<br />It seems that a young wife and mother named Courtney Logan has mysteriously disappeared and Judith, who had no personal contact with the victim, has appointed herself unofficial sleuth to find out what really happened to Courtney. Judith has the help of &quot;Fancy Phil Lowenstein,&quot; erstwhile mobster and father-in-law of Courtney.<br />To complicate matters, Judith still holds a torch for Nelson Sharpe, the hunky cop whom she had fallen in love with so many years ago. He reappears in her life and, lo and behold, the spark is still there.<br />&quot;Long Time No See&quot; is a delightful souffle. Isaacs knows the Long Island social scene. Her hilarious observations on interior decorating, fashion, child-rearing and infidelity, Long-Island style, are sharply satirical. She makes the most of her motley group of characters, from Courtney's female associates, to Fancy Phil (who is constantly weighed down with tasteless gold jewelry), to Courtney herself, a beautiful cipher with a mysterious hidden life.<br />It is great fun to be in Judith's company. She is self-effacing, insatiably curious, nosy and always lively. Isaacs inserts some poignant observations about the loneliness of widowhood. It seems that Judith misses her late husband, even though her marriage had long since become stale. I enjoyed the interplay between Judith and the love of her life, Nelson. Will they be able to pick up where they left off?<br />A weakness in the novel is Isaac's handling of the mystery of Courtney's disappearance. Judith wears herself out questioning dozens of people at length and it gets a little tedious after a while. Why would these people be so forthcoming to a total stranger without any credentials?<br />In addition, the ending of the novel is formulaic and way over the top. The solution to the mystery makes little sense. However, in spite of these flaws, this book will be a huge success and I recommend it.

Robin Cook's new medical thriller, &quot;Shock,&quot; is shocking in only one respect. How can an author with Cook's reputation write a book so hackneyed, wooden and lacking in suspense as this one?<br />The protagonists are Joanna Meissner and Deborah Cochrane, two beautiful and brainy doctoral students. Yet, for all of their intellectual prowess, these two women see nothing fishy in an advertisement in the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; for egg donors. The ad offers forty-five thousand dollars to every egg donor that the clinic accepts.<br />Naively, the two women go to the Wingate Infertility Clinic, and they donate their eggs. They women take a glorious trip to Italy with their newfound wealth. Over a year later, they decide to look into the fate of their donated eggs by finding employment in the Wingate Clinic and doing some snooping. Joanna and Deborah predictably find out that the Wingate Clinic is engaged in some very questionable and unethical research. Will the ladies be able to get the authorities to help them before they are captured and killed by the nasties who run the clinic?<br />Joanna and Deborah are two of the most ridiculous sleuths that I have ever seen. They are like two overaged Nancy Drews, coming up with one presposterous plan after another. Their dialogue is stilted and silly and their behaviour is immature and inane. Deborah dresses like a hooker to avoid being recognized at the clinic and her ridiculous getup becomes a silly recurring joke.  The book peters off at the end and Cook offers no real resolution to the asinine plot.<br />The premise of the book, namely that fertility clinics are the ideal setting for reproductive chicanery, has been done before many times. Cook breaks no new ground here. &quot;Shock&quot; is witless, dull and without any literary merit whatsover.	2001-09-16

Siegel's protagonists are criminal defense attorney Michael Daley, and his ex-wife and law partner, Rosie Fernandez. Daley, a former priest, retains the compassionate and caring nature that led him into the priesthood in the first place. Although Rosie and Michael are divorced, they often spend the night together. It seems that they get along better with one another now that they are no longer married.<br />Rosie and Michael are hired to defend Skipper Gates, the San Francisco DA. Skipper is an unlikable political type who is accused of murdering a male prostitute with whom he spent the night. Not only will this scandal potentially ruin Skipper's career, but he could conceivable be sent to Death Row if a jury finds him guilty and special circumstances are invoked.<br />With the help of a large cast of characters, including Rosie's brother, Michael's brother, a priest and an eightysomething private investigator, Michael and Rosie take a hard look at everyone who was involved in the events surrounding the murder. They uncover a morass of decadence, corruption and illicit business activity involving some very important people; although not all of the wrongdoers are punished, no one emerges from the tragedy completely unscathed.<br />Siegel does a nice job of blending humor and human interest into the mystery. Rosie and Michael are competent lawyers, but they are not superhuman crimefighters, as so many attorneys are portrayed in the more hackneyed legal thrillers. The mystery is engrossing, the characters are lively, and I really became fond of Rosie and Michael. They are an attractive and entertaining couple and I recommend &quot;Incriminating Evidence&quot; to fans of legal thrillers.	2001-09-10

Barbara Parker has written a book that not only succeeds as a legal thriller, but it works on a number of other levels as well.<br />Those who have read this series know about the tempestuous relationship of Gail and Anthony. Anthony Quintana, a successful criminal lawyer, is handsome, proud, rich and a bit condescending at times. Anthony, a Cuban, was born into a society in which men are dominant, and he sometimes forgets that Gail Connor, also a lawyer, takes orders from no one. Gail will not accept Anthony unless he treats her as an equal.<br />In this novel, Gail takes the case of Kenny Ray Clark, the grandson of a woman named Ruby, who cared for Gail and her family for many years. Kenny has been condemned to die for a twelve-year-old crime that he claims he did not commit--the murder of a young woman, Amber Dodson. Anthony tells Gail that she is making a mistake in taking this hopeless case. Gail is not a criminal attorney and she has no idea how much time and money it will take to carry out an appeal to a death sentence. Anthony is proven right, but instead of fighting with one another, as they would have done in the past, Gail and Anthony join forces to help free Kenny.<br />Parker does many things well in this novel. In flashback, she describes in vivid detail the murder of Amber Dodson, as well as the events that led up to the arrest of Kenny Ray Clark. We learn about Amber's ineffectual husband, Gary, and her boss, Whit McGrath, a wealthy developer with a shady past. Could one of these two men have been involved in Amber's death?<br />The mechanics of conducting a &quot;death appeal&quot; are meticulously laid out and explained, and Gail's exhaustive efforts to free Kenny leave her physically and emotionally drained. She and Anthony learn that the story of Amber Dodson's death is much more complicated that it first appeared. Amber Dodson was involved in an affair with her boss, Whit McGrath, a man with a great deal of money and some secrets that he would not want revealed. Was Amber killed to keep her silent? Or did her killer have another reason for viciously stabbing her to death?<br />In &quot;Suspicion of Vengeance,&quot; Barbara Parker, a former prosecutor herself, shows that the criminal justice system is deeply flawed. When the police and the courts make mistakes, they rarely admit it. Instead of depicting the character of Kenny Ray Clark as just another loser, the author climbs into Kenny's skin to show how it feels to be wrongfully condemned to death.<br />There are several mysteries in the novel and Parker handles them all with skill. The novel ends in a stunning and climactic manner and the loose ends are not all tied up neatly, just as life is not always neat and tidy. Gail's and Anthony's relationship has evolved from a strong physical attraction based on passion into a partnership based on caring and compassion. I recommend &quot;Suspicion of Vengeance&quot; highly.

Dr. Catharine Cordell is a beautiful and brilliant emergency room doctor who narrowly escaped death after having been brutally [attacked] in Savannah, Georgia.  She shot and killed her attacker and hoped that she had closed the chapter on that horrible incident.<br />Unfortunately, there is another killer loose in Boston, where Tess Gerritsen's new thriller, \\"The Surgeon\\" takes place.  \\"The Surgeon\\" is the name given to a vicious man who stalks young women and then sadistically tortures, mutilates and murders them with a scalpel.<br />In some ways, this is a conventional slasher novel.  The killer, a faceless presence throughout the book, is brilliantly evil and meticulous in his methodology; he also takes gory trophies to remind him of his victims. Does this sound familiar?  It should, since this is the plot of dozens of novels that are written every year.  Although I enjoy thrillers, I wonder why so many readers take such pleasure in books that depict women as victims.  This theme has been done to death (excuse the pun) and I am surprised that Gerritsen resorted to such an overused plot device.<br />In spite of my qualms about the theme, \\"The Surgeon\\" held my interest.  Dr. Cordell is a strong and feisty woman who has closed herself off from her emotions because of her traumatic past.  She is an interesting counterpoint to Thomas Moore (one of the detectives looking for the serial killer) with whom she falls in love.  Also interesting is Detective Rizzoli, a young female cop, who resents having to prove herself to her male counterparts.  Rizzoli is a bitter and competitive person and she reminds me of many women who find it difficult to make it in a man's world.<br />\\"The Surgeon\\" is fast-paced, with plenty of dialogue and action to keep the plot moving.

It is a tribute to Gerritsen's skill that she can take a plot that has been done so many times before and still make it riveting.ute to Gerritsen's skill that she can take a plot that has been done so many times before and still make it riveting.	2001-09-02

I used to be a fan of Faye Kellerman, but I stopped reading her books a while back. I picked up her new novel, &quot;The Forgotten,&quot; to see if she has regained her touch. She hasn't. This latest installment in the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series starts with a horrible act of vandalism. A synagogue is trashed and defiled. Swastikas are painted on the walls and photos of concentration camp victims are left atop torn holy books. Peter Decker, who is a Lieutenant with the LAPD, goes into action and eventually finds the perpetrator of this vandalism. He is seventeen-year-old Ernesto Golding, a rich kid with a very sick mind. The case is closed out, but a series of brutal murders prove that there is more to this story than meets the eye. Golding may have had a grandfather who was a Nazi passing himself off as a Jew. In addition, Golding had ties to a hate group with a shadowy leader. The members of this group, called &quot;Preservers of Ethnic Integrity,&quot; may have been involved not only in the vandalism, but in other crimes as well. The biggest problem with &quot;The Forgotten&quot; is that it flits from one plot line to another without any transition. Kellerman actually mixes up a plot about people who hate Jews with a plot about psychologists who help rich kids cheat on their SAT's. Also thrown into the mix is a story line about Peter Decker's stepson, Jacob, who has been mixed up with some of the baddies in the past, and who is now trying to straighten himself out. Peter struggles to come to terms with his responsibilities and his guilt, since he has neglected the boy in the past. The novel has little in the way of character development. The characters are distasteful, dysfunctional and dull. The ending is anticlimactic and very slow in coming. I do not recommend this muddled mystery.	2001-08-26

Butch is now the Chief Assistant District Attorney for Manhattan. Marlene is working for a private security firm that is about to trade its stock publicly and she is happily contemplating the prospect of becoming enormously wealthy.<br /><br />Butch, meanwhile, is knee-deep in an investigation of corruption in the police department that is also tainting the District Attorney's office.  Butch's boss, Jack Keegan, is facing a tough election, and Keegan would prefer that Butch turn a blind eye to certain questionable cases that are passing through the system.  However, being the white knight that he is, Butch feels compelled to investigate a police shooting that is not what it seems, as well as the murder of an unarmed homeless man by a woman who claims that she acted in self-defense.<br /><br />Tanenbaum presents a large and colorful cast of characters, from a group of wretched and pathetic homeless men and women to Marlene Ciampi herself.  Marlene goes beserk after she is involved in a shooting and, at the same time, she discovers that she has millions of dollars to spend.  She becomes an alcoholic and a shopaholic and her behavior is both outrageous and terrifying.  Butch and Marlene's daughter, Lucy, is now seventeen and she is as rebellious and unhappy as ever.  She cuts school regularly to visit, feed and nurture the homeless and she is also suffering the pangs of her love for an \\"older man\\".<br />Tanenbaum wisely brings back characters from his previous novels for cameo appearances.  Roland Hrcany, Guma, and V. T. Newbury (each a former or present colleague of Butch) add spice to the novel as they help to move the plot along.  Tran, the former Vietcong who has helped the family in the past, coaxes Lucy out of her scholastic doldrums, and Father Dugan aids Butch in his investigation and participates in the final climactic chase scene. The dialogue is witty, fast-paced and politically incorrect.  \\"Enemy Within\\" is filled with insights about what really passes for justice in the political town known as New York City.<br /><br />This novel does have several weaknesses.  As usual, Tanenbaum likes coincidences and it just so happens that Lucy's homeless friends are involved in the very case that her father is investigating.  In addition, Marlene's recovery from her addictions is abrupt and unrealistic.  One does not \\"snap out\\" of alcoholism, which is a serious illness, not a phase.  Finally, the ending is a little too pat, as Tanenbaum struggles to tie up the many loose ends which dangle at the end of the novel.<br />In spite of these quibbles, \\"Enemy Within\\" is an entertaining and engrossing legal thriller that will undoubtedly please the many fans of this long-running and successful series.and politically incorrect.  \\"Enemy Within\\" is filled with insights about what really passes for justice in the political town known as New York City.<br /><br />This novel does have several weaknesses.

Holly Johnson is a spunky FBI agent who is suddenly snatched off a Chicago street while picking up her dry cleaning.  She also happens to be the daughter of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Jack Reacher is in the neighborhood, and he is kidnapped along with Holly.  Do the bad guys immediately kill him just as they kill almost everyone else they get their hands on? Of course not!<br /><br />\\"Die Trying\\" deals with a right wing militia based in (where else?) Montana, led by a disgusting villain named Beau Borken.  Borken wants to set up his own country, since he is convinced that the United States has become a corrupt and unfriendly place.  Kidnapping Holly Johnson is just one element in his master plan to lash out at the United States government.<br /><br />Borken and his henchmen do not take Jack Reacher's skills into consideration when they decide to let him live.  Reacher can shoot any weapon, and he has an encyclopedic knowledge of trajectory and bullet speed.  He is a tremendous marksman and can kill anyone with his bare hands in a matter of seconds.  Reacher can almost always anticipate what the bad guys are planning and he generally comes up with a clever plan to stop them. On top of all these qualities, he is fearless, compassionate, intuitive, and loyal.<br /><br />\\"Die Trying\\" is extremely violent, even within the conventions of this genre.  Not only is the body count very high, but the people who die do not go gently into that good night.  They often suffer agonizing and gruesome deaths.  Beau Borken is a hissable villain, although he is so obviously insane that it is hard to imagine why anyone would listen to him.<br /><br />Although this is a fast moving and action-packed thriller,  the plot make little sense and the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes.  Child has written what is basically a macho fairy tale for fans of escapist adventure novels.	2001-08-16

The quiet town of Eastvale in Yorkshire is rocked by an anti-nuclear demonstration that turns violent.  A police constable named Edwin Gill is stabbed to death during the demonstration and Inspector Alan Banks is on the case.  Unfortunately, his superior is not the supportive and sensible Superintendent Gristhorpe but &quot;Dirty Dick&quot; Burgess, a sadistic, chauvanistic, hard-drinking CID Superintendent who has a hatred for &quot;commies&quot; and hippie-types.  Burgess roars into town and immediately starts threatening the locals, using his bullying style of interrogation to get results.<br />With Sandra and the kids out of town for a few weeks, Banks has plenty of time to follow a few leads of his own.  Most of his suspicions are centered around a commune known as &quot;Maggie's Farm,&quot; where some sixties-type people live together.  One of the residents, Paul Boyd, is a particularly suspicious character, since he has a lengthy police record.  Banks wants to find out if Officer Gill was murdered deliberately or if his killing was merely a random act of violence.<br />&quot;A Necessary End&quot; is not notable for being a scintillating mystery.  The resolution of the story is a bit anti-climactic.  What Robinson does well is develop character.  From the brutal Dick Burgess to the gentle and loving Mara (who lives in the commune), each character comes alive as a result of Robinson's vivid descriptive writing and realistic dialogue.  I recommend &quot;A Necessary End&quot;.  It is a well-paced novel that is also filled with colorful and authentic Yorkshire atmosphere.	2001-08-12

What is the difference between Peter Robinson and most other mystery writers?  If you have read any of this author's marvelous Inspector Banks novels, then you will know the answer.  The other authors are sketch artists, while Robinson is an Impressionist master.<br />Robinson doesn't merely present a mystery for the readers to solve along with the protagonist.  Robinson creates a distinctive setting and fully realized characters along with the mystery.  The result is a novel that satisfies and leaves the reader eager for the next installment.<br />&quot;Gallows View&quot; sets up the Inspector Banks series nicely.  It introduces Alan Banks, a detective who left London to work in Eastvale, a town in Yorkshire, where he lives with his wife and two children.  Banks has a good working relationship with his superior, Gristhorpe, and with the other members of the police department in Eastvale.  Banks is a flawed man.  He is addicted to cigarettes, likes to imbibe his pint, and he has an eye for pretty ladies (although he wants to remain faithful to this wife).<br />The center of Banks's life is his relentless pursuit of justice, and his terrific instinct for how the criminal mind works.  In &quot;Gallows View,&quot; Banks investigates three different crimes:  A Peeping Tom is terrorizing the women of Eastvale, a pair of thugs is robbing both the elderly and some rich residents of the town, and an elderly woman has been found dead.  In the course of his investigation, we get to know how Banks operates and we also get inside the mind of the perpetrators.<br />In &quot;Gallows View,&quot; Robinson explores the emotional and sexual tension between men and women and the difficulties of being a single parent.  He does all this without preaching, and the themes are woven seamlessly into the story.<br />The solution to the crimes is not surprising or particularly exciting, but the character development is excellent and it is always a pleasure to be in the company of Inspector Alan Banks.

Having already read three other Jack Reacher novels, I finally got around to reading \\"Killing Floor,\\" the first in Lee Child's popular series.  Here is the Jack Reacher that we know and love--macho wanderer, man of few words, quick with his fists, an expert at weaponry, fearless and unforgiving.<br /><br />Jack is passing through Margrave, Georgia.  It is a town that is surprising clean and well-kept, considering that most of the residents have little visible source of income.  Jack intends to stay for a brief period to look up some history about a blind musician, and then he intends to move on.  However, Jack is arrested for a vicious crime that he did not commit, and he then becomes embroiled in a murder investigation that involves his brother.<br /><br />It turns out that Margrave is a corrupt town, rotten to the core.  With the help of a few good police officers (one of whom makes for a sexy love interest), Reacher gets to the heart of an extremely profitable criminal operation run by some very ruthless and powerful men. \\"Killing Floor\\" is a fast-moving, engrossing and extremely violent thriller.  Reacher is quick-witted, unerring in his instincts, and relentless in his pursuit of justice.  One of Reacher's quirks is that he rarely changes his clothes, since he hates to be bothered with laundry.  Since he never carries luggage and he only showers when he gets a chance, he must be fairly malodorous.  Surprisingly, no one seems to notice.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"Killing Floor,\\" recognizing it for the entertaining fairy tale that it is.  Child does not try for realism.  If you can stomach tremendous carnage and you like non-stop action, then you will enjoy \\"Killing Floor\\".	2001-08-05

Peter Clement, in his new novel, &quot;Mutant,&quot; goes to great pains to explain how dangerous it is to tinker with the genetic makeup of foods, people and animals.  Using scientific jargon, Clement explains that once diseases cross species barriers, an illness like the flu can be fatal to millions of people.  Even Ebola can theoretically be transmitted by genetically altering the food supply.  Not only can accidents occur, but evil scientists have the capability of purposely altering genes in order to harm large numbers of innocent people.  This is a serious subject which should receive thoughtful treatment.  &quot;Mutant&quot; does not succeed in giving this subject the weight it deserves.<br />The spunky heroine of this novel is Dr. Kathleen Sullivan, a gorgeous woman with a fiery temper and tremendous intelligence.  Her counterpart is Dr. Richard Steele, a troubled ER doctor who gets involved in the anti-bioengineering movement.  Both Steele and Sullivan endanger their lives to get to the bottom of an evil scheme to &quot;strike at the heart of America&quot;.<br />What brings this novel down are the cliches that Clement uses in his plot and in his writing. An example is this passage from the novel describing  an attack on Dr. Steele by a pair of killer dogs:  &quot;He [Dr. Steele] felt locked into their stares, paralyzed by the blood lust he saw burning in their molten pupils and reading in them a hunger as primeval as that of any jungle beast.&quot;  This is very bad writing.<br />In addition, Clement relies on one of the biggest cliches of all.  It seems that a Middle Eastern madman (who could it be?) wants some deadly bioengineered DNA let loose on a large number of Americans.  A mysterious American is helping this madman to achieve his nefarious goal.  If you have not figured out who the mastermind of the evil plan is by the halfway point of this book, then you are simply not paying attention.<br />Other cliches are Dr. Steele's inability to deal with the loss of his wife and the very hackneyed ending, with its &quot;perils of Pauline&quot; pseudo-drama.<br />Do you want true thrills without the nonsense?  Go back to the classic of all time, Michael Crichton's &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;.  When I read this great novel so many years ago, I was truly frightened and educated.  The movie was great, too.

Elizabeth George's latest entry in her Lynley/Havers series is &quot;A Traitor to Memory&quot;.  It differs from her previous novels in that it is more intensely psychological and less plot driven.  In fact, a great portion of the book is given over to the reminiscences of a psychiatric patient to his doctor.<br />The patient is Gideon Davies, a former child prodigy and a virtuoso on the violin.  He has suddenly lost his ability to play the violin and he cannot understand what has happened to him.  In an effort to recapture his musical gift, Gideon starts to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Rose, who urges him to delve into his past in order to come to terms with whatever it is that is troubling him.<br />Gideon's past is a tortured and convoluted one.  He had a developmentally disabled sister named Sonia who drowned at the age of two and the circumstances surrounding her death have never been completely clarified.  Gideon's parents, Richard and Eugenie, divorced after their daughter's death, and Gideon's grandfather suffered from recurring bouts of madness throughout his later life.  To top it all off, Gideon's father is a stern taskmaster.  He is obsessed with Gideon's talent, and he insists that Gideon's music is the most important thing in their lives.<br />Inspector Lynley and Constable Havers become involved in the lives of the Davies family when a series of hit and run &quot;accidents&quot; prove to be murder and it becomes increasingly obvious that the events surrounding Sonia's death twenty years ago have reached into the present.<br />As usual, George creates realistic dialogue and a large, fascinating cast of characters.  These include Gideon's obsessive father, the violinist's bohemian girlfriend Libby (who tries to rescue him from his torment), and Katja Wolff, the German nanny who took the blame for Sonia's death.  Was Katja really at fault for Sonia's death or was she protecting someone else?<br />Unfortunately, &quot;A Traitor to Memory&quot; falters at the end.  At seven hundred pages, the book goes on at least a hundred pages too long and the plot begins to unravel.  There are too many murders that muddy the waters, and the characters act too melodramatically to be believed.  However, even with these flaws, Elizabeth George effectively explores the terrain of dysfunctional families, the dangers of obessession, and a favorite topic of mystery writers--how events of the distant past often have disastrous consequences many years later.

Bakersville, Oregon is the setting for Lisa Gardner's novel, &quot;The Third Victim&quot;.  Bakersville is a small, sleepy town where nothing much happens and where everyone knows everyone else's business.  Police Officer Lorraine Conner, known as Rainie, has a history in Bakersville.  Everyone knows that fourteen years ago, Rainie's alcholic mother, who abused Rainie and who was openly promiscuous, was brutally murdered.  Townfolk still speculate as to whether Rainie killed her mother, and Rainie has learned to live with the rumors.<br />Bakersville's peace is shattered when three people, a teacher and two students, are gunned down in the town's elementary school.  More shocking, the killer appears to be Danny O'Grady, the thirteen-year-old son of Bakersville's sheriff, Shep O'Grady.  Shep had taught Danny a great deal about guns, and apparently, Danny had put this knowledge to use when killing his victims.<br />Rainie is the primary officer investigating the case and she has conflicting loyalties.  She is devoted to Shep, and she would like to help his son, but she is also a peace officer who is sworn to uphold the law.  Rainie's life is complicated when federal and state officers get involved in her case.  She is romantically attracted to FBI agent Pierce Quincy, a profiler who is assigned to the case.  Quincy is a recurring character in Gardner's books.<br />In &quot;The Other Victim,&quot; Gardner tackles some interesting subjects well.  She explores the phenomenon of school shootings, including why they occur and what might be done to prevent them in the future.  She also deals ably with the subjects of child abuse, marital discord and children's phobias.  Rainie is an excellent protagonist, strong yet vulnerable, and her romance with Quincy is engrossing.  Most of the characters, including the sheriff and his wife, and the various police officers assigned to the case, are well drawn.<br />The problem with the book is the perpetrator.  Gardener makes the murderer into an omniscient type who pulls the strings of all the characters throughout the book in a way that I found to be unbelievable.  The character of the murderer does not ring true and I found the ending to be the weakest part of the book.<br />However, Gardner's crisp dialogue and her excellent protagonist, Rainie Conner, keep the book moving at a brisk pace, and &quot;The Third Victim&quot; did hold my interest until the end.

Jan Burke, in her thriller &quot;Bones,&quot; tells the story of a serial killer named Nicholas Parrish, who is as intelligent and organized as he is deranged and malevolent.  Parrish kills and dismembers scores of women and even after he is caught, he continues to wreak havoc.<br />The heroine of &quot;Bones&quot; is Irene Kelly, a newspaper reporter who has been interested for years in the disappearance of Julia Sayre, a young mother of two.  Kelly is happily married to Frank Harriman, a homicide detective.  Because of her interest in the Sayre case, Kelley accompanies a search team into the mountains, with Parrish under armed guard.  Parrish has agreed to reveal the site where he has buried Julia Sayre.  Unfortunately, the trip turns out to be a disaster for the search team and it leads to unspeakable violence and tragedy.<br />Throughout the many ordeals that she faces, Irene proves to be resourceful, resilient, compassionate and courageous.  Irene has met her match in Parrish, however, who seems to have an uncanny sense of how to exploit people's weaknesses.  Parrish is aided by an unknown accomplice, whom he dubs &quot;the Moth&quot;.<br />There are aspects of this novel that are very good.  Burke creates strong and vivid characters.  One of the best is a dog named Bingle, who is an expert at finding cadavers and who answers only to commands in Spanish.  There is a tortured anthropologist named Ben Sheridan, whose gruff exterior hides inner pain.  Burke nicely depicts the relationship between Irene and her husband Frank, who is a &quot;dream husband,&quot; warm, caring and supportive.<br />Another interesting aspect of this novel is the information that it contains on tracking dogs and on forensic anthropology.  Burke has done her research well and the book is richer because of all the background information that it provides.<br />Parrish, on the other hand, is a formulaic serial killer.  Abused as a child, he is merciless to his victims; in fact, he revels in their pain.  He is the &quot;Hannibal Lecter&quot; type, which I have seen too often in recent fiction.  &quot;Bones&quot; has other weaknesses.  The dialogue tends to be stilted and the book meanders a bit at times.<br />However, Burke redeems the novel with a surprise at the end that I did not see coming.

Elinor Lipman creates off-the-wall characters (generally misfits), who have difficulty keeping jobs and maintaining relationships.<br />In her latest novel, &quot;The Dearly Departed,&quot; Margaret Batten and her lover Miles Finn are found dead, the victims of a defective furnace that leaked carbon monoxide.  Brought together for the funeral are Sunny Batten and Fletcher Finn, two half-siblings who never knew of one another's existence.  Sunny and Fletcher are both at loose ends and they are dissatisfied with their lives.  When they come to the small New Hampshire town of King George to bury their parents, they also try make peace with the past and figure out where they are headed in life.<br />Sunny revisits the people with whom she grew up, and she finds romance with the Chief of Police, Joey Loach.  Joey had a crush on Sunny in high school.  Although he is now a respected peace officer, Joey is also a stifled mama's boy straining to get out from under his mother's ministrations.  This book is filled with comic characters, such as Dr. Emil Ouimet, who, although married, harbored a deep (albeit unrequited) passion for Margaret Batten over the years.  The doctor publicly and embarrassingly falls apart at Margaret's funeral, and he continues to cry at the drop of a hat for days afterward.<br />What makes Lipman's books unique is her light touch with plot and characters.  Everything is played for laughs and even sudden death is fodder for the author's droll humor.  The characters trade witticisms, insults and assorted bon mots on every page and their repartee is entertaining and outrageous.  For a light comedy of manners with characters too funny to be true, pick up Lipman's &quot;The Dearly Departed&quot;.	2001-07-08

Steve Martini delivered genuine thrills in two of his early novels, &quot;Prime Witness&quot; and &quot;Compelling Evidence&quot;.  What those books supplied were engrossing characters, interesting legal maneuvers and mysteries that kept the reader guessing until the end.<br />Unfortunately, Martini's latest novel, &quot;The Jury,&quot; supplies none of these elements, and as a legal thriller, it is a dud.<br />The victim in this book is a gorgeous African-American woman named Kalista Jordan, who is also a brilliant research scientist.  She is brutally murdered after exiting her hot tub. Paul Madriani is hired to defend the accused killer--Jordan's boss, David Crone.  Jordan and Crone have worked together on some cutting-edge research involving genetics, and their working relationship was marred by serious disagreements that may have led to murder.<br />&quot;The Jury&quot; has numerous flaws.  Martini brings none of his characters to life.  Crone and Jordan are little more than cardboard cutouts, and Madriani has very little to do in this novel, other than stand up in court and parry with witnesses.  The mystery itself is not compelling in the least.  Even the title is problematical, since it implies that the book has something to do with jury deliberations.  It doesn't.  &quot;The Jury&quot; has very little action and the conclusion is out of left field and unsatisfying.  This novel is a real disappointment to those of us who have enjoyed Steve Martini's legal thrillers in the past.	2001-07-08

I enjoyed &quot;Running Blind&quot; and &quot;Tripwire&quot; very much; they were action-packed, clever and funny, and their villains were not only nasty, but unique in their villainy.  Jack Reacher is the prototype of the strong, silent hero.  You don't mess with this giant of a man who is not only clever and deadly, but also sensitive and compassionate (as all true heroes should be.)  Unfortunately, &quot;Echo Burning&quot; lacks some of the elements that have made Jack Reacher novels so fascinating and so much fun in the past.<br />In this novel, Jack is on the road with no girlfriend, no destination and no suitcase, as usual.  Reacher carries only a toothbrush and some money.  He discards his clothes and replaces them, when necessary.  (He probably doesn't smell too good most of the time.) Reacher is picked up by a Mexican beauty named Carmen Greer, who recruits him to help her out of an abusive marriage to her brute of a husband, Sloop Greer.  Reacher has no particular plans, so he decides to go along with Carmen to the Texas ranch where she lives with Sloop (now in prison, but soon to be released), her six-year-old daughter and Sloop's racist family.<br />It turns out that Sloop and his friends have a few secrets that, if revealed, would be embarrassing, and the need to keep these secrets leads to bloodshed.  In &quot;Echo Burning,&quot; however, the villains are not too compelling and the ending is telegraphed and too slow in coming.  Worst of all, the identity of the mastermind behind the bloodshed is fairly obvious before the climax of the book, and this makes the conclusion fairly pedestrian.  Unintentionally laughable is the fact that Reacher now seems to have psychic powers.  He puts himself in the place of the villains and imagines what they would do next.  He never seems to guess wrong.<br />To pull off a good action novel of this type, an author needs to keep the pace fast, the plot at least somewhat logical and surprising, and the dialogue crisp and, preferably, laced with wry humor.  &quot;Echo Burning&quot; fails on all counts.  However, I still have high hopes for the next Jack Reacher novel.eds to keep the pace fast, the plot at least somewhat logical and surprising, and the dialogue crisp and, preferably, laced with wry humor.  &quot;Echo Burning&quot; fails on all counts.

The central character is Rebecca, a fifty-three year-old widow who is feeling like &quot;an impostor in her own life&quot;.  Rebecca dropped out of college to marry Joe Davitch, a man much older than she, and she became stepmother to his three daughters.  She and Joe later have a daughter of their own.  With Joe gone, Rebecca is saddled with responsibilities. Among them is the planning and running of parties for profit in their house, &quot;The Open Arms&quot;.  By default, she is also the chief caregiver for Poppy, her late husband's uncle, who is almost one hundred years old and more than a little cranky and forgetful.<br />Rebecca is a member of the &quot;sandwich generation&quot;.  Without a husband to help her, she needs to be all things to all people--entrepreneur, mother, grandmother and daughter.  But what about Rebecca's needs?  Who caters to her?  Where is she supposed to get warmth and nurturing?  In an effort to recapture the girl of her youth, Rebecca tries to reconnect with her old boyfriend, to see if she made a terrible mistake when she jilted him so many years ago.<br />Anne Tyler's novel shows that life in a large family can be difficult--both confusing and exhausting.  A person like Rebecca Davitch, who is used to giving to others, may lose her own identity.  On the other hand, a large and close-knit family like the Davitches is a source of life and hope for the future.  In &quot;Back When We Were Grownups,&quot; Tyler explores the messiness and chaos of life in a large family, with all of its angst as well as all of its wonderful rewards.  Tyler's wry humor, her unusual characters and her psychological insight make this an entertaining novel.	2001-07-01

Malika Oufkir is a household name among those who watch Oprah Winfrey's show.  &quot;Stolen Lives,&quot; the story of the Oufkir family's imprisonment by the government of Morocco, was chosen as an Oprah Book Club selection and it is now a best-seller.  Malika Oufkir's story is a fairy tale in reverse.  She started life as a pampered princess.  The King of Morocco took her into his care at the age of five, and she was brought up as a spoiled young lady, with every luxury at her fingertips.  In 1972, everything changed.  Oufkir's father, a trusted and powerful aide of the King, was arrested and executed after an attempted coup.  In retaliation for her father's act of treachery, Malika, along with her five siblings and her mother, were imprisoned by the king for twenty years.<br />Oufkir wrote this book, which details her life before, during and after her family's imprisonment, with the help of a Tunisian writer named Michele Fitoussi.  The writing is not particularly strong.  &quot;Stolen Lives&quot; is often disjoined and repetitious and the characterizations are shallow.  Although it is under three hundred pages, the tepid writing makes it seem longer, and the narrative drags at times.  Oufkir's messages are hammered home repeatedly.  She rightly emphasizes that we should appreciate the &quot;free&quot; things in life, such as our liberty, our ability to see a sunrise, and the love of our family.  Oufkir also strongly criticizes the repressive Moroccan regime, whose human rights abuses are similar to those of other repressive regimes in many parts of the world.  Malika attributes her family's miraculous survival under often squalid conditions to divine intervention as well as to her family's ingenuity, love and tenacious desire to live.  The best parts of &quot;Stolen Lives&quot; are Malika's descriptions of how her family improvised while under extreme duress.  They rigged up a primitive communications system when they were in solitary confinement, they constructed toys out of scraps for Malika's little brother, and they even put on theatricals to amuse themselves.  Although &quot;Stolen Lives&quot; is often depressing and it is inelegantly written, this book demonstrates the unshakable will of human beings to survive under the most horrendous conditions.d toys out of scraps for Malika's little brother, and they even put on theatricals to amuse themselves.

Buffa's latest novel, &quot;The Judgment,&quot; two judges are brutally murdered.  The first is Calvin Jeffries, a brilliant but sadistic judge who had many enemies. The second murdered judge is Quincy Griswald, Jeffries's replacement on the bench.  Jeffries's murderer turns out to be a homeless man who apparently kills himself while in prison.  Griswald's accused murderer is also a homeless man, and attorney Joseph Antonelli decides to defend this man whom he believes to be innocent.  Antonelli is convinced that the deaths of the two judges are not coincidental and he is further convinced that Elliot Winston, a former attorney who was horribly betrayed by Jeffries, is somehow connected to these deaths.  How can Elliot be responsible, however, when he has been locked up in a state mental hospital for over a decade?<br />Complicating Antonelli's life is the sudden reappearance of Jennifer Frazier, his first love and a girl whom he has never been able to forget.  Jennifer and Antonelli try to reestablish a loving relationship, but they face a formidable obstacle.  Jennifer suffers from manic-depression, and her condition can deteriorate at any time.<br />Buffa's courtroom scenes are exciting, as Antonelli uses every tactic he knows to cast reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case against his child-like client.  &quot;The Judgment&quot; has some clever elements and  Buffa conveys an important message about the elusive nature of justice in this world.  The ending, however, is way over the top.  Buffa resorts to melodrama and illogical plotting to give his book a slam-bang ending.  Notwithstanding this weakness, however, &quot;The Judgment&quot; is an engrossing legal thriller.	2001-06-11

Michael Cunningham, in his book &quot;The Hours,&quot; depicts three women who are going through similar crises in their lives.  One is the troubled and talented author, Virginia Woolf.  Woolf's recurrent episodes of madness are so frightening and disturbing to her that she finally resorts to suicide by drowning.  The second woman is Laura Brown, a pregnant housewife who lives in California after World War II with her husband and her three-year-old boy.  Laura is not content.  Every day on earth is a torment to her.  One of her few comforts is being by herself and reading Virginia Woolf's novel, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;.  Laura cannot see herself surviving day after dreary day as a housewife and mother into the distant future.  Laura contemplates her options.  Should she kill herself or run away?<br />The third woman is Clarissa Vaughan, an editor living in  Greenwich village.  One of Clarissa's oldest friends, Richard, is dying of AIDS.  Richard has called Clarissa &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; for years.  As she watches Richard waste away, Clarissa begins to take stock of her own life.  Clarissa lives with her female lover and their daughter.  However, Clarissa often feels disconnected from her loved ones, and she is sometimes overwhelmed by her life.<br />All three of these heroines are persistently and painfully introspective.  No part of their lives is unexamined and this close scrunity of every aspect of their existence brings these women more pain than enlightenment.  Although I admire Cunningham's ability to write with subtley and grace, and although I sympathize with the plight of women who feel out of step with the world, I did not enjoy &quot;The Hours&quot;.  I found it too dark and devoid of hope, a novel that emphasizes the most negative aspects of being a woman.	2001-06-11

I have read a number of Anita Shreve's books, and &quot;The Weight of Water&quot; resembles her other works in several ways.  Shreve relies heavily on the atmosphere of the New England coast to set the mood of her novels.  In &quot;The Weight of Water,&quot; the setting is the Isles of Shoals, an archipelago near the coast of New Hampshire.  The rocky and forbidding landscape, with its harsh weather and sudden squalls, is a mirror of the characters' stormy and often destructive feelings and actions.  &quot;The Weight of Water&quot; follows a few days in the life Jean and Thomas Janes, a married couple who have become insecure in their relationship with one another.  They, along with their young daughter Billie, are on a boat belonging to Rich, Thomas's brother, and Adaline, Rich's girlfriend.  Jean, a photographer, is on assignment, taking photographs of a site on the Isles of Shoals where two Norwegian immigrant women were brutally murdered in 1873.  Jean finds a diary written by a survivor of the murder, and this diary serves as a backdrop for the events of the present time.<br />The story of the Norwegian woman who survives the murders, Maren Christensen Hontvedt, is a compelling one.  Maren emigrates to America reluctantly with her husband, John.  Shreve, through Maren's diary, beautifully portrays Maren's emotional torment as she leaves her native land and sets up house in this inhospitable climate.  Later, Maren and John are joined by other members of their families.  How did Maren's sister-in-law and sister come to be brutally murdered one horrible night?  Shreve gives her own interpretation to these events, and it is ghastly as well as mesmerizing.  The &quot;main&quot; story of Thomas and Jean cannot compete with the &quot;secondary&quot; story of Maren and her family in terms of emotional resonance and intensity.  Still &quot;The Weight of Water&quot; is notable for Shreve's mapping of the landscape of the Isle of Shoals as well as of the human heart.  Why do we destroy ourselves and others?  How much suffering can we take before we snap?  Shreve is an expert at dissecting the fragile heart of a woman.<br />This book is a companion piece to &quot;The Last Time They Met,&quot; Shreve's latest novel, since both books deal with the life of Thomas Janes.eart.

She is the daughter of Reb Mordche Rutner, the respected head of the Hasidim in the town of Krovnitz, Poland, during the 1930's.  Breindel is a member of a warm and loving family and she has everything that she desires.  Unfortunately, her life takes a wrong turn early on.  Breindel falls in love with a gentile, and when the relationship becomes public, she is hastily married off to a man she does not love.  Unfortunately, her new husband suffers from Messianic delusions, and she must flee from him to keep her own sanity.  Breindel's problems escalate throughout the book.  Besides having to flee from place to place to escape bad relationships, Breindel suffers horribly during WWII.  The Nazis bring death and destruction to Polish Jewry.  Many members of Breindel's family die, and she must use her ingenuity to keep herself and her child alive from day to day.  The author of this novel, Helaine Helmreich, has created a strong and spirited heroine who evoked my sympathy and interest.  &quot;The Chimney Tree&quot; is a sad story of a woman whose life turns out to be far less idyllic than she could ever have imagined.	2001-06-03

Peter Robinson's &quot;Wednesday's Child&quot; is about the abduction of a young girl named Gemma by a man and woman posing as child care workers.  They take Gemma from her negligent and abusive mother who is too ignorant to realize that this couple are a pair of impostors .  In addition, a low-class hoodlum is found viciously murdered near an abandoned smelting mill.  Are these two events related?  Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks and his colleagues, Superintendent Gristhorpe, Susan Gay and Phil Richmond, combine forces to uncover a cunning plan by a pair of malevolent criminals, one of whom is extremely dangerous and unpredictable. Robinson, as usual, captures the Yorkshire ambiance perfectly.  His ear for dialogue is uncanny and he has a remarkable talent for setting a scene perfectly and creating memorable characters.  The mystery and its solution are thoroughly satisfying.  &quot;Wednesday's Child&quot; is a wonderful and engrossing thriller by a master of the genre.	2001-05-30

Deborah Harrison is the affluent and intelligent daughter of an important businessman.  One day, on her way home from St. Mary's school, she is strangled in a graveyard.  The residents of the Yorkshire town of Eastvale are shocked by her death, and Deborah's father is pressuring the police to come up with a suspect quickly.  Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks is called in and he, along with his colleagues, arrest an English teacher for the crime.  Peter Robinson does some interesting things in &quot;Innocent Graves&quot;.  He tells a good part of the story through the eyes of the arrested man, Owen Pierce, who swears that he is innocent.  We experience Owen's panic and bitterness as he is processed through the criminal justice system and stands trial for a crime that he claims he did not commit.  Robinson once again shows how difficult and painstaking police work is.  Banks and his colleagues must interview dozens of people over a period of months to get to the truth.  The patience and the perseverance of the Eastvale police force are strained to the breaking point during this case. The ending is a bit melodramatic and not completely believable.

I have been reading Crombie's series for some time now, and &quot;A Finer End&quot; is one of her best efforts.  In this new mystery, Scotland Yard Detective Superintendent Duncan Kincaid is summoned by his cousin, Jack Montfort, to provide help with a sensitive matter.  Winnie Catesby, an Anglican priest and Jack's lover, has been hit by a car and left for dead.  Was this an accident or a deliberate attempt at murder?  Jack wants Duncan to look into the case and give his professional opinion.  Gemma James, Duncan's lover and former partner, has been promoted to Inspector, a move that has caused a rift between Gemma and Duncan.  Gemma comes with Duncan to Glastonbury, where Jack lives, to get away from the pressures of her new job for a few days.  Glastonbury is a town that features the ruins of an ancient abbey.  It is also a tourist attraction for New Agers who come to get in touch with the powerful spiritual forces that are reputed to be centered there. Crombie's book features a fascinating cast of characters, including Simon Fitzstephen, a Church scholar with dark secrets and Garnet Todd, an eccentric woman who is terrified of the forces of darkness that she believes are present in Glastonbury.  Soon after Winnie's &quot;accident,&quot; another resident of the town is murdered.  Kincaid and James get embroiled in the passions of a place where feelings of fear and anger have been festering for many years.  &quot;A Finer End&quot; is a psychological mystery that is also rich in history, spirituality and romance.  The mystery is intriguing and satisfying, with enough red herrings to keep the reader guessing until the end.  I recommend &quot;A Finer End&quot; for fans of atmospheric British police procedurals.	2001-05-27

For reasons that elude him, Jeff has no sense of direction and no zest for life.  Jeff's memory of his past is weirdly devoid of any emotion or any sense of reality.  Jeff suffers panic attacks when he very occasionally ventures out of his apartment; he spends many mind-numbing hours in front of the television.  When and how did Jeff become a near-zombie?  Why does he have only two patients?  Jeff's life takes a turn for the worse when he is attacked by thugs who burst into his apartment.  Soon he is on the run from unknown assailants who want him dead.  Jeff is accompanied by a beautiful lawyer, Adrienne Cope.  Adrienne's sister was a patient of Jeff before her untimely demise.  What are the circumstances surrounding the sister's strange death?  Jeff and Adrienne travel to such places as New York, Florida, West Virginia and Zurich in an effort to find the individuals who have the information that they need. The Hougans put in quite a few touches of wry humor to liven up the proceedings.  Adrienne and Jeff banter with one another amusingly.  They are attracted to one another, and we wonder if they will act on their attraction.  Unfortunately, the book goes on for 450 pages and it is at least a hundred pages too long.  Before the end of the novel, the mystery loses steam, and I longed for the book to come to its predictable conclusion.  With tighter editing, and a little less predictability, &quot;The Syndome&quot; could have been a much tidier thriller.	2001-05-25

Mary Higgins Clark's latest novel, &quot;On the Street Where You Live,&quot; breaks no new ground.  It is reminiscent of her earlier and better book &quot;Remember Me,&quot; which dealt with how the distant past may affect the present.  Emily Graham is a criminal defense attorney who buys a house that once belonged to a distant ancestor.  Three murders of young women that occurred in the late 19th Century seem to be related to a series of contemporary murders in the New Jersey town, Spring Lake, where Emily has now settled.  Emily starts to dig into the history of the town, looking for a clue that will reveal the identity of the present-day serial killer who preys on young women.  Of course, Emily is on the killer's hit list.  Clark populates the books with quite a few suspects, but anyone who has read Clark's books will guess the identity of the murderer before long.  Emily and the other characters do not come to life, since they are cardboard cut-outs with few distinguishing characteristics.  The plot plays out in predictable fashion.  I will say this in favor of Mary Higgins Clark:  Her novels are squeaky clean, with no hint of profanity and very little violence.  Adolescent girls and elderly ladies can read her books with pleasure, knowing that they will have a few hours of escapist reading with no fear of being offended.  There is a place in fiction for escapist mysteries and Mary Higgins Clark is the undisputed queen of this genre.	2001-05-13

James is back with another Adam Dalgliesh mystery.  Adam is investigating a series of murders in St. Anselm's Theological College, a small institution on the coast of East Anglia.  St. Anselm's is a troubled place, since it is scheduled to close and the future of the priests and the students is uncertain.  The trouble starts when the dead body of a young man, the son of a wealthy businessman, is found buried in a mound of sand.  Did Ronald Treeves kill himself, did he have an accident, or was he murdered?  Commander Adam Dalgliesh and his expert investigative team doggedly pursue every lead, interviewing the residents of St. Anselm's, and they uncover more than a few dirty secrets during their inquiries.  Soon, the dead bodies start piling up alarmingly.  As usual, James develops her characters well and they are a colorful and varied lot.  The problem is with the mystery itself.  It is too convoluted, and James provides lengthy explanations at the end of the book to try to bring all the threads together.  Dalgliesh is his usual no-nonsense self;  it is obvious that this dogged and tough detective will not rest until the killer is brought to justice.  James teases us with a hint of romance betweem Dalgliesh and a teacher named Emma, but this relationship is peripheral to the main action.  &quot;Death in Holy Orders&quot; is a workmanlike mystery, but it doesn't surprise and it doesn't thrill.  James's last book had more of the edgy quality which I have come to expect from this brilliant writer when she is at her best.	2001-05-08

Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks, with the help of his colleagues, investigates Rothwell's shady business dealings as well as his family and social contacts.  Banks discovers that Rothwell's life was a great deal more complicated than the police could ever have imagined.  Once again, Peter Robinson has created a fascinating character study of a man whose outward appearance is deceptive.  The book has many wonderful qualities.  It is full of colorful Yorkshire characters who are brought to life in exquisite and entertaining detail.  Robinson's descriptions of the beautiful English countryside are lovely.  The mystery is satisfying although the ending is a bit far-fetched.  I especially like the character of Inspector Banks,  who has always been a man of contradictions.  He is compassionate towards victims, but he can be ruthless and cruel when necessary.  Although he loves his wife, he all but ignores her when he is on a case.  He has little formal eduation, but he has a deep interest in music and literature.  Banks is one of the most interesting of all the British detective heroes and &quot;Final Account&quot; is a fine mystery in the Inspector Banks series.	2001-04-29

Although Ben is far from macho, he is a true idealist, and he is an aggressive and smart courtroom attorney.  Christina McCall, Ben's former legal assistant, has recently graduated from law school and she is now Ben's partner.  The case in this book deals with the horrible murder and mutilation of a policeman, Joe McNaughton, who was a popular man on the Tulsa police force.  McNaughton's cop buddies and his widow are sure that the killer is a nineteen-year-old stripper named Keri Dalcanton.  Keri was Joe's lover until he ended their torrid affair.  Ben faces formidable obstacles in his efforts to acquit Kerry.  First of all, there is strong circumstantial evidence linking Keri to Joe's murder.  In addition, several policemen have a vendetta against Ben and Keri in the form of &quot;the blue squeeze,&quot; which consists of physical and verbal harassment by the police.  As usual, Ben's case seems hopeless and dangerous.  However, he and his loyal staff battle the D. A. and the police with some clever tactics of their own.  As always, Ben and his cohorts are amusing and charming, and the case is complicated and involving.  There are plenty of red herrings to keep the reader guessing.  However, Bernhardt goes overboard in several areas.  There are graphic depictions of sadomasochistic and kinky sex that do not mix well with the gentle humor that pervades much of the book.  The ending is way over the top and the plot becomes extremely contrived in an effort to &quot;surprise&quot; the reader.  I enjoy a good surprise, but not at the expense of believability.  All in all, &quot;Murder One&quot; is a serviceable legal thriller, but Bernhardt should have toned down the sensationalism and made the plot play out a little more realistically.	2001-04-22

Peter Robinson is that most rare of mystery writers.  He is not satisfied with a corpse, a detective and some clues.  Robinson creates a complete world with three-dimensional characters who come alive for the reader.  In &quot;A Dedicated Man,&quot; the shrewd and dogged Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks investigates the death of Harry Steadman.  Harry was a former university professor, a man with no enemies who studied local history for fun.  Yet someone hated Harry enough to brutally murder him and dump his body in the Yorkshire dales.  For quite a while, Banks is completely stymied.  He questions Harry's widow and his small circle of friends, but Banks makes little progress.  Only after relentless digging and after the death of a second victim does Banks come up with the solution to the crime. It turns out that Harry's life and those of his friends are not as straightforward and uncomplicated as they had at first seemed.  What is wonderful about Robinson is that he makes police work look as tedious and difficult as it really is.  It is clear that without relentless and time-consuming detective work on the part of Banks and his colleagues, they would solve few crimes.  Robinson, along with Rendell and James, is a superb writer of novels that also happen to be first-rate mysteries.	2001-04-22

Now in their fifties, Linda and Thomas first fell in love in high-school, but they parted and lost touch for ten years.  When they were in their twenties, they met by chance while they were both living in Africa.  As the novel opens, Linda and Thomas get together to catch up on how they have spent the last several decades of their lives, and they analyze their painful past.  The next two parts of the book go back in time, first to their days together in Africa, and then to the time when Linda and Thomas were teenagers in love.  Shreve sets up the book like a jigsaw puzzle.  We get to know Thomas and Linda, and little by little we understand how and why they made the choices they did in life.  Shreve explores many themes in this book, such as how some devastating experiences can never be put behind us and how words are often inadequate to accurately capture the full range and depth of human emotion.  Although the ending is shocking and unanticipated, it is also powerful and gripping.  Shreve is an expert on how people, sometimes unwittingly and at other times, consciously, destroy one another and themselves.	2001-04-16

Inspector Banks, who is the sleuth in this series, is always fascinating.  He is a chain smoker who enjoys drinking.  He loves classical music, although he is not overly intellectual.  Banks truly shines in his ability to communicate with suspects in a murder investigation. Banks is the best interviewer in the business.  He has unerring intuition when it comes to spotting lies and evasions, and he has a way of getting people to reveal a great deal of themselves.  Most of all, he cares about seeing justice done, no matter how long it takes and no matter whom it may hurt. In this novel, a young amateur actress named Caroline Hartley is found brutally murdered.  She has had a tumultuous life, and any number of people might have had reason to kill her.  Banks interviews those who knew Caroline years ago, as well as those who were closely involved with her shortly before her death.  &quot;Past Reason Hated&quot; deals with such themes as struggling to come to terms with one's sexuality, the fears that cause people to commit irrational acts and the complicated and inexplicable nature of human relationships.  &quot;Past Reason Hated&quot; is an engrossing and satisfying psychological mystery.	2001-04-11

In &quot;Falling Slowly,&quot; Miriam and Beatrice Sharpe are two sisters who are the products of a loveless marriage.  However, instead of going out and grabbing happiness for themselves after they become adults, Miriam and Beatrice half-heartedly pursue careers and tepid, bloodless relationships with men.  At one point, Miriam meets a man, Simon Haggard, whom she loves and who makes her feel alive.  Unfortunately, Simon is a married man with children, and he is hardly a candidate for a long-term relationship.  Still another man comes into Miriam's life, Tom Rivers, but she is unwilling to commit herself to him.  Beatrice lives in a cloud of romantic ideals and, after retiring from playing the piano, she merely exists from day to day, without any real goals.  Why read about these two depressing women?  Brookner's strength is that she makes us care about Miriam and Beatrice, even though we would like to shake them.  They come across as intelligent women who could make better choices in their lives if they would wake up and see the possibilities in front of them.  Unfortunately, they never do.	2001-04-10

One noteworthy aspect of the &quot;Gideon Oliver books&quot; is the wonderful camraderie that exists between Gideon and his wife, Julie.  Rarely does a married couple add to a mystery novel, but Gideon and Julie are both intelligent and witty, and there is genuine chemistry between them.  &quot;Skeleton Dance&quot; takes place in the small French town of Les Eyzies-de-Tayac, home to many prehistoric fossils.  Gideon is there with Julie to do research for his new book, but he is sidetracked by the discovery of bones that are far from prehistoric.  A very amusing police inspector, named Lucien Jolie, is an old friend of Gideon, and together the two men try to figure out who is responsible for a series of mysterious murders.  The characters in the book, most of whom are eccentric scientists, are delightfully depicted and the tone is light throughout.  My only quibble is that the solution to the mystery is a bit forced, but I do recommend &quot;Skeleton Dance&quot; for fans of light mysteries.	2001-04-10

Sybylla devotes her life to helping her indigent clients, even though she receives very little appreciation for her efforts.  While defending a homeless client who has slashed and maimed a nine-year-old girl, Sybylla learns of a nefarious right-wing plot to undermine the jury system.  While investigating this plot, Sybylla places her life in jeopardy and she uncovers some horrible secrets concerning her parents.  Does this sound impossibly complicated and far-fetched?  Well, it is.  Although the author gets credit for creating Sybylla, who is an attractive and witty individual, the mystery gets more and more preposterous as the book wears on.  Ultimately, the sometimes witty dialogue and the compelling courtroom scenes do not make up for the weak and implausible story.	2001-04-02

In &quot;The Bonesetter's Daugher,&quot; Amy Tan explores the tortured relationship between a modern Chinese woman and her old-world mother.  Ruth Young has a busy life, trying to cope with her demanding job, her live-in lover and her needy, elderly mother.  Ruth and her mother, LuLing, love one another, but they are separated by a gulf of misunderstanding and by long-buried secrets.  Only after LuLing's health deteriorates does Ruth have a manuscript translated that her mother had written for her years ago in Chinese.  This manuscript reveals to Ruth how LuLing became the person she is today.  Ruth learns that her mother is a woman of deep feeling and courage, who suffered much heartache and disappointment during her years as a young woman in China.  &quot;The Bonesetter's Daughter&quot; has a lengthy flashback sequence that movingly depicts the details of LuLing's birth and her troubled early life.  Unfortunately, the ending (which takes place in the present) lacks the impact of the flashback sequences, and the resolutions of the conflicts in the novel are a little too pat.  However, I recommend this novel for Tan's deep understanding of what makes mothers and daughters love and hate each other, often at the same time.	2001-03-26

I looked forward to reading &quot;The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon&quot; by Richard Zimler, since the blurbs on the back of the book were glowing.  I have read many fictional accounts of the Inquisition in Portugal, and I am always moved by the suffering of the Jews who lived during this terrible time.  Zimler's book starts out well.  I found the characters, especially Abraham Zarco (brilliant mystic, manuscript illuminator and leader of his community) fascinating.  Twenty-year-old Berekiah Zarco, Abraham's nephew, is an enthusiastic and vivid narrator.  However, after Berekiah stops being an observer and starts becoming a sleuth, the book loses its momentum.  In a repetitious series of vignettes, Berekiah wanders around the neighborhood interviewing a variety of people, as he tries to find out who murdered his uncle.  Zimler presents us with a dizzying array of characters who flow in and out of the novel.  After a while, I lost track of the characters and I lost interest, as well.  What a shame, since Zimler does have a gift for describing this horrible chapter in the history of European Jewry.	2001-03-20

In her best novel yet, Lisa Scottoline has once again mined her knowledge of all things Italian and the result is pure gold.  &quot;The Vendetta Defense&quot; is the story of &quot;Pigeon Tony&quot; Lucia (he breeds and races pigeons), an elderly Italian gentleman who admits that he has killed his enemy, eighty-year-old Angela Coluzzi, in order to settle an ancient vendetta.  In a series of flashbacks, we learn the story of Tony Lucia and Angelo Coluzzi.  These two men were neighbors in a small town in Italy sixty years ago, and they were rivals for the hand of the beautiful Silvana.  Silvana chose Tony Lucia over Angelo Coluzzi, and Angelo, a rabid Fascist and a vicious thug, never forgave this betrayal.  Coluzzi spent his life doing everything that he could to destroy the Lucia family.  For over half a century, Tony has restrained his anguish, until the fateful day when he and Coluzzi finally have it out.  Judy Carrier, a hotshot lawyer in Bennie Rosato's all-female law firm, decides to take on Tony Lucia's seemingly hopeless case.  While trying this case, Judy risks her life, weathers exciting and nerve-wracking courtroom battles and finds love with Frank, Tony's gorgeous grandson.  Scottoline's novel is at times achingly poignant, especially during the flashbacks, and at other times, it is laugh-out-loud funny.  Scottoline is politically incorrect in her depiction of the old Italian men and young Italian mobsters who live in South Philly.  &quot;The Vendetta Defense&quot; works as a light and entertaining mystery, and I recommend it unreservedly.  Fans of Scottoline will fall in love with Judy and Pigeon Tony, and they will enjoy this wonderful novel immensely.	2001-03-15

Dunant's sensitive dialogue and psychological insights expose Anna's fear and vulnerability.  &quot;Mapping the Edge&quot; is an engrossing novel of suspense that shows how modern women struggle to have it all, but must often settle for much less.	2001-03-06

John Grisham, master of the legal thriller, has written a touching novel set in rural Arkansas in 1952.  Three generations of the Chandler family live on their farm, and their cash crop is cotton.  Although they have plenty to eat, thanks to a lavish vegetable garden, the Chandlers are dependent for income on their cotton crop.  Unfortunately, the cotton crop is not always reliable.  Weather conditions and cotton prices fluctuate and the Chandler family never seems to get ahead financially.  &quot;A Painted House&quot; is told through the eyes of a precocious seven-year-old named Luke Chandler.  Luke learns a great deal during this novel.  He witnesses acts of unspeakable violence and he must wrestle with his conscience as to whether he should reveal what he has seen.  As a result of his friendship with a teenage girl, Luke begins to learn about sexuality.  During a flood which threatens the Chandlers' cotton crop and the lives of their neighbors, Luke learns how to survive a crisis and to still keep faith that things will get better.  Grisham evokes beautifully the simple Baptist faith of the residents of this town and the generosity that neighbors bestow on other neighbors who are in need.  The author also nicely depicts the close and loving relationships in the Chandler family.  The characters are realistic and flawed  and the dialogue rings true.  &quot;A Painted House&quot; is a far cry from the legal thrillers that we are used to from Grisham, and it may disappoint some readers who are used to action thrillers.  Still, patient readers will be rewarded, since &quot;A Painted House&quot; has a wonderful texture all its own.  As a novel about a boy's journey from naivete to maturity, it is remarkably effective and moving.	2001-02-19

These include the reproductive rights of women vs. the rights of the unborn, the purchase of political influence by the wealthy and the powerful, and the destruction of privacy by the scandalmongers in the media.  Kerry Kilcannon, a Kennedyesque figure, has just won the Presidency of the United States by a narrow margin.  However, his hold on power is tenuous, since there are powerful forces arrayed against him.<br /><br />The first crisis of his administration occurs at Kilcannon's swearing in, when the conservative Chief Justice of the Supreme Court suddenly dies.  Kilcannon's most pressing task as President is to nominate a new Chief Justice who will be able to win Senate confirmation.  Kilcannon's choice has wide-ranging ramifications that come back to haunt his administration, and that lead to ferocious political confrontations.  Adding to Kilcannon's problems is the case of Mary Ann Tierney, a fifteen-year-old pregnant girl who wants to abort her hydrocephalic fetus, even though her pregnancy has passed the first trimester.  An abortion in this case is illegal, and a young and ambitious lawyer named Sarah Dash takes Mary Ann's case.  The Tierney case becomes a litmus test of the suitability of Kilcannon's nominee for the Supreme Court.  Because of this emotionally-charged case, Dash, Tierney and Kilcannon find themselves in the midst of a personal and political maelstrom.<br /><br />These and other plot lines play out over a very long 546 pages.  The book's length is one of its weaknesses.  The story loses steam before its long-awaited end.  Another flaw is the plot device of giving several of the major characters dark secrets that, if revealed, would cause them deep embarrassment.  This introduces a little too much melodrama and predictability into a book that otherwise has a great deal going for it.  On the plus side, the level of legal discourse in the book is sophisticated and enlightening.  Patterson makes us feel as if we are in the courtroom with Tierney and her parents, who legally oppose her abortion.  The author has done his homework thoroughly, and he skillfully brings the case to life.  Patterson also makes the ugly political machinations that go on in Washington seem very real and threatening.  Kilcannon, Caroline Masters (the Supreme Court nominee), Sarah Dash and Mary Ann Tierney are nicely drawn and the dialogue is crisp and realistic.  On the whole, \\"Protect and Defend\\" is an intelligent and fascinating look at the moral and social forces that are at the heart of political life in America today.legal discourse in the book is sophisticated and enlightening.

In &quot;Chinese Cinderella,&quot; Adeline Yen Mah has adapted the story of her loveless childhood for a younger audience.  Without watering down the misery and the bitterness that she suffered at the hands of her vicious stepmother and her cruel father, she writes in a way that children can easily understand.  Mah had few role models as a child, since her mother died shortly after she was born, and her stepmother loathed her.  Only her Grandfather Ye Ye and her Aunt Baba showed her any affection at all.  She was mercilessly abused by her parents and by her siblings.  Fortunately, Adeline was an accomplished student, and she gained a feeling of self-worth from her scholastic accomplishments.  Children who have felt lonely and unwanted can take heart from Adeline's story.  She persisted in trying to make something of her life, in spite of her lonely and depressing childhood.  For a more detailed story of Adeline Yen Mah's life, read &quot;Falling Leaves,&quot; which is written for an adult audience.

Ha Jin's novel, &quot;Waiting,&quot; is about Lin Kong, a gentle and scholarly man who is stuck in a loveless marriage with the stolid and dependable Shuyu, who was given to him in an arranged marriage.  He leaves Shuyu in the countryside with their daughter, Hua, and he becomes an army doctor.  The novel spans several decades, as Lin forms an attachment to a nurse named Manna, and decides to divorce his wife.  The novel has little plot.  Ha Jin concentrates on how Mao's Cultural Revolution changed the life of the Chinese, and how the social atmosphere in China from the sixties to the eighties limited the choices that men and women could make in work and in love.  Ha Jin explores the attempts of the characters to express themselves as individuals and, at the same time, do what is proper in the eyes of the state and of their fellow citizens.  How can they accumulate wealth without being denounced as bourgeois?  How can they find love when the State stands in their way?  Both Lin and Manna make difficult choices and they pay a price for their &quot;happiness&quot;.  Only Shuyu, who asks for nothing and gives of herself unstintingly, seems to emerge emotionally unscathed.  Ha Jin has written a touching and low-key novel that beautifully describes life in China from the Cultural Revolution through its aftermath.  He captures the feeling of rural China particularly well, describing the hardscrabble life that people live on a day to day basis.  The characters and dialogue are simple yet affecting.  Ha Jin seems to be saying that happiness, especially in a culture as constricting as that of China, is an elusive commodity.  People who are brought up to repress their feeling and emotions often forget how to feel and often do not even know what they want.  &quot;Waiting&quot; is a glimpse into a culture with which most Americans are completely unfamiliar.	2001-01-25

It features Sir John Fielding and his seventeen-year-old assistant, Jeremy Proctor.  Since Sir John is injured early on in the book as a result of a gunshot wound, he needs Jeremy more than ever to help him investigate a series of robberies and murders in an upscale section of London.  The victims claim that their attackers are a band of ruthless black men.  Jeremy, under the direction of his mentor, Sir John, conducts a thorough investigation to uncover who is really behind the sudden crime wave.  Sir John, Jeremy and the various characters who populate Bow Street and the surrounding areas of London are pleasant and engaging.  Alexander brings 18th Century London alive with authentic period detail, even including a visit with the renowned lexicographer, Samuel Johnson.  The ending of the book drags a bit, however, and the story takes a little too long to play out.  In addition, the author relies on a series of far-fetched coincidences to tie up the loose ends of the plot.  &quot;The Color of Death&quot; is a fairly entertaining novel, but I disagree with those who compare Sir John Fielding to Sherlock Holmes.  &quot;The Color of Death&quot; lacks the wit and the flavor of the best Sherlock Holmes mysteries.	2001-01-22

Sherri Szeman, in her novel, &quot;The Kommandant's Mistress,&quot; takes one risk after another.  She dares to play with time and setting, generally changing scenes and characters in the middle of a page, so that the reader must scramble to keep his bearings.  The Kommandant of the title, Max von Walther, professes to despise Jews, and he kills them without compunction.  Yet, he boldly takes a beautiful Jewish deportee into his office and his life, in spite of the protests of his furious wife.  Szeman tells her story from various points of view, first from the viewpoint of the Kommandant, then from the viewpoint of his mistress, and finally from the &quot;official viewpoint&quot;.  Another daring move is Szeman's presentation of often horrifying events without much embellishment.  She depicts the situtations as a series of snapshots, one after another, quickly and relentlessly.  For example, Szeman depicts the Kommandant's daughter, Ilse, repeating the vicious Jew-hating comments that she hears from her elders, each word coming out like a horrible profanity from the mouth of an innocent child.  In another scene, the Kommandant implores his mistress to take his gun and help him to commit suicide.  Will she pull the trigger?  The effect of this staccato narrative style is similar to a punch in the stomach.  It is traumatizing to contemplate constantly changing scenarios of deportations, physical and mental torture, and murder.  Szeman seems to be saying that there is no way to tell such a story in a linear way.  Only by being cryptic and non-linear can one begin to capture the emotional trauma of events that are not within the scope of most people's experience.  Szeman is a poet, as well as a novelist, and her novel at times approaches poetry in its tremendous emotional impact.  I highly recommend this book to readers who are interested in Holocaust literature that is challenging and thought-provoking.	2001-01-18

Kent Haruf, in &quot;Plainsong,&quot; describes some of the troubled people in the community of Holt, Colorado.  In alternating chapters, Haruf gives voice to the lonely and the lost.  There is Tom Guthrie, a high-school teacher whose marriage appears to be dying and Victoria Robideaux, a pregnant teenager whose mother cruelly locks her out of the house.  In this novel, Ike and Bobby, Tom's pre-teen children, learn some grown-up lessons about love, death and letting go.  Although they are very young, no one shelters Ike and Bobby from the harsh realities of life.  The McPhersons are two crusty old bachelors who are set in their ways until they are asked to perform a tremendous sacrifice in order to help Victoria during her pregnancy.  In his realistic dialogue, Haruf perfectly captures the nuances of emotion expressed by each character.  The author is particularly adept at describing the loneliness and despair that a person feels when he has lost a loved one, when his pride is wounded, or when he doesn't know how to face the future with dignity.  Another theme expertly explored in &quot;Plainsong&quot; is how the members of a community reach out to one another and provide support when such support is desperately needed.  This book is earthy, with graphic sexual situations, profanity and even a vividly described autopsy of a horse!  The book has a little humor, but it could have used a little more humor to offset some of the bleak and tragic situations that Haruf describes.  &quot;Plainsong&quot; is not always entertaining but it is an unflinching look at the troubles that tear people apart and sometimes bring them together.	2001-01-14

I recently reviewed &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; by Tracy Chevalier.  That book was a wonderfully realized account of what may have transpired in the life of the great Dutch artist, Jan Vermeer, at the time that he painted the lovely work named in the title.  Susan Vreeland's &quot;Girl in Hyacincth Blue,&quot; is a painting that also may be a Vermeer (we don't know for sure until the end).  She traces the history of the painting's owners starting in the 20th century and going back to 17th century Amsterdam.  The owners of the painting include, among others, a repressed professor whose father obtained the work under questionable circumstances, a married man who looks at the painting and remembers his first love with longing, and a poor woman who loves the aesthetic qualities of the painting but needs to sell it to support her family.  Vreeland explores the themes of how a beautiful work of art has different meaning for different people and how great art has a timeless quality that can survive for centuries.  She also explores the price that an artist must pay in order to fully realize his vision on canvas.  One problem with this novel is that Vreeland's vignettes are not equally involving.  For example, one chapter that deals with a marriage in dissolution is less interesting than the others.  In addition, as soon as the reader gets involved with one set of characters, the chapter ends and the characters disappear.  This constant change of cast makes the novel a bit choppy. On the plus side, Vreeland beautifully brings to life the relationship between humanity and great works of art.  She also skillfully depicts aspects of the culture and landscape of the Netherlands over the past four centuries.  One chapter that focuses on the very difficult struggle of Dutch farmers to keep the sea at bay is particularly vivid.  Vreeland's &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; is, overall, an uneven but often fascinating look at the creative process and the meaning that art brings to our lives.brings to our lives.	2001-01-14

Jeff Greenfield wrote \\"The People's Choice\\" in 1995. His book did not attract much attention then. The off-the-wall scenarios that Greenfield presents in this book seem to be a little less outlandish after our 2000 Presidential election fiasco. \\"The People's Choice\\" deals with a very close presidential race, which is won by the Republican candidates, MacArthur Foyle and his dim-bulb running mate, Ted Block. The problem arises when, in a photo-op, Foyle takes a fall from a horse, with disastrous consequences. The author explores the mysteries of the Electoral College, asking such pertinent questions as, \\"Who are the electors?\\" \\"How closely are they bound to voting for the candidate of their party?\\" \\"What kind of mayhem would ensue if the electors started a revolt and refused to vote for their party's candidate?\\" All of a sudden, after the recent debacle in Florida, these questions have real meaning. Greenfield's dialogue is devilishly savage and witty. He knows Washington politics inside and out. Greenfield presents a colorful cast of characters, including the super-reporter, Al DeRossa, the Machiavellian kingmaker, Jack Petitcon, whose behind the scenes machinations wreak havoc, and Dorothy Ledger, the elector from Michigan who nearly causes a Constitutional crisis. Greenfield deals with other interesting questions as well, such as, \\"What price does a politician pay for selling his soul to his party or to special interest groups?\\" and \\"What price do the reporters and campaign workers pay for slavishly following the candidates for weeks and months on end?\\" Satire is not easy to pull off, but in \\"The People's Choice,\\" Greenfield does a fine job of examining our political system with a humorous and knowing eye.	2001-01-07

In her medical thriller, &quot;Clinical Trial,&quot; April Christofferson explores the tragic plight of Native Americans who live on reservations.  She focuses in particular on the Blackfeet tribe of Montana, who suffer from poverty, substandard medical attention and exploitation by the white man.  The heroine is Dr. Isabel McLain, who left the world of high tech medicine to provide medical care for the Blackfeet tribe.  She encounters superstition and suspicion from her patients, but she gradually wins them over with her hard work and commitment.  Isabel is trying to forget her disastrous marriage to her malicious, soon to be ex-husband, Alistair.  The villains of the book are the aforementioned ex-husband, a greedy CEO of a mining company who wants to destroy tribal lands for the sake of profit, and another greedy CEO of a biotech company who also cares for nothing but profit.  Added to the mix is a handsome Native American named Monty Four Bear who is a leader and a tribal activist.  He is filled with rage at the white man's constant acts of treachery towards Native Americans.  &quot;Clinical Trial&quot; held my interest.  I loved Isabel, even though her character is somewhat formulaic; she is the typically spunky but vulnerable heroine.  Unfortunately, as the book progresses, Christofferson tries to cram too much plot into the novel.  Besides the story line with the evil mining company and the biotech company, there is a plot dealing with an FDA investigation involving Isabel and her nasty ex-husband, a tender love affair, a dangerous and disaffected Russian scientist who is also a madman, and a bunch of Native American activists who get involved in a violent confrontation with members of the mining company.  The ending is formulaic and more than a little melodramatic.  There were a few coincidences that were simply unbelievable.  Still, I recommend &quot;Clinical Trial,&quot; mostly because of the author's sensitive treatment of the plight of Native Americans and its nicely drawn heroine, Isabel McLain.nd its nicely drawn heroine, Isabel McLain.	2000-12-31

In a series of flashbacks from the 1940's, alternating with the present (1958, to be exact), Follett shows how a bunch of carefree college students go on to play crucial roles in the rivalry between the U. S. and the Soviet Union.  The U. S. S. R. has launched Sputnik, and the United States is attempting to keep pace by launching Explorer I.  The prestige of the United States hinges on the success of this launch.  However, someone may be attempting to sabotage the launch, thereby damaging the U. S. space program.  &quot;Code Zero&quot; starts out well.  I was interested in the lives of Luke, Elspeth, Billie and Anthony, who are attractive and intelligent college students with big plans for the future.  However, as the book progresses, it begins to sag.  Follett allows the plot to sink into melodramatic and predictable plotting, and the dialogue becomes banal.  The ending  (which should be exciting) lacks suspense, since it is obvious how the plot will turn out.  Too bad, because the book started out as good campy fun.	2000-12-27

I favorably reviewed James Powlik's first book, &quot;Sea Change,&quot; because it combined narrative excitement with authentic scientific background.  Powlik doesn't &quot;dumb down&quot; his extensive knowledge of biological oceanography for the layman.  In his new book, &quot;Meltdown,&quot; Powlik again displays his encyclopedic knowledge as he describes a cataclysm in the making.  It seems that there is a radioactive leak in the Arctic that poses a threat not just to the local inhabitants, but to mankind as a whole.  Powlik brings back two attractive characters from &quot;Sea Change,&quot; the formidable Dr. Carol Harmon and her ex-husband, the macho yet sensitive Brock Garner.  Two of Carol's crewmen aboard her research vessel have died suddenly and painfully, and she calls upon Garner to help her identify and contain the source of the problem.  Garner comes to the rescue with his sidekick, Zubov, and that is when the narrative starts to go awry.  The plot simply does not hold water (no pun intended).  It is way too convoluted, going off in far too many directions.  Powlik mixes in, among other plot lines, a heroic and poignant Eskimo and his dog, some clever use of bacteria and algae, several tepid love stories, a &quot;mad scientist&quot; who is brought in with his far-out invention to try to save the day, a deadly saboteur who wreaks havoc, several fatal crashes, a self-serving and arrogant naval commander, a &quot;tsunami&quot;-like wave that costs several lives, and much, much more!  The book is far too busy with plot; fewer and more developed characters would have been welcome.  The book, at over three hundred pages, is a bit long.  It is not enough that &quot;Meltdown&quot; has a valuable message or that it has scientific authenticity.  A novel must entertain, or it is not achieving its mission.	2000-12-24

Mate is an assisted-suicide doc who specializes in hastenening people to their final journey.  Wo killed and mutilated Mate?  The list of suspects mounts throughout the book.  Is the murderer a relative of one of Dr. Death's victims?  Or the murdererer the son of the deceased, angry at Dad for rejecting him?  To make things more complicated, Sturgis and Delaware find out that there is another Dr. Death around.  This person also has an M. D.; he is a man who enjoys killing people even though they are not necessarily ready to die.  There is a possiblity that this other Dr. Death knew Eldon Mate.  What was their relationship?  The problem with this novel is that it is overstuffed with too many characters and too many plot lines.  Delaware floats through the book interviewing suspects, trying to put two and two together, and the ending turns out to be more than a little bizarre.  Too bad, because some of the characters are interesting and well-drawn.  Others are just cardboard cut-outs, thrown into the mix to thicken the plot.  &quot;Dr. Death&quot; is so-so as a suspense novel.  It starts out better than it ends.	2000-12-18

Reacher is a footloose drifter who has spent most of his life in the army and after leaving the army, he has been living from hand to mouth, taking odd jobs in order to survive.  Reacher is a sensitive yet tough individual who has little use for material possessions.  He is loyal and answers only to his own conscience.  In this novel, Reacher hooks up with Jodie Garber Jacobs, a woman from his past.  Together, they investigate a troubling case that had obsessed Jodie's late father, Leon, a man whom Reacher had loved and admired greatly.  This case takes Jodie and Reacher across the country, and they unearth a secret that has cost many lives and that threatens to cost them their lives, as well.  &quot;Tripwire&quot; is suspenseful and violent.  The villain is a vicious, malevolent and thoroughly selfish individual.  However, &quot;Tripwire&quot; suffers from some lapses in logic.  The most illogical plot point is: &quot;Why didn't the villain change his identity more thoroughly to avoid having to confront his past?&quot;  The reader must suspend his disbelief while reading this book.  However, as a thriller, &quot;Tripwire&quot; delivers, with the &quot;take-no-prisoners&quot; and edge-of-the-seat excitement that are hallmarks of Child's writing style.  This book is at times macho, at times romantic, but always exciting.	2000-12-10

Deborah Crombie's work is not up to the level of Ruth Rendell's or Elizabeth George's, but she is a talented writer in the British tradition of police procedurals.  In Crombie's novel, &quot;Leave the Grave Green,&quot; Inspector Duncan Kincaid and Sergeant Gemma James investigate the murder of a young man named Connor Swann, who drowned under mysterious circumstances.  Both Kincaid and James are divorced and afraid of relationships, and Crombie explores the tentative nature of their mutual attraction very nicely.  The murder investigation is engrossing; it plays out interestingly and realistically.  Crombie depicts her characters with a sharp understanding of human nature and, in her own quiet way, she delivers a murder mystery that satisfies.  I love Inspector Kincaid and Sergeant James.  They are marvelous characters who are vulnerable working people struggling to make a place for themselves both professionally and personally.  I am looking forward to more books featuring Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James.	2000-12-07

Pat Frank's &quot;Alas Babylon&quot; was published in 1959, yet the writing is still fresh and original.  Frank depicts a small river town in central Florida, named Fort Repose, most of whose inhabitants escape the most devastating results of a widespread nuclear holocaust.  In the aftermath of the tragedy, the townspeople must cope with such serious problems as a lack of electricity, food shortages, lack of medical supplies and ravaging &quot;highwaymen&quot;.  Frank wisely focuses on the individual personalities in Fort Repose and we get to know them intimately.  The main character is Randy Bragg, an attorney who has no direction in life, until he pulls himself together to become a leader in his town when leadership is desperately needed.  Dan Gunn is an old-fashioned doctor who makes the best of a tragic situation.  He remains committed to helping as many people as he can, even when his medical supplies run out.  There are many other townspeople who appear in the book, and each has a role to play in the story.  Frank depicts the characters skillfully and with compassion, and they becomes flesh and blood people before our eyes.  Considering the depressing topic of the book, Frank uses humor liberally and effectively.  The story is riveting and the writing is sharp and believable.  Frank's book reinforces the idea that we sometimes lose sight of what really matters in life--until a tragedy forces us to reexamine our values.	2000-12-02

Stephen King's &quot;On Writing&quot; is part memoir and part advice to the budding writer.  At just under three hundred pages, &quot;On Writing&quot; is more concise than most of King's books.  King provides the reader with details of his impoverished and itinerant childhood. King entertainingly describes some of the wacky pranks that he and his brother pulled when they were kids, and he describes his early love affair with horror stories and horror films. King gives us a good idea of how he developed into the person that he is today.  The section on the art of writing is entertaining and informative, although it breaks little new ground.  The most powerful part of the book by far is the postscript, &quot;On Living,&quot; in which King describes the harrowing accident in 1999 that almost cost him his life.  He was hit by a van while walking along the side of the road near his home in Maine.  King had to undergo a series of operations followed by a painful and grueling rehabilitation.  This section of the book is wrenching and intensely personal.  It is excellently written and to the point.  I recommend &quot;On Writing&quot; to all Stephen King fans as well as to aspiring writers seeking advice on how to improve their work.	2000-11-26

Louisa Mae Cardinal is a talented writer who, with her brother Oz and her sick mother, go to live in the Virginia mountains in the 1940's.  They live in a house with the matriarch of the family, Louisa's great-grandmother, who is in her eighties.  Their life is strictly no-frills.  They have no electricity and no plumbing facilities.  Money is scarce for this troubled family and their future looks bleak. A series of tragedies and challenges tests the mettle of these characters and the book's climax is a courtroom scene that will determine the future of the Cardinal family.  Although the writing is competent and the characters are engaging, the book did not hold my interest throughout.  I found the pace slow-moving and the ending was somewhat trite and predictable.  Baldacci's heart is in the right place and I applaud his efforts at writing a novel that is so different from the suspense genre that made him famous.  However, as a coming-of-age novel, this book is less successful than the novel it most resembles--Harper Lee's great coming-of-age story, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.	2000-11-26

This book takes place in the year 2023, in a world laid waste by pollution and racked by violent warfare all over the globe.  The protagonist, Dr. Gideon Wolfe, is a psychiatrist and an expert in history, who gets involved with a band of intellectual fanatatics led by the Tressalian siblings, Malcolm and Larissa.  Malcolm, Larissa and their cohorts have one important goal: to prove to the world that the Information Age has enabled both governments and corporations to dupe the average citizens into believing anything that they see in the news media or on the Internet.  The Tressalians and their colleagues decide to create a series of hoaxes and then to subsequently reveal the source of these hoaxes, in order to show how easy it is to manipulate information in the modern world.  Unfortunately, their schemes backfire big time, leading to tragedy.  The strengths of the book lie in the well thought out scenario of what a future world may look like:  depopulated oceans, filthy cities and nuclear devices for sale to the highest bidder.  The characters are lively, from the brilliant, but slightly mad Malcolm to the morally troubled Dr. Wolfe, who is not sure that he agrees with Malcolm's theories.  Carr provides suspense, action and romance, but he gives no easy answers to the problems that will plague our society in the future. The book's major weakness is the melodrama that seeps into the plot, which at times seem too contrived to be believable.  Nonetheless, &quot;Killing Time&quot; is a thought-provoking look at the possibly dark future of humanity if we continue along our present course.	2000-11-18

This is the first novel that I have read by Leslie Glass.  &quot;Tracking Time&quot; explores the lives of the rich and selfish.  Two teenagers named David and Brandy have parents from hell.  Their parents are too wealthy and self-absorbed to know what is going on in their kids' lives.  Brandy and David are twisted and bitter youngsters who embark on a campaign of violence and terror for the sake of a few thrills.  The protagonist, Detective April Woo, is investigating the disappearance of psychiatrist Maslow Atkins and she senses that Brandy and David are somehow involved.  There is little suspense here, since Glass lets us know up front who did what to whom.  April has little to do in the way of investigating.  The novel's best moments come from the analysis of the protagonists' lives.  We learn about April's tortured relationship with her mother, whom she calls (disrespectfully) &quot;Skinny Dragon,&quot; and with her good-looking lover, Mike Sanchez, who loves April but has a roving eye.  The most wicked and enjoyable writing is reserved for the parents in the book and the two teens, who are all spoiled and nasty people.  Glass is sarcastic and funny in the way that she dissects these warped individuals.  The novel is well-paced and the dialogue is crisp and often amusing.  &quot;Tracking Time&quot; is entertaining and I recommend it for fans of psychological suspense.	2000-11-12

Our heroine, Kay Scarpetta, was almost killed by Jean-Baptiste Chandonne, the &quot;werewolf&quot;/serial killer.  In the aftermath of this frightening and traumatic event, Scarpetta is depressed and angry that the police are turning her home upside down while they investigate what happened.  Kay is desperately trying to come to terms with her messed-up life; she is still in mourning for her lover, Benton.  Kay turns for solace to her niece, Lucy, and her friend, Anna, but there are no easy answers.  Kay is considering leaving her job, but she is uncertain what she should do with the rest of her life.  Unfortunately, this is pretty much the plot of most of the book.  Scarpetta wallows in misery while her friends attempt to comfort her.  The only other plot is the tying in of three strange murders with a tacked on explanation of what really happened to Benton back in Philadelphia.  None of this is remotely entertaining or believable.  I have been a fan of the Scarpetta books for years.  They have been uneven in quality for some time now, but this virtually plotless novel is an indication that the Kay Scarpetta books have run their course.	2000-11-05

Anyone who reads Michelle Joy Levine's &quot;I Wish I Were Thin, I Wish I Were Fat,&quot; will not find a book filled with recipes and diet tips.  Levine's approach is to give the reader the tools to work on his or her &quot;inner self&quot;.  Working on the &quot;outer self&quot; comes later.  Are you interested in the dynamics of what makes you overeat in the first place?  Do you believe that psychological reasons underlie your desire to remain obese?  Some people believe that obesity is purely genetic and has no psychological component.  I am open to the idea that it is possible to have an unconscious wish to remain obese because of unresolved psychological problems.  Levine's book is well-written and clear.  She describes various scenarios in the form of mini-case studies to show how people sabotage their weight-loss efforts as a result of emotional conflicts dating from childhood.  For instance, a person who never separated emotionally from his mother may crave the nurturing that he misses now that he is an adult.  Food often equals nurturing to our subconscious minds.  Sometimes, a woman who fears getting close to a man may remain obese to avoid intimacy.  Obviously, no one can be sure that by reading this book, he or she will be able to lose weight. However, I think that Levine offers &quot;food for thought&quot; that may be helpful for those who want to get in closer touch with their &quot;inner selves&quot;.	2000-10-29

Any new book featuring one of my favorite detectives, Alan Banks, is always welcome.  In &quot;Cold is the Grave,&quot; Peter Robinson continues the saga of the brilliant but troubled Banks.  Jimmy Riddle, Banks' superior and arch-enemy, reluctantly asks Banks for help in bringing back Riddle's runaway daughter, sixteen-year-old Emily.  Banks accommodates Riddle, and he gets embroiled in a very difficult and depressing case.  While working on this case, Banks has to cope with the fallout from his rocky marriage to Sandra, his estranged wife.  In addition, Banks has to work again with Annie Cabbot, his former girlfriend, with whom he has a strained relationship.  The dialogue and the characterizations in this book are as sharp as ever.  Unfortunately, &quot;Cold is the Grave&quot; really collapses at the end.  Robinson makes the huge mistake of introducing, late in the book, some very unlikely and melodramatic plot points.  The ending is extremely hackneyed and unsatisfying.  What a shame, since Robinson is capable of terrific writing. His last book, &quot;In a Dry Season,&quot; was a masterpiece of detective fiction.  I hope that Robinson gets back to top form in his next novel.	2000-10-23

Having loved Robinson's splendid novel, &quot;In a Dry Season,&quot; I have become a big fan of this talented author.  Even though &quot;Blood at the Root&quot; is not a top notch mystery, it still features the charismatic Inspector Alan Banks.  Banks is a music-loving detective with marital problems and a penchant for drinking when he gets depressed.  He is also having problems with his supervisor, who absolutely loathes him. In short, Banks is a flawed individual, but when he gets on the scent of the suspect, he is persistent in tracking down any criminal unlucky enough to be in his sights.  Unfortunately, this time around, Banks is mired in a dull mystery.  The plot revolves around neo-Nazi types who are trying to foster racial hatred in their community.  One of their members is found brutally murdered, and the main suspects are Pakistani youths who had an argument with the victim before he was killed.  The victim, as well as the other people who figure in this mystery, are not particularly compelling.  However, I am still impressed with Robinson's sharp dialogue and his ability to delineate characters, and I will continue to read his work.	2000-10-17

Been there, done that. Yet, in spite of this, Goldberg manages to keep the reader's interest throughout.  How?  He writes crisp, no-nonsense dialogue.

Dodie Smith's &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; is the story of the Mortmain family, as told through the diary entries of seventeen-year old Cassandra Mortmain.  The Mortmains live in England in a drafty old castle, without any source of regular income.  In her witty and wonderfully colorful diary entries, Cassandra bemoans the horrible meals, the awful clothes and the bitter cold that they all must endure.  She writes with bravado and style, and she is a most endearing heroine.  Her family is not ordinary.  James Mortmain, her father, is a formerly successful author who wrote one book and then abruptly stopped writing. In spite of his family's extreme poverty, he refuses to put pen to paper.  Cassandra's stepmother, Topaz, is a former artist's model who is still gorgeous and occasionally outrageous.  Cassandra and Rose decide that Rose, the older sister, must marry someone wealthy in order to escape their wretched impoverished state.  Fortunately, two brothers, Simon and Neil Cotton, come into their lives and the inevitable romantic entanglements ensue.  Most of the book is engrossing and funny.  However, the book is a little too long.  The last fifty to seventy-five pages drag a bit.  All in all,  Smith has created a delightful heroine, whose fresh and irreverent voice is a breath of fresh air.  I recommend this book as a light and entertaining diversion.	2000-10-08

Marlene is back in the courtroom and Lucy is learning how to deal with the agony of being spiritual in an imperfect world.  Unfortunately, some of the plotting is contrived and unbelievable, especially at the end.  In spite of this flaw, Tanenbaum's knowledge of the law and his talent for creating memorable characters make &quot;True Justice&quot; an engrossing and entertaining novel.	2000-09-26

Detective Inspector Lynley and Detective  Sergeant Barbara Havers investigate the brutal torture and murder of a  young British boarding school student named Matthew Whately.  As in so many  police procedurals by such skilled authors such as Ruth Rendell, George  explores the hypocrisy and brutality that underlie the British veneer of  politeness.  With believable dialogue and careful plotting, George  explores such social problems  as class snobbery, abuse by older students against younger students, and the friction between parents and children.  George also gives  glimpses into the private lives and psyches of Havers, Lynley, Simon St. James, and his wife, Deborah, all of whom are trying to cope with serious personal problems.  With compassion and insight, George's novel reveals that when people are grossly dishonest with themselves and others, they may destroy not only their relationships but one another's lives, as well.  I  recommend \\"Well-Schooled in Murder\\" for fans of thought-provoking British murder mysteries.	2000-09-17

Having recently read, &quot;Lost on Everest,&quot; an account of the  deaths of George Mallory and his companion while climbing Mt. Everest, I  decided to read &quot;Into Thin Air,&quot; as well.  Krakauer writes  compellingly of the various expeditions that attempted to scale Everest in  the spring of 1996.  More people died that spring while trying to reach the  summit than in any previous season.  Ironically, some of the people who  perished, such as Rob Hall and Scott Fischer, were experienced mountaineers  and guides, not foolish and inexperienced dilettantes.  Krakauer does what  all good journalists do.  He sets the scene and brings the story to life  for the reader.  Krakauer makes clear that the desire to climb Everest is a  kind of mania, a compulsion that distorts people's judgement and sometimes  makes them act irrationally.  Climbing Everest is inherently dangerous,  even for experienced climbers.  The air is extremely thin at high altitudes  and the human body does not function well at that height.  In addition, the  weather is so treacherous that it is impossible to be completely prepared  for the bitter cold and scorching heat that a climber often encounters.  As  occurred in May of 1996, sudden storms can appear with horrible ferocity.  The footing is uncertain, and one false move can send a climber to his  death.  What makes this masochistic exercise even harder to understand is  the tremendous financial cost of climbing Everest--appoximately $65-70,000  for a guided tour up the mountain.  Krakauer's account is eloquent,  ruthlessly honest and fascinating.  He describes the horrifying climax to a  doomed expedition with great clarity and in heartbreaking detail.	2000-09-10

I have been a fan of Elizabeth George's Inspector Lynley novels for years.  When I picked up this book, I was expecting her usual excellent plotting  and character development.  I was particularly interested in why  &quot;Tommy&quot; Lynley is a person who has trouble with relationships,  especially with women.  Although this question and others are answered in  &quot;A Suitable Vengeance,&quot; unfortunately the book is something of a  potboiler.  It is tediously plotted and the story is melodramatic and  uninvolving.  Although George tends to write long novels, in the case of  &quot;A Suitable Vengeance&quot; the novel ran out of steam well before the  last page.  I lost interest somewhere in the middle and plodded on to the  end.  George's recent books are quite a bit better than this one, I am  happy to say.	2000-09-05

I enjoyed &quot;The Ladies' Man,&quot; Lipman's zany book about a man for whom flirting is as natural as breathing.  She has the same kooky and  irreverent tone at the beginning of &quot;The Inn at Lake Devine,&quot; a  novel about a Jewish girl named Natalie Marx.  The book opens during the  sixties. Natalie becomes fascinated with the inn of the title, mostly  because the owner is openly hostile to Jews.  Natalie cannot understand  this blatant anti-Semitism and she takes it personally.  As the plot  unfolds, Natalie becomes embroiled with the Berry family, who own the  &quot;Inn at Lake Devine&quot;.  Althought the book starts out promisingly,  with a mixture of Jewish shtick and outlandish characters, Lipman fails to  keep up the same tone throughout the book.  During the last half of the  book, the book's plot becomes too convoluted and labored and the characters  lose some of their sparkle.  This is unfortunate, since Lipman is one of  the most original comic writers around and her wit is often sharp and  deliciously wicked.	2000-09-03

Jodi Picoult's &quot;The Pact&quot; is reminiscent of Rosellen Brown's  novel &quot;Before and After&quot;.  In both books, the authors portray  happy families before and after tragedy strikes.  In &quot;The Pact,&quot;  Chris and Emily are two teenagers who have been best friends for many years  and they are inseparable.  When tragedy strikes, the lives of Chris and  Emily, as well as those of their families, are irrevocably changed.  Picoult starts the book well.  We get a sense of how the two families (the  Golds and the Hartes) interact, and we see in flashback how Chris and Emily  grew up together.  However, the book falters when Picoult discusses the  tragedy that is the centerpiece of the book.  Without being too specific  (for the sake of not giving away any secrets), there are some important  plot points converning Chris's behavior that weaken the book's  believability.  Chris and Emily's characters should have been developed  with more care.  In addition, the book has too many melodramatic touches.  &quot;The Pact&quot; lacked dramatic resonance for me, and I found it too  contrived to be truly involving.	2000-08-29

Peter Robinson's &quot;In a Dry Season&quot; is a splendid novel.  Although this book is a mystery, Robinson does much more than write an  entertaining whodunit.  He does what the top-notch British mystery writers  do.  He develops his characters, settings and time periods precisely, and  he shows an understanding of what makes people act in a certain way.  &quot;In a Dry Season&quot; features Alan Banks, a Detective Chief  Inspector restricted to desk duty after a falling out with his superior.  Banks is separated from his wife of twenty years, and he is having  difficulty with his rebellious son.  Suddenly, a new case is thrown into  his lap.  Banks is asked to solve the mystery of a long-buried skeleton  that is unearthed by accident in a dried-up reservoir.  Who was this person  whose bones lay buried for more than fifty years?  Why was he/she killed?  Banks discovers that this case stirs his interest and curiosity and he is  back in the hunt, eager to flex his mind and his excellent instincts.  Like  so many other sleuths in British detective novels, Banks is a flawed  individual but a superb detective.  As the novel unfolds, partly in  flashback, the reader is drawn into the life of the murder victim as well  as into the life of Banks, for whom this new case is a chance to vindicate  himself.  As a detective story, &quot;In a Dry Season&quot; is riveting,  and I recommend it highly.  It is in the tradition of the best novels of  Ruth Rendell, P. D. James and Elizabeth George.	2000-08-27

Lee Child's &quot;Running Blind&quot; is a novel about the FBI's efforts to find a sadistic and malevolent serial killer.  The main character is  Jack Reacher, a macho ex-military man, who is as sharp mentally as he is  quick and capable with his fists. Reacher lives by a unique moral code and  pretty much does as he likes.  He has no job, has little respect for  authority and doesn't play by society's rules.  The FBI enlists Reacher's  help when their best investigators are stymied by the aforementioned killer  who is murdering women without leaving any obvious clues.  Reacher is a  brilliant investigator who thinks creatively and makes mental leaps that  are helpful in solving difficult cases.  &quot;Running Blind&quot; is  fast-paced and action-packed, and Reacher is an appealing, if rough-edged,  hero.  Child would have us believe that Reacher owns one set of clothes and  wears them all the time!  That is a bit much to swallow.  Another quibble  that I have is that Child uses too much misdirection to fool the reader and  I feel that he sometimes does not play fair.  However, &quot;Running  Blind&quot; does have sharp dialogue and many unexpected twists and turns.  It is a page-turner and I doubt that anyone will be able to put it down in  the last ten pages.  I recommend &quot;Running Blind,&quot; since it is a  clever police procedural that keeps the reader guessing until the end.	2000-08-20

Deborah Crombie writes uncannily like another American-born author of  English detective novels, Elizabeth George.  Both Crombie and George write  about British detectives who are intensely human, compassionate and  introspective.  At the same time, these detectives are very competent and  persistent in their dogged pursuit of justice.  Crombie and George also go  to great pains to develop their characters, and they write natural dialogue  that is both literate and engaging.  In &quot;Dreaming of the Bones,&quot;  Crombie explores the deepening relationship between Duncan Kincaid and  Gemma James.  The personal lives of these two characters are in turmoil,  and suddenly, Kincaid and James find themselves joining forces to solve a  serious of murders that hit uncomfortably close to home.  In &quot;Dreaming  of the Bones,&quot; Crombie uses flashbacks skillfully and her sardonic  humor is delightful.  The only drawback is the ending, which is a little  anticlimactic and drags on longer than it should.  In spite of this flaw, I  recommend &quot;Dreaming of the Bones&quot; highly, since it is a  satisfying and an entertaining mystery.	2000-08-18

Noah Gordon's &quot;The Last Jew&quot; describes the wrenching experience of the Jewish communities in Spain and Portugal who suffered horribly  during the infamous Inquisition. As the book opens in 1489, the Toledano  family, famous for its expertise in metalworking, is central to the story.  Meir, one of the Toledano sons, is found dead in the process of delivering  a sacred silver and gold object to a priest, and his death leads to an  investigation which has far ranging implications for Jews and Catholics  alike.  Subsequently, Yonah Toledano, Meir's brother, suffers through the  death and expulsion of his fellow Jews as the Inquisition heats up.  He  decides not to flee Spain, nor does he undergo a false conversion to  Catholicism as so many others do. He travels the country pretending to be  an &quot;Old Christian&quot; and he silently mouths the Jewish prayers that  he remembers from his youth.  &quot;The Lost Jew&quot; is a &quot;road  story&quot; as Yonah wanders from place to place, taking up migrant labor,  work in an armory and medicine. He befriends a number of people, including  women, as he tries to find a purpose in life. At the back of his mind, he  wants to take revenge on those who killed his brother.  Unfortunately, the  novel loses its way for several reasons. Yonah's character remains a  cipher.  He seems to care about Judaism occasionally, but most of the time  he scarcely gives it a thought. He seems a little too nimble with  everything that comes his way. He is equally adept at forging steel and  performing surgery!  The book does not have a strong central theme that  carries it along. It meanders along slowly with Yonah as he travels from  place to place, and the large cast of characters tends to become confusing  after a while.  It is also too coincidental that Yonah keeps meeting up  with people that he knew as a youth. Too many coincidences weaken a book.  I am very interesting in this tragic period of Jewish history, but, for all  of his meticulous research, Gordon did not put together a particularly  compelling story.his meticulous research, Gordon did not put together a particularly  compelling story.	2000-08-13

Mark Rosen, in his wonderfully titled book, &quot;Thank You for Being Such  a Pain,&quot; has an interesting point of view. He believes that dealing  with the difficult people in our lives (and we all have them) can help us  grow spiritually and emotionally.  If we step back from a troubling  situation and try to be objective about difficult people, whether they are  our bosses, our relatives, our friends, or our neighbors, we can deal with  them more effectively.  Rosen goes further.  He feels that there is a  reason that difficult people come into our lives. They are there to teach  us such important lessons as how NOT to treat other people.  In addition,  as we deal with people who are &quot;pains in the neck,&quot; we can learn  empathy and we can improve our communication skills.  It sounds good, but  does it work? I admit that I have to deal with some difficult people and I  tried to use some of Dr. Rosen's advice.  Sometimes it worked and sometimes  it didn't.  However, his words do come back to me during the course of the  day, and I think that his message is worthwhile.  You have nothing to lose  and everything to gain from trying a new approach with those people who  make your life miserable.  Dr. Rosen's sense of humor and commonsense  approach are refreshing and I recommend this book highly.	2000-08-11

In &quot;Chain of Custody,&quot; Harold Levy describes the plight of Michael Malone, a cardiologist turned high-powered lawyer. Malone is  accused of murder and the evidence against him is convincing.  Although  this is a common plot in legal thrillers, Levy does a good job of raising  this novel a few notches above the ordinary. Levy's breezy dialogue moves  along nicely and his characters are engrossing. The courtroom scenes are  convincingly written.  Although the story gets complicated at the end, and  some coincidences seem a bit far-fetched, the ending did take me by  surprise and that is a rarity.  Levy's writing is understated and at times  humorous, and he knows how to build up suspense without being heavy-handed.  Fans of legal thrillers should enjoy &quot;Chain of Custody&quot;.  I look  forward to further work by this author.	2000-08-06

Firstbrook, in his ambitious book, depicts man's many attempts to  climb Mr. Everest, as well as the tragic deaths of so many climbers.  &quot;Lost on Everest&quot; leaves me with a gnawing question. Were the  climbers who scaled this forbidding mountain back in the twenties brave or  foolhardy or both?  Even with the more advanced equipment and clothing that  is available nowadays, many people who are experienced climbers still die  while trying to reach the summit. The weather on Everest is so changeable  and fierce, and the footing is so treacherous, that there is a huge element  of danger in making this frightening climb.  Firstbrook brings this story  to life by focusing on George Mallory, a young man who died on Everest in  1924 after a number of unsuccessful attempts to conquer the mountain.  Mallory was experienced, skilled and fearless, but he also had a tendency  to be reckless, careless and absentminded. Did Mallory reach the summit  before his death?  Did Mallory make a fatal mistake that cost him his life  and that of his companion, Andrew Irvine?  We will never be sure of the  answers to these questions. In 1999, an expedition was sent to find  Mallory's body, and sure enough, his body was found on the mountain after  having lain there for seventy-five years.  I found the story of Mallory's  adventures and those of his fellow climbers riveting, but I was also  saddened by the loss of life brought on by man's obsession with conquering  the highest mountain on earth.	2000-08-06

James McBride, in &quot;The Color of Water,&quot; writes about his Jewish mother and the tremendous impact that she had on him and on his siblings.  Rachel Shilsky was born in Poland and she emigrated with her family to  America when she was a young girl. Rachel's father abused her emotionally  and physically, and her life consisted of poverty, loneliness and drudgery.  When she could stand it no longer, Rachel changed her name to Ruth and she  left her father, mother and sister to start a new life. Ruth cut herself  off from her entire heritage and embraced Christianity. She was also  married twice (to Black men) and she had twelve children.  McBride does not  wallow in sentiment, and his book is all the more touching because of its  humor and realism.  He describes his family life, warts and all.  McBride  admits that, as a young man, he robbed people and experimented with drugs.  Gradually, McBride found his path in life, and he also learned the  surprising history of his mother's life, which she had taken great pains to  hide.  McBride's voyage of self-discovery parallels his discovery of how  Rachel Shilsky became Ruth McBride Jordan, church founder and mother of  twelve mixed-race children.  &quot;The Color of Water&quot; is beautifully  written, understated, and eloquent.  You will not easily forget it.	2000-08-04

Yalom, a therapist who has written a number of non-fiction books on psychotherapy.  This work of fiction peers into the lives of various psychoanalysts and the  people whom they analyze.  The two main characters are Marshal Streider, a  pompous psycholanalyst who is driven by a desperate hunger for fame, wealth  and social position, and Ernest Lash, who is Marshall's student. Lash tries  a novel approach in psychotherapy. He tries experimenting with an  &quot;honest&quot; approach towards his patients. Yalom has fun dissecting  the lives of Streider, Lash and their patients. The title, &quot;Lying on  the Couch,&quot; is a play on words. Yalom tells us that we often lie to  our analysts and to ourselves, because lying appears to be easier than  facing up to the truth about ourselves.  He also probes some of the  unconscious feelings that drive some people's self-destructive behavior.  In addition, Yalom hilariously punctures the pomposity of jargon-spewing  analysts who never use a one-syllable word if they can help it.  Ultimately, Dr. Yalom poignantly shows that being true to ourselves and  working through our childhood issues is a necessary step towards ultimate  growth and fulfillment.  This book is creative, literate, and often very  funny.  &quot;Lying on the Couch&quot; is a delightful entertainment for  the thinking reader who is fascinated by the life of the mind.	2000-07-30

A lovely sixteen-year-old named Griet, whose family has suffered financial setbacks, is sent to be a  maidservant in the home of the great Dutch painter, Johannes Vermeer.  Griet finds herself drawn to the world of Vermeer--a world of light, color,  beauty and perfect composition.  Griet shows an aptitude for understanding  art and she gradually begins to assist Vermeer in his painting.  Griet's  involvement in Vermeer's art sets the stage for family conflict. (The title  of the novel comes from a Vermeer painting that is known as the Dutch Mona  Lisa because of the enigmatic young woman in the portrait.)  This novel is  a small gem and it is an immensely satisfying work of fiction.  Chevalier  perfectly captures the life of 17th Century Delft, with its sharp religious  and class distinctions, and her nuanced dialogue and descriptive passages  are beautifully textured. In fact, &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is  like a Vermeer portrait. It is expressive, subtle and meaningful. I highly  recommend this book for people who are fascinated by art and who enjoy  historical fiction.	2000-07-23

Junger is a journalist  who goes into a detailed description of one of the worst storms ever to hit  the Northeastern United States.  He describes the meterological phenomena  that came together to form the storm, and he attempts to reconstruct the  fate of the fishermen and other sailors who were at sea when the storm hit  with the force of a juggernaut. Junger discusses the physics of ocean waves  and of various types of boats.  He also describes the incredibly courageous  search and rescue teams who risked their lives to pluck people from the  ocean.  This is not a pretty or an elegant book; it is not pleasant to read  about people who die horrible deaths.  However, &quot;The Perfect  Storm&quot; is powerful and unforgettable.  It reinforces the idea that no  matter how technologically advanced human beings become, we are often  powerless against the forces of nature.  Reading this book is a humbling  and a fascinating experience.	2000-07-09

The book seemed to be a tongue-in-cheek  look at the life of a modern woman.  Unfortunately, Bank chooses to jumble  up the plot lines and characters in the different chapters of the book.  This is confusing and it left me without a coherent feel for what Bank is  trying to say.  The narrator, Jane Rosenal, is not even present in one  chapter, which is narrated by another woman named Nina.  The love affairs  recounted in the book are, for the most part, uninteresting and without  real insight. There are occasional doses of wit and humor that brighten up  the book.  However, &quot;The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing&quot;  doesn't add up to very much.	2000-07-09

Judith Henry Wall's novel, &quot;My Mother's Daughter,&quot; is the poignant story of two sisters, Justine and Martha Claire Mayfield, who live in a small Texas town.  After Justine goes off to serve in World War II,  she comes back a changed woman, and the entire Mayfield family undergoes a  series of shocks which alter their lives forever.  The book is a little  melodramatic at times, and it has some unfortunate soap opera elements.  However, Wall's book has strong redeeming features.  She describes the  Texas town of Columbus lovingly and in great detail.  Wall has a deft touch  with dialogue and the narrative flows smoothly throughout the book, as the  author describes the joys and the tragedies in the lives of the sisters and  their loved ones.  I was drawn into the story of Justine, Marie Claire and  their children, and I found Wall's old-fashioned storytelling effective and  moving.  She shows how fallible human beings make serious mistakes and  hurt themselves and the people whom they love the most.  Above all, this  book shows how the nuclear family is the most bloody battleground of all.  The family can be a source of great happiness or of great pain.  Wall makes  the reader care about her characters and sympathize with their anguish. I  recommend this book to readers who enjoy generational stories.	2000-07-02

Elinor Lipman's &quot;The Ladies' Man&quot; is so funny and yet so true to human nature that it is doubly pleasurable.  It is the story of Harvey Nash or Nash Harvey (he likes to change the order of his name), a man so  addicted to flirting that it is almost a reflex action.  He leaves a trail  of broken hearts wherever he goes.  Nash has a romantic history with Adele  Dobbin, who now works as an on-air fundraiser for a public television  station in Boston. Adele has a bunch of hilarious siblings who have an  unbreakable habit of interfering with one another's lives.  Throughout most  of the book, Lipman shows Nash and the Dobbin siblings stumbling through  different entanglements, romantic and otherwise, as they try to make some  sense out of their lives.  At times poignant, at other times sardonic and  satirical, &quot;The Ladies' Man&quot; is a delicious comedy of manners for  the modern reader.	2000-06-25

The author slowly weaves a rich tapestry of colorful  characters who inhabit this island, from the giant who can perform  unbelievable feats of weightlifting to a priest who gets drunk at every  opportunity.  The tranquil life of these islanders is shattered by the  onset of World War II, when the Italians and the Germans invade the island.  De Bernieres intersperses moments of high comedy with scenes of great  tragedy and violence.  This is an anti-war novel as well as a story of  love, betrayal and self-sacrifice. It is also a celebration of survival and  of the richness of life.  &quot;Corelli's Mandolin&quot; is not an easy  book to read, since the author flits from one character to another and from  one plot line to another very frequently.  However, at the end, everything  comes together satisfyingly.  The novel is poignant and, at times,  heartbraking.  Overall, the journey to Cephallonia is well worth taking,  and I recommend &quot;Corelli's Mandolin&quot; as a fine work of historical  fiction.	2000-06-11

Lelia Kelly's &quot;Presumption of Guilt&quot; is a fine legal thriller/police prodecural.  Her protagonist is Laura Chastain, a corporate lawyer with a talent for criminal defense work.  After getting a  high-profile client off the hook, Laura takes on the case of a cop who is  accused of killing a suspect. Laura gradually finds out that she has taken  on a case that is extremely complex and potentially dangerous. She also  becomes romantically involved with an older man with whom she falls deeply  in love.  Kelly writes dialogue that is funny and sharp.  Her plot is  fairly tight and engrossing until the end, which is a little too  complicated and has one too many coincidences.  Having read this book, and  the next in the series, &quot;False Witness,&quot; I recommend Lelia  Kelly's novels to fans of this genre.	2000-06-08

She knows her strengths and she sticks to the type of writing that she does well.  Clark's latest novel, &quot;Before I Say Goodbye,&quot; is the story of Nell MacDermott, a  newspaper columnist who wants to run for her grandfather's former  Congressional seat.  She has been married for three years to Adam Cauliff.  Adam is an architect who has been acting secretively of late.  He is  vehemently opposed to Nell's idea of running for office, and this is a  source of friction in their marriage.  Suddenly, a terrible accident occurs  on Adam's cabin cruiser, and Nell's entire world is turned upside down.  The man whom she loved is suddenly a stranger to her, and Nell must come to  terms with some harsh truths about her husband's secret life.  Clark's plot  is intricate, with many characters woven in to the narrative.  One problem  with the book is the large number of coincidences that tie all the  characters and plot elements together.  Too many unbelievable things happen  to bring the story to a &quot;logical&quot; conclusion.  To her credit,  Clark avoids writing gloppy romantic scenes, and she limits the melodrama  to the very end of the novel.  &quot;Before I Say Goodbye&quot; is good  escapist fiction, a genre at which Mary Higgins Clark excels.	2000-05-14

Michael Palmer has written some very good medical thrillers, including &quot;The Sisterhood&quot; and &quot;Natural Causes&quot;.  In his latest novel, the star is ARTIE, which stands for Assisted Robotic Tissue Incision  and Extraction. Dr. Jessie Copeland is a brilliant engineer and  neurosurgeon who is using ARTIE, a robot, to excise brian tumors without  destroying normal brain tissue.  The parts of the book in which the author  describes how ARTIE works are absolutely fascinating.  In an afterword,  Palmer tells his readers that ARTIE is not just a product of his  imagination, but a real possibility in the future of surgery. The main plot  of the novel deals with a vicious terrorist named Claude Malloche who has a  brain tumor and wants it removed expertly and completely.  Unfortunately,  he will kill anyone who gets in his way, including medical personnel.  Jessie gets involved with a rogue FBI agent named Alex Bishop, who has been  tracking Malloche unsuccessfully for five years.  The plot becomes a little  cliche-ridden by the end of the book (terrorists are used far too often in  thrillers these days), but Palmer keeps the suspense at a high level  throughout.  This is a better than average medical thriller and I recommend  it to fans of this genre.	2000-05-07

It is the fictionalized account of Grace Marks, a woman who was tried and convicted for the murder of her employer and a fellow servant in Canada during the 1800's.  Atwood depicts the life  of Grace Marks poignantly.  Grace is born into a very poor family and  tragically loses her mother at a young age during a horrible sea voyage  from Ireland to Canada.  After reaching Canada, Grace is hired out as a  domestic in various households.  Eventually, she winds up working in the  Kinnear household where the murders occur.  A large and fascinating portion  of the book is devoted to Grace's recollections as told to Simon Jordan, a  medical doctor who specializes in diseases of the mind.  &quot;Alias  Grace&quot; is populated with a large cast of Dickensian characters who are  vividly described.  The book is filled with delicious sardonic humor.  In  addition, &quot;Alias Grace&quot; is a social commentary, since Atwood  indicts the cruel treatment of the &quot;lower classes&quot; in the 1800's.  The detailed descriptions of Grace's endless duties as a servant while the  masters of the household live a life of indolence are particularly  powerful.  Atwood uses clever literary devices to add texture to the novel.  She quotes songs and other true life accounts of Grace's  &quot;crime,&quot; and there is even a drawing of Grace and her  &quot;accomplice&quot;.  Atwood shifts points of view, so that we get the  story from different angles.  Atwood's style of storytelling is so  engrossing that I was completely drawn into this world.  Don't miss this  excellent novel!	2000-04-30

Jesse Drake is back.  She is an LAPD detective who has previously appeared in several Krich novels.  This time, Jesse is investigating the kidnapping of Molly, the daughter of Dr. Renee (a radio  psychologist), and the murder of Molly's nanny. Renee Altman and Jesse  Drake used to be friends, but they drifted apart over the years. Now Jesse  is once again involved with Renne as she delves into her friend's troubled  life.  Not only is Renee in torment over Molly's diappearance, but she is  also upset about her separation from her husband, Barry, and the sinking  ratings of her radio show.  Jesse and her colleagues must find out who  kidnapped Molly and where the child is being held.  Could Barry, Renee's  estranged husband, have had something to do with the child's disappearance?  Or is the kidnapper someone with a grudge against Dr. Renee?  Krich  captures the atmosphere of &quot;radio psychology&quot; well, as Dr. Renee  lambastes her callers with scathing advice and withering criticism.  Dr.  Renee is a thinly veiled Dr. Laura, whom the author mentions in the book  several times.  Krich explores the theme of how effective and therapeutic  radio psychology can ever be. Do  radio psychologists serve a beneficial  purpose or is what they do shallow and harmful--&quot;microwave  psychology,&quot; as one character derisively labels it?  Krich explores  Renee's and Jesse's personal and professional problems nicely and the book  is exciting and entertaining.  &quot;Dead Air&quot; is a timely and  engrossing mystery.	2000-04-28

In &quot;Strange Fits of Passion,&quot; Shreve describes a woman in great distress. Maureen and Harrold both write for a magazine in New York in the 1970's.  They fall in love and marry.  Maureen learns too late that Harrold  becomes abusive and vicious, especially when he is drunk.  Unfortunately,  Harrold is often drunk.  During her pregnancy and after she gives birth,  Harrold's abuse intensifies.  Maureen hides the fact that Harrold is  physically and emotionally abusive from her family and friends.

Finally,  after a particularly brutal incident, Maureen packs up her baby, Caroline,  and winds up in a small town in Maine named St. Hilaire; she hopes to  escape her huband's wrath and protect her baby.  Shreve captures the  ambiance of the rugged town and its colorful inhabitants beautifully.  Shreve populates &quot;Strange Fits of Passion&quot; with interesting and  memorable characters, including Jack Strout, a lobsterman with whom Maureen  falls in love.  The author uses clever literary devices to tell this moving  story, and I could not put this book down until I found out what happens to  Maureen.  &quot;Strange Fits of Passion&quot; is a powerful and and  emotionally involving novel that explores the complexities of human  relationships.	2000-04-23

Claire is desperately looking for a purpose and a future for herself.  She  makes the acquaintance of Martin Gibson, a patron of the bookstore where  she works.  Claire views Martin as a weak man who needs her guidance.  She  is misguided in this, as she is in most of the projects that she  undertakes.  &quot;Undue Influence&quot; is a slice of life about a woman  who has few ambitions and is at loose ends.  Brookner uses wit and a deft  touch to describe Claire. What Claire must learn to do is live in the here  and now and face reality.  Only then will she have a future. Although the  book has it charms, I began to lose patience with Claire's flighty behavior  towards the end of the novel.  However, the book is effective in its  depiction of a lost soul.	2000-04-23

Kate is a sympathetic and smart character and we root for her to get to the bottom of Joel's disappearance without coming to any harm herself.  Unfortunately, the books goes badly off track at the halfway point. Kate becomes Nancy Drew as she runs around interrogating anyone who might shed light on what her husband has been up to.

The author, Leila Kelly, describes the unfolding  murder investigation in fascinating detail and her courtroom scenes are  excellent.  The case turns out to have a number of twists and turns, and I  had no idea how it would end.  The books has a satisfying resolution that  is clever and devoid of the cheap pyrotechnics and violence so popular  these days. Kelly has a good ear for dialogue and &quot;False Witness&quot;  is fast-paced.  I recommend this book for fans of legal suspense.	2000-04-23

I picked up &quot;Daughter of Fortune,&quot; by Isabel Allende, because it is an Oprah book and I have liked some of Oprah's choices.  I was drawn to the story of Eliza, a foundling taken in by a British brother and sister,  Jeremy and Rose Sommers, in Valparaiso, Chile. Allende describes Eliza's  childhood in Chile effectively.  Rose Sommers, who has never married, cares  for Eliza but does not know how to nurture her effectively.  Jeremy Sommers  is remote and busy with business matters.  Eliza learns a great deal at the  feet of Mama Fresia, a loving Indian woman who is as wise as she is caring.  The book takes a strange turn when Eliza falls in love and travels to  California during the Gold Rush to search for her departed lover.  The book  meanders badly after that, with new characters constantly being introduced.  Allende captures the frenzy and madness of the California Gold Rush, but  Eliza gets lost in the hubbub.  She meets a Chinese man, named Tao Chi'en,  on her voyage to America.  Tao Chi'en becomes a confidante and a close  friend, but this relationship is not satisfactorily developed.  Eliza also  gets involved with a madam running a brothel.  All these characters are  shallow and uninteresting.  The promise of the first part of the book is  not realized, as the book meanders to its disappointing conclusion.	2000-04-16

I have enjoyed some of Leonard Goldberg's medical thrillers in the past.  However, he has stumbled with &quot;Lethal Measures&quot;.  Joanna Blalock is back as the brilliant pathologist and Jake Sinclair is also present as  the crackerjack policeman who still holds a torch for Joanna.  This time  the subject is domestic terrorism, in the form of a small band of fanatics  who will kill anyone to get back at the federal government.  The characters  never come to life in this book and the amateurish dialogue is painful to  read. However, the author has done his research well and the details about  forensic anthropology, bombmaking and prosthetic devices are fascinating  and authentic.  Unfortunately, a romantic subplot is thrown in almost as an  afterthought.  The body count is high, and there are details about what a  bomb does to a human being that some might find distubring.  The book  needed sharper and more realistic dialogue and more originality in the  plotting.  As it stands, it is a run-of-the-mill thriller.	2000-04-09

Linda Fairstein knows her turf.  She has been a prosecutor of sexual crimes in New York City under the fabled Manhattan District Attorney, Bob Morgenthau, for many years.  Her expertise in police matters is evident in  this well-researched novel.  She explores the lifestyles of the rich and  famous in this story of socialite Deni Caxton, who is assaulted, murdered  and dumped in the Hudson River. Deni and her estranged husband, Lowell, are  wealthy art collectors. Alex Cooper is back with her friends, the  detectives Mercer Wallace and Mike Chapman.  They interview Deni's friends  and acquaintances as they explore the seamy world of art theft.  As  pleasant as it is to be in the company of Alex and her friends, the plot  wobbles badly at the end as the murderer's identity is finally revealed.  However, along the way, Fairstein again proves that she is thoroughly at  home with police procedurals and her characters are always fun to be with.  This is a light and pleasant read.	2000-04-02

When Mary DiNunzio, the lawyer and main character of \\"Moment of Truth,\\" visits the \\"Young and Hip\\" floor of a department store, she meets a young and hip salesgirl. She describes the salesgirl as \\"a skinny young woman with about three hundred plastic clips in her . . . short, canary-colored hair that looked greasy on purpose, [with] no discernible shame about her black roots, and a tongue pierce that created a speech impediment\\". Scottoline does not take herself or her characters very seriously and this is refreshing. Mary takes on the case of Jack Newlin, who falsely confesses to killing his wife, Honor, in order to protect his daughter, Paige. Mary's colleagues, Judy and Lou, provide her with support and with the same camaraderie that they have in previous Scottoline novels. Mary's old-fashioned Italian parents are as warm and as funny as usual and Mary is a smart, self-effacing and lovable character. The novel also features two cops, Brinkley and Kovich, who seem like real cops and are nicely fleshed out. Unfortunately, the plot is not as strong as the characters and the dialogue. It is a mishmash, especially the tacked on ending that makes little sense and is completely out of left field. Scottoline is using the \\"surprise ending\\" ploy which rarely works, and it doesn't work here. However, the plot is almost a side issue, since the characters and the humor carry the book along nicely. \\"Moment of Truth\\" is a fun read.	2000-03-26

Julie Parson's first book, &quot;Mary, Mary,&quot; was outstanding.  Her second novel, &quot;The Courtship Gift,&quot; is not as good as her first.  Parsons has a kinship with Ruth Rendell; she focuses on people who have  been abused as children and who then turn their anger outward to harm  others later in life. Michael Mullen had a mother who was a drunken  prostitute.  After her death, he was raised by his grandmother, and he  learned that you take what you want out of life, no matter whom you hurt.  Michael proceeds to become a big-time drug dealer and when he wants money  or a woman, he simply kills whoever gets in his way.  The heroine is Anna  Neale, whose husband is Michael's latest victim.  Her character is a  weakness in the book.  She is a brilliant entomologist (an expert on  insects), but she is unbelievably naive and gullible when it comes to men.  Anna has no idea that her husband, David, had a host of unsavory  &quot;extracurricular activities&quot; before his untimely demise. Michael  effortlessly draws Anna into his spider web, and it takes Anna a long time  to realize that Michael is not the nice guy that he appears to be on the  surface.  Anna's naivete is unbelievable, although it a convenient plot  device.  Michael is so completely evil that he becomes a caricature.  However, Parsons has a way with dialogue and suspense, and the book flows  smoothly until its violent end. &quot;The Courtship Gift&quot; is a dark  book about some very dysfunctional people.	2000-03-19

I have read a number of books by Morrell in the past because he has the ability to write extremely exciting action sequences.  Unfortunately, in &quot;Burnt Sienna,&quot; even the action sequences are not particularly  exciting. In fact, this book is weak in a number of ways.  The lead  character, Chase Malone, a Marine who becomes a world-famous painter, is a  macho man with a sensitive soul.  Sienna Bellasar, the  beautiful heroine,  is a somewhat clueless beauty who seems to be oblivious to the fact that  she is married to a psychopath.  Do beautiful women have to be so dumb?  Sienna's husband, Derek, is a &quot;by the numbers&quot; character.  He's  filthy rich from selling armaments to rogue regimes, and he will do  anything for money. Bellasar also discards women who pass the age of  thirty, because their beauty starts to fade. When I say  &quot;discards,&quot; I mean it literally--he has them killed.  Our hero,  Chase, is sent by the CIA to save Sienna and to stop Derek from his  nefarious activities.  None of these characters ever comes to life.  The  action sequences are not particularly exciting.  The only part of the book  that moved me was the last page, which was somewhat poignant.

Steve Martini made a mistake when he stopped writing legal thrillers. &quot;Critical Mass&quot; was poorly written and uninvolving.  Here, Paul Madriani is back as the attorney in the title.  He has been hired to find  the granddaughter of an elderly lottery winner named Jonah Hale.  It seems  that Jonah's daughter, Jessica, is a drug addict who ran with a fast crowd  and disappeared with her daughter, Amanda.  At the time of her  disappearance, Amanda was legally in her grandfather's custody.  Also  involved in the intrigue is Madriani's lover, Susan, who works on behalf of  abused children, and a Mexican drug lord, among others.  Before long, an  unpleasant woman named Zolanda Suade is murdered and Madriani's client is  on trial for Suade's murder.  Hale had threatened Zolanda, because he  thought that she had helped Jessica and Amanda to disappear without a  trace.  The courtroom scenes in which Madriani defends Hale are well done  (Martini has always been a master at depicting courtroom theatrics), but  the ending is unbelievable and full of holes.  A number of key questions  are left unanswered, which is a weakness in a mystery/thriller.  Martini  loves surprise endings, and I do, as well.  However, I also expect that  endings should make sense.  In this case, &quot;The Attorney&quot; fails  the test.  This is unfortunate, since Madriani is an engaging character and  the story held my interest until the shaky ending.	2000-03-12

Martini was wise to go back to his &quot;bread and butter&quot; protagonist, Paul Madriani.  I always enjoyed this character and I was dismayed at such books as Martini's &quot;Critical Mass,&quot; in which  Martini discarded both Madriani and the legal thriller genre. Much of  &quot;The Attorney&quot; is exciting and compelling. Paul Madriani, the  hero of the title, tries to help Jonah Hale, an older man who has made a  great deal of money in a lottery.  Hale's granddaughter is missing, along  with her drug-addicted mother.  Along the way, Madriani encounters  complications relating to his lover, Susan, who works with abused children,  and Paul is nearly killed by a Mexican drug lord.  Eventually, a key  characters is murdered and Paul is the defendant's attorney at trial.  As  always, Martini is very good at writing courtroom sequences.  As compelling  as some of these courtroom scenes are, the book drags on for over 400  pages.  The most problematic element of the book, however, is the tacked-on  ending.  Martini loves surprise endings.  He delivers the surprise at the  very end of the book and it simply does not hold water.  There are plot  holes at the end that are enormous and the author never plugs up the holes.  I still enjoyed much of the book, but Martini should be more careful in  making the plot more coherent.  Surprise endings work only when they make  sense.	2000-03-05

Tragically, five years before, the family  had lost a little girl named Meagan, who was murdered by a serial killer.  The members of the Stokes family start to receive threatening notes, in  which they are told, &quot;You get what you deserve.&quot; It seems that  the Stokes family is hiding a thing or two about their past.  To say that  the plot of this book is absurd is a gross understatement.  The characters  never come to life.  The dialogue is stilted.  The explanation at the end  for all the strange events that happen in the book is completely  preposterous.  No one expects a thriller to be absolutely realistic, but  there should be a semblance of believability in the plotting.  &quot;The  Other Daughter&quot; never comes to life.  Skip this one.	2000-02-27

At first, it is an absorbing story of a small island in Massachusetts, where there are no secrets.  The island is depicted lovingly as a place where  people can live out their lives in a beautiful setting.  As the narrative  proceeds, the lives of the various residents of Saltash Island become  intertwined.  The main characters are David, a former baseball player who  never lived up to his potential, and Judith, a married lawyer with whom  David becomes romantically involved.  Their relationship is threatened by  Crystal, a scheming woman with a son who moves in (literally) on David and  tries to take over his life.  Complicating matters still further, David  runs for political office on the island, which challenges the political  machine set up years ago by the island's boss, Johnny Lynch.  To their  credit, Piercy and Wood try to make the characters three-dimensional.  However, the authors throw too many complications into the story.  They try  to deal with the characters' ties to Judaism, their eroticism, their  political involvement, and their family ties all at once.  The plot becomes  much too convoluted.  By the end of the book, I was weary of all the  machinations invented by the authors.  Too much goes on at once to keep the  narrative flowing smoothly.  This is too bad, since the book began quite  well and seemed to be heading in an interesting direction.	2000-02-27

She is a trophy wife who has no real  connection to her husband.  She loves her children, but she is not  extremely involved with them.  Who is Edna?  What does she want?  She wants  to experience life to the fullest, without constraint.  She wants personal  freedom, without the need to conform to the social mores of her day.  However, she does not want to harm her children while seeking her own  personal fulfillment.  Edna's torment leads to a deep depression.  The  reason that this book has attracted so much attention is that it was  written a century ago, long before women had heard of  &quot;liberation&quot;.  Chopin's writing is eloquent and moving.  She  describes Edna's agony in a way that is surprisingly modern.  Although it  is difficult to sympathize with a woman who is not mired in poverty and who  has a great deal to be thankful for, I understand that she feels stifled by  a lifestyle that does not suit her.  It is astonishing that a woman,  writing in the 1890's, would articulate this radical viewpoint.  She must  have received a great deal of criticism at the time.  This book does have  some flaws. Some of the key characters are not fully fleshed out.  Robert,  Edna's close friend, is a handsome and affectionate companion, but little  more.  Mr. Pontellier, Edna's husband, is an insensitive lout, who treats  his wife in the way that he would treat a pet. These caricatures weaken the  book.  I get the feeling that Chopin is so anxious to convey her  &quot;message&quot; that she feels the need to stereotype the men in Edna's  life. However, &quot;The Awakening&quot; is a book that articulates a  viewpoint that is way ahead of its time, and for that alone, it is worth  reading.ok that articulates a  viewpoint that is way ahead of its time, and for that alone, it is worth  reading.	2000-02-20

I have read most of the Bernhardt series of &quot;Justice&quot; books, featuring Ben Kincaid, the Tulsa, Oklahoma attorney.  Ben is a smart but nebbishy lawyer who is a soft-touch for a sob story and is so  non-materialistic that it is hard to believe that he is a lawyer at all.  In this novel, Bernhardt admits to borrowing quite a bit from Jonathan  Harr's excellent non-fiction work, &quot;A Civil Action&quot; (which was  later made into a movie starring John Travolta).  &quot;A Civil  Action&quot; is a superb book that deals with the long, drawn out  litigation instigated by bereaved parents whose children died of cancer in  Woburn, Massachusetts. With the help of a cocky attorney, the parents filed  suit against the owners of a factory whose workers allegedly dumped toxic  waste into the town's water supply.  Bernhardt oversimplifies a case that  was complex in the extreme.  By fictionalizing the Woburn, Massachusetts  case, Bernhardt attempts to explain litigation that was so convoluted that  the real-life jury had difficulty understanding the geological testimony  presented to it. I think that to use this real-life case as the subject of  a legal thriller is to cheapen a truly tragic event.  Admittedly, the book  does have some entertainment value.  There are some thrills, some violence  (a little overdone), and some interesting twists and turns. Finally the  various subplots come together at the end.  The problem is that Bernhardt  ties up the subplots a little too frantically and the loose ends come  together in a way that is rather unbelievable.  In addition, the wonderful  character, Christina, has little to do in this book.  I missed Christina's  sassiness which has livened up Bernhardt's books in the past. Ben, too,  comes across in &quot;Silent Justice&quot; as more of a cardboard character  than a flesh and blood human being.  All in all, not the worst in the  series, but far from the best.	2000-02-13

Who would have thought that John Grisham, the moralizing author of &quot;The Street Lawyer&quot; and &quot;The Testament&quot; would have the talent and the courage to write this hilarious dead-on satire?  Here is a  novel with no heroes, no romance, almost no violence and no courtroom  theatrics!  Yet Grisham keeps the reader's attention riveted with--of all  things--a tale about three washed up judges in a minimum-security federal  prison.  &quot;The Brethren,&quot; as these judges are called, cook up a  scam to make money while they are incarcerated.  The scam works  beautifully, with the help of a drunken lawyer named Trevor who works as  their courier to the outside world.  Much to the Brethren's glee, they  catch a very big fish in their net. What happens then is a roller-coaster  ride that kept me thoroughly entertained.  Among his many targets, Grisham  satirizes campaign finance abuses, the importance of style over substance  in the political arena, and &quot;country-club&quot; prisons for white  collar criminals. This is not a &quot;feel-good&quot; novel.  It is a story  for our times, in which greed and the lust for power take center stage.  For Grisham to write a book with no one to identify with or root for--a  book about anti-heroes who are all obnoxious, selfish, clever and devious,  is a huge departure for him.  I applaud him for his talent and for his  inventiveness in coming up with this original novel that departs from the  formulaic fiction that is so common today.	2000-02-06

The reason that I picked up &quot;Figure of Eight&quot; is that I loved Patrick Lynch's medical thrillers, &quot;Omega&quot; and &quot;Carriers&quot;.  I have no idea why he abandoned the medical thriller  genre at which he excelled.  This book is inferior to those earlier works.  &quot;Figure of Eight&quot; is about Ellen (formerly Yelena) Cusack, a  Russian emigre turned champion figure skater.  Although she has somewhat  fallen out of the limelight since her glory days, she is trying for a  comeback after her recent divorce.  Unfortunately, she is getting  threatening mail from a stalker and she is very frightened.  Pete Golding,  a security expert who is known for his hotheaded &quot;shoot first and ask  questions later&quot; style, is called in by Ellen's agent to investigate  the threat. The book deals not only with the threat, but with an  unidenified body found on Ellen's property. The book has an intriguing  plot, but the characters do not come to life.  Ellen is a remote &quot;ice  princess&quot;.  Pete is a loose cannon who has obvious emotional problems.  The stalker is the usual crazy whom you find in these types of thrillers.  What does work is the gradual unraveling of the truth about Ellen's past.  There are some surprising elements here that are unpredictable.  What lifts  the book up still more is the truly surpising ending.  Usually, thrillers  end with melodramatic fireworks, or  with a thud.  This book has a truly  creepy, spine-tingling ending that left me slightly breathless.  It is a  good touch by Lynch.  He does have an important message to convey.  The  price of being in the public eye is often very high indeed, given the  number of emotionally disturbed people who live vicariously through the  rich and famous people whom they &quot;admire to death&quot;.	2000-01-30

In this case, the serial killer is a cop who knows police procedure, who is a self-disciplined perfectionist, and who is so  thoroughly psychopathic that there is absolutely no way to reach him  emotionally.  He wreaks havoc in the lives of his wife, Tess and his  daughter, Samantha. He also destroys the lives of the many women whom he  kills without remorse. He is a thoroughly nasty piece of work.  Interestingly, the author does not go with the &quot;Mommy made me do  it&quot; excuse that so many serial killers use.  The villain, Jim Beckett,  is just evil, for whatever reason people become that way.  His evil nature  is not explained away by logic.  This is true to life, because often people  do horrible, inexplicable things and there is no logical explanation for  their actions.  Our heroine, Tess, is in danger because Jim (her husband  who has escaped from prison) has promised to kill her, so she turns to J.  T. Dillon, a trained ex-marine and former mercenary.  Unfortunately, his  character is a cliche.  He is a bitter young man who has contempt for his  parents and has given up on life.  Tess brings him back to the land of the  living and he helps her learn how to stand on her feet and feel more  self-confident in defending herself physically.  I liked the relationship  between J. T. and his interestingly drawn sister, Marion, a troubled FBI  Agent.  That relationship is one of the highlights of the book.  Very  rarely are sibling relationships developed well in thrillers, but Garder,  the author, took her time describing the dynamics of the relationship  between J. T. and Marion very nicely.  The dialogue is, for the most part,  fast-moving, and the tension is kept at a high level throughout. The book  is appropriately violent for this genre and the ending is exciting and  climactic.  If you like police procedurals, suspense and edge-of-your seat  tension, you might enjoy &quot;The Perfect Husband&quot;.oy &quot;The Perfect Husband&quot;.	2000-01-23

Chang-Rae Lee, in his novel &quot;A Gesture Life,&quot; writes about &quot;Doc Hata,&quot; a man who is not really a doctor, although he had once aspired to be one. He is the retired former owner of a surgical supply  store.  The problem with Doc Hata is that he has always been afraid to be  himself.  His desire has always been to maintain an image of propriety at  all times--never to offend, to always blend in with the suburban town where  he lives.  We find out, in a series of flashbacks, that he has led a  tortured life, especially during World War II, and his experiences have  maimed him emotionally.  Doc Hata has a stormy relationship with his  adopted daughter, who ironically is named &quot;Sunny,&quot; when she is  generally surly.  Doc Hata's relationships with his acquaintances ,  although seemingly pleasant on the surface, tend to be somewhat shallow. As  time passes, Doc Hata struggles to find out if there is time for an old man  to find some sort of redemption and meaning in his life.  Often, the  writing in &quot;A Gesture Life&quot; is stunning and brilliant.  There  were passages that brought tears to my eyes.  At other times, however,  Lee's writing is cryptic and puzzling.  The plot towards the end is a  little too complicated and meandering.  Too much happens in a short time.  However, the book is powerful, especially in the passages that deal with  the &quot;Comfort Women&quot; of World War II.  This is a complex work that  requires a great deal of effort on the part of the reader. However, it is  well worth the reader's effort to plumb the depths of &quot;A Gesture  Life.&quot;	2000-01-16

They have a hard time  figuring out how the murders are connected and whether or not a pathetic  mental patient who has been locked up for many years has some connection to  the killings.  Milo and Alex are likeable enough, but the book has some big  weaknesses.  It is too long.  The descriptions of the mental  hospital/prison (Starkweather) are lengthy and tedious.  Every scene is  described in exhaustive detail.  The middle of the book is slow-moving and  the ending is convoluted and not particularly suspenseful.  If Kellerman's  writing had been tighter, the book would have packed a greater wallop.  As  it is, my interest waned at least 100 pages before the long-awaited end.	2000-01-10

In &quot;The Last Dance,&quot; his 50th (!) 87th Precinct novel, McBain retains the freshness, the sassiness, and the cynicism laced with humor that have made this series so  outstanding. His wonderful characters never fail to entertain, even the  obnoxious Fat Ollie Weeks.  Fat Ollie is as politically incorrect as a  human being can be, yet he is a good detective with excellent instincts.  The other detectives, Carella, Kling and Brown, are back and they are all  wonderful.  This mystery, as usual, is multilayered, involving the  mysterious death of a reclusive old man, a young prostitute and an elderly  lady.  McBain is excellent at showing how police procedure works.  His  dialogue is natural and fast-moving.  He's simply the best at what he does.  The outcome of the mystery is not particularly surprising, but the way that  it is resolved is extremely entertaining.  Read it!	2000-01-09

Truman, in her latest &quot;Capital Crimes&quot; novel, delves into the world of scholarly skullduggery and murder at the Library of Congress. As usual, Truman has researched the background of her plot with care.  This  mystery deals with a diary and a map that was purportedly written by a  friend of Christopher Columbus.  The diary and map could possibly shed some  light on the accomplishments or perhaps the evil deeds of Christopher  Columbus during his trips to the New World.  Annabel Reed-Smith, a former  lawyer who is also an art expert, happens to be doing research in the  Hispanic section of the library when a murder occurs. Naturally, she  becomes embroiled in the investigation of the murder. The writing style is  breezy and casual and Truman works out the plot in a competent, albeit  unexciting, fashion. She may not be flashy, but Truman writes light  mysteries that are easy to take.	2000-01-02

In &quot;The Ladies Auxiliary,&quot; Tova Mirvis delves into the world of the Orthodox Jews of Memphis, Tennessee.  Mirvis exposes the close-knit nature of this community as well as the hypocrisy and the intolerance of  some of its members.  This novel could have been very heavy-handed, and at  times the message that we must be open-minded and less judgmental is laid  on a little too thickly.  However, the author makes some very canny moves.  Batsheva is an outsider who comes to Memphis as a convert to Judaism who  was formerly married to a native of Memphis. Her husband had tragically  died and she is now alone with her small child. Batsheva wants her child to  grow up in a loving environment.  She winds up shaking up the community  with her &quot;original&quot; ideas and boundless enthusiasm to try new  things.  However, Mirvis does not portray Batsheva simply as a free spirit  who is unjustly maligned by a parochial group of busybodies.  Batsheva  makes mistakes that are very serious and the members of the Ladies  Auxiliary are not totally wrong about Batsheva's impulsiveness and her lack  of judgment.  Although Batsheva may have acted as a catalyst to bring out  the problems in the community, she didn't cause them in the first place.  Mirvis points out that we are all human; we are all flawed.  Blaming one  another for our problems instead of working together to solve them may not  be the best way to go.  The writing, although not always elegant, is  honest, fresh and clear.  We care about these characters and their  problems.  The author offers no pat solutions. Mirvis has done a fine job  of shining a light on a special community, showing both its strengths and  its weaknesses.	2000-01-02

Take one conspiracy orchestrated by high-level government officials.  Add one beautiful heroine with a hunky guy trying to help her. Throw in high-tech gadgetry, some  chases, a little violence, and a surprise or two at the end.  What do you  get?  You get &quot;Saving Faith,&quot; a novel with not a shred of  originality, no character development and a tepid writing style.  I enjoyed  Baldacci's last novel, and I had high hopes for this one.  Unfortunately,  &quot;Saving Faith&quot; had no &quot;saving graces&quot;. I know that it  will be a best-seller because of the Baldacci name.  The movie rights will  be sold for a couple of million dollars. However, I do not recommend this  book because it is a tedious rehash of so many conspiracy novels that are  much better written than this one.  Specifically, the motivations of the  characters are cut-and-dried.  Either they are greedy and selfish or  altruistic and self-sacrificing.  The villains are so evil that they lose  all human characteristics.  The action is unexciting, for the most part.  All in all, this is a poor effort by Baldacci.	1999-12-26

In &quot;Timeline,&quot; he thoroughly researches a time period in the 1300's, and to make sure that we know this, Crichton includes an extensive bibliography at the end of the  book.  He also goes into some esoteric jargon concerning quantum physics,  which I admit I barely understood.  &quot;Timeline&quot; is about an  eccentric genius who comes up with an idea that enables his scientists to  &quot;fax&quot; people to another time period.  Most of the book takes  place in the 1300's in France.  Since I like history, I enjoyed the  esoteric details about life in the Middle Ages.  However, Crichton pays  little attention to character and plot development in this novel.  &quot;Timeline&quot; has several serious flaws.  The characters are  one-dimensional. The plot makes little sense.  It is like an &quot;Indiana  Jones&quot; or &quot;Perils of Pauline&quot; escapade, in which our heroes  are in constant danger, but somehow just manage to stay alive  (unbelievably).  The villains are completely nasty, with no gray areas.  However, since Crichton does have some storytelling skills, I did want to  see how it would all turn out in the end.  In the future, Crichton should  pay more attention to character and plotting.  The best research doesn't  make up for a novel without the basic elements of interesting and  well-developed characters and a carefully constructed plot.	1999-12-19

He has written a book with a great deal of complicated and technical scientific language, yet he makes the narrative exciting.  &quot;Sea Change&quot; deals with an environmental  threat that poses a tremendous danger to warm-blooded mammals in an area  near Washington State and Vancouver, British Columbia.  Powlik has a  background in biology and oceanography, and although the book is fiction,  there is a factual basis in what he writes.  &quot;Sea Change&quot; is  frightening in its implications and the action sweeps the reader along  until the end.

In &quot;Fortune's Rocks,&quot; Shreve tells a story of a fifteen-year-old girl who falls in love with a man three times her age.  The girl, whose name is Olympia, feels a strong attraction to John Haskell in spite of the  fact that he is married to a wonderful woman and has four children whom he  deeply loves.  John's and Olympia's love has a ripple effect on the lives  of their family and friends.  There is moral ambiguity here.  Although John  and Olympia are intelligent, responsible and, at heart, decent people, they  throw caution to the winds because of the passion that they feel for one  another. Shreve never insinuates herself into the book, which is a wise  choice.  It is up to the reader to decide whether or not anyone should hurt  his or her family and friends for the sake of a &quot;grand passion&quot;.  Does love have its own rules?  Should Olympia and John have restrained  themselves to save their reputations and to avoid hurting their loved ones?  The reader must decide.  &quot;Fortune's Rocks&quot; has several great  strengths.  Shreve's depiction of the characters is sharp and the dialogue  sounds very realistic for the time period (the turn of the century).  The  character of Olympia is beautifully drawn.  She is a person of enormous  personal strength and dignity.  She is willing to take the consequences of  her choices and she maintains a kind of integrity throughout the book.  The  reader cannot help but be sympathetic to her.  One of Shreve's other  strengths is her description of landscape.  This book takes place, for the  most part, on the coast of New Hampshire.  Shreve knows this world well,  and she makes the seascape part of the fabric of the novel, adding to its  beauty and power.  &quot;Fortune's Rocks&quot; entertains and holds the  reader's interest until the last page.	1999-12-15

Rendell's Inspector Wexford is a wonderful character.  He is not flashy, but he is thoughtful, witty and insightful.  I always enjoy reading about him and his cases.  This book deals with the abduction of two women and one  little girl.  It also explores the issues of domestic violence and its  ramifications, and the problem of the mob mentality and its  destructiveness. As you can see, the book is too busy.  It has too many  themes and they don't mesh well.  The middle of the book flags, although it  picks up some steam at the end.  To Rendell's credit, she doesn't attempt  to tie up every loose end, and she fleshes out most of the characters.  She  would do well to make the plot more focused, as it was in her last novel,  &quot;A Sight for Sore Eyes,&quot; a truly horrifying thriller.	1999-12-05

James Powlik, who holds a Doctorate in biological oceanography, does not  &quot;write down&quot; to his audience in &quot;Sea Change&quot;.  In fact,  this book has so much complex scientific jargon that there is a glossary in  the back.  This is pretty rare in a novel.  I love scientific thrillers, my  favorite of all time being &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;.  &quot;Sea  Change&quot; is not in that league.  However, it is terrifying in its  implications that our environment, in this case the ocean, could harbor  organisms so malevolent that they could kill people instantly and, under  the right conditions, even threaten people on land. In this case, the  villain is a floating organism that is partially man-made and had been  lying dormant, waiting to be activated under the right conditions.  When  this organism comes to life, the bodies start piling up with warp speed.  The book is marred by a few romantic cliches and the body count is a little  too high.  However, in spite of the melodramatic touches, Powlik has  written an exciting and frightening thriller that could give a reader  nightmares.	1999-11-21

Cornwell sensitively handles Kay's anguish over the loss of Benton.  &quot;Black Notice&quot; held my interest until the end.  Kay's relationship with Marino is wonderful; they're like two squabbling siblings who know each other's faults very well, and fight constantly.  However, they really love one another (platonically, of course).  The dialogue is believable and the forensic details absolutely fascinating.  The ending is a bit cliched, but it is not over the top.

Lisa See brings China alive for the reader.  She sets most of this novel in the countryside of modern day China and she uses flashbacks to fill in the  background of the story. She has the characters speaking in transliterated  Chinese, which adds to the verisimilitude and to the colorful nature of the  narrative.  I like the complexity of the characters, especially Liu Hulan,  who is extremely flawed, yet fascinating.  The author also effectively uses  topical subjects to make the book come alive, such as the use of child  labor in China to make products for export, the &quot;action-figure&quot;  craze (which brings to mind Pokemon and the like), the exploitation of  workers who labor under terrible conditions for little pay, and the shaky  relationship between the United States and China.  The mystery is not bad,  but it is a little too complicated and melodramatic at the end.  The book  could have been cut as well.  It is almost 400 pages, which seems a little  long.  However, Lisa See has a freshness and an originality that is missing  from most of the formulaic fiction that is written these days.	1999-11-07

Turow makes the unfortunate choice of writing the novel in the first person (a lawyer narrates) and  then switching to the third person throughout much of the book.  This  device is awkward and it weakens the narrative greatly.  Another problem is  that the book has no clear focus.  It veers between the pathetic plight of  a woman dying of ALS, her loser husband who must participate in a sting to  nab corrupt judges, and a female FBI agent who is exploring her identity.  The book lacks warmth, humor, suspense and frankly, it is not worth the  reader's time.	1999-10-17

The first two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books were splendid.  They had heart, warmth and imagination to spare.  &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; starts out well, but it goes downhill in the  second half. Rowling is too busy with a very complicated plot to inject the  humor and the warmth into this book that made the first two books so  delightful. The book should have been shorter by at least seventy-five  pages.  It drags in the last quarter and the ending is much too  plot-oriented.  The whimsical characters of the last book, such as Moaning  Myrtle and the house elf who keeps beating himself up (Dobbie, I think his  name was), are missing here and there are no new characters in this book to  equal them.  Rowling had mentioned in an interview that she wanted to  explore darker themes in her later books, but I think that she is going too  far in that direction.	1999-10-04

McCourt's family went to America and then back to Ireland. The story continues until Frank is  nineteen and leaving for America. The strength of the book lies in the  vivid characterizations, the honesty of the narrative and the beautifully  descriptive writing.  McCourt puts you in the town of Limerick with the  feckless McCourt family and their troubles. The book has its imperfections.  McCourt indulges in a great deal of repetition.  We hear over and over  again about a relative who was dropped on his head as a child.  Over and  over, McCourt's father goes to the pubs to drink up his wages.  There is an  inevitability to the suffering that is incredibly depressing.  The McCourt  family is reduced to begging, to painting their legs black in order to hide  the holes in their stockings and to living in a house with a sewer inside  used by the entire neighborhood.  &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is a story of  survival against great odds, and it breaks your heart to see people  suffering like this.  McCourt certainly captures the feeling of what it was  like to grow up in Ireland in abject poverty, suffering tremendous hunger  and humiliation on a daily basis.	1999-09-19

I enjoyed &quot;Vengeance,&quot; mostly because I liked the off-beat characters and the amusing dialogue.  The Lew Fonseca character is very funny.  Such characters as Lew's cut-rate therapist, the gun-toting  sidekick, Lew's alcoholic but warm-hearted friend, Flo, and the computer  hacker named Harvey are nicely portrayed.  The plot is not particularly  realistic or even all that interesting, but this book is worth reading for  the droll and fairly strange people that Kaminsky has created.	1999-09-13

Joe Antonelli is a fine protagonist and the book has sharp  dialogue and a brisk pace.  The problem is the last quarter of the book.  The resolutions to the crimes are too convoluted and unrealistic.  In an  attempt to keep the reader off balance, the author throws in too many  twists and turns.  He is game playing, which does not make for good  plotting.  Buffa should have reduced some of the plot complications at the  end, and he should have attempted to make the characters' motivations and  actions more realistic.  This book had the potential to be first rate, but  it missed because of the over-the-top ending.	1999-07-11

I am a little disconcerted about the similarities between &quot;Midwives&quot; and &quot;The Law of Similars&quot;.  Both deal with women in Vermont who practice non-traditional medicine and make mistakes  that get them in hot water.  The reasons that &quot;Similars&quot; is  better is that 1)  It has more humor. 2) It has a touching love story. 3)  It depicts the love between a father and his young child poignantly.  However, the case of the misguided homeopath is somewhat contrived and  unrealistic.  Nor do I believe that Fowler would have played fast and loose  with the law the way he did.  Bohjalian seems to be hung up on moral  ambiguities in life.  I have no problem with that per se, but he should  stick a little closer to reality.  However, in its favor, &quot;The Law of  Similars&quot; is an engrossing and a fast read, with snappy dialogue and  sharply delineated characters.  It is a step up from &quot;Midwives,&quot;  which was far too dark and depressing.	1999-07-06

How sad that the author of the truly wonderful &quot;The Beekeeper's Apprentice&quot; is reduced to writing pedestrian fiction like this.  Frankly, none of the books that King has written since &quot;The  Beekeeper's Apprentice&quot; has come close to the high level of quality  that she achieved with that book.  The characters and the plot in &quot;O  Jerusalem&quot; are dull and the relationship between Russell and Holmes is  extremely underwritten.  Gone is the wit and the humor that I loved in the  first book of the series. I finished the whole book, but it was a struggle.	1999-07-05

The character of Clara Rinker is one of the most delightfully orginal villains I have ever come across.  You  can't hate her even though she's a sociopath, because she's funny, smart  articulate and somewhat poignant. It's hilarious that she wants to strike  up a friendship with Carmel, a truly coldblooded witch.  Clara says that  she'd like a girlfriend, since she's never had one of those. I also love  the way Clara handles the hit men that are sent to get her.  The plot is  workmanlike, the dialogue is witty and clever and the ending is satisfying.  The character of Davenport is fine, especially since he doesn't come  across as infallible as so many police detectives do.  I recommend this  book to readers of police procedurals, especially to fans of Ed McBain.	1999-06-30

It is a heart-wrenching book that explores the moral dilemmas of people who take great risks in life.  Bohjalian writes well from a female perspective.  The  style, which uses journal entries, flashbacks and a first-person narrative  from a child's viewpoint is a little tedious at times, but it doesn't  detract from the power of the story.  The question is, &quot;Should a woman  who is not medically trained deliver babies at home? Do the advantages of  having a baby at home outweigh the disadvantages?&quot;  There is always  the possibility that a delivery will go bad, and it is not always possible  to get medical intervention in time.  &quot;Midwives&quot; deals with guilt  and how families interact under stress. It also addresses the question of  whether or not it is ethical to take unnecessary risks with other people's  lives.  The reader must decide how culpable Sybil is.  It is a question  that remains in the reader's mind long after the last page is turned.	1999-06-20

I am a public librarian, and I read &quot;Holes&quot; because it is a Newbery Award winner and because Sachar has an excellent track record.  &quot;Holes&quot; is a work of &quot;magical realism&quot; which  intertwines fantasy and reality in a completely inventive way.  Children  will read it on one level and young adults will read the book on a higher  level.  A few of the many themes that &quot;Holes&quot; deals with are the  pain of loss, the connection between generations, the resiliency of  children and the power of love to help people overcome seemingly  insurmountable obstacles.  The book is not for very young children, since  there are frightening scenes of death and violence.  I would recommend it  for mature children ages 13  and up.	1999-06-15

The strengths of the books are its dialogue, which is realistic, and the flashbacks to World War II, which are nicely done.  However, the plot of  the &quot;too beautiful woman who drives men mad&quot; has been done to  death (excuse the pun).  It is a tired cliche.  As the plot line dragged  on, and the red herrings piled up, I became restive.  The books could have  been edited and the ending was far too melodramatic.  The author's attempt  to make a downbeat book a little more upbeat by getting some couples  together at the end falls flat.  Elizabeth George, P. D. James and Ruth  Rendell do it better.	1999-06-13

It has a poor writing style and the dialogue is extremely stilted.  None of the characters is well-developed or even  remotely human.  The villain is a lunatic out of central casting.  Naturally, his crazy mother made him the madman that he became.  What an  original plot line!  The author knows his medicine, but if he wants to  attempt fiction once again, he should learn how to write believable  dialogue and how to create well-developed characters.	1999-06-06

Tom Perrotta has written a savvy and lively account that accurately describes the hell of high school.  In this book, not just high school, but a high school election, are the vehicles through which we see how  self-destructive people can be, as well as how certain types of pressure  often bring out the worst characteristics in people.  Although Perrotta's  characters are not terribly likeable, we sympathize with them because they  are so human.  We cannot say for sure, &quot;I would never act like  that!&quot;  Perrotta captures the pain of not being popular, the agony of  teenagers who cannot find their niche in life, and the misery of adults who  have lost their way.  &quot;Election&quot; is a gem, beautifully written  and an instant classic.	1999-06-03

I predict that this book will sink quickly without a trace.  &quot;Mortal Judgments&quot; (how's that for an original title) is a forgettable entry into the already overcrowded legal-medical thriller genre.  It has an  overly complicated and not too coherent plot with characters so forgettable  that as soon as I closed the book, I had to strain to remember what I had  read.  No cliche is left unused in this tired plot:  the mysterious and  unexplained death in the operating room, the spunky heroine (who is both a  doctor and a lawyer), the corpses that pile up because they are getting TOO  CLOSE TO THE TRUTH.  The ending is anticlimactic and rather dull, as our  heroine finds herself chased by her assailants.  Will she survive?  This is  a yawn.	1999-05-23

Coles, in her book &quot;Just Checking,&quot; chooses to make light of a very serious illness--obsessive compulsive disorder.  The strange thing is that it works.  By wisecracking about the rather odd things she did over  the years, and the way that her husband enabled her by going along with her  strange behavior, she places the reader inside her head.  While  entertaining us, Coles also shows us how logical this behavior seemed to  her at the time.  I was both horrified and amused, as contradictory as this  seems.  Coles has done a wonderful job of showing us how OCD takes over the  lives of its unfortunate victims until they go for the help that they need.  Fortunately, the author went for help, but unfortunately, she paid a steep  price for waiting so long. This book is touching, informative and  entertaining.  Coles is a talented and brutally honest writer.  She is to  be commended for telling it like it is; it must have been difficult for her  to bare her soul like this.	1999-05-23

One of my patrons has been nagging me for months to read this book, claiming that it is terrific.  Boy, is she ever wrong!  Although the book had possibilities, as it progressed, the writing  deteriorated steadily.  Sloan makes a mishmash of racism, police  procedurals, small town gossip, an ambitious reporter and many other  ingredients that are too muddled together.  Instead of a crisp resolution,  the book falls flat at the end.  I knew who the murderer was, so there was  little suspense there.  Sloan should have fleshed out her characters and  constructed a plot that was a little less busy and a little more  put-together.  The book was too long and it sagged after the middle.  Sloan  also hits the reader over the head with her message that we must be more  tolerant and less small-minded in our relationships with those whom we  perceive to be different from us.  I do not recommend &quot;An Isolated  Incident&quot; to readers who enjoy crisp writing and a sensible plot line.  I was quite disappointed.	1999-05-16

The story of Hanna and Michael, in my mind, is a metaphor for the brutality that the Germans perpetrated on their victims.  Hanna may  have had excuses for her behavior (everyone does), but in the end what she  did was very harmful to a young and impressionable boy.  Why does the  author segue from this odd relationship to a depiction of the horrors of  the Holocaust?  He is trying to force us to think about the moral choices  that people make in situations that are not simple or clear cut.  Is Hanna  morally innocent in her relationship with Michael and in the way that she  behaved in her former life?  Should she be forgiven by Michael and by her  other victims? Schlink raises these and other questions that make the  reader uncomfortable and that force us to think about difficult issues.  &quot;The Reader&quot; is intriguing and unnerving but it is also  unforgettable.	1999-05-02

She's got a precocious daughter, a troublesome ex-husband, some  threatening phone calls and a hot-blooded and overbearing Cuban fiance.  Boy, does she have her hands full!  Parker juggles all this well enough for  a while.  Unfortunately, as happens all too often in this genre, the ending  falls flat.  Parker introduces a stock psychopathic character as well as a  &quot;Perils of Pauline&quot; situation.  Will the spunky heroine survive?  Well, duh!  The ending doesn't satisfy and the solution to the mystery  isn't terribly enthralling.  Parker has talent, but she has to nail the  ending to get top marks for her novels.	1999-04-25

Scottoline is a talented author with a strong legal background.  Her characters are intriguing although the villains are a bit stereotyped.  The problem with this book is the plot.  It is too complicated and the ending  leaves many more questions unanswered than I would have liked.  Not every  loose end must be tied up, but the author left far too many dangling.  The  book, at 480 pages, is too long.  There is not enough plot to justify the  length.  It could have been edited better.  With a tighter plot and a more  focused ending, \\"Mistaken Identity\\" would have been a top-flight  legal thriller.  Instead it is a valiant effort that ultimately falls short  of its initial promise.	1999-04-18

Scott has a good mind and he writes about scientific matters without condescension.  However, he indulges in overwriting and purple prose, using many images such as &quot;an avalanche of unopened mail,&quot; and others  that are far worse.  With proper editing, Scott can put his fertile  imagination to good use in his next novel.  On the plus side, his dialogue  is OK and some of his characters are entertaining, but he uses the  stereotypes for Orientals that are so insulting:  The beautiful and spunky  Chinese spy who is tough as nails but is looking for a solid and hunky guy.  The horrible Chinese villain who tortures and mutilates his victims for  fun.  Scott has talent but he must learn to harness it and strive for a  more realistic writing style and fewer stereotypes.	1999-04-04

It is a harrowing exploration of the psyches of both the perpetrator and the victims of a sadistic crime.  The author interweaves three or four plot lines concerning  the victim's mother and grandmother, an alcoholic policeman and other  characters skillfully and seamlessly.  \\"Mary, Mary\\" is not a  \\"whodunit\\" and it is not a conventional mystery. Not only does  the author deal with a crime of terrible cruelty and its aftermath, but she  also shines a light on the secrets that we keep from ourselves and from  others. Parsons shows how these secrets fester and poison our  relationships; they sometimes destroy our lives. This is not a  \\"feel-good\\" book, but for a first novel, it is an extraordinary  achievement.	1999-03-14

Golden has done a masterful job of insinuating himself into the mind and the heart of a Japanese woman.  He describes her milieu to perfection.  The reader is transported in time to Japan, from the year 1929 until the years  following World War II.  Golden portrays the desperation of the geisha to  become successful.  He also shows us the hard work, the political  infighting and the scheming that are part of the &quot;game&quot;. This  book has much to say about the horrible plight of a Japanese woman who  depends on others for her livelihood.  She has to become the person that  others want her to be instead of expressing her own identity.  It is  heartbreaking.

If you like lexicography, if you are interested in Victorian England, and if diseases of the mind fascinate you, then read this book.  It is one of  the strangest accounts that I have ever read.  I devoured this book in one  sitting.  Winchester fascinates us with this story of the contribution that  a convicted murderer named William Minor, who was confined to an asylum for  the criminally insane, made towards the gargantuan Oxford English  Dictionary. This book is written sparely and elegantly. It could easily  have been a bloated tome, but Winchester pares the story down to its  essentials. The cliche that truth is stranger than fiction is certainly  borne out by this tale of obsession.  I use the word &quot;obsession&quot;  both in the sense of the paranoia that plagued William Minor during most of  his life and the obsession to create one of the most ambitious and  scholarly works of all time. Winchester does an admirable job of making  &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot; both accessible and intriguing.	1998-12-06
