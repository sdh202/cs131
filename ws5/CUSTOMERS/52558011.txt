You'll find the book stronger in intensity than many of the photographic collections of September 11, 2001.<br /><br />Why? Dennis Smith was a fireman who understood tragedy from an experienced viewpoint. Like all of us, he saw the worst of humankind crash into the World Trade Center. Then, he saw the best of humankind enter those same buildings to save the victims.<br /><br />Now, three years later, after many in America have preferred to see terrorism as a political event and not one of evil and hate, it is important to remember the violent images, and the tender responses to the hurting and scared. America was in one its greatest moments in those torrid days, and we should never forget.<br /><br />Smith's descriptions are more than photo-realistic versions of what he saw, but brings forth the anguish and passion, and the smell of wet ash and burning debris. Smith manages to connect with the reader beyond the hype and politics. You will not be able to read this unaffected.<br /><br />The people in the high-rises, on the planes, and the policemen and fireman all were real people. Even the foolish young men who hijacked the planes, the ones who believe Bin Laden -- all real people who died for another man's lie. Smith draws out the real, draws out the essence as well as the actual accounts of the awful events.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Report from Ground Zero: The Story of the Rescue Efforts at the World Trade Center\\" by Dennis Smith.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2005-10-05

This book demythologizes John, and his first marriage.<br /><br />\\"John\\" by Cynthia Lennon is the story about who they were before they met, about Cynthia's marriage to the famous Beatle, how John ran off with Yoko, and how she managed after his rejection to resolve things amicably. We see John the person, and not as much of John the musician.<br /><br />History knows most of what happened during John's short life. Few details have been left uncovered. Most of what is known about the former Cynthia Powell is in the shadow of John Lennon. What she does here is shine the light on the John Lennon she knew, revealing John's own shadows and dark side.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is candid.<br /><br />She remarks how John, the world peacemaker, said, \\"Give peace a chance,\\" as he lay in bed with Yoko. Young son Julian watched at home, asking his mother why his father was with another woman. John, she asserts, was very good to his fans, even at the height of the Beatles' popularity.<br /><br />There are plenty of Beatle stories here, retold from the vantage of an active participant. Some of it is familiar territory to any fan of the Fab Four. Because of the Beatles' well-documented history, the context is easy to follow. From John's first time hitting on Cynthia while she was still engaged to someone else, to her description of how she processed John's death and George's deadly cancer, and what happened to all those who were part of the John Lennon story.<br /><br />\\"John\\" is not in the least sentimental. John's drug use is mentioned matter-of-factly. The slow realization that John was methodically cheating on her with Yoko is covered, as is his casual admission that he had otherwise been frequently unfaithful with many other women.<br /><br />This is not a John Lennon the seer love fest. Somehow, though, despite John's selfish arrogance during their marriage and later rejection, she seems to have loved him throughout.<br /><br />How much of this is true? After all, wasn't she the one he left? Isn't she bitter that John did not love her as much as he once claimed? Doesn't that anger filter her choice of stories and wording? Cynthia herself ran through three husbands before settling on her fourth and current spouse. She was not then, is not now naive, and surely understands the ramifications of \\"John\\" on John Lennon lore.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"John\\" by Cynthia Lennon. It may not be the whole, unadulterated truth, but it should help hardcore fans sort through the mass of rumor, hogwash and facts residing about Lennon in popular culture.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.compite John's selfish arrogance during their marriage and later rejection, she seems to have loved him throughout. <br /> <br />How much of this is true?

Tony Randall. Those are two names known to anyone over 35, and to plenty of people younger, thanks to the legendary TV series, \\"The Odd Couple.\\" Fewer of us know about their extended career acting on stage before and long after the series. In between those years, a complex relationship was built that did not follow the Hollywood style.<br /><br />\\"Tony And Me: A Story of Friendship\\" gives Jack Klugman's point of view on how they interacted and grew closer. Beginning before anyone heard of them, and ending with Tony's death in May 2004, it developed a richness that I envy.<br /><br />Klugman self-published \\"Tony and Me,\\" knowing that more profit would be made available for Randall's beloved National Actors Theater. The fact that Klugman did not rely on a bevy of editors and marketers shape what he said created a personal voice that avoids patting himself on the back and indulging in name-dropping. Instead, he comes across conversational and friendly.<br /><br />Klugman explains how he and Randall saw life differently, not too dissimilarly as Oscar and Felix, but that it was their common love and training in theater that connected them.<br /><br />He never delves into kiss and tell, sparing us from any lurid gossip that may have surrounded either in the heyday. Like a eulogy, he tells fond stories of the two of them together, and, most of all, why Randall mattered in his life.<br /><br />One significant story Klugman tells is about his throat cancer, and subsequent surgery that dealt a blow to his voice. Randall was the one who encouraged him most to return to theater. Without a decent voice, this would be impossible, but Randall let Klugman know he would help him get back on stage if he wanted to try. Klugman tried, and they eventually starred together in \\"The Sunshine Boys\\" in the National Actors Theater. More than a professional victory, this personal triumph humbled Klugman in a new way. He realized the formation of a solid friendship, that after 30-some years of working together, they were more than a team.<br /><br />Jack Klugman does not gush, or gab. A short book, it focuses on friendship more than the events that surrounded them. At the book's end, he admonishes readers to set aside grudges and to realize that friendship and the bond it creates is bigger than pride.<br /><br />The \\"Odd Couple\\" outtakes DVD is a collection of goof ups from the series. Klugman adds to his book with this, giving the reader an immediate reminder of what put both of them on the map, and the kind of connection they had in the in-between times.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Tony and Me: A Story of Friendship\\" by Jack Klugman.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comafter 30-some years of working together, they were more than a team. <br /> <br />Jack Klugman does not gush, or gab.

Why \\"Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People\\"?<br /><br />In some cases, what Covey says the rest all say. The biggest difference is the process, not the method.<br /><br />In audio form, it lacks. The listener, who may be commuting, is not able to process the ideas. What works as a book is less effective as audio. This is by no means a criticism of Covey's challenges, but of the device he uses to impart them.<br /><br />Covey's \\"Seven Habits\\" are like eating properly during the gestation of your baby. The short-term results are hard to realize, but the foundation for good health are laid. Follow what Covey says, and in the long-term, you will be highly effective.<br /><br />Covey starts with explaining that the first step isn't external, but internal. It isn't just that Covey is trying to get you to feel good about your abilities. Instead, he wants you prepared for the hard work the seven habits will require. In fact, Covey deplores the cheap 'character ethic' method, noting it evolved away from character, and more into quick-fix influence techniques.<br /><br />He separates influence and character, and wants the reader to know influence without character is not good. \\"Only basic goodness gives life to technique.\\" The book is not a lesson in technique.<br /><br />The Seven Habits are divided into chapters:<br /><br />1- Be Proactive<br /><br />2- Begin with the End in Mind<br /><br />3- Put First Things First<br /><br />4- Think Win/Win<br /><br />5- Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood<br /><br />6- Synergize<br /><br />7- Sharpen the Saw<br /><br />Covey, despite how it is a management and professional growth book, has also written a personal growth book. It is not a relationship book, as in the sense John Gray writes, or a weight loss book, like Dr. Phil writes. Fans of \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" by Johnson will connect.<br /><br />Though Covey won't charge at the reader by asking him to repeat a mantra of \\"I think I can. I think I can,\\" he does show the reader the ways of realigning their perspective, their goals and their strengths for the greater good of both the listener, and those he interacts with.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.coming him to repeat a mantra of \\"I think I can.

Augmented now by his book, \\"Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential\\" he pushes the find the god/champion within yourself.<br /><br />Here, we see he has a study guide to help point out what is not difficult to understand with his book. To his credit, there are a few more Scriptures laced into this guide. However, the main book is not making any points that a study guide will enhance, and only the lowliest of sheep will need the extra help.<br /><br />People who are down on their luck, or discouraged with life will find Osteen a good read. It is a feel-good book, reducing the image of Christianity to be about us and not about God. Bigger than life is Osteen's picture on the cover, knowing that if you saw him on TV, you might want his book.<br /><br />\\"Getting your mind off of yourself,\\" with the goal of self-fulfillment should appeal also to readers of Wayne W. Dyer and other authors looking to reach those who feel disenfranchised.<br /><br />Osteen's rambling, choppy speaking style comes through, written like he's campaigning for office. Reading like a seminar set to print, it sums as quickly as reading through its self-determinist table of contents:<br /><br />1. Enlarge your vision<br />2. Develop a healthy self-image<br />3. Discover the power of your thoughts and words<br />4. Let go of the past<br />5. Find strength through adversity<br />6. Live to give<br />7. Choose to be happy<br /><br />The steps sound innocuous, and, outside of their religious context, are. Within their religious context, evangelicals and charismatics will likely find offense at Osteen's assertions about controlling your own destiny as opposed to letting God control it.<br /><br />Aim a little higher, and check out Charles Colson's \\"The Good Life.\\" The title sounds similar, but Colson defines what makes for a good life far differently than Osteen. Save your money, and if you have Osteen's book, read it without the guide.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comve your money, and if you have Osteen's book, read it without the guide.

Later, as a private tutor, my students chose this again and again. \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins\\" lives up to its reputation as one of the greatest children's book ever.<br /><br />Libraries are good for borrowing books, but some books should be on the shelf of any young reader. Scott O'Dell's magnificent \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins\\" is just that. Save your librarian some grief and buy a copy.<br /><br />\\"The Island of the Blue Dolphins\\" is not the story of a foolish young girl who missed the boat when the island was being evacuated. Far from it. Karana was on the boat. Her playful little brother, Ramo, wasn't. He was only 6 years old and could never survive alone. She jumped off and headed to shore to save him. The boat left.<br /><br />Every little girl or boy has been alone, frightened without a clear way of finding his or her way home. Often, the problem is fixed by turning the next corner, finding out it is the same neighborhood it has always been. In the case of \\"The Island of the Blue Dolphins,\\" Karana's home never changes. Everyone she knows and loves, however, leaves.<br /><br />For 18 years Karana took care of herself, and she grows from a preteen child into a woman just entering her 30s. This is that story, filled with adventures similar to \\"Robinson Crusoe,\\" another true story set to fiction. Fans of \\"Swiss Family Robinson,\\" will likewise enjoy this.<br /><br />Karana's ingenuity to survive is surpassed by her tenacity and hope. Weathering hard circumstances, such wild dogs, storms and the constant need to find fresh food and good water. She uses what she learned from her parents and other villagers before the left, and what she learns by trial an error.<br /><br />As exciting as \\"Treasure Island,\\" only with a female protagonist, the book is more than a tale of heroics. Scott O'Dell's keen sense of description separates this from the rest of the bookshelf. Although sensitive that his reader is younger, he still manages to place to reader in the story, imagining the smell of sea or hearing the not-so-far off bark of wild dogs.<br /><br />Like other classics as \\"Old Yeller\\" and \\"My Brother Sam Is Dead,\\" not everything comes easily to Karana. There are somber times when people leave, when her brother dies, or when things look bleak. O'Dell tells the story as realistically as he can, which makes the happy times happier.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins,\\" by Scott O'Dell. It won \\"The Newberry Medal for Best Children's Book\\" for good reason.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comAlthough sensitive that his reader is younger, he still manages to place to reader in the story, imagining the smell of sea or hearing the not-so-far off bark of wild dogs.  <br /> <br />Like other classics as \\"Old Yeller\\" and \\"My Brother Sam Is Dead,\\" not everything comes easily to Karana.

His mother demanded that the prince be sure. Each time the prince met someone he fell in love, she failed the test. One could not play soft music, another ate like a pig, and still another could not dance.<br /><br />When a rainstorm brought in a young tiger who claimed to be a princess, the queen decided to lay out 20 mattresses with a pea beneath them all. Would the young tiger sense the pea and prove she was a real princess?<br /><br />The story is all there. The problem is that there is nothing exciting in the language. There is no alliteration or assonance, and no word play. The writer goes through the motion of storytelling without ever bringing the story from her heart into the child's.<br /><br />Better retellings are out there, and the illustrations, as good as they are, are not so much as to make the book a worthy purchase.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2005-09-20

With art which remind readers of Virginia Burton's \\"Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel,\\" and a story with a message not unlike \\"The Little Engine That Could\\" Watty Piper, it is a classic.<br /><br />The Plot:<br /><br />Little Toot is a tugboat who, though he could create a sound, could create smoke. Like in \\"The Story of Ferdinand\\" by Munro Leaf, Little Toot liked to spend his days peacefully. He would play instead of work, spinning Figure 8s. Other tugboats teased him, and soon, Little Toot had no friends.<br /><br />One day, Little Toot wanders into the ocean, a deep and scary place, and so he sent an SOS smoke signal. The tugs all came to his rescue, but the waves held them back.<br /><br />\\"Little Toot\\" is an adventure story for younger children. The smallest boat becomes a hero, like the young angel in \\"The Littlest Angel\\" by Charles Tazewell.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Little Toot\\" by Hardie Gramatky.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2005-09-20

Murky, brownish, darkish green pictures fill the book in dramatic two-page spreads, capturing the action of each page.<br /><br />This is not a great book; it is a fun book. Reading it is like playing in a puddle, or squishing wet clay into a new shape.<br /><br />Toads, when it comes down to the nitty-gritty, are creatures that dwell in mud, eat vile things, and neither taste nor smell pleasant. Brown tells us about the toad as it really is.<br /><br />The vocabulary, with words like septic, toxic, bitter, venomous, and my favorite, trundle, will sometimes be beyond most children. They will learn new words as they return to the book again and again.<br /><br />I enjoyed it the way I enjoy Oscar the Grouch. Have fun with this one.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2005-09-20

That's why teens are reading this book. That is why more often than not, they enjoy it more than writers like William Faulkner.<br /><br />J. D. Salinger was not a shock artist. He did not use offensive themes and language to stir up publicity and talk about freedom of speech. He employed his freedom of speech as a tool to communicate, not to infuriate. As a result, he wrote a magnificent book looking into the psyche of youth. What makes Salinger a classic writer, and wealthy publicity hounds like Eminem and Howard Stern noisy wannabes is that within his language, there is truth.<br /><br />While Holden searches for himself, and the meaning of life, he was a younger version of those in the Beat movement, or James Dean. Readers go from \\"Catcher\\" to Jack Kerouac's \\"On the Road,\\" with the same easygoing, streaming thoughts kind of way.<br /><br />\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" grabs at the introspective self. Like so many of the Oprah books are for women, \\"Catcher\\" is the for teen male. (Did I offend the teens guys, or the Oprah fans?)<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" It is close to being a literary masterpiece, and will intrigue even the passive reader.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2005-09-19

Beauty and sadness, grief and romance. \\"Annabel Lee\\" is like it, and \\"Ulalume\\" will bend your heart to weeping. These aren't the only poems here, but they are among the reasons you will reread this small volume of poetry.<br /><br />Lamenting the loss of a gentle but passionate woman, the narrator drinks, yet somberly dwells on her name. A local raven, with the capacity to utter like a parrot a syllable or two, repeats the speaker's chant \\"Lenore,\\" as \\"Nevermore.\\" The narrator, tired and broken, believes the raven might be sent by God or even by the Devil, and tries talking with it.<br /><br />Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br />Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,--<br />While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br />As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br />\\"'T is some visitor,\\" I muttered, \\"tapping at my chamber door;<br />Only this and nothing more.\\"<br /><br />The poem, like a long tale, draws the listener or reader to be in that lonely room.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever been in love and lost that lover will known Poe's pain and supplication of God.<br /><br />Similar to the Raven in its message is \\"Annabel Lee,\\" as the poet declares his grief over his lost lover. This love here is one he knew as a young teen, and whose love even the angels were jealous of.<br /><br />It was many and many a year ago,<br />In a kingdom by the sea,<br />That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br />By the name of Annabel Lee;<br />And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br />Than to love and be loved by me.<br /><br />Slightly lesser known is \\"Ulalume.\\" It will remind readers of \\"The Raven,\\" in its storytelling structure, though the poetry behind it is somewhat different. Like many of Poe's poetry, rhythm, alliteration and near internal rhymes lift the poem up high. It is somber, driven by gray images of sadness.<br /><br />The Skies they were ashen and sober;<br />The leaves they were crisp&egrave;d and sere,<br />The leaves they were withering and sere;<br />It was night in the lonesome October<br />Of my most immemorial year;<br />It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,<br />In the misty mid region of Weir:<br />It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,<br />In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Raven And Other Poems,\\" by Edgar Allan Poe, and look into a fuller collection including his stories, and more poetry.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comthey were withering and sere;   It was night in the lonesome October   Of my most immemorial year;  It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,   In the misty mid region of Weir:   It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,   In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book.<br /><br />In \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life.<br /><br />Of course, \\"Old Man,\\" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy.<br /><br />A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?<br /><br />As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2005-09-19

I also found lists dividing reliable cars by price range, which cars have had recalls, unreliable models (by year), and detailed descriptions of the pros and cons of each vehicle.<br /><br />That's not all.

Lennie and George want this independence more than most men, but have less than most men to get there. In their case, it isn't a white picket fence, but a farm where they can raise rabbits.<br /><br />Lennie is not a bright man. He desires to care for someone and to be loved, but is unable to think past his own fear.

It will challenge your arteries, but delight your soul. Your stomach will be happy too. Here, you will find recipes proving that.<br /><br />Fintor explains in a brief introduction a history of Hungarian cuisine. She writes how, despite its present unique place in the culinary world, it began as an amalgamation of French, Italian, Turkish, German and Transylvanian food.<br /><br />While not exactly useful to the American cook, she has a section on Hungarian language. Now, you can pronounce the dish names when your Hungarian date comes over for dinner. If things work out, you will impress your spouse's family too.<br /><br />More practical to most readers is her section on how to interpret the recipes, and what ingredients you will need handy. The difference this makes is important, like that vinegar to be used is distilled white, and that butter should be the salted kind.<br /><br />Keyed into the needs of beginning cooks, Fintor provides some useful tips, a glossary of basic cooking terns (like dredge, dice, trussing, and what roux is).<br /><br />Recipes are the bulk of the book, with some black and white pictures of dishes. The layout is easy on the eyes. Directions are straightforward. Occasionally, she gives ideas to adapt the recipe to an American context, in case the ingredients are somewhat different. The only significant drawback is the hardcover design, which makes keeping it open while cooking difficult.<br /><br />The recipe sections are as follows, each with an introduction:<br /><br />Appetizers, relishes, and sauces<br />Salads<br />Soups<br />Biscuits, dumplings, and noodles<br />Poultry<br />Meats<br />Vegetables<br />Desserts<br />Breads<br />Wines (no recipes, just an introduction).<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Hungarian Cookbook: Old World Recipes for New World Cooks\\" by Yolanda Nagy Fintor.

As a literary critic, he took on the process a book was published, not just the book itself. He understood the industry and what it took to run a magazine, having been an editor and publisher at various parts of his short career.<br /><br />Quoting liberally from source material, Moss presents Poe as a one-man soldier against the machine. Literary magazines, as in any era, had a clique system based on connections, trust and experience.<br /><br />Poe was the consummate insider-outsider with a slowly growing following of readers as a poet and short-story writer, a fiery relationship as an editor, and outspoken beliefs about literary theory.<br /><br />Highlighting specific recorded incidents, Moss adds to the body of knowledge with his close examination of the issues.<br /><br />First, Moss glances through Poe's critical career, from 1835-1849 (his death). He shows how Poe was stirred to write reviews to attack the gatekeepers. Moss sees Poe as more influential than he probably was, or presumes Poe as more of a megalomaniac. Aptly noted, though, is Poe's arguments for international copyright laws and creating acquisition standards in publishing.<br /><br />Subsequent chapters range in explaining the players Poe would be aligning with or fighting, to his own political missteps, and the details of various tussles. Henry Longfellow, R. W. Griswold, Lewis Clark were all duelists with Poe's pen.<br /><br />Contradictions among the literary coterie are discussed, whether it was illegally reprinting European authors while taking a stand against the profitable practice, or declaring the strengths of an American national literature while decrying the quality of work written in the United States.<br /><br />Moss's book is, in fact, more than Poe's difficulties with the literary world, but that world's own disputes and internal struggles.<br /><br />Outside of making Poe into a martyr, Moss does a fine job of showing the milieu of conflict around Poe in an important time of national identity. The usually over-romanticized life of a delirious Poe is shown as foolish when reading the examples of brilliant intellect and strategy employed by Poe.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Poe's Literary battles: The Critic in the Context of His Literary Milieu\\" by Sidney Moss.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comre than Poe's difficulties with the literary world, but that world's own disputes and internal struggles.

Later, as a private tutor, my students chose this again and again. \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins\\" lives up to its reputation as one of the greatest children's book ever.<br /><br />Libraries are good for borrowing books, but some books should be on the shelf of any young reader. Scott O'Dell's magnificent \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins\\" is just that. Save your librarian some grief and buy a copy.<br /><br />\\"The Island of the Blue Dolphins\\" is not the story of a foolish young girl who missed the boat when the island was being evacuated. Far from it. Karana was on the boat. Her playful little brother, Ramo, wasn't. He was only 6 years old and could never survive alone. She jumped off and headed to shore to save him. The boat left.<br /><br />Every little girl or boy has been alone, frightened without a clear way of finding his or her way home. Often, the problem is fixed by turning the next corner, finding out it is the same neighborhood it has always been. In the case of \\"The Island of the Blue Dolphins,\\" Karana's home never changes. Everyone she knows and loves, however, leaves.<br /><br />For 18 years Karana took care of herself, and she grows from a preteen child into a woman just entering her 30s. This is that story, filled with adventures similar to \\"Robinson Crusoe,\\" another true story set to fiction. Fans of \\"Swiss Family Robinson,\\" will likewise enjoy this.<br /><br />Karana's ingenuity to survive is surpassed by her tenacity and hope. Weathering hard circumstances, such wild dogs, storms and the constant need to find fresh food and good water. She uses what she learned from her parents and other villagers before the left, and what she learns by trial an error.<br /><br />As exciting as \\"Treasure Island,\\" only with a female protagonist, the book is more than a tale of heroics. Scott O'Dell's keen sense of description separates this from the rest of the bookshelf. Although sensitive that his reader is younger, he still manages to place to reader in the story, imagining the smell of sea or hearing the not-so-far off bark of wild dogs.<br /><br />Like other classics as \\"Old Yeller\\" and \\"My Brother Sam Is Dead,\\" not everything comes easily to Karana. There are somber times when people leave, when her brother dies, or when things look bleak. O'Dell tells the story as realistically as he can, which makes the happy times happier.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins,\\" by Scott O'Dell. It won \\"The Newberry Medal for Best Children's Book\\" for good reason.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.como place to reader in the story, imagining the smell of sea or hearing the not-so-far off bark of wild dogs.

Chronologically presented by the year the poet was born, dating from B&aacute;lint Balassi (1554) to Istv&aacute;n Kormos (1923), readers are treated to a cross-section sampling of some of the greatest poets and poetry.<br /><br />The left page in each spread in Hungarian. The right is in English. The editors have used this layout even for the table of contents, with lists each poet, the years he lived, and the poems of his which are included.<br /><br />Enjoy now taste of what's here, with the first stanza from Endre Ady's poem \\"P&aacute;risban J&aacute;er Az Õsz\\" (Autumn Appeared in Paris):<br /><br />P&aacute;risban tegnap besz&ouml;k&ouml;tt az Õsz.<br />Szent Mih&aacute;ly &uacute;tj&aacute;n neszetelen,<br />K&aacute;nikul&aacute;ban, halk lombok alartt<br />S tal&aacute;lkozott velem.<br /><br />Autumn appears in Paris yesterday.<br />Silent down St. Michel its swift advance,<br />In stifling heat under unmoving branches<br />We met as if by chance.<br /><br />Poets included:<br />Balassi, Zr&iacute;nyi, Faludi, Bats&aacute;nyi, Fazekas, Vit&eacute;z, Berzsenyi, K&ouml;lcsey, V&ouml;r&ouml;smarty, Arany, Petõfi, Vajda, Kiss, Reviczky, Ady, Somly&oacute;, Babits, Juh&aacute;sz, Sz&eacute;p, Kosztol&aacute;nyi, T&oacute;th, Kass&aacute;k, F&uuml;st, S&aacute;rk&ouml;zi, Szab&oacute;, Illy&eacute;s, J&oacute;zsef, Dsida, Radn&oacute;ti, Vas, K&aacute;lnoky, We&ouml;res, J&eacute;kely, Csan&aacute;di, Pilinszky, Nagy, Kormos.<br /><br />In all, 23 translators are credited. Occasionally, the English comes off less poetically as a result, having that translated sound to it. Rhyme schemes are kept dutifully, as is line breakage. In doing so, the meter is sometimes clunky or forced. As can happen with so many translators, both British and American English usage occurs throughout the anthology.<br /><br />George Szirtes, perhaps best known for his English translation of \\"Anna Edes\\" by Dezsõ Kosztol&aacute;nyi, dominates the number of translations.<br /><br />Missing, and therefore not as useful in an academic setting, are an introduction, basic biographies, and essays discussing themes and issues. These poets deserve the kind of work W. W. Norton publishes through its anthologies and critical editions.<br /><br />As a nice cultural touch, Corvina typeset the volume in the very readable Janson typeface, which was designed in the 17th century by Hungarian Mikl&oacute;s T&oacute;tfalusi Kis (previously attributed to Anton Janson).<br /><br />An update is necessary as well. Most of the poets wrote long before the infection of Communism, but an update would allow the presentation of poets no longer shackled in their ability to speak freely.<br /><br />I received mine as a gift purchased very inexpensively in Hungary, so keep your eyes open for a good price.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Lost Rider: A Bilingual Anthology.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comtical editions.

Be ready when the inmate becomes an ex-offender to best help him or her succeed in life, and in faith.<br /><br />It is one those few religious books that both liberal and conservative Christians can agree on.<br /><br />Who should read this book? Christians who are either involved directly in inmate ministry, pastors and lay people whose church may have ex-offenders and will be involved in the ex-offender's life, and families or friends of the ex-offender. That covers a lot of people, and such is the nature of the life of a Christian.<br /><br />When an inmate is released from incarceration, and becomes, at that point, an ex-offender, he or she faces a myriad of challenges.<br /><br />Major topics include ideas for:<br />* helping ex-offenders become self-sufficient<br />* providing structure and stability<br />* modeling unconditional love through affirmation and forgiveness<br />* discouraging destructive habits and how to form new ones<br />* offering a caring worship environment<br /><br />Provided are appendices for locating prison ministries, churches ministering in jails and prisons, correspondence courses, and a very important \\"Practical and Professional Guidelines for Jail and Prison Ministry Volunteers.\\"<br /><br />Additionally, read sections on finding a church, dealing with the old personality although he is a new person (after salvation), managing the inordinate amount attention an ex-offender may seek, the risks involved in loving an ex-offender, and a church's role in helping an ex-offender's success on the outside.<br /><br />Smarto backs things up with the results of research, statistics, and examples within his own work.<br /><br />Key to this book's usefulness is the frank discussion. Smarto wants that the reader to be wise in their approach in helping the ex-offender. No sugarcoating, and no sensationalizing. Like in any ministry or missions effort, this is work. Smarto provides tools for getting it done.<br /><br />Smarto, both an intellectual and practitioner in inmate ministry, has headed up Wheaton College's acclaimed Institute for Prison Ministry and led several prison ministries. He's worked with drug and alcohol abuse, gangs, and spoken worldwide on inmate evangelism. His credibility is multilateral, and his guidance in \\"Keeping Ex-Offenders Free!: An Aftercare Guide\\" is valuable.

Consider this a gimmee. Buy this year's edition. Buy next year's edition. Plan on the following year as well.<br /><br />What you need to know about this edition:<br /><br />* 1,180 markets. Pick a Christian denomination (Catholic and Protestant), and their publication is likely listed.<br /><br />* Almost 700 periodicals, over 350 book publishers. Think of how many you are aware of? \\"Christianity Today,\\" \\"New Man,\\" \\"Decision\\" are probably at the top of your mind for periodicals. Tyndale, NavPress, InterVarsity Press are probably among the book publishers you know. Maybe you know a few more. Here, you'll discover how vast the Christian publishing world is.<br /><br />Literary agents, contests, advice for various markets, editorial services, market analyses, specialty markets (like greeting cards) all have sections.<br /><br />If you are looking to connect with other writers, you'll be happy to find the lists of writers' groups and clubs, and for conferences and workshops. A key group is the Evangelical Press Association, but there are smaller ones geared for denominations and market.<br /><br />The structure is similar to previous editions, but, as always, the current year provides the most accurate data.<br /><br />Each publication starts with symbols indicating if it is new, if the data is confirmed, and if they pay. There's the title, the contact info including a URL, an editor's name, a brief description, the page count and circulation number, the subscription cost, percentage freelanced, submission preference, payment style, and general content needs.<br /><br />Missing but I hope soon changing, is a purely digital version. Searching through a book to find, for example, what periodicals pay for poetry, can be frustrating when I know a sensible CD version would allow me a complete list within seconds.<br /><br />Weak also are listings for foreign markets, but this may as much a fault of the publisher as the guide's editor, or may be due to the limited number of international Christian publications.<br /><br />Add up the above, and you will see how any writer aiming for the Christian market at large would find this an indispensable volume. It fills in the gaps left open by the very useful \\"Writer's Digest\\" market guides, and provides the required tools for connecting writer and publisher.<br /><br />I fully recommend the \\"Christian Writers' Market Guide,\\" as it remains the best option for any Christian writer.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.como the limited number of international Christian publications.

I sang many of these as a youth at Catholic Mass, and later, as I have regularly attended Protestant services. Not only did I enjoy reading the lyrics in the quiet of my living room, but I also learned more about the intended meaning of each song.<br /><br />Significant Songs (just a few of another 50 I could list)<br />* \\"O Sacred Heart Now Wounded\\"<br />* \\"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\\"<br />* \\"Joy to the World!\\"<br />* \\"The First Noel\\"<br />* \\"O Holy Night\\"<br />* \\"O How I Love Jesus\\"<br />* \\"I Love to Tell the Story\\"<br />* \\"Beulah Land\\"<br />* \\"Nothing But the Blood\\"<br />* \\"God of Our Fathers\\"<br />* \\"Softly and Tenderly\\"<br />* \\"I'll Fly Away\\"<br />* \\"Will the Circle Be Unbroken?\\"<br /><br />Christian hymns are part of world music, going back hundreds of years. Whether written by a repentant slave owner or a Catholic priest who believes scripture should be in the common man's language, or as an extension of a theologian's great poetic skill, the stories of the classics are anything but ordinary.<br /><br />What impressed me was the easy style of Morgan's writing as he explained the theology and origin of the songs. Each song receives one page describing its author and history.<br /><br />I learned, for example, \\"Will the Circle Be Unbroken?\\" by Ada Ruth Habershon isn't a secular song of generic faith sung only by folk singers, but a rich song of longing for eternity in Heaven specifically for Christians.<br /><br />I like that Morgan included \\"Away in the Manger\\" and other Christmas carols. In the Christmas holiday context, they feel like simple ditties, but reading the lyrics showed me how many started as hymns sung throughout the year as worship.<br /><br />A downside of the book was the organization. Morgan researched this carefully and grouped the hymns chronologically. Each song gets its own entry. In many cases, specific material was lacking, or, as in the case of the Wesley brothers, John and Charles, many were written by one author. There was only so much Wesley information to spread out over all of their songs. It would have made more senses to collection the songs of one author together, with one essay to avoid this problem.<br /><br />\\"Then Sings My Soul\\" is aptly titled, referencing the famous lyric. It is as instructive as it is encouraging. For me, as I walked through memories new and old, I found that this coming Sunday as I sing these with my fellow parishioners, I will be singing with more soul than the Sunday before.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Then Sings My Soul: 150 of the World's Greatest Hymn Stories\\" by Robert J.

This one is focused on using it to promote business websites.<br /><br />You might not need this book. To find out, go to Google's website, and create an account. Look at the FAQs, testimonials and the help areas. Much of what's in Hill's book is logical, but is organized in as sensibly as any I have seen. I need this book for that reason. It saved me time from having to learn this information in a too slow trial-and-error way.<br /><br />You'll learn a few important things about Google, and how to help them help you attract traffic, sell products, or create interest in your website.<br /><br />AdWords<br />I have an online e-commerce site, and need to know Google. As a smaller business, I can't compete with the major companies in being listed in categories I feel are important. That's where Google AdWords comes in. It allows me, for a fee per click, to compete.<br /><br />Hill's explanation of strategies and process is solid. There are ways to lose money, and he helps show how to test keywords, use ad groups, edit ads, and how to bid intelligently. He also looks at the premium service that allows big businesses to use oogle with less worry about click-through rates.<br /><br />AdSense<br />AdSense, the tool that places Google ads on websites based on the page's content. While I only make a few cents when a vistor clicks through an ad, it helps me provide a service to my customers who do not feel my site met their needs.<br /><br />Hill explains how AdSense makes money, and warns against cheating.<br /><br />Increasing Your Page Rank<br />No one knows Google's formula for ranking pages. The most important factor is having useful information, being linked on other like-minded sites, not abusing the process.<br /><br />Hill tells you what page rank means, and how to avoid mistakes many webmasters make. This includes tips on design, domain choice, keyword use.<br /><br />Using Froogle and Google Catalogs<br />These are two features I have never used.

Isn't that the point of our enjoyment? The history and tales, and the architecture all draw us to wonder about the tall, bold and previously bright buildings. That's the approach Jones assumes throughout the book.<br /><br />Filled with color photos of both recent and old lighthouses, Jones takes us through each region of the United States. He discusses 450 lighthouses in all, presenting facts about each. We learn the year it was built and, in some instances, rebuilt. He gives us travel information as well, helping us find our way there with general directions or a location.<br /><br />This could be a primer for the average lighthouse seeker, but it is not the complete word on any of them. A book could be written on each, and we only get a few paragraphs. Most of us will be happy with that. If you need more, look at the more specialized volumes for each region or state.<br /><br />The writing is crisp and interesting, but never scholarly. It is accessible in the same way as a short encyclopedic entry would be.<br /><br />The pages are made of a stiffer glossy paper, and the dimensions of the book are awkward. It does not lay flat, and in general is hard to open. This production makes reading difficult, even though it is otherwise very attractive.<br /><br />A newer edition has since been published and should be checked out, but if the price is low, this is still an adequate choice. \\"American Lighthouses (Lighthouses)\\" by Ray Jones will help as you vacation through the US.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2005-01-29

Those taking courses on SAT test taking have an advantage, as do those plowing through Kaplan books, or those published by the Princeton Review. Skip those options, and expect a lower score than you could otherwise have received.<br /><br />What's really missing? The hardcore strategies. The College Board isn't intending to make the test easy. They want it fair, and to be an exam of true gained knowledge. While this noble desire eventually will be the real indicator of collegiate success, the point of most students for taking it isn't about potential success. It is about money, and/or acceptance to the school of their choice.<br /><br />Get into that incredible college, and continue the same effort in your courses, and the world is yours. It starts with getting accepted.<br /><br />Who Needs To Buy a Book?<br />The SAT is coming up. If you're bright, you'll do well. Doing well isn't good enough. If getting into the local state college is your goal, consider it done. Get something above a 'C' GPA, and something above 1,000 or 1,100 and you meet your goal.<br /><br />If scholarships, or acceptance at a better school are important to you, then you need to study.

Although she has avoided the stronger points of both the South Beach and the Atkins diets, she did bring in a diverse meal plan with lots of protein with minimal carbs.<br /><br />The woman described through pictures here is not a pleasant, friendly woman, but one who is terribly overweight, and who apparently eats her pets as well as bugs. Look out Fido! Look out Fluffy!<br /><br />It is the tale oft-told, and the rhymes will please the young one's ears. It is easy to remember, and so much fun that you may find yourself humming the tune. Like the classic folk story, \\"Stone Soup,\\" the song builds with each retelling. First, she eats a fly, then a spider, then a bird. You get the idea. While her plan was not to eat any of these things, she does.<br /><br />While the pictures are fun, it is the song we all love, and the one you and your family can sing on vacations, school busses.

Dyer and other authors looking to reach those who feel disenfranchised.<br /><br />Osteen's rambling, choppy speaking style comes through, written like he's campaigning for office.

Discover the power of your thoughts and words<br />4. Let go of the past<br />5. Find strength through adversity<br />6. Live to give<br />7. Choose to be happy<br /><br />The steps sound innocuous, and, outside of their religious context, are.

The verse is Psalm 119:32, \\"I run in the path of your commands, for you have set my heart free.\\"<br /><br />The anecdotes are sometimes very personal, about her fears or inadequacies. Each can be read in a few minutes, with the longest taking about fifteen minutes.<br /><br />Who should read this? It isn't heavy philosophical theology; it's accessible. I'd feel comfortable giving copies as gifts for Christmas to teens on up. Mine will end up as bathroom reading material, to encourage any visitors.<br /><br />It is like a light version of \\"My Utmost for His Highest\\" by Oswald Chambers This does not mean shallow. It is just that Marks very practically applies Christian Scripture to everyday life. There is nothing shallow about that.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"101 Amazing Things About God,\\" by Marsha Marks.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2004-10-04

Books	4	11	12	N	N	Both Sides Take Well-Deserved Humorous Heat	When I picked up \\"You Know You're a Republican/Democrat If...\\" I expected a collection of off-color, just the usual \\"I hate Bush,\\" or \\"Kerry's just a rich liberal\\" puns. I thought, given the title, the writer, like Jeff Foxworthy in his redneck series, just picked low-hanging fruit.<br /><br />It is quite witty. Some jokes are reiterations of ones heard on Leno and Letterman, redone in the \\"You know you're a\\" style, but others are current, fresh and funny.<br /><br />I tried to guess the writer's political leaning, but the jokes are well-balanced. He honestly pokes fun at whatever his side is, and thoroughly jabs the other. My hat is off to him for not revealing who will get his vote.<br /><br />Ironically, left side of each spread is a Republican joke, and the right side is a Democrat joke.<br /><br />Some of the jokes are based on simple stereotypes, like, \\"You know you're a Republican if... you think Florida election officials are fair and unbiased. You know you're a Democrat if you think 'fair Florida elections' is a contradiction in terms.\\"<br /><br />Other jokes show keen wit, and understanding of the deeper philosophical differences and inadequacies between each party and their adherents, like, \\"You know you're a Republican if you've thought about becoming a Libertarian, but have trouble with their philosophical support of prostitution, gay marriage, and uninhibited personal freedom. You know you're a Democrat if you've thought about becoming a Libertarian, but have trouble with their support of free trade.\\" Another: \\"You know you're a Republican if you prove your racial sensitivity by saying 'gracias' to your gardener. You know you're a Democrat if you're strongly committed to racial equality even if you don't personally know anyone of a different race.\\"<br /><br />Two of my favorites is, \\"You know you're a Republican if you're afraid of the IRS. You know you're a Democrat if you're afraid of the FBI,\\" and \\"You know you're a Republican if you support George W. Bush's plan to put a man on Mars. You know you're a Democrat if you want that man to be George W. Bush.\\"<br /><br />Maybe the gem in the whole book is \\"You know you're a Republican if you think Colin Powell might make a good President, if he wasn't black. You know you're a Democrat if you think Colin Powell might make a good President, if he wasn't conservative.\\"<br /><br />This is a book worth stocking in the bathroom, or for reading aloud on trips.

In fact, the Report has data, interviews, and statistics not found in the popular press.<br /><br />This isn't a book you want because of its presentation, or any dirt, like found in some expose. It is a book about what of the biggest tragedies in USA history, and its impact on our future national security. You won't find heart-wrenching images of firemen and businessmen all covered in dust, but you will read about the actions of our leaders, both wise and foolish. It is candid, alarmingly revealing, and, by default, cautioning.<br /><br />9/11 is more than what Michael Moore says, and more than what Rush Limbaugh says. Here's the report, detail by detail. No matter who wins the next election, the President and the USA in general will need to deal with the issue of terrorism. The Report outlines what they think caused it, and, more importantly, what we have been doing about it.<br /><br />I can't claim to understand the bulk of the book, or have a fully-formed opinion on what we should have done, but I can say \\"The 9/11 Commission Report\\" helps me get a better grip on all that happened.<br /><br />As a citizen, and not just as a reader, I fully recommend \\"The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States\\" by National Commission on Terrorist Attacks.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2004-10-01

He tries to help the reader understand which style(s) they respond to most, and to ask the reader to think what language the one they want to love 'hears' most clearly.<br /><br />In \\"The Five Love Languages: Five Love Languages,\\" Chapman isn't saying love only happens the way he says. Instead, he is giving a framework to love one another better. This way, we (especially we men), aren't shooting in the dark. Often, we want to love better than we do, and work hard, but miss the mark because we are, in essence, speaking another language.<br /><br />Chapman tells us that we often love the way we'd like to be loved, and that so does our spouse love us the way they'd like to be love. This can help us discover who we are, and more importantly, how we can love.<br /><br />Some romantic relationship books take the angle that men are different than women -- and that's true, but rather this a book about communications styles. In fact, he'll assert that men and women might prefer any of the five 'languages'.<br /><br />The success of this book isn't in learning the styles, but in the active use of them in our relationships. It is easy to read, but with deep consequences.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Five Love Languages: Five Love Languages\\" by Gary Chapman.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2004-10-01

In second grade, we called it a book report, but my feelings on the book haven't changed. Danny's adventure includes a visit to the ballpark, which still has me smiling. Also, like hiding an elephant, Danny discovers playing hide-and-seek with a dinosaur can be difficult.<br /><br />While the writing and drawings aren't on par with \\"Make for Ducklings,\\" or \\"Mike Milligan and the Steam Shovel,\\" it capably compares to H. A. Rey's \\"Curious George\\" series. \\"Clifford, the Big Red Dog\\" readers will connect with Danny playing with an oversized lizard.<br /><br />The text is simple, and the story is sweet, unencumbered by the intentional messaging found in many modern children's books. It is just a fun, silly story. It helped me learn to read and to love books. Maybe Danny's tale can help your son or daughter read too.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Danny and the Dinosaur\\" by Syd Hoff.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2004-09-30

The writing is not particularly funny for anyone over 12. Fans of the Stooge shorts will recognize where the captured frames were first shown.<br /><br />The limits of any Stooge print product is it misses the master delivery by Moe, Larry and Curly, and even the late-comer Stooges, Shemp, Joe ad CurlyJoe. A good thwap on the forehead isn't able to be retold in a printed picture.<br /><br />The Stooges are an American icon as much as Elvis, Snoopy and Mickey Mouse.

I learned a few things, too.<br /><br />Truss takes to task the errant punctuation found through common language. She even finds problems in Amazon.com reviews. I cannot disagree; my own reviews are littered with errors. She cites a review of Hugh Grant's movie \\"About a Boy\\". The reviewer, like so many of us, did not proofread his work, and left his shame available in review form.<br /><br />While claiming not to be about class distinction, in the British sense George Bernard Shaw meant to reduce in \\"Pygmalion,\\" she still comes across as arrogant. There is no way to avoid this poise of authoritative injunction. Punctuation is a perfect science with imperfect applications. We readers tolerate (or completely miss) errors because we understand both the message and the messenger.<br /><br />Truss' examples are humorous. Her writing is bright, with all British overtones. These overtones were resident in the original English edition, and the copy published in America is verbatim. It works to highlight the accidents of poor punctuation pervasively nicking our writing. By selectively altering a comma here and there, she shows how meaning is sometimes entirely changed. That's good to remember.<br /><br />She is clear in the beginning to say this is not a grammar book. Grammar is not punctuation, she correctly says. However, she misleads the reader into believing this is a punctuation book. It's not. It is about punctuation, with many stories, anecdotes, tales and lessons teaching proper punctuation. The book never closes in on being purely a list of 'dos and don'ts'. It is valuable for that, especially as her style welcomes the reader more than the standard reference book on the topic. She encompasses punctuation as the basis for her book, but Truss never lets the method arrest its entertainment value.<br /><br />Intelligent readers for whom the use of language matters will indubitably learn something.<br /><br />Throughout are citings of the kinds of punctuation mistakes forwarded in e-mails by editors to their friends.<br /><br />This book is a primer, at best, but completely incomplete. We are taught quickies in the usage of apostrophes, commas, colons, ellipses, semicolons, dashes and, in her estimation, the rarely used hyphen.<br /><br />Who should read \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\"? Smug freshman copyediting students and their pretentious high school counterparts, full-time professional editors who need to remember they are not alone, anyone who makes a living joining letters on a page, and junior high school English teachers who need never forget that even their best efforts will not teach every student. Most of all, as I'm confident Truss would agree, amateur book reviewers like myself should read this; we could learn the proper use of a semicolon.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation\\" by Lynne Truss. It will not replace your AP, Chicago, MLA or APA stylebooks, but it will add to your enjoyment of their much-needed use.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comare citings of the kinds of punctuation mistakes forwarded in e-mails by editors to their friends.

Many churches, he says, tell us that witnessing is more of a speech told at people. Tim Baker says it is more about a long-haul relationship in which a person intentionally share their faith, and in doing so, is more honest, loving and accurate.<br /><br />He takes standard ideas on sharing one's faith and presents them in a way that can be understood by junior high school age and above.<br /><br />With punchy language indicating he is hip to what it means to be a teenager, Baker shows he is current with what today's youth are dealing with in their Monday-Saturday lives. I wish he translate this book into something we 30-somethings can readily understand, as the ideas here are no different that will be found in any solid adult evangelism program.<br /><br />Baker's goal is to remove the barriers that teens have in sharing the gospel effectively with their friends. He honestly explains how it is easy to irritate others by being a know-it-all, how there is no need to cuss just to be connect with someone, and how tempting it is to follow those friends into parties or cults experiences and wind up in terrible trouble.<br /><br />One theme Baker keeps returning to is the teen's testimony. He explains that there is no such thing as a boring testimony, and to avoid embellishing it to make it sound more exciting. He provides several exercises for thinking through and outlining what a testimony should and shouldn't say.<br /><br />A challenge that runs through the text is to ask ourselves what stops us from sharing the Gospel, and how can we get past that. Do we need to know everything about theology? No. Does tolerance mean everyone gets into Heaven, even those who despise Christ? No. Will we be ready for every question the other person has in response? No. Will God help us? Yes.<br /><br />He gets into a chapter on what the Gospel is, and what it isn't, and the core truths we know of God. He lists several commonly heard lies about God, like \\"The earth is God,\\" and \\"There are many paths to God.\\" Similarly, he lists lies about Jesus, Heaven, sin, Satan, salvation and humans. Fans of Josh McDowell or Norman Geisler will connect with these chapters.<br /><br />When thinking of what to say to whom, he suggests the following questions, followed by why they are important to ask:<br /><br />* Who (pick someone)<br />* Are you their friend?<br />* What do they already know?<br />* What do you need to say?<br />* Before, during and after, after, after...<br /><br />These are based on being a real friend, and considering who they are before trying to tell them what you think.<br /><br />He discourages dating nonbelievers, and explains why. He makes his point while describing the pitfalls of justifying dating as an opportunity to build trust. The pretense is false and dangerous on many levels, and so Baker cautions accordingly.<br /><br />Throughout, Baker depends on Scripture. Bible verses are quoted and referenced to for every point, always bringing Christ as the focus. He writes humbly, noting his life and troubles, as well as how his faith developed. He tells the story about he was the kind of person who fell through the cracks, and was easily ignored, thanks to being dyslexic and having ADHD. Someone took the time to love him despite his mistakes, and now he is a youth pastor and author of several award-winning books.<br /><br />Unlike other books written for the teen market, Baker steers away from dropping cultural references that will be forgotten in five years. This book should have staying power for a few more years than some others.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Witnessing 101\\" by Tim Baker. Students can use this in a weekly meeting, or on their own. Not only will they learn what sharing their faith means and how to do it, but they will also gain insight about living a life that's true.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.commany paths to God.\\" Similarly, he lists lies about Jesus, Heaven, sin, Satan, salvation and humans.

Always a fine collection of publishers of Christian poetry, prose and nonfiction, this year's edition adds some new features and loads of new content. As with each edition, this book continues to reign as the best resource for those writers wanting to publish Christian material.<br /><br />Possibly because of the popularity of \\"The Passion of the Christ,\\" the \\"Left Behind\\" series, or the religious titles showing up in the New York Times Bestseller List, or even because of the new age spirituality and occasionally Christian viewpoint of  PAX-TV, publishers are recognizing that there is a market beyond the usual secular fare. Christian fiction has grown and broadened, and the quality has returned to the level of C. S. Lewis and Gerard Manley Hopkins. Stuart has been able to add over 100 publishers and periodicals as a result.<br /><br />As the quality of Christian publishing grows, so does the sophistication of acquisition. Stuart provides agents and other kinds of manuscript screening services. In the case of major publishers, an agent is the only way in. Shaw Books, publisher of \\"Christian Writers' Market Guide,\\" will accept queries only. Unsolicited manuscripts must be submitted through a third party, The Writer's Edge, a service used by many others including \\"Left Behind's\\" Tyndale House Publishers.<br /><br />Each entry includes, as appropriate, the name of the publisher, the contact information, a URL, the editor and his or her title, a description of focus, number of titles published, how many titles from new authors asre published each year, how quickly they publish chosen material, whether or not they accept simultaneous submissions, how quickly they respond to submissions, how to acquire guidelines, and a decsription of their current needs.<br /><br />Although many of the entries tend to lean toward Protestant thinking, Catholic publications are also listed, like \\"St. Anthony's Messenger,\\" the \\"Liguorian,\\" and \\"Catholic Digest.\\"<br /><br />The list of websites has increased. Since many of the publications are denominational or have small print runs, finding print copies may be difficult. Checking the publisher's website not only will allow a look at the tone, but also provide writer's guidelines.<br /><br />One feature worth mentioning is the dollar ($) sign. Are you looking to make a few bucks? Then look for that symbol before the listing. Not everyone pays, but many do. Likewise, an (s) in front of the publisher indicates it is a subsidy or POD (print on demand) publisher. These kinds of tools help speed up the process of sorting through the hundreds (over 1,000) markets.<br /><br />Included once again is the remarkably thorough \\"Topical Book Listings,\\" useful, for example, the writer looking to submit an article on forgiveness or on an aspect of liturgical studies. Topics includes where to send photographs, poetry, pastoral and leadership articles, ethnic and multicultural pieces, and historical romances.<br /><br />Without this book, I never would have submitted my poetry to \\"Decision Magazine,\\" which has purchased several poems. I also would never have learned about the vast number of other publishers which might be interested in my short fiction.<br /><br />Still lacking in this otherwise terrific resource is a digital version.

He was a great writer and cartoonist before his famous cat's striped hat became chic fashion among post-grunge era teenagers.<br /><br />In \\"The Seuss, the Whole Seuss and Nothing But the Seuss: A Visual Biography of Theodor Seuss Geisel\\" by Charles Cohen, we are shown the greatness of Seuss -- of Theodor Geisel, through drawings, paintings and text. We get to learn about his early days at Dartmouth, as he toyed with hybridic animals, wit and satire.<br /><br />Not every idea worked. Seuss, an experimenter, evolved from being a talented but rustic styler of odd creatures into a sophisticated artist of odd, if not bizarre beasts that had genuine identity.<br /><br />Before he write and drew books about green eggs, grinches, and elephants named Horton, he was an editorial cartoonist. His language in many of the cartoons was far from being politically correct, but his social commentary decrying racism was right on. He hard-handed racist thought with no evidence of his sweet children's characters kindness.<br /><br />Cohen has produced an array of research. Samples of Seuss' art grace most pages. We also get a look at the vast merchandising, parodies, and unlicensed knock-offs.<br /><br />This is not a children's book. Don't be fooled by the name of the publisher.

I am not referring to the chess books Fischer wrote, as those are guidelines to chess perfection. This refers to any discussion of his life, which this book does. The world's greatest chess player, Fischer, has lived his personal life much less logically than his life is an eight by eight square cell.<br /><br />To help the nonchess reader sort out the menagerie, authors David Edmonds and John Eidinow provide a \\"Dramatis Personae,\\" listing 21 Americans, 24 Soviets, six Icelanders, four match officials, and six sundry others, explaining their relationship to the Reykjavik, Iceland chess match. They also include a short glossary to educate us in the vocabulary of competitive chess.<br /><br />The book begins with a vital quote by Boris Spassky, \\"When you play Bobby, it is not a question of whether you win or lose. It is a question of whether you survive. This sets the tone for all that follows.<br /><br />Edmonds and Eidinow lay out the social mire Fischer was growing up in, and his quick rise to chess dominance.<br /><br />In 1954, when Fischer was 11, he was attending matches and doing well enough but not at his later prodigy level. In that year, as he is quoted, he \\"just got good.\\" Modern chess history, or at least for one its most colorful characters, begins then.<br /><br />1972: Boris Spassky was the champ. He deserved to be there. Bobby Fischer was the contender. He deserved to have the opportunity. Between these two men stood a world of complex politics, money, national pride, idiosyncrasies, and suitors to the game. Reykjavik, Iceland was the location of what has become one of the most legendary chess matches ever, between Spassky and Fischer.<br /><br />Early on during Fischer's career, he had the same impact Michael Jordan would later enjoy later enjoy as professional basketball player. \\"Fischer-fear\\" was the description of some players' psychosomatic illnesses from Fischer's intimidation. Opponents would make mistakes as a result. Fischer had the bravado of Muhammad Ali, but none of his class. He would take this personality and boorish demands to the match.<br /><br />Boris Spassky is painted differently. A product of the Soviet support system, he became professional about the game. Affable and popular, an opposite to in every way to Fischer, he still had what Fischer lacked -- the title \\"World Champion.\\"<br /><br />The bulk of the book moves on from biography and personality profiles. It follows the path the chess culture -- all chaotic in its apparent systemic approach. Going from the need to compete to the actual match turned through every convoluted corner, with Kissinger's involvement, the FBI, the KGB, and as much intrigue as a James Bond movie.<br /><br />The travails of the match are outlined as needed (but not heavily), highlighting the most interesting parts and never boring nonchess players. The psychology of the players and chess players in general is discussed, as is the history of modern champions, providing a field for tension and a framework for the match.<br /><br />This was in the midst of the Cold War, and the Soviets -- not just Spassky, owned the chess champ title. Nixon was president. Fischer, the bombastic, arrogant American who hated Russia, had a knack for successfully risking it all on the board by knowing the principles of chess as a sublime art form. Spassky, the methodical Russian, against Fischer, became a symbol of the Cold war itself. The image of the match was only half of the matter. Neither man was the caricature the press saw them as, but such are the stories of legend.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match of All Time,\\" by David Edmonds and John Eidinow. Oh, and if you somehow missed the big news back in 1972, Fischer won the match.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2004-03-20

Unlike \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" Steinbeck brings us swiftly into each moment, never letting us linger too long before walking us to the next place.<br /><br />The American Dream has many variations, but always, it is about independence and the pride of being one's own man. Lennie and George want this independence more than most men, but have less than most men to get there. In their case, it isn't a white picket fence, but a farm where they can raise rabbits.<br /><br />Lennie is not a bright man. He desires to care for someone and to be loved, but is unable to think past his own fear. George tries to protect him, but he too, although smarter than Lennie, is managed by his insecurity and foolishness.<br /><br />The story surrounds Lennie and George's efforts to get and retain work on ranch near Soledad, and more so, toward their American Dream. The big picture is always with them, but it is the day-by-day difficulties they have with being outsiders. Their intrinsic inability to be free is sheer tragedy, as they both fail again and again to make the right decision.<br /><br />It's a lonely story about two men who hope more than they can think, who are destined by their misery never to enjoy true companionship and happiness.<br /><br />Few books are as thematically pure as \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" which follows Man's search for self and meaning carefully. It is harsh in language and image, and the abstract ideas might be too much for younger readers to comprehend, but any intelligent teen will gain from it where John Knowles' \\"A Separate Peace\\" and J.D.

Women are women. Right? The matter of gender is easy enough to establish, but in Lois P. Frankel's book, \\"Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office: 101 Unconscious Mistakes Women Make That Sabotage Their Careers\\" we learn there are underlying mores and premises to follow if women want to be at the top of a company. These rules are unspoken, but Frankel demystifies the process by which some women hurt their success by playing into the cultural roles prescribed to them growing up.<br /><br />Frankel presumes most women grew up in a home that oppresses women from growing up into full adults. What may have been true for 1954 is not as true today. However, her challenge is still with merit, and in 2004, it crosses the gender barrier. e men should be taking notes from Frankel. There are plenty of little boys among us who need to work as men.<br /><br />\\"Rosie the Riveter\\" ads during WWII encouraged women into the workplace, but often as factory and shipyard works. There was no \\"Annie the Accountant\\" or \\"Sally the CEO\\" campaigns. Being all you can be means being more than you were as a child. Frankel helps show how women can be more than little girls in the office place, and garner success as a result.<br /><br />It is important to note that as much as this is an important book for women who esteem to be seen as professional should read, men also should read it. Not every man has reached his potential, and some fall to the same problems, in a masculine variation, as do some women. Fear, exhibited through the lack of initiative and an overborne, unnecessary kindness, holds many people back.<br /><br />Objective, straightforwardness is much of what Frankel asserts.<br /><br />Being professional doesn't mean you need to convert into a stomping intimidator, but it does mean being firm, not wincing when rejection is forthcoming, and thinking about more than immediate relationships. It is about getting the job done well, in concert with others, but never becoming weak while doing it all. You have expertise. You have training. You have what it takes.<br /><br />Although Frankel is a professional coach, her book itself shows a coach is not needed. You need to be in control of your career, without worrying about the next person. Retain your ethics, your integrity and your aplomb, but it is your job to lead the way through your professional life. No parents, no coach, no friends are responsible for this.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office: 101 Unconscious Mistakes Women Make That Sabotage Their Careers\\"<br />by Lois P.

Why \\"Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People\\"? What does Stephen Covey have to say that differs from Spencer Johnson, Phil McGraw and John Gray?<br /><br />In some cases, what Covey says they all say. The biggest difference is the process, not the method. Covey's \\"Seven Habits\\" are like eating properly during the gestation of your baby. The short-term results are hard to realize, but the foundation for good health are laid. Follow what Covey says, and in the long-term, you will be highly effective.<br /><br />Covey starts with explaining that the first step isn't external, but internal. It isn't just that Covey is trying to get you to feel good about your abilities. Instead, he wants you prepared for the hard work the seven habits will require. In fact, Covey deplores the cheap 'character ethic' method, noting it evolved away from character, and more into quick-fix influence techniques.<br /><br />He separates influence and character, and wants the reader to know influence without character is not good. \\"Only basic goodness gives life to technique.\\" The book is not a lesson in technique.<br /><br />The Seven Habits are divided into chapters:<br />1- Be Proactive<br />2- Begin with the End in Mind<br />3- Put First Things First<br />4- Think Win/Win<br />5- Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood<br />6- Synergize<br />7- Sharpen the Saw<br /><br />Covey, despite how it is a management and professional growth book, has also written a personal growth book. It is not a relationship book, as in the sense John Gray writes, or a weight loss book, like Dr. Phil writes. Fans of \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" by Johnson will connect. Though Covey won't charge at the reader by asking him to repeat a mantra of \\"I think I can. I think I can,\\" he does show the reader the ways of realigning their perspective, their goals and their strengths for the greater good of both the reader, and those he interacts with.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People\\" by Stephen R.

Blyth is as erudite and savvy as the women she is verbally savaging. This gives her authority, wisdom, and inside knowledge. Her bias isn't hidden, and neither are the merits of her argument.<br /><br />In 2001, Bernard Goldberg's \\"Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News\\" was published and was lambasted by his media colleagues. Now, with a similar tone and message, Blyth will be find speaking counter culturally will anger her former peers. Blyth, unaffected, has boldly let in the light into what is to most of us a shuttered world.<br /><br />Her precise point, that those women buying women's magazines have different, more conservative values than those editing and publishing them, is logical and long known. Where Blyth steps in is to provide anecdotes and examples, having been part of the value divide. She's portrayed as a whistle-blower, but the real story is that she's not a cubical warrior. She ran the show, picked the editors, stories and angles. Her culpability is deeper than the average unknown whistle-blower.<br /><br />It is as much of a political book as it is a media analysis text, but it reads more like an expose. That Blyth has a conservative tack in her book isn't subtle. The trouble is not her tone, but in her facts. She cites circumstances how alarmism littered the editorial choices, while feminism is peddled to women oppressed in their own ignorance of what feminism is and isn't.<br /><br />Dividing the hyped up prose from the truth won't be hard for readers.

I saw the movie before reading this book. Having seen the movie, I find objectivity impossible.<br /><br />Frank Abagnale tells of his adventures living the life of James Bond without the killing, using his wits and charm to get what he wants. It is romanticized, but plausible.<br /><br />Do I advise you to read the book first so as to avoid the skew of injecting Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio? You know the successful movie. It is hard not to hear DiCaprio's voice while reading Frank's dialogue. Because the movie has such skilled actors and good editing, it comes across tightly and exciting.<br /><br />Do I instead advise you to watch the movie first because it will be easier to imagine the details of check fraud production? The book is not well-edited, and suffers from mediocre writing, and any help moving it along will help.<br /><br />The book is less fun than the movie. There is much more to absorb, more details to consider, and more of Abagnale in the story. His ego plays heavily into the text, and this gets old. His story does not end with this book, but additional chapters haven't been included.<br /><br />How true is it all? Who can say? Some of it is verifiable, but Abagnale was, in many cases, the only one there. He fabricated so much of his existence, knowing when it is the truth and when it is storytelling is impossible. To enjoy the book, the reader must take the author at his word.<br /><br />The parental drive Frank wants from Carl feels less evident, missing the sensitive looks and words as played in the movie by Hanks and DiCaprio.<br /><br />In reading other 'how I lived as a criminal' books by cons like Jack 'Murph the Surf' Murphy, I have had to remember writing skill isn't why they are authors. It is proficiency in thievery, conning, or some other great misdeed. The movie fooled me into believing this book would be different. However, just like Murphy, Abagnale is a man whose life is redeemed. The book doesn't cover this.<br /><br />There is something oddly heroic about a guy who has managed to fool a lot of people just by pretending. While applauding Abagnale's crimes are wrong, his ingenuity is amazing. He was good enough for the government to cut a deal with him. That's Tom Sawyer with more pluck and style. We wish were that smart and suave. This creates morality layers, but a book worth reading and thinking about.<br /><br />Read \\"Catch Me If You Can,\\" then see the movie.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comto fool a lot of people just by pretending.

Like the human characters on Sesame Street, he was a real person. We related to him as if he lived next door. He spent his career asking us not only to be our neighbor, but also to love our neighbor as ourselves. He continues that great message here.<br /><br />In \\"The World According to Mister Rogers,\\" we are treated to his quotes and sayings, and lyrics of his songs. Like Robert Fulghum's famous book about what he learned in kindergarten, Rogers' book could be considered those lessons in their original form. With an audience that is very young, his messages had to be concise. They are as succinct here, and usually only a few lines long. This makes Rogers' the master, and Fulghum the follower, and it shows.<br /><br />Your young son or daughter won't read this, you will. When you do, you'll be reminded of some great values and ideals you will want to teach them. Sure, Mister Rogers repeats his ideas throughout the book, but there is something to be said about saying the right thing often.<br /><br />As a long winter read, try Tolstoy, but for an entertaining yet pithy collection of reflections worth knowing, \\"The World According to Mister Rogers\\" is the book to buy.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2004-01-08

I asked for a recipe for cooking quail, and the butcher handed me this book. He said it was all I needed, and he was right.<br /><br />Whether you want to cook raccoon, rabbit, fish, venison, or any kind of fowl, Rywell has creatively written recipes that an average person can make. It includes general instructions for field dressing. The recipes are standards, with none being overly exotic to any domestic hunter. From this cookbook, I have made many delicious wild game dinners, including venison roasts, bobwhite quail, and pheasant breast. His directions are clear, and his ingredients are easy to find at any local grocer.<br /><br />You will enjoy the recipe for cooking an elephant. I can't comment on whether or not it works, but he tells it well. There are a few other entertaining recipes, including one written in a regional, backwoods dialect.<br /><br />There are only 70+ black and white pages but they are filled with recipes. This is not a coffee table cookbook decorated with pictures of spices or plated dishes. Mostly, Rywell is all business, providing a neatly packed collection of tasty recipes.<br /><br />If you hunt, are the spouse of a hunter, have friends who hunt, or happen to live near a specialty butcher, then buy a copy of \\"Wild Game Cookbook\\" by Martin Rywell.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2004-01-08

Part of the problem was in trying to stay as close to Tolkien's own version while bringing plausible life to Shelob that would work in a movie.<br /><br />Some of the pictures are pencils. Others are full-color, finely detailed views. Various angles are provided as in the many scenes of Mordor. There are photos of early models, both colored and plain, giving a 3D perspective of what the artists were thinking.<br /><br />The insight here will intrigue nonartists like myself who are amazed at how complex the making of LOTR was, and serve as a primer for character and building studies.

Dent, however, can't help but to provide the background of Nagurski's early life.<br /><br />Bronko Nagurski was the Babe Ruth of football. No one was greater, more dominant, more powerful at their sport than Nagurski. Others have played well: We all know about Michael Jordan, Mickey Mantle, and Lance Armstrong, but few have embodied the essence of their sport with such successful excellence. I should mention Muhammad Ali. He often bragged he was the greatest, and he was.<br /><br />Someone needs to make a movie of this story. Bronko began the Hollywood/Horatio Alger as a hardworking, not too complicated  future football hero. He had heart and the physical strength size to back it up. Good true football movies are sparse. There's \\"Rudy\\" and \\"Brian's Song,\\" but that's it. A Bronko Nagurski story could add to this short list.<br /><br />Most of the book reads like a docudrama, utilizing storytelling techniques rarely found in sports books.<br /><br />If I were a high school football coach, I would have my players read this book. Bronko Nagurski played the game before the lights shone brightly on the pocketbooks, when the swagger and dance of endzone celebrations were still years away, and the game was still played by big, tough men not pretty enough for white-toothed smiling products endorsements.

Her pithy, biblical, and friendly book is as approachable as an old friend in a coffee shop. Reading each 'lesson' is like poking in on a conversation, and her manner of writing asks the reader into the discussion.<br /><br />Each short chapter relates a truth. Some are brief, being only a sentence long. Others are a few pages.<br /><br />There are personal, anecdotal chapters, like \\"The Lost Child\\" which relates a stream of panic while looking for her young daughter. Marks thought she was kidnapped, when, in reality, she was trying to take a shower. The lesson here? With an experience like this, Marks now knows more about what God must have felt when He saw His children were lost from Him and needed a savior.<br /><br />Some are directly practical, like in \\"Ten Things to Look for in a Husband.\\" She lists ten features a woman should look for in a potential mate, like patience, outside interests, and gentleness. She cites how her own husband meets these criteria.<br /><br />Some are succinct. \\"Inside Image\\" says, \\"What you put into your heart, mind, and soul will determine the image that is reflected out.\\" That's it. You've just read the entire chapter.<br /><br />Filtered throughout are biblical passages connected with many of the chapters.<br /><br />As warm as her writing is, Marks never waters down her belief that ultimately, God is the answer to all of life's troubles. She is never preachy, but stands firm that the truth of God will set you free.<br /><br />Whether you enjoyed \\"Prayer of Jabez\\" or the \\"Chicken Soup\\" series, or \\"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten,\\" be assured that you will find \\"101 Simple Lessons for Life\\" as a fine follow-up.

No one will find themselves offended by the religious statements; they are innocuous.<br /><br />The ideas and discussion are great: Ironclad budgets, how to study, lifestyle organization, communication tips, anger management, understanding impulsivity, and children. It's strength is in communicating that there are solutions and processes for a successful marriage despite ADD.<br /><br />Filled with anecdotes, a spouse might sigh in relief, recognizing that his or her problems are not unique, and that these issues are not just within their marriage, but occur commonly in an ADD/non-ADD marriage. These vignettes can bring hope to a harried reader.<br /><br />Where the book is weakest is when the writing becomes cliche and cute, and begins to sound like a seminar. All the chapters begin with 'ADD---' as in 'ADDmitting Anger' and 'ADDvancing Through School'. If you've ever read any literature on ADD, you've heard this and the tales of the distracted, goofy husband. Taking the book seriously when it doesn't is not easy, and it takes away from the good sense the writers describe throughout.<br /><br />For the reader looking to learn about ADD for the first time, this isn't your book. Read \\"Driven to Distraction\\" first, and then come to this one. It isn't too deep so much as it helps to have more grounding in what ADD is.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Honey Are You Listening?\\" by Rick and Jerilyn Fowler. As the spouse understands ADD more, it will help love and a loving marriage flourish. The ADD spouse will feel more support and strength, and a little less alone.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com.

If I wanted to learn how to cook Hungarian dishes (and I do), I would use this book. Everything about it is practical. This is no coffee table decoration filled with pictures of quaint cafes on the Duna, but something as useful as the Betty Crocker, and Better Homes and Garden cookbooks.<br /><br />Derecskey starts the reader off with a quick explanation of the techniques and ingredients peculiar to a Hungarian meal. Equipment, she says, like pots and pans, are standard. None of the ingredients are unusual or hard to find. The Hungarians especially love to use bacon, bread crumbs, butter, caraway seeds, cooking fat, onions, sausage, sour cream and tomatoes. You already know about paprika.<br /><br />There is a short introductory, but helpful chapter on wines, naming and describing ten major Hungarian wine types.<br /><br />Each chapter presents the expected categories, like fish, poultry and pork. She gives us the Hungarian translation for each food type, and for each recipe as well.<br /><br />The recipes themselves are nicely described. Since the book is void of pictures of prepared dishes (the only crucial drawback), she relies on a strong prose style. That is often missing from other international cookbooks filled with poetic takes on the romance of the local culture. Never self-indulgent, Derecskey is personal, comfortably providing her preferences for spicing quantity and serving styles.<br /><br />This isn't a gourmet book. The recipes here produce the foods being made in modern Hungarian homes. The author refers frequently to relatives who gave her insight for some of the more difficult dishes. Clearly written for American tastes and cooking styles, it may disappoint some cooks. Those looking for a more authentic but slightly gourmet taste should look for Chef Gundel's cookbook, based on his famous restaurant menu.<br /><br />She gives us enough cultural discussion to keep the book from being bland, while never losing focus for why we purchased the book -- to learn how to make specific Hungarian dishes.<br /><br />Finally, right after the chapter, \\"Desserts and Cakes\\" (&Eacute;dess&eacute;gek &eacute;s Tort&aacute;k), there is a handy state-by-state shopping guide with 56 butchers, delicatessens and import stores.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Hungarian Cookbook.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comed the book -- to learn how to make specific Hungarian dishes.

Located 25 miles west of Chicago in the midst of suburbia, DuPage County might not be where great hiking is expected, but Jim Hochgesang shows otherwise.<br /><br />Hochgesang outlines the best features and reach of the Illinois Prairie Path, a 55+ mile network of almost paved paths within the forest preserves. It has the kind of information you'd find in pamphlets. The differences are that he writes well and it is all in one book. No need with to fumble through a satchel of flyers when you've got this book.<br /><br />The IPP is a biker's dream, and many people use it to commute, circumventing traffic and enjoying the gorgeous northern Illinois outdoors. The forks and branches can take a traveler through some beautiful scenery and within blocks of most important western suburban locales.<br /><br />He details the history of the paths, and the landmarks worth seeing. He gives us the gray tree frog in Waterfall Glen, Graue Mill at Fullersburg Woods, and Salt Creek in the Northeast Forest Preserve. He takes mile-by-mile down wooded lanes, and tells us the mileage for each link of the route.<br /><br />A special chapter is devoted to the verdant Morton Arboretum, a treasure located in Lisle, Ill.<br /><br />It needs an update, but the maps are still accurate. Many areas have seen changes, including the Arboretum, whose entrance area underwent a significant overhaul in the summer of 2003.<br /><br />I have used it successfully to plan long bike trips and runs. If you run or bike, or like a leisurely autumn walk, and are thinking of finding out what DuPage offers, buy this book.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2003-09-29

Its charm is not in how up to date it is -- it isn't -- but in the way it captures the personality of major names in marathoning. Waitz, Beardsley, Zatopek, Shorter and Bikila are all profiled, complete with photos from their glory days.<br /><br />The struggle of the distance is described in both word and picture. Grete Waitz, the great Norwegian runner, shows strength at the finish line, while Abebe Bikila, the bare-footed Ethiopian who won the 1960 Rome Olympic Marathon, is seen focused. There are 13 runners in all, separated into chapters by name.<br /><br />Each profile provides a history of marathoning, and talks about the context that runner raced in. For Spirodon Louis (he won the first Olympic marathon in 1986), we learn about Pheidippides, the first marathoner. It was Pheidippides who delivered news of a Greek war victory in 490 BC, running from Marathon to Athens.<br /><br />I fully recommend this book to any young runner who wants to get an overview of the individuals within the grand mass of runners. It is inspiring and fun.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2003-09-23

He dedicated the last years of his life promoting and educating Christians about this spiritual discpline. His experience, along with his expertise in Christian outreach and discipleship, augments the research behind this book.<br /><br />Though written from an evangelical Christian point of view, Catholics and other liturgical faiths might find this book helpful during the Lenten season.<br /><br />Discussed here are the reasons to pray, and what part fasting has in prayer, the Great Commission, and revival. Bright addresses corporate fasting as well as individual fasting. How should a church initiate a fast? He also mentions other resources through each chapter for further reading.<br /><br />One chapter of interest to me is on the physical aspects of fasting. The difference between a juice fast and water-only fast are looked at, emphasizing the medical necessities. He points out that not all juices are the same, and encourages avoiding the heavily sugared (corn syrup, etc.) juices, and to temper acidic juices like orange juice with 50% water.<br /><br />This is a wise and practical first look into fasting. It isn't a small group study, but can be a tool within a small group as members learn to pray.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Transforming Power of Fasting and Prayer\\" by Bill Bright. For a continued look at fasting with a more contemplative approach, see Richard J.

You might be going on your first trip and want to know how to approach the whole matter.<br /><br />\\"The Essential Guide to the Short Term Mission Trip\\" by David C. Forward explains with examples the sorts of things which those in missions leadership at a church should be thinking about.<br /><br />The points made in this book could avert disasters. What good is spending a lot of money to go overseas only to find you've no idea what you've got yourself into? While it is true that having a flexible personality is key to any missions effort, it is also a good idea to prepare when possible.<br /><br />Some readers may cringe at the strategic sensibility of David Forward. \\"The Essential Guide to the Short Term Mission Trip\\" is all about practical thinking. St. Paul prepared practically for his trips. He knew where he was going, how long it would take, and how much food to being along. Forward helps think like Paul.<br /><br />Noting that many going on the trip may be first time short-termers, or first time airplane riders, he discusses travel tips. For example, bring a spare pair of glasses, remember to bring a list of people you intend to write (Like your supporters), and how to deal with lost luggage. He even outlines how to run a team meeting, with suggestions for topics.<br /><br />He spends time on the complex matter of money, and how support should be raised, and what a church's financial involvement should be. He is not dogmatic, but points out the pro's and con's of the various positions.<br /><br />Forward's missions experience has taken him primarily from Britain to Romania, with stopovers in Budapest. He cites from this experiences fluently, and helps the reader see how the essentials in this guide can be applied. He gives anecdotes about cultural sensitivity, like how in Romania, the real Dracula is considered a national hero for reasons other than what Bram Stoker's novel talks about. Jokes, Forward writes, about the morbid side of Dracula are unappreciated by locals.<br /><br />The appendices are useful, helping the reader think through the incidentals. Some things, like having calling card codes and travel insurance numbers with you, should not be overlooked.<br /><br />I fully recommend this excellent tool for preparing a team for short-term missions.

Early Hungarian literature was not recorded, and so their mythology is difficult to pinpoint. Unlike the Greeks, and even the North American Indianns are abound in material to draw from, but Hungarian mythology is fragmented.<br /><br />This isn't an anthology, but a connecting of the dots, how similar Hungarian mythology is to Finnish and others, but also how the archetypes of story are just as present as they are in other cultures. It is a mixture of folklore, liguistics and anthropolgy, with occasional looks at psychoanalysis.<br /><br />Roheim cites as he can from the myths. He explains the symbols, themes and origins. His research is multilingual, as seen in his bibliography. German, Finnish, Hungarian and English sources are listed.<br /><br />An excellent feature is his appendices of Uralic, Atltaic, and Paleo-Siberuian Peoples and Languages; The Hungarian Chronicles [discusses four early historical texts]; and Ugric Ethnic Names. These each shed light on Roheim's thesis, and<br /><br />There are a few good texts out there reviewing and analyzing Hungarian literature after 1600, but few take on the task Roheim has.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Hungarian and Vogul Mythology (American Ethnological Society Monographs, No 23)\\" by Geza Roheim.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2003-07-12

In \\"Land of the Pharaohs,\\" young hero Toby Digz, a skateboard riding archeologist, goes from adventure to adventure as he and his pals learn about the biblical Exodus.<br /><br />Teaching science, archeology, friendship and faith in a natural, Indiana Jones-like style, David Hernandez uses solid storytelling techniques to entertain while educating readers.<br /><br />Among the strengths of the book are the vocabulary and sentence structure. Hernandez recognizes his audience is young, but he doesn't write down to them. \\"Toby spun around with his flashlight to see the old coffins swinging open and crumbling mummies falling toward them.\\" Though some of the vocabulary might be challenging, that's OK -- a dictionary of 12 words is in the back (so parents will know what's going on).<br /><br />I enjoyed the flip animation. Toby climbs a rope. Fun!<br /><br />The art reminds me of Scooby Doo cartoons. That's OK. The story will appeal to Scooby fans. It is clear that the creators of this series were aiming this way, as each character is like the Scooby foursome, and they've even got a dog which gets into mischief.<br /><br />One downfall regarding the art: it mixes standard illustration with Photoshop-flavored textures and other effects. The contrast isn't pleasant. In some cases, it appears as if the illustration was pasted atop the background. Another disappointing feature is that on a few pages, the text is over a dark area of the page, and it is not easy to read.<br /><br />The art problems are tolerable, and the writing is top-notch.

By the nature of the book, there is an educated obscurity to most of the terms. \\"The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms\\" conquers this by displacing the less useful words with very readable definitions of the words the book lists.<br /><br />For example, 'plurisignation,' a somewhat difficult word to say, sends the reader, sans definition, to 'ambiguity,' which enjoys a more sensible, approachable definition.<br /><br />Finishing the book is 'zeugma,' which Baldick describes as a figure of speech \\"by which one word refers to two others in the same sentence.\\" He gives us a taste of William Shakespeare in a sample of a zeugma, \\"Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.\\"<br /><br />It is adequately cross-referenced, and is accessible for browsing without becoming lost in heady terms.<br /><br />Who should read this? Any college freshman studying literature. This is a solid handbook, and is begging to be used in classrooms, taught letter-by-letter, entry-by-entry.

Studs Terkel, in \\"Division Street: America,\\" gives us the names of those people on whom those big shoulders rest. Like Edgar Lee Masters' collection of poetic epitaphs, \\"Spoon River Anthology,\\" Terkel titles each chapter with the name of those whose lives are being described.<br /><br />Division Street runs East-West through Chicago, ending at Lake Shore Drive. It is a major road, and Terkel could've chosen any avenue to name his book. What is important is that it cuts through the center of the city, and, symbolically, into and through the heart of it all.<br /><br />Each story is a page or two. Some are five or six pages. None are too long. Terkel knows when to finish the story. However, to call the short chapters 'stories' isn't really accurate. They are edited conversations with people you might have known if you lived in Chicago in 1967 when this was first published. Some of the people are cops. Others are teachers, cabbies and nuns. There is even a couple CEOs and advertising guys. Terkel manages to connect with each interviewee, and allow them to do the talking.<br /><br />Everything you've heard about Studs Terkel or this book is true. It is fantastically voyeuristic, and terrifically revealing without ever being cheap or exploitive. These people are so familiar, as if you overheard Terkel chatting with them at a diner or coffeehouse.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend \\"Division Street: America\\" by Studs Terkel.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2003-05-30

As I'm considering a lengthy trip to Arizona, and to Phoenix specifically, I want to know the what's what on the what-to-see. \\"The Best of Phoenix and Tucson: The Ten Best\\" has that, with a hearty dash of personality.<br /><br />Lots of travel guides take a similar tack: list the top ten of the usual categories. What makes this one different is that the writers have avoided becoming lackeys to the hotel of entertainment industry. Instead of being crammed with corporate logos, they focus on their opinion. I like that.<br /><br />No one will be surprised to read most of the lists: dining, resorts, romantic vistas, but nice to see were lists like, \\"The Ten Best Other Ethnic Restaurants.\\" Naturally, they have a number of general and Hispanic restaurant lists, but I was pleased to see the authors really did their homework. Now I know I can check out \\"Peter's European Cafe\\" and taste their Hungarian palacsintas (stuffed crepes).<br /><br />Phoenix and Tucson are neighbors. Anyone visiting one community is likely to visit the other, but they are not twin cities. Therefore, the writers wisely create separate sections for each city. Anyone willing to make the 110 mile drive will be ready.<br /><br />A tourist will love this book, but I suspect any local will discover things about his home city previously hidden deep in the phone book.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Best of Phoenix and Tucson: The Ten Best\\" by Don W.

I went into this book, realizing my bias against the heavily marketed Thomas Kinkade art I see in the malls and on every possible item, especially ones with a Christian bent. By the time I was done reading through \\"My Childhood Memories,\\" I found myself buying into the pictures. They are perfect for this context.<br /><br />The Currier and Ives tone bores me. Still, kids are thrilled with this, and so, my bias takes a back seat. I asked around, and showed it to a few neighbor children. They loved the book. They aren't as jaded as I am, and find Kinkade's ability to consistently paint postcard pictures with the same rich colors and subtleties that show a child what art can be.<br /><br />With a Norman Rockwell sensibility, minus the people, Kinkade illuminates each scene with details that will remind every child of a clean and cultured worldview. These images show slices of life within this gorgeous journal.<br /><br />Although the Kinkade pictures dominate the book (over 40 of them), there are quotes on almost every spread. Vincent Van Gogh, Gelett Burgess, Janusz Korczak are all quoted. Scripture verses, though, are the primary source of quotes, all short enough to be read and remembered.<br /><br />This journal asks questions. Unlike the very contemporary girls \\"Piece of My Mind Devotionals\\" journal series by Linda Washington, \\"My Childhood Memories\\" straightforwardly asks the young reader to fill in thoughtful scrapbook-type information. From \\"The thing I love about my grandfather...\\" to \\"I believe that angels...\\" to relating anecdotes about parents, this book will be something to be looked back through for years. There are places to affix photos, and places to list things and tell stories.<br /><br />I recommend this for parents (especially homeschoolers) looking to encourage writing while collecting memories. It will reinforce the family life, introduce Scripture, and forge a bond between childhood and growing older as the child reflects back on the book as he or she grows older.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comgrows older.

I discovered this when I was six at a lake in southwestern Michigan when I brought home an unexpected new pet from a duck pond. \\"Frogs: A Wildlife Handbook\\" is a great guide for moms and dads to help sort through what Junior brings home from his adventures.<br /><br />This handbook provides the Latin name, a description, habitat, size and vocal call of each listed frog. There's a watercolor illustration of the frog, and a map of what range that frog has. You can know for sure if your find is truly a leopard frog.<br /><br />More than a mere species descriptor, we read about the anatomy of frog types. Excellent diagrams of their skeletal structure, of how their tongues grab insects in mid-air, and of a tadpole metamorphosis are all highlights.<br /><br />Predators and disease have their own chapters, and are worth reading. This helps put science (for nonscientists) behind the news about environmental concerns, as well as direct landowners through what's going on in their ponds.<br /><br />On the fun side, we get a list of other languages' terms for 'frog'. In Hungary, you'll learn it is 'b&eacute;ka,' in Gaelic, 'losgann,' and in Hmong, a frog is called 'hma'.<br /><br />I've read dozens of frog books for grown-ups and children, and am pleased to have read this one. While a six year-old might be overwhelmed with this one, he'll enjoy the pictures and grow into it.

Despite the flashy title and cool cover, reading about two rich businessmen fighting for the control of a publishing company might not seem all that exciting.<br /><br />It is exciting.<br /><br />Like in any theatrical drama, Raviv begins his book with an annotated list of players. Most names will be unknowns outside of the industry. Stan Lee is here, as you might expect, but so is Isaac Perlmutter and numerous lesser executives. Their parts in this drama are crucial and understanding who they are from the beginning will help keep the plot clear.<br /><br />This is, in some ways, a history of Marvel Comics, beginning in 1939 with Captain America, the Sub-Mariner and the Human Torch. Raviv walks us through Marvel's troubled times under various owners.<br /><br />We get the play-by-play debacle hindering the X-Men and Spiderman from the silver screen, and the intense personalities behind it all.<br /><br />The cynicism of loyal comic readers is told, as Marvel aimed for the financial speculator and played games with collectors (remember the many covers and bags of certain Spiderman issues?). When the quality of the Marvel Universe stunk up the magazine racks in the 1990s, it seemed if Spiderman would weave his last web.<br /><br />Letters, trial notes and other details fill in this adventurous tale of the struggle for power, money and egos. We find out how Spiderman was finally able to make the bigtime.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Comic Wars: How Two Tycoons Battled over the Marvel Comics Empire--And Both Lost\\" by Dan Raviv.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2003-05-02

It is big, with a plainly designed appearance. Major roads are shown, but the map maker kept it clean of confusing lines and symbols. Use the mileage chart to get a rough idea of how far cities are from each other. It is 1:600,000. You'll also get insets of Pecs, Lake Balaton, the Budapest transit system, Keszthely, the Tihany Peninsula, a calendar of major events, and a smattering of factiods and pictures.<br /><br />The book is for first-time visitors. Read about the basic history, with details about the major sites and why they exist, and information regarding the regions of the country, complete with captioned pictures. Among the more interesting aspects are the sidebars. Joszef Rippl-Ronai, the artist, is in there, as is curious bits about coffee and cake, goulash/gulyas, and a writer's cafe.<br /><br />If you are looking for an easy, quick and colorful overview of Hungarian travel, buy this book. It is relatively fresh, as should any book be of that general European region, in light of the economic and social changes.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Globetrotter Travel Pack Budapest\\" by Brian Richards.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2003-04-30

What Vatican II did in its influence of present day Catholic perspectives and outlook is well-known. What is often forgotten is the documents outlining the future understanding of what the Roman Catholic Church is.<br /><br />Catholics high school level and up should be introduced to this, particular those students concerned with understanding the official apologetic on tough issues. Protestants of all denominations will see how their own history has been intertwined with Roman Catholicism, and, from this volume, appreciate the similarities and differences. In fact, I bought my copy in a conservative Protestant bookstore, as the nearby Catholic store only sold gift books.<br /><br />In this first volume, \\"The Conciliar and Post Conciliar Documents,\\" you'll quickly see is not a teaching book like the new Catechism is intended. Instead, it is a collection of key papers, decrees and statements explaining Rome's view on issues as varied as the<br /><br />* liturgy<br />* worship music<br />* requirements to receive communion<br />* ecumenism<br />* bishops<br />* training of priests<br />* nonChristian religions and the Catholic Church's relationship to them<br />* defining and explaining divine revelation<br />* lay people<br />* religious liberty<br />* missionaries<br /><br />In many ways, this is far more substantive than the Catechism, in that it provides a more thorough Scriptural base in its reasoning. It is more of an anthology of legal decrees, and yet it accessible. It isn't in legalese, but it may refer to Articles and other documents unknown to some readers.<br /><br />The introduction realizes the reader may not be a Vatican scholar, and a quick, but useful overview of biblical and extrabiblical abbreviations. Each section thereafter has an introduction to provide context behind the need for developing the given decree.<br /><br />The appendix is strong, and will lead serious researchers to the precise document in question.<br /><br />The book appears to be set in a 10 pt. Times, with just a quarter to half inch margin, and the volume itself is delivered with an awkward dimension. The book is thicker than it should be, and the solution would've been bigger pages, and thus, a thinner book instead of the current 1062 pages. There is a study edition which is said to accommodate these concerns.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Vatican Council II: The Conciliar and Post Conciliar Documents (Vatican Collection, Volume 1).\\" It is just part of the beginning to understand the vastness of modern Catholic theology, but it is a highly readable book, and is officially recognized by Rome for its reliability.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comrter to half inch margin, and the volume itself is delivered with an awkward dimension.

Just the word. Below it, upside down, is a short definition for 'zealot' and a sentence using it in context. On the other side is the opposite: a definition for 'abase' and the word 'zealot', upside down. That's it.<br /><br />For the student who needs a convenient way to learn words (in this case 500), without getting to deep into the pronunciation and etymology, this is a good choice.<br /><br />Unlike many of the guides by Barron's, Peterson and the Princeton Review, this Kaplan book has the advantage of being small. The flashcard-style is handy for self-quizzing. There is no need to cover up words, or to laboriously write out lists.<br /><br />These aren't the obscure words meant for Scrabble and crossword puzzle champs. These are the words which have historically meant something to the preparers of SAT.<br /><br />A short selection of roots is provided as well, but it is the full words which makes it a worthy purchase, to augment a more complete study of SAT vocabulary.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2003-03-06

I am unsure how I'll tastefully work this into a sentence next Sunday at church, but I am glad to have such a word in my quiver should the occasion arise.<br /><br />Don't dismay if, while reading this, you feel you are seeing words new to you. Most of these words haven't escaped rare book rooms in 200 years. For example, we prefer, 'librarian' over 'bibliothecary' and children tend to choose 'sleepy' instead of 'Billy-wink.'<br /><br />As Kacirk defines words, he slips in a number of woodcut illustrations, adding to the appeal. They are always somehow correlated with a word on that page.<br /><br />Grab a glass of something cold, and thoughtfully stroke your 'ziff' (beard) while reading this in a 'zypthesary' (brewhouse).

Photos don't appear to be color-corrected, the spine is stiff, and the dimensions of the book are not practical.

It romanticizes the image and description, but excels as a history. As an anthology, it has much room for improvement, but this could be a result of the limits of performance poetry.<br /><br />Kerouac's ghost must wonder at how formulaic slam poetry has become. From the aggressive, ideological depth of Ginsberg and Burroughs, we now have the regurgitated flavors of Whitman-wannabes evoked pretentiously in the pop-soliloquys now barraging modern poetry readings. Yet, the slam has introduced thousands of young poets that poetry is worth their time. Glazner demonstrates this inconsistency, but not intentionally as we see the up and down quality of the poetry samples he provides.<br /><br />An excellent part of the book is the description of poetry slam rules, distinguishing local and national rules, and how this form is meant as an oral art form, not a written one. This is the challenge faced by every slam poetry book: how to present it. Some poems here make the transition, and there a few gems worth a read. Marc Smith, founder of the slam, has \\"My Father's Coat.\\" An interesting poem called \\"Ali\\" by Michael R. Brown. opens with the compelling \\"Five inches shorter than his fighting height\\" shows some fine imagery and intriguing approaches to poetry meeting culture.<br /><br />For a deeper look at Beat literature, see the \\"Beat Reader,\\" or for poetry only, \\"Beat Poets\\" edited by Carmela Ciuraru. \\"Poetry Slam\\" is a good start, but these books will provide better examples of the style and quality slam poets esteem to reach.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2003-03-03

They need your help, and it's your job as a company or concern to ensure they get three square meals.<br /><br />Remember reporters and editors -- like real people -- have limits on their time, knowledge and experience. They have misconceptions, biases, ignorance, and in general -- they are human. Mathis shows you how to respond to this humanity, positioning your company to be covered favorably and frequently by the media.<br /><br />Broken down into 12 rules, he presents not the technicalities of writing a press releasee or how to do public speaking. Rather, \\"Feeding the Media Beast\\" is about strategic principles.<br /><br />The key to do it all is to think like a teacher, to be prepared and to never let up. A teacher keeps it simple and repeats his message. You prepare for whatever the reporter may throw at you, but you also provide consistent resources for that same reporter prior top, during and after the interview. Why? Because it'll increase the likelihood you'll be quoted in a more accurate context, and that whenever the reporter needs information on your issue or topic, you'll get the call. You are just making the reporter's job easy.<br /><br />Sell your story on its emotional merits as well as through the facts, he says in Chapter 9, \\"The Rule of Education.\\" Remember what us your passion might not be obvious to the unaware reporter. Help him tell your story. This might include anecdotes, publicity stunts and cheap gimmicks. Call it hype, but if done well, it can reap great, colorful attention to your cause.<br /><br />Be forward thinking is the theme of \\"the Rule of Timing.\\" Opportunities are all fleeting, and require a correct, creative response. Mathis tells us of former President Bill Clinton's ability to push forth his agenda when a national event like the OJ trial was occurring. Ideas which might not have gone over well went unnoticed because the nation was captivated by white vans and gloves which did not fit.<br /><br />Bias, Mathis remarks, exists. This is particularly evident in matters of religion as indicated by overwhelmingly persuasive statistics. The media is generally swinging toward the left, as shown through a 1992 Roper Poll which said a full 89% voted for Bill Clinton, and only 7% voted for Bush, Sr. You, the publicity person, must realize this and work within this fact.

I wish its value was more than that, but it isn't. It is neither passionate nor any more informative than its competitors.<br /><br />In the business books I have read recently, I found this one lacks the authority and substance I found in others. William Pollard's \\"Soul of the Firm\\" has the authority, as he took ServiceMaster to a new level. \\"Values of the Game\\" by Bill Bradley was worth the read because of Bradley's unique metaphorical look at life. \\"Leadership\\" by Rudolph Giuliani has power because of what Giuliani has gone through. \\"Portraits,\\" however, has a flaccid tone to it. I felt as if it was researched information regurgitated into book form. I felt like I was reading the kind of book which gets sold after a corporate sales seminar.<br /><br />The book, as seen in the subtitle, can be boiled down to nine major points. In each, Hutcheson retells stories of business success and failures, from security company founder Richard Wackenhut to Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.<br /><br />Action items accompany each chapter, and herein lay the book's greatest value. Hutcheson provides a topic sentence to lead the mini-lesson, but weakly completes the thesis in the following paragraphs.<br /><br />The redundancy of subject matter mixed with a bland presentation has me suggesting to you to look elsewhere. It was not edited tightly enough to build the necessary tension and excitement. Overall, \\"Portraits of Success: 9 Keys to Sustaining Value in Any Business\\" lacks the poignancy I have come to expect from professional advancement books.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2003-02-25

They bring in not only their experience together, but also their expertise in scholarship and understanding of God's Word.<br /><br />Many books discussing fatherhood are based on pure psychology, even among Christian titles. \\"Fathering Like the Father\\" takes a different tack, focusing on the Scriptural basis for decisions a father must make in regard to rearing his child. This book can augment what James Dobson and Focus on the Family books teach. Likewise, PromiseKeeper men should connect solidly with the principles presented here.<br /><br />Each chapter begins with a key passage and a biblical character. Chapter 11, \\"Find Us Faithful\\" highlights Elkanah and Psalm 146:5-9. It is followed by several pages discussing the related issues, using modern parables, statistical analyses, while driving home why the verses they chose are crucial. Jeffrey and Kenn then each has a subsection for their take on the passage and principle.<br /><br />The chapters also include a few challenges in a section called \\"Making It Work,\\" discussion questions useful in a small group or Sunday School/CCD context, and some things for father-child dialogue. It is meant to be read with a Bible open. If you find it as engaging as I did, your copy will be marked up with underlined sentences and quotes drawn from history.<br /><br />Chapters include:<br />* Make 'Em Laugh: Humor<br />* An Officer or a Gentleman? Grace and Mercy<br />* Focus on the Father: Forgiveness<br />* The Ultimate Sacrifice: Love<br />* The Green-Eyed Monster?

Also like the other books on the \\"how to live life better\\" are inspiring anecdotes of famous success stories, like Mary Kay Ash and Truett Kathy. It sounds like an Amway sales seminar.<br /><br />Where I think this book is different is that Maxwell feels free to acknowledge failure as a given. Rather than pretending failure is a negative attitude, he unpretentiously says failure should be embraced. It is part of the risk process.<br /><br />Failure, Maxwell contends, is part of success. His play on words \\"failing forward\\" instead of \\"falling forward\\" is means more than to bring a smile. Like a running back in football, tackled hard by a player much bigger, will try to use the momentum of falling to reach the football another foot or two into the end zone. If he fell backwards, he loses a yard. If he falls forward, his team gets a touchdown. That is more or less Maxwell's thesis in the book.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Failing Forward: How to Make the Most of Your Mistakes\\" by John Maxwell.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2003-02-24

In fact, he thought so much of the book, he passed around a half dozen copies that year to close relatives as Christmas gifts.<br /><br />I, far less a student of the game, felt I might be at a disadvantage. Not so. Bradley's expertise of basketball is lucid, and his writing illuminates with clarity the salient aspects beyond my ignorance.<br /><br />This is an inspirational book. It isn't the kind of inspiration found in a John Maxwell book, which is layered in points and subpoints. This is all much simpler than that.<br /><br />It sums up to: \\"Play hard, practice often, have goals and never give up.\\" Bradley does this with great photos, powerful anecdotes and a consistent message.<br /><br />His examples are right on, with memories of great players of old, like Cousy and Chamberlain, as well as current stars like Iverson and Pippen. He even brings in a few Muggsy Bogues stories, and incorporates several pages highlighting WNBA players.<br /><br />Occasionally, it comes off forced. Not every player he uses for his parables are squeaky clean, even though, as Phil Jackson cites in the introduction, Bradley himself is a committed Christian. This makes for carefully worded analyses of the situation like when referring to Dennis Rodman's famous get-the-ball-even-if-it-hurts rebounding attitude. Bradley merely acknowledges Rodman \\"isn't everyone's cup of tea\\" while he admires his tenacity.<br /><br />Check this one out. The photos alone are worth the price, and you might feel the need to get out and shoot some ball.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2003-02-24

It did the job for me.<br /><br />\\"Courtroom Guide for Non-Lawyers\\" by Benjamin Cantor is a tidy summary of legal terms someone is likely to encounter in the midst of a trial. For me, involved at one time in a lawsuit, I found Cantor's book a wealth of information. I wish I had read his book then.<br /><br />Cantor demonstrates expertise deftly as he disseminates only relevant information. Legal things can be overwhelming, but Cantor smartly keeps things straightforward. Appendix D, \\"Glossary of Legal Terms\\" does not bog the reader down with loquacious definitions, but crisply explains terms like \\"ad litem\\" and \\"nolo contendere\\" in a line or two.<br /><br />Where Cantor's book lacks is in the printing. The text is printed poorly, having the look that it was taken over to the local quickie print and the printer lacked enough ink.

This Cliffs Notes volume helps clear up the seemingly muddy waters.<br /><br />While not all Cliffs Notes are worth buying, in this case, it can enhance and encourage the reading process. They explain the many characters in two sections.<br /><br />The first is not unlike what introduces many playbills. For example, for Sonia, it says \\"Sofya's nickname.\\" Maybe that it is common in Russia, but it would have thrown me for a loop. For Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, it says, \\"A poverty-stricken student who conceives a theory of the superman or extraordinary man as a justification or rationalization for his crime.\\"<br /><br />The second guide explains in a page or two the context and major concerns of only a few characters.<br /><br />Because they have Russian names unfamiliar to most of us in the United States, their little guide will be handy to keep open as you read the actual book.<br /><br />The chapter synopsis is also useful for teachers who are overwhelmed with responsibilities. I have used it for this reason with a private student. I had not read the work and needed to be up to speed quickly. The synopsis put the book in context, making expectation available to me as I read. This helped me know what was worth focusing on in our all-to-brief look at this classic.<br /><br />Other sections explain motifs and arguments of Hegel and Nietzsche regarding the superman ideas presented. Lacking is a section on biblical references, which, for students without much biblical knowledge, will limit their appreciation of the depth of \\"Crime and Punishment.\\" Judith Gunn's \\"Dostoyesky: Dreamer and Prophet\\" is a good follow-up for the student looking to understand Dostoyesky religious perspective and Russian nationalism.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Cliffs Notes Crime and Punishment\\" by James L.

Most of journalism involves local newspapers covering local people, and despite how the internet has altered the speed and process of interviewing, good ol' gumshoe journalism still lives and breathes. That's why this book still matters 30 years after it first hit the college bookstores of j-school.<br /><br />A good interview requires knowledge, diplomacy, fearlessness, rapport, organization, and knowing how to separate and summarize it all for a good story. This book has chapters on all of this. One complete chapter, \\"Off the Record\\" discusses some interesting approaches and policies this misunderstood phrase calls for. As you build relationships with key sources, this chapter, and others, can assist you in seeing ways through the thorny challenges of integrity and journalism.<br /><br />Brady provides anecdotes about complicated interviews and interviewees. Even though these are with celebrities, the examples show the reader how to walk the line carefully and confidently.<br /><br />\\"The Craft of Interviewing\\" by John Brady should not be the only book you read, and probably not your first.

This book will get you there.<br />\\"Effective Phrases for Performance Appraisals: A Guide to Successful Evaluations\\" by James E.

For 'accuracy' there are 24 phrases, like \\"expects perfection\\" and \\"meets precise standards.\\"<br /><br />The drawback is twofold: the layout wastes space, and the content is easily found in other, more substantive books.

This, for me, was enough to by &quot;95 Poems.&quot;<br />The poems have no titles except for numbers. While this might dismiss the need for a table of contents, it makes referencing a poem here difficult. Luckily, the publishers chose to include first lines in the contents. High school students will find &quot;57&quot; (&quot;old age sticks&quot;), the first Cummings' poem most us encounter.

Allowing the unique use of punctuation and line breaks to become like notes in a score, things came together for me, and this poetry became less obtuse.

When I received &quot;Discovering Wine&quot; by Joanna Simon as a gift, I felt intimidated. Would it be stuffy or over my head?<br />Its strength is in the simple presentation of the facts. The chapters are clearly titled, like &quot;Matching food with wine&quot; and &quot;Ways to store your wine.&quot; The writing is clean, though it comes across slightly elitist (ex: choosing 'wend' instead of 'wind,' noting a certain country produces a 'credible' variety of wine).

He picked all of the poems except for the posthumously chosen and edited \\"Elegy.\\"<br /><br />Every poet writes hundreds, even thousands, of poems. Some are experiments with form or message, others might be intended only for a small audience. Sometimes, the poet pens some that, when looking back, just stink. A good, humble poet knows this when collecting the ones worth remembering. Thomas' \\"Collected Poems\\" has strained out his weaker verse, avoiding the temptation of ego to overwhelm us with every line in the almost twenty-year period from which he draws.<br /><br />Thomas hand-picked these gems. Any beginning student of poetry will know \\"Do not go gentle into that good night.\\" They might also know \\"And death shall have no dominion.\\"<br /><br />Thomas was what few poets were. He was a poet's poet, yet entirely accessible by the average reader. He managed to construct poems that appeal aesthetically to nonpoets, with layers to be appreciated with each new look. He could be studied for his technique and craft, and enjoyed at face value in a public reading.<br /><br />Unlike many poets, Thomas does not rely on obscure literary allusions requiring extensive footnotes, as T. S. Eliot sometimes seemed. Instead of giving us a lesson in vocabulary, he used ordinary words and phrases enriched by their juxtaposition and careful choice to exalt his messages. Even his somewhat glum \\"The tombstone told when she died,\\" I find myself reading aloud:<br /><br />She cried her white-dresses limbs were bare<br />And her red lips were kissed black,<br />She wept in her pain and made mouth,<br />Talked and tore though her eyes smiled.<br /><br />Nicely presented, you'll find poems start on a new page rather than stream them one after another. This leaves white space, and provides for a cleaner look at the individual poem. I prefer this method because the poem seems to begin better, as it is set apart from the others.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Collected Poems of Dylan Thomas 1934-1952\\" by Dylan Thomas.

Because of this, I bring it to church. It lacks the study Bible attributes I enjoy in other editions, but, in church, I am not likely to spend the time required to utilize those features.<br />What I have it a sturdy paperback with a few footnotes to indicates translations variants, or to define an odd term or two. It is flexible, and can withstand (as mine has) being tossed into a briefcase or handbag without worry.<br />The margins are about the size of any novel, and so notes are difficult to write, but this its best use is as a second or third Bible, not for primary study. Its strength is its clean presentation and portability.<br />A basic, 62-page concordance is in the back, listing a few citations for key terms for easy lookup during Sunday school.<br />A section called &quot;Biblical Backgrounds&quot; surveys in a few paragraphs the function and history of all 66 books. This brief introduction says who is believed to have written, for example, I and II Chronicles (Ezra) and how it relates to other books (Samuel and Kings). Short and sweet, the reader will be able to get a quick look in the middle of a sermon and track better the context of the references.<br />The words of Jesus are in red. Others might find this distracting, but when I am ooking something up, knowing Jesus said something, but unable to remember the verse number, this helps.<br />The paper is of a decent width without making this book 100 pounds. Set in a Times New Roman or similar typeface, at what appears to be a 10 pt font, I find it easily readable.<br />It is a paragraphed Bible, meaning that contiguous ideas are connected using paragraphs, much in the same way we do in modern English, complete with indentation. This makes the reading more natural.<br />There are a few short introductions explaining the principles of translation (how Hebrew tenses were considered, for example), and an &quot;Explanation of General Format,&quot; which succinctly presents the ways the publishers of this version managed Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic translation difficulties and what modern punctuation was employed that was unknown during the time of the Bible's writing.<br />A note on the translation:<br />The New American Standard translation claims to &quot;adhere as closely as possible to the original languages of the Holy Scriptures, and to make the translation in a fluent and readable style accordingly to current English usage.&quot; There are paraphrased editions, like the New International Version (NIV) or New Living Translation that are both more reader friendly. In buying any translation, I suggest looking over samples of each to see which best fits your purposes.

Chernev and Harkness used photos of the board as well as standard board drawings. They require modernized, as the photos are a bit blurry, and the drawings have an old newspaper keyline look. The copy is succinct, but not dry. As a reader, I found it less clinical than many of the chess books with dozens of lines per opening.<br /><br />This is a long way from anything Lasker or Fischer wrote, but the audience intended here is looking to play the game effectively, unworried about becoming a grandmaster.

This doesn't mean the fast runner, or the experienced runner, but it does mean the runner who intends to stay on the path of running fitness with consistency.<br />How will you, the committed runner, be encouraged? First and foremost, by the recording and tracking of your workouts. It isn't complicated. There are spots to write down the important aspects of your run. While you could do this in a spreadsheet like Excel (which I also do), what you'll find here is an attractive layout. Instead of looking at he clinical cells of a computer program, you get to see things in a comfortable format.<br />The log will help you consider the value of each run, and realize the hard work you are doing is paying off. Should you feel burned out, you can look back and see what might have caused it. Over-training? Bad weather? Too many miles?

Intended for the thinking Christian and the open-minded nonChristian, Martin's book has continually challenged people to rely on Scripture for their theology.<br /><br />This is an unusual book in that it is neither an evangelical or fundamentalism critique of those who disagree, but a deeper look at the histories, documents, arguments at groups in opposition to orthodoxy. I first read this skeptically, but was impressed by the immense research by Martin and his team of editors.<br /><br />There is a dual functionality to \\"The Kingdom of the Cults.\\" Not only does it explain the distinctives of groups such as the Jehovah Witnesses and the Church of the Latter Day Saints, but in doing so, it teaches Scriptural fundamentals of the Trinity, the deity of Christ, and provides direction for testing our own faith with the Bible. Martin's exposure of what the groups themselves are claiming will disturb many within the group as they discover the truth. He is quick to grant the strengths of a group, but points them to Scripture to make their own comparisons (as opposed to relying on Martin's views). He prefers the reader to think for himself, not content to depend on his book, or any other book but the Bible. This balance is rare in Christian literature, and a value in reading \\"The Kingdom of the Cults.\\"<br /><br />Martin provides a meaty analysis of all the major groups, as well as primary lines of thought within Protestant perspectives, and Roman Catholicism. Beyond specific groups, there is plenty of coverage of the general critical analysis on topics like mind control, apocalyptic cults, the impact of cults on the mission field, Eastern religions, and language and psychological issues.<br /><br />He is sure to point out a group's popularity (like the fast growing LDS and Islam sects) doesn't make it truth, truth is not democratic.<br /><br />Martin is bold to use the groups' own literature rather than hearsay, to prove his points. This has stirred controversy among those such as Muslim students, LDS laity and JW leadership who have not known of the difficult history of their church. He leaves room for the vagaries often existing when dependent on secondary sources.<br /><br />This edition includes substantial portions of the refutations and other dialogues, providing the reader an idea of the response from the cult's leadership. Sadly, it shows that though the book is quickly disputed, none take Martin to task. In many cases, they agree, but are uncomfortable at the label 'cult.'<br /><br />The bibliography is 27 pp strong, organized by topic and group. This is in addition to the 12-page Scripture Index.<br /><br />\\"The Kingdom of the Cults\\" includes an appendix of several groups. For example, the Worldwide Church of God's full acceptance of the Trinity is explained, as well as the foundation for this significant move in their theology.<br /><br />\\"The Kingdom of the Cults\\" also criticizes the Word of Faith movement. It is careful to show what this movement believes, and how it is not simply Pentecostalism under another name. \\"The Kingdom of the Cults\\" emphasizes \\"there are many sincere, born again believers within the movement\\" (Hank Hanagraaff).<br /><br />I recommend \\"The Kingdom of the Cults\\" enthusiastically.

Oprah Winfrey is there more than once, including, \\"I'm never going to run another marathon.\\"<br /><br />There's honesty. Distance star Rob de Castella on marathoning, \\"If you feel bad after 10 miles, you're in trouble. If you feel bad at 20 miles, you're normal. If you don't feel bad at 26 miles, you're abnormal.\\"<br /><br />There's wit. Don Kardong frankly said about registering a race with hills, \\"You entered a marathon with hills? You idiot.\\"<br /><br />Then there is the curious odd quotes. Finland's great Olympic marathoner, Lasse Viren enthusiastically revealed his secret to racing success, \\"Reindeer milk!\\" Whatever might be dubious about Viren's claim is difficult to argue.

Like C. S. Lewis', \\"A Grief Observed,\\" Taylor is free to acknowledge sometimes he has doubts in the midst of his faith. This paradox, says Taylor, is an indication of great faith, and through this questioning, the Christian can become strong, and more capable of serving God. The reflective Christian, with a tested faith, has a more honest witness.<br /><br />To start the book, Taylor asks 16 questions. Reader of Mark Noll's \\"The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind,\\" will resonate with many of them, like #4, \\"Have you ever felt intellectually embarrassed to admit you were a Christian?\\"<br /><br />Taylor is a literary man, citing writers as far ranging as Hopkins, Eliot, Pascal, and even Lenny Bruce (\\"People are leaving churches and returning to God\\"). I suspect his intention was to broaden and challenge readers who might be in accord with the quote, but not the one quoted.<br /><br />He introduces Alex Adamson, a fictitious man who exists to establish anecdotes and parables quite effectively. As Luci Shaw is quoted in a back cover blurb, \\"I recognize myself on every page.\\" Alex struggles with existentialism, moral choices, and all kinds of philosophical dilemmas common to our modern generation.<br /><br />Taylor is critical of both liberal Christianity's allowal of the secular world to determine their agenda, and of conservative Christianity's too often denial of free thinking. Also, the secular world, he contends, only allows Christianity so long as it doesn't affect your judgments. He dashes off no easy answers, but enters into a compelling dialogue with the reader.<br /><br />Taylor's message in \\"The Myth of Certainty,\\" is like Mark Twain's in \\"The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg\\" that our personal and corporate faith as a Christian needs to be challenged, that it must be reflective, and never arrogantly complacent, lest it be built on sandy soil. The risk of asking -- even as a mature Christian believer -- \\"What is Truth?\\" is far less than the risk of ignoring the depth found in discovering truth.<br /><br />I fully recommend this as both personal reading, and in a small group book study context.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comsking -- even as a mature Christian believer -- \\"What is Truth?\\" is far less than the risk of ignoring the depth found in discovering truth.

I've heard him read, and he reads with intensity. Unfortunately, his collection of poetry, \\"Crowdpleaser\\" holds little of the energy his performances do.<br />\\"Crowdpleaser\\" comes across as self-indulgent, self-conscious, stream-of-conscious prosiac poetry-talk. I was not impressed at this Beat Generation imitation. I've heard better poetry in college town coffeehouse open-mikes. Kerouac and Ginsberg both survive being published in print form. They did not rely on shock or profanity for its own sake, giving the reader rich images and philosophical depth Smith does not. Smith's poems sound like mimics of Walt Whitman or Ginsberg, but without the originality to even make them entertaining parodies.<br />He flops from strong image to overstated emotion. Granted, those who love poetry drawn from emotive prose will love \\"Crowdpleaser,\\" and will take me to task, but I think this poetic effort falls flat.<br />Lines like \\"You don't even know what a real poem is!/You wouldn't know a real poem if it hit you in the face!\\" using boldface and CAPS comes across sophomoric at best, and low-brow teenage diary angst at worst.<br />There are a few shining phrases in this collection of urban verse. His poem \\"Watching secretly from the stair\\" has more than cliche in his sentimental recollection of watching his daughter lip-synching.<br />\\"Pupils fierce and flaming hair--<br />Mute she sings,<br />Arms outstretched,<br />A last scratched note.\\"<br />He provides introductions for many of his poems, and for those who follow the poetry slam scene might find this intriguing.

She discusses with candor romantic relationships. There is an excellent question-answer section for friends and family.<br /><br />The best value comes from the chapter on restructuring. At a certain point, someone with ADD knows what's going on, but what they want to know is how to deal with it. Weiss shows the way with example charts that can realistically applied.<br /><br />The singular drawback to this book is its need for an update. Research has been exploding with new ideas in medication, diagnoses and management. Weiss tackles all of this in a 60+ page Appendices section, with contact information for support groups, organizations, and sample official letters to interested parties. Year to year, these lists can quickly become out of date.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Weiss for the reason that through every one of her books, she's a pragmatist.

Whether it is the sign in front or the door to door evangelism, and even a small ad announcing next week's sermon, that is marketing, and is not an unholy idea. When you created those things, you thought about the people who would be seeing them, and applied what you knew.<br />Barna shows what marketing really is, and how it can help remove the roadblocks from people coming to a church. Pastor Bill Hybels at the megachurch, Willow Creek in IL, knows this stuff and has seen plenty of growth--and plenty of new believers! Barna is an evangelical, with a conservative base, and his book stats true to this.<br />He explains carefully the principles behind the term marketing. He knows it is a daunting word, and that some people can and have abused marketing within Christendom.<br />He emphasizes knowing your market, and that you don't need fancy statistics to get the job done. You know your neighbor.<br />One thing which Barna challenges the reader to do--and church leaders at large--is to articulate and write down what they know. The sum of what they know is probably large, but when it written, it can be organized, and from that, strategized.<br />The strategy is the book's strength. Using gifts as provided by the Lord, church leaders draw from their resources and build a marketing plan. Barna is certain to point out this job is bigger than the pastor, but will require many people if things are to be carried out well.<br />Fundamentally, Barna would agree, that a church marketing plan is merely applying the church's mission statement into several steps. If you want to bring together another 200 people each Sunday, and you have currently 100, how will this happen? Newspaper ads? Flyers? Radio commercials? Special events? All of the above?

Would I like to be famous?<br />There's some more adult topic questions in here, so it isn't the book to leave around your son's third grade CCD classroom.<br />The value of this book is that it presents permission to ask question you've already the right to ask, or have been wise enough not to poke into.

This clarity of belief counters some of these modern writers' assertions that God is whomever you decides he or she shall be. His stance toward Christ is bound to offend nonChristians, but they most likely will not be customers of the book.<br />In fact, as you read, it is imperative to have your Bible next to you, and a notepad next to that. Don't be surprised if through reading you have a lot of \\"Aha!\\" moments, as you connect with things you may have long forgotten.<br />Fans of John Maxwell will find kinship in Warren's mission of practicality and approach.<br />Learn what are the basics of purposes before God, and what this means to the everyday Christian. In the current surge of openness among Americans to consider their own Christian upbringing, Warren presents that Jesus Christ alone can provide the security and structure of a fulfilled life, that Christ should be the purpose. He is careful not to sound monkish, and is clear as he describes that we live in this world.<br />He covers:<br />* Worship<br />* Fellowship<br />* Discipleship<br />* Ministry<br />* Mission<br />Unfortunately, the book is limited by its workshop tone. Like so many other self-help books, it seems as if the writer is promoting his seminars and brand name. In fact, the book is widely available for use in post-seminar small groups. This distraction, however, needs to be set aside as the reader asks the question, \\"Do I know who I am, do I know why I am here today, and do I know where I'm going?\\" Warren helps sort through the muck, and guide the reader toward discovering both the need for a purpose, and the purpose itself. This stuff matters, and this book can help get you there.<br />I fully recommend \\"Purpose-Driven Life\\" by Rick Warren.<br />Anthony Trendluck, and guide the reader toward discovering both the need for a purpose, and the purpose itself.

1338335:US	52558011	RSEGF0UVM5EJM	0310283418	147731336	The Ministry and Message of Paul	Books	5	14	14	N	N	Succinct but Powerful Introduction to Paul	&quot;Ministry and Message of Paul&quot; is one of those hidden Christian books that needs discovery by churches. I came across this in a survey course at Wheaton College, and through it learned the context behind Paul's letters and journeys.<br />I recommend it for use in any Sunday School or CCD course looking to know what Paul was hoping to accomplish, who he was, and how God was working through him.<br />Though used in many college classrooms, Longenecker's book is not an overblown academic volume only understood by PhDs. Rather, it is comfortably accessible to anyone who is able to process any of the more popular history books, like &quot;John Adams.&quot; Or, if a reader can understand the &quot;New York Times,&quot; they'll have no trouble with &quot;The Ministry and Message of Paul.&quot;<br />Much of the book is piecing together what is already known from Scripture with what is known of the times in which Paul lived. Longenecker cites from Patristic writers, namely Clement of Rome, Justin Martyr, Presbyter of Asia, Clement of Alexandria, Eusebius and Jerome. He also uses classical authors, such as Josephus, Ovid, Euripides. He refers several times to the Dead Sea Scrolls, and to various intertestamental books (like Sirach, both Maccabees, Baruch) The author takes several pages to explain how he used his sources, and to what extent their values were in preparing his text.<br />Paul, of course, wrote most of the New Testament. We see here how Paul was unflinchingly focused, and hardworking to organize people, lead churches, plan long sea journeys all for the purpose of spreading the gospel. Most of all, as Scripture was written then to be lived now, Longenecker spends a brief chapter on why Paul's message matters to this generation. He doesn't preach, but he does express a cogent presentation of Paul's modern significance.<br />Chapters include:<br />* Intro<br />* The Man and the Pharisee<br />* Conversion and Early Ministry<br />* First Missionary Journey<br />* The Jerusalem Council<br />* Second Missionary Journey<br />* Third Missionary Journey<br />* Imprisonments and Martyrdom<br />* The Pauline Message<br />* The Relevance of Paul for Today<br />The bibliography is 10 pages long, providing any serious student plenty of homework.<br />I fully recommend &quot;The Ministry and Message of Paul&quot; by Richard Longenecker.<br />Anthony TrendlJerusalem Council<BR>* Second Missionary Journey<BR>* Third Missionary Journey<BR>* Imprisonments and Martyrdom<BR>* The Pauline Message<BR>* The Relevance of Paul for Today<br />The bibliography is 10 pages long, providing any serious student plenty of homework. <br />I fully recommend &quot;The Ministry and Message of Paul&quot; by Richard Longenecker.<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-11-16

I'd find a butterfly (or moth, as the case may be) and approximate which one it was through this guide.<br />The pictures are accurate. Not only will you see the butterfly, but a close up of various parts. There are maps showing where it can be found, a very useful tool when the picture doesn't seem to match. It can help you determine if you have a certain variation, or a very lost butterfly.<br />Though a picture is worth a thousand words, the text found here is equally helpful. There are Latin names, pupae descriptions, eating habits and more. They've been careful not to overwhelm the reader, but there's plenty to whet the reading appetite of any young butterfly hunter.<br />It isn't just for children. Anyone with a garden would be happy to have this as a reference or as curious reading to learn just who has been munching the lettuce.<br />I fully recommend &quot;Butterflies and Moths&quot; by Robert T. Mitchell.<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-11-06

Succinct, he isn't bound to entertain the reader, but educate him.<br />His glossary of typographic terms will bring you into the know about apertures, dot leaders, nuts and muttons.<br />Just as useful is his thorough appendix of sorts and characters. With an image of the characters, he explains in a few sentences what characters is when it is to be used properly. He distinguishes acutes from graves from primes from hois from apostrophes. Adjacent to this lexicon is a quick visual index of alphabetic character. This section alone was worth the price for me.<br />The real science of &quot;The Elements of Typographic Style&quot; is in Bringhurst's bulk of explanations of letter construction, page composition, defining and given shorts histories of classic fonts as seen in specimen books, a great chapter on analphabetic symbols.<br />I fully recommend this book. Artists, designers, illustrators all should have a copy of this. It reads easier than you might suspect, and would serve as a fine textbook. Writers should read it for no other reason than it is interesting, but to also have pity on our poor designers who must make our words look nice.<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-10-31

Protestant. Evangelical. Charismatic. Everyone who is Christian and desires to serve God either through overseas missions, or in their own hometown will be inspiried to read of Taylor's humble heart and gracious service.<br /><br />This could be considered a case study in prayer. Taylor did not send scores of appeal letters, newsletters, refridgerator photos. His practice was to not solicit funds, but to ask God for providence.<br /><br />He endured blisters, lack of medicine, thievery, poverty on every level. He'd wait for months for resources, but the miracle of God was always there.<br /><br />Written with ample selections from his personal journal, we gain insight to a man hailed as one of the greatest missionaries ever, and the foremost in China. That insight is not of a powerful speaker, dynamic personality, or shining star in the pulpit. Instead, we see an ordinary man, not so different than you or I, pressing on in faith, moving forward as God led him. God prevailed to supply him every need, though often in the last moment.<br /><br />Beyond learning about Taylor, we also learn the intimate history of the founding of the China Inland Mission in 1856, and its influential growth in China. We gain a sense of the culture and interpersonal dynamics which existed in China, London, and mission leadership in general.<br /><br />Because of the foundational evangelism by Taylor, China now boasts extraordinary amounts of believers despite China's present oppressive government.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Hudson Taylor\\" by Hudson Taylor.

If you've not bought this yet, you haven't started looking.<br />Richard Bolles is the expert. His books sell because they are fresh each year with insight, purpose and ideas for determining what job you should do, and how to get it.<br />I used \\"Parachute\\" to get my first job. It continues to influence me today, as I job hunt again.<br />Thoroughly practical, Bolles asks you questions about your mission in life. His belief is that just getting a job -- even ones you are good at -- won't be a wise decision in the long haul. He helps you see your passions mixed with skills and experience, and guides you to getting their. Though it is hardly a self-help book, it is far more useful than the ones clogging up the Top 10 list.<br />He keeps you accountable. Finding a job is your job if that's what you say you want. And if you aren't working, he won't let you make excuses -- you've got the time. Either you are looking or you aren't. Dr. Phil could take a note from Bolles' direct yet congenial style.<br />Don't bother with the hardcover. You need the paperback. This is not a sit-on-the-shelf book, but a get-down-to-business book, and you'll appreciate the flexibility while at work or on the train.<br />I fully recommend, \\"What Color Is Your Parachute\\" by Richard Nelson Bolles.<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-10-30

At the time, those following the crime believed David Hendricks was guilty, but Vogel's book challenged the thoroughness of the police, questioned their biases and their understanding of religious matters.<br /><br />The story details the events surrounding the murder of three children and their mother, and whether or not the father was guilty. The father, out of town when the police discovered the bodies, claimed an alibi. The police determined, through statements from models he used for his catalog for his company, that perhaps David Hendricks was not faithful to his wife. No affairs were discovered, but the model statements still showed a poor light on Hendrick's commitment to his wife.<br /><br />Hendricks was a lay leader in a relatively small, conservative group of evangelical Christians called the Plymouth Brethren. The police did not realize that this group, though small, shared its basic theology with many Baptist denominations, as well as other better-known Christian groups. Instead, the police surmised that since divorce was discouraged in the Plymouth Brethren, Hendricks felt he needed to kill his family in order to be free of the marriage. Vogel describes the small-town ignorance of the police detectives and prosecutors by using their own trial testimoy. The prosecutor's logical jump was preposterous, but it played heavily into the trial.<br /><br />The town, in a near OJ Simpson trial like frenzy, fed off the news, and the story became both local scandal and national news.<br /><br />Confusing the matter was Hendrick's intense demeanor. He was well-read, and well-thought out, and by no means a man to react over-emotionally. His seemingly calm response, which may have been based on his faith or general personality, caused the police to see Hendricks cynically. Though they weren't country bumpkins, they weren't on the intellectual caliber of Hendricks, a star graduate of Northwestern University and inventor of a top-selling piece of medical equipment.<br /><br />At issue in the trial was if Hendricks had the opportunity to have been at home at the time of the murders. He claimed no, the police claimed yes. The key evidence was the time of death as determined by the digestion of food the children ate. If that could be verified, then the suspect Hendricks was either cleared or very likely the culprit.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Reasonable Doubt\\" for readers looking to think in this older, yet continually popular true crime book.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />americanspeechwriter.comHendricks, a star graduate of Northwestern University and inventor of a top-selling piece of medical equipment.<br /><br />At issue in the trial was if Hendricks had the opportunity to have been at home at the time of the murders.

They do not ask you any inane questions about authors who no one has ever read. That would be taking trivia a step farther than what is useful. Anyone with a decent reading list will know many of the questions, and the authors present them in such a way that it also turns out to be fun learning.<br /><br />What will you learn? Delightfully, nothing of consequence. Each chapter begins with a pithy discussion of what little quiz or game is to follow.<br /><br />For example: in a chapter about how books end, Gilleland and Lederer tells us about the origin of \\"cock and bull stories\\". Then, they list 15 quotes to match with 15 books, and then 15 authors to match accordingly. They also generously supply the answers.<br /><br />You'll ponder pen names, significant numbers, the Bible in the news (impressive overall subsection on this influential book), and, of course, a fair dose of Shakespeare trivia.<br /><br />Every chapter is succinct. Get stuck or bored with one? Move onward.<br /><br />This is more than bathroom bookshelf fodder, but a couch and cola book. Teachers can use this to excite students about books. Any coffeeshop owner ought to grab a few copies as well.<br /><br />By the way, yes: Milton, Melville and Mencken are in here.<br /><br />Do I recommend \\"Literary Trivia: Fun and Games for Book Lovers\\" by Michael Gilleland and Richard Lederer?

This book is about those original meanings of cliches.<br />This is different than most 'unusual word' dictionaries. Usually, you'll get the term, maybe a pronunciation and a short definiton. Instead, here we are introduced to where the word came from. He explains it carefully in layman's language. He doesn't gussy up his book with high-fallootin' lexographical phrasology.<br />For example, he defines (for a camel to pass through the) \\"eye of a needle\\" by describing it biblical origination, and connects it with a Jewish town gateway so small only pedestrians and the smallest of camels can pass through, not large camels (hence, protecting the town from pillagers). Christ famously refers to this in the New Testament, forever placing the phrase in our vernacular.<br />Jordan tosses our way what 'doughboy,' 'hair of the dog,' 'grandfather clock,' 'corn,' 'boondoggle,' 'nose to the grindstone.\\"<br />'Manna' for example, means, \\"What is it?\\" as the Isrealites had no idea what they were being given. 'Maudlin,' Jordan reveals, is from the British pronunciation of 'Magdalene,' and that early artists painted Mary Magdalene with a dour demeanor.<br />Editorial historians might differ with Jordan as per the precise origin of 'OK.' They would argue that it was a silly joke--an intended deviation of \\"all correct\\" (oll korekt) as written on acceptable copy. Jordan suggests that it is from Martin Van Buren's nickname of Old Kinderhook while he ran for office.<br />Knowing this is not a scientific text, you can enjoy this as I did, as something to wander through while sipping tea and munching warm scones on an early Saturday morning.

Pollard's achievements are incredible, and a reader should expect an incredible book from him.<br /><br />Pollard's history involves running one of the most impressive service companies ever, ServiceMaster. He took it from an already solid company and helped it become a great company through buyouts, aggressive expansion, and managing with integrity. He deserves to be hailed into a management hall of fame. His book, however, lacks depth.<br /><br />We read what he thinks, and this is good stuff. In fact, everything in here is good stuff. His views on God, what his faith means in the workplace, how to be a servant leader. I'm nodding my head saying \\"Preach it!\\" as I write. But give us more, Mr. Pollard. Give us details of a businessman's business, not a book for upper mangement to give to middle managers on a work retreat to read on the train commute.<br /><br />Don't repeat Carnegie, Drucker with a Christian backdrop. We've read their books. Give us meat. ServiceMaster has had some complex issues they've struggled through. Did overexpansion complicate stock prices? As society continues to secularize, what does this mean to a once faith-based company? Will it go the way of the YMCA, with its roots merely as its history, or will it hold tight to the core principles and God which wrought those principles?<br /><br />Challenge us, Mr. Pollard. How does a Christian who is a top manager deal with underpaid staff workers who can barely pay their rent? Give them raises? Bonuses? If their valuable service defines the company's value, how are they to be treated? How does the leader of a huge company deal both corporately and personally with world economic issues, as it affects the microworld surrounding the local office? How does a Christian leader avoid bias in promoting staff? How do top leaders accept long hours and responsibilities, while yet having a family?<br /><br />None of that is adequately addressed in \\"Soul of the Firm.\\"<br /><br />So much is not being said in this book that I was disappointed.

Often three lines, set in Italics Times, page one headlines of the &quot;New York Times&quot; defined American news for years. The internet, and national papers have diminished this effect somewhat, but for most of the Twentieth Century, the NYT was the news. Because of their influence, they were not only the reporters, but the generators of our news. If they didn't report it, one might wonder if it really happened.<br />This edition has no glorious essays explaining how wonderful people were in 1955, or how great the generation was in 1940. Instead, we get page one completed, unedited.<br />Only the days which made big news made the cut, but each page of the book is a complete front page. More than reproduced headlines, we can read the seondary and teriary stories, see the pictures, and know the weather. My birth year, 1966 apparently was only a big deal to me, as nothing newsworthy enough made this book.<br />It is a hearty book, tall and wide. It is smaller than actual paper, and the body copy seems to have shrunk to about 6.5-7 pt. Printing methods were not as good in 1900, and you'll see the smudges in the ink as the plates wore throughout the day's printing. This makes intriguing history, but occasionally difficult reading.

It did not seem the researchers appreciated the subtleties defining the schools. It seems, for example, a school's Christian viewpoint skewed researcher's into a negative or less positive score, despite the otherwise top marks for SAT scores and so forth.<br />As a first look into the schools which you are interested in, this is useful, but the biases and mistakes in surveying hold back this from being a four-star book.<br />Instead, see the Peterson guide along the same lines.<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-10-21

She has a well-flavored take on her home country, making this an enjoyable and comprehensive book. There is more than paprika spicing up Hungarian people.<br /><br />While many guides to Hungarian culture are either long histories of various cities or ideas for tourism, \\"Culture Shock\\" provides the personality of the modern Hungarian.<br /><br />I looked for a comparable book and found none. This is the best introduction to Hungarian culture and etiquette on the market.<br /><br />To know a country, you must know the people. The sites and history don't cut it. There's the sociology, ideas and customs. Zsuzsanna Ardo provides us with everything from language pointers to how to do business, to core values.<br /><br />As far as the language section, you expect more than a traveller's lexicon. Look for an explantion of Hunglish (basically how Hungarians add their suffixes to English words to Hungarianize them). Learn how to articulate the variants in their complex vowel system, and how a slight slip can get you exactly what you didn't think you asked for. She explains the nuances of stress and unstressed syllables. There's a short etymology lesson too.<br /><br />Business, romance, and, of course, culinary matters are adequately surveyed.<br /><br />The details of Hungarian living are covered very well. Apparently, there's more to buying a watermelon there than here in the United States.Driving under the slightest influence of alcohol is warned against, as they've stricter rules than in the US. Buying a renting a home, what spas are all about, and what's really going with paprika is thoroughly discussed. The pulse of real living and how you can fit in is superbly introduced.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Culture Shock!: Hungary\\" by Zsuzsanna Ardo.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2002-10-19

There's good stuff here, as Olasky presents a remarkably balanced view of how the press presented the issue and practice of abortion from 1838-1988.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it stops at 1988. However, the quality of what is here is amazing, and is a great starting point for any media or historian hoping to understand what has been published on abortion.<br /><br />Detractors might brand Olasky as a conservative not doing an honest job to a topic requiring more than a slanted viewpoint to research the book. Those detractors would've missed this gem. Olasky worked with the abortion backers such as the National Abortion Federation and Planned Parenthood of NYC who provided access to much necessary documents. Similarly, he was able to find help from groups fighting abortion, like the Pro-Life Action League and Christian Action Council (founded by Billy Graham/C Everett Koop/OJ Brown). This support from both sides of the issue is unusual, and increases the value of \\"Press and Abortion.\\"<br /><br />Olasky begins with an assessment of things as they were in the early-mid 1800s. The now liberal Anglican, Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches were decisively against abortion. He cites from emphatic antiabortion statements by Wadworth (who became president at Harvard) and John Calvin to set the tone that America began, or at least was at that point in time, antiabortion.<br /><br />He generaly avoids consideration of the issue as a religious or moral matter, but merely shows how the press--largely the newspapers, but also some magazines--handled abortion as a news and editorial issue.<br /><br />Abortion began, he explains, in part, as a business decision by a couple placing ads in a major NY paper. They offered abortive services through a midwifery business, pretending to be physicians.<br /><br />Olasky slowly develops the chronology to indicate how the popular press was reconformed, as a whole, into a new ideology of campaigning for abortion, how physicians sold abortive services for $5. The NY Times went from pro-life to pro-choice, and he cites the massive percentage of articles they published for abortion (90%).<br /><br />He presents the public relation machine behind pro-choice organization, and the response of the \\"Detroit Free Press,\\" \\"Washington Post\\" and others.<br /><br />He highlights 1962 as a key year in pro-choice ideology, as the press seemed to make a large jump in writing stories about abortion clinic raids by the police, defining abortion as murder, and then decrying those who would deny abortions, claiming women needed liberating. Olasky discusses several important public events and editorials supporting this.<br /><br />Later, he talks about Dr. Bernard Nathanson, once the founder of the Nat'l Abortion Rights Action League, but who became so pro-life that he developed a film portraying the pain the fetus feels mid-abortion, and how various press reviewers dismissed the short documentary as not scientific. NARAL, feeling no doubt quite slighted, panned the film.<br /><br />Olasky finishes with some discussion of the fetal tissue transplant issue.<br /><br />It is documented very well, with over 40 pp in an annotated works cited list.<br /><br />Needed in an update are a timeline, explanation of what the stem cell issue is all about, and how the press has covered it.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Press and Abortion\\" by Marvin N.

Books like &quot;History of Modern Poetry: Modernism and After&quot; fill my bookshelves. I eat this stuff up. But one thing a lot of poetry books do is mush up the sense of it all in the hope of appealing to the academics. Since most regularly published poets are professors in English departments, it works out, but it creates a great divide between the laity and the academic.<br />What David Perkins has done is explain the basic chronology of poets periods. This is neither an encyclopedia of terms nor an anthology of great poems. Instead, Perkins takes a period, affiliates the poets major within that period and explains their context and importance.<br />He keeps it simple without talking down to the reader.<br />Essentially, it is a collection of intelligent essays. Some are topical, like &quot;The Postwar Period&quot; while others are poet-specific, like &quot;W. H. Auden.&quot;<br />Perkins writes clearly. It isn't trying to impress you, but he is trying to help you understand Eliot and onward.<br />I read it for personal growth, but it would make a solid textbook, in tandem with Perkins' other volume covering the previous eras.<br />I fully recommend &quot;History of Modern Poetry: Modernism and After&quot; by David Perkins.<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-10-16

He stood candidly, without the pretense that he was unaffected. He felt the same pain as anyone who lost people in the attacks. He lost his spiritual advisor--a priest, as well as others.<br /><br />Leading New York is akin to leading a blue whale. At a certain point, the whale chooses its own route. The mayor's job, in part, is about convincing the whale to go somewhere.<br /><br />Giuliani gained an unusual credibility about leadership ideas during and since the attacks. He had already proven himself as something more capable than LA's mayor as someone who could break out out mediocrity, and more visionary than Chicago's mayor as someone not content with merely maintaining. Giuliani raised the bar, and then jumped it well before September 11 catapulted him into new territory.<br /><br />Giuliani, like Bush, like any American leader, never trained or studied for what response was wisest during a national-level attack. They don't cover this in \\"how to be a leader\\" courses. Yet, like Bush, he improvised as best he knew and we saw what muster he could produce. Though almost out of office on September 11, he demonstrated he was not the lame duck a lesser man might've been.<br /><br />My trouble with a Giuliani-penned book is not in what he has to say about macro-leadership. He has the right stuff. But part of leadership is in the microleadership.<br /><br />His personal life publically flailed before our eyes. Granted, his struggle against prostrate cancer is impressive, and I hope in the long run, it is behind him. But his marital failure is scandalous. Bill Clinton's scandal was horrible, but Clinton was ashamed of himself as noted by his Adam and Eve like denials. Giuliani, however, didn't seem to have the same issues. I suspect he's not proud of himself, but, in turn, he seems to not be particularly penitent.<br /><br />I must recomend this book. It brings insight into a clearly complicated man.

Serious stuff. Many women die from it. Other women endure masectomies. Why make light of such a heavy topic? Simple: humor is healing.<br /><br />Laura Jensen Walker has something to say about breast cancer. She's a survivor. She has faced this beast, and now is able to articulately help readers smile in the midst of a tough time.<br /><br />In \\"Thanks for the Mammogram!\\" Jensen tells her story. Most of the book details a narrative of her diagnosis, treatment and how she survived. However, in reflecting through the most difficult of moments, she draws us in ala Erma Bombeck into candid silliness. It is as practical as it is funny.<br /><br />Boldly bringing humor into a discussion of cancer marks this book as a standout among its peers.

At a certain point, cancer is cancer, and anyone with any cancer would enjoy \\"Thanks for the Mammogram!\\"<br /><br />Each page is a different view of her situation. For example, she spends a delightful chapter on the end of her chemo, and how she and her husband (a 'Disnoid') celebrated this landmark at Disneyland. We read of her struggle to find a decent book to read (unless Mickey Mouse's various adventures appealed to an adult woman, that is).<br /><br />The chapters are in very chewable chunks--none too long.<br /><br />With chapters like, \\"To Baldly Go Where I've Never Gone Before\\" (a consideration of Capt. Jean Paul-Luc Picard, Michael Jordan and other sexy baldies, she looks for the upside of a hairless head), you, like me, might find a new way of seeing what so many people go through.<br /><br />She admits her fears, but pushes also the benefits of having a realistic, yet positive view of dealing with breast cancer. Jensen explains her husband's point of view in the whole matter (even letting him write a chapter, \\"Her Body, His Pain\\"). She walks the reader through the process, citing how she related to people who had or didn't have cancer.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Thanks for the Mammogram!\\" by Laura Jensen Walker.

Part of my dislike is wrought out of ignorance. I simply do not know what I'm doing. Cooking is also not a skill I have. I need help.<br /><br />Haley's Hints teaches me to cheat my way though a lot of household problems. He covers cleaning and cooking tips, but that's just the beginning.<br /><br />Like the old \\"Hints from Heloise\\" I read in the newspaper as a kid, Haley presents very do-able solutions to everyday problems. Unlike Martha Stewart's ideas, which seem unreasonable in the average income family, Haley seems to have considered the practicality of his hints quite aptly.<br /><br />Whether is it is hiding food odors, discouraging ants or his various methods of removing gum from things, he has a trick to it here in his well organized book.<br /><br />The guy is thorough. The sheer number of pages will provide plenty of ideas for your home. Besides making a great read for extended bathroom visits, it serves best as a reference. HThe index is impressive and easy to use.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Haley's Hints: A Compilation\\" by Graham Haley.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2002-08-26

His emphasis on the military side of terrorism, as opposed to a few radicals will be alarming. His analysis of various US civil and international wars and conflicts isn't pretty, and, on such a short book, not easily agreed with at face value. Still, he forces the reader to see past the result of the war, and see the process of war with moral and ethical truth, one way or another.<br />It is a frustratingly short book, but necessary nonetheless. His points are substantiated, but with his thesis so broad-stroking, it would be good, if in subsequent editions he likewise broadens his support of these points. Timelines, charts, tables all would help.<br />Just the same, Carr courageously asserts that terrorism is not unique to foreign political and miliary entities. He tries to avoid the public relations skews that we have put on our own actions. Boldly, his is unafraid to say what both liberals and conservatives already are too keenly cognizant of, that we've not always played wargames fairly.<br />Don't accept Carr at his word, nor expect to agree with every argument. I certainly don't. I do agree, however, that we need to consider the defining and perspective of terrorism with a honest look at what the US has done and is doing.<br />I fully recommend &quot;The Lessons of Terror: A History of Warfare Against Civilians: Why It Has Always Failed and Why It Will Fail Again&quot; by Caleb Carr.<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-08-24

It lacks wit, I know, but it is loaded with truth. My score went up considerably after cramming with this book. I hope your score does as well.<br />There are two kinds of people who take the Graduate Record Examination... well, three, actually: Those who don't study for the GRE, those who take a course costing several hundred dollars, and those of us buying a book or two. Buy &quot;Crash Course for the GRE.&quot; It is what you need.<br />I suspect those who take the courses get their money's worth. However, &quot;Crash Course for the GRE&quot; is a much cheaper, quicker solution. It cuts to the chase, tells you what you need to know, and shows you how to figure out those algebra problems better than your high school freshman year teacher.<br />They teach you how to be organized during the test. And you'll learn how to draw sensible charts for the logic portion. This will save you precious time as you realize you have no clue how to answer number 27. It teach you how to effectively guess.<br />I took the GRE. I used the Princeton Review. I crammed. Sure, sure--not the best approach for an important exam, but the fact remains, I'm not alone. Effective cramming involves knowing what to jettison, and what to keep on board. That is, knowing what is important to focus on. The Princeton Review folks know this.<br />I dreaded the math portion. If I told you how low my high school grades were for math, and then told you my GRE score, you'd likely believe neither. But it is true. My score rocked. Why? The easy teaching style of &quot;Crash Course for the GRE.&quot; The MIT admissions people wouldn't be impressed, but for a guy with a literature degree looking to get into a marketing communications program, the &quot;Crash Course for the GRE&quot; helped me get the math score I needed.<br />Have I convinced you?

He knows we don't want to die alone, like Eleanor Rigby of the old Beatles tune. Zukav knows we want to matter to others and to ourselves. It is that core insecurity that sells this book. He implies he has the answer.<br /><br />In \\"The Heart of the Soul: Emotional Awareness,\\" Zukav mixes various religious points of view and trues to create a new paradigm. Like any self-help book, he tries to toss around a mew vocabulary to distinguish his thoughts from, say, Tolle or Myss. Zukav's book makes it sound as if he himself has invented God.<br /><br />The goal presented readers is spiritual development. Why? No real reason, except for self-serving ons. Zukav leads readers into the same self-serving trap he condemns them for, only this time with a spiritual spin.<br /><br />Spiritual development is a fine aspiration, but Zukav manages to pervert what this means, corrupting the message of his book into just another money-making Pied Piper-ized search for ourselves.<br /><br />All the lonely people might rush out to buy this one, but I don't recommend it, not for you, or for Eleanor Rigby. Seek first the kingdom of God, but don't expect Zukov to show you the way.

Eugene Peterson has earned a reputation of being a studious, yet acessible scholar, presenting Scriptural truth before the everyday Christian.<br /><br />Compare this with Tyndale House Publishers' \\"The Living Bible,\\" the best known paraphrase, or, the lesser known but very popular \\"Amplified Bible.\\" All reach a believer with different reading levels and expertise.<br /><br />Read alone, \\"The Message\\" might not be a great move. That would be like hearing a preacher without having a Bible open to see if he knows what he's talking about.<br /><br />Peterson has done Scripture justice by translating it directly from the original languages. It has not been filtered from Greek to Latin to English, but from Greek, and from Hebrew. This matters, as it keeps the reader closer to what was originally intended.<br /><br />For the casual, or nonbelieving reader, this will help bring them up to speed on what the Bible is about. The Bible, in its various forms, is among the most purchased and least read, and the most criticized and least read. This will help those readers actually read it.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language\\" by Eugene Peterson, and hope you buy it in tandem with another Bible, like the \\"New American Standard Version\\" or \\"New International Version.\\" They are also in modern English.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2002-08-04

Give a chance to think twice, who knows what they might've done. But they thought once, did what needed to be done, and showed us the spirit of Paul Revere is not lost in the late 1700s, but is awake in this generation. And that the valor of Bunker Hill, the courage of men who did not shoot until they saw the whites of their opponents' eyes... Beamer and company pressed through the odds against their success. Not just Beamer, though he is now the best known of the heroic team.<br /><br />In forcing a plane to crash, they raised the American flag higher into the sky than it had seen in many decades. And, in the case of Beamer, it showed that a man of deep Christian faith was willing to give his life that others may live, an example for all Christians worldwide.<br /><br />The details of the book bring reality to a story too easy to make into a myth. There was a real plane over a real field, and real people hijacked it, and real people were killed in the process.

The rest of us are dependent on a myriad of study tools if we intend to get something about 500. That's \\"10 Real SATs\\" is required for any high school student.<br /><br />This book won't bring you from a 700 to an 800. That is more about the last ten years of school, and how good your teachers have been. But it can assist in going from a 600 to a 700, or even a 450 to a 600. Those numbers make a difference between a mediocre college and a top university.<br /><br />Part of doing well in any test or competition is knowing what's ahead of you. What better way than practice tests? You'll see where your weak areas are, and how long certain questions take you.<br /><br />For example, when I took the GRE (like the SAT in many ways), I was convinced my best score would come from the verbal portion, and my worst score would come from the math section. The opposite was true. The verbal section took longer for me, as I considered each question thoroughly. Not being a math whiz, I was able to see quickly which question I couldn't answer, and dwelt on the ones I knew. The math section went better because I knew my limitations better, and thus, balanced my time better. You'll learn this kind of thing from taking these tests.<br /><br />Taking ten SAT tests doesn't seem like fun. It isn't.

There are a few names in athletics that define a sport, and, in a bigger sense, define all sports. Lance Armstrong, in what is a relatively small sport in America, has succeeded to be able to able his place among the greatest ever.<br /><br />Had Armstrong not had cancer, it would not have made him a lesser athlete. He might have more victories behind him. But with his struggle with cancer, he has been vaulted beyond being a great biker, winner of several Tour de France yellow jerseys. He has become a great man.<br /><br />As a biker, I know any Tour de France victory is extraordinary. These guys are as tough as any rugby player. To win it multiple times seem impossible, but Armstrong has the bragging rights. However, this book is not filled with self-congratulating phrases or business book mantras. It is a challenge to reach the top of your game.<br /><br />Furthermore, he has been unafraid to exercise his free speech. He has opinions, and does not cater to the media. Yet, unlike too many athletes, he has something to say. Armstrong has not let his victories be stained by drugs or crime. He is that quintessential All American Good Guy.<br /><br />If kids watch Armstrong, they can want to be like him. Parents will not be ashamed of him. High school kids can read this book (even nonbikers) and feel a sense of drive to press onward, to get the job done, to not lose hope no matter how dire things seem. Armstrong pressed on, and now, as I write, he is on his way to winning another yellow jersey.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"It's Not About the Bike\\" by Lance Armstrong.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />anthonytrendl.com<br /><br />update: This review was published before the scandalous news about Mr. Armstrong came out.

But we who collect rejection notices from our favorite publishers as if it were a hobby will connect with King's look back at leaner years.<br />Now, as he can sell a book merely be the merit of his name, he might've forgotten how hard it was in the beginning.<br />King recounts anecdote after anecdote of his efforts to get various horror magazines to buy his stuff. And when they did, he was elated. Why shouldn't he? He got paid to create something from nothing. Getting paid for writing is like printing money and getting away with it.<br />For the writer, who, like I, esteems to have a shelf filled with books with our name printed on the spine, read &quot;On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft.&quot; Through this book, King brings to life not some creature from the deep beyond, but the reminder that great writing, no matter the genre (and I must admit, King raises the bar of his genre), perseverence is the trick.

There is a section with open-ended questions, so that the message of the story can come through more clearly.<br />In short, it is an incredible teaching tool.<br />It is whimsical, yet insightful. Occassionally lapsing into stream of consciousness, Washington's style will draw in girls who will connect. Those of us familiar with the old Beverly Cleary books will find the approach appealing.<br />Though Washington has created a great text, the pictures share the center. Julie Chen understands what journals are all about, and has doodles throughout each page. The development of the book, in fact, is assisted so much with the pictures that young readers will likely stay on each page a little longer. As they explore each drawing, and wonder how it connects, they realize a bit more what Mel is going through.<br />Showing a drawn picture of a frumpy, out of style Sunday school teacher, Mel writes, \\"Mrs. Wells, my Sunday school teacher, was like, 'Do you want to pray THE PRAYER?'\\" The quote is in a cartoon bubble, and the \\"The Prayer\\" is an Old English style script. Anyone who has been part of a protestant church knows the prayer!<br />Mel continues on to discover what Christianity really is about, and how it isn't easy.

Unlike many chess players, I only own a few.<br /><br />It begins with the elements of chess: the pieces, how they move, and the essential advantages and disadvantages of positions the player will likely find himself in. Curiously, Lasker discusses the square. All of chess revolves about going from one square to another, and Lasker presumes (rightly so, i believe) that to know the end well, the player must see the very beginning at its core.<br /><br />He goes on to explain the why and what-fors about openings. He presents the opening concept both as a theory to muse over, and as a practical matter of setting things in such a way as to increase your likelihood of winning. He explains \\"Sortez les pieces\\" (Get the pieces out), and other 'rules' of chess.<br /><br />Like a Mark Twain book review, he feels in complete candor permission to question 'compilers', those players who memorize every variation of boardplay and win by the ability to study. He contrasts these players with those with natural talent, who he apreciates much more.<br /><br />Lasker walks through each step of the major openings in a clear manner, unlike some of the fuzzy chess primers written by modern masters.<br /><br />If fencing is played like chess, it could also be said chess is played like fencing. Lasker comments in the next section about the combinations, and suggestion chess is replete with violence, countered effectively by more violence, all brutal and seething with imminent danger. He provides, among others, an example of a check to the queen by a pawn.<br /><br />In the combinations section, he looks at variation predicaments great players he has encountered have wandered into, and how they pulled out these situations victoriously.<br /><br />Later, he goes through various positions, even the aesthetics effects of chess.<br /><br />\\"Lasker's Manual of Chess\\" by Emanuel Lasker is a great book for a high school level or above player to explore.

The trick is to hire the right person, beyond whatever criteria the &quot;how to hire the people&quot; sorts of books pontificate. Hire the right person, and the job gets done well. Hire enough of the right people, and you've got yourself a pretty good company.<br />They explain how and why. Great experience is valued less than great talent. Buckingham and Coffman assert you'll get what you pay for, and you'll get what you expect.<br />They keep it simple and ariculate it in lists, as you'd expect from a business book.<br />They've based this on a ridiculous amount of research. Don't think that that makes the ideas fool-proof. It only means 80,000 people have offered their thoughts, and, when combined with the authors' own experiences, this is the result. You need to apply these ideas, and not be held back by another's success.<br />It boils down to profit, but this is based on quality productivity from skilled employees under smart managers. If being a smart manager is your goal, a quick read through &quot;First, Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently&quot; is what I recommend.<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-06-21

Rather than write something and then see who will buy it, he suggests to turn that around. Who is buying what, and can I write it? This kind of critical thinking will produce more focused, stronger writing, and can enable you to sell your work.<br />As he has been the editor of a magazine read by almost two millions readers each month, he knows what editors want and what makes good writing. He presents this in a very well-organized, succinct text. Covering legal and ethic issues, and how to consider rejections, and what the life of a discplined writer is all about, Palms' book will encourage and push the Christian writer to move forward in a sensible way.<br />A perfect companion book would be &quot;Christian Writers' Market Guide 2002: The Reference Tool for the Christian Writer (Christian Writers' Market Guide)&quot; by Sally Stuart, an annual directory of Christian publications.<br />I fully recommend &quot;Effective Magazine Writing: Let Your Words Reach the World&quot; by Roger C.

Michael Moore gives us plenty of both in \\"Stupid White Men ...and Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation!\\" It really doesn't matter which is which, because either way, Moore has the reader laughing and wondering. Expect your feathers to be ruffled whether you are a Republican or a Democrat.<br />When he says, \\"We need Jimmy Carter,\\" to respond to a major crisis, you know he's not entirely serious.<br />Someplace between Bill Maher and Rush Limbaugh is Michael Moore. Neither of those guys claims to be a Harvard political scholar, and both acknowledge taking a point of view for the sake of entertainment. But you and I both know Limbaugh is particularly right wing, and Maher is unashamedly left wing. Such is Moore, with a keen look at the views from both sides, but has his tongue clearly placed in his cheek. He manages to put both sides in their place.<br />It is a bit difficult to be sure if he is making Democrats or Republicans look more stupid. It seems, instead, he points more at you and me, and our fascination with the gossip of Washington more than the the content. He goads and taunts the reader in a playful, but accurate way. For example, he calls Bill Clinton one of the best Republican presidents... which party should be more offended?<br />I fully recommend \\"Stupid White Men ...and Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation!\\" by Michael Moore.<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-06-18

And on a more fictional level, so did Alger: opportunity exists for those who chase it. Sandburg said it occasionally in his poems: the city is built of girders that are the men who built them. So why another book on America? Why &quot;What's So Great About America&quot;?<br />The reason is clear. Most people haven't read Rousseau, de Tocqueville, Alger or Sandburg. Moreover, Dinesh D'Souza brings a command of English that draws in the reader who might not know history or current events. He is funny... more witty than humorous... and points fingers at both conservatives and liberals.<br />The patriotic bandwagon has hit America, and my bet is that mostly Reagan patriots will buy this book. D'Souza seems to lean that way himself. More liberal leaning people will shake their heads at the book, thinking it fluff, and to some degree, rightly so. It is far from as academic as Rousseau: it is a mix between watching a Fourth of July rally and an ACLU dialogue about freedoms.<br />D'Souza's Indian heritage gives him the kind of credibility my grandmother had as she appreciated America (she was from eastern Europe). He has seen the rest of the world, and India was once his home. He has tasted freedom in ways those of us who grew here do not know.<br />I fully recommend &quot;What's So Great About America&quot; by Dinesh D'Souza.<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-06-14

The restaurant foods you love do not love you.<br /><br />It might be said Michael Jacobson is taking the fun out of eating. Maybe so, but he is introducing honesty. Just because waffles seem like a good ol' traditional meal does not mean it is good for you.<br /><br />Eat out? I do, as often as I can. My budget limits me to the big chains, not the speciality restaurants. As I examine the different chains' offerings, as described by Jacobson, I realize my diet is not as healthy as I once believed. I'm not referring to the obvious diet killers: McDonald's and Burger King, but to Olive Garden and other well-known places to dine.<br /><br />He compares, for example, how some waffles are worse than a big steak. He hardly is advocating that a steak is healthy, but it showing how fatty, how sugary basic breakfast food can be.<br /><br />He goes dish by typical dish, analyzing the good and bad, and sums up in a line or two if that dish is what you should be eating.<br /><br />It is a saddening expose. It is a free country, so choose what you will eat, but with this book, you can choose more wisely, and think about the big picture of your diet more accurately.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Restaurant Confidential\\" by Michael F.

I do think Eckhart Tolle's book presents ideas which insult the thinking meditatively inclined reader.<br />As a starting point for someone who has never considered philosophical thought before, this book might be intriguing. Like Deepak Chopra, there are curious nuggets of interesting ideas, but, also like Chopra the depth stops on a dime.<br />Tolle seems more interested in stopping pain than pursuing wholeness. The absence of pain does not necessarily mean the presence of happiness, and the presence of happiness does not necessarily mean the presence of contentment.<br />Tolle believes the truth self is the deepest self, whereas believers in a diety-based religion realize the deepest truth is found outside of ourselves, in God. Many people might argue which God is the true God, of course, but Tolle shortsightedly and arrogantly implies there is not God but ourselves.<br />Any value found in Tolle's book is the challenge to stop, relax and focus through the mired confusion around us. It is diificult to discover truth with a myriad of life's event flurrying around, and Tolle is right to suggest we stop, breathe and ask what is truth. These are old concepts explained well by Tolle, but they are only the beginning.<br />For a meditative book, try \\"My Utmost for His Highest\\" by Oswald Chamber, or anything by Thomas Kempis.<br />I cautiously recommend \\"The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment\\" by Eckhart Tolle.<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-06-13

To get the job done, all are necessary. Anemia and apathy can suck a company dry, especially one entrenched in corporate culture. The good company, authors Ram Charan and Larry Bossidy say, executes with success because they've hired people who understand, \\"Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done.\\" No, not the book, per se, but the principles in the book. The book has this principles clearly laid-out.<br />The challenge in reviewing this book is that it is packed beyond the usual business book with the meat of what differentiates the \\"could've been great leader\\" from the \\"guy who did it.\\" Doing is what matters. Without getting things done, and done right, change can never exist, and profits will eventually slide.<br />Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan have the credentials, and more importantly, the results that justify this book. He took Allied Signal to the top. Not only did he receive awards and such, but he has the numbers... the profits and stock value improvements to show he knows how to run the show. Charan's been an advisor to the major companies, and has taught at the nation's most impressive institutions.<br />While Allied Signal is huge, the little guy will benefit from this as well. Own a coffeeshop? A hobby store? Business is business and what Bossidy has to say will help you too.<br />Why let the manager make the calls to check references for the assistant manager? The assistant is a key hire, and your shop depends on him. Make those calls yourself, just as Bossidy did at his company. Be sure the right person is in place for each position. Acquring the best and brightest does not only refer to hiring a six figure CFO, but a $30K program manager, or activities director.<br />Passivity and corporate anarchy are not the foundation of a company which intends to complete its goals. Charan & Bossidy is sure to point out about being part of and influencing decisions which matter, and being prepared to make those decisions.

In &quot;Bringing Up Boys,&quot; he gets his message across.<br />What is his message? It isn't very complicated: Focus on rearing your son with love and with Christian principles, and you'll do a lot of good for him as he becomes an adult.<br />Not unlike &quot;Crisis in Masculinity&quot; by Leanne Payne, Dobson asserts masculinity can be encouraged, and should be fostered, and with Christ as the center of your family, things have more hope.<br />Granted, the book is not for everyone. He says a few bold things that might make a nonChristian cringe. He doesn't shy from or water down his Christian beliefs, but, just like any parenting book, his worldview influences his ideas, whether liberal or conservative. Consider that a caveat, and with Dobson's reputation with Focus on the Family, no reader will likely be suprised as he integrates his faith with his psychology.<br />While &quot;Bringing Up Boys&quot; is not the last word in parenting boys, it is a place to consider some tough ideas, and react to what Dobson states. He unapologetically refutes and denounces some popular thoughts on modern psychology, and gives plenty of things to consider.<br />For the reader willing to be challenged, or for those readers who are fans of Dobson, Focus and desire to learn some pragmatic thoughts on parenting boys, I fully recommend &quot;Bringing Up Boys: Practical Advice and Encouragement for Those Shaping the Next Generation of Men&quot; by James Dobson.<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-06-07

In &quot;Once Upon a Town: The Miracle of the North Platte Canteen&quot; Greene brings out the humanity of a small, almost forgotten town in the flats of Nebraska.<br />Across the world, America was fighting in a war, and in America, men were kissing girlfriends and hugging parents good-bye. Some didn't live to come back. In between the tragedy of war, and the sadness of leaving home was North Platte, a town which just happened to be where trains full of soldiers stopped briefly to reload supplies. In WWII the town was booming with commerce, as much as any small town might boom with anything.<br />Merely being a significant stop might be a story enough, but Greene goes deeper than the train stop, and into the core heart of the town. He discovers the great strides the community made to welcome the soldiers. The soldiers came from places just like North Platte, and most would've given anything to stay home. Duty called them to the war, and North Platte did everything they could to help them get there.<br />Whether is was the food and kind words, or just the friendship offered, the hospitality North Platte provided extended well beyond the expectations of the usual train stop.<br />Bob Greene describes the town with color and excitement, and brings us back 60 years. As now, with America again sending young men and women to the front of a complex, violent war, Greene's testimonial of the goodness of one community might spur us on to do likewise, in the context in which we live.<br />I fully recommend &quot;Once Upon a Town: The Miracle of the North Platte Canteen&quot; by Bob Greene.<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-06-07

Politicians too.<br /><br />Summing up the conflict to mere politics, or simple economics would be foolish, as would solely blaming this side or that. The religious aspect in the matter is strong from all sides. Each side, naturally, has a viewpoint, and these viewpoints many individuals are willing to die for. Why? Bard sorts it out.<br /><br />It is a bit academic, and the faint of mind might want to steer clear, but, at the same time, Bard keeps it as well-said as possible. It is a difficult topic, and in just a few hundred pages he puts into perspective what has taken hundreds of years... thousands, in the case of Israel, to unravel. A lot of malarkey is out there, built on propaganda, misinformation, prejudice and lack of research, but Bard brings it together, and helps the reader know the truth from the hooey.<br /><br />This is hardly the last word on the Arab-Israeli conflict, but it is a very rich start.

Timmerman will polarize an already polarized public. No one is passive about their assessment of Jesse Jackson.<br />I don't fully agree with what Timmerman presents, but I do think he has asked that readers think more deeply than Jackson's well-said sound bites about whether or not Jesse Jackson should have the leadership influence he enjoys.<br />The Pat Buchanan/Rush Limbaugh crowd will love this book, but it'll preach to the chior. The question other readers will be challenged by is how accurate is Timmerman's examination of an already controversial man?<br />There is a lot going on here, but some things the book caused me to consider:<br />* Many in the Christian community do not consider him a valid spokesperson of the faith. He seems to speak more about social issues than Jesus Christ from the pulpit, creating concern that his title of 'reverend' is more for political convenience than spiritual authority.<br />* Many in the African-American community have a love-hate relationship with Jackson, knowing he speaks up for them more effectively than, say, Farrakhan. But they also see Jackson grab hold of issues that seem like self-indulgent, fundraising-fodder grandstanding, like his embarrassing support of the kids who started a brawl in Decatur, IL.<br />* Likewise complex is what various women's rights group must respond to. As Jackson has, at least since he changed his position in the 1960s, heavily supported abortion rights, he also admitted to cheating on his wife. This mired life makes support for Jackson not as simple as it once was.<br />Timmerman might seem bitter about what Jackson has represented himself as, and this will push away political and social liberals. In fact, any supporter of Jackson will likely say the book is unfounded, and filled with contrary 'facts'. Just the same, must the baby be thrown out with the bathwater? If Timmerman's findings are true in any regard, what response should Jackson supporters have?<br />I fully recommend \\"Shakedown: Exposing the Real Jesse Jackson.\\"<br />Anthony Trendluld Jackson supporters have?<br />I fully recommend \\"Shakedown: Exposing the Real Jesse Jackson.\\"<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-03-12

GWB has lived a paradoxical life, and we've gotten the good with the bad.

And I learned some things the priest in our Chicagoland parish was not teaching Catholic doctrine.<br /><br />Whether you are Catholic or not, there is a fair chance you've bought into some of what pop-culture has said Catholic is and is not. This easy-to-read (thick, but well-organized) book will give you the Catholic position on the matter.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Catechism of the Catholic Church.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />americanspeechwriter.com	2002-01-21

You know, the kind of guy or gal who has no intention of finding anything specfically, but will hunker down and read what others consider reference.<br />Reference, schmeference! Dictionaries are not mean for bookshleves, but to be devoured and enjoyed! And with the &quot;Readers Digest Illustrated Reverse Dictionary&quot; you get a great book to do that with.<br />On one hand, it acts like the standard dictionaries. Look up a word, get a definition. It goes beyond this, though. Rather than getting bogged down by linguistics and pronuciation indexes, you'll be greeted by a bevy of charts and lists organizing words. It isn't quite a thesaurus, but it isn't a dictionary either. It is somewhere in-between, and something new in the midst of it all.<br />For those among us smitten by words and all the curiosity that goes with them, this is a book to feast on.<br />Be assured that the &quot;Illustrated Reverse Dictionary&quot; won't be the only dictionary you'll need. Far from it, but it is a lot of fun.<br />There are other great dictionaries to be reckoned with, from &quot;The New Oxford American Dictionary,&quot; which defines words with clarity, to the big kahuna of them all, to the highly unusual &quot;The Highly Selective Dictionary for the Extraordinarily Literate.&quot;<br />Then there is the collection of esoteric but high-scoring words, the &quot;Scrabble Dictionary,&quot; to the mighty &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (see my reviews on these elsewhere on Amazon). There is a wily world of wondrous words wisping whist you read... go get them!<br />I fully recommend &quot;Readers Digest Illustrated Reverse Dictionary.&quot;<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-01-18

Instead, Collins gives us genuine research, genuine examples. In connecting today's great leaders from the past, he says plainly, &quot;We're no different from people in the 1500s.&quot;<br />Puffing up many a CEO's bookshelf are books of avante gard management techniques. It is as if whoever knows the most chic terms for change management will win the race.<br />&quot;Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't&quot; isn't avante gard.

Readers go from &quot;Catcher&quot; to Kerouac's &quot;On the Road,&quot; with the same easy-going, streaming thoughts kind of way.<br />&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; grabs at the introspective self.

Burroughs&quot; might be more than most readers interested in the Beats might care to read. However, if you find the life of a writer as intriguing as his writings, you'll love this.<br />As a student of the Beat style (particularly how Kerouac merged poets into music), I was curious to learn more about the people of the movement.<br />&quot;Conversations With William S. Burroughs&quot; feeds into the pretensions of Burroughs' personality. There's the obvious cross-pollinating in here, showing how Corso, Ginsberg, Ferlingetti, Kerouac all fed each other compliments. Owning a lot of the pop-philosphy which eventually ruined the Beats... discussing issues he didn't care about in 'real life'. It is hard to tell what Burroughs finds interesting, and what he really believed in.<br />This isn't the best you'll read on Burroughs, but it is essential to get into the full look of the writer's pensive life. He seems more introspective than his counterparts, but just as politically-minded.<br />I recommend &quot;Conversations With William S. Burroughs.&quot;<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-01-14

Buy it, though, not because of a New Year's resolution, but because you want to lose weight. Buy it as if you would have bought it in July.<br />Greene's phased approach keeps things realistic. While it is true that your lifestyle must change, it is also true that even if only phase one is complete, you'll be better off. However, each phase not only adds to the previous phase, but multiplies the effect. Intensity increases, and the quality of fitness will increase.<br />Starting is easy. Finishing is hard. Greene is positive and honest, and recognizes that there is more to fitness than eating right and exercise. He avoids the self-help mantras that most of us have mumbled in futility. His system of tracking results will encourage you as you see things improve.<br />I fully recommend &quot;Get With the Program.&quot; And when you buy it, follow-through. In July, you'll be recommending the book!<br />Anthony Trendl	2002-01-04

Broken down by Dr. Garton, these slogans are seen in their proper light, as fear-mongering mantras designed by people who are not concerned with her or her unborn baby.<br />Dr. Garton presents to women that they do have a choice, and shows them how they are being manipulated. Similarly, the media might not have had time to think about this bumper-sticker statements, but \\"Who Broke the Baby?\\" gives reporters a chance to know how they are being used.<br />Yes, there are a lot of issues that are complex for a mother to be to deal with. There is no denying the financial and logistical troubles she may face... but confusing her with the muddled thinking of men and women who think having childen is an insult to femininity is not the answer.<br />Recommended by C Everett Koop, and consistent with the theologies of both evangelicals and Catholics, Dr. Garton's book transcends denominations as she herself is part of mainline protestants, a Lutheran.<br />I fully recommend \\"Who Broke the Baby?\\" by Jean Staker Garton.<br />Anthony Trendl	2001-12-08

John Grisham's &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; shows he is more than an author of legal thrillers. As a fan of &quot;The Pelican Brief,&quot; I wondered if he could pull off a Christmas book. He has pulled it off.<br />&quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is not Charles Dickens. Still, he grabs at the reader to consider the important of Christmas, and jabs at the superficiality of the typical Christmas protocols.<br />Never disregarding the true values of Christmas, Grisham wields his pen through a terrific tale of parody and fiction, so close to the reality many of us face durinf the holiday season.<br />So, as you rush out to the mall to buy the sausage sampler for your Uncle Lou, dropping by the hardware store for some outlet multipliers for your tree lights, pick up a copy of &quot;Skipping Christmas.&quot;<br />I fully recommend &quot;Skipping Christmas.&quot;<br />Anthony Trendl	2001-12-04

Edward has great television charisma, and here, presents his ideas as smoothly as a MLM seminar leader, but none of this lends true credibility to his thoughts on psychic powers.<br />He sounds just a step away from chasing comets and space ships in a pair of Nikes. Cynical am I? You betcha. I was expecting a more serious, scientific look at mystical psychic powers, when instead I experienced something closer to meaningless drabble.<br />His discussion of auras and psychics powers, and how we can use them to protect us and help us is not only unfounded, but refutable in every aspect.<br />Edward here is appealing to the gut instinct we all have for spirituality. We want to know the depths of the mind, especially as it relates to a diety, whether internal or external. That gut instinct is where he makes his sale, akin to snake oil. We want the spiritual cure for our broken souls, and will drink anything articulately declared to be that cure.<br />In an age dismissing traditional religions, Edward comes along feeding oil to those who need nutrition.<br />I applaud Edward for pursuing the supernatural psychic realm, but I think he is teasing his audience into thinking he is delivering facts and meat. He has categorically rejected the deep meditative spirituality, for example, of the Middle Ages Christian thought. He seems to be close minded about other religions.<br />I do not recommend \\"Developing Your Own Psychic Powers.\\"<br />Save some money and, for the open-minded, buy something by Thomas a' Kempis, or Oswald Chambers.<br />Anthony Trendl	2001-11-28

Probably... while you agree	So my title sounds goofy. However, &quot;Willow Creek Seeker Services: Evaluating a New Way of Doing Church&quot; by Dr. Gregory A. Pritchard solidly examines the processes of an internationally influential church. Churches across the world, of all denominations, are utilizing Willow Creek's ideas.<br />Dr. Pritchard, with his background as a adjunct professor at acclaimed schools like Wheaton College, and executive director of a communications institute/think tank, has established credentials in the field of contemporary church leadership analysis.<br />Willow Creek Community Church, for all the fame it enjoys, is also controversial for its leadership methods and for its contemporary-style worship.<br />Does Willow Creek Community Church water down its message? Or is it showing the Christian Church (Catholics included) a new way of thinking about church and its members?<br />Does its leadership development resemble the MLM/Amway method of raising up the shining stars... the quarterbacks and class presidents... to develop followers drawn to beautiful people?<br />No one can say Willow Creek Community Church isn't leading people to the Lord. Despite being in an extremely affluent community, it addresses aggressively pride, greed, materialism and lust. But by what model should a church follow?<br />Dr. Pritchard looks at both sides. Willow Creek leaders themselves will likely applaud and be frustrated by the truth of this evaluation. Detractors of Willow Creek will see the complexity of the church's mission and the successes, while acknowledging the clear struggles faced by such a megachurch.<br />In all, &quot;Willow Creek Seeker Services: Evaluating a New Way of Doing Church&quot; is valuable food for thought. Starting a Willow Creek-style church? Consider some of the dilemmas this puts you in. Rejecting the ideas presented by your pro-Willow Creek elders?

Backing what she believed was a growing acceptance of eugenics, that to have a better world, the population needed to be genetically purer. For Sanger, not too different that Hitler, this meant encouraging abortions among African-Americans.<br /><br />To read Sanger's auto-biography alone might mislead the reader into believing her views were founded in cleanly laid-out welfare theories and of women's rights. That was part of it... but deeper still... and the reason I'm not comfortable fully recommending this book... is her core racial prejudice under the guise of freedom.<br /><br />I understand my review might offend fans of Sanger, but read it in context.<br /><br />Pick up George Grant's book on it... get past his over-emphasis on his own conservative views, and read his analysis of her own comments. Better yet... if you can find one, read Doug Scott's \\"Bad Choices\\" expose of the founding  and practices of Planned Parenthood. Again, exceedingly conservative and not for the close-minded, but his citations of Sanger's letters and official documents are astounding and alarming.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />[...]	2001-10-17

Finishing it more a matter of time than struggle.<br />Granted, Steinbeck's description of the immense dust overtaking Oklahoma might seem overdone, but it sets the environment from which Tom Joad is leaving. It puts the grape fields in perspective.<br />Read &quot;Cliff Notes&quot; if you're in a jam, and need to get the gist of the real book in your system. However, if you have the time, read all 600+ pages of Steinbeck's magnificent story.

Instead, once the dust blows away, we have post-Depression Oklahoma, and WWII, and today.<br />The struggle of Joad is not just his struggle in a hard time, but the same perseverence through adversity faced by Carl Sandburg's characters in his &quot;Chicago Poems,&quot; in Dicken's &quot;Bleak House&quot; and in Billy Joel's song, &quot;Allentown.&quot; Tough times are universal, no matter the environment.<br />Complex situations wrought hard decisions by Joad and his family.

Boiled down, in one respect, is the question of what makes a true Christianity, the sort who has as much integrity as claimed. Living as Christ would live is a high standard, and Hawthorne demonstrates the multi-layered issues fallible people deal with.<br />True to the genre and period of writing, Hawthorne is as much of a character as the ones he writes about. While today's novels are embroiled in myopic first person narratives, &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; enjoys the psychological unravelling of characters through analysis, observation and deduction.<br />&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; asks questions we no longer ask, and draws out intrigue as the reader page-by-page wonders what is the best response to a Christian woman who has given birth outside of wedlock, and what response is appropriate for the dodging minister.

These are well-written, and intensely exciting. Far better to read HP than most of of the other boy-hero books. And the usual lot: Goosebumps and the rest are just a literary waste of time. However, I'm disappointed in some of the more diabolical characters. Be sure to discuss this with your more impressionable children.<br />In all, the Harry Potter books are intelligent. For the kids who think the Babysitters Club or Goosebumps are the best the world, start with Harry. Then work your way over on the shelf to read the Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis, and for real depth of plot and storyline, see JRR Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot;<br />Due to the heavy commercialization of the HP books, I doubt HP will make into the ranks of classic books. They'll be, sadly, too diluted with pop-culture to make it. But for today, they'll serve as a nice segue into the classics.<br />Buy it, but with the caveat there are better books in this genre.	2001-07-09

Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book.<br /><br />In \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life.<br /><br />Of course, \\"Old Man,\\" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy.<br /><br />A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?<br /><br />As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2001-06-29

Despite being an unorthodox pair, they are family... and Rob brings them together like a dad... a bit hands-off, but always right there, smugly happy he is human.<br />Bucky only wants to live a cat's life, and Satchel, only wants to live the life of a dog. Neither realizes what drives the other, and stays back when the other is about to do something silly doing to his species.<br />I fully recommend this book.

I wondered a little about the beginning, with the whole Adam and Eve thing... I thought to myself, \\"If this book is going to be about two naked people running around a garden naming animals all day, I might be bored.\\"<br />Then, wham! They ate some bad fruit, were kicked out, one of their kids killed the other. Later on, there was a big flood, a father (Abraham) almost kills his son when God tels him to (God tells Abe to stop at the last second).<br />There's this whole thing about David who starts off by killing a guy several times bigger than him with a tiny stone. He goes on to become king, and has ... with somebody else's wife and gets in huge trouble with God. David wrote some poems about it, mostly about how God meant business, and still forgave him.<br />The story picks up as far as easy to read narrative stuff, much of which is in the form of letters by different guys to churches and old friends. A guy named Jesus is born who, instead of a last name, uses a title to as a surname. Goes by Jesus Christ, which means, \\"Jesus, the Anointed One.\\" Seems he is both God and a man, 100% of each. This whole part is cool, on account he can do whatever he needs to do.<br />One time, when in a jam, Jesus makes a few fish and a little bit of bread into a ton of it, feeding a massive crowd. All this is not the story, though. The real conflict is when Jesus has a run in with some people who feel put-off that he claims to be God. They believed in God, and all, but they were expecting someone flashier. Instead, they got an ordinary looking Joe, the son of a tradesman. Jesus would tell them he wasn't God, so these people killed him.<br />The whole section where they kill Jesus is pretty exciting, loaded with dramatic lines, as well as subtle comments from Jesus noone understands at first. One of his buddies gives him the kiss of death. He tells them, basically, that he's going to die, but that he'll rise from the dead. And he pulls it off. Freaks out his friends, of course, especially Thomas who sees him plain as day, but thinks he is a ghost.<br />After a month and a half or so, Jesus goes away, flying up into Heaven to do some work with his dad. Another guy, Paul, just a regular guy who actually used to torment people who believed Jesus, turns his life toward doing stuff for God. He eventually gets killed for it, but not until after he writes a lot of letters that have caused more controversy in this world than probably any other letter.<br />There's some other stories, but the last section, a collection of letters to various churches telling them to shape up, talks about what it is going to be like when Jesus returns from Heaven. Jesus, the ordinary Joe, will be coming back to rule the world and sometime in the process, bring everyone who follows him back to Heaven with him.<br />I could go on and on. It is a huge book... and this version makes it all easy to understand (no high-falooting language).<br />I fully recomment this book.iends, of course, especially Thomas who sees him plain as day, but thinks he is a ghost.<br />After a month and a half or so, Jesus goes away, flying up into Heaven to do some work with his dad.

There is a general chapter outlines, but there is also a detailed outline.

He says loud and clear to avoid the personal finance counselor scam, that overall it is a sham and provides advice to benefit the counselor, not you and me.

Autobiographically written, he manages to bring out his pain in the midst of struggling through ADD as well as his  spiritual growth.<br /><br />I never would've read the book had a dear friend not  given it to me, just as I was learning about my own ADD. I thought it might  be trite, but Evans' story of his life is filled with depth and passion.  His life is far different from mine, but, boiled down, we have shared  similar experiences.<br /><br />Other books on ADD are out there, but for the  spiritual person, especially Christians (Evans is a Presbyterian pastor),  there are few sources for encouragement.<br /><br />Balanced in his book, Evans  shows his struggles were real, drawing him to question his gifts and wonder  where God intended him to go. Through the help of a theater coach and a  family who cared deeply for him, he learned how to manage his focus  better.<br /><br />Any person with ADD who can learn as Evans' learned to focus will  see improvement in his or her job, relationships and internal life. Anyone  with ADD or another LD issue knows the workplace is affected, but social  (platonic) and romantic relationships are where the biggest hurts are felt.  Jobs are easy to find. Friends and significant others are harder to  replace. The pain of losing a job via ADD-related matters is minor when  compared to losing a close friend.<br /><br />The gift of this book didn't transform  my life, but it did encourage me through the toughest diagnosis of my life.  Like my friend realized, I needed to know other people could live  successfully with ADD. Evans' shows it is a long road, but on the road is  evidential growth.<br /><br />I fully recommend this book.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2000-07-26

I started early on a Saturday, reading until I was  done early on Sunday morning.<br /><br />You know how it will end too. The title  cheats us from wondering if Johnny will make it, but at the same time,  there is a peace. Johnny was ready, and teaches us a little bit about being  ready for life's ultimate end.<br /><br />The title, from a famous John Donne poem,  is intriguing, as Donne saw no dignity in death, but that there was dignity  in how we died. It refers to a more famous passage by St. Paul... \\"Oh  Death, where is your sting?\\" talking about how Death has no real power  over the faithful. Johnny was a faithful, powerful young man. He prayed,  like another biblical person, for his unbelief, as he humbly struggles with  trying to believe in God in the middle of his fight for life.<br /><br />John  Gunther, the father, previously best-known for his travel books, has made a  mark on literature which will never be erased.<br /><br />Read this honest, quietly  spiritual, compelling story. You'll be emotionally drained, but better off  for it.<br /><br />I fully recommend this book.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2000-07-22

Several towns argue that they stake their claim in being what Masters asserted to be this mythical town. Petersburg and Lewistown, two towns of otherwise minor repute seem  closest... but it is so much better we haven't an actual town... Spoon  River's residents are our next door neighbors, whether we live in Central  Illinois or Central Florida, or southern Alaska.<br /><br />Masters has written not  fables, but the essence of American life. He hasn't captured the life and  times of 1915, but has instead recorded in 1915 the life and times of our  present day America.<br /><br />The same reason the paintings of Norman Rockwell  makes sense is why Edgar Lee Masters poetry makes sense. To read the quick  messages on the gravestone of one man, learning a little bit him, and  something about a neighbor or two, we can learn a little about how we live  in communities today.<br /><br />Our lives, like Jimmy Stewart's character in  \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" found out, interact and impact everyone  we meet. Who we love, who we should love and who we reject. And when we  die, others feel the loss. Masters has aptly put this in a humorous, yet  insightful way into short verses.<br /><br />The poems don't rhyme. The meter is not  solid, and the poetics aren't intricate. They aren't poems like Poe's or  Dickinson, not in the way they wrote American poems. Don't expect iambic  pentameter-based sonnets or villanelles. Expect a conversation, and listen  in.<br /><br />The poetry here is in the subtle use of social nuance. In the nuances  are his insight and wit. Two readings will bring to light what you miss in  the first.<br /><br />Buy this book, read it slow. It reads faster than most poetry  book, but don't get caught in the temptation to zoom through each poem just  because you can.<br /><br />After you read it, see the play if it happens to be  performed in your town.<br /><br />I fully recommend it.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2000-07-22

You can see his clear cynicism of religion and of  religious people, and of his socialistic leanings (he is direct about these  thoughts). His &quot;Billy Sunday&quot; is an intriguing look at a man who  was just a man, yet spoke about Christ. Though Sandburg was known to be  atheistic, it could be argued he had more spiritual thoughts.<br />You can  read his sense of empathy and unity with the common man. Any urban dweller  will hum in agreement to so much of his Chicago poems.<br />Sandburg's sense  of rural beauty comes out, as does his pure admiration of Lincoln.  Well-said is his recollection of the sinking of the Eastland (a boat which  sunk in the Chicago River)... or, rather, his thoughts of how so many  people died, and how many might've died.<br />I could go poem by poem, but the  fact remains that Sandburg's style impacts poets today, from the Beats to  Maya Angelou, to Gwendolyn Brooks.<br />I fully recommend this book.<br />Anthony  Trendl	2000-07-21

You know who to expect here, and, depending on your knowledge of poetry, might be, as I was, pleasantly surprised and introduced to unfamiliar poets. Buy this book because you can. Read it because the poems are great.<br /><br />One-stop shopping for all your British poetry needs? Not quite. While that fellow Anonymous gets a few selections, as does his various colleagues and peers, consider this a sampler. A few selections from everyone. Yes, yes.. a 589 page sampler. That's the beauty of it.<br /><br />I'm a Hopkins fans, and was pleased to see his best pieces. I expected those. New to me were Marston, Oldys, Googe, and a myriad of others. Now I am intrigued to read more of their work.<br /><br />Portable, and easy to stuff in a coat or briefcase, you'll like the friendly size of the book. The poets are indexed by last name, but organized by chronology in the text itself. The typography is readable (not that teeny tiny stuff some publishers think is good for anthologies).<br /><br />What more could you want?<br /><br />I fully recommend this book.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />AmericanSpeechwriter.com	2000-07-18

Yes	I realize my title is of vague, if not poor in meaning. My thoughts of this dictionary are like that.<br />I love Scrabble. With an English degree, a bookwormish lifestyle and a highly verbal family, I arrogantly call it a  challenge to be taken down by another player. The Scrabble dictionary is  part of my confidence.<br />This dictionary standarizes the game. What other  dictionaries lack is consistency and clarity. What counts as a foreign  word? This dictionary creates a boundary otherwise unavailable for word  usage.<br />If I played Scrabble in a league, I might be pickier about the  words made available. But I like to play Scrabble the most with my aunt and  Grandma out on a porch at a cottage on a lake, or at a coffeehouse with an  editor friend of mine, highly caffeinated... enjoying family or friendship  more than the game. Therefore, the Official Scrabble Dictionary is plenty  for me.<br />Tidy little definitions are provided. &quot;Hemagog&quot; is  defined as &quot;an agent that promoters blood flow.&quot; Lets me know I  can put an &quot;S&quot; on the end to pluralize it, that 'hemagog' is a  noun. I am happy with that, yet fully aware a hematologist could tell me a  hundred more things.<br />Profanity unfortunately is in there. All our  favorite four-letter words seem to have made the cut. Yes, even THAT one.  But the fact of the matter is what makes for common conversation is not  always appropriate family discussion. A &quot;legal&quot; word in this book  makes the game awkward when players with young children. I'm not saying  don't buy the book. I am saying that you should be aware.<br />I recommend  this book with the caveat that if you want to know everything about a word,  buy the Oxford English Dictionary. If you want to play a relaxed game of  Scrabble... buy this book.<br />Anthony Trendl	2000-07-16

I've never heard it used in conversation, but \\"trendl\\"  is in there with plenty of variant meanings and literary references.<br /><br />It  isn't for everyone. Who needs a huge multi-volume dictionary... keeping in  mind multi means what multi should mean... many? However, for those days  when TV is a drag, NPR seems like the same old shows rescripted and you  just don't feel like doing anything... browse, browse, browse!<br /><br />Get lost  in the incidental words of the English language. Look up one word, and find  a hundred more twice as fun as the one before. You'll never use any of them  short of a good game of Scrabble or the GRE verbal exam. Who cares!<br /><br />Words  are delicious and full of stories. Read about the them here in delectable  detail and glory. Chew on each morsel of etymological insight...<br /><br />Of  course, it costs a fortune. And the CD Rom doesn't work on Macs. But those  details can be overlooked if you have the money and shelfspace for the  print editions.<br /><br />By the way, if you buy the big OED... get a copy of one  of the guides to help you through this thing.

Drawing from the conversational poetry found in books like Edgar Lee Masters \\"Spoon River Anthology,\\" Marquis uses a colloquial style which  not only suits his characters, but works in a poem. Lots of laughs, some  decent writing, and a tasty way to spend a Saturday afternoon.<br /><br />Talking  animals are easy to find in literature. Good ones, like a cat and a  cockroach of this caliber, are not. Marquis brings humanity by allowing his  animals to stay animals. Spiders still are poisonous, rats are still  threatening, and cockroaches have never been able to type the capital  letters on a typewriter. Marquis pushes reality, keeping his characters  grounded in truth (OK, he fudges with truth a lot, but don't let that stop  you).<br /><br />While filled with humorous tales, moments are sad, like in the  ninth poem, \\"freddy the rat perishes.\\" Dear Freddy has a run in  with a spider who is up to no good. In a valiant struggle, a tough South  American spider (\\"raised on red pepper and blood\\" and  \\"nursed on tabasco sauce\\") Freddy is killed while saving his  friends. Freddy ate some poisoned cheese the night before and let the  spider bite him, knowing he had nothing to lose. After it was over, Archy  and Mehitabel dropped Freddy \\"off the fire escape into the alley  with/military honors\\". Despite the whole premise being ridiculous, a  tear might well up.<br /><br />Children will love being read the stories, and  younger teens may find poetry readable (before you send them on to Keats  and Byron!). Great, funny pictures, completely in the context of each  poem-tale.<br /><br />I fully recommend this book.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2000-07-15

I needed to know  Quark, and bought this book. Best move I could've made. You should buy  it.<br /><br />Above everything, David Blatner is well-organized. Anyone who writes  a software book will know his stuff, but getting that info from his head to  mine is not always easy. Blatner makes it easy.<br /><br />For example, each chapter  listed in the contents gets a paragraph summary. He gets straight to the  nuggets of what I need to know. No mumbo jumbo.<br /><br />The first chapter is the  basics. A thirty minute lesson in the important things. In Ch. 2 he  elabortates on his initial information in Ch. 1. From then on, he goes bit  by bit, explaining tools and typography and how text and images work  together. Nothing too techie, but he respects that readers have brains as  well.<br /><br />Fantastic layout... he provides graphs and, better yet, the actual  dialogue boxes you'll see at a particular point. There are charts galore,  including a nice one on special punctuation (how to make ligatures and  dagger and that ever elusive cents sign).<br /><br />Among the better aspects of the  book was his chapter on tools. My weakest area... and where a lot of people  lack, is in knowing how the tools are fully used. My understanding of the  text tools multiplied after reading about this.<br /><br />I could on and on. It is  a thick book. Not a quick read... typical computer book in that respect.  However, when I compared it to the competition, Blatner's Quark Xpress book  by far the best by for the cash.<br /><br />I fully recommend this book.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2000-07-10

Don't let me take away from those values at all... but Harper Lee has written a book transcending a literary social commentary. She has written a love story.<br /><br />A love story? huh? Who gets married? Does anyone kiss? Are there passages of deep romance? No, no, no... none of that. Try instead family love.<br /><br />Atticus is the kind of single dad we need to see more of in this generation. He cares for his children so much that he protects them from the fires of his grown-up life of representing an innocent man. He protects them from the full impact of his neighbor's lies. He shows them how to love them, even though he knows his neighbors hate him and the love of fellow man he represents.<br /><br />If all Atticus, the father, did, was love the innocent man, he would be doing a good thing, but he demonstrates love and allows dignity (when possible) for the ones persecuting the innocent. He shows he is a big man, and his children mimic this sense of understanding.<br /><br />Deeply rooted in the memories of his children, the story has a gentle subtext of growing up. You can almost taste the lemonade of the porch and smell the flowers in nearby gardens.<br /><br />Lee's power as an author here is that she does let her statements about humanity overtake the story. Rather, she lets the story tell the story, and she just writes down what happened in her imagination.<br /><br />Her characters are not paste-up Southern children or adults, but complex characters all of us relate to (even me up here near Chicago!). Relationships are embedded in the depth of being neighbors. This creating a milieu of angst in Atticus' children when they see the adults warring in court and out of court in matters of truth.<br /><br />I fully recommend this book, and think to give it the best reading possible, examine how interwoven the story is with its various cultures and characters.

SP is generally aware  of what makes an athlete tick, and good training is where it starts.  Instead, I feel like I was reading encylopedia entries: A little info,  enough to let me know a given event requires good form... but they tried to  pack too much into too few pages. Good pictures (though they look dated),  indicating proper form, but not much else.<br />What could be that one book  covering all track events resulted in being that book which sounds like a  high school student's senior report.<br />SP: Go back, add 300 more pages,  equally divided among the track events, and publish it. Otherwise, don't  waste the paper.	2000-05-13

When Ferdinand gets stung, he acts the way we all envision bulls acting. Everyone thinks he could fight in the ring, but he is  happiest smelling flowers.<br />As a person who hates bees, and certainly did  as a young boy, I can understand the reaction Ferdinand has. Youch!<br />As  much as I love the book, it does leave off the horrid reality about  bullfighting, how bulls are tortured and killed. As a kids' book, maybe it  shouldn't, but hopefully, children get fooled into thinking bullfighting is  just a game. Hence, my rating is only four stars.<br />Read it to your child,  and explain what bullfighting it. At the very least, Ferdinand makes it  clear he'd rather play in a meadow.	2000-05-12

This book helped me use the few  dollars we had without comprosing quality required to make a good  impression to publications.<br />It explains the basics, what make a good PR  person, and how to pull together the job of convincing others to cover your  stories. How to get pics published, media visits, controversy. Logically  written, it outlines options and reasons for responding to various  situations.<br />A great asset.. this book has a solid directory of resources  to help you get your job done.<br />No essential is left without guidance.  However, missing from it is a &quot;new&quot; essential, the web. Maybe a  newer edition will come out to cover this?	2000-05-12

Milnes' \\"When We Were Very Young,\\" collects and reminds us of childhood bliss. However, unlike Stevenson, Milne has the whimsy of Edward Lear's limericks and verse. Milne captures the joy and gentleness of youth.<br /><br />For example, Milne has a poem with a refrain:<br /><br />Jonathon Jo<br />has a mouth like an 'O'<br /><br />It is fun to say, and it almost means something. Another poem talks about halfway up and down the stairs, getting a child to see the difference and sameness of the situation, great for critical thinking.<br /><br />If you want pure silly humor, go buy Silverstein, but for great writing and solid bedtime reading to teach your child wit and poetry, buy this tiny book. There's a good chance you will like it as well.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />[...]	2000-05-09

Chambers speaks, in one-a-day bites, about the devotion a Christian must have to be obedient to God. These aren't \\"sound bites,\\" but  morsels of a very meaty meal. Catholics and Protestants both will find  Chambers pointing the way to Heaven, and helping us know how to live out  Christ's plan while still on Earth.<br /><br />A verse accompanies each day, and  these ought be looked up to see the fully context. Have your Bible and a  notepad next to you.<br /><br />Chambers is candid to say the Christian life is  difficult, but encourages us that this difficulty should challenge us, not  scare us away. Maybe Chambers might like the slogan \\"A few good  men,\\" except this time referring to future converts?<br /><br />For people who  like the \\"Daily Bread\\" booklets, check \\"My Utmost\\" out.  Like the DB series, each entry will take you just a few minutes to read,  but plenty of time to ponder.<br /><br />Use this together as a discussion step with  another person, your spouse or small group. Figure out why Chambers places  the standard so high -- does Scripture agree? And once you figure out the  answer for a given day's passage, now what?

Let's forget that this book is a huge bestseller in the running market. Lots of running books are more hype than content, or only regurgatate what last month's \\"Runner's World\\" has said, and sell just as well.  However, \\"The Competitive Runner's Handbook\\" is informative,  thorough and engaging.<br /><br />Returning to racing after some fifteen years of  basic jogging, I needed a book that took my knowledge seriously. Glover and  camp give hard-core, nuts and bolts info. They've provided for the various  levels of fitness. I'm not going to run my high schools times first time  out, but what happens when I get my speed down? It is in here. Solid  how-to, without the fluff of running psychobabble.<br /><br />Run a 10K? Wanna know  how byou might do in a 20K? In a half-marathon? Charts galore. How 'bout  intervals and tempo workouts. Marathon training tips? 5K tips? Got  'em!<br /><br />The beauty of this book.. and the fundmental reason I recommend it, is because the base of info and guidance here is fantastic.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2000-05-05

I'm glad, because these are well-written, and intensely exciting. Far better to read HP than most of of the other  boy-hero books. Harry is not the snide rich kid saves all through rejecting  the 'wisdom' of adults kinds of tales (anything Macauley Culkin has ever  done, for example).<br /><br />In all, the Harry Potter books are intelligent. For  the kids who think the Babysitters Club or Goosebumps are the best the  world, start with Harry. Then work your way over on the shelf to read the  Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis.<br /><br />Will there be a fifth, sixth or seventh  Harry?	2000-05-05

Trouble is, like children, they are tiny,  and get intimidated by the bigness of Boston.<br />A kind policeman helps them  out, as do the people of the swan boat, easing the stress of the  journey.<br />A few books should matter to children. This one matters to me.  The alliteration, the dance of the words is supurb, yet the pictures are  far from an afterthought.<br />As a picture book with no social ore political  agenda, it is a delight to read aloud. Moms and Dads and big siblings will  love going through the challenging duckling names quickly (Zack and Lack  and Mack, etc.) without getting tongue-tied.<br />Your library will have this  book, but buy it. Get the hardcover. I still have the one my mom bought me  in the late 60s or early 70s.	2000-05-04

A Caldecott Award winner, the pictures drive the tale as much as the plot. An excellent book from cover-to-cover.<br /><br />Re-reading it now brings back great memories and fascination of how Mike Mulligan and his beloved steam shovel worked hard to accomplish a fantastic task. Whenever people watched them dig, they always worked a little better and a little faster.<br /><br />Although it is somewhat dated, and even has Mike smoking at the end (you'd never see a responsible publisher do that today), it holds on to five stars.<br /><br />A modern John Henry, Mike faces the challenge of new technology. Undaunted, like the famous hammer-driving tall tale hero, he struggles to meet the task. Can he dig a hole faster than the new machine? Can he and his mighty red-metal friend do it by the end of the day?<br /><br />A great story of perseverence and hard work, I fully recommend &#34;Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel.&#34; Place it on your shelf next to &#34;Make Way for Ducklings&#34; and &#34;Where the Wild Things Are.&#34;<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />anthonytrendl.com	2000-05-04

Hoffman can't ignore history and doesn't, but he does talk, unlike many others,  about the writing. He does it in a playful, flirtacious way, yet engages a  Poe fan in something beyond the 'same old, same old'. If it is the last  word on Poe you want, that authoritative tome of all things Poe, go  elsewhere. If you want to kick back and ENJOY a new look at one of the most  influential American writers ever, buy this one.	2000-05-02

Different pictures, same poems. I learned to imagine and believe in ordinary, yet beautiful things. Even  today, in my own writing, I smile realizing how and when I learned a technique ... just by listening to my mother whisper these poems  nightly.<br /><br />Aptly named, RLS has the reader remembering the wonderful days  of playing alone and with friends, of delighting in the moment.<br /><br />Your  child will gain an understanding of classic children's poetry, of the  rhythm and rhyme. They sound eloquent aloud, and read gentle at bedtime.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />TreeFortBooks.com	2000-05-02

As I grow older, I discover how my understanding of how to approach God changes. My capacity to be quiet and listen, and to consider His presence strengthens with each year. Foster  discusses the ways through the centuries, and from Christ's own example,  how to meditate, how to pray, how to study, how to be in solitude, and so  on. Never does Foster compromise biblical Christianity with tradition, or  with a new age view of contemplative discipline. Have your Bible open, and  be ready to be challenged to rethink experiential  faith in ways as old as  the New Testament. Keep &#34;Celebration&#34; handy too... it isn't a  one-sitting kind of book. It isn't so thick or difficult to understand, but  to integrate these disciplines will require slow and careful reading of  this book.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	2000-05-01

Nonetheless, I found the Frylings' handbook refreshing and honest about communications and expectations among couples. I bought it on a whim, having heard that the  Frylings do not sugarcoat reality in their presentation. My own  relationship was floundering and I needed direction. I wish I had bought it  several months earlier!<br /><br />While written from a evangelical Christian  perspective, it has that special universality of truth for every couple  looking to understand and to communicate with their mate or future  spouse.<br /><br />I can see it being read alone for personal growth, with your  fiance, or even the two of you with a counselor or older, wiser friend.  Better yet, try going through this (be ready to be challenged!) with a  married couple who seems to \\"have it together.\\"<br /><br />Catholics will  love it as an addition to their time spent in pre-marital counseling.  You're best to buy two copies, with each person reading a portion (set up  in topical chapters with discussion questions).<br /><br />Though I'm one who has  never been married, I believe it would be great for a couple married  several years as well, helping re-ground your marriage. Don't think of this  as just a tool to get your spouse to open up, but as a mutual opportunity  to renew the love which drew you to marriage in the first place.<br /><br />This  book is no panacea, but it can assist a new beginning, or a careful  grounding for a future marriage.<br /><br />For you single guys (and gals) get a  copy of \\"A Handbook for Engaged Couples\\" and read it. It'll help  you (and me) relate to anyone you might consider saying \\"I do\\"  with on an altar someday.<br /><br />(post-script: I have since been engaged, and can further attest to this book's usefulness, having been happily married now since 2004).<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	1999-09-10

For readers who feel God is distant or not listening, and are looking to be encouraged in their faith, get \\"Finding God Between a Rock and a Hard Place.\\"<br /><br />While our society lives in a 'show me' mindset, they don't always realize God is showing Himself. Readers appreciating books from TD Jakes to CS Lewis to Jack Deere to John MacArthur... as varied as they are, will all find \\"Finding God Between a Rock & A Hard Place: Stories of Gratitude and Grace\\" a hardcore look at answered prayer.<br /><br />These stories are real. They are a result of knee-bent prayer, and the grace of God.<br /><br />It looks great (typeset beautifully), reads well, engages the mind, heart and soul... after you read it, pass it on. It would make a warm, gentle gift to a friend needing a boost.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Finding God Between a Rock & A Hard Place.\\" I hope there is a sequel, or some other variation. Good testimonies of God's grace are abound, but are too rarely bound in as well-said as found in these pages. God's glory needs to be declared, and here, He shines.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />americanspeechwriter.com	1999-09-09

Granted, bigger volumes can be found, but this brings to print some of his major works. Start with this one, then buy \\"Poe, Poe, Poe, Poe...\\" and learn  something about the person he was. Read about first as a poet and author  here, avoiding all the fluff about horror in his life. \\"The  Raven\\" is a love story, not a scary poem. The poet is lamenting a love  lost to death, not creating a creepy tale about a talking bird. \\"The  Tell-Tale Heart\\" is about the foolishness of crime and criminals, not  a murder mystery. Read the best of Poe, and then buy a full set of his  poems, stories, letters and criticisms. Fascinating stuff.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com	1999-08-10

Did they throw this book across the room, finding the ideas written here exasperatingly true? Lewis makes clear challenges about how Satan insidiously, yet effectively ensnares our  sensibility. These letters exchanged between a demon and a disciple  learning how to defy God and defeat a man's devotion to Christ, readers  will be drawn in by Lewis' creative accessibility to our inner life. I  found my thoughts and motivations so frustratingly twisted by Satan as I  considered the truth in &quot;Screwtape.&quot; This is a good choice for  &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; fans as they discover living a godly life is  more than just wanting to do God's will. Be ready to be humbled as you  discover how carefully Satan's minions work to have us believing we are  living righteously. Any cynic of Christianity might find this refreshing  fodder of thought as well.	1999-08-09

Yup... because a study of this text may revolutionize your view of leadership and what it means to be led. It did for me.<br /><br />This book focuses on Christian leadership, outlining the lives of known leaders and  how God developed them to do what He needed them to do.<br /><br />It provides an  honest, challenging and humbling understanding the responsibilities of  being a leader, and how to develop a sucessor. This is for serious students  of God who do not depend on 'rah-rah' leadership, but deep, life-long  goals. Similarly, this isn't a PK-style look at leadership, though it comes  from an evangelical understanding of God. However, PK fans might see this  as a bigger, next step in a long journey.<br /><br />The focus is about serving  Christ, about being lead by Him, and in turn, in obedience, leading others  to serve Him.<br /><br />I read it in the context of a Wheaton College masters-level  missions course.<br /><br />The writer is a professor at Fuller Theo.
