With a heroine named Psyche Persephone Hill, it is no wonder that Dear Imposter reflects the influence of several myths. The excessively proper Psyche is tempted into an outrageous faade when she learns she will gain control of half of her inheritance when she announces her engagement. She instructs her maid to hire an actor who will play the role of a fianc.  It certainly sounds like the stage for a Pygmalion story with the low-born actor remade into a worthy suitor.  But the man who arrives at the betrothal party has no need of instruction; Psyche eventually learns Gabriel Sinclair is not an actor but a most improper gentleman.<BR> Like the Psyche of myth, she falls in love with a man whose identity is a mystery to her. Like the Persephone of myth, she loves a dark figure who frequents the Regency underworld of gambling hells. However, this Psyche challenges her love to make his home in her world while he helps her overcome her fears of impropriety. Meanwhile, the danger escalates through the attacks of Barrett, who would rather kill than lose the estate he gambled away to Gabriel.<BR> Nicole Byrd has crafted a particularly clever tale. The ties to <BR>mythology enhance and never detract from the plot. It takes a great skill to weave all of these elements together this well. Dear Imposter is a joy to read.	2001-08-31

He is now faced with the dilemma of maintaining his distance from an all too attractive and knowing wife while attempting to commit one last daring deed as Gentleman Niall.

This book, the sixth collection of short stories from a mystery writer's group, is a mixed bag of candy and cardboard.  With no wonders of style or brilliance of plot, it's still a good read.  In this world, of course, somebody's always got a secret.  It starts with Lawrence Block's gritty, compassionate cop, a guy I'd like to meet at a party: &quot;I don't remember what she was wearing, but I'm sure she looked good in it.  She always did.&quot;  As a favor to a friend, he's called in to deal with the awkwardness when a card game ends with a stabbing.  He manages to hide everybody's dirty laundry, including his own, and still be a decent man.  The book ends with a nasty, preachy little mess by Whitley Strieber, but along the way we also get Dorothy Salisbury Davis's story of small-town intrigue.  The narrator is a lawyer with a healthy skepticism about his fellow citizens, such as the coroner who &quot;had a doctor-of-medicine degree, which I guess entitles you to work on dead people if that's your preference.&quot;  And, naturally, the wandering preacher who brings a hidden agenda to the town.  From Mickey Friedman we get skullduggery among the spinsters at the Estelle Peavy Residence for Women.  The heroine takes time out from her epic poem about Cape St. Sebastian, Florida, to find out where Gigi the stripper disappeared to.  In Judith Kelman's story we eavesdrop on six women hell-bent on sweet, gruesome revenge on a con-man Lothario (unless perhaps one of them breaks a nail).  And we get Justin Scott's sweet tale of a cat trying to save his lady-love's kitten from a fierce blizzard and a predatory owl.	2001-07-29

Her hair was white-girl straight and could be flipped over her shoulder for emphasis, if necessary; she was fashionably thin and could wear all those designer clothes just like the supermodels; and she was the only African-American lawyer in her law firm and had gotten there without any so-called help from affirmative action.  She had it made. And then things started to fall apart.    Her fancy law firm gave her a pitiful EEO case to try, then suddenly pulled out a list of complaints about her from her clients and put her on three-month administrative leave.  Her grandmother, Meemaw, was running around her hometown with some ex-pro jock named GoGo, who was 40 years her junior. The final straw was when Garvin showed up, Meemaw put her in the guest house out back instead of in her old room in the house where Meemaw lived!  Garvin had to get her life together, and she was going to start by getting rid of Mr. I-like-older-women-GoGo!  This is a well-written, fast-paced, down home story of a well-meaning, but very misguided young lady trying to come to grips with herself, her identity and her life.   When her grandmother tries to steer her towards the Lord and His teachings, her analytical, legal mind just can't accept that it could be that easy.  This story takes you back home, no matter where your home is.  The descriptions of life in a small Southern Black town are so vivid that you feel like you're really there.  The humor, wisdom and philosophy of the grandmother make this a book that you can refer to for help in resolving your own problems in life.  A wonderful, uplifting, inspirational book.	2001-07-28

Where women hold the power and the aristocracy expects young men to prove their innocence prior to marriage.  Jorlan Reynard wants more out of life than to marry and father children, and he cannot believe that family friend Green Tamryn would force his hand. Green recognizes Jorlan's special qualities --not only his character, but also new powers that have recently evolved in their world.  When an unscrupulous aristocrat who would never appreciate Jorlan makes an offer Jorlan's grandmother cannot refuse.  Green comes to the rescue by claiming Jorlan first. Convincing Jorlan to be happy with the arrangement will prove a challenge, but teaching him the pleasures of  the marriage bed will be Green's compensation.  The reversal of roles across an entire society is a huge undertaking and done exceedingly well in this story. Both entertaining and thought-provoking, Ritual of Proof lives up to Dara Joy's standards for fun, likable characters and sensual story-telling.	2001-07-28

After looking after her and the kids all the years since David's untimely death, he'd be damned if he was going to let her give away her \\"virginity\\" to somebody else!   For all those ladies out there past your twenties, this is a story that will stir your heart ... Lori Foster has put into this short story all the dreams (and fears) of every woman who no longer has that \\"perfect figure\\" and fantasizes on meeting that one sexy lover of her dreams.   In \\"Truth or Dare\\" by Laura Bradley Shay McIntyre stood staring at the magnificent specimen in front of her, a bull rider. When it came to a devil-may-care attitude, Luke Wilder was the worst of the lot.  He  took chances and rode bulls that no one else in their right mind would go anywhere near.

A cast of colorful secondary characters can be found here whose antics will have you either laughing out loud or wanting to wring their necks.

A wealthy young widow and a new earl are surprised to learn that they have inherited joint custody of a high-spirited fifteen-year-old girl.  Harriet and Marcus, both strong-willed, reach a tentative agreement over what is best for their ward.   However, in matters of politics, they seem irreconcilable.  In a story with frequent references to Jane Austen's works, Harriet is a more mature version of Emma.  She believes she knows what is best for the people around her.  Carried away with her mission, Harriet is sometimes blinded to her ward's wishes, and may endanger Marcus, the man Harriet has loved from childhood.  Political reform in Regency England is not a new theme, but this novel does an excellent job of addressing it.  The story enlightens without being didactic.  The absorbing characters turn a history lesson into a delight.  Although the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is overall a clever and sweet story.	2001-07-28

Being the daughter of the richest man in England did have some advantages, the main one being able to marry a title.  Allegra Morgan was well aware of that and had decided early on that she would settle for nothing less than an earl or a duke. Love didn't matter--it never did in marriages of convenience.  All she asked was that he be nice to look at, not cruel and would allow her to handle her own financial affairs and businesses as her father had taught her and allowed her to do at home.  The last part was the sticky part, but when the impoverished Duke of Sedgewick asked for her hand in marriage and assured her he would not interfere in her business dealings, Allegra was more than happy to accept.   The Duke, a practical man, knew he had to marry money to preserve his holdings and help all the people who worked the land and depended on him for their livelihood. Pride was all well and good, but it didn't buy seed, rebuild houses or replenish stock.  Since he was a fairly modern and enlightened gentleman when it came to women and financial matters, the match was made.  Then the French Revolution intruded upon their idyllic life, and Allegra discovered that her husband, the Duke, had more &quot;sides&quot; to him than she knew!  Bertrice Small has written an erotic love story of life among the wealthy, genteel English nobility. The love scenes are steamy and, for once, the heroine is not a spoiled, self-centered brat who must be &quot;tamed&quot; by her husband.  Even though rich, she is grounded in reality and has a generous nature, which is rare for the time period. A refreshing, sexy change.	2001-07-24

This hilarious tale of a cynical divorce and the man who believes in love at first sight is one of the wittiest, sexy stories that I've read in a long time.

The border lands between England and Scotland are dangerous places for anyone, especially a woman.  Raven Carleton is unimpressed with the wild nature of her English home, for it closely mirrors her own temperament.  Heath Kennedy thrives in his Scottish home, raising his horses and protecting his clan.  In retribution for the theft of his prized herd, Heath takes Raven and her betrothed hostage.  He has no intention of returning Raven, for she has captivated him.  Raven finds herself unwillingly attracted to the rogue.  In their tumultuous surroundings, love is not as easy as declaring feelings and living happily ever after.  Virginia Henley has written an enjoyable story despite some flaws.  The most glaring transgression is the use of words that were not part of the English language in Medieval England or using words that were in existence but had yet to take on the meaning she conveyed.  This caused a &quot;jerking away&quot; from the story.  Raven's thought process as she lingered between the English lord and the Scottish man leaned toward confusing at times.  For a woman who flaunted convention at every opportunity, she was willing to give up true love to conform to expectations.  Regardless of its problems, it still catches the interest and begs to be completely read.	2001-07-22

So why are they marrying her off to highwayman Patrick &quot;Trick&quot; Caldwell?  Trick, she soon learns, is actually a duke. A promise to King Charles II forced him into the highwayman charade. As much as he would like to explain his mission to his bride, Trick has promised his sovereign that he will tell no one. Hurt by what she perceives as a lack of trust in her, Kendra is determined to learn her husband's secrets.  Their opposing views of love present yet another challenge to the newlyweds. Having been betrayed in the past, Trick does not believe in love.  Unprepared for her wedding night, Kendra decides that the act of love brings only pain, and she refuses to try it again.  This stubborn, well-matched pair will not give up on each other. He schemes to seduce her body, while she attempts to seduce his heart.  Occasionally the dialogue of characters from 1668 clashes with the more modern style of the narrative, but that is a minor quibble in this lively tale. Interesting snippets of history are incorporated seamlessly, always contributing to the plot. Fans of the Chase family will enjoy catching up with Kendra's brothers, and fans of strong-willed heroines will love Kendra.	2001-07-21

When Viscount Drake meets Miss Truelove Becket, he mistakes her name for Truelove Beckons.  For Drake, the lady's sweetness and purity of spirit do beckon.  Wounded in soul from the war and his near death at Waterloo, Drake is plagued with nightmares.  With Truelove he finds peace.  As their friendship evolves into love, the couples' families resist.  Drake's parents expect him to wed Arabella.  Lady Swinley, who is Arabella's mother and Truelove's cousin, does not want Truelove to steal this prize.  Truelove will seem either refreshing or unrealistically good, depending on the reader. Arabella is an interesting companion wavering between being the sweet child Truelove recalls and the simpering, scheming creature Lady Swinley has instructed her to be.

She has walked off her job, called off her engagement with her rich fianc, and now she finds herself in a car accident being pulled out by a handsome and kind stranger.  Mike Ramesy, the stranger, asks himself what he should do with the woman he is investigating who now needs his help.  He, Department of Transportation investigator working undercover, offers her help in the way of a ride in his truck of California from Pittsburgh to visit her psychic aunt.  This should give him time to find out how she is committing her crimes of stealing truck shipments insured by the company she works for.  This is also gives them both time to fall in love, regardless of the fact that she is his chief suspect.  Ms. Douglas does an excellent job of heightening the suspense so the reader wonders all along if Rose really is hijacking the shipments.  She also gives just enough supporting characters to redirect the suspicion to them, but not so many the reader is frustrated.  Ms. Douglas also gets high marks for showing and telling the personality of her characters.  We see how they both react to stressful events and other people in need in humane and honest ways, such as listening to a father explain how his son had been doing worse since his wife left.  Some of the events are a bit over the top, such as a pregnant teen having a baby in the middle of a snowstorm with only the two of them to deliver it.  Also, the history of Mike is missing.  The over reliance on italics caused confusion.  With many of the romance novels today focused on sex and large and frequent sex scenes, this romance focuses on two people falling in love and solving a crime.	2001-07-16

After the death of their father, they found out that his fortune was gone.  So Anthea sets out to Kansas to become a teacher.            Her new job is harder than she ever imagined.  Her classroom is lacking in supplies, and her students are wild and do not attend to her at all.  And one of the parents is attacking her teaching abilities and priorities.  She soon finds out that this parent, Gabriel Jackson, is a bad man... at least according to the town gossip.            Gabriel was illegitimate, and the townspeople won't let him forget it. To make matters worse, he takes in nine-year-old Lily when her mother, the town whore, died. He knew no one else would care for her, but he is ill-equipped to be a father.  Anthea begins to make a difference in Lily's life and also in his. He doesn't want to be drawn to her--but then he finds out that there is more to Lily than he ever expected.              This deceptively simple novel starts with a commonplace premise--the proper, innocent teacher and the wicked outsider--then shows that the schoolteacher is not entirely innocent, and the outsider is not as wicked as gossip paints him. It is also colored with lively touches, some common, some not. And every scene from Lily's point of view is uniquely affecting.	2001-07-15

It was decided that Alys would go, but her older half-sister Emma asks to take her place because Alys is sickly and is only a child.  Emma faces severs hostility at Penruan.  Dain cannot trust her because his mother has poisoned his mind against anyone bearing the name. While his mother is away, Emma works in the still room with herbs and herbal remedies. She has magical ability, but hides it because Dain is biased against magic.  Emma's life becomes infinitely more difficult when Dain's mother comes home.  She is a bitter, poisonous woman full of unreasonable rage and false piety.  She does everything she can to undermine Emma and remind Dain of the feud.  He resists his mother's hateful words, but will he still support Emma when he learns of her magical abilities... and her true parentage?  I would have liked to see Emma do magic earlier in the book, but I enjoyed the characters of Emma, Agatha, Vivienne, and Hermit. And the addition of the legend of Merlin and Nimue was a nice touch. An enjoyable work.	2001-07-14

Cassandra Abbott is the very image of propriety. In fact, she wrote an etiquette book and lives the words she wrote. Bryce Keene is her polar opposite. He craves excitement, and his choice of a bride reflects this.  Cassandra, on the other hand, accepts her parents' choice of husband.  Flash forward seven years later. Both are widowed. Cassandra was married to a controlling old man who left her destitute. Bryce's wild bride slept with servants and half the ton before her death. Both Cassandra and Bryce are scarred and lacking in trust... and Bryce is also left with a niece who is showing signs of becoming as wild as his wife. She needs a calming influence, and someone who can tutor her on the proprieties... and who better than Cassandra?  She agrees to wed him but is far different from Bryce's expectations, from her provisions to her ugly cat.  Bryce and Cassandra spend their days trying to outwit each other... and trying to keep Bryce's niece from spinning utterly out of control, for there are forces at work that want nothing more than to ruin all that Bryce values....            Settle in for an exhilarating battle of wits between a man who is becoming more proper and a woman who is learning the value of breaking some of society's harsh rules. This is a truly sparkling work with an alluring extra feature: excerpts of Cassandra's etiquette book are featured at the beginning of each chapter. It was great fun to see how each rule applied to the chapter, and how it was broken!	2001-07-14

Rising Eagle and Buffalo Dreamer knew their visions of the future regarding their tribe were destined to come true no matter how disturbing they were.  There would be no stopping the migration of the white settlers into their lands, and they both knew something had to be done and soon.  As a Lakota holy man, Rising Eagle had been told to take Buffalo Dreamer as his wife because she was the Chosen One that he had dreamt about. Together, they had seen over thirty years of their visions come true one by one.  They had raised their children to be strong and true.  Even now, their oldest, Brave Horse, rode with his best friend Crazy Horse to keep the Lakota lands peaceful and free of the white settlers who were constantly coming onto their lands looking for gold. Mystic Warriors is the final chapter of the saga of Rising Eagle and Buffalo Dreamer.  Ms. Bittner weaves a tale around historical fact that explains the battle the Lakota Nation went though to preserve their sacred tribal lands better than any history book ever did.  She brings out, in story form, the treachery and hatefulness that was practiced against the Lakota while, at the same time, preserving the beauty and dignity of the tribal rituals and beliefs.

She literally runs into Tobias while investigating the man blackmailing her.  They form an uneasy alliance when they determine they are working toward a mutual goal. An interesting mystery is the heart of plot of this story.  The investigation is full of twists and turns and unusual details.  The outcome is unsure until the very end, with the suspense building until the resolution.  Unfortunately, the budding romance at the heart of any romance, is sorely missing from this story.

Talya Stevenson had moved on after an intensely abusive relationship.  She had a new job as a financial manager and a new apartment. Her job at the bank provided her with learning experiences and brought her in contact with Weston Realty.    Enter Meridian Weston, millionaire real estate magnate who is intrigued by the reserved, attractive woman who is all business.  She manages his company's accounts but rebuffs any advances he makes toward a personal relationship.  Eventually though she is enticed by Meridian's kindness and patience.  It doesn't take long for him to realize that Talya must be handled delicately when she reveals the details of her past.  Matters are complicated when Jason, her ex-boyfriend, tracks her down and starts making threats and causing havoc.    This novel had well-developed characters and compelling secondary characters and a story of this nature that explores abusive relationships is timely.  This reviewer had a hard time, however, warming to the female protagonist because she seemed to be too much of a victim--it seemed as a result  at times by her own hand., vacillating between being the strong, independent woman to being a whiner.  She was not deserving of Meridian who just wanted a fifty-fifty love as Teddy Pendergrast would say, not a sixty-forty relationship that was subject to her tenuous stability.	2001-07-08

Ariel Summers knew the only thing she wanted more than to get away from her drunken, abusive father was to realize her dream to become a lady.  She would do anything to achieve that goal.  Of course, at the tender of age of fourteen, she hardly knew what exactly anything entailed, but she was willing to do it, including making a deal with Edmund Ross, Fourth Earl of Greville, her father's landlord.  She had heard the rumors about him and all his women (young girls actually) and had seen the way he looked at her when he thought she wasn't looking.  So maybe he would be willing to finance her education and conversion to a lady in exchange for her becoming his mistress after she graduates.  Simple, right?  When Justin Bedford was called before his dying father, all he wanted from the old lecher was the legitimacy of his name.  He knew his father only thought of him as a costly mistake, but since he had no legitimate offspring, the Earl had no choice but to name Justin his successor and legally give him his name.  Thus Justin Bedford, upon reaching his majority, became Justin Bedford Ross, the Fifth Earl of Greville.  And though he hated everything about his father and his life, upon his father's death, Justin inherited all the old Earl's wealth, estates and responsibilities... including Ariel Summers	2001-07-08

Ellen Cornelius had gone to Steve Corey at the request of her elderly aunt Alexandra Landseer, who wanted to find a magic fountain of youth.  Though all Steve was interested in was the money, he promised to take the two women to a lost city where the magic waters flowed and age would fade away.          That wasn't the only thing which would fade.  Steve would make sure that Ellen's inhibitions would disappear as well, as the dark, handsome stranger would find his way into her dreams, and eventually, her heart.          This well constructed, sensual story has conflict and adventure at every turn, from Alexandra's search for magic beauty to Ellen's own internal quest for something which no fountain of youth can deliver.  The characters are believable, and Steve Corey is definitely tall, dark,  handsome and worth keeping on your bookshelf.	2001-07-07

Jean Bouclaire was unfortunate enough to have two strong-willed women who wanted to share in every aspect of his life--his daughter Delphine and the love of his life Gabrielle Gallant.  In the Louisiana Territory of 1768, those women proved to be both a hindrance and a boon.  He was an independent business man, a pirate, and a smuggler.  He did not want either woman with him, regardless of how much they wanted to be with him.  Fate conspired against him.  The settings for this story were many and varied, all well researched and well described.  Enough history was mingled throughout the story to achieve a realistic feel without bogging down the flow.  French phrases sprinkled about added to the feel.  The characters were well defined, including the secondary ones, and the plot was well paced.  The final part of a trilogy, the book can be read alone and still enjoyed.  The ending of the story was a bit too contrived and expected, but did not detract from the overall enjoyability.	2001-07-07

Matt Starr is a wealthy computer whiz.  Left standing at the altar once before by Matt, Lily is none too pleased when he disappears for a second time, just days before their wedding.  Despite the efforts of Matt's best friend Dennis Wagner to convince her that something is wrong, it isn't until Matt's dog appears on the scene that Lily realizes Dennis is right and sets out to find her missing man.  Lily is aided in her search by Dennis, her best friend Sadie, and canine sleuths Buzz and Gracie.  The search is going nowhere fast until Lily comes into possession of the Secret Keeper's amulet.  Suddenly she's having visions associated with Matt's disappearance.  At times the dialogue drags on adding nothing to the story.  The reader learns early on of the connection between Lily's visions and the amulet, whereas it takes Lily more than 100 pages to figure it out.  These minor annoyances didn't prevent Charming Lily from being an entertaining read.	2001-07-07

When Lady Lydia Bedford-Browne set out on a adventure in Texas, she didn't think it would be the adventure of her life.  The straight-laced English woman proved she could take a chance on her life, but she couldn't take a chance on love.  Sam Cody was the only other passenger on her coach when it ran into a terrible accident.  Though they had been stranded, the two decided to do something about it--but what could they do in the middle of nowhere?  The contrasts here between Texas man and English woman are very striking here, but the characterizations go no further than that.  Sexual tension, though well-written, seems to take over the story and to cheapen the relationship these characters could have had.  The adventure, however, is interesting and can satisfy a reader's curiosity.	2001-07-07

She's the granddaughter of the Farqharson's, aged leader of the powerful Clan Farqharson.  The old man wants Anne to become the leader around whom all Scotsmen can rally. As head of the clan she would choose the man to lead their troops, and most hope she would choose John MacGillivray, her friend since childhood, one who had loved her and hoped to marry her.  Anne denies her grandfather's request because, much to her sorrow and embarrassment, her Scottish husband has sworn allegiance to the English.  Angus Moy, Anne's husband and chief of the Clan Chattan, has his reasons for swearing his allegiance to the English.  He is an honorable man and will keep his word though he knows he is driving Anne, the only woman he has ever loved, away.   Anne's emotions and her loyalty become torn as she realizes she is in love with two men.  Author Marsha Canham has done a superb job of bringing to life the conflict brought about by the Scottish/English wars.  The battle scenes are vivid; the love scenes, hot; and the emotional tugs-of-war draining.  The unusual ploy of placing a woman as head of a great Jacobite army works well.  Great read	2001-07-07

With her dog Lady Gwenth, she sets out for what she hopes will be a true adventure.   Her travels lead her to the very men who are looking for her.  Colin of Shanekill is the leader of the group.  On orders from his Master, Eric the Devil, who was ordered by the King, Colin searches for  the elusive Lady Hope.  Hope, who now goes by the name of Harold, meets Colin as she is attempting to steal something to eat from his camp.  He invites Harold to stay with him and his camp of men and continue with them to Shanekill. She knows she must leave before they arrive to Shanekill.  Irish Hope pulls the reader along with the adventures of Lady Hope as Harold.  The energy and realism that Lady Hope gives off is exciting and thrilling to read.  The disappointment comes toward the end of the story when the author introduces a new character and had the secondary characters entangled in a new plot.  This came along when the story should have been packaged, tied up in ribbon and topped with a bow.	2001-07-07

Mason St. Clair, Earl of Ashlin, had a title, very little money, and three nieces who were eligible for marriage but needed to be made  &quot;suitable&quot; for potential husbands.          The woman he finds  for this training is Riley Fontaine, an actress and woman of questionable  reputation.  Though she has little money herself, what she does have is  personality and quite a temper.            Although this book has its  amusing moments, perhaps the story would have been better served if it  stuck closer to its chilling prologue.  The characters here were rather  superficial, and Riley seemed to be the only person of any substance here.   We hope Ms. Boyle's next book will be truer to its introduction.	2000-09-20

Her mother died soon after, and Corinna  was left with nothing of her mother but the coin.  Many years later,  Corinna lives with her aunt and cousin in Boston as a Cinderella-type  drudge.  Her cousin, however, is no wicked stepsister, and they are  planning a daring escape-at-the-altar plan for cousin Katie.  Katie is to  marry Edward Grant, a loathsome man with a loathsome father--and a handsome  half-brother, Stuart.  Since Stuart nearly runs Corinna over with his  carriage, they have shared a relationship sparked with antagonism--and  attraction.  When Corinna is instrumental in Katie's elopement, an event  humiliating to both of the families involved--Stuart finds himself helping  Corinna while helping himself, first in an engagement of convenience, then  a marriage of convenience.  While they both fall in love, lack of  communication prevents them from sharing their feelings. Also, someone is  trying to kill Stuart and doesn't care who gets in the way.

So why did she feel so devastated when her glamorous,  flamboyant younger sister arrived at their Aunt Catherine's home with the  elegant Antonio de la Barca in tow?  Just because he didn't remember her  hanging onto his every words during that wonderful summer lecturing tour in  New York City didn't mean that she didn't wish her sister all the  happiness.  Or did it? And why was her Aunt Catherine looking at him with  horror written all over her face?  Antonio knew the moment he walked  into that old house in East Sussex that it contained some very old  disturbing vibrations.  It wasn't the house itself; it was the people in  the house.  Somehow they were connected to the ghost that was haunting his  place in Madrid.  And he was determined to find out why and how they were  connected.  Brenda Joyce has done an outstanding job in combining  romance, torrid sex, murder, mystery, and ghost hunting in a novel that  takes place in modern times, but has flashbacks scenes into Victorian  England to explain the history.  It is artfully done without confusing the  reader as to who is who.  Definitely a best seller!	2000-09-06

Mike has moved out of the house he shared with his wife of ten years,  having been &quot;kicked to the curb&quot; as his cousin Drew so eloquently  put it.

But he hadn't counted on his tall,  beautiful landlady  with the cool, shy demeanor.  He is immediately drawn  to her and wants to protect her. Terra wants to play it safe. Ms. Green  captures the intensity of building a relationship between two people who  are healing from past wounds and how they must navigate to find the love  they both so richly deserve.  With a secondary love story going on with  Drew and Tera's best friend, Margaret, and bringing back the six Crawford  men from two of the author's other books, this was a winner.	2000-09-06

This super dense rock probably came from a collapsing  star.   Only about 25 feet across, it weighs 25,000 tons or almost 6 tons  per cubic foot.  Moving it would be a task compared to the making of the  great pyramids.  Touching the meteor is also fatal because it is a  superconductor at room temperature.  However, only some people are killed.   Finding out why will be the key to everyone's survival.  Naval  Comandante Vallenar of Chile is not fooled by the phony mining claim that  was the mask that hid the true mission.  The meteor was placed on a  modified oil tanker named the Rolvaag which ends up being chased by  Vallenar's outdated but still lethal destroyer.  The Rolvaag heads for  rough water, the Ice Limit, where warmer ocean currents meet the freezing  waters that surround Antarctica, an area oceanographers call the Antarctic  Convergence.

Duncan's  strength of character and wonderful Scottish brogue are a winning  combination.  This reviewer had a ball in the beginning, feeling the rhythm  of the dialogue roll off the tongue.

About one-fourth into The  Heir, and it ceased being a &quot;page-turner&quot;  It does not come close  to the mettle of a Johanna Lindsey story.  There are no sparks flying  between the two amorous characters.  The dialogue is mediocre with a few  bonfide retorts.

Benjamin January was a slave who had been treated brutally by his former  master Simon Fourchet.  Fortunately for him he had been sold to another  master who sent him to Paris where he was educated as both a surgeon and  musician, and given his freedom.  Because people had been hesitant to  patronize a man of color, he had given up his surgery practice.  Now, he  lives off his music, playing at balls and teaching.  He has returned home  to New Orleans, his place of birth, a free man of color.    To  January's amazement Simon Fourchet has come to him for a favor.  It seems  the Fourchet's butler was poisoned by whisky meant for the master.  Someone  is trying to kill Fourchet, and he wants January to pose as a slave and act  as a spy to uncover the guilty parties.  January hates Fourchet and doesn't  want any part of finding out who's trying to kill the man, but Benjamin's  relative points out that if he doesn't do it, all the slaves on Fourchet's  plantation will suffer and probably be sold down the river.  Very  reluctantly, January agrees, and thus begins a whirlwind dive into Hell.   Sold Down the River is rich in description as well as history.  In 1834 New  Orleans January encounters everything from back breaking slave labor to  voodoo rites.  There are so many possible candidates for killing Fourchet,  poor Ben is constantly in a quandary. A former slave as the protagonist and  educated snoop?  Hambly pulls it off with panache.	2000-09-04

This is the sixth book in the series about Trenton, New Jersey's  appealingly inept bounty hunter, Stephanie Plum. In this latest escapade,  she is searching for her friend and fellow bounty hunter, Ranger, a man who  definitely marches to the beat of different drum. Ranger is also sought by  the police for  questioning in the murder of an organized crime figure.  Consider the fact that a couple of men from organized crime are tailing  Stephanie in the hopes that she will lead them to her elusive friend, do  you only just begin to understand her confusion.      Our inept Stephanie  believes Ranger is innocent and if anything, only kills bad guys.  Her  search is complicated by her obvious attraction to him, and simultaneously  to her sometime lover, a vice cop named Joe Morelli.  Add to that  Stephanie's somewhat senile and lovable grandmother who has moved in with  her granddaughter after a fight with her son-in-law, as well as a hamster  who seems to be the most sensible character in the book, and a variety of  unexpected mishaps, and the reader will laugh herself all the way to  solving the mystery. Neat Book!	2000-08-26

Once you've read other offerings, you come to expect dynamic chacterization, a  rock-'em-sock-'em pace along with a surprises thrown in.  Crying Wolf  doesn't quite cut it in all areas.  The characterization is there.   First we meet Freedy, a swimming pool cleaner who just doesn't get it, an  Abrahams' trademark.

On the other end of the spectum is Nat, the mid-west son of a  single parent, basketball playing high school kid whose intelligence and  essay wins him enough money to go to Inverness.  While Freedy  momentarily fades from the picture, Nat goes off to college.  Because he  can't afford to go home for Christmas, he must spend holiday on  campus--until he meets the twins, Grace and Izzy.  The twins, who are  filthy rich, introduce Nat to a seductive new world he could not even begin  to imagine.  They take a jaunt to the Carribeans on the twins' family jet  where Nat meets Leo Uzig, a philosophy professor at Inverness.  From there,  the plot thickens and the pace, which has faltered up to this point, picks  up consideraly.    Under the guidance of the professor, the twins and  Nat become involved in a &quot;harmless&quot; plot that turns deadly very  quickly.	2000-08-26

Divorced from an abusive first  husband, she has recently remarried.  Her new husband is kind and  supportive, a homicide investigator at the sheriff's department.       Although she has been divorced from John Patrick, an obstetrician, for many  years, Goldy, who has a teenage son from her first marriage, also has a  heap of unresolved business to work through.  She must carry this baggage  with her as she attempts to solve the murder of her ex's girlfriend, Suz  Craig.      Suz, the executive vice-president of the local HMO, has many  enemies.  So the answers don't come easily after John Patrick is arrested  for the murder.  Spurred on by their son, who is convinced that his father  is innocent, Goldy reluctantly investigates the murder. Although she is  secretly happy that her ex is finally in jail where he belongs, at least  for acts of violence against her, Goldy begins to question John Patrick's  guilt.      Burdened by her friendship with Patricia, who is close to a  breakdown and seeking revenge for the loss of a newborn she blames on  Goldy's ex, Goldy attempts to solve the mystery of who murdered Suz Craig.   That is, when she is not creating recipes, cooking and baking, and catering  to local patrons in need of her services.      What bothers this reviewer  about Goldy is her inability to move on. She has a wonderful husband with  whom she claims to feel safe, a  successful business, and a son she adores,  but she remains a victim in her relationship with John Patrick, allowing  him to continue to emotionally and physically abuse her without  retribution. Get some counseling, Goldy.       What bothers me about the  book itself is the attention to cooking and baking and recipe-making--not  my cup of tea, but for some readers, it may be just what they're looking  for, an  entertaining mystery spiced up with actual recipes and cooking  hints interspersed in the plot.	2000-08-26

It is comforting to read that we are not alone in our  pain and confusion and that given the circumstances, the turmoil you are  experiencing is quite normal.  As each emotion is explored, the reasons  for them are also examined. An example from another who has suffered the  same misery is given, then the best part--what we can do with and about  those upsetting, hurtful and sometimes hateful feelings that want to pull  us under and drown us.  The chapter continues to describe the emotional  cycles the &quot;dumpers&quot; (the one ending the relationship) and the  &quot;Dumpee&quot; (the one being rejected) go through. Fisher and Alberti  acknowledge not everyone is going to react the same, but no one escapes the  pain. No matter how we are affected, though, we must remember guilt and  rejection are tied to feelings of self-worth and self-love. Build up these  two areas, and we will be less devastated by life's inevitable rejections.    The end of each chapter has a &quot;How Are You Doing?&quot; section. A  list of questions will help us think our way through our dilemmas and offer  ideas with which we can rebuild our lives. I like this book because it  forces us to do something besides sitting around feeling sorry for  ourselves. There are ways to work through relationships that end, and we  have the power and the tools to do it. We don't have to feel helpless. I  like this book because it acknowledges we are not alone with our feelings.  There is light at the end of the tunnel. We can go on to live a normal,  happy life. It gives us hope.	2000-08-21

Captain Izzy Umboto is obviously a loose cannon.  He questions  her sanity as well, for accepting the Patton, a bucket of bolts which  appears to be on its last leg.  Still, Trouble is committed to the Marine  Corps, so he vows to do his best.         Trouble is captured by the slave  drivers who have enslaved farmers to work their crops of illicit drugs.  On  his first night of captivity, he meets a young woman Ruth who embodies  everything he does not want, including love and commitment.  Enduring  torture and humiliation, Trouble and Ruth manage to retain their dignity  and their belief that they will be rescued.  Meanwhile, Captain Izzy is  doing her best to do just that, rescue the men who depended on her.           It comes down to a battle, not to win the war, but to maintain the peace,  and to exact whatever price may be required.  But can peace be worth human  lives and dignity?         Mike Moscoe's The Price of Peace is  action-packed and exciting space adventure, but it's also a love story, an  exploration of the lengths to which sentient beings will go to maintain  power and to maintain dignity, and it's a peek into the human psyche.  The  Price of Peace satisfies on many levels, including just plain  entertainment.	2000-08-21

Lydia goes back home and marries her young man, Menander.            She leads a most solitary life after this. Her husband dies, as does her  son, and she holds herself apart from her daughter.

She has collected several specimens  and all are neatly pinned and labeled.     Daniel Durham has just received  a summons from his estate, he and Freddie need to return to set accounts  right.  But his wife's concern for Maggie has led to his promise to secure  an escort for her to the  intellectual pursuits she'd rather enjoy.  When  he collides with Captain Hawksby, he convinces the captain to serve as  Maggie's escort.  His prayers have been answered.         I enjoyed reading  this second installment of the Durham sisters.  There are three love  story's unfolding concurrently in this book.  Paula Tanner Girard keeps  your attention focused on Maggie and Hawksby, but Ruth's and Rebecca's  romances unfold as well.  I hadn't read the first of the books, so I was  confused by some of the references to the original.  However this story  stands well on its own.	2000-08-20

She is pregnant with her fianc's child, and now she has caught him sleeping with her best  friend.  A wedding to Bryan Pickett is not going to happen.  When her  father Jacob Washington, a prominent businessman and city leader, hears  that his only child is considering having a child out of wedlock, he  insists Patsy either abort or quickly find a husband.  Patsy seriously  considers moving away, since abortion is not an option for her.      Enter  the knight in shining armor in the form of Austin Treadwell who was her  high school sweetheart until her father intervened and broke them up.   Jacob threatened and blackmailed him, and now sixteen years later he is up  in his face again using threats that could ruin his future if he doesn't  marry Patsy.  Austin was a vulnerable boy and had the stigma of being from  the South side, the wrong side of town.  Now he has acquired two degrees  and is a CPA about to enter law school.  Austin has no doubts that Jacob  would use his considerable influence to make trumped up charges stick and  have him thrown in jail. When Austin proposes to Patsy, he cares for her,  but the threat over his head causes him to not give of himself both  emotionally and physically.   Although at times this reviewer had  difficulties with accepting that Austin's strong character could be  intimidated by Patsy father, Ms. Forster's superb writing, well-developed  secondary characters, and her ability to create exciting tension is still  present.	2000-08-20

Rowena would like nothing more than to see Virgie married to Esmond, but  Virgie stuns everyone by declaring she will marry for nothing less than  love.          Opportunity may knock, but the characters here don't quite  know when to answer the door.  The characters were so wrapped up in concern  for themselves that they seemed to forget about each other in the process.   This reviewer saw no sympathy for any of them, and wondered,  quite  frankly, about the relationships among the characters and the relations  between America and Britain in the mid 19th century.	2000-08-20

The second mistake is  getting a bill of divorce passed through Parliament even when the wife  doesn't contest it. Julian Grosvener, Marquis of Sterling, found his  adoring wife in a dishevelled condition.  She had been mauled by a friend  of her husband's.  After being spurned, Averill takes his revenge by  slyly reporting to Julian that he saw her in the library with a man.  Julian assumes she is faithless, sues for divorce, joins the Army and  leaves for the Peninsular War.  Young Lady Miranda Ransford adores  her husband and despises his friends. Then she is accosted by Lord Averill  and rejects him.  His revenge is swift, and her youthful husband believes  the worst.  She runs away and finds shelter with Julian's aunt.  Back  from the Peninsular War and invalided out due to wounds Julian is ready to  make a new life for himself.  He returns home to find his former wife  residing on a neighboring property with his aunt.  Then there is the child.  Whose? And there is his secret mission for the war office.  The lack  of research in this book is astonishing as well as distracting.  I also  despise young Julian's lack of faith and his assumptions.  Andrea Pickens  knows how to write, and she has some feel for the period.  If you are a  lover of Regencies but aren't that much of a stickler for accuracy, you  will enjoy.	2000-08-18

Julie, a senior tax consultant with a  prestigious CPA firm, owned her own home and was raising her 14-year old  brother while her parents dealt with her dad's multiple sclerosis.  The  only thing missing in her life was a man.  Marc.  Marc couldn't believe  his eyes when his former student walked into his shop, stated she was his  new tax advisor and waited to see his books.  Going through his personal  stuff, looking at his bank account, checking his credit cards--it was just  all too much.  And from what he remembered of Julie Gates, she had been a  real airhead in his class. Marc could not reconcile his memories of Julie  in high school with the poised, professional young lady standing before  him.  But there was something about her&amp;#61628;the attraction factor.   This well-written, comedic look at an uptight, overachiever trying to deal  with a slightly kooky CPA from his former life is romance at its best.   Cathy McDavid adds a twist to this tale of a high school crush on a teacher  becoming a wonderful reality by adding an adolescent youngster into the  picture who ends up helping the hero and heroine get together.  The sexual  tension is high, the sex sizzles and the mental flogging done by our  uptight hero is downright hilarious at times.	2000-08-12
