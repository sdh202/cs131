Hong Ying's autobiographical novel gives an in depth picture of `normal' life in China after World War II with its `hypocrite socialism' and its terrible famines. <br />It is a story of a harsh struggle for survival: unabated hunger, nerve-racking promiscuity, lack of privacy, bitter loneliness, lies and denunciations. <br />It is also a tale about growing up in a `strange' family, becoming an adult, discovering sexuality and about the search for one's own roots. <br /> <br />This book shows poignantly the real and direct impact of governmental political and social decisions on people's daily life. It is not less than a `personal' historical sketch with a genuine human touch. <br /> <br />This magisterial novel is bathed in a magical subdued atmosphere. It is written like most `Schubertian' music in a minor key-note. <br />A must read, not only for Chinese scholars. <br />	2005-10-11

Turgenev's strenght is his capacity to arouse genuine emotions in the reader. He is a master in portraiting human moods and psychological tensions, like frustration, disappointment, desperation, rebelliousness, haughtiness, respect, love or sorrow. <br />Developments in conflictual relations between parents and children ('A son is like a lopped-off branch. As a falcon, he comes when he wills and goes where he lists.'), masters and serfs, conservatives and democrats, atheists and believers are pictured through actions, dialogues, duels (physical and oratory), acts, images, comparisons or thoughts. <br /> <br />This book was vehemently criticized by the conservatives in Russia, who were frontally attacked by Turgenev through one of his main characters, the Nihilist Bazarow ('Down with the authorities'), who was 'free from aristocratic prejudice'. <br />For Bazarow, a Slavophil was 'an upholder of patriarchal tyranny' and 'the moral ailments are induced by the wrong sort of education by all sorts of rubbish with which it has been the custom to stuff people's heads.' <br />About the nobility: 'You may respect yourself and yet you sit doing nothing; of what use is that for the bien public?'. <br /> <br />Ultimately, Turgenev's Russian society becomes enlightened: a landowner marries the mother of his child, even if she is a serf. The fundamental question: 'Why we still got all these castes?', is still a major, and sometimes deadly, problem today. <br /> <br />Despite problems like laziness, pilfering and internecine property struggles, Turgenev defends land reforms, which is also a very actual problem. <br /> <br />Although this book is sometimes too sentimental and partly dated, its conflicts are universal and its writing method a model for generations to come. <br /> <br />Not to be missed.	2005-09-11

This is an immortal tale about hybris, love and hate, justice, racism and the responsibilities of scientists.<br />Its fundamental question is: 'Had I the right to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? ... future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.'<br /><br />The 'unhallowed arts' of Frankenstein produce a 'filthy mass that moved and talked', but it is nevertheless a human being with normal human aspirations: 'Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good, misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.'<br />But, Frankenstein is a 'painted bird': 'Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned against me? I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on.'<br />His reaction is : 'If I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear.'<br /><br />Mary Shelley's vision of mankind is far from rosy: 'I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty.' 'A man was considered, except in very rare circumstances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few.' 'Was man yet so vicious and base? I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow.'<br />Her world is one of resentment, racism and jealousy: 'religion and wealth had been the cause of his condemnation.'<br />But, 'how strange is that clinging love we have of life, even on the excess of misery.'<br /><br />Frankenstein is the scion of the evil principle, the invention of a man-scientist and a 'painted bird', who is therefore not accepted by the rest of the human race. His reaction is revenge.<br /><br />This is a great text by an 18 year old.<br />As Oscar Wilde said in 'The Critic as Artist': 'For when a work is finished it has as it were, an independent life of its own, and may deliver a message far other than that which was put into its lips to say'.<br />Some texts become even more important and luminous with time, like this masterpiece.<br /><br />A must read.nto its lips to say'.

Unwanted daughters were peddled as virtual slaves to unknown families. Once sold, a child's destiny was at the whim of the buyer. She had no papers and no rights. Many were subjected to beatings and other abuses. Prostitution or even death were the fate of some child slaves.'<br /><br />The social environment in China is only an epidermic background: 'at least it was now a city without beggars or newspaper-wrapped female baby corpses.'<br /><br />It all ends with a battle for the inheritance.<br /><br />Only for readers interested in wealthy Chinese family questions in the 20th century.	2005-09-07

Unity of similar, equal, useful things. Hence truth and fraternity are also things that go well together.' <br />But, man shows only solidarity if there is a 'personal' gain. Pure altruism is absolutely no option in the struggle for survival. <br /> <br />His picture of mankind is static, too rosy and naive. His belief in the proletariat is obsessive: 'the poor are uncontaminated by greed for property.' Hence, he proposes the abolishing of private ownership of land. <br />'Evil is only everything that prevents millions of people from becoming human.' For Silone, evil is not a basic and intrinsic part of the human character. <br />He doesn't understand that all proletarians want their children to become (not static) doctors, engineers, lawyers, economists ..., in other words 'bourgeois'. <br />In Stalin's Soviet Union, he sees only a fraternity of peasants and workers. <br />The political role of the Catholic Church nowadays is marginalized. In Italy, they even don't have a Christian Party anymore. <br /> <br />Of course, the main character poses certain questions: had that (communist) community not itself become a synagogue? abandoned the critical spirit? the risks of conspirational struggles? <br />His answer is no. He refutes that the communists aspire too to totalitarian power and orthodoxy and that a black inquisition will be followed by a red one. His return to his homeland 'had been basically an attempt to escape that professionalism', and he has the 'hope of one day playing a big role'. <br /> <br />Like a fanatically convinced Christian missionary, he tries desperately to sell his communist gospel to the poor cafoni. Unfortunately, they are terribly conservative ('it has always been so') and his message falls on deaf ears. <br /> <br />What is left in this book are the struggles against a totalitarian (here fascist) regime and against the butchery of war. <br />It is partly very melodramatic (e.g. the confession at the end) and its main symbolism (a marxist apostle disguised as a priest) irrealistic. <br /> <br />I prefer Silone's more direct and less apostolical 'Fontamara' and recommend highly his masterpiece 'Emergency Exit'.	2005-09-05

One time, an organization is called the Central Red Committee, another time, the International Red Committee. A 'Central' Committee seems rather bizarre for anarchists ('I depend on death, which knows no restraint and cannot be attacked. My superiority is evident.')<br /><br />A dialogue between a police chief and a pure anarchist ('looking for the blow to open the first crack in the great edifice of legal conceptions sheltering the atrocious injustice of society') seems improbable, as well as the short love story between Verloc's wife and another anarchist, at the end.<br /><br />However, certain aspects of the novel are very actual, like the use of 'a weak-minded creature with carefully indoctrinated loyalty and blind docility and devotion', to carry out the fatal terrorist attack. Also actual is the following sentence: 'the existence of secret agents should not be tolerated, as tending to augment the positive dangers of evil'.<br /><br />This book has not the same high standard as Conrad's masterpieces like 'Hearth of Darkness' and 'Lord Jim'.<br /><br />Only for Conrad fans.	2005-09-04

I neither had a Heart to ask God's Mercy.'<br /><br />Defoe's work is eminently modern, with his psychological insight 'What a Felicity is it to Mankind that they cannot see into the Hearts of one another', and 'Modest men are better Hypocrites';<br />or, the ravages of alcoholism: 'the Drunk are the Men whom Solomon says, they go like an Ox to the Slaughter, till a Dart strikes through their Liver';<br />and his feminism: 'the Disadvantage of the Women is a terrible Scandal upon Men', and 'Money only made a Woman agreeable.'<br /><br />Defoe's appeal to the reader - 'every Branch of my Story may be useful to honest People' - seems to be a smokescreen to circumvent censorship, because ultimately Moll Flanders prospers.

It has no references and no index. It shows already spelling faults in the names. So, it is not recommendable as a prime source of information for serious scholars.    Nevertheless, its overall picture exposes one clear message: the blatant hypocrisy of the powerful, be they popes, emperors, tsars, kings, queens, princes, Khedives, Shahs, politicians or noblemen. Their maxim is 'Do as I say, not as I do.'  Those who became rich (merchants, movie stars, artists) emulated them (T. Veblen).  It proves mightily that 'power equals women'.    On the other hand, some 'famous' names figuring in thus book are clearly 'victims' of this double standard hypocrisy: child prostitutes, courtesans, members of the demi-monde or findings of the casting couch.    As L. Betzig said in her magisterial book 'Despotism and Differential Reproduction': 'All end of human life is its reproduction, and positions of strenght are exploited to this end.'

Daisy Miller, its main character, shows 'reckless behaviour': 'Flirting with any man she could pick up; sitting in corners with mysterious Italians; dancing all the time with the same partners; receiving visit at eleven o'clock at night. Her mother goes away when visitors come.'  For the American community in Europe, Daisy Miller is 'running absolutely wild'. Her behaviour is totally inadmissible and abnormal.  But, no problem, morality is saved. Daisy visits the Colosseum, a nest of malaria, with her Italian friend. She dies a week later, not without leaving a message that 'she would have reciprocated one's affection', that of a solid American, who 'had an old attachment for the little metropolis of Calvinism'. Death is a well-deserved punishment for a 'POOR girl'.    For Henry James, Daisy's mixture of 'audacity, puerility and innocence is inscrutable.'    This moralist story can be read in all school classes studying Victorian upper class conventions.	2005-08-22

He is killed by his own robot. The whole tower crashes in an earthquake. <br />'The Encantadas' are 'Apples of Sodom'. <br /> <br />Herman Melville's worldview is that of a true calvinist. His religion is the dominant theme in these stories: 'All is owing to Providence' (BC), also the alleged superiority of the white man. After the Fall, man became naturally depraved. More, 'civilization is auspicious to depravity, because the latter can fold itself in the mantle of respectability.' (BB) <br />Melville's anti-rational, anti-scientific and anti-progress stance is clearly exposed in the fate of Bannadonna and his realisations(BT). <br /> <br />So, why should we still read an outspoken 19th century conservative author? Because Calvinism poses the fundamental question of evil-'owing to Providence'. Melville is obsessed by evil. For him, it is an irrational 'mystery, a matter for psychologic theologians.' (BB) <br /> <br />Melville is a master in staging characters driven by 'pale ire, envy, despair' (BB) or 'pride' (BT). The deception in BC is formidably sketched; the indomitable reaction of the stuttering Billy Budd is a lightning blow and the suicidal behaviour of Bartleby is baffling. <br />These are the main reasons why some of his stories continue to be fascinating reads. <br />	2005-08-18

Man is irrational. He is governed by the heart, not the brain, but the heart can be innocent or evil: <br />'though the man's even temper and discreet bearing seem to intimate a mind peculiarly subject to the law of reason, not the less in his heart he would seem to riot in complete exemption from the law, having apparently little to do with reason further than to employ it as an ambidexter implement for effecting the irrational. These men are true madmen.' <br />More, civilization is auspicious to natural depravity. It folds itself in the mantle of respectability. <br /> <br />The innocent Billy Budd (Adam before the Fall) is a victim of profound iniquity (pale ire, envy, despair) and his reaction is indomitable. <br />Starry Vere (fron the Latin 'Verus'), the captain of the ship, agrees that iniquity is a mystery, a matter for psychologic theologians, but for a military court only the prisoner's deed must be taken into account. <br /> <br />Herman Melville, as a true calvinist, is obsessed by the existence of evil.

It makes the reader relentlessly guessing what is really going on and what happened to the inmates of the shipwreck 'San Dominick'. <br />Unfortunately, it is a racist tale. Herman Melville accepts without discussion the 19th century belief in the superiority of the white man. <br />The black inmates are characterized as 'the docile arising from the unaspiring contentment of a limited mind ... undisputable inferiors.' <br />They are crushed by the good whites personified in Captain Delano, 'a person of a singularly undistrustful good nature ... a benevolent heart, more than ordinary quickness and accuracy of intellectual perception'. <br />More, the story exposes his author as a true calvinist, a fatalist: 'All is owing to Providence!', also the macabre message on the prow of the shipwreck 'follow your leader' (to be killed). <br /> <br />On the contrary, 'Bartleby' is a profoundly modern tale. <br />The strange behaviour of its main character 'Bartleby' can be described as 'perfectly harmless passivity' : 'I would prefer not to.' <br />The reason for this behaviour lays in the fact that Bartleby was suddenly removed out of the 'Dead Letter' office in Washington after a reorganization. <br />'Dead letters! does it not sound like dead men? ...

A woman promises God that if she has a son, he will become a priest. But the adolescent has absolutely no call to become a padre. On the contrary, he falls in love with a beauty.  In order to escape from the holy vow, the Church agrees in a most jesuitic way that if a substitute is found, the promise will be fulfilled.  The subsequent marriage turns out not to be the paradise hoped for.    This book contains some mild criticism of the Church with its paternosters and Ave Marias as penances for committed sins. The pact with God is treated as a commercial note: 'The Creditor (God) was a multimillionnaire; He was not dependent upon payment in order to eat, and consented to postponements without even increasing the rate of interest.'  'Jehovah is a Rothschild, only much more human: he does not make moratoriums, he pardons the debt in full, provided the debtor truly wished to mend his ways'.    The sex is also very innocent ('silk garters') compared to today's eccentricities.    The confession of the main character is not without some acrid self-mockery: 'The Church has established in the confessional the most authorative of legal services and in confession the most trustworthy of instruments for the adjustment of moral accounts between man and God. But my incorrigible timidity closed this sure door to me. How a man changes! Today I go so far as to publish it.'    The overall picture of Brazil at the end of the 19th century is appalling: poverty, leprosy, slavery, the all importance of the catholic Church. But for the author, this state of affairs is in no way exceptional.    This book is a worth-while read.	2005-08-16

It is history with a moving human touch, a gripping physical tale.  As an example, her analysis of the Cultural Revolution is outstanding: A bunch of arrogant children of high CP officials creates a pro-Mao movement. The master manipulator Mao uses them for the creation of a youth army and for the smashing of his political opponents. Millions of innocent Chinese are slaughtered, crippled or humiliated in an eight year wave of senseless (not for Mao) turmoil and social upheaval ( no doctors, no teachers, no scientists, no musicians...).  The CR shows that for Mao individual lives (except his own) were totally unimportant. Paramount was that he retained his power.    Jung Chang's book is a history of old and new feudalism. In the old one, there were warlords (and before, an emperor), in the new one, a party leader.  In both feudalisms, power was a synonym for survival in the struggle for life. It meant food, shelter, women, an army, loyal followers, perfect bureaucrats. The most 'cunning' survived in the brutal power struggles.  The author's portrait of Mao's character is profoundly characteristic: 'He was a restless fight promoter. He understood ugly human instincts such as envy and resentment and knew how to mobilize them for his ends. He ruled by getting people to hate each other. Mao had managed to turn people into the ultimate weapon of dictatorship.'    The missionaries of the communist gospel, like her father, a loyal and honest party bureaucrat, were killed (literally or psychologically) by the opportunists, careerists and cynics, who instinctively understood that power is an end, not a means, for instance, to better the living standard of the population.    During Mao's reign the overall atmosphere in China was FEAR ('people did not dare even to think'). In Mao'a paradise (not that of his subjects) disinformation and total censorship were the law in order to keep the Chinese population under his yoke.    The similarities with Stalin's Soviet Union are all too evident.    Jung Chang's mighty portrait of three generations of female victims of dictatorship (today still the most common form of government in the world) is an indirect cry for democracy.    This book is a must read.	2005-08-15

E.g., Roberto Calvi, chairman of the Banco Ambrosiano knew that Mason Licio Gelli (P2) had laundered money to buy exocet-rockets for the Argentinians, which were used in the Falklands war against Great-Britain. Or, the Swiss banks are holding on to their secrecy, because the money in secret accounts becomes their property if no transactions are registered in the account during a period of 20 years. <br /> <br />His overall picture of the drug industry is another matter. The drug industry is bigger than the food industry worldwide with  quite staggering amounts of money involved. <br />More, drugs were (are) used officially and politically by the mujahedin in Afghanistan in their war against the Soviet-Union, by the Vietnamese in their war against the USA and by the CIA to finance some of their secret operations (see Peter Dale Scott's 'Drugs, Oil and War'). <br />For the author, the drugs war cannot be won. <br /> <br />The other war, against money laundering, became a whole other matter after the 9/11 attacks. Even the Swiss agreed to open private bank acounts for criminal investigations. <br />The 40 million dollars bills rotting in a Californian basement could be small money compared to the amount of 'black' cash actually in circulation worldwide.

By dissecting rites, ceremonies, festivities and mysteries, she exposes the real obsessions of the Ancient Greek (Plato included). Instead of being 'possessed by a set of conceptions based on Periclean Athens', she shows astonishingly that Ancient Greece was still a totally irrational, savage and primitive society, dominated by ignorance and fear. Her picture is far more gloomy than the rosy one drawn by other scholars, who imposed their own language on ancient societies ('We should not monotheize').<br /><br />In Ancient Greece, there was no 'civil' law. Law was essentially magic and in the first place a curse. People thought that they could injure their enemies by curse tablets, swathed figures ... In Plato's 'Laws', people who injured other citizens by magic had to die.<br /><br />Ignorance and fear concerning the souls of the death, sprites, ghosts and demons were a fertile ground for theology (better: demonology). Evil spirits reflected the population's own savage, cruel and irrational passions and relations. (Porphyry: 'No Greek sacrifice of a camel or an elephant').<br />The Greek believed that evil was a physical infection that could be transferred on animals and human beings. The latter could be sacrificed in order to purify the rest of the population. One is astonished to learn that human sacrifices still took place in the 5th century BC. 'Pharmakoi' were kept and fed at the public expense in order to be slaughtered in rites of Aversion (riddance of evil spirits).<br />Winds were believed to be ghosts who had to be placated by sacrifices. The latter (humans were better than animals) took also place for mandic reasons.<br /><br />In Greek theology, there were 'no gods at all', only conceptions of the human mind. Theology's formulary was 'panta rei'.<br />New gods developed out of heroes or crystallized out of a gentler form of ghost or were imported from other regions. One of the new gods was Dionysos coming from Thrace. He was the god of all growing things and of physical intoxication. His double was the god of spiritual intoxication: Orpheus (Orphism). The latter Mystery had a profound influence on Plato and his theory of the immortality of the soul (essentialism).<br /><br />The author's analysis of the Eleusian Mysteries and Orphism are interesting but partly out-of-date, because new sources of information were discovered after the publication of her book.<br />For Eleusis I recommend G.

(Sinica Leidensia, Volume LVII)	Books	5	26	28	N	N	No guilt	The ancient Chinese believed that human sexuality was analogous to 'cosmic' procreation. They saw absolutely no difference between rain wetting a field and semen fertilizing the womb of a woman, or between a damp soil ready for sowing seed and a moist vagina ready for penetration. <br />Their sexuality was never tainted by morality (guilt) and could never be a sin. <br /> <br />The ancient Chinese palette went from the most detailed biological pictures of copulation to the most spiritual experiences of love. <br /> <br />However, there were important differences between confucianism, taoism and tantrism. <br />The most conformist way of life was confucianism, which believed in biological immortality through offspring. Marriage was an important institution, but not an occasion for rejoicing. Music was prohibited for three days, because it was considered as a signal for the father that his son would soon take his place! <br />Taoists believed in physical immortality and tried to prolong life through different techniques: respiration (mastering the uterine respiration of the embryo), diets, gymnastics or heliotherapy imposing a harsh body regimen for its adepts. <br />A taoist 'alchemist' sect considered the woman's womb as a kind of chemist's cup capable of fabricating 'Life's Elixir' through copulation. <br />Certain sects organized mass copulations trying to put their followers in a mystical delirium and making them believe that they were invulnerable and invincible in combat. Powerful men used them in this sense for political goals. <br /> <br />Tantrism was a more difficult practice. Sexual intercourse had to take place when a woman was most fertile, but the man had to withhold ejaculation (coitus reservatus) in order to capture the yin of the woman and heighten his own vital powers. <br /> <br />Robert van Gulik (author of excellent 'Chinese' detective novels) treats this particularly difficult theme masterly. <br />He wrote a most stimulating book, not only forChinese scholars.	2005-08-08

He is the lonely hero who considers that what he did was 'a more than criminal weakness', not 'honest faith' or the expression of 'the instinct of courage'. <br />He (one of us) stood alone within the bunch of criminal whites (us) and above the innocent savages (them). <br />For Joseph Conrad, his fate is the result of 'the implacable destiny of which we are the victims and the tools.' <br /> <br />One of the villains in this book, Brown, foreshadows the main character in Conrad's magisterial novel 'Heart of Darkness'. <br /> <br />This book is not without some melodramatic effects (an idyllic love affair) or superlatives ('eyes as immensely deep wells'); however, it is a great novel by an ambitious author.	2005-08-04

He understood also that the SU military budget constituted a heavy drag on the whole soviet economy. <br />For the CEE, he saw big problems ahead: a crazy agricultural regime, no independent military force and splintered economic and monetary policies. Only one of these problems has been partly solved today. <br />This book shows also the importance of think tanks: the Council of Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the London Institute for Strategic Studies, the Bilderberg Conferences and the Library Group which was co-founded by him. <br /> <br />H. Schmidt was also a brilliant economist with his magical rectangular: price stability, growth, high employment and foreign trade equilibrium. <br /> <br />His sworn enemy was US President Jimmy Carter. The latter wanted that Germany inflated its economy and that it stopped its export of nuclear reactors. He threatened to block the delivery of enriched uranium with the risk of an energy black-out in the whole of Germany. <br />H. Schmidt also opposed a recall of Western credits to Poland during the Jaruzelski regime.

All physical action cannot be properly simulated computationally.  Even if it can, computational simulation cannot by itself evoke qualia.    I believe G. Edelman that the mind is a matter of matter and that consciousness is an emergent phenomenon.  In John Boslough's 'Steven Hawking's Universe', Steven Hawking said: 'Even if we do achieve a complete unified theory, we shall not be able to make detailed predictions in any but the simplest situations.'  And, J. von Neumann & H.H.Goldstine stated: 'a mathematical formulation NECESSARILY (I underline) represents only a (more or less explicit) theory of some phase (or aspect) of reality, and not reality itself.' (Quoted in K. Popper - The Open Universe)    More, computation is Lamarckian. If we program even very sophisticated robots, they will live in their own reality. A computer does not attain any genuine understanding of what he is actually doing.  Human understanding is not an algorithmic activity. Human behaviour is in its essence not rational. It is Darwinian (look what is happening all over the world).    A big part of this book is also based on the wave function in quantum mechanics.  The decoherence theory explains clearly that continuity (waves) does not exist in the universe. The waves collapsed : 'The constant bombardment of objects by constituents of their environment reduces the probabilities inherent to quantum mechanics to coin tosses and roulette wheels' (Brian Greene). Everything in the universe is discrete, even time (Lee Smolin). Schroedinger's cat is dead or alive. Not both.    Even if I cannot always agree (or comprehend) with the author, I consider this book as a brilliant achievement. It contains a wealth of information (e.g. Goedel) and is thought-provoking.    N.B. For Platonism, see my comment on 'The Emperor's New Mind'.	2005-08-02

Edelman explains clearly in his brilliant book 'Bright Air, Brilliant Fire' that mind is a matter of matter. Consciousness is an emerging characteristic of life after a long evolution. <br />Popper's system of 3 Worlds is also flawed (World 1: physical world - brain physiology; World 2: subjective thought - human consciousness; World 3: objective thought - theories), because World 1 and 2 are the same. <br /> <br />His arguments against philosophical and scientific determinism are powerful, but scientifically speaking Laplace's demon is a joke. As Steven Hawking explains in John Boslough's 'Steven Hawking's Universe': 'Even if we do achieve a complete unified theory, we shall not be able to make detailed predictions in any but the simplest situations.' <br />Predictions will be limited to the extreme and determinism will be non-existant in brain physiology (Mozart's G minor symphony could not have been predicted). Indeterminism will be all the more true in the social sciences (historicism). <br />Indeterminism is a cardinal characteristic of matter: all singular events in this world are unique, free. <br /> <br />It is very strange that some of the brightest scientific minds (Einstein, Schroedinger) were staunch defenders of determinism (see Popper's discussions with Einstein on p. 90-92). <br />The fact that Einstein changed his mind at the end of his life is not confirmed in M. Jammer's book 'Einstein and Religion'. <br /> <br />On the other hand, Popper's remark on the arrow of time is to-the-point: 'As to the arrow of time, it is in my opinion a mistake to make the second law of thermodynamics responsible for its direction. Even a non-thermodynamic process, such as the propagation of a wave from a centre, is in fact irreversible.' <br /> <br />Very important is note 3 on p. 43. J. von Neumann, H.H. Goldstine: 'a mathematical formulation necessarily represents only a (more or less explicit) theory of some phase (or aspect) of reality, not reality itself.' <br /> <br />I recommend this book only for Popper fans.	2005-07-30

Cobban gives us his vision of the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI and the French Revolution.

The actions of the revolutionaries were prescribed by the need to find practical solutions to immediate problems.' <br />The central theme of his book is 'bread' (famine) for the Third Estate and 'financial crisis' for the powerful in the Old Regime. The financial crises were provoked by war (e.g. the American War) and the refusal by the wealthy (aristocracy, Church) to pay taxes. <br />Other factors were the weakness of the kings and the functioning of the Old Regime with its bureaucratic control of industry and trade. <br /> <br />Louis XVI had to summon the States-General, which permitted the Third Estate to take power (normally it was always in a minority position of 2 against 1). But immediately, there were internecine fights between the different factions in it. The Committee of Public Safety eliminated the right (Danton) and the left, but the members of the Committe then fought among themselves: Robespierre was guillotined. In fact, 85 % of the guillotined belonged to the Third Estate. <br />When the new revolutionary army became sufficiently professionalized, the political role of the people was finished. The well-to-do within the Third Estate, who had used the discontent of the peasants and the craftsmen, could lean on the army to take power, until one of the generals rose above everybody and became France's new autocrat. <br /> <br />Of course, this small book cannot give detailed explanations of all events or insightful portraits of all important characters, but it is told with dash, insight and vision. <br />It would not have been written had the Church still ruled, because the Vatican attacked vehemently the 'monstrous right to liberty of thought and writing.' <br /> <br />A masterly told tale about 'the nursery of the modern world'.	2005-07-29

He saw in them (not quite) the first critical rationalists by analyzing a few written sentences. His statements are very bold long-shots, indeed. He learned ancient Greek because he felt that classical scholars gave bad translations of ancient philosophical texts. <br /> <br />For Parmenides, human opinion of appearances is based on our senses, which are totally misleading. We should 'by reason alone decide on the often-contested argument'. <br />His world vision was as follows: 'Only what is, is; nothingness cannot exist; the world is full; motion is impossible'. <br /> <br />This totally false vision was criticized by Heraclitus for whom there are no things, only changes, processes. <br /> <br />Another of Popper's favourites was Xenophanes, in which he saw the father of epistemology, because 'for all is but a woven web of guesses.' <br />More famous is Xenophanes's insight that human ideas of gods are vitiated by anthropomorphism: <br />The Ethiops say that their gods are flat-nosed and black ... <br />horses would draw their gods like horses... and each would then shape bodies of gods in the likeness of its own. <br /> <br />Popper also explains tentatively the importance of geometry for Plato: the discovery of irrational numbers destroyed the Pythagorean arithmetic and Plato sought to replace this arithmetical theory by a geometrical one. <br /> <br />Speaking of modern philosophy, he scorns the use of an ununderstandable and impressive language. 'Most philosophers who made 'ontology' their business got nowhere'. <br />In his remarks on Maxwell's demon, one should take into account the energy needed for operating the shutter. <br />The Boltzmann story is better told in 'Unended Quest'. <br />A basic knowledge of probability theory is needed in order to understand the important issue of 'how induction becomes counter-induction'. <br /> <br />This book contains a lot of repetitions: 3 essays on Parmenides tell the same story and one essay is a very light adaptation of a chapter of 'The Self and its Brain'. <br /> <br />Although some parts of this book are interesting, I recommend it only for Popper fans and also, partly, for Greek scholars. <br />	2005-07-26

I used to see the best in every-one', becomes 'my growing selfishness, this was probably maturity.' 'Life would never be a simple question of self-denial again.' <br /> <br />There is also the chasm between the education's view of mankind and the facts of real life. <br />Education was the cause of 'my inability to see anything in human terms of like and dislike, love and hate, but only in terms of justice, guilt and innocence', and 'the endurance of privation is a virtue.' <br />However as an adult, she is confronted with 'resentments breed so near the craddle, that people should have it from birth'; 'facts of inequality, of the heart-breaking uneven hardship of the human lot. These things were as nothing compared with the bond that bind parent and child'. <br />As another woman in the novel says: 'I haven't the energy to go worrying about other people's children. I only have enough time to worry about myself. If I didn't put myself and mine first, they wouldn't survive.' <br /> <br />And finally, there is the unbearable burden of Victorian religion: 'the thought of sex freightened the life out of me.' 'If Octavia were to die, this would be a vengeance upon my sin.' <br /> <br />In naturally flowing prose, Margaret Drabble paints a most human portrait of innocence and struggle for (emotional) survival, youth and adulthood and the mighty marks of religion (guilt) and 'unselfish' education. <br /> <br />A masterly written short novel.	2005-07-24

The IR was not only an acceleration of growth, but an acceleration of growth through economic and social transformation. <br />It was also solidly founded on political and military pillars. <br />Politically, the kings were subordinated to Parliament, which was controlled by an oligarchy of landowning capitalist aristocrats. The British government based nearly all its policies on economic ends. At home, it provided support for technical innovation and the development of the capital goods industry. It crushed also foreign competition. Its foreign policies were based on war and colonization, which permitted to capture other countries' export markets. <br />Militarilly, it used the strenght of its Navy as a trade-minded weapon. <br /> <br />The first phase of the IR (1780-1840) was based on cotton; the second one on coal, iron and steel. <br />It constituted for nearly the whole British population a fundamental change, from the countryside to the city, and from a life of bare and uncertain subsistence to relative affluence. <br /> <br />The decline began already before WWI, when Britain became a parasitic economy, living off the remains of world monopoly. <br /> <br />The last part of the book is rather more an enumeration of pure statistics. <br /> <br />The author states also that Britain was 'never defeated in war, still less destroyed.' <br />In his magnificent biography of J.M. Keynes (part II), Prof. Skidelsky shows clearly that the debt contracted during WWII left Britain bankrupt after the war. His analysis of the negotiations about the Bretton-Woods system and the conversion of the British debt exposes mightily that the ultimate goal of the US Administration was the destruction of the British Empire and its Commonwealth ties. The US operation was a sound success. <br />The US assured its place as new world leader, until now. <br /> <br />A highly recommended book.	2005-07-22
156074:US	37010568	RID6WGNMI8HHT	0127859241	684236957	The Modern World-System II: Mercantilism and the Consolidation of the European World-Economy, 1600-1750 (Studies in Social Discontinuity)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Monumental	The central idea in this monumentally documented (220 pages of references for 200 pages of text) study is that a 'Cumulative self-sustaining change in the form of endless search for accumulation has been the leitmotiv of the capitalist world-economy since its genesis in the 16th century.' <br /> <br />The 17th century history was determined by the struggle for the surplus-value between states and classes. <br />States tried to concentrate all the major sources of capitalist profits within their frontiers in order to become the centre (core) state: cereals, textile, metallurgical products, transport infrastructure, entrepots of the Atlantic trade. <br />The core country tried to use other countries as conveyors (semi-peripheries) of the created surplus-value in the peripheries. <br />Within the emerging core state, classes battled among themselves for a major part of this surplus-value. <br /> <br />In the beginning of the 17th century, Holland (the Seventeen Provinces) became the centre of the European economy, which dominated the world. <br />Its position was first attacked by the Navigation Act (1651). It was ultimately replaced by England, which had defeated France (Treaty of Paris -1763). <br /> <br />The 17th century saw the emergence of a new class: the bourgeoisie. In England, an eventual power struggle for the surplus-value between the bourgeoisie and the landowner aristocrats was avoided through a political compromise. More, the king lost his power to the Parliament, which was controlled by the capitalist classes. Merchants, financiers and landowner aristocrats could work together for the exploitation of the world economy. <br />The 17th century saw also the emergence of proto-industrialization: many small producers engaged in cottage industry and rural wage work. <br /> <br />I believe that this extremely solidly underpinned study has a major flaw: 'the endless search for accumulation' is not an end, but a means. As Robert Kuttner said: 'Wealth is power.'Power means a bigger chance to survive (as a state, a union, a unit or an individual) in the struggle for life. <br />Power is not only a question of social\economic systems, but also a matter of political, military or technological strenght. <br /> <br />Why did Britain conquer the waves? Politically, the capitalists controlled the Parliament and could implement their policies. Militarilly, the Navy's strenght assured victory in wars and permitted access to markets or a blocking of the entry of raw materials directly into enemy states. Socially, there was a compromise between the powerful classes. Technologically, the proto-industrialization would cumulate into the Industrial Revolution, which assured Britain's core status for a long time to come. <br /> <br />This book contains a wealth of information and is thought-provoking, but somewhat one-sided. <br />Highly recommended.	2005-07-20

Because the transition from feudalism to capitalism had long since occurred. <br /> <br />I will only discuss the author's view on the Industrial Revolution. <br /> <br />Another marxist, Eric Hobshawm starts his book 'Industry and Empire' with the following sentence: 'The Industrial Revolution marks the most fundamental transformation of human life in the history of the world.' <br /> <br />How is it possible that two marxist scholars have such a different appreciation of the same phenomenon? <br />I believe because there is an all important 'hidden' element, which is unconsciously taken into account by Hobshawm and not by Wallerstein: power. <br />'The endless search for accumulation' is not an end, but a means to acquire power (R. Kuttner: 'Wealth is power.') <br />Power means a bigger chance to survive in the struggle for life. Those, then and now, who profit from the Industrial Revolution have a better chance to survive (states, corporations, classes, individuals). <br />Power is not only a question of social and economic systems, but also a matter of political and military strenght in order to implement certain policies. <br /> <br />Why did Britain rule the waves? Politically, the Parliament controlled the king and the capitalist landowners could implement their economic policies. Militarilly, the Navy's strenght assured victory in wars, permitted access to foreign markets, incorporation of vast new zones into the system, blocking entry of raw material into enemy states ... Economically, all important technical innovations. <br />The Industrial Revolution was a crucial element in the acquisition of world power by the British. <br /> <br />Wallerstein admits these cardinal factors: 'It was these politico-military victories that critically increased the economic gaps  - in industry, in trade and in finance.' And, 'the wars allowed the spectacular change in Britain's exports.' <br />But, because they did not change the system (capitalism), those factors were not very important. Also in the struggle for survival? <br /> <br />Another aspect of both analyses is the Schumpeterian factor. For Wallerstein, the actors are ideas, classes, Estates. Individuals are mere vehicles for those ideas. <br />In Hobshawm's book, individuals are important, e. g. the aim of the British rulers was to implement first of all policies of economic expansion. This was not the aim of the Ottoman empire. <br /> <br />This book contains a wealth of information and is thought-provoking, but one-sided. <br />Ultimately, only democracy can determine the future of our world-system.	2005-07-19

They spend more time protecting their budgets and their establishments and invent new justifications for their existence.' <br />For the author, 'open, published information and that obtained through traditional contacts have proved more useful.' <br /> <br />He illustrates his thesis profusely with examples where nobody trusts and believes nobody. Even specialized authors can only give hypotheses about what really went on: the Hollis affair, the Penkovsky - Nosenko - Golitsyn defections, the Sorge spy ring (Stalin didn't believe Sorge when he cabled the exact date of the Barbarossa invasion), the Lucy spy ring, the Kim Philby affair (discovered only after nearly 30 years). <br /> <br />Intelligence agencies have become wellsprings of power in our society, secret clubs for the privileged. Their cost is prohibitive, but the powerful are ready to protect their privileges at any cost  ... for the entire population. <br />If democratic regimes constitute a threat for their holdings (mostly oil) or their credo (no distributive taxation), intelligence services will intervene. Some of these interventions were highly effective indeed (the PM Wilson affair in Great-Britain, Indonesia, Guatemala, the Philippines, Colombia, the Shah's Iran), at least in the short run. In the long run, they turn whole populations against the US. <br /> <br />That 'any global group of this size must be intensely concerned with its survival', can be illustrated by the fate of President Kennedy, who wanted to 'splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.' <br />The culprits behind the assassination are clearly exposed in Gregory Douglas's book 'Regicide', based on the memoirs of CIA chief Angleton, one of the main characters in this book. <br /> <br />Although written before the fall of the Berlin Wall, this is still a very topical book about 'freedom and democracy' in the world. It reads like a thriller. <br />It contains also certain corrections on the author's former book 'The Philby Conspiracy'.	2005-07-18

Basic needs: metabolism (food), reproduction (sex), corporeal well being (cleaning), security (cloths), activity (games), growth (of offspring), health (medecine).  Universal institutional types: reproduction (marriage), territory (city), physiology (gender), spontaneous associations (secret clubs), profession (sorcerer), upbringing (learning), health (hospitals).    Anthropology studies also the functions of the different institutions as well as evolutionary aspects (transformations of institutions).

The West promised the colonized peoples equal rights, but it refuses to give them a share of world power and wealth and even national liberty. <br /> <br />An essay discusses the works of James Frazer (The Golden Bough), which influenced mightily the theories of Freud. Today, these studies are considered as unscientific, although very interesting. <br /> <br />Malinovski's work has also a very important flaw: he believes that the work of Kropotkin (cooperation) rendered Darwin's theory more or less obsolete. For a clear explanation of the influence of Darwinism on anthropological transformations, I recommend 'Genes, Mind, and Culture' by C. Lumsden and E.O.

If that needs a remake of the world, they will do it, otherwise not. <br />By the way, this is also the aim of consultancy firms and one of the reasons why responsible officers are so suspicious of them, seeing the huge fees involved. <br />These officers need them if they want to implement their own policies, but need to present them as necessary measures proposed by outsiders. <br /> <br />The author has also no problem with an amoral market: 'selling grain overseas for a better price ... while people in the village were hungry ... You gave up your loyalty to the village for loyalty to an impersonal exchange that ... would better everyone in the long run.' <br />He forgets that in the short run people in the village (could) starve.  <br /> <br />This book treats on the same level, consumer activist Ralph Nader, oil planner Pierre Wack, nonrationalist and LSD-mysticist Willis Harman, futurist Herman Kahn, social psychologist Kurt Lewin, 'kundabuffer' Ivan Gurdjieff, the developers of the 'Managerial Grid' and F-groups or the authors of the Report of the Club of Rome; all this under the superficial dressing of some Middle Age philosophies. <br /> <br />Some ideas developed in this book are important: democratic leadership based on dialogue, group dynamics, the importance of listening and respect, community and self-organized teams, shareholder activism or Jay Forrester's model about the interrelationship between population and economic growth, environment, technology and human aspirations. <br /> <br />It exposes also Herman Kahn's optimistic future where everyone would be affluent and have the chance to be educated.

'Perfect competition is not only impossible, but inferior.' <br />He turns the 'Revealed Preference' (markets serve free choices and aggregate welfare) into Bertrand de Jouvenel's 'Revealed Ignorance'. Corporations have the power to set prices, not to take them passively. <br />What we need is a mixed economy: a balance between market, state and civil society. In fact, the US has a long history of governmental interventionism. <br /> <br />The author illustrates his credo forcefully by examining a whole range of all important industries and markets. <br />Free markets and/or deregulation are not a solution for <br />- the health care sector (the most efficient way to make a profit is to avoid sick people and to limit care) <br />- the money market (the S & L disaster) <br />- the labor market (is a reflexion of the relative power between the capital owner and the salary worker. After loosing his job, the latter is three months away from destitution) <br />- the airline industry (deregulation has degraded service in multiple ways) <br />- the environment (global warming, acid rain and deforestation cannot be solved by market forces) <br />- telecommunications (major sectors are natural monopolies) <br />- electricity (the final sale remains a true natural monopoly) <br />- education (a paramount source of long-term economic growth) <br />- safe and health in the workplace (that's why Congress wrote OSHA). <br /> <br />He cleverly explains the motives behind 'laissez faire' policies. As Robert Heilbroner said 'Ideology is part of economics'. <br />'Wealth buys among other things power and power resists income distribution.' <br />The champions of false evangelism are for the author the Public Choice cynics. He unmask them as fundamental anti-democrats, because they believe that 'politics is hopelessly self-defeating'. <br />However, he notes that its representatives are very congenial to the most powerful and poses the rhetoric question: Who looses when society pursues political mobilization of propertyless voters, a broad welfare state, substantial economic regulation and redistributive taxation?' <br />On the contrary, we need a reinforced democracy as a bulwark against tyranny, for the expression of selfhood, for the cultivation of civic skills and norms and to keep markets in place and to limit their sometimes destructive mechanism. <br /> <br />This is a very important political book written by a superb free and unbiased free mind. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the political pendulum is actually close to the far right: after giving mighty tax breaks for the wealthy, the actual US government declares that pensions and medical aid have to be cut for budget reasons! <br /> <br />I also recommend Peter Temin's work 'Did monetary forces cause the Great Depression?' where he destroys Friedman's explanation of the most important economic disaster in the US history. <br />	2005-07-13

Another important character is the knight Gawan.<br /><br />The epic is written in forceful, violent and colourful sentences, sometimes worth the surrealistic demoniac paintings of Hieronymus Bosch. It paints the not always heroic or galant deads of the chivalry of the Middle Ages with ordinary brawls, tournaments and other (love) contests. The highlight is the masterful and vivid description of the nearly unsurmountable difficulties for the capture of 'Chastel Merveile' (the Marvellous Castle).<br /><br />This epic is also not what Nietzsche said about Wagner's opera 'Rome without the text', for the author states that 'today very few people want to change earthly wealth for heavenly glory.

She survives as a kept woman by three lovers and ends in poverty, rejected and lonely. <br /> <br />She characterizes her work in Hollywood's film factory as slavery and throws a shrill light on Hollywood's morals (the casting couch) and cynicism: the end of the silent period served as an excuse to terminate all contracts. <br /> <br />The all important feature of her life was sex, not love: 'I have never been in love.' But, 'A person's sexual loves and hates and conflicts ... It is the only way the reader can make sense out of innumerable apparently senseless actions.' <br />She considers that 'the most fateful encounter in my life' was a sexual one with George Preston Marshall. <br />Nevertheless, she had some regrets: 'How often do we change the whole course of our lives in pursuit of a love that we will have forgotten within a few months.' <br /> <br />She never wrote her biography because 'I am unwilling to write the sexual truth that would make up my life worth reading.' <br /> <br />Barry PARIS did it for her, admirably. His book contains also a few corrections on Louise Brooks's statements in her book. <br /> <br />A moving text with admirable pictures.	2005-07-10

It uses beauty (or ugliness) to arrive ultimately at knowledge, at truth.' (as science) <br /> <br />Many natural adaptations have given rise to curious by-products, some of which have played a role in determining our aesthetic sense. <br />Although sometimes very tentative, this rich book sheds an insightful light on more or less hidden links, like <br />- the connection between the heavenly bodies and the pattern of life on earth (28 days) <br /> <br />- the importance of symmetry: living beings are symmetrical, which is rare for inanimate objects. Also, our evaluation of physical beauty focuses on symmetry. <br /> <br />- size as a key to survival, with the adage 'small is best'. 'The Almighty had an inordinate fondness of beetles.' <br /> <br />- the origin of painting: a natural outgrowth of the fallibility of human memory and the need to communicate. Also, the reason why we like savannah landscapes and not computer paintings because they seem unnatural. <br /> <br />- the Chomsky (innate patterns) / Piaget (blank slate) controversy on the origin of language <br /> <br />- the origin of literature: the craving for social cohesion and well-being met by oral history and stories in which the hearers appear in a leading role. More, 'The pen is mightier than the sword.' <br /> <br />- the origin of dance: a need for frenzied activity or heightened sensibilities in preparation for war, in celebration of fertility or birth or in mourning death. The rhythmic gyrations of primitive dance bind people together. <br /> <br />- the origin of music (the purest form of art): animal mating calls. <br />John Barrow explains clearly the relationship between music and mathematics as well as theories on mathematics (Platonism, intuitionism, inventionism, formalism) and music (absolutism and referentialism). <br /> <br />This book is an excellent exploration of a vast and very interesting human domain. Not to be missed.	2005-07-09

It all ends with a highly stimulating performance of the 'Dionysos and Ariadne' dance: 'Those who were not married swore that they would do it soon. Those who were, mounted on their horses and stormed home to enjoy their wives.' <br /> <br />The discussions don't attain far and away the philosophical heights of Plato. They centre on perfume, dance, wine and courage. The participants are also asked of which feature they are most proud. The answers vary from wealth, poverty, beauty, friendship, literature and justice. <br />Socrates explains his preference for spiritual love which never dies, whereas physical love passes away. <br /> <br />This symposium is sociologically interesting because it gives a fair impression of the daily life of Greek citizens. <br /> <br />Not a masterpiece.	2005-07-08

I reread part of this book and I must confess that I still didn't understand it completely.    I agree with some of the author's ideas, like his rejection of strong Artificial Intelligence and of the strong anthropic argument that consciousness was inevitable by virtue of the fact that sentient beings have to be around in order to observe the world. Here I go with Schopenhauer who said that consciousness did not emerge to think, but as a competitive advantage in the struggle for survival.    There is one point on which I completely disagree: the Platonic world of mathematics.  I am not a professional mathematician (I didn't go further than some books in Schaum's Outline Series).  However, I believe that numbers don't exist in reality. One, the 'Oneness' doesn't exist in the real world, only 'one something', e. g. 'one cow'. 'One + one = two' doesn't exist, only 'one cow + one horse = two animals'. Mathematics are only characteristics of physical processes.   J.von Neumann and H.H. Goldstine state that 'a mathematical formulation necessarily represents only a (more or less explicit) theory of some phase (or aspect) of reality, and not reality itself.' (Quoted in K.R. Popper - The Open Universe)    More, Lee Smolin explains eminently in his book 'Three Roads to Quantum Gravity' that everything in the universe is discrete, even time. Would that mean that real numbers don't exist in reality and that they break down after a certain lenght? Yes. In conjunction with the Planck lenght? Perhaps.  Professor Penrose poses the question himself: 'The system of real numbers has the property that between any two of them, no matter how close, there lies a third. It is not all clear that physical distances or times can realistically be said to have this property.'    This is a thought-provoking book.    I should recommend some books concerning problems that have been treated in this book. On the body\mind problem (V. Ramachandran: Phantoms in the brain), on determinism and free will(J. Boslough: Steven Hawking's Universe), on consciousness as a matter of matter (G. Edelman: Bright Air, Brilliant Fire), on decoherence (B. Greene: The Fabric of the Cosmos) and on the shaping of biological and social patterns through natural selection (C. Lumsden & E.O. Wilson: Genes, Mind and Culture).	2005-07-08

In the US and Great-Britain top officers of large corporations formed in the 1970s a semi-autonomous network which Michael Useem calls the 'Inner Circle'. It is a sort of institutionalized capitalism with a classwide alongside a corporate logic and permits a centralized mobilization of corporate resources. <br /> <br />This select group of business leaders assume a leading role in the support of political candidates, in consultations with the highest levels of the national administrations, in public defense of the free enterprise system and in the governance of foundations and universities. <br />One of its main goals is the promotion of a better political climate for big business through philanthropy (image building via generous support of cultural programs), issue (not product) advertising and political financing. <br /> <br />The reasons behind the constitution of this 'Inner Circle' were the declining power of the individual companies and declining profitability together with, more specifically in GB, the threat of labor socialism (nationalizations and worker participation in corporate governance) and in the US, government intervention. <br />A main issue was also the desire to control the power of the media, which in the US were considered far too liberal. <br /> <br />The interventions of this 'Inner Circle' were (and are) extremely successful. President R. Reagan and Prime Minister M. Thatcher were partly products of business mobilizations. They lowered taxation, reduced government (except military) spending, lifted controls on business and installed cutbacks on unemployment benefits and welfare. <br />On the media front, the influence of corporate America is highly enhanced, directly through media mergers, and indirectly through the high corporate advertising budgets. <br /> <br />This is an eminent study based on excellent research. <br />Highly recommended. <br />	2005-07-08

Trotzky remarks (quoted in this book): 'In a country where the sole employer is the state, opposition means death by slow starvation. The old principle - who does not work shall not eat - has been replaced by a new one - who does not obey shall not eat.'<br /><br />A centrally planned economy creates a totalitarian system where the end justifies the means, which in other words means a denial of all morals. Moreover, the individual is not respected as a man but becomes a cog in an enormous bureaucracy, where tolerance is not tolerated.<br /><br />For real liberals (like B. Russell) power has been the archevil; to the strict collectivist it is a goal in itself.<br /><br />Hayek is by any means not a pure liberal, because he insists that every state should provide a system of social insurance wth a minimum income for all.<br /><br />Hayek's warnings have been gravely vindicated by the gruelng inhumanity of the totalitarian regimes, created after World War II.<br /><br />This is a great book about liberty and independence, truth and intellectual honesty, peace and democracy and respect for the individual qua man.<br /><br />A must read.	2005-07-06

The author herself lost nearly all her family. <br />The slogan was 'be deaf and dump if you want to survive'. <br /> <br />Exceptionally, this book also relates the disturbing facts which happened in a Red Khmer camp in Thailand until one year after Pol Pot's defeat by the Vietnamese. <br /> <br />Molyda Szymusiak tells only the facts. She doesn't explain the overall picture of Pol Pot's regime, politically, socially, economically or internationally. <br />Therefore I highly recommend the eminent works of David Chandler as well as Philip Short's magisterial biography of Pol Pot (Saloth Sar). <br /> <br />This book shows painfully the disastrous consequences of a power grasp by ideological fanatics who created a one party state bureaucracy which wielded total uncontrolled power over the population. <br />This regime was a terrible shame for the left. <br /> <br />A very disturbing read.	2005-07-05

He is condemned and burnt at the stake. <br /> <br />The author depicts masterly 'the superstition, fanaticism and professional self-interest of the ecclesiastics in the affair. 'Their goal was 'to justify the future use of inquisitional methods in every case where hysterical nuns could be induced by their confessors to accuse the enemies of the regime.' <br />The hysterism was faked. Physisians found no evidence of possession by devils, only sometimes 'furor uterinus'. <br /> <br />The grueling but deeply moving execution of the priest as well as the crowd delirium during and after it with fighting for relics, is a brutal but formidable evocation worth the magical paintings of a Hieronymus Bosch. <br /> <br />Huxley gives also a deadly blow to the nostalgics and sentimentalists of medieval village life. That life 'was an enormous horror ... a society that periodically lynches its witches proclaims its faith in magic and fear for the devil.' <br /> <br />He draws also a perfect comparison between the methods of Richelieu's totalitarian dictatorship and more modern political regimes and show trials for 'all the evils of religion can flourish without any belief in the supernatural; convinced materialists are ready to worship their own Absolute, and self-styled humanists will present their adversaries with all the zeal of the Inquisition.' <br />His ironic style becomes sometimes very cynical: 'For the totalitarians of our more enlightened century there is no soul and no Creator; there is merely a lump of physiological raw material moulded by conditional reflexes and social pressures into what is still called a human being. This product exists for Society and must conform to the Collective Will which is merely by the dictator's will to power.' <br /> <br />This is a formidable historical and very topical recreation of a most exemplary medieval trial. <br /> <br />I also recommand highly Ken Russell's movie 'The Devils', as well as the works of Jean Delumeau on the Middle Ages and William Manchester's masterly 'A World only lit by Fire'.	2005-07-04

The scholar's research reveals a not so quite divine portrait of the late king. It is heavily stained by incest, sodomy, treachery, lechery, manslaughter, bloodbaths and opportunism. In one word, it exposes a satanic character.  King David followed the advice of his counsellor: 'In order to reign you should have but one goal: power, and love only one person: yourself.'  The scholar discovers also some very compromising facts about the present king.    He recognizes all too well that he lives in a split world: 'I do not say what I know; I say what I don't think; I think what I don't say; I want to say what I should not think. I am a dog turning around and around trying to catch a flea on my tail.' 'Truth is the daughter of ill fate.'    His report becomes a tohuwabohu: a rewrite of a rewrite ... until he looses his job.  The king's command of a true biography turns into an order for censure. There should be a yawning abyss between reality and what his subjects should believe: 'Do as I say, not as I do.'    This novel was (and is) an extremely intelligent attack on the 'newspeak' of one party-communist regimes, which wield(ed) complete control of the communications sector.  But the problems it tackled are even more actual and widespread today. Our world is dominated by big media monopolies, which are controlled by the powerful, who in turn control the government. These powerful people are not interested in the truth, only in 'their' truth.  Sabotage or direct liquidation of free objective journalism is rampant all over our planet.    This novel is an extremely clever and magisterial exposure of the all important 'the media and the powerful'-issue.  A must read.	2005-07-03

The main character, Cipriano Algor, a potter, looses his job because he doesn't understand the laws of the market system.  As an individual, he is confronted with a giant supermarket, which controls the marketplace by centralizing demand.  This supermarket is a part of 'The Cave', a huge inhuman closed labyrinth of apartment blocks, which is under constant supervision.    The portrait of this 'Brave New World' seems to me a caricature, with an author overshooting his marks.  'The Cave' with its apparatchiks resembles more a State with a centralized planned economy and 'Big Brother' spying than a rigged market economy.  More, the potter looses his customers because people don't want to buy his products anymore.  The rise of big housing labyrinths has demographic not free market causes.  But more importantly, people should have the right to choose democratically what kind of system they prefer. Without elections a regime will continue to exist per omnia saecula saeculorum.    This novel has not the same expressive strength as 'Blindness'.  It is sometimes hard to read and boring with pages and pages on pottery problems. It is not without some sentimentality (glittering tears) and controversial symbolism ( a dog as the representative of pure nature!)	2005-07-02

The mental hospital where the blind are imprisoned is his portrait of that system running wild. It is synonym of uncontrolled fierce competition for food and women, the law of the strongest, famine and rape.  The author shows his visceral disgust with that system by depicting packs of filth and diarrhoeal excrements where the inmates have to live in.    For Saramago 'Man is only a very simple animal'. As in 'The Cave', a dog (really!) stands out as the symbol of pure nature. Man is fundamentally pure, for 'egoism is only his second skin'. It is the system which corrupts his good nature and makes him blind for his real interests.  The wife of the doctor doesn't become blind because she helps altruistically other people and, e.g., doesn't kill the gangsters who terrorize her comrades.  She and her group don't listen to the cheerleaders of the market system. They are ultimately saved from blindness. All other listeners will stay blind.    Saramago's vision of the real nature of mankind seems very nave. His dream of the return to the Golden Age is a pipedream, for the Golden Age (before the system) never existed.    On the other hand, what is the alternative? For Saramago, it seems to be an existing one party State with a planned economy and which he supports unconditionally. Unfortunately, that country is today in an absolute disastrous state of affairs, socially, economically and politically.    Except for some exaggerations ('to eat is to steal'), this book is in fact mostly a fierce Schopenhauerian description of the real nature of man, who created the system which Saramago so viscerally abhors.  Pure altruism has never been an option for survival and no ideology can stop the 'blind' watchmaker.    This is a thought-provoking but biased book.	2005-06-27

This book is rightly a classic. <br /> <br />Its in depth portraits of a courageous woman, who defies public morality, and of her opponent-lover the despicable Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale are timeless. <br /> <br />This book is also a frontal attack on the Pharisaism of Puritanism (and other religions?), symbolized by the Reverend, who 'clear as the mid-day sunshine on the scarlet letter, establish himself a false and sin-stained creature of the dust.' <br />The comment on his death 'After exhausting life in his efforts for mankind's spiritual good' is the same as 'Do what I say, don't do what I do'. <br /> <br />The Pharisaism sounds also clearly in the following sentence (shortened): 'Pearl, the daughter of Hester Prynne, the demon of offspring became the richest heiress of her day. Not improbably, this circumstance wrought a very material change in the public estimation and at marriageable period of life, might have mingled her wild blood with the lineage of the devoutest Puritan among them all.' <br /> <br />In sharp contrast with Puritanism, the ultimate message of the author is crystal clear: 'Be true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred.' <br /> <br />A magisterial human novel.	2005-05-20

William Domhoff's 'Who rules America?', John Scott analyzes Britain's power structure and concludes that Great Britain is ruled by 'a power bloc dominated by its capitalist class. Its core comprises about 0.1 per cent of the adult population, about 43.000 people. It has been estimated that these people held 7 per cent of total wealth in 1986, with about two fifth in the form of company shares and about one third in the form of real estate.' <br /> <br />Politically, this power bloc controls the State in order to guarantee the legal framework of property, company and commercial law, on which business activities depend and to pursue economic policies which are supportive of private profit and capital accumulation. <br /> <br />Key players in the moulding of these values are the Oxbridge colleges and the public schools from which the students are recruited for leading political and industrial / banking positions. <br /> <br />Historically, the capitalist business class achieved in the beginning of the 20th century full fusion as banking and industry fused to form finance capital. From the 1930s finance capital came increasingly to be organized around institutional and impersonal share ownership, dominated by an inner circle of finance capitalists which espoused the City point of view: short term commercialism with a commitment to free international capital flows, stable sterling exchange rates and tight monetary controls. <br /> <br />And the Labour Party governments? <br />For John Scott, the Labour Party has governed, not ruled. Even less has it altered the pattern of class political dominance. <br />More, the actual Labour Prime Minister is an offspring of the public school system. <br />Nevertheless, he remarks that the economic development and welfare policies in the 20th century have not resulted in an unambiguous maximization of the advantages accruing to the capitalist class. The latter has, in all probability, seen a relative decline in the level of its income and wealth. This retribution may well be seen as a necessary concession to other classes whose electoral and other support is necessary if the capitalist class is to maintain its general economic dominance. <br /> <br />This book is an excellent analysis of Britain's power structure.	2005-05-20

It is only a barbarous mind that sees other than flower, merely an animal mind that dreams of other than the moon.' <br /> <br />But he remains completely insensitive for real barbarous practices: <br />'I saw a child, hardly three years of age, crying pitifully on the bank, obviously abandoned by his parents. ... Alas, it seems to me that this child's undeserved suffering has been caused by something far greater and more massive - by what one might call the irresistible will of heaven.' <br />Besides abandoned children, there are also abandoned ageing mothers and drifting concubines. 'Their life was such that they had to drift along even as the white froth of waters that beat on the shore.' <br /> <br />The author's real belief is fatalism: the irresistible will of heaven and the eternal law. <br /> <br />These more or less innocent travel sketches are only for haiku aficionados.	2005-05-18

Didn't we?' <br />The fact is that a lot of money was lent to corrupt and despotic regimes (Suharto, Marcos, Abacha, Ceaucescu, Mengistu, the South-African apartheid regime ...). More, after the end of the cold war, the US asked immediate debt repayment from States which were no longer strategically important. <br /> <br />Democratic governments should not be responsible for irresponsible lending by States or International Organizations. <br />She remarks that 60-70 % of all World bank projects under Mc Namara were failures and that only 10 % were ecologically and socially sound investments. <br /> <br />For her, debt should be forgiven if it was lent to undemocratic regimes, if the investments were against the interests of the majority of the population and when those who gave the money knew for what it was disbursed. <br />Ultimately, debt forgiveness will ot only favour the poor but also the rich countries, for it should not force nations to implement unsound policies and should improve security in the world. <br /> <br />By the way, she rightly lambastes massive arms investments (4 stealth bombers represent 1 schoolyear for 155 million children) and agricultural subsidies in the US and Europe (every cow receives 2,20 $ per day, or more that 1 billion human beings on our planet). <br /> <br />This book is a must read about a crucial problem for a massive part of the world population.	2005-05-17

The reasons behind the revolts were, in the US, the Vietnam war, and in France, the fear for a general numerus clausus through rigged school exams. <br /> <br />Some of his comments on human armed hubris, war and the negation of death are to the point. On the contrary, his remarks on feminism are very superficial. <br /> <br />I liked the author's book 'Young Man Luther', but I cannot recommend this one.	2005-05-07

Books	5	1	1	N	N	Canaille oblige	Gore Vidal gives us superbly vitriolic portraits of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, as well as of the Christian Right's Armageddon: 'Why conserve anything, if Judgment Day is at hand.' <br /> <br />But he sees through the rhetoric and the hypocrisy the real America of humming electric chairs and well-packed prisons. A US controlled by an oligarchical system where men of property can do well and the others are on their own; where the New Rich made their money with defence contracts, the circulus vitiosus 'transfer money from the Treasury to the various defence contractors which in turn pay for the election of Congress and President'; where the Pentagon is a black hole for wasted money while the public educational system is deteriorating because of a lack of investment. <br /> <br />On the moral side, he remarks perspicuously that 'In order for a ruling class to rule, there must be arbitrary prohibitions. Of all prohibitions, sexual taboo is the most useful because sex involves everyone.' <br /> <br />But this book contains also some remarkable essays on world literature: Henry James ('monsters have triumphed yet again'); William Dean Howells ('a darkness sufficiently sable for even the most lost-and-found of literary generations'); Logan Pearsall Smith ('idiom before grammar'); Paul Bowles ('the strangeness and terror of waking dreams'); Tennesse Williams ('he certainly believed in sin'); Italo Calvino ('the many in the one'); Anthony Burgess ('3 obsessions: religion-art-sex'). <br /> <br />A book of a remarkable observer and analyzer. <br />We need his voice.	2005-05-06

Rumsfeld who called the 9/11 attacks 'a blessing in disguise'.<br /><br />A blessing for those who benefited mightily from those attacks: the Bush Administration, the CIA, the FBI, the Pentagon, the oil and weapons industry.<br /><br />The attacks provided a perfect justification for the massive US defense budget and the tremendously juicy margins on military contracts. They provided also a perfect alibi for the launching of a geopolitical war of conquest as the author excellently explains by his analysis of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.<br /><br />Amid a muzzled and paralyzed press, the author expresses ultimately only one request with this balanced book: a thorough investigation of what really happened. But this seems now only wishful thinking.<br /><br />This book is a must read for all those interested in world affairs.	2005-05-06

The Elector of Saxony asked his opinion on Maarten Luther. He couldn't give a clearcut answer. <br />Erasmus went a long way: 'I am against the truth if it causes dissension'. <br />But he was too honest. He grasped the fact that the compulsory selling of indulgences by the Pope was an unforgivable extortion. <br /> <br />In a good hundred pages Zweig tells the ultimate tragedy of Erasmus's life: on the one hand, his belief in civilisation and the power of reason; on the other hand, a world full of dissensions and war. <br /> <br />Stefan Zweig writes in an enthusiastic style, full of dramas and contrasts. <br /> <br />A simple but masterful psychological and historical analysis.	2005-05-02

On the macro level, it excludes demographic and nationalist tendencies; on the micro level, it doesn't take into consideration the real nature of the individual. <br />People defend their class if there is a possibility of personal gain. All proletarians want their children to become bourgeois (lawyers, doctors, engineers ...) <br /> <br />Gramsci is indeed among marxists a special case because the kernel of his theory is an illusion: a 'new man' (without genes). <br /> <br />This book is only for those interested in the TC. Its general scope is flawed. <br />	2005-04-27

But they draw the line between disagreement and sheer incomprehension. <br />Their cause is the liberal one: the government can add to the growth of GNP. <br />But frankly not in the way the actual government is doing it by 'cost overruns in defense programs' (a massive part of the federal budget), instead of investing in infrastructure, R & D and, most importantly, in education. <br /> <br />They fustigate supply-side economics (serving all wealthy taxpayers, but pulling the rug under the feet of the needy), or Milton Friedman's 'Doing Nothing'. <br />On the Negative Income Tax solution they remark: 'That may accord with our Sunday morality, but not with our workday morality.' <br /> <br />By the way, this book is a clearly explained textbook on economics (macro and micro, money-banks-gold, consuming-saving-investing, big and small businesses, GNP, income distribution, externalities, rationing ...) <br />The index is superb. <br /> <br />It ends with a severe warning: 'Having fallen behind, we will stay behind.' <br /> <br />If you should read one book about economics, this is it: a magisterial course, even for economists.	2005-04-22

Both texts are from the second millenium B.C.    'The Creation' is in fact a hymn of praise of the feats of Marduk (Son of the Sun), the Babylonian king of the gods. It contains however a 'creation of man' which shows strong religious reminiscences. Man is made of the stuff of a fallen god: 'they declared him guilty ... they cut his arteries and from this blood they created man'.  Man is made to serve the gods and his burden is to labour forever.    'The Creation' is far less impressive than 'The Epic of Gilgamesh'.  It is very 'regional', written for a local god. 'Gilgamesh' treats the general human search to be equal to the gods and attain immortality.  It is also more beautifully written with magnigicent 'bis repetita placent's and hypnotizing cadenzas.  'The Creation' is a more 'clumsy' work.    'Inanna's journey to Hell' is certainly one of the highlights of world literature.  Its mythological and human themes are timeless. Its influence goes from the Greek to 'Salome' of Oscar Wilde and Richard Strauss.  Pregnant are the moanings of the queen of Hell, Erishkigal, faking childbirth, because she is surrounded by men who 'bring to a woman's body no sweet satiety, nor fondle the happy children'.  Or, Inanna's stripping to nakedness to take the cloths of the death.  As N.K. Sandars in her excellent introduction, as well as Prof. N. Kramer in his book 'The Sumerians' indicate: Inanna goes to Hell to take the place of Ershkigal and resurrect the death (e.g. her husband Dumuzi).    This book is a must read for all those interested in the highlights of world literature.	2005-04-20

He didn't know that his wife and daughter had to sell them in order to survive during the hyperinflation period in Germany. They replaced them with white papers. <br /> <br />In 'Buchmendel', a jewish literature lover takes always the same seat in a pub. He is sent to a concentration camp. When he comes back, the owner of the pub refuses to give him his old place for racial reasons. <br />After his death a friend searches for old clients of the pub who knew him. He discovers a whole bunch of very rare books. <br /> <br />Both stories are written in dashing prose. They hypnotyze the reader by unexspected events and excel through the painting of intimate emotions and excellent characterisations. <br />But most of all, they reveal the tragic influence of 'History' on the fate of normal people who were great on their own. <br /> <br />Two pearls.	2005-04-17

But not normal labourers or soldiers, but stupid ones: 'If people are simple, they fear the law.' <br /> <br />The sovereign should govern by punishment, and wage war by rewards. The laws should be implemented with absolute impartiality and the rewards cannot be inherited. <br />The sovereign should be a wicked man for 'A country where the wicked govern the virtuous, will become strong.' <br />Shang Yang's six parasitic virtues are 'care for old age, living on others, beauty, love, ambition and virtuous conduct'. <br />Other evils are 'odes, history, rites, music, filial piety, brotherly duty, moral culture, integrity, sophistry, sincerity, faith, chastity, benevolence, righteousness, criticism of the army and being ashamed of fighting.' <br /> <br />The result should be a state ruled by an autocratic despot over a nation of stupids. <br /> <br />This brutal immoral text is totally out-of-date. <br />One cannot attain supremacy anymore with a nation of stupids or produce an atomic bomb by law. <br />Education is perhaps the greatest wealth creator in our modern world. <br /> <br />This text is only for historians.	2005-04-17

He had a constant fear of poisoning and preferred to rule in secrecy. He was an inveterate liar in order to hide unpleasant truths and a total ignoramus in economical matters. <br />But he remained the most equal amongst the equals: every party member had to expose publicly his self-criticism, except the leader himself. <br />As one of his surviving companions remarks: 'He had a very simple vision of things'. <br /> <br />Pol Pot's traits infected the whole top of the Cambodian CP. Nobody could be trusted. It became 'one party State' business as usual: a continuing power struggle with assassinations till 20 years after the Red Khmer defeat. <br /> <br />Pol got his political apprenticeship in Paris in the 1950s in the Cercle Marxiste controlled by the monolithic French CP. This indoctrination had an everlasting influence on his political decisions. One example: the complete evacuation of Phnom Penh after the communist victory was inspired by the defeat of the Paris Commune in 1870. <br /> <br />When he took power, he installed a ruthless authoritarian regime. The CP had to rule by cutting-edge violence. He created the perfect slave State where nobody could choose where to go, when to sleep, what to eat or whom to marry. <br />He tried to impose the Buddhist ideal of demolishing the individual, but not to live a monkish but a prisoner's life. The Buddhist ideals were however not fit for the top, where nepotism was rampant. <br /> <br />Economically, Pol tried to install an autarky based on agriculture. But the results were disastrous for the proletarians were completely demotivated and forced to be only concerned by naked survival. <br /> <br />Geopolitically, Cambodia became a chess piece in the hands of the superpowers. Its hereditary enemy, Vietnam, was supported by the Soviet Union and a Vietnamese victory could create a Soviet hegemony in Indochina. So, China and the US supported the Red Khmers. <br /> <br />Philip Short's conclusions are not very different from those of David Chandler (in his books on Pol Pot and the S21 death camp) for he remarks 'When we look at the Cambodian experience, we have to look into our own souls'. <br />There is however a notable exception. Short believes that Pol Pot's cruel regime had his base in pre-existing Khmer cultural models. <br />But it seems rather that an unchecked one-party system ruled by a marxist fundamentalist paranoiac created the necessary conditions for committing a genocide. <br /> <br />Philip Short's gives a frightening picture of an authoritarian leader and of a for the left catastrophic experience. <br />A must read.	2005-04-15

He never pretended to be a great author or philosopher. He was not a master of intrigues, but rather a very average person. <br />His only merit seems to be that he understood that Christophe Collomb had not discovered a new land but a new continent. <br /> <br />Stefan Zweig brushes with verve the story of an unlikely designation.	2005-04-15

A woman falls under the spell of a gambler who lost his fortune and is on the verge of committing suicide. She tries desperately to save him.    This is an impressive short novel, because of the strong emerging feelings which erupt like volcanoes and leave the main characters totally upset. The endgame and the end are stunning.

Wilkinson remarks in his excellent introduction, in the era when Sun Tzu wrote his 'Art of War', 'war had become the most serious business of the State, the key to survival or ruin.' <br /> <br />Warfare was for Sun Tzu first of all a question of psychology, before strategies and tactics came into play. <br />Psychologically, the art of warfare is the art to deceive. <br />Sun Tzu is a master in psychological warfare: sap the morale of your enemy and be cleverer (wisdom, not force alone). <br />For him 'supreme excellence is to subdue the enemy without fighting.' <br /> <br />His strategy is based on foreknowledge (spying) in order to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses (political, geographical, defensive, offensive) of your enemy. And if you are not strong enough, you should be cleverer through diplomacy. <br /> <br />His basic tactics are flexibility, gaining the initiative and not fighting a protracted war. <br /> <br />For all that, you need the best commander, not the best sovereign, for a sovereign can bring misfortune upon his army, when ignorant of military affairs and\or command problems. <br />What the sovereign should do is 'bring his people in harmony with their ruler'. <br /> <br />This text is rightly a classic. People who launch preventive wars should follow a few of Sun Tzu's recommendations. <br />On the other hand, it says a lot about mankind that one of the first literary classics doesn't have the title 'The Art of Peace'. <br /> <br />General Tao Hanzhang's comments contain some excellent examples of cold war tactics, but he also forces Sun Tzu's hands. <br />'Bring people in harmony with their ruler' becomes 'the sovereign should use political pressure or other means to bring the people in harmony with him'; and, 'the ruler has to impose his will upon the people'. <br /> <br />Sun Tzu becomes an atheist because he doesn't believe in gods, but only in real spying. <br />He is also a dialectical materialist. <br />But he overemphasizes thefunction of generals. For Tao Hanzhang, Sun Tzu's principle that 'there are occasions when the commands of the sovereign (read 'Mao') need not to be obeyed' is now obsolete. <br />His evaluation of the Hitler\Stalin pact is a serious joke.	2005-04-14

Dessau as the fabrication of one impostor. <br /> <br />Sir Ronald Syme gives us a highly entertaining characterization of the author and his work, together with a sketch of the literary, social and religious context. <br />By comparing it with the Historiae of Ammianus Marcellinus he puts the probable publication date between 392 and 395. <br />This was a period of serious religious upheaval, because emperor Theodosius forbade all public exercises of pagan cults in 391, which provoked a demolition of pagan shrines (e.g. the Serapeum in Alexandria). <br /> <br />The author was a pagan traditionalist reflecting the beliefs and prejudices of the aristocracy, but he had no special political or social beliefs. He was certainly not an aggressive anti-Christian: 'Serapis or Christ, what did it matter? Money is the only god in Egypt.' <br />He can be characterized as cynical and subversive, perhaps a decayed aristocrat. <br />He preferred to use unpretentious Latin, the spoken word of his own time. <br /> <br />The content of his work is audacious in the tradition of Juvenal. <br />For Sir Ronald Syme, it is a historical fiction about gods and bad emperors. The author chose to pass himself off as six biographers. He invented a whole school of precursors as rivals to cite, to confute, to mock and to expose. His work became a parody of imperial biographies. He became a master of historical romance. <br />As Marguerite Yourcenar said: 'the emperors here became really human.' <br />For Sir Ronald Syme, this work was considered in his time as a welcome strain of humour and irreverence against the coming grey new world of Christian dictatorship. <br /> <br />This from time to time scrappy text is indispensable for the comprehension of the Historia Augusta. <br />A basic knowledge of Latin is needed because not all excerpts are translated. <br /> <br />This book will only please Latin scholars and all those fascinated by the Historia Augusta.	2005-04-13

The war forces her to leave her lover. She accepts a job as a nurse in the Kaiser's army and meets another man who accepts her child. He gets however entangled in war smuggling. <br /> <br />Stefan Zweig has never been a great character painter in his novels. His strenghts are secret plots, unexspected U-turns, ultimate upheavals, surprising explanations, unearthing special motives, extraordinary endgames. In the words of some 'too harsh' critics: an effect chaser. <br /> <br />This novel however is a combination of rather weak characterization with more or less 'telephoned' plotting. The followed pattern is not very surprising. There is not enough 'dash'. <br /> <br />On the contrary, his anti-war and anti-nationalist message is extremely clear. <br /> <br />This unfinished novel (an extension covering the years 1920-1940 was planned) is certainly not the best work of this author, but it is still a worth-while read. <br /> <br />On the other hand, I highly recommend his masterpiece 'The World of Yesterday'.	2005-04-13

Religious opposition was still rampant. <br /> <br />His tale is based on Einstein's theory of relativity and two discoveries: one by Hubble (the red shift - Doppler effect in the whole universe) and one by Wilson and Penzias (the radio-noise remains of the Big bang). <br />He poses the still unanswered question of the critical density of the matter in the universe and concomitantly its ultimate fate: heat crunch, cold death or continued stable expansion. <br />He exposes also pregnantly the real place of our tiny world and its inhabitants in the whole cosmos with its billions of Milky Ways. <br /> <br />Of course, since its publication new discoveries (black holes ...) and new complementary propositions (string theory ...) have been made, but this book is still highly recommendable for beginners. <br /> <br />A masterpiece in its own, this book's huge success inspired many followers and gave the start for a long list of more or less popular scientific works to the benefit of all.	2005-04-11

Instead, they become 'well-oiled propaganda machines repackaging government spin into journalism'.  <br />During the second Iraq invasion some media turned war into entertainment. <br />The actual paralysis of the US media is truly astounding (see also William Karel's brilliant documentary 'The World according to Bush'). <br /> <br />On the other hand, journalists who want to bring objective reporting are physically attacked, or even coldly assassinated - the ultimate form of censorship (Carl Jensen) (see chapter 10 - Killing the Messenger). <br /> <br />Conserving democratic media for the many is a shield against the sword, a symbol of the immoral policies of successive US administrations. <br /> <br />This book contains some very painful paragraphs on H. Kissinger, P. Wolfowitz and B. O'Reilly. <br />Although is doesn't present a theoretical framework like the works of Chalmers Johnson or Noam Chomsky, it is a must read in order to understand the actual state of the Union. <br />We need Amy Goodman's voice.	2005-04-10

Wolff's study is an extremely clear statistical analysis of a for many reasons rather misty affair: wealth distribution in the US. <br /> <br />His conclusion is that 'in 1989 the top 1 % of US families owned 48 percent of total US wealth'. <br /> <br />His book confirms the ground-breaking sociological studies of William G. Domhoff. <br /> <br />As Richard C. Leone remarks in his excellent introduction: ' We Americans have always flattered ourselves that we have more of two good things than almost anyone else: democracy and opportunity. To be sure, neither is simple.' <br />For, beneath the top heavy wealthy lays the vast majority of US citizens with their burdens of debt, while a lower part hasn't even social security. <br /> <br />In order to rectify the skewed situation, the author proposed a modest wealth tax, which at the top would not have been more than 10 %. Unfortunately, US fiscal policy went the other way round: taxation on the wealthy was further reduced. <br /> <br />This short study (with many illustrative tables) is a must read for economists and laymen.	2005-03-17

The reason why he didn't, seems also unbelievable: ' I missed the true significance of my action'. (p. 179) <br />Moreover, his role in the corporatocracy seems highly inflated, for he gives not many details about the concocted deals. <br />At the end of the book, the author serves a list of practical hints, but that sounds very much like the adage 'Do what I say, don't do what I do'. <br /> <br />So, why should one read this book? Because it explains the core of a pernicious system, which D. Perkins calls 'the self-destructive march to global empire' by the US. He depicts his country as a hegemon ruled by an extremely wealthy and greedy oligarchy, whose behavior has nationally and internationally harmful consequences. <br /> <br />Nationally, 12 million families worry about their next meal. History's most powerful and wealthiest empire has outrageously high rates of suicide, drug abuse, divorce, child molestation,  rape and murder. <br /> <br />Internationally, financial organizations (World Bank ...) are used through Economic Hit Men to make other nations subservient by loans for all kind of works to be executed by US engineering and construction firms. The larger the loan, the better, for those countries become easy targets when the US needs favors (military bases, UN votes, access to oil and other resources). <br />If the ruler of those countries doesn't cooperate, jackals (intelligence services) are sent in and if even those fail, a military intervention becomes unavoidable.  <br />The author gives some examples: the most probable assassinatons of the presidents of Ecuador and Panama, and the military interventions in Panama and Iraq. <br />For the author, the corporatocracy constitutes the most blatant grab in history for the hearts, the souls, the minds and the resources of the people all over the world. One example: for less than half the amount spent for he Iraq war, one could provide clean water, adequate diets, sanitation services and basic education to every person on this planet. <br /> <br />But ultimately, why is this onslaught still progressing? <br />Like David Chandler in his terrifying book on Pol Pot's S21 death camp, David Perkins observes: 'We made it happen.' The corporatocracy is in ourselves. <br />The great evolutionist G.C. Williams said: 'natural selection, albeit stupid, is a story of arms races, slaughter and suffering. We should at least think about it.' <br />David Perkins thought about it after his uncomprehended actions. <br /> <br />A very revealing book.	2005-03-14

The list starts with Jehoiakim, king of Judah, who burns Jeremiah's prophesies which he had ordered himself! It goes over the Zapruder film (still censored) to the Telecommunications Deregulation Bill (TDB) of 1995.    It is a long list of interventions by the moral establishment, against women (e.g. birth control), nudity or Darwinism, and for the protection of its own socio-economic interests.  As the book states: 'Censorship is a tool of a powerful elite which attempts to control society through the manipulation of thought, speech and all other forms of expression.'  The TDB opened the way for mega-mediamonopolies, for which 'maximizing profits and broadcasting junk food news' stand for information of the public.    The first phrase of Fred Friendly's book 'Due to Circumstances Beyond our Control': 'What the American people don't know can kill them' is still shocking but all too real.    This book contains an excellent index and is a must read for all democrats.	2005-03-13

Books	4	0	0	N	N	Another fight for the children	This book is a very well known and all too human tale about a fight for the custody of the children after a separation. <br />The fight is more complicated here, because the two parents have different nationalities and live in two totally different cultures and living standard environments after the separation. <br /> <br />It is a story of deceit, lies, briberies and abductions. Each party and their families try to influence and ultimately grab the children, who were in fact the real victims of all the pushing and pulling. <br /> <br />Malika Kaddour explains her view on the whole nasty bout, although she plays certainly not always the role of the good one in this new version of 'The Good, the Bad and the Beautiful'. <br />Nevertheless, she had the law on her side, because the children have the Dutch nationality. <br /> <br />Part of the story reads like a thriller. <br />A worth-while read.	2005-03-04

The war was all about preventing communist regimes from taking control of oil reserves.  <br />Other examples are Iraq, Afghanistan and Unocal's oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea, Colombia and Occidental Petroleum's oil fields or Kossovo and the Balkan oil pipeline. <br /> <br />In order to control oil resources the US backes armies and governments that are heavily involved in drug trafficking. The end justifies all means.  <br />This kind of powerplay is exercised by covert means (parapolitics). Unfortunately, those policies tend to metastasize into deep politics. As the author states: 'they become an interplay of unacknowledged forces on which the original parapolitical agent no longer has control'. <br />The result is that the US and the world are inundated with drugs. One cannot find one dollar note without drug traces. <br /> <br />This book is partly a rewriting of an older book of the author 'The War Conspiracy'. <br />Although it is more confusing and lesser deep digging than his Magnum Opus 'Deep Politics', it is a disturbing and impressive report. <br />Not to be missed.	2005-03-01

She was adopted by the Moroccan king and educated as a court princess with all the luxury she could dream off.  She gives us interesting and valuable information about life at the Moroccan court and in the king's harem.  Unfortunately, her father, the second mightiest man in the country, staged a coup to kill the king, most probably to install a military dictatorship and not to put the king's son on the throne, as the author pretends in this book.  When the coup failed, her father was summarily executed and his direct family sent to prison, first in a guarded house and then in isolated cells on a diet of rotten eggs.    Malika Oufkir tells us pregnantly how she and her family could survive in this rather complete isolation: by staying in contact with each other and the outer world (through a hidden radio and more or less human guards), by doing sensible things (educating the younger children, telling stories), but most of all by dreaming of an escape.  The last part of the book reads like a thriller.    This book is a very impressive tale about human survival.	2005-02-28

He was immediately drowned in it. <br />At the end of his life, Freud's work became his obsession and his comments on that work constituted an attempt to say something about what cannot be said. <br />The members of the 'Wiener Kreis' were completely astonished to discover that Wittgenstein was in no way a positivist like themselves. <br /> <br />Ray Monk gives us also a clear picture of Wittgenstein's complex and difficult character: his egotism, extreme possessiveness of his friends, fear of becoming loveless, difficulty to communicate, irascibility, mental instability ('see the madman in yourself'), his ambivalence about sexuality (a continuous battle between shame, sex and love) and his culpability. He was continuously seeking redemption for his sins, especially his pride and vanity. <br /> <br />This monumental biography is a very deep digging and extremely clear portrait of a controversial philosopher. <br /> <br />I also recommend Derek Jarman's feature film 'Wittgenstein'.	2005-02-16

Primo Levi analyzes the different more or less successful strategies of survival: organizing (stealing, smuggling, barter) or long time planning for a privileged position.    The living conditions were terrible: bitter coldness, physically (climate) as well as mentally (one was ruthlessly left to only one's own devices).  Also the Matthew effect played in full: 'who haves, shall be given; who doesn't have, shall be taken'.  Yet, notwithstanding these soul-destroying circumstances the author didn't loose his faith in humanity, because of a few unselfish deeds by some inmates.    Primo Levi wrote this profound human document as a sinister warning, for those inhuman racist treatments could happen again.    Not to be missed.    I also recommend the works of Jorge Semprun and Imre Kertesz about the same themes.	2005-01-07

The author tries to give us a picture of life in England before World War I through the tribulations in a nobleman's marriage. The main themes are religious fanaticism, conformism, hypocrisy and the Salvation Army. The pinnacle of indecency is a nobleman who becomes a boxer. <br /> <br />This book has not the same quality as 'We'.

The real rebellion for him was to stay alive. <br />The central character here commits suicide and orders that his literary creations be burned. The liquidation is complete. <br />'Why he did it?' is the question that the narrator of this book tries to find out. <br /> <br />The novel is an accumulation of liquidations. The narrator's family was a product of wars and dictatorships. After fascism and Auschwitz, as a lector in a publishing house he gets in trouble with the collectivist bureaucracy, where 'state subsidies are a disguised form of liquidation of literature'. Finally, his publishing house goes bankrupt. <br /> <br />The overall sentiment in 'Liquidation' is one of bitterness and nausea provoked by the poison of universal impotence. <br /> <br />Although the combination theatre/novel is highly original, I found that this book was more loosely built than 'Kaddish'. <br />But it is still a very worth-while read.	2004-12-31

After Auschwitz, he became a prisoner of a communist regime. <br />For him, there is no difference between a communist or a fascist dictatorship: both are a one party system with uncontrolled power in the hands of an oligarchy. <br /> <br />In this memorable book, his target is communism and more particularly the communist dictatorship in his home country Hungary, where not even the slightest oppositionist written sentence was tolerated. <br /> <br />He seeks a rationale for the constant oppression of, and in, his home country: Hungary is possessed by a sadomasochistic and perverse soul, suffering from a father complex, which needs an oppressor for its historical misery and a scapegoat for its daily failures (anti-Semitism). <br /> <br />Alongside the Homeric insults, the prevailing mood in this book is nausea: 'the soldier became a professional killer, politicians criminals, capitalism a slaughterhouse equipped with incinerators, law a rule for dirty games, world freedom a people's prison and patriotism genocide'. <br /> <br />This book is a very forceful text of a desperate humanist.

Keynes's autobiographer explains perfectly the essential differences between collectivism and classic liberalism.  He sees the reason for the attraction of collectivism in World War I, where political and economical life was directed by the state. The war itself gave also the opportunity for collectivists to seize power.  The collectivist system in the USSR showed in the beginning at least a mixed success, certaily when compared to a West in deep trouble (the Great Depression).  But ultimately the system collapsed, because investments became unprofitable and irrational (a nail of one ton was as good as millions of nails) and also because productivity growth was discouraged.    After the collapse, a liberal shock therapy was implemented which the author explains very well, but he sweeps the human side of the change (vast unemployment and a steep drop in the living standard) under the rug.    The failure of collectivism led to the mistaken view that everything should be left to market forces. But monetarism showed also its limits with failures in the capital and labour markets.  For the author, a liberal democracy is not the ideological endpoint of history (Fukuyama's pipedream). Keynes's remedy of state intervention is far from dead.    A lot happened after the publication of the book: the Euro became a reality; the EU was enlarged (but farm subsidies not lowered); Russia became authoritarian and China an economic world player.    The author pins his hope on the pacifying potential of economic freedom and on mini-computerization with its tremendous influence on human freedom.    This book is an excellent analysis of an extremely important economic failure.  Not to be missed.	2004-12-28

On the contrary, they were deeply ideological. The rulers believed in the inevitable victory of Soviet-style socialism. <br />The author gives also an excellent analysis of the evolution of the Sino-Russian relations as well as an in depth portrait of the diplomat Andrei Gromyko. <br /> <br />Concerning home policy, the author agrees with B. Souvarine that the fall of Khrushchev was provoked by his plan to reshuffle the senior party apparatus, in other words 'the sanctum of the ruling class'. He didn't have the power to liquidate them like Stalin and was himself liquidated. <br /> <br />In Soviet daily life 'watergates' were permanent features from top to bottom. 'Bugging, taping, intimidation, bribery, lying, cover-ups were all standard measures taken by the KGB with the leadership's blessing.' <br />At the top, medical assassinations could not be excluded (Maxim Gorky, Zhdanov and others). <br /> <br />This book contains also excellent information on some important historical events like the murder of the Egyptian president Sadat or of UN secretary Dag Hammarskjold. <br /> <br />It is not a secret anymore that foreign leaders who wanted to meet Brezhnev had to formulate their questions in advance. During the meeting, Brezhnev read his answers from a paper prepared by his administration. <br />A popular joke about him is mentioned in this book: 'A Soviet citizen shouted 'Brezhnev is an idiot'. He was promptly sentenced to 15 days in jail for insulting Brezhnev, andto 15 years at hard labor for divulging a state secret.' <br /> <br />Shevchenko's book gives a magisterial look into the workings of a totalitarian state dominated by a small ruling class.

Oppenheimer, the late president of Anglo-American, the greatest producer of gold and diamonds in the world: 'People buy gold out of stupidity and diamonds out of vanity'. <br /> <br />Governments have been big sellers of gold lately for budget deficit reasons but also because they earn interest on their  currency holdings. <br />Gold depreciates every year by the amount of interest people receive on their equivalent money savings. <br />Gold's only interest is industrial. In the long run, its price will be determined by its economic utility. <br /> <br />This book contains an interesting quote by Cicero adressing the Roman senate: 'The budget should be balanced, the Theasury should be refilled, public debt should be reduced, the arrogance of officialdom should be tempered and controlled and the assistance to foreign lands should be curtailed less Rome becomes bankrupt.' <br /> <br />A partly dated book with some interesting viewpoints.	2004-12-16

Popper's Open Society is very interesting philosophically and historically, but also very topical. <br /> <br />He finds the first Open Society in Rome, quoting Mommsen 'the Roman Republic was the first liberal society in history'. <br />The Roman Republic functioned on a basis of practical law dominated by (quoting Mommsen again) 'principles of freedom, property and legality'. <br />The Republic had freedom of religion, of conscience, of language and of culture. Even slavery was regulated by law. The judicial was totally isolated from religion and morality. <br />The most important advocate of the liberal state was Cicero. <br /> <br />With the fall of the Republic, we have to wait ages before a new Open Society breaks through. The author finds now only, albeit surprising, precursors. <br />St Augustine asserts that 'individuals alone, by their choices, concur to make it possible for states to develop'. <br />John of Salisbury makes the first draft of the separation of powers and alleges that the sovereign has political responsibilities. <br />Thomas Aquinas defends liberty of conscience and Marsilio of Padua asserts that political activity must take place within the context of legality. <br /> <br />Dante Alighieri emphasizes the need for a supranational body and for a separation of the religious and political powers. <br />William of Ockham defends the need for civil authorities and asserts that the sovereigh should be a guarantee of the respect of legality. <br /> <br />Very modern is the fact that most of the authors stress the all importance of PEACE, for (quoting Dante) 'only when peace is stable and lasting can man fully realize himself'. <br />Therefore we need an international body that can impose peace (Dante, Thomas Aquinas, William of Ockham). <br /> <br />In his chapter on Aristotle the author shows clearly the fundamental differences between the Greek society and the Roman Republic. <br /> <br />This book isa very original research about the origin of democracy.

Although this sects contained only a small group of devotees, some aspects of their philosophical message were taken over by Plato and influenced indirectly Christian belief.<br /><br />Like many other religions, Orphism's basis was man's aspiration of immortality.<br />The sacred texts included dogmas and precepts. Dogmas were a belief in a god as a creator and supreme ruler of the universe, man's original sin, a belief that purity of life and observance of the rites would be rewarded by perfect divinity (immortality) eventually after a cycle of rebirths and that punishment awaited the uninitiated and impure.<br />The precepts were directed towards eradication of sin through ascetism and prohibitions (e.g. meat-eating).<br />Life was considered as a period of trial and a practise for death. It was seen as a punishment for the soul for previous sins, wherefore the soul was fettered to a body. The body was seen as a source of evil.<br />Other important characteristics were the emphasis on free will and personal responsibility as well as misogynism.<br />Each individual had a divine part and a part prone to sin. He had to make a choice between them.<br /><br />Guthrie explains clearly the crucial differences with Christianism. Orphism excluded the possibility of the resurrection of the body. It had no social ethic. It was selfish for one could save only his own soul.<br />He also shows the difference with the Eleusian Mysteries.

It was bloodshed all over the place. All Mao's faithfull fellows, even Chu En-Lai, came under attack. Jiang Qing was totally unable to control her jealousy instincts: the wive of the Chinese president Liu Shaoqi was stripped naked and insulted before a mass audience. Movie directors and producers who had refused to give her prominent roles in their movies were clubbed to death. <br /> <br />Lucien Bodard's picture of the Cultural Revolution, a disaster for China with millions of innocent victims, is particularly impressive, although some sadistic scenes are nearly unbearable. <br /> <br />As long as Mao lived, Jiang Qing didn't come under attack. After Mao's death she tried again to grab the power with the 'Gang of Four'. But it all ended as tragically as the fate of her innocent victims. <br /> <br />Lucien Bodard's book is a terrible, pregnant, Rubensian portrait of one of the most cynical female villains in history, equalling Justinian's Teodora. <br /> <br />I also recommend the author's impressive Chinese historical and erotic novel 'La Vallee des Roses' as well as his two novels about China under the war lords 'Le Consul' and 'Le Fils du Consul'.	2004-12-13

It is confusing and relates fact after fact without a global vision. Into the bargain, the triple positive conclusion doesn't reflect the main content of the book.    After a very detailed description of the urban extension of Roma, its access roads and the means of transport, one can summarize the rest of the book socially, politically, economically, financially and morally, although these viewpoints are obviously intertwined.    Socially, Rome was a city of unoccupied people: on the one hand, the two higher classes (the nobility and the clergy) and on the other hand, the well organized beggars in the city and the bandit groups (Malatesta, Piccolomini) in the rural surroundings. In between were those who were occupied, mostly in construction work.    Politically, the Popes possessed all spiritual and secular power. They waged nearly continuously wars directly or indirectly by supporting the catholic princes.    Economically, the main revenues of the high classes were property rent and (for the Pope) taxes. Wars and building of palaces were extremely costly. The papal economical interventions were disastrous. They provoked the downfall of the rural districts, first, by imposing a change from grain to meat production and secondly, by heavy taxation. The peasants went bankrupt and filled the ranks of the bandits. The ultimate result was famine. Rome became from an exporter a net grain importer.  The author states (p. 184) that the policies of urbanization and war-mongering provoked a general downfall for the whole of Italy.    Financially, it was debt all over the place, necessitating the emission of huge bonds with high interest rates. People preferred to invest in bonds rather than in industrial projects. Debt was reimbursed through heavy taxation, the selling of monopolies (soap, alum) and simony (the selling of clerical offices!).    Morally, with a few exceptions the author sweeps decently the personal behaviour of the clergy and the Popes under the rug. The immense gap between the richissime and the poor didn't bother the Christian hierarchy. On the contrary, the Church rented houses to prostitutes.    After these bleak performances by the Vatican and its acolytes, Jean Delumeau arrives at a triple positive result for urban magnificence, artistic splendour and the expansion of the Christian Faith. A rather naive conclusion.    Only for historians.	2004-12-04

It stood at the centre of Roman daily life. There were brothels all over the place. Not only in brothels, but even in the villas of the rich and famous erotic and obscene pictures were openly exposed.  <br />The major part of the Roman population were slaves and these had to be available for all kind of work, also sexual, even children. <br /> <br />Prostitutes were no marginal human beings. They were considered as a stabilization factor in society for human sexual instincts and as protectors of the Roman matronas against rape and other indecencies. <br /> <br />Prostitution was also a very important economical factor. Real estate owners (Cicero) rented houses for use as brothels. But more importantly, it filled the state coffers fabulously through taxation. Every prostitute had to pay every day the price of one client as a tax. Those tax amounts were so high that this taxation survived even the instauration of Christianity as state religion. <br /> <br />This book analyzes all aspects of prostitution: origin and age of the prostitutes, clients, prices for sex, organisation of brothels, architecture, street sex, beauty products, dress, contraceptives or medical issues (abortion, venereal diseases). <br /> <br />Judicially, Frau Stumpp states rightly that Rome was a phallocratic society. Man, if a free citizen, stood nearly as an untouchable at the top of the hierarchy. <br /> <br />This is a remarkable study with an excellent biography and well chosen color illustrations. <br />It seems that this book is not easily available. Its references are 'Akademie Verlag, Berlin, ISBN 3-05-003459-9'. <br /> <br />For Greece I can recommend Hans Licht - Sexual Life in Ancient Greece and CatherineSalles - Les bas-fonds de l'Antiquite.	2004-12-03

It is a tool to achieve selfish results and sexual monopoly. <br /> <br />Two cooperating weak individuals are stronger than one brutal one. Therefore, human beings have social instincts and are equipped with predispositions to learn how to cooperate, to discriminate the thrustworthy, to exchange goods and information and to divide labor. <br />But this cooperation is selective. Human societies fragment into competing groups causing societies to be torn by genocidal feuds, wars, violence, theft, dissensions and inequality. <br /> <br />The solution Matt Ridley proposes for this innate confrontation is far from convincing and narrow minded: 'if we are to build back into society the virtues that made it work for us, it is vital that we reduce the power and scope of the state, (we need) a massive disassembling of the public bureaucracy.' (p. 264). The end of the book is a diatribe against bureaucratization and for privatization. <br />But privatization favours inequality (the haves over the have-nots) and influences individual connections only within a single state or unity. It doesn't promote exchanges between equals. Or, should the UN, GATT, NATO or the Ministries of Defense be privatized?  <br />The competition between states and/or other authorities (religious, ethnic) is as heavy and deadly as the one between individuals. States intervene in the world to install their hegemony, to protect their markets and basic resources. Within that state, groups (try to) influence the decisions of state authorities to defend their special interests. <br />What we need are strong international authorities (not private ones) which can turn virtues into rules. But if an individual state feels strong enough to sweep those rules from the table and to impose hisinterests above those of others, it will do it. <br /> <br />This book is a very mixed bag, but thought-provoking.  <br />Not to be missed.	2004-12-01

Trotsky's theories and decisions were intimately mingled with all national and international political options.<br /><br />The author reminds us of the important free elections in Russia in 1919 where the bolsheviks got only 16 % of the votes. However, Lenin swept the results of the table in order to keep the bolshevik party (and himself) in power. From that moment on democracy in Russia was dead.<br /><br />Trotsky as head of the Red Army provided the ultimate proof of this state of affairs. When in Cronstadt the mariners went on strike for free elections of the soviets, he crushed them to death.<br /><br />To the amazement of most communist leaders the bolshevik party turned into a monstrous (the words of Lenin himself) bureaucratic organization with a secretary general becoming its untouchable leader. Those leaders made the fatal mistake not to understand that power is an end, not a means.<br /><br />Stalin consolidated his power and the bureaucracy by installing his apparatchiks all over the country. He promulgated his theory of communism in one country. Trotsky called him 'the gravedigger of the revolution'.<br /><br />Stalin forced Trotsky out of the party, then out of the country and ultimately sent a secret agent to Mexico to crush him with a sledgehammer.<br /><br />Victor Serge provides also valuable information about the industrial production in the USSR, the deadly agricultural collectivisation, the Shanghai disaster or Western policies against the USSR.<br /><br />His book is an excellent, but rather partial evaluation of Trotsky's important role in the creation of, and the opposition to, a regime that influenced forcefully world politics for nearly a century.	2004-11-30

For those classes life was a horrendous daily struggle for survival. <br /> <br />C. Salles's analysis of Ancient Greece is broadly based on Demosthenes's oration 'Against Neaera', where the orator exposes the itinerary of Neaera from an abandoned child over a slave girl to the wife of a Greek citizen. <br />The slave market was fabulously huge. The author quotes Strabo saying that at the Delos market 10000 slaves changed hands every day. <br /> <br />An anagram for ROMA is AMOR. The situation of the lower classes was not better. Even for the upper-class life was dangerous: emperor Caligula forced the wives of the Roman senators into prostitution. <br />For the huge majority of the population it was again a daily struggle for life. At a certain moment people were so desperate that they asked for the dead bodies of gladiators to be sold for consumption. <br /> <br />C. Salles shows us pregnantly that the affluence and pleasures of a tiny minority in Antiquity was built on the back of a multiple of slaves and exploited people. <br />The ideals of Ancient humanism were denied to the major part of humanity, which was left in a situation of absolute despair. <br /> <br />This book is a hallucinating portrait of an idealized world.  <br />A must read. <br /> <br />I also recommend the works of Sarah Pomeroy and Bettina Eva Stumpp for their analysis of Ancient life.	2004-11-27

To name a few: causality, determinism, free will, freedom, the existence of the self, the body-mind problem, the subject-object relationship, the problem of induction, tolerance, the problem of the just war or the basics of human nature ('the would-be knower is a biological organism struggling for survival'). <br /> <br />This book is written in very clear, straightforward and very comprehensive prose, rather exceptional for this kind of work. <br />It gives a magisterial summary of the basic ideas of every philosopher. Into the bargain, it can be consulted easily for every chapter can be read independently. <br /> <br />I have only a few remarks. First, I miss one great philosopher of the 20th century: Karl Popper. I suppose that he was left out because he was still living when the book was published. On the other hand, Bryan Magee filled the gap by writing a separate book on Popper, which I recommend to everyone. <br />Secondly, I don't share his enthusiasm for the 'second' Wittgenstein and the latter's disastrous sliding into the morass of linguistics with his language games. <br /> <br />All in all, this book is a magisterial summary of 2500 years of Western philosophy.

More, they should be professional revolutionaries in the leninist sense and battle for the creation of a Russian like soviet state, which he supports unconditionally. <br />In his ukase style, he proclaims that independent philosophy should be beaten to death (p. 44). <br /> <br />This text is terribly dated. Nearly all the children of the proletarians of the 20th century became bourgeois. Into the bargain, the philosphers he attacks (Brunschvicg, Parodi, Gabriel Marcel, Fauconnet ...) are totally forgotten. Only E. Durkheim as the inventor of sociology and Bergson as the inspirator of Popper's 'open and closed societies' present some interest today. <br /> <br />The only claim that still stands is his appeal to the philosophers that they should treat real problems (unemployment, colonialism, war ...). <br /> <br />This book comes over as mere propaganda for a totalitarian state without free (independent) speech. <br />It is only of historical interest.	2004-11-24

Dennett's proposition that consciousness has something to do with language. On the contrary, it erupted before (not with) the dawning of language. <br />He admits the Schopenhauerian (and Darwinian) point of view that consciousness came into being and developed rapidly only as a means of survival because the living beings who got it, had a better chance to live longer and procreate more. <br /> <br />But more fundamentally, for him the key to the biology of consciousness is the homeostatic regulation and its fundamental values: reward or punishment, pleasure or pain, attraction or rejection, personal pros or cons and ultimately good (in the sense of 'life') or harm (in the sense of 'death'). <br />This profound observation has deep moral implications, because it assumes a biological foundation of good (peace) and harm (war). <br />The author himself doesn't develop the human aspects of his statement, but we should at least think about those, as the great evolutionist George C. Williams said. <br /> <br />This is a thought-provoking book, although the presentation was for me more or less confusing and sometimes too detailed. <br /> <br />I should also recommend G. Edelman's 'A universe of consciousness' and V. Ramachandran's 'Phantoms in the brain'.	2004-11-23

Manchester or R. Tawney) for all historians, because it shows magnificently how to turn historical events into a fascinating read.	2004-11-17

The aged have death and the young have love, and death comes once, and love comes over and over again.' <br /> <br />Kawabata's writing is subtle (the old man is tempted to breach the house rules) and intimistic (the descriptions of the ethereal bodies of the sleeping virgins). <br />But, as the great Japanese writer Yukio Mishima expresses it perfectly in his introduction, this book is a pregnant reflection on 'the terror of lust by the approach of death.' <br />A masterpiece.	2004-11-09

The vanquished had to be annihilated or enslaved: 'Apes trample to death all those who don't belong to their community'. <br />Until the end Hitler believed in an alliance change (that Great Britain and the US would turn with him against the bolsheviks). <br />When he saw that the war was lost, he ordered the annihilation of the whole of Germany and its population. <br />Even on the ruins of the Third Reich his lieutenants continued to fight for his succession. <br /> <br />This is a short but impressive tale about the madness of power. <br />Not to be missed.	2004-11-09

Police, politicians, the mayor could all be bought with the proceeds of prostitution, bootlegging and gambling. <br />The entire political system with its patronage and rigged elections became the ultimate racket. More, the whole country could be considered as a series of overlapping rackets: a national criminal network functioning as a shadow government with huge financial resources and vast political influence. <br />In this jungle only the gun spoke with absolute authority. <br />Capone bought and bullied his way to power with bullets, booze, broads and bucks. He thrived on the hypocrisy of Prohibition ('I give the public what the public wants. You can't cure a thirst by law.') <br />But Capone's power had its price: a life as an outcast and a constant fear of death, engulfed in women, cocaine and food.('I'm sick of being trailed around by a bunch of hyenas watching a chance to kill me.') <br />Ultimately he got caught and spent the rest of his life in prison, crippled by neuro-syphilis, helpless, miserable and lonely. <br /> <br />Laurence Bergreen's book is a masterful portrait of 'La mala vita' and a deeply dismaying era ('120.000 meals are served by Capone free soup kitchen'). <br />He torpedoes the myth of Eliot Ness. <br /> <br />I don't agree with another reader that a big part of this book is spent on a portrait of Al Capone's elderly brother. Counting rapidly, it covers about 3% of the whole story and is cleverly used as a contrast. <br /> <br />A book that reads as a thriller. Not to be missed.	2004-11-06

Books	5	9	12	N	N	Friedman countered	Peter Temin's answer to the title of his book is NO. <br />He explains clearly the two main hypotheses concerning the Great Depression. <br />First, the money hypothesis (Friedman & Schwartz), which states that the collapse of the banking system was the primary cause. The fall in consumption and investment were a result of the Depression. <br />Secondly, the spending hypothesis, which states that a fall in consumer spending was the prime cause. The banking crisis was a result of the Depression. <br />The author shows clearly that the banking panic was also caused by high-level fraud. <br />The spending collapse was caused by a fall in income (wages), to a lesser extent by a decline in wealth (the stock market crash) and a fall in consumer sentiment (bad expectations). It influenced negatively the residential construction market and via the textile industry, agriculture (a steep fall in cotton prices). The ultimate result was huge unemployment. <br />The Depression was also aggravated by international events. A steep depression in Europe caused a fall in exports. <br />The Federal reserve did nothing to stem the decline by e.g. an expansionary fiscal policy. On the contrary, it chose to raise interest rates in order to preserve the international value of the dollar during the European currency crisis. <br /> <br />Peter Temin's book is an important and extremely balanced econometric study. It could be rather difficult for the layman, although the author thinks otherwise.	2004-10-25

His exposure of FBI practices of secretly policing authors and their writings shows how intelligence services (and the establishment which controls them) are obsessed with free speech (free trade in ideas).  Writers, playwrights and artists figure here only as examples for those practices. There were surely other victims.    Sometimes, the author's emotions are comprehensively running high with expressions as 'an alien police state' or 'a ... sinister ... level of humiliating absurdities'. But he discovers that even librarians were asked to keep an eye on borrowers and that words like 'culture' or 'freedom' seemed to raise a red flag in the FBI. Nobel Prize winners ought to be watched by Big Brother. Some authors were even hounded to their grave.    The whole book exposes the FBI as a secret government engaged in criminal behaviour composed by an interlocking network of official spies, mercenaries, opportunists and profiteurs.  What is even more astonishing is the fact that in most cases the informants hadn't even read the works of the authors on whom they were spying!    Herbert Mitgang stresses rightly that government files are constitutionally dangerous to the US values of individual independence (the right to be let alone).  Robert Sherwood's quote summarizes perfectly the dilemma:'If our national security is to be rated above the security, the civil liberties, the dignity of every individual American, then our national security is not worth defending'.   This is a most necessary book for the defense of individual freedom.	2004-10-25

Von Sternberg will always be remembered for one of the most impressive movies of all times 'Der blaue Engel', but his career covers the sound and silent movie period.    It is a very revealing book, not about his personal life, but about his professional viewpoints and struggles.    His actor's direction was based on a penetrating insight into the real human nature. First, he considered that 'the guinea pig of the artist is his own self' and secondly, that 'the average human being lives behind an impenetrable veil and will disclose his deep emotions only in a crisis which robs him of control'.  His professional life was an enduring fight with   (1) the film studios and its producers. He knew their blatant commercialism: 'If a snail were to offer a contribution of value to Hollywood, it would be located instantly'.   (2) his actors (an E. Jannings or a C. Laughton behaved like bad children on the set. A notable exception was his miraculous actress Marlene Dietrich.)  (3) his rivals within the director's guild.  and ultimately when the movie was produced (4) the moral establishment and its servile movie critics.    Von Sternberg understood the profound impact of the film medium, which revealed 'the real world where wealth and poverty live side by side, and where cruelty and indifference can no longer be ignored.' The medium has an amoral basis: 'the strongest appeal to the masses was the simplest one: the formula always revolves around sex and its biological associate, violence. ... One bond that links all audiences is the animal in man.'    He also gives us a penetrating portrait of some of the greatest masters of cinema: D.W. Griffith ('remove these 10000 horses a trifle to the right'), C. Chaplin ('the comic side of humiliation') or E. von Stroheim ('the intensity of his actor's direction').    His ultimate goal was to create 'art', for 'it is easier to kill than to create.'  The overall picture shows us von Sternberg as a noble, passionate, honest, craftful and extremely intelligent movie director.  This autobiography is part thriller, part melo, part drama, part psychoanalysis.  It is an essential read, not only for the film historian.	2004-10-22

Holloway tells us outstandingly and very detailed the gripping story of the development of nuclear weapons in the Soviet Union. He shows us that the SU success was the result of the effort of Russian scientists with I.V. Kurchatov in a crucial role, although some data were obtained via spying (Klaus Fuchs). <br />The nuclear weapons building combined the best (scientists, engineers) and the worst of the SU, with prisoners working in appalling conditions (no protection) and real nuclear exercises with soldiers as guinea pigs. <br /> <br />D. Holloway analyzes also pregnantly the hostile ideological environment for scientists. The regime's fundamental logic remained political. The politicians had the right to define what was science and pseudoscience. In the name of dialectical materialism whole scientific disciplines (e.g. genetics) were destroyed (the Lyssenko case). <br />Physics also came under attack. Beria asked Kurchatov if it was true that quantum mechanics and relativity theory were idealist, antimaterialist. Kurchatov replied that if relativity theory and qm were rejected, the bomb would be rejected too. Stalin's ultimate answer was:' Leave them in peace, we can shoot them later!' (p. 204) <br />This 'pseudoscientific' debate was held within a bureaucratic framework. Scientists were well paid and the party bureaucrats and ideologues were jealous and wanted to take their place, even if they were incompetent. Beria left physics unhampered because he needed the bomb. In that sense, physics remained a small element of civil society in a totalitarian state. But if the scientists had failed, they would certainly have received a neckshot. <br /> <br />The impact of nuclear weapons on international political relations is also outstandingly explained. <br />After WW II the Soviet leaders assumed rightly that the US was seeking world dominance and that the SU was the main impediment. The scientific planners in the US discussed seriously a preemptive (!) strike against the US. <br />Stalin was not impressed by the US nuclear power. He continued tot think that conventional weapons and troops had still the upper hand. As an example, he took the risk of the Berlin crisis in 1948. But he grasped that the SU also needed the bomb. <br />The physicists knew that an international balance of power was needed. They understood the effects of a nuclear war and explained to the politicians that the survival of the human race was at stake. <br />After Stalin, Khrushev renounced Lenin's thesis that war was inevitable between capitalist states. As the nuclear stockpile grew, he admitted that a peaceful coexistence of capitalism and socialism was preferable. <br /> <br />D. Holloway wrote a magisterial analysis of an essential part of mankind's history. A fascinating read.	2004-09-09

Magee - Confessions of a philosopher). On the other hand, the importance of Peano's work, his clashes with Wittgenstein (who torpedoed a big part of Russell's work) and D.H. Lawrence (for Russell, a fascist) as well as his questioning of G. Frege (whose work was annihilated by one question by Russell) are very well documented. <br />Politically, Russell became a utopian socialist (no private property, which was the source of all evil) and later a real liberal fighting for universal suffrage also for women. <br />A key event in his life was the outbreak of WWI. It shattered definitively his trust in mankind. He became a sceptic and a convinced pacifist for the rest of his life. <br /> <br />Although I found that there were too many love letter excerpts in this book, it remains a fascinating read.	2004-09-07

Keynes is a tale about the fall of the British Empire with Keynes as one of its most clairvoyant and active go-betweens trying to avoid the disaster. Great-Britain had won the war but it was bankrupt crushed by its debt contracted to buy US weapons.  This book shows clearly through its analysis of the Bretton-Woods negotiations and the discussions about the conversion of the British debt, that the ultimate goal of the US Administration was to get Britain on its knees and to take its place as world leader.  The US prefered an alliance with the Soviet Union against Britain. Their most important negotiator H.D. White was a convinced Soviet spy.  Keynes defended exhaustingly Britain's role in world matters by begging time for a reconversion of the British industry from a war to a civilian economy and for safeguarding its Commomwealth with its preferential tariff and pound sterling payment system.  The humiliating conditions for its debt conversion imposed by the US would cripple the British economy for years.  The suicidal internecine European wars created a new world hegemon: the US.    Before the war, Keynes defended his 'Treatise' policies, but saw them applied in Germany by a very clever economist, Hjalmar Schacht, who also saved the German economy internationally by creating a bilateral trade system.  Prof. Skidelsky shows us also pregnantly the deterioration of Keynes's physical condition, aggravated by his exhausting travels, difficult (empty handed) negotiations and even hard opposition at home when he was in the US.

She doesn't even mention the real reason behind the CR, namely the fact that Mao lost the majority in the Central Committee and unleashed the youth in order to regain his power, causing millions of deaths (see Simon Leys: The new Clothes of Chairman Mao.)  The only comment on the CR in this book reads as follows:'Jiang Ching's unfulfilled desire ... that made ancient tragedies stir the souls and foster civilizations. And it was that very same desire that sparkled the flame of the Great Cultural Revolution.'(p.250)  This comment is also an extremely flattery (an euphemism) portrait of Mrs. Mao ('She was a heroine.' p. 243), while it was not a secret that she took control of the Cultural Ministry to take revenge (by tortures and assassinations) on all people (e.g. movie directors) who had refused to give her major roles in their movies.  As a member of the Gang of Four she tried to take Mao's place after his death. For a formidable portrait of Mrs. Mao I recommend Lucien Bodard's masterpiece 'Le Chien de Mao'.    The work camp scenes, the erotic encounters and the mass rally to insult a forged 'class enemy' are more convincing. They show us that each member of the Red Guard had to loose its individuality and privacy (no sex, no secrecy, no free speech, mass confessions) and had to be a 'cog in a big revolutionary machine'. It was a jail life under the iron fist of the proletarian revolution with the slogan 'killing the chickens to shock the monkeys'.    But underneath the 'purity' of the revolutionaries we discover jealousies, drive for power and dominance, manipulations, fierce competition, fear and lies. The author herself is far from innocent: 'I am my ambition.' (p. 245)  Overall, the atmosphere in this book is rather sentimental and not without a certain narcissism. Also, the sudden change in the character of one of the main players seems extraordinary.    This is certainly, and by far, not the best book on the Cultural Revolution or on the work camps.  Therefore I can recommend two masterpieces: Nieng Cheng's 'Life and Death in Shanghai' ( a moving and inhumanly biting biography of an innocent woman caught in a political quagmire) and Xianliang Zhang's 'Half Man is Woman' (a formidable tale about work camp inmates and an in depth analysis of the gender battle).	2004-09-04

Johnson wrote a dark and very revealing book. <br />He shows forcefully that the US became a militarist empire, which eroded the democratic underpinnings of the constitutional empire and transfered power tot the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies. His thesis is profusely illustrated: US military and intelligence interventions worldwide, the enormous defense budget and hundreds of US bases all over the planet. <br />This imperialistic behaviour has also an economic veil (neo-liberalism), which the author castigates as 'rich countries kicking the ladder to keep poor nations from catching up' via the WTO and the IMF. <br />But this brutal behaviour brings with it inhuman sorrows. <br />First, a state of perpetual war leading to more terrorism. For the author, the war on terrorism is only a cover-up for imperialist expansion. Further, in order to maintain its empire, the US pays off client regimes, uses state terrorism, forces 'regime changes' via coups, assassinations, economic destabilizations and invasions, with millions of civilian casualties. As an example, his analysis of the Iraq war is brilliant. Its ultimate goal is imperialistic: the creation of permanent military bases in this country in order to dominate the Middle East. <br />Secondly, a loss of democracy and constitutional rights. The 'echelon' system dwarfs George Orwell's Big Brother. After September 11, the US acts as if it is no longer bound by international laws. <br />Thirdly, information becomes disinformation, mere propaganda and glorification of war and power. Orwell's newspeak 'war is peace' became a reality with the notion of 'preventive war'. In the Iraq war, the US troops allegedly bombed deliberately the offices of international journalists (the trial is still going on) showing clearly that it is not interested in free speech (objective reporting). <br />Fourth, perhaps ultimately bankruptcy by financing an overstretched unproductive army and colossal military investments. The author quotes judiciously Robert Higgs who characterizes this military-industrial complex as 'a vast cesspool of mismanagement, waste and criminal conduct.' <br />On top of the tremendous margins on military contracts, he quotes the deputy inspector general saying 'that adjustments of 4,4 trillion dollars in the Pentagon books were needed, and that 1,1 trillion dollars were simply gone.' Mind-boggling. <br />The author also torpedoes the fable that the US caused the collapse of the Soviet Union and that it won the Cold War. <br />Ultimately the author is very pessimistic about the state of the Union and believes that the actual situation is irreversible! <br />This is a brutal but necessary book. A must read for all those interested in the future of mankind.	2004-08-28

All those who didn't support the new rulers were nearly daily harassed. For Haffner, this harassment became a daily duel between the individual (himself) and the State. <br />Under the guise of fighting for the liberty of the German State, letter and phone secrecy were abolished as well as freedom of speech. People were submitted to unrestricted search warrants, property seizure and arbitrary detention. <br />This book gives also a succinct but excellent summary of the German political situation after World War I until 1933 with the cowardly betrayal of their voters by the leaders of the opposition parties as a culmination point. <br />This book is an in depth personal account of the catastrophic change in Germany in 1933, which forced the majority of the German population (the Nazis didn't obtain the majority in the election) to live in a fascist State. <br />Not to be missed.	2004-08-06

Chomsky analyzes the US foreign policy of the last hundred years and his conclusion is straightforward: hegemony is more important than survival for the US.  <br />The most blatant example is the Cuba crisis of 1963, when the US prefered hegemony over the risk of a nuclear catastrophe. A Russian soldier named Arkhipov had to save the whole planet. <br />Other examples are speaking for themselves: unlawful (World Court) interventions in Nicaragua, in other Latin American countries and Indonesia (out of fear of independence and excessive democracy), the US-Israel-Turkey-India alliance against Confucianism and Islam and most recently the war in Iraq. For Chomsky, this war served to ensure control of Arab oil and subjugation of the Palestinians to Israel's will. It was also a showpiece that the US could control the world by force. <br />The author exposes and illustrates the US poltical agenda by its programs for offensive use of nuclear arms, by its military use (not control) of space and by blocking verification measures for biological and chemical weapons. <br />Hegemony assumes the right of arbitrary agression to defend vital interests as access to foreign markets, energy supplies and strategic resources without taking into account moral or legal objections. <br />Chomsky exposes the double standards and the moral hypocrisy by cleverly turning upside down the US interventions and by asking what the US would have done if other countries had copied what the US did to them. <br />Of course, this strategy is never declared officially. It is hiden behind lies, moral propaganda (war for democracy), blatant phariseism and control of opinion through media control. <br />The recent creation of independent Arab TV channels is a bitter blow for the US propaganda machine. <br />A summum of phariseism was the dossier with Saddam's crimes released by the UK foreign secretary (Jack Straw) which was drawn almost entirely from the period of US-UK support for Saddam (sic!) <br />Chomsky also analyzes in depth the US national policy with the use of terrorism as an excuse for radical right-wing policies. <br />Chomsky's arguments are irresistable. The question is now: Can the US realize its dream of global dominance? The answer is NO. The key to that answer is China. This country became in a few years a key economical and political world player and the leaders know it (see the daily Chinese Business Channel). China will judge the US foreign policy on its stance on Taiwan. Exclusion out of the Chinese market would be a catastrophe for US corporations. <br />Chomsky presents us a magisterial and fundamental analysis of the real US policies behind the rhetoric. It is a book by a splendid free mind and a model humanist.	2004-07-26

It exposed the communist countries as regimes ruled by a very small oligarchy of high level party members (sometimes by only one person, the party secretary). They were totalitarian dictatorial States. <br />One bitter joke went around that the world's history could be summarized by three 'at' stages; matriarchat, patriarchat and secretariat. <br />This small oligarchy built around itself a heavy State bureaucracy (later named the Nomenklatura), through which it controlled the whole country, politically through the one party system, economically through State monopolies and ideologically through an absolute control of the media. <br />In fact, the masses were exploited with an iron fist.The Nomenklatura disposed of all the wealth. Everybody else had a job but lived in poverty. <br />Djilas' book gives a cynical picture of the functioning of a totalitarian State with its corruption, its enormous differences in living standards and its complete resistance to change. <br />For Djilas, communist regimes were slumbering civil wars between the government and the population. The government could only keep control by using physical (knocking down insurrections, incarceration and show trials) and ideological (censure) violence. <br />Djilas also analyzes the role of Lenin and Stalin in the creation of this State bureaucracy. <br />The Hungarian Nobel Prize winner Imre Kertesz defined the difference between fascism and communism as follows: fascism was a reality, communism a utopia, but both were characterized by the ruling of one party which wielded uncontrolled and unlimited power. Both were a disaster for the population. <br />Djilas' book is the 'classic' about totalitarian bureaucracies. A must read, not only for historians.	2004-07-24

William Domhoff's magisterial analysis of the US power system. <br />He adds 'top-level managers' to the power elite, which is composed of the owners of large income-producing properties. He adds also one more question to the three ones quoted in his former book: who shines? <br />Those income-producing properties are, on the national level, big corporations, banks and agribusinesses and, locally, real estate, construction and land development companies. <br />The owners and top-level managers constitute at best 1 % of the US population and have an enormous share of all income and wealth in the US. <br />G. William Domhoff shows clinically how they defend their interests through a small cluster of people and institutions ( a social upper class, a corporate community and a policy-formation network). Individual members (the oligarchy) of the upper class and the corporate community are involved in the policy-formation network. See, as an example, the members of the president G.W. Bush government. <br />The power elite dominates the two major political parties and the federal government through a coalition of Republicans and rightist Southern Democrats. <br />Concerning the general public, G. Wiliam Domhoff remarks that it has little or no influence except in times of unpopular wars or domestic social upheavals. He sees no change in the actual situation and predicts that the corporate-conservative coalition is most likely to prevail for a long time. <br />G. William Domhoff's arguments are extremely powerful. Therefore, this book is an essential read for the comprehension of the political/economical functioning of the US power system.	2004-07-23

Who wins?  By answering these questions, he arrives at the clear-cut result that the US is ruled by an 'interacting set of families and socially adhesive cliques that possesses great wealth and makes up only 0.5 percent of the population.'  In other words, the US is ruled, nationally and locally, by an oligarchy constituted by members of this small upper class.  Nationally, we find those members in the most important corporations, banks and law firms. Locally, we find them in real estate, construction and land development companies.  This power elite created and controlls directly the best think-tanks like the Council on Foreign Relations, the Conference Board, the Hoover Institute or the American Enterprise Institute.  As also Michael Parenti clearly explains, this oligarchy influences decisively the media (TV and press) via the enormous and crucial advertising budgets of big corporations. The power elite also supports heavily the 'best' candidates in both political parties.  G. William Domhoff illustrates cleverly his viewpoints with the example of senator Prescott Bush, the grandfather of the actual president.    This book is a brilliant and masterful analysis and a must read for all those interested in the US political/economical system.	2004-07-20

But ultimately, why does she pretend that the laws of physics lie? She writes: 'Does this law (of universal gravitation) truly describe how bodies behave? Assuredly not.' (p. 57)  Why? Because there are other forces: electromagnetism and the strong and weak radioactive force.    She continues:'For bodies which are both massive and charged, the law of universal gravitation and Coulomb's law ... interact to determine the final force. But neither law by itself truly describes the final force ... These two laws are not true; worse they are not even approximately true.' (p. 57)    So what is true for her? Only the behaviour of bodies: an apple falling from a tree.  More, these crucial sentences are very confusing. The words 'final force' would better be replaced by 'result' (of the interaction). There is no 'new' physical force in play here.    But she goes even further (sic!):' I will allow that this law (of universal gravity) is a true law, or at least one that is held true, within a given theory. But it is not a very useful law.' (p. 58)    So, one of the 4 basic laws of physics is not useful. Also when mankind is bringing a satellite into orbit with a rocket?   And the 3 other forces? I hope the author doesn't have a computer.    Furthermore, the author believes that the wave collapse in the quantum universe doesn't 'truly' occur. Nevertheless, the decoherence theory learns us that it is almost certain that there are no existing particle waves in the whole universe. The quantum experiment with one particle in an empty space isn't realistic (although very important). In the universe, all existing particles are continuously bombarded by other particles.    Don't loose your time with this one.	2004-07-19

Gould about the question if evolution is progressive. No, for Gould. Yes, for Dawkins. For the latter, progress cannot be defined in terms of complexity (Gould), but rather by the accumulation of features contributing to adaptation. I believe now that Dawkins is right.<BR>Other very important issues are his battle with the creationists, his lucid pro-opinion on genetically modified food, his brilliant refutation of genetic determinism via the blueprint/recipe  distinction or his necessary virulent anti-religious viewpoint (religion is a virus of the mind and the most inflammatory enemy-libelled device in history).<BR>I have only a few remarks.<BR>Richard Dawkins writes that 'Every time we use contraception we demonstrate that brains can thwart Darwinian designs'.<BR>But, ceteris paribus, the outcome here is a certain defeat. The genes of those who use contraception will be overrun by those who don't. Contraception is itself a component of the Darwinian design.<BR>In his essay 'What is true', he misses some important points.<BR>As Tarski said, truth = accordance with the facts or processes.<BR>Popper's importance was mainly the refutation of inductivism and its demand for infinite corroborations. As long as a theory has not been falsified we can continue to work with it. Popper's proposition constitutes a progress and time gain of lightyears for science as a whole. Also testing remains the cornerstone of scientific research.<BR>Presenting Popper as a truth-heckler seems to me a little overdone, when we don't know 90% of the matter in the universe, perhaps 1 % of the existing virusses; when 'I' doesn't exist (V. Ramachandran) or when 'is' is an illusion (L. Smolin). As Popper said, the more we know, the more we see how little we know.<BR>Richard Dawkins' essays are thought-provoking analyses and comments, written by a splendid humanist and a superb free mind.<BR>This book is a must for all those interested in the fate of mankind.	2004-07-17

In Martin Rees' more or less pessimistic outlook the next fraction of a second is crucial for the future of mankind.<BR>With worst case scenarios he warns for threats without enemies (cosmological catastrophes) as well as for man-made threats (environmental degradation, nuclear weapons, bio-terror, robotics or nanotechnology).<BR>He concedes that the technological future in our century is brilliant, where some mind-boggling artefacts like implants of computers in the human brain or the achievement of immortality should not be plainly dismissed. But there are darker sides at our scientific progress, making Huxley's 'Brave New World' a distinct possibility via designer drugs and genetic interventions.<BR>This book deals also with demography, cosmological travel and space emigration, the future growth of the human (or new) twig(s) and (for the author a key challenge) the search for alien life.<BR>Martin Rees did a tour-de-force by selecting and combining concisely vastly different fields in a small and easy understandable book. <BR>With excellent notes, this work, like all his other books, is a must read for all those interested in the fate of mankind.<BR>Carl Djerassi's autobiography 'The Pill, Pygmy Chimps and Degas' gives a lively picture of the political infightings in the organization of the here mentioned Pugwash conferences.	2004-07-16

It doesn't have the same high intensity of his political novels like the violent masterpieces 'The Pyramid', 'The Palace of Dreams' or 'The Eagle' about life, politics and the longing for freedom in a totalitarian State.<br />I also found the mixing of the blood feud part with the visit of a writer and his wife to the Albanese Rrafsh region, as well as the brief encounter of his wife with a family feud murderer, rather artificial.<BR>The story is also partly written in a 'superlative' style.<br />Not one of Kadare's masterpieces, but, as always with this masterful author, a worth-while read.	2004-07-06

Craig Copetas' book gives us a rare insight in the well curtained offices of big metal traders. His story centres on Marc Rich and his companion Pincus Green, who left in disgust their employer Philipp Brothers, at that moment a unit of Engelhard MC, because of the 'meagre' bonuses they received at the end of the year. These bonuses were in fact only a fraction of the revenues the two traders generated for the company.<BR>The new company they created attacked immediately and head-on the core businesses of their former employer.<BR>Craig Copetas shows us how Marc Rich's commodity trading business was based on 'deep' contacts (Henry Kissinger), market cornering, tax evasion, and profiting most of all by circumventing a US oil embargo against Iran.<BR>Attacked in court for unlawful trading and tax evasion Marc Rich's companies pleaded guilty to 38 counts to the tune of ninety million dollars, still a small portion of the amassed fortune. Fines of $50,000 a day were disbursed without the slightest difficulty.<BR>When he was finally condemned, Marc Rich had already settled down in Zug (Switzerland) with a Spanish identity card.<BR>He was ultimately pardoned (he risked a potential jail term of over three hundred years!) by President Bill Clinton (for generously supporting the Democratic Party?).<BR>This book is a keen look behind the curtain of a highly speculative and risky business, where the best informed traders corner the least informed ones. Options should limit the risks.<BR>For interested readers and traders alike.	2004-06-16

It can be ranked on the same level as Homer's works.<BR>It is also in some aspects a modern work. Some scenes are worth a Hieronymus Bosch or 20th century surrealism: 'She had been terrified by a nightmare in which she saw all the rooms and walls of her house streaming with blood, and fire devouring all the magic drugs ... A number of creatures whose ill-assorted limbs declared them to be neither man nor beast had gathered round her like a great flock of sheep following their shepherd from the fold.' (p. 165)<BR>Psychoanalysis is not far away when an oracle hints that a ship is a mother's womb: 'Argo carried us in her womb; we have often heard her groaning in her pain.' (p. 184)<br />On the other hand, the gods are still allmighty and condition all important events. But like in Homer's works, the divine interventions are nothing more than today's psychological explanations of normal human behaviour. The physical feats, inspired, provoked or influenced by the gods, can only be human.<BR>The highlight of the story is the love between Jason and Medea, who is clearly presented here as a witch. But Apollonius calls love poetically but realistically 'Unconscionable Love, bane and tormentor of mankind, parent of strife, fountain of tears, source of a thousand ills'. (p. 159)<BR>This book has also a historical cosmological importance: 'He sang of that past age when earth and sky and sea were knit together in a single mould' (p. 49); in other words, a foreshadowing of priest Lemaitre's original single atom.<BR>One also feels distinctly that this work is an abridged version of a former written epic. The end is far too abrupt and doesn't even relate the homecoming of Argo's crew.<br />This edition contains a good, but too long, introduction by the translator and an excellent glossary. It would have gained in quality if it had contained a map with Jason'smost probable voyage.<BR>A must, not only for fans of classical literature.	2004-06-15

Shentalinskii ploughed deeply in the KGB archives searching for official documents about the mysterious disappearance or the silencing of a whole generation of soviet writers, with B. Pasternak, M. Bulgakov, A. Akhmatova, I. Babel, B. Pilnjak, A. Platonov, O. Mandelstam and N. Hagen-Thorn as the most known.<BR>His findings are mind-boggling: about two thousand writers were arrested during the soviet regime. More than fifteen hundred of those died in prison or work camps.<BR>The CP of the USSR with its uncontrolled power 'collectivized' literature by installing a State controlled Writers Union, which created its own Gulag: those writers who were considered critical of the regime or didn't follow the official line, were literally (executed) or figuratively (publication interdiction) eliminated.<BR>Extremely painful are the forced written 'confessions' of the authors. They were promised a free leave if they avowed to be traitors, but after the confession they got a shot in the back of the neck. V. Shentalinskii even found the exact dates of the executions.<BR>As Beria said: 'Give me anybody and within 24 hours I shall force him to confess that he is a British spy.'<BR>This book contains also details on the murder of the Spanish POUM leader Andres Nin (the father of Anais) and some dreadful paragraphs on Gorki. He turns out to be the servile mouthpiece of Stalin during the Kulak liquidation, but the killing of his son was a dire warning that his position was far from safe.<BR>This depressing book is a must for all those interested in the history of the ancient USSR, and more specifically in its treatment of literature and its status within the 'communist' State.<BR>I also recommend Ismail Kadare's book on the same subject 'Le crepuscule des dieux de la steppe'.<BR>Varlam Shalamov's book 'Kolyma Tales ' tells the story of the death of A.

(p. 71)<BR>On the other hand, his Homeric hymn on business successes (p. 177-8): 'business has increased the capacity to produce wealth explosively ... Half the expansion in wealth-producing capacity was used to create leisure time by cutting the hours worked while steadily increasing pay. An additional third ... has gone into health care ... There has been almost equal growth ... in the expenditures on formal schooling...' proved to be far away from the actual reality.<BR>The working class is confronted since the nineteen seventies with decreasing real salaries. Today millions of US citizens cannot afford healthcare insurance and 60 % of the US working class don't earn a 'living' wage as determined by the Economic Policy Institute(Barbara Ehrenreich).<br />Peter Drucker stresses rightly the all importance of education for wealth creation. The Jesuits also knew its importance for other reasons: 'They designed the first modern school to make themselves masters of the high-born and the learned.' (p. 239)<BR>Nevertheless, investment in education in the US has nearly disappeared (Molly Ivins, Lou DuBose).<br />The author castigates the arms industry as counterproductive. But defence programs take now half of the US real budget (Gore Vidal).<BR>He criticizes harshly the hostile takeover as an assault on management: 'What underlies the takeover bid is the largest possible immediate gain to the shareholder ... the raider only often immediately dismantles or loots the going concern, sacrificinglong-range, wealth-producing capacity to short-term gains.' (p. 228)<BR>But the M &amp; A game continues unabatedly.<br />Nevertheless, and all in all, this book continues to be a worth-while read.	2004-06-08

A lot of well known people are mentioned in it, but I felt that most of the chapters were written more for insiders.<BR>Fortunately, this book contains some other important movie items which tell a lot about the Pharisaic mentality of the people who ran the studios.<BR>Hollywood's success story is built on its star system. A big panic broke out in the fifties of last century when one of Hollywood's superstars Ingrid Bergman left the US to marry the Italian director Roberto Rossellini. The movie bosses were shattered and thought that they would lose a big part of their public (box office). They launched a big smear campaign against the actress (adulteress...) and forced the movie critics to criticize heavily her new movies. The not so 'orthodox' behaviour of other superstars was left unblemished.<BR>The author unveils the real role of Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons as the 'Big Sisters' of Hollywood, spying on the stars and employees on behalf of the studio bosses. If the crew didn't behave as the bosses wanted they 'were called on the carpet and told - Unless you show yourself as a respectable person, you'll lose your contract'.<br />I found this book a decent work on a difficult subject.	2004-06-07

It would equally be true, and equally one-sided, to say that the religious changes were purely the result of economic movements.' (p.312)<br />As an example, the Christian Church itself had changed mightily in the Renaissance. It persecuted the Spiritual Franciscans who followed St Francis' rule of evangelical poverty. It was the richest company in the Western world (see W. Manchester: 'A world lit only by fire').<br />Tawney remarks rightly that what Calvin did for the bourgeoisie of the sixteenth century, Marx did for the proletariat of the nineteenth. Calvin's success was firmly prepared by Puritan moralists, who stressed thrift, work as an end in itself, efficiency and rational calculation. They paved the way for a shrewd commercial and powerful midldle class, which adopted the Calvinist religion and its ethic as a natural ally.<br />This very rich book shows the real impact of Calvinism on the whole society. One example: wages. Calvinism considered 'that high wages are not a blessing, but a misfortune, since they merely conduce to weekly debauches.' (p. 267)<br />This is a brilliantly written, colourful, metaphorical and yet scientific work. It should be an example for many historians, of how 'essential historical evolutions' can be presented to the public in a comprehensive and attractive language.<br />This is an essential read for the understanding of out modern society.	2004-06-07

The articles in the different editions of the Soviet Encyclopaedia on Einstein's theory of relativity, quoted in this book, are a prepostorous example of the schizophrenia in communist countries. Officially, Einstein's theory was painted as an antiscientific Zionist scam, but the top politicians knew that scientists had to apply it in order to make atomic bombs.<BR>Secondly, historical materialism.<BR>Contrary to the Marxist doctrine, the judicial and political superstructure determined the production relations and the economic structure in communist countries. The latter were a living example that Marx was wrong.<br />As many revolutionaries, Milovan Djilas was disillusioned by the policies of the left who had taken power in East European countries. He saw the deadly infighting amongst the leaders, the rising reactionary bureaucracy, the liquidation of all political, philosophical, economical or social opposition and the absolutist power of the party. The small power elite milked the state budget for their own profit. The leaders became completely poisoned by the divine and devilish sensual pleasures of the wielding of uncontrolled power.<BR>Therefore, Djilas stresses the all importance of a radical opposition. He could only dream of a parliamentarian one.<br />This book contains also an excellent comment on the May 68 revolt in Paris, an in depth critic of Lenin's 'Der Imperialismus als hoechstes Stadium des Kapitalismus\\" or of the vagaries of Simone de Beauvoir.<BR>This excellent book should be read, at least, by all leftist die-hards.	2004-06-05

Their answer is: big corporations (Enron) and right-wingers (e.g. P. Owen).<BR>Their examples of the policies are clearly illustrated by cleverly chosen individual stories. They show that Bush's government tries to copy his Texas policies nationwide, where ergonomic and environmental laws were arranged to favor the food, chemical and oil industries. <BR>Another loser is education, which is a key factor in national wealth creation: 'the government is spending less money on education reform than they were offering Turkey to accept US troops' (in the Iraq war). (p.89)<BR>The Bush Administration is nominating extremists as judges. <BR>The sex obsessed part of his Administration tries to restrict information on sexual transmitted infections, contraception and abortion. As an example, the US delegates at the UN Special Session on Children objected to a section calling for services to children in post-conflict situations, because they were afraid that might include girls who had been raped and who could be offered an abortion or even emergence contraception.

One blatant sign is its unconditional support of Israel in the Palestinian conflict.<BR>Scruton's essay is based on abstract concepts (membership, religion, the muslims, the West, the Rest, authority). But 'religion' doesn't exist, there are only 'religions' (thousands of sects).<BR>He sees 'loss of membership' as one of the main reasons for Western decadence. Membership (or solidarity) is not a basic need for mankind. People become member of something if there is a personel gain or plus.<br />Some of his ideas are very difficult to swallow.<BR>Preposterous is his statement that 'the French Revolution should primarely be seen as a religious phenomenon'. One of the most important backers of the Enlightenment (Le Grand Orient de France) professes that 'believing in a God is a serious mental disease'.<BR>Or, 'It is from a deficit of membership that the urge to revolution arises'. This is plain nonsense. People are revolting when they are exploited or when their individual basic needs or rights (food, land, shelter, freedom) are in danger or not respected.<BR>Further, 'Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori!' This is beautiful but bare nonsense, when we see all the draft dodgers. Powerful families keep their offspring at bay and fight with mercenaries.<BR>Another of his obsessions is the 'devastating pornography'. Adult pornography is a terribly banal item compared with the raped, crippled, blind, radioatively infected victims (soldiers and citizens) of wars, or the child abuses by religious 'authorities'. I have never heard that someone was killed by pornography. The maxim should be: Make love, not war!<BR>He found that one of the reasons of the 9/11catastrophy was the fact that the perpetrators received a technical education. Would that mean that not everyone deserves one?<br />Roger Scruton's solution for our 'problems', and a key concept of this book is 'authority'. Whose authority? Whose religion?<BR>Because of its instilling of authority, Roger Scruton is a great admirer of Islamic education (based on learning by heart of the Koran). Some minor (even indirect) field work would have revealed the appalling message professed (until recently?) in Islamic schools.<br />His big enemies are dictators and religious fanatics. He forgets to mention that the Taliban and the madrasas in Pakistan and Afghanistan were created by Western intelligence services. Those services installed or supported Greek colonels, dictatorships in Indonesia, Argentina, the Philippines, Saudi-Arabia, Iran, Iraq ... I could go on. They attacked or undermined democratically elected presidents. A recent example is president Chavez in Venezuela (see the remarkable movie 'The revolution will not be televized').<BR>Another big part of his solution is a reinforcement of the nation-state, in other words, nationalism. But the nation-state is dominated (directly or indirectly) or overrun by transnational companies. The solution is a reinforcement of international authorities (UN, ILO, GATT, Europe ...).<br />Like other readers I found this book frightening, but for other reasons. I am frightened that people should have to live in Roger Scruton's nation-state with superior Islamic schools, no technical education and under his authority.	2004-06-02

Rae struggles with the conceptual and philosophical implications of quantum physics (qf).<BR>His book contains excellent explanations of the destruction of determinism, because uncertainty and indeteterminism are built into qf's very foundations. He also rejects the 'hidden variables' solution to solve qf's apparent contradictions. He shows also the fundamental opposition between Einstein and Bohr.<BR>Unfortunately, this book contains a comment on the out-of-date Popper-Eccles discussion on the body/mind problem and their statement that the mind is not subject to the laws of physics. This problem has been resolved (see V. Ramachandran's linguistic solution in 'Phantoms in the brain', or G. Edelman's 'A universe of consciousness').<BR>But I found certain flaws in the author's reasoning due mainly to the choice of bad examples.<BR>Firstly, let me state one fundamental specification: reality is a process, not a fact (L. Smolin).<BR>That is the reason why his ultimate question 'If reality is only what is observed ...' is not a good one.<BR>A qf measurement does not create the 'only' reality. Protons, electrons, dead or alive cats, DNA mutations exist, even if they are not observed. A qf measurement is part of the universal process. In qf we only measure complementarities (properties) as Bohr stated.<BR>Secondly, A. Rae states that macroscopic processes are irreversible (the second law of thermodynamics) and microscopic ones reversible.<BR>For reversibility he chooses as example the collision of two molecules. I doubt firmly that in our universe after the collision the molecules can (without an exterior intervention) go back to their initial states. Those interactions are 'theoretically' reversible.<BR>On the other hand, the life or death of a cat is a macroscopic event. The cat example is a good 'figure' to explain the qf theory, but it is a bad one to build a conceptual or philosophical theory on it. Nobody will calculate the outcome of a certain event based on a dead/alive scenario if a simple look at the cat's condition can eliminate 50% of the possibilities. The same goes for the DNA mutations.<BR>The theory of I. Prigogyne (his books are difficult) is certainly a step in the good direction. As reality is a process, indeterminism should also be the fundamental cornerstone for classical physics, but naturally not in our daily Euclidian life.<BR>In the case of the 'many worlds' question, I prefer Rudolf Peierls's solution where he proposes to speak of many world 'possibilities' (see P. Davies' 'The ghost in the atom').<BR>This is a thought-provoking book. Not to be missed.	2004-05-31

'Wealth is power, says Smith, quoting Hobbes'.<BR>The subject over which the veil is spread is a specific social order: capitalism.<BR>Economists anthropomorphize property. 'Land, labour and capital' are identified as the 'factors of production', whereby the crucial social difference between labour and property is elided.<BR>Certainly, Adam Smith was not duped: 'Civil government as far as it is instituted for the security of property is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor.'<BR>R. Heilbroner shrewdly analyses capitalism as an amoral ideology, which is not a sufficient condition for freedom. Therein, he considers work as a fundamental expression of subordination (also to get power or prestige) and as opposite to freedom (the 'activities' in a pre-capitalist society). And he rightly quotes Jevons: 'the value of labour must be determined by the value of the product, not the value of the product by the value of labour.'<br />But he is far from being a rabid anti-capitalist. On the contrary, he recognizes its huge potential as a wealth creating machine.<BR>What he castigates magisterially is the (un)conscious and untold ideological prejudices behind the 'economic' viewpoints of Milton Friedman, Jude Wanniski, George Gilder and others.<BR>This book is a remarkable reflection by a superb free mind. A must read.	2004-05-31

If his master plays the fascist's game, he will excuse him and protest that he is not an anti-Semite, but he will fire the Jewish household personnel without the slightest regret. If his master changes his ideas, no problem, he goes with him. That's what he calls 'dignity' or 'carrying out his duties to the best of his abilities'.<BR>That is also what Eichmann said or the brutal executioners in Pol Pot's death camp. Those are the words of today's cold career men.<BR>Stevens accepts unflinchingly his fatality:'that the likes of you and I will never be in a position to comprehend the great affairs of today's world, and our best course will always be to put our trust in an employer' (p.211) or 'The hard reality is that for the likes of you and me, there is little choice other than to leave our fate, ultimately, in the hands of those great gentlemen at the hub of this world who employ our service.'

Mencken castigates the irrationality and incredibility of all religions, e.g. there are 175.000 discrepancies in the manuscripts of the Christian New Testament.<BR>But he considers religion rightly as one of ( for him) the greatest inventions of all times, giving the clergy enormous economical (all the temples became extremely rich) and political power. For Mencken, their power comes from the fear of Hell. The God of love that they preach invariably turns out to be a God of harsh and arbitrary penalties and brutalities. Religion is not only cruel (human sacrifices), but also a source of enormous human misery: 'Is a Catholic bishop a good citizen, when he commands, on penalty of Hell, that poor and miserable women convert themselves into mere brood sows?'(p. 270)<BR>'The priest is the most immoral of men.' (p. 271)<BR>His major targets are Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.<BR>'Calvin was the true father of Puritanism, which is to say, of the worst obscenity of Western Civilization.' (p. 245) His God is an 'appalling monster'. (p. 272)<BR>The Churches are well aware that science is their natural enemy. Therefore, they try to control education. They are always on the defensive (Galileo, Darwin) and they are opposed to all attempts of rational thinking. For Mencken, religious education is the same as organized ignorance.<BR>He lambasts those who defend religion for 'practical' reasons: 'the fact that threats of Hell have their social uses is ... simply an argument against the human race!' (p. 268)<BR>However, H.L. Mencken has a dark side: 'the democratic pestilence'. Like Plato, he was disgusted with the masses which were a source of a cancerous proliferation of demagogy. More, 'the reigning theologians heated up the mob against the enlightened minority.' (p. 255)<BR>It shows his deep pessimism: the masses could not be educated and the mighty priests kept them in an irrational darkness.<BR>This is an important flaw in his reasoning and it turned out to be a false prophesy. In many democratic countries, the religious right is on the defensive and is losing (lost) important battles.<BR>This treatise is one of the most violent pamphlets I ever read: a Homerian battle of the enlightened one against the powerful caste of the priests.<BR>A must read.	2004-05-21

First, the war debts ( at a rate of 30 %) which were subscribed by the very rich, who could so keep a stranglehold on the government. Secondly, the tax system that favoured consumption over investment. But at the end of his book the author states: 'The defining event ... was clearly the black death'.<BR>The problem for Victorian Britain was not a mountain of debt, but fear of debt, as well as the flawed income tax system, which favoured 'repair costs' over new investments. There was no provision for capital depreciation. But again, the author indicates another important factor at the end of his book: 'unexspected increase in population'.<BR>The downfall of Britain didn't happen during the reign of Queen Victoria. As we can read in R. Skidelsky's magnificent biography of J.M. Keynes (part 2), 50 % of all commercial credits in the world were financed by Britain in 1914. The beginning the downfall of the British Empire were the war debts it contracted for World War I in the US.<BR>The section on the US is partly out-of-date, because the analysis stops in 1990. But, the proposed remedies are still very actual: investment in education and in research &amp; development. His third remedy 'VAT' would overhaul the whole US tax system. But even a modest rate would generate enormous income for the federal government.<BR>The author also recognizes some big economic issues as personal debt v.savings, or the long-term Social Security problem.<BR>After the Clinton years, the US government is again confronted with a huge budget deficit. I agree with the comment by R.Heilbroner (cited in this book): 'The deficit is an excuse to strip away fifty years of social progress, leaving the economy a hard, cruel place for the poor'. (p. 192)<BR>For an evaluation of the actual US economic policies, I recommend 'The Judas Economy' by W. Wolman and A. Colamosca.<BR>This book is a very mixed bag.	2004-05-19

One Year in the Khmer Rouge's S-21	Books	5	10	11	N	N	We were just tools for them to use	This book is a prime eye-witness of the slaughtering at Pol Pot's secret prison S-21 in Red Khmer Cambodia. Vann Nath is one of the seven (!) inmates out of more than 14000, who survived the bloodshed, because as a painter he could provide useful big portraits of Pol Pot.<BR>What is remarkable in this book is the fact that Vann Nath forgives his former torturers: 'We were just tools for them to use'.<BR>Nonetheless, he regrets that 'Pol Pot died unpunished ... and perhaps the surviving Khmer Rouge leaders will never be punished.' (p. 118)<BR>This book contains some pictures of the author's gripping paintings about this horrible prison, where whole families (men, women, children and BABIES) were clubbed unconscious with iron bars before their throats were cut.<BR>The author is one of the main characters of the remarkable documentary movie by Rithy Panh 'S21 - The Khmer Rouge Death Machine'. A chilling masterpiece.<BR>I must also recommend the magisterial analysis of Pol Pot's death camp by Prof. David Chandler 'Voices from S-21'.<BR>A must read.	2004-05-18

(A. Koestler: 'starving children looked like embryos out of alcohol bottles'.)<BR>He clearly explains the reader that it was an ideological as well as a political scheme; ideological, because it aimed at replacing private agriculture (the kulaks) by collective farms; political, because it aimed at crushing the Ukranian minority. The result was about 15 million deaths through deportation, starvation or direct liquidation.<BR>This book contains excellent historical, political and ideological (Marx, Engels) background on the collectivization problem which would haunt the USSR until his final days: bureaucratization and rampant inefficiency.<BR>Robert Conquest's book gives us an appalling picture of Lenin's terror reign and, after his death, of the power struggle at the top of the CP. The outcome was that one man through one party wielded totally uncontrolled power in an enormous country. He had even the power to inflict genocides without having to justify himself.<BR>This book shows the USSR as a ghost state (reflected in the media) where all contact with reality was lost, as so brilliantly described in Ismail Kadare's novels. For the bureaucrats terror and obedience to any order from above became a normal method of administration.<BR>When one ultimately askes why and how all those, humanly speaking, devastating facts could happen, I should remind the last words of Prof. David Chandler's magisterial book on Pol Pot's death camp 'Voices from S-21': 'the real truth ... is to be found in ourselves'.<BR>The Ukranian genocide is not unique in the 20th century with its Nazi camps, Indonesian, Rwandan, Armenian or Bosnian mass killings.<BR>A terrible but necessary book.<BR>I should also recommend a prime eye-witness of this tragedy: Miron Dolot's 'The Hidden Holocaust'.	2004-05-17

Keynes is nearly totally concentrated on economic issues. Keynes' personal life was perfectly settled after his marriage with a Russian ballerina. He continued to be in contact with the Bloomsbury group, which 'remained subversive by habit, but was anxious to retain their dividends and beauftiful houses'.<BR>In fact, this book centres on the question how Keynes came to write the 'General Theory' and its defense of governmental intervention (public investments) in the economic cycle in order to break the capitalistic slump. He proved that in a laisser-faire system an equilibrium could be formed at a far lesser level than 'natural' unemployment: 'There is work to do, there are men to do it. Why not bring them together!'<BR>We discover that Malthus was a real influential precursor with his proposition to prop up insufficient demand by public works and that Richard Kahn made a decisive contribution with his multiplyer effect.<BR>Prof. Skidelsky characterizes perfectly the 'General Theory' as a complex psychological drama with as main characters the life-denying rentier, the businessman and his fantasies and the victimized working class.<BR>Keynes' ultimate nightmare was a world were making money triumphed over making things, which is actually happening. Financial transactions are dwarfing the industrial ones and there are many more investment trusts than industrial companies in the US.<BR>The discussions after the publication of the 'General Theory' are fascinating. In fact, the debate is still red hot: inflation/deflation, the influence of the (inter)national banks, savings and (un)employment.<BR>This book is not an easy read. I recommend readers to (re)read some parts of the 'General Theory'. But this work is a fascinating tale about the (r)evolution of the ideas of the greatest economist of all times.<BR>I have only one minor remark: Ibsen is a Norwegian, not a Swede.	2004-05-14

While in the Iliad the Gods are omnipotent, in the Odyssey 'they cannot prevent that those who are mortal die' and 'human catastrophies are man-made, not the faults of the Gods'.<br />Compared with the Iliad, the Odyssey is more a story-telling than a poetic epic with few Homeric comparisons or lenghty enumerations.

Half (sic) of the world's trade was financed by British credits in 1914.<BR>It pictures the education of young Keynes, groomed by his parents for the highest civil duties, his acceptance in the exclusive Cambridge Apostles Circle (a main discussion point was Higher Sodomy) and his membership of the, in all aspects, anarchic Bloomsbury group. It shows without restaint Keynes' (homo)sexual awakening and his conventional (based on the Gold Standard) beginnings as an economist.<BR>In the meantime, this book reveals the functioning of the British elitist School system (Eton, Cambridge) as well as the 'moral' environment of this period: the death of God and the birth of mass democracy.<BR>Prof. Skidelsky's book contains a wealth of information on e.g. the conservative reasoning behind the Gold Standard, Utilitarianism or Moore's essentialistic, but influential, ethic system.<BR>He shows us Keynes as a fundamental nationalist: 'it is better to have Englishmen running the world than foreigners'.<BR>But nothwithstanding his exhausting efforts, he saw Britain and mainland Europe sinking under the war debts and being taken over by the US as world power, which was effectively controlled by one man, J.P. Morgan.<BR>He attacked severely the Versailles Treaty but was devastated that politicians preferred suicidal short-time revenge and election success rather than long-time beneficial solutions.<BR>This book is sometimes too detailed with extensive letter excerpts.

It secures also an environment of high real intrest rates. But when the financial sector gets in trouble, it asks the government (all the tax payers) to step in, e.g. the bailout of the savings and loan industry.<BR>The authors castigate rightly supply-side economics as a policy of lowering tax rates for the rich and at the same time as a money-raising vehicle for the GOP.<BR>They show clearly that small businesses are not the cornerstone of job creation.<BR>The position of the US work force is also beleaguered by powerful trends in world capitalism with the rise of India and China and their cheap labour force.<BR>The authors prescribe sensible measures to reverse the trend: public investment (infrastructure), improved education and research and development.<BR>But I don't believe that these measures can stop the immensely powerful shift that is taken place from the US/European markets to Asia.

As a counterpart, they collected her fees until the total investment was paid back.<BR>One of the most influential words in this biography is 'sold', beginning with the poor parents who were forced to sell their female children for sheer survival, over the geisha's virginity (here remarkably sold 4 times) to the milking of her protector.<BR>This unvarnished book gives an appalling picture of the condition of the poor (the greatest part of the population) and more grimly the female poor in Japan up to the nineteen fifties of the past century. Life was a bitter struggle for survival on a diet of white rice, which many could not afford to buy every day.<BR>This heartrending life story of a still more or less top class sex worker (there were lower ones) portraits us dreadfully that 'geisha were not considered to be human beings' (p. 76).<BR>Nonetheless, Sayo Masuda told us a very 'human' story.<BR>Not to be missed.	2004-05-05

Brown or Lewis Feuer. And who's still interested in Herbert Marcuse's philosophy, which is also based on Freud's theories?<br />The discussions of the 1960s evaporated on the hot plate of new scientific discoveries in physics, biology or cosmology. The coming to the centre stage of critical rationalism sealed the death of psychoanalysis as a science.<br />The biographical part of the essay on Joseph Conrad is certainly a worth-while read, but the analysis of 'Hearth of Darkness' is psychoanalysis at its worst. The essay doesn't even discover why Kurtz did what he did.<br />The main discussion point of this book 'consider a literary text as a clinical document' seems to us now a blatant non-event. As the author says it himself, 'warping literary evidence to meet presuppositions'. (p. 64)<br />On the contrary, the fallacy of Wilhelm Reich's theory, his irrationality and unwillingness to be judged by rational scepticism, are clearly exposed.<br />The essays on the New Left of the 1960s are very revealing as they show that those 'philosophers' tried to convert literature into mere propaganda for their cause, a return to Agitprop and Proletkult.<br />His paragaphs on capitalism (e.g. p. 109) are still accurate and could have been written by Michael Parenti.<br />The last essay shows the evolution of the author from a devout adept of psychoanalysis to a more critical investigator ('biases characterize the social sciences' p. 159)<br />Three stars for its historical relevance.	2004-05-05

The fellaha's battle to escape her humble fortune is mingled with her emotional love life and the more or less violent advances of some residents.<br />Like Kurosawa in his magisterial movie 'Rashomon' (based on a short novel by Ryunosuke Akutagawa), the evolving story is told from (here) four different angles (persons), revealing slowly the real motives behind the different clashes.<br />This novel contains some typical Mahfouz characters, like the career man, the wealthy playboy or the impostor ('employed by one master, serving secretly another').<BR>Some themes are also familiar: 'If you have power, you have everything', or 'Everyone else around us behaves as if they didn't believe in God's existence'.<BR>The novel is also a reflection on the failure of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952: 'But was there an alternative? Only the Communists or the Muslim Brotherhood.'<br />This is surely a worth-while read, but the book has not quite the finesse of its Japanese example.	2004-03-27

Like arranged marriages, arranged lives kept people waiting for something to happen. The carrot was career promotion, if you marched along the party lines. The stick was discredit and displacement.<BR>Of course, those rules applied only to the common of mortals. The bunch of mostly corrupt party bosses could live a more exciting life and profit fully from their uncontrolled power.<br />This sometimes poignant, sometimes boring novel has not the same high standard as 'The Crazed', which was far more appealingly constructed, although it dealt with the same themes.	2004-03-27

It is based on two different concepts: psychoanalysis (Freud) and evolution (Darwin).<br />For the author, psychoanalysis is not a pseudo-science, but a real method for scientific research. All 'psycho' experiments can in all circumstances be corroborated. This is plain nonsense. Psychoanalysis is not a science, but that doesn't mean that it is without substance, as literature is not without substance.<BR>Lynn Margulis accepts nearly all parts of Freud's theory, and cites without criticism the post-Freudians Lacan (for him, Freud is much more important than Darwin!) and Derrida. Their ridiculous semiotic open (!) texts are a magisterial example of what Jean Fourastie called 'conceptual deliriums', e.g. Lacan's definition of one of the basic elements of his theory, the phallus. One must read it, to believe the plain nonsense of his concepts.<BR>For a severe criticism of Freud, I recommend 'The Memory Wars' by Frederick Crews.<br />The evolutionary part is better, although it contains a lot of 'ifs' and is more or less a compilation of and comments on citations of others, like S.J. Gould, D. Morris and G.C. Williams.<BR>I prefer the works of Robin Baker, G.C. Williams, or even the 'Darwinian' part of Steven Pinker's 'How the mind works'.<br />A plus point is the humoristic style (e.g., how God made a lot of mistakes when he created man in his own image) and the popular treatment of a long time taboo subject.<BR>Newcomers will still learn a lot about sex and penises.	2004-02-20

Nechaev	This novel is a contradiction in terms.<BR>The confrontation between Nechaev (the author of the 'Revolutionary's Catechism'), his disciple Pavel and the writer Dostoevsky, Pavel's stepfather, is an essential one. It's the eternal problem of, in the words of Jorge Semprun - L'ecriture ou la Vie -, writing (reflection, literature) or living (action, politics).<br />In the beginning, Nechaev is portrayed as a fundamentalist, an anarchist full of hatred, who curses the intellectuals, because they don't eliminate the old way of thinking.<BR>But at the end, Pavel (his follower) is considered as a martyr for a just cause ('he gave himself up for the future').<BR>Dostoevsky, on the contrary, ends as a writer of 'perversions of the truth' and as an ink-slinger, 'who receives lots of money for writing books in return for his soul'.<BR>So, the winner of the confrontation is Nechaev, the pure and revolutionary politician, against perhaps (and for me) the greatest writer of all times.<br />In our world, we need the two of them, philosophers and experimenters, and the latter are mostly influenced by the former, otherwise their experiments are hot air.<BR>Also, the case of Dostoevsky is a special one, because he had to write (and to gamble) in order to try to reimburse the debt he inherited from his family.<br />Apart from this controversy, the novel contains some weaknesses. The parricide theme is flawed, because Pavel is a stepson. There are also some melodramatic passages (e.g. Matryona: 'I would like to have a child with you').<br />This novel is certainly not an easy text. But, even if I don't agree with its basic thesis, I must recommend it, because it treats fundamental questions and it forces the reader at least to reflect upon them.	2004-02-19

The author spent as a student some years in Moscow, where he met socialist realism writers. It was a terrible deception. The USSR's intellectual living conditions foreshadowed the author's own fate in his home country.<br />His analysis is deadly: the members of the writer's guild of the USSR are blatant conformists, staunch flatterers, frustrated socialists, calumniators and corrupt informers.<BR>They are a bunch of cowards, who know very well the realities before and behind the curtains, but don't have the courage to write about it. They are perfect yodellers and prefer to drivel on 'shepherds and shepherdesses' themes.<br />To cap it all, he saw and heard the immense gruesome machinery put in place to insult Boris Pasternak, when he won the Nobel Prize. A whole country was mobilized through the media to spit on the author. Kadare was devastated by that macabre example of the machinations of a dictatorial one party State against one of his most brilliant citizens.<br />This novel has the main high standard as the cynical an biting book by C.

These dissidents are now more or less troubled men in exile, full of disillusion and desperation, even fleeing into religion, but still bickering with and criticizing their fellow travellers.<BR>Although they showed enormous courage, the truth is that they were not really a threat for the regime. As Ian Buruma states rightly: 'The Communist government fears rebellious workers far more than students and intellectuals.'<br />This book contains a wealth of information on China and the Chinese Diaspora.<BR>It contains painful interviews with victims of the Cultural Revolution who suffered horrifying tortures, as well as a harsh report on the Shenzhen zone and a correct evaluation of the Falun Gong movement.<BR>The author sketches a terribly bleak picture of Singapore's dictator Lee Kuan Yew, who couldn't support the slightest criticism and who crushed even the mildest of his opponents.<BR>He gives us also an excellent historical and actual portrait of Taiwan with the bloody Kuomintang invasion and the brutal dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek.<BR>One minus point: in his distinguished portrait of Tibet he fails to mention the fact that Tibetans were trained by the CIA as invasion troops for an attack on Mao's China.<BR>With every report and interview, the author illuminates different aspects of the Chinese mentality (Confucianism, zige, xenophobia, self-loathing ...)<br />This book is a magisterial achievement and a must read for all those interested in the history of China.	2004-02-18

I would like to stress only some important points in my comment.<br />One should have a rather good knowledge of basic algebra, statistics, botany and biology to fully understand this book.<br />This is a key text about Darwinism. Its influence cannot be overestimated, as show a few excerpts hereafter: 'there is nothing in the basic structure of the theory of natural selection that would suggest the idea of any kind of cumulative progress' and 'Evolution was a by-product of the maintenance of adaptation'.<BR>These sentences are cornerstones of today's theories on Darwinism (see the works of the late S.J. Gould or Richard Dawkins).<br />In a cool style, but with compelling arguments, the author wipes the floor with his opponents' theories about group adaptations, instead of adaptations on the individual level.<BR>He also stresses the fundamentally different roles of male and female mammals for the production of offspring and the evolutionary impact of female choice.<br />But there is more: (adapted sentence)'If some organisms were not entirely self-seeking, they, and Nature in general, would be more ethically acceptable. In most theological systems it is necessary that the creator be benevolent and that this benevolence is shown in his creation. If Nature is found to be malicious or morally indifferent, the creator is presumably too. For many, peace in mind might be difficult with the acceptance of these conclusions, but this is hardly a basis for making decisions in biology'.<BR>This sentence is still today too big a swallow for the moral elite, unable to comprehend their own Darwinian behaviour and unable to think about the fact that 'natural selection, albeit stupid, is a story of unending arms races, slaughter and suffering' (G.C. Williams in 'Plan and Purpose in Nature').<br />An essential book by a superb free mind.	2004-01-03

They are more intended for the Cambodian scholar.<br />The whole book sketches a good impression of the general Cambodian mentality: deference and fatalism rather than rebelliousness. What changed the whole picture and became a tragedy for the country was the fact that it became a football in the deadly Cold War game between, on the one side, China and the US(!) who supported the Red Khmer and, on the other side, the USSR who supported Vietnam.<br />The Pol Pot regime was an exceptional phenomenon imported from the West, because all the men in charge of Angkar were recruited and 'educated' in France by the Stalinist PC.<br />Some essays contain more general comments on the Pol Pot regime and the more actual Cambodian situation, but readers interested in those problems should read prof.

Into the bargain, it poses the right question: who benefited?<br />The author presents a strong case that the 9/11 attacks were a miscalculated provocation - the extent of the damage was grossly underestimated.<BR>To support his thesis, Ahmed piles up a wealth of information: e.g. the leader of the 9/11 attacks received money from the chief of the Pakistani intelligence, who acted in accord with other US covert actions; the Taliban and the madrasas were set up by the US; the FBI's failure to apprehend suspected terrorists was the result of high level blocks; an inquiry into this intelligence failure was also blocked; Bin Laden had powerful protectors in Washington; intelligence agencies had extensive advance warnings of the attacks and were in various ways complicit in those attacks; the US defence system had amply the time to intercept the hijacked planes, but did nothing ... One can go on!<br />Apparently, powerful elements in the intelligence community and the Bush Administration believed that a 'minor' damage would contribute to a 'greater good' for those in power. This greater good was 'still more power to the powerful': the Pentagon, the CIA, the FBI, the weapons industry, the oil industry and their Bush Administration.<br />In fact, those are the winners of the 'War on Terror', by giving nearly almighty power to the intelligence units: a coup d'etat against the US constitution with curtailment of civil liberties, basic freedoms and human rights. On the other hand, the US defence budget reaches new highs and military intervention with nuclear weapons is now planned. A peace dividend is farther away than ever.<br />The author explains clearly the geostrategic importance of Afghanistan for the exploration of the enormous oil and gas reserves in the Caspian region.<BR>He even predicted the military intervention in Iraq.<br />This is a very disturbing and frightening book with a perfect title.

He shows that Japanese politics in the last half of the 20th century was firmly controlled by four men, with Kakuei Tanaka as the most predominant tycoon.<br />Tanaka's tactics were very simple: use his home base as a platform for his political career by lavishy spending state money in his election district and by buying votes; use his financial clout to control the Japanese majority party; become still richer by corrupting the state bureaucracy, bid-rigging (200 % and more margin) and briberies (by private companies).<br />In fact, the author shows clearly that the whole system was controlled by a corrupt oligachy.<BR>The men in power were not afraid of racket type interventions. One example: the ruling government proposed stiff taxes on automobiles. After the automobile industry paid heavy contributions to the party in charge, the bill was watered down.<br />This book is an exemplary analysis of a corrupt political system. Not to be missed.	2003-12-26

Here he does it again with the latest progress in the search for a theory of quantum gravity: loop quantum gravity, string theory and black hole thermodynamics.<BR>He dissects the strenghts and weaknesses of the different approaches and shows how they culminate into the holographic principle, where one set of events receives information about other parts of the world.<br />Lee Smolin explains in a very comprehensible vocabulary that space and time are not continuous, but discrete; that the world is made of processes, not things; and that the world is nothing more than an evolving network of relationships, of which causality is the most important.<BR>These characteristics have important philosophical implications; e.g. they refute the belief that observer dependence rules out objectivity.<br />This book contains some mind-boggling propositions. One from Lee Smolin himself, where he admits that he doesn't belief in the uncertainty principle, although he continues to work with it. Another one is the use of the whole universe as an instrument.<br />In the end, the author is very optimistic and predicts that a theory of quantum gravity will be found in the first decades of the 21st century.<br />This book is a fascinating tale about the real nature of the universe. A must read.	2003-12-26

Darwin's theory is the route to knowledge	This book is a compilation of 18 pioneering articles on Darwinism.<BR>Very original is the fact that the different authors are commenting on their research 10 or more years after the publication.<br />One needs a rather profound knowledge of statistics in order to fully understand some, not all, the articles.<br />These researches were not only very original but sometimes also disturbing, like Hrdy's work on infanticide, or Chagnon's research on the Yanomanö tribe, which was used against the tribe by 'financial' interests in the 'development' of their territory.<br />For me, the most important article was the one by Tooby and Cosmides, who brilliantly refuted and even ridiculed the SSS Model of the content-free, independent mind. They proved that the human mind is not a blank which works with general purpose mental processes. On the contrary, the mind contains specialized mechanisms which evolved as adaptations to the social environment (see also, Lumsden and Wilson's 'Promethean Fire').<br />This book is an essential read for all those who are interested in the human nature.	2003-12-26

The meaning of the words is identical with the objects pictured. So, words are a picture of the external world (Wittgenstein!).<br />A large part of the book concerns the high quality of the Sumerian literature. It influenced the Bible (the paradise and the creation of man), the Greek and most of all the Acadian literature with 'The Descent of Ishtar in the Underworld' (to raise the dead) and the Epic of Gilgamesh (the quest for eternal life).<br />The Sumerian history shows us that from the beginning of mankind very 'modern' problems surfaced: taxation to finance wars, the struggle between the temple and the palace or the battle between the few (powerful) and the many.<br />A very interesting book, not only for historians.	2003-12-26

It reflected the unlimited paranoia of Angkar and its schizophrenic regime that 'was at once terrified and terrifying, omnipotent and continually under threat'.<BR>All family members (women, children and BABIES) of the condemned were slaughtered. Only 7 of the 14000 inmates survived.<br />As prof. Chandler remarks chillingly: 'a reign of terror and continuous revolution requires a continuous supply of enemies.'<BR>There were no limits. As one of the interrogators rightly asked: 'If Angkar arrests everybody, who will be left to make a revolution?'<br />The same subject has been treated by Ben Kiernan in his book 'The Pol Pot regime'. But whereas Ben Kiernan sees racism as the main motive behind the murderous regime, prof. Chandler digs far deeper and concludes clinically that 'the real truth behind S-21 is to be found in ourselves'!<BR>Indeed, the S-21 experience is not unique in the 20th century with its Nazi camps, communist show trials, Indonesian, Rwandan and Bosnian mass killings, Argentinean tortures ...<BR>He remarks also that the Cambodian regime was an imported phenomenon. The Khmer leaders were all recruited and educated by the Stalinist French PC in the 1950s.<br />This nearly unbearable book should be read as a reminder that 'ordinary people can commit demonic acts' (R. F. Lifton).<BR>David Chandler is not afraid to say 'how things really are' (L. Betzig).<br />A terrifying book about a terrifying experience.	2003-12-24

Galbraith there are three sorts of power (condign, compensating and conditioned) and three sources of power (personality, property and organization).<BR>With these elements he sketches a historical evolution of the West from feudalism to capitalism, integrating as diverse aspects as politics, economics, religion, the family, the military, advertising, media and education.<br />This book was written in 1983, in a sometimes cynical tone, especially in the comments on politicians, businessmen and the military. It contains positive and negative elements.<br />The author predicted the omnipotence of the military and the intelligence organizations, as well as their obsessive need for a specific enemy.<BR>He saw the rise of the organizational power, but not the fact that the influence of the transnational corporations would dwarf state and trade union power (see N. Hertz - The silent take-over).<BR>A mistake is his underestimation of the power of the media and their message controlled by the powerful.<BR>Also, the Darwinian aspect of power is not commented on.<br />But, this small book is still a very worth-while read.	2003-12-24

(p.46)<br />As G.

The same 'merit' should also justify the enormous income differences in the US.<br />Toby Young's biography centres on the glossy magazine 'Vanity Fair' and his misadventures as a junior writer. It contains the well-known ingredients of booze, drugs, sex, the homo/hetero battle and his unwelcome English 'hooligan' behaviour.<br />In fact, besides some thoughts about 'de Tocqueville, freedom and the US', his work is nearly a 'colossal waste of time' (the author's own words) and certainly not more than somewhat better gossip for insiders about totally uninteresting people.	2003-11-12

His solution for Albania - to base the whole society on 'oaths' - seemed to me rather naïve.

The 'Vietnam Project' is a psychological analysis, while the South African story is an excerpt of a diary relating the facts.<BR>The 'Vietnam project' portraits a US Ministry of defence employee who works on a psychological warfare project for Vietnam, while in fact he is against the war. This schizophrenic situation and his guilty feelings turn into a depression.<BR>The diary relates the conflict between an explorer and a Hottentot village which leads to a sadistic extermination of the inhabitants.<BR>Both stories seem to be influenced by Freudian psychology, and the last one more specifically by Freud's 'Totem und Tabu'.<br />The writing becomes sometimes a 'text' in the manner of the French 'nouveau roman', a disastrous literary movement influenced by such conceptual deliriums as structuralism and linguistics. The results were cold and empty novels without deep feelings or distinctive social reality, a mere playing with words and esoteric symbols.<br />Coetzee's stories are certainly a worth-while read, but they don't attain a general human level, like e.g. the political novels of Ismail Kadare. They stay more or less pasted to the treated themes.	2003-10-18

A monstrous bureaucratic organization collects those dreams and a monstrous herd of employees classifies and analyzes them. The interpretation of the apparently most important dream is presented every week to the sultan, because it could contain crucial information about the destiny of the country and the ruling families.<BR>The whole country has really turned into a ghost state, where people perform ghost work: Absurdistan.<br />Of course, this macabre ministry is only a veil for the bitter power struggle between the powerful. A bad dream interpretation could create an opportunity to lash out at the other throne contenders with deadly consequences for the innocent common citizens. The for the common man seemingly blind fatality is in fact the result of a deadly fight for control and power between the mighty.<br />Kadare's novel, inspired by Enver Hoxha's Albania, is a masterful portrait of the totalitarian state, where real life is replaced by hallucinations. The government's most important role is to try to control even the dreams of its citizens. A dark nightmarish regime.<br />This highly political work is composed and reads like a thriller.

Control of the oil price is a crucial problem for the West, if it wants to keep its actual living standard.<br />Saddam, in fact, began to act independently as an oil producer and even asked to be paid in Euros (see an important article in the English paper 'The Guardian' of February 26 2003). If this policy should be adopted by other oil producers, the US would not only lose control of the oil reserves, but even of the oil price.<br />Fundamentally however, Ahmed's analysis is based on respect of basic human aspirations: freedom, independence, human rights.<br />One could say that his analysis is naïve (or idealistic), and contrary to 'normal' human behaviour, which is search for power, dominance, unchallenged hegemony. The citations of George F. Kennan and Madeleine Albright in this book are most typical (or should I say, cynical) in that respect.<BR>Ahmed's book is a magnified example of the deeds of an unchallenged political and military power. Of course, as he proves time and again, the international sanctions against Iraq were illegal. Of course, they were intended to the fall of Saddam and the installation of a pro-Western government.<BR>And unfortunately, nobody who wields total power (one needs another analysis why some nations got it and others not) has not exploited it in his own interest or lost it without a struggle (see the masterful analysis of power by Laura Betzig).<br />As a matter of fact, Ahmed himself stops short of giving an opinion on the Iranian situation during and after the reign of the by the author much admired Ayatollah Khomeini, who installed an Islamic shiite oligarchy in Iran.<br />Respect of human rights on the international level can only be imposed by supranational authorities (the UN, an international court). But if these authorities try to take measures against 'vital' interests of one of its members and if that member has enough power, it will neglect all the resolutions and even completely disregard them. Even if it knows that its behaviour equals or installs the 'law of the jungle'.<BR>It is crucial for world peace that the UN should wield international power and be able to impose sanctions.<br />But there is another alarming and frightening aspect of the war in Iraq: freedom of speech was curbed in order to hide the truth.<BR>If the author is correct that US troops fired deliberately at journalists whom they considered not loyal to their cause, then this is the same as the barbarous demolition of the library of Pergamon.<br />This book is a compelling, provocative and must read.	2003-10-03

When someone dies, all his clothes are immediately ripped off by the other inmates.<br />The tales give us also good portraits of the prisoners, who were mostly professors, party bureaucrats, engineers, militia men, peasants or skilled workers, not common criminals. Most of them didn't even know why they were imprisoned and why they had to die, because they weren't against the regime. They were only the naïve victims of arbitrary arrests imposed by a ruthless despot.<br />The tales also relate the dead from exhaustion of the well-known Russian writer Andrey Platonov.<br />This impressive but depressing book should be read as a warning against the unchallenged power of the bureaucracy of a one party state.	2003-10-02

The pyramid becomes a symbol for endless human suffering and death under a despotic regime.<br />Of course, this book is a reflection on the political situation in Albania under the communist tyrant Enver Hoxha, but it is also a magisterial general evocation of a totalitarian ghost state, with only hidden agendas, invented complots, infighting, creation of incidents and rumours, and all that only in function of the mood and hallucinations of the tyrant.<BR>The interrogations, tortures and executions for 'who ever knows' what reasons, create an atmosphere of terror in the whole country.

The young are manifesting on Tiananmen Square against the one party State for more freedom.  But the 'crazed' remain in absolute power and play with the other 'crazed' (the men with a mission).<br />This book depicts China as 'a paradise for idiots', where 'love is a chameleon'. It is a really totalitarian State, but where personal interests are paramount.<BR>The author remarks rightly: 'It's personal interests that motivate the individual and therefore generate the dynamics of history. Our history books on the Communist Revolution have always left out individual motives ... why they joined the Red Army or the Communist Party ... because they wanted to escape an arranged marriage or to avoid debts or just to have enough food and clothes.' (p. 320)<br />This novel is magnificently constructed. The reader discovers slowly the truth behind the actions, deliriums and whisperings.<BR>A really great book written by an accomplished writer.	2003-09-20

It is all the more surprising how great the difficulties were to publish his books, although they constituted a crucial and fundamental philosophical breakthrough.<br />Although, for me, Popper is the greatest philosopher of the 20th century, some of his positions are flawed. He is a dualist (mind/body). His defence of Socrates is also much contested. The Dutch classicist G. Koolschijn pretends that Socrates was not a democrat. He was probably condemned for pleading against democracy in his teachings.<BR>Particularly interesting is Popper's struggle with Heisenberg's Indeterminacy Principle, where he lost the battle with Heisenberg.<BR>I also agree with the author's essential remark that 'socially disadvantaged groups do not have a fair chance of being heard, let alone prevailing, in the so-called democratic political process. Organized elites and corporate interest block, manipulate, and circumvent the channels ... a fairly egalitarian socioeconomic structure and public control of corporations are preconditions to effective democratic dialogue.' (p.543)<br />This book contains an excellent presentation of Wittgenstein's Tractatus and Popper's critique of it. It runs the defenders of Otto Neurath (Cartwright &amp; Co) into the ground.<br />All in all, a fascinating book for those who are interested in modern philosophy and more particularly in Popper's work.<br/>Newcomers should first read the works of Popper himself, or the excellent introduction by Bryan Magee in his small book 'Popper'.	2003-09-18

He wrote a hallucinatory and tragic biography.<br />The background of Pol Pot is common for many Communist Party (CP) members. He was recruited by the local CP when he studied in a foreign country. For Pol Pot, it was in France where the CP was totally controlled by the USSR and her Stalinist doctrine. The USSR recruited foreign members everywhere in order to use them as antennas all over the world.<br />When Pol Pot took power in Cambodia, he applied the Stalinist doctrine ruthlessly.<BR>The similarities with Stalin are eminently striking: power struggle at the top of the party and liquidation of the old fellows, savage party purges, murderous goulags, indiscriminate collectivization, ethnic cleansing, deportation, show trials, forced confessions under torture, affectionate with little daughter, considering as enemies of the State those Khmer who came from a foreign country, fear of assassination, suspicious, dictatorial (didn't accept the slightest form of criticism).<BR>Under Pol Pot, it went even so far that people who 'knew' an enemy where executed. The result: a genocide. Even children and BABIES were put to death.<br />David Chandler shows us that Pol Pot was really a dedicated communist, a party man, an organization man, a utopian thinker who believed in his killer's utopia till the end: \\"I did everything for my country\\". <BR>A blatant lie: he did it only for his Khmer country and only for those Khmer who (were forced to) agree(d) with him. In other words, his utopia was more than nationalism, it was racism. For Pol Pot knew that 'Class and hatred had produced the victory. So hatred had to be maintained'.<br />This book contains excellent explanations of the background of the Cambodian conflict with Vietnam, and how Cambodia became a chess piece in a world conflict between the US, China and the USSR. Pol Pot's regime was supportedby the US, because Cambodia was an enemy of Vietnam, who was an ally of the USSR.<BR>This book stresses also the disastrous role of the feudalist king Norodom Sihanouk and the decisive influence of the US bombings of Cambodia, which turned part of the Khmer peasantry in favour of the Red Khmer.<br />Pol Pot's regime is a shame for Western intelligentsia, because some of his cronies (Khieu Samphan) studied like Pol Pot at Western universities.<br />This terrible biography is a reminder of the deadly dangers of utopian doctrines, if they can be implemented by a totally  convinced individual who possesses a dictatorial power in a single ountry. As David Chandler states: the genocide would have continued, if Pol Pot had stayed in power.<br />A must read.	2003-09-05

You need a strong stomach to read this relentless slaughtering of men, women, children and BABIES. It is quite frankly emotionally and humanly really depressing.<BR>One gets cold in the back when one sees what pure totalitarian ideology and raving racism are capable of, when implemented by a party (or one man) which wields total power in a single country.<br />Ben Kiernan is right when he states that 'the two important themes in the history of the Pol Pot regime are the race question and the struggle for central power by the French-educated Pol Pot group'. All means (relentless infighting and killing) justified the end (take total power). <BR>There is however a third theme: ideology. Total power allowed the implementation of pure ideological policies.<br />Pol Pot's regime was racist, e.g. the liquidation of the Cham people and the ethnic Chinese. This was real ethnic cleansing. But there was more. Ethnic Khmer who came from other countries were considered as enemies and were coldly liquidated.<BR>It was also a totalitarian regime that turned the whole Cambodian country in a monstrous concentration camp. All communication between people was paralyzed: 'know nothing, hear nothing, say nothing'.<BR>Criticizing the infallibility of the Angkar was a crime punishable by the death penalty. But inside Angkar nepotism was rampant.<BR>The similarities with the Stalinist USSR regime are overwhelming.<br />Ben Kiernan stresses rightly the impact of the destabilizing US bombings of Cambodia (about 150000 civilian deaths). Part of the Khmer peasantry was alienated and turned to the Red Khmer.<BR>More, the US supported the Pol Pot regime and, into the bargain, secretary of State Brzezinski tried to get international support for Pol Pot, because he was an enemy of Vietnam. Mind-boggling.<br />This book should be read as a reminder of the murderous sufferingsinflicted on a largely innocent population by a totalitarian and blind ideology, IMPORTED FROM THE WEST.<BR>This should hopefully never happen again. Although we know that, I agree on a lesser scale, some aspects of Pol Pot's dreadful regime are still raging in some parts of the world.<BR>A depressing, but must read.<BR>I also recommend David Chandler's excellent biography of Pol Pot 'Brother Number One'.	2003-09-05

Cosmology is a question of natural selection. This selection happens via black holes, where universes are created with slightly different random new values for the parameters of the standard model in physics.<BR>There are no eternal laws, only worlds which are the result of random and statistical processes of self-organization.<br />I agree, there are a lot of ifs in this book, with a crucial one on p. 93: 'If quantum effects prevent the formation of singularities ... then time does not end in the centre of black holes, but continues into some new region of space-time.'<br />Smolin explains that behind the central principles of relativity and quantum mechanics lies the essential fact that 'All properties of things in the world are only aspects of relations among real things, so that they may be decribed without reference to any absolute background structures.' (p.259)<BR>For Smolin, the future of physics is to find a solution for the tension between the atomist description of elementary particles, and their relational use in the gauge principle. He believes that string theory is part of the solution.<br />Smolin's point of view is partly shared by the late Nobel Prize winner Ilya Prigogine in his difficult book 'The End of Certainty'.<br />Even if his theory is falsified, this book is a real bargain, because it contains magnificently clear (a real bonus) explanations of the 4 basic forces in physics, the gauge principle, symmetry breaking, quantum mechanics, gravity, the second law of thermodynamics, the theory of natural selection, Leibniz's philosophy, the reason why mathematical and logical truths may be eternal ...

They mostly had no other means for survival than prostitution. The brothels were run by ... the clergy and the rich and powerful. William the Conqueror owned three of them.<br />Other damned classes were the slaves and the poor, whose life was at risk every day. As J. Swift said: the poor had no other choice than to 'steal to be hanged'.<br />Overall, the living standard, even for the mighty, was truly catastrophic: absolutely no hygiene, immense spread of venereal diseases, violence, murder, barbarous executions and rampant corruption.<br />The few and the many met each other in the brothels.<br />'Those who were riche were hangid by the Pursse;<br /> Those who were poore were hangid by the Necke.'<br />We find here also a confirmation of Matt Ridley's thesis that the Church tried to prevent that married couples had children. The Holy Fathers had nothing against fornication because they ran the brothels. In fact, the Holy Fathers were not first born masculine children. By preventing that the first born got an heir, they had a chance to take his place and properties.<br />E.J. Burford tells us also who invented the 'cundum'.<br />This book contains excellent naturalistic and expressive illustrations and texts.<br />A very original and important book that constitutes a reminder for everybody of us of 'where we all come from'.<br />A must read.	2003-09-03

This book covers mainly the fifties and sixties of last century, when the author was an important CIA agent in Indonesia, the Philippines and Central and South America.<br />It clearly shows how the CIA (the author) tried to influence directly the political situation in those countries. It supported financially the political party, that it thought would best represent the anti-communist and /or business interests of the US / transnational companies, and it tried to intervene in the composition of govenments.<br />Contrary to other sources, the author denies vehemently that the CIA was behind or committed assassinations.<br />The author explains distinctly the real seasons behind the Vietnam War or the Bay of Pigs disaster and reveals some famous names as CIA creatures: Nasser (Egypt) and Frei (Chile).<br />We meet some very well known people at the beginning of their (in)famous career: Ferdinand Marcos, Sukarno, Lee Kuan Yew, Howard Hunt, Han Suyin.<br />At the end, disillusioned, Joseph Smith turns his back on the Agency; firstly, for personal reasons (people got promotion for their incompetence), and secondly, because of the Vietnam disaster, Watergate, the bureaucratisation of the CIA (at one point drifting to a Gestapo status) and its spying on US citizens (the CHAOS program).<br />This work contains also some comic scenes of how the CIA tried to lure KGB agents in their nets.<br />Fundamentally, it confirms the statement of an old Englishman in Malay:'There are struggles for money, for power, for lust, for greed, because of just plain meanness. But there is no such thing as the ideological struggle...'.<br />A must read in order to understand the ploys of a secret agency.	2003-08-05

This book is a meticulous analysis of Darwin's theory.<BR>The disproof of (the late) Stephen Jay Gould's attack on adaptation and gradualism is brilliant. The refutation of essentialism and the strong anthropic principle is most convincing.<br />But in the last part of this book, the author looses contact with reality, with 'how things really are' (L. Betzig).<br />For Dennett, 'The selfish genes' are not imperative: '... the massively misleading idea that the summum bonum at the source of every chain of practical reasoning is the imperative of our genes'.<BR>For Dennett, 'Human behavior is determined by culture, an autonomous system of symbols and values. Free from biological constraints...' (p.490)<BR>More, 'We have the mind-tools we need to design and redesign ourselves.' (p.510)<BR>To paraphrase Freud, I believe that culture (civilization) creates discontents, for 'selfish genes' reasons.<br />Also his criticism of E.O. Wilson's statement that 'Morality, or more strictly our belief in morality, is merely an adaptation put in place to further our reproductive ends.' (p. 470), is off the mark.<br />The book ends with a hymn on religion: '... all the glories of our religious traditions' (p. 519). But people continue to fight in the name of God. Unbelievable.<br />As Prof. G.C. Williams states in his profound remarks: 'natural selection, albeit stupid, is a story of unending arms races, slaughter and suffering', and 'at least, we should think about it'. Prof. Williams did, Dennett not.<br />One can find a more 'realistic' evaluation of Darwin's idea in the works of L. Betzig, G.C. Williams, E. O. Wilson and S. Pinker's 'How the mind works' (the evolution part of the story).	2003-07-31

This book gives a fairly good look behind the veil of an advertising agency by following the making and the release of, and the reaction on a commercial for a dairy product 'Madone' (the hint is obvious).<BR>It depicts the cynical atmosphere with the ukases of the client, the personal ambitions and deceits, the lick and kick culture, the hire and fire policies, drugs and call-girls.<BR>The ultimate ambition of the agency is to turn mankind into a product with a sell-by date and to create a world of unhappy, frustrated and insatiate consumers, because happy people don't consume.<br />The author was fired by the agency after the release of the book, because too many 'colleagues' recognized themselves in the characters of the book.<br />Unfortunately, the story of the production of the commercial is from time to time interrupted by less forceful tirades of obscenities, love lamentations and far too heavy (anti-capitalist) metaphors.<br />At the end the author has no illusions about the Home sapiens : 'there is no alternative for this world'.<br />This book is sometimes overstretched, but I recommend it as a good portrait of the marketing business, which is an essential part of our modern world.	2003-07-30

Books	5	6	7	N	N	The law of God saith, he that will not work, let him not eat	This book is a magisterial critical evaluation of the thesis of Max Weber 'The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'.<br />Tawney argues rightly that there is an interaction between religion and the social/economical circumstances because 'it seems a little artificial to talk as though capitalist enterprise could not appear till religious changes had produced a capitalist spirit. It would be equally true, and equally one-sided, to say that the religious changes were purely the result of economic movements.' (p. 312)<br />As a matter of fact, the Christian Church itself had changed mightily in the Renaissance. It persecuted the Spiritual Franciscans who followed St Francis' rule of evangelical poverty! It was the richest company in the Western world (see 'A world lit by fire' by W. Manchester).<br />Tawney remarks rightly that what Calvin did for the bourgeoisie of the sixteenth century, Marx did for the proletariat of the nineteenth.<BR>Calvin's success was firmly prepared by Puritan moralists, who stressed thrift, work as an end in itself, efficiency and rational calculation. They paved the way for a shrewd commercial and powerful middle class, which adopted the Calvinist religion and its ethic as a natural ally.<br />This very rich book shows the real impact of Calvinism on the whole society. One example: wages. Calvinism considered 'that high wages are not a blessing, but a misfortune, since they merely conduce to weekly debauches.' (p.267)<br />This is a brilliantly written, colourful, metaphorical, and yet scientific work. It should be an example for all historians and should show them how to present important historical evolutions in a comprehensive and attractive language.<br />This is an essential read for the understanding of our own modern society.	2003-07-06

The first time I was in L.A., a well known actor asked me if there were also as many gays in the European movie business as in Hollywood?<br />This book lifts a veil on that still rather taboo issue. <BR>A few celebrities are mentioned in this book, but I felt that most of the chapters were more for insiders.<br />Fortunately, this book contains also some important movie issues which tell a lot about the mentality of the people who ran (run) the studios.<br />Hollywood's success story is based on its star system. A big panic broke out in the fifties of last century when one of the superstars 'Ingrid Bergman' left Hollywood to marry Roberto Rossellini. The movie bosses were shattered and thought that they would lose a big part of their public (the box office). They launched a big smear campaign against the actress and forced the movie reviewers to criticize heavily her new films. The not so 'orthodox' behaviour of other superstars was left unscathed.<br />The author unveils also the real role of Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons as the 'Big Sisters' of Hollywood, who spied on the stars and employees of the studios on behalf of the bosses. If the crew didn't behave as the bosses wanted, they were called on the carpet and told that 'Unless you show yourself as a respectable person, you'll lose your contract.\\"<br />A decent work on a difficult subject.	2003-07-05

As Peter Dale Scott states in his excellent book 'Deep Politics', McCarthyism was one of the main scandals in the US in the twentieth century.<BR>Therefore, this volume composed by Prof. Fried, with the most important documents about this phenomenon (laws, interrogations, judgments ...) is a most useful reminder of what really happened. Also, his analysis of the facts is objective and to the point.<br />Prof. Fried defines the red scare as 'a mass phenomenon that may have comprised a majority of the electorate, with one abiding passion, that Communism was the sum of human iniquity and that to destroy it all means were justified'. (p. 118)<br />Some of the villains (R. Reagan, R. Nixon, A. Schlesinger Jr., E. Kazan, L.J. Cobb) in this shameful episode of US politics, made brilliant careers afterwards.<br />The justification by those who accused colleagues and friends could be right (e. g. Kazan: The Communists automatically violated the daily practices of democracy), but it was a most inhuman behaviour.<BR>As Lillian Hellman wrote: 'But to hurt innocent people whom I knew many years ago in order to save myself is, to me, inhuman and indecent and dishonorable. I cannot and will not cut my conscience'. (p.138)<br />The overwhelming majority of the accused dropped for good out of their profession. Only a few, like directors Jules Dassin and Joseph Losey, found work in Europe.<br />I must recommend the above mentioned book by Peter Dale Scott, who gives a brilliant analysis of MacCarthyism: who really pulled the strings behind the veil and why it was abruptly stopped.<br />A most necessary reminder of an unnecessary and unjustified witch-hunt.	2003-07-05

Somerset Maugham sums up his vision on mankind, the English, morals and art (theatre, the novel). It is a penetrating and very modern view. The best book I have read from him.<BR>It shows that he had a very profound scientific and philosophical background.<br />His stance on determinism, chance and free will was based on his philosophical and scientific readings (Hume and Heisenberg's Principle of Indeterminacy).<BR>The same can be said of his view on mankind, which was highly influenced by Darwin and Schopenhauer: 'The essence of man is his egoism that we all inherit from that remote energy which in the unplumbed past first set the ball rolling'; or 'So long as some are strong and some are weak, the weak will be driven to the wall'.<br />Having read a lot of philosophy, he was upset by the low standard of the philosophy of his days, which dodged for him fundamental problems, like evil (war).<br />The author has sometimes been characterized as cynical (e.g. for his best novel 'Of human bondage'). He shows his cynicism again in this book: on the English, 'They are not an amorous race. They are of course sufficiently sexual for the purpose of reproducing their species, but they cannot control the instinctive feeling that the sexual act is disgusting.'<BR>Or his virulent atheism: 'God is not so reasonable. He promises rewards to those who believe in him and threatens with horrible punishment those who do not. For my part I cannot believe in a God who is angry with me because I do not believe in him'.<br />His analysis of the writer (not one but many men), the novel and theatre is highly modern. It could easily be applied on TV plays today.<br />This is a sincere, still topical and highly recommendable book.	2003-07-04

She jumps from lover to music to drugs in an unending circle, looking for some happiness.<br />This novel is a kind of diary but, unfortunately, it has no plot. As a matter of fact, the author added a number of scenes to the book after the first edition. It should be easy to add another hundred pages.<BR>Into the bargain, it is a magnified example of what an author should not do: dozens of pages of expressions of her emotions. But that is not the aim of art (writing). A writer should arouse the interest and the emotions of the reader, not express his own. After a few chapters this novel becomes boring. One litany of lamentations is enough.<BR>One can feel sorry for her, but one does the same when one sees real junkies in the street.<br />By the way, this subject had already been better covered in the West (W.S.

Bryan Magee has the marvellous power to arouse the interest of the reader in his books. He does it again in this one on Schopenhauer.<br />He explains clearly the place and the importance of Schopenhauer in the history of philosophy, the strenght and modernity of his ideas, and his deep influence on later philosophers and artists. He also criticizes vigorously some aspects of his work and life.<br />Magee shows that Schopenhauer built his worldview on the transcendental idealism of Kant. But he went further by describing the real nature of Kant's 'thing in itself' (the noumenon), which he called rather unfortunately the 'will'. For Schopenhauer, the entire world of phenomena in time and space, internally connected by causality, is the self-objectivation of an impersonal, timelessly active will. It is an unassuageable striving, which means continued dissatisfaction for the individual.<BR>Schopenhauer noticed a flaw in Kant's reasoning that we could only access to the 'thing in itself' through our sensory and intellectual apparatus. We know one material 'thing in itself' subjectively: our own body.<br />The idea of the 'will' is very modern, because it anticipated Darwin's evolutionism, Freud's unconsciousness and Einstein's holism (everything is energy).<br />Magee explains magisterially all aspects of Schopenhauer's penetrating worldview, like the defective intellect of mankind, because intelligence is only a late and superficial evolutionary differentiation, developed for the promotion of animal survival.<BR>His investigation of human behaviour is based on what people do in fact, not on what they 'ought to do'. His conclusion was that what traditionally had been considered moral behaviour turned out to be self-interest. <BR>For Schopenhauer, art is not an expression of emotion, but an attempt to convey an insight into the true nature of things. It must have its origin in direct perception, not in concepts.<BR>Magee stresses rightly that Schopenhauer was one of thefew philosophers who integrated sex in his speculations. For him, sex is the 'very process whereby the will to live achieves life. The urge towards it is the most powerful of the will's demands, next only to the brute survival of what already exists'.<BR>He shows also his virulent atheism ('As ultima ratio theologorum we find among many nations the stake'), his misogyny and his interest in Buddhism.<br />His criticism of Schopenhauer is also very important and to the point.<BR>Schopenhauer denies mankind free will. But if there is no free will, there is no morality.<BR>More importantly, he notices that Schopenhauer didn't live a life of someone who believed in a world of only unrelieved pessimism, dominated by the inherently evil metaphysical will. His life contradicted a part of his philosophy!<br />This very rich book contains also excellent explanations of the philosophy of Fichte, Schelling, Vaihinger and Frege, as well as brilliant demonstrations of the influence of Schopenhauer on Nietzsche and Wittgenstein (the Tractatus).<BR>Magee gives us also a very stark argument against solipsism.<br />The one point on which I disagree with Magee is the following comment: 'This is not the same as to say that these material objects are fully and completely us: that is another matter.' (p. 121)<br />This sometimes ferociously driven apologia pro Schopenhauer (and Kant) is the best possible presentation of a philosopher. Magee convinced me to read Schopenhauer's main work. I didn't do it until now, because I was influenced by G. Lukacs.<BR>A book not to be missed.	2003-07-02

Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen argues most convincingly that people need first and most freedom. Freedom is the necessary basis from which poverty, famine, violation of elementary political, social and economical liberties, the protection of the environment and the subordination of women can be dealt with. Freedom means also a change in mentality: human beings should not be considered as patients but as actors.<BR>Real development is removal of intolerance and lack of freedom (opportunities for everyone, a free market, free elections).<br />His critic of the theorem of Lee (Singapore's ruler Lee Kuan Yew) is essential. For Lee, people don't need first democracy, but economic growth instead. For Sen, the strengthening of the democratic system is a conditio sine qua non for the development process. Free elections will generate economic growth and more freedom, because otherwise the men in power will not be re-elected.<br />But Amartya Sen argues also rightly that, besides the free market, there must be some basic public goods: education, medical aid, social security and a solid legal system (against corruption). He also fustigates against investment in military goods instead of in those basic public services.<br />He stigmatizes communism as a new form of feudalism.<br />This book contains also excellent comments and/or criticism on Pareto, Rawls, Hayek, Arrow, Bentham and Nozick.<br />The only point I don't agree with is his rosy picture of the Japanese economic and social system (see K. van Wolferen, A. Nothomb's 'Fear and Trembling' or A. Sergeant's 'The old Sow in the Back Room').<br />This book is the work of a true humanist with a very broad intellectual horizon. An essential read.	2003-06-28

This is a masterful biography, but one need to have a profound knowledge of higher mathematics and a basic one in physics to fully understand it.    Walter Moore shows that Schrödinger's life and thought was at least controversial.    Life  Schrödinger's personal itinerary is exemplary for the 20th century. He was born in a comfortable upper-middle class, but his parents lost their savings in the German inflation after WW I. The result was famine and diseases. It marked the rest of his life. As a young man he was confronted with unemployment and nearly left physics for financial reasons!  He found a decent job only at the age of 34. Even after winning the Nobel Prize he was still confronted with 'pension' problems.    Science  Walter Moore gives us a magisterial and detailed analysis of the scientific discoveries of ES, from his humble beginnings to the elaboration of the quantum wave function and after.  It shows that ES was above all a mathematical genius and a not so brilliant experimenter.  ES remained all his life opposed to the complemantary (particle/wave) interpretation of quantum mechanics (the 'Kopenhagen oracle' for ES). For him, there were only waves!    Sex  Beside science, sex was the principal occupation of his life, with all combinations imaginable. He lived a ménage à trois and sometimes à quatre, but still fell in love with other women, also with very young ones for he had a Lolita complex. He could without doubt have been accused of paedophilia.  But his intense love affairs stimulated highly his scientific creativity.  One can only wonder if his 'wild' behaviour and negative view of bourgeois marriage were not fundamentally influenced by the fact that he couldn't marry his first true love, because her family found that he was too poor!    Politics  He had a deep contempt for the governing classes (politicians, clergy) who 'enslave men by violence and use the religious desire of many people to promote superstition to rule over the dispossessed'. He also distrusted democracy!    Philosophical world view  This is certainly one of the strangest aspects of his thoughts.  He was convinced that physics provided absolutely no answers to philosophical questions (e. g. free will). All his life he remained, like Einstein, an adept of determinism.  His philosophical views and ethical principles were completely dissociated from his real life!  As an adept of the Vedanta, he believed the Buddhist wisdom that a thing could be both A and non-A (horribile dictu)!  He was also heavily influenced by the philosophy of Schopenhauer.    This work gives excellent explanations of the Vedanta, and the philosophy of Mach and Schopenhauer.  It contains a very painful paragraph on Heidegger.    I see only one minus point: the author doesn't give Bohr's pertinent response to the EPR-article against the Copenhagen interpretation of qm.    This is a brilliant book and certainly the definitive biography of Schrödinger. It is by no means a hagiography and doesn't dodge some 'weird' aspects of Schrödinger's life.  Not to be missed.	2003-06-20

So is the First Amendment protection not valid for private-sector employees. They can be fired for their political views. Also, foreigners can be denied a visit to the US for ideological reasons.<BR>On another level: Bill Clinton, like Jimmy Carter, is a member of the Bilderberg group.<br />I have nevertheless reservations for some extreme viewpoints of the author.<BR>I agree with him that the market is not free, but more or less rigged by oligopolies. But I don't agree with him on his totally anti-market stance. Only, the oligopolies should be broken.<BR>I am equally not against transnational companies. On the contrary, I agree with Susan Strange that these companies are one of the major sources of higher living standards in the world, through their delocations, investments and technology transfers. I agree that this is (was) in their own interest, but the effect is the same (Adam Smith revisited).<BR>I am also not against GATT. It should be changed from within. We need more open markets for all countries and all players.<br />As other writers (Domhoff, Vidal) stated: it will be very difficult to change the actual situation.

Peter Dale Scott poses essential questions and his investigations lead to very disturbing answers.<br />He uses the JFK assassination as a paradigm for the revelation and understanding of the real powers in the US.<br />With parallels to 3 other political scandals (MacCarthyism, Watergate, Contragate) he shows that there are deep continuities in the US political system. He arrives at the most alarming conclusion that the US power system is intrinsically vicious, violent and murderous and that conspiracies form an essential part of it.<br />He shows convincingly that the real powers in the US lay in a symbiosis of public government, organized crime and private wealth.<br />Most diabolic are the FBI (lead by the insidious Edgar J. Hoover) and the CIA, which are both responsible for the ruthless destruction of opponents and dissidents without legal or moral restraint.<br />This book gives an appalling picture of the Agency, fighting for the justification of its existence and its resources by prolonging the Cold War. It infiltrated the media in order to preach its Gospel. It used organized crime and drug traffickers as means for its ends.<br />Very revealing also is the fact that 20 percent of the shares of General Dynamics were in the hands of the mob.<br />His final analysis is devastating: 'how far our office-holders, including our Presidents, have been reduced to the status of clients, dispensable when the more enduring patronage is withdrawn?' and 'To what extent has our visible political establishment become one regulated by forces operating outside the constitutional process?'<br />After reading this book, I confess that posing these questions is answering them.<br />A provocative, dark and disturbing book.<br />A must read.	2003-06-18

If the documents released in this book are not fakes, then it is most alarming that it didn't get more public attention, because it is an official nuclear bomb.<br />In fact, it proves that JFK was killed by the CIA with knowledge of other high placed persons and authorities.<br />Why this assassination? It was a killing for survival. JFK planned to break-up the Agency and 'scatter it to the winds'.<br />The whole book is a frontal attack on the CIA, written with anger and profound disgust. Disgust with the enormous waste of money on an incompetent Agency (it couldn't prevent the September 11 attack), on its deep implication in drug trafficking, its disastrous analyses, its unending catalogue of instigations of rebellion and civil wars, of terrorism and assassinations. And the final result: the world turned against the US.<br />This book contains other very revealing facts.<br />The CIA helped the OAS in France in an attempt to kill President De Gaulle.<br />The JFK gunmen were French citizens. One of them Lucien Sarti, who escaped to Mexico and was murdered there?<br />We know already from other sources that JFK was not a saint, but that 'In Chicago even the death were said to have voted, again, early and often' (p.58) was news for me.<br />This book confirms the thesis of Peter Dale Scott's 'Deep Politics', which suggested that the thugs-of-war behind the crime were to be found in the US power system, a symbiosis of public government, organized crime and private wealth.<br />This book is a very disturbing analysis of one of the boldest, darkest and most important assassinations of all time. It shows that the world is only governed by the elected politicians if they carry out the policies of the real powerful.<br />A must read.	2003-06-18

This is without a shadow of a doubt a very important book, based on massive field research.<br />As prof. Betzig states: this is a book about how things really are: the end of human life is its reproduction, and positions of strength are exploited to this end. Power (bluntly, the ability to kill subjects for trivial or no cause) is essential in the resolution of conflicts of interest to the advantage of those who hold power.<br />This work demonstrates profusely that self-interest and its corroborations (nepotism, corruption ...) reign mightily in all societies. It answers most clearly why power corrupts. It explains the near universality of despotic governments in hierarchal societies, but also why this kind of government still exists (open and bare, or hidden) everywhere in the world today.<br />This book has some very important victims: J.J. Rousseau (general will) and Hegel (the moral law) are plainly brushed off: 'law' is not a product of a social contract or of the State, but 'rights and obligations coincide with relative status'. The powerful dictate(d) the laws.<BR>A third victim is Marx with his emphasis on production and not reproduction, and his prescription of a socialist(!) revolution.<BR>Another victim is G. Becker (partly): the family is not fundamentally an economic unit, because men are essentially concerned with the fidelity of their wives.<br />Why did, for prof. Betzig, the situation become less despotic in modern states? Because people in power have been forced to make concessions to attract mercenaries, craftsmen, defense specialists ... But these people are still used directly or indirectly to contribute to the reproductive efforts of men in power.<br />This is a formidable modern book. As the author bluntly states: one must first comprehend the basics, before one can implement measures for change.<br />This small book shows magisterially the depth and enormous power of the Darwinian thought.<BR>An essential read.	2003-06-17

Michael Parenti's comments on the September 11 catastrophe are to the point: it was a horrendous shock for everybody and certainly for Main Street, chloroformed by the media's rosy picture of the state of the Union.<br />In a small book like this one, the author could not develop the deeper reasons, which, he beliefs, are behind this horrible attack and why the US is so hated in certain parts of the world: the US military interventions and the military aid to protect the various ruling oligarchs and multinational corporate investors, to destroy reformist movements, labour unions, peasant organizations, democratically elected reformist governments.<BR>In a nutshell: the imperialist goals of the US to create a global hegemony (a world of client states).<br />Although his analyses are globally right, he should have paid more attention to the fact that the attacks were carried out by Muslim fundamentalists, who were partially (the Taliban) financed by the US.<br />Like Gore Vidal, he fulminates rightly against the massive US defence budget, the biased media, monopolistic free trade, big money corporate capitalism, religion laced with violence and intolerance and environmental damage.<br />This is a harsh, but much needed, pamphlet, because it lays bare some undeniable facts, which are crucial for world politics.<BR>Not to be missed.	2003-05-15

Although the authors recognize that there is still awfully much tot do, their analyses and hypotheses are a big step forward in our understanding of consciousness.<BR>It is certainly not an easy book. One should have a basic knowledge of the constitution and the working of the brain.<BR>I, personally, would have liked more concrete examples, like those for instance in the book of C.J. Lumsden and E.O. Wilson 'Promethean Fire'.<br />This book doesn't explain how consciousness arises, but what it is (properties) and how it works.<BR>Consciousness is not a thing or a property, but a process (of neural interactions).<BR>One of the reviewers here compares consciousness to a car. But a car is a thing, not a process.<BR>Consciousness is a private, integrated, coherent, differentiated, informative, continually changing process.<BR>The authors make also the opportune distinction between primary (animal, unconscious) and higher-order consciousness (the ability to be conscious of being conscious).<br />Crucial for the authors are re-entrant interactions, degeneracy (recategorical memory), and a part of the brain 'the dynamic core' (a subset of neuronal groups responsible for consciousness).<BR>The dynamic core provides then a rationale for distinguishing conscious processes from unconscious ones (e.g. the circuits that regulate blood pressure).<br />This book shows clearly that the brain is not a computer and that it doesn't work as a computer program or algorithm.<BR>It has also very important philisophical consequences, which the authors summarize as follows: being is prior to describing, selection is prior to logic and doing is prior to understanding.<br />I also fully agree with the authors that Darwin's theory is the most ideologically significant scientific theory ever written.<br />Although this book is rather technical, it should not be missed by those interested in the real nature of the conscious process.<br />I should also recommend the work of V. Ramachandran 'Ghosts in the Brain', for its multiple examples of (un)conscious behaviour and its philosphical implications (the body/mind problem).	2003-05-12

Gore Vidal unveils superbly the real interests behind the recent US foreign policy: follow the oil.<BR>As a proof, one should look at the number of former oil company employees in the US and also in the Afghan government.<br />His analysis of the US domestic situation is truly severe: the many are hijacked by the few, who own the corporations, which themselves control the media (directly or indirectly through their advertising expenses). Into the bargain, the few are laying their hands on a massive part (51%) of the US discretionary budget via military expenses and their corollary, defense contracts with fat margins. Gore Vidal rightly speaks of a militarized economy.<br />While his domestic analysis is harsh, his foreign policy analysis is tragic: the US, after World War II, intervened through more than 250 military strikes in the policy of other countries, mostly against democratically elected governments (Vidal's example: president Arbenz in Guatemala).<br />Gore Vidal has real propositions for fundamental changes: break-up of the oligopolies, devolution or a new constitutional convention(!), but for me, those will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to realize.<br />This small book contains still more very interesting and important items.<BR>If you want to know more about Pearl Harbor, about Bush and Cheney as draft dodgers, or cynical comments of the WSJ about the Taliban (how the media follow the oil), you should read this much needed book.	2003-05-10

This small book tells the story of the USIA (the US Information Agency), a government unit.  This institution was created with very good intentions (increase mutual understanding between people), but was diverted from its original goal and streamlined as a propaganda machine to promote the US economic system and business interests.    The author rightly stigmatizes harshly the democratic deficit in the US: a media monopoly, a political duopoly ruled by big business and big money, and a plutocracy which dominates without control public welfare, public lands, public airwaves and the pension trusts.  Prof. Snow proposes a seven point plan to restore true democracy, but the implementation will be extremely difficult, if not impossible.    This book should be read as a classic example of how particular interest groups take control of a public institution and turn it into a pro-private interests mouthpiece.

The home comers couldn't disguise it, for they were infected by VD's.<br />Travel reflected and still reflects economic power and 'colonialist' superiority.<BR>For the affluent who could afford it, Italy (and also Africa) was the main pleasure ground for women travellers; Paris and the Mediterranean countries (Algeria) for men. Their main goal was 'sex with the young', also the very young (paedophilia).<br />Travel was and is an escape. Now, an escape out of stress. In the former centuries an escape out of the home situation: for women, the subordination; for men, lack of sexual liberty and condemnation of homosexuality.<br />I recommend this book because it treats a modern subject without dodging an often disguised but essential part of it.	2003-04-29

The goal of this book is dramatically important: combine the computational theory of the mind and the theory of the natural replicators. After all, the mind is designed to attain a maximum number of copies of the genes that created it. In a nutshell: mind and evolution.<br />\\"The mind is a neural computer, fitted by natural selection with combinatorial algorithms for causal and probabilistic reasoning ... It is driven by goal states that served biological fitness in ancestral environments, such as food, sex, safety, parenthood, friendship, status, and knowledge.\\" (p.524)<br />Does Prof. Pinker achieve this goal?<br />He clearly states from the beginning that his theory is only a model and that he has absolutely no intention to explain how the brain 'really' works.<br />But, he is immediately confronted with the 'subject or qualia problem': the fact that consciousness is a personal experience and that other people have absolutely no notion of, for instance, the pain someone else feels.<br />The solution for Prof. Pinker is the one proposed by D. Dennett: sentient experiences are cognitive illusions.<br />'Once we have isolated the computational and neurological correlates of access-consciousness, there is nothing left to explain.(p.147)<br />It is a kind of solution called in psychology 'behaviourism' (no matter what the guy feels or thinks, if only his behaviour is fine).<br />It is clear that the behaviour of somebody is totally different from the pain he feels, although both will be correlated.<br />Into the bargain, G. Edelman, V. Ramachandran, J.R. Searle and others demonstrated without a shadow of a doubt that the brain doesn't work like a computer.<br />Prof. Pinker gives good examples of how the brain could process information and how thinking could be explained as a kind of computation.<br />But ultimately he has to throw in the towel and admits himself \\"perhaps we cannot solve conundrums like free will and sentience.\\" (p.561)<br />So why should this book be read? Not for the 'mind' content, but for the 'evolution' part.<br />It treats very important and interesting items like: Why do we advertise emotions on our face? Why is the work of Margaret Mead a real scam? Why is Darwin's theory so progressive? Why sex? Why is religion a technique for success?

This book is basically vested on Hegel and thymos (search for recognition).<br />Hegel's theories are fundamentally wrong and thymos is not an essential human necessity.<br />As Bertrand Russell explains in his 'Unpopular Essays': 'Hegel's philosophy is so odd that one would not accept him to be able to get sane men to accept it ... I was cured ... by discovering that everything he said on the philosophy of mathematics was plain nonsense.'<br />Nietzsche said that whoever got Hegelitis would never be cured.<br />Russell was cured, Fukuyama not.<br />By vesting his theory on thymos, Fukuyama's comments fail to catch time and again essential facts on the individual, social and international level. The outcome of his reasonings are complete nonsense.<br />Hereafter some examples.<br />To get his Hegelian system working, he has to assume that human nature 'changed over time'(p. 63). I wonder if the selfish genes did the same.<br />'Imperialism ... arises directly out of the aristocratic master's desire to be recognized as superior - his megalothymia.' (p.259)<br />This is plain nonsense. Imperialism is about political / economical power to subject other people in order to get slaves, streams of dividends, territories ... depending on the period and/or the countries.<br />'The desire for religious mastery - that is, the recognition of one's own gods and idols by other peoples - ... is not an undifferentiated struggle for power ... but the struggle for recognition.' (p.259)<br />This is plain nonsense. Religious wars for mastery (were) are about power, territory and capital. E.g. 'A world lit by fire' by W. Manchester: by adhering to Luther, the taxpayers didn't have to pay the compulsory indulgences to the Pope.<br />'The willingness to risk one's life for pure prestige plays such an important role in Hegel's account of history.' (p.150)<br />For Hegel yes, but not for me. All noblemen fought one another with mercenaries (see the parody on the Swiss in Utopia by Thomas More, or E. Luttwak). No soldier will ever put his life in danger. However the nobility used the argument of the 'risk of their life for the defense of the country' in order to get a tax exempt status.<br />One of the crucial factors for the outbreak of the first World war was, for Fykuyama, the fact ' that many European publics simply wanted war because they were fed up with the dullness and lack of community in civilian life.' (p.331)<br />I doubt if firmly. But I am sure that one of the crucial factors was the fact that the Kaiser felt that his empire was threatened. He didn't fight (he had no thymos), but fled his country at the end of the war as a thief in the night. (Stefan Zweig: The World of Yesterday).<br />His final thesis that liberalism vanquished nationalism ( = the End of History) is an illusion. Nationalism (the survival of the nation) will always be stronger than liberalism for it serves the essential human characteristic of survival (of the genes).<br />For me, this book is a classic example of what Jean Fourasti&eacute; called a 'conceptual delirium'.<br />But more importantly, the author is on the side of war and not of peace. As another great philosopher stated 'Hegel's war of nations became Marx's war of classes and Hitler's war of races', a truly disastrous opinion with deadly intellectual and physical consequences.<br />N.B. In the 'Assembly of Women' by Aristophanes, the assembly doesn't force handsome boys to marry ugly women, but forces handsome boys to have sex with older women before they could marry the girl of their choice.

Besides his excellent explanations of 'past evolutions' and the 'evolution at work', the author discusses some essential religious, moral and scientific items.<br />With bees and ants as examples, Prof. Williams explains clearly that the Darwinist evolution is about genes, not about living beings. He also discusses the advantage of sex and aging for a successful gene reproduction.<BR>Other important remarks are, firstly, the fact that the brain erupted only to propel genetic success, not to investigate philosophical or other problems. Secondly, there is a probable discrepancy between adaptations dated from the Stone Age and our actual living conditions, which could be at the origin of actual defects (e. g. myopia) or inadaptations.<br />But the more important items lay on a different level.<BR>On the religious front, Prof. Williams attacks righteously the God-is-good gospel. Living beings on earth have only one purpose: the success of their own genes. This brings us to a second very important point: natural selection, albeit stupid, is a story of 'unending arms races, slaughter and sufferings'. It is a law of nature and its immorality has to be accepted and, at least, to be thought about.<br />On the scientific front, the author castigates what he calls domain (field) confusion: the mingling of physics, morality, mind and data processing. <BR>A frequent example is the mixing of the biological (the working of the brain) and the data processing fields.<BR>But more important is the mix up of religion and biology. Prof. Williams declares courageously that it is biologically speaking untenable to declare that a human being exists from the moment of conception. Only a full-term baby is that.<br />This book attacks essential everyday problems and is a must read.	2003-01-21

This is a very important book.<BR>It proves convincingly that consciousness is a matter of ... matter (the biological matter of the brain) and that it is the outcome of a long history of biological adaptations.<br />It also proves that the mind is not a computer or a Turing machine, that human language is not a computer language and that physics is not sufficient to explain its working. The morphology of the brain goes deep, but not as deep as to attain the quantum level.<BR>On the contrary, Edelman explains clearly that the mind is a process that operates in a 4 dimensional world; that it doesn't have a perfect memory or doesn't order events or objects logically. It is subject to mutation in order to select and to adapt and creates itself aspects of the reality by cultural and language interaction. Into the bargain, the biological structure of the brain is different for every individual.<br />Edelman's theory has also far reaching philosophical implications. It is the death of essentialism (there are no 'essences', only populations with different individuals) and of idealism (the world was there before the mind).<br />Is Edelman's TNGS (theory of neural group selection) the end of the story? Absolutely not. It is only the beginning. It forms the basis for further investigations. But it clearly indicates which way to follow and which ways not.<br />I have only one reservation: Edelman's nearly unconditional admiration for Freud.<br />This is an essential read.	2003-01-21

This book covers one of the essential aspects of the murder of President Kennedy: the Mafia and his executioner Jack Ruby.<BR>It is a thorough investigation: David E. Scheim went as far as analyzing all telephone calls by Ruby before the assassination.<br />The author gives us a most credible explanation of how the Mafia could benefit and did after the murder. More, he draws a disturbing portrait of how the Mafia penetrated the highest power ranks in the U.S. and how it could influence the life of every U.S. citizen.<BR>He castigates the Warren Report as a shameful misjudgment.<br />This book is a must read.

This work is certainly one of the best investigations into the murder of President Kennedy.<BR>It is a new version of his former book 'Conspiracy'.<br />Although the author admits that he could not find the ultimate truth, he believes that Lee Harvey Oswald was framed by an alliance of anti-Castro militants, the Mafia and members of the CIA. He could not find out if or not Oswald was a low level CIA agent himself. The author believes however that Oswald was used by U.S. intelligence without his knowledge. <br />The author also proves convincingly that the version of the killing proclaimed by the Warren Commission is untenable.<br />This book is a real thriller about a diabolic masterstroke. The real protagonists behind the curtain could load all the suspicions on one person, whom they then ordered to be killed. The whole plot was buried by the Warren Commission.<br />A masterly investigation.	2003-01-11

Very slow and far too long book based on a few crucial experiments or diseases: the color-phi-phenomenon of Koler, the experiments of Libet and Multiple Personality Disorder.<br />Half of the book is spent to reject the Cartesian model of an exact location of consciousness in the brain and to replace it by a multiple version model.<BR>The other part is an explanation of consciousness in terms of a self-developing computer programme that organizes the brain's activity.<BR>Language plays, for the author, a great part in the structuring of the human mind.<br />Roger Penrose (The Emperor's New Mind) from a physical point of view and Gerald Edelman (Bright Air, Brilliant Fire) from a biological point of view proved for me convincingly that the brain is not a computer and that its action cannot be compared with a computer programme. Trying to explain the working of the brain or of consciousness in this way is for me a dead end.<br />On the other hand, it is possible that language structures the mind, but before that, the mind had to permit the coming into existence of language (the mind was there before language). There is a reciprocal adaptation.<BR>The all importance of language foreces the author to state that without natural language the mind of the deaf-and-thumb is terribly limited. This is not true, for they can learn to speak with their hands.<br />I agree with the author's definition of the (biological) self and also with his statement that the brain was in the first place developed to do other activities (to choose between fight or flee...) than read and write.<br />Although I still learned a lot by reading this book, I cannot recommend it. <br />N.B. 'L'acte gratuit' is an element of the philosophy of Bergson, not of Sartre or Gide. On the contrary, Gide ridicules it in 'Les Caves du Vatican', where a commuter pushes another commuter out of a running train as an ... 'acte gratuit'.	2003-01-10

Davies' books, but I found that this one had not the same high standard as his other books. Some chapters were boring and gave the impression that they were written purely to expand the volume of this work.<br />But as always, he explains clearly and understandably his subject, like such important items as the opposite direction of time's arrow in thermodynamics (downhill) and in the Darwinist evolution(uphill), or the disappearance of time in quantum mechanics.<br />Remarkably, one of the main themes of his more compelling and recommendable book 'The 5th Miracle' is already announced here: \\"Many scientists are adamant that the 'concretization' of quantum reality has nothing whatever to do with the mind, others maintain that the mystery of the 'collapse' (of the wave) and the mystery of consciousness are intimately bound up with each other.\\" (p. 278)<br />I prefer the books written by G.

Paul Davies gives in an easy understandable vocabulary his vision on different theories about the origin of life on earth (panspermia, Martian meteorites, primordial soups ...).<BR>An important point mentioned in this book is that probably the first terrestrial organisms lived deep underground in geothermally heated rocks.<br />But there is more controversial material. After searching in vain for God's place in physics (The Mind of God), prof. Davies looks now for an evolutionary goal as an alternative for the 'nihilistic philosophy of the pointless universe'. This goal is life and consciousness, created by a self-organizing and self-complexifying universe. A universe in which the emergence of thinking beings is a fundamental and integral part of the overall scheme of things.&quot; (p. 272-3)<br />The main motor behind this evolution should be a blend of molecular Darwinism and the 'law' of organizational complexity, a mix of the second law of thermodynamics, physics, computation and chemistry.<BR>Paul Davies is not sure how it could work, but he states: &quot;the atom treated as a particle corresponds to hardware. When a quantum measurement is made, the wave &quot;collapses&quot; ... But this in turn affects the subsequent behaviour of the particle. There is thus a sort of hardware-software entanglement in quantum mechanics ... Could some sort of quantum-organizing process be just what is needed to explain the origin of informational macromolecules?&quot; (p. 260-1)<br />This is a very bold speculation. But, for me, it is too beautiful to be true. <BR>Gerald M. Edelman in his book 'Bright Air, Brilliant Fire' convinced me that the origin of consciousness doesn't lay on the quantum but on the biological level (biochemical processes). Secondly, I believe that Gould and Dawkins are right and that we live in a pointless universe. Thirdly, Roger Penrose convinced me that trying to present the mind as a computer is a dead end.<br />Even if you don't agree with all his propositions, you should read this compelling book, which flows like a dazzling waterfall.	2003-01-07

Paul Davies tries to answer some essential questions: is there extraterrestrial life (ET)? What would happen if we discover it? What would be the character of that life? Would it be conscious?<BR>His answer is: the most plausible outcome of conservative (!) assumptions implies that there are an infinite number (not more than that) of identical creatures in the universe.<br />An important consequence of the discovery of ET could be the undermining of the Neo-Darwinist theory that life and consciousness are totally arbitrary emerging phenomena. It could indicate that there is a progressive evolutionary trend in the universe.<BR>In fact, Paul Davies sees it already on our planet and calls it the law of increasing complexity. This increasing complexity creates the brain and consciousness. For consciousness, for him, is a basic characteristic of the universe.<br />But why or how does consciousness emerge? As with other authors who tackled this question, Paul Davies gives no answer.<br />This book is one long supposition. As long as we don't discover or get in contact with ET, all his questions will stay unanswered.<br />This book reads like a thriller. Not be missed.	2003-01-04

What is superspace? What is an infinite-dimensional superworld?<BR>Until he arrives at the ultimate one: why do we find ourselves living in this particular universe rather than one of the myriad others?

Paul Davies gives us brilliant speculative descriptions of different possibilities of the end of the universe. But as one of the former reviewers states, the latest scientific data indicate that the universe will continue to expand forever. So, part of this book is obsolete.<br />I believe that the author is also too optimistic about the fate of mankind in the universe after the dying of the sun. If mankind doesn't commit suicide, he predicts not less than a colonization of the entire Milky Way.<br />As always with Paul Davies, the different stories are told in a clear and easily comprehensible vocabulary.

Gore Vidal is hard hitting and puts the facts straight.<BR>The US is governed by the few, who are chloroforming the many through their control of the media. As a truly brilliant quotation of David Hume states: 'as force is always on the side of the governed, the governors have nothing to support them but opinion'.<BR>The few for him are an emanation of monotheism, which can only be truly served by totalitarianism. The few keep also control by spending a big part of the real US budget on National Security (the military-industrial complex). For what? To support regimes which deny freedom, democracy and human rights to their own people.<br />This situation is deeply hurting Gore Vidal, who above all loves freedom and telling the truth: 'should the few persist in their efforts to dominate the private lives of the many, I recommend force as a means of changing their minds'. (p.52)<br />I agree with the above mentioned analyses of Gore Vidal, but I strongly disagree with the title of this book.<br />Far from declining and falling, the US Empire is still a reigning world superpower and actually the only one.<BR>The two main causes Gore Vidal cites for the fall are not there anymore. The Japanese economy imploded and is still imploding, and the US national budget is in a far better shape now than ten years ago.<BR>I see at the horizon one big superpower emerging, on which the US high tech industry is already highly dependent: China. With a market of 1.3 billion people and a well educated population, China cannot loose if it plays it cleverly. It is doing it, for I saw it this year.<br />This book is a must read for everyone interested in US and world politics.	2002-12-25

In his at first sight 'light-hearted' style, Milan Kundera tackles profound questions. In this book: why want people to forget the past? Why do people forget the past? Why want and try people that other people forget the(ir) past? His answer: to control the future. And why do people want to control the future: to rewrite the past.<BR>For the struggle of mankind against the powerful is the struggle of the mind against forgetting.<br />The political/social and/or religious powerful are obsessed by the political or moral past. Christianity is obsessed by the sexual past (paradisiac sexuality) of mankind. In the countries of Eastern Europe, politicians are obsessed by their collaborationist past. If they can't rewrite the past, they have no future.<br />This book is brilliantly composed along those themes. As Milan Kundera himself states: as 'Variations on a Theme' by Beethoven: every part with different characters, situations, surroundings ...<br />A masterpiece.	2002-12-24

I totally agree with Edward Luttwak's plain talk: today's capitalism with its managing for the short time, profits the happy few, but is a disaster for the many: abrupt mass firings, disruption of individual lives, of families, of communities and even of entire regions, insecurity of the middle classes.<br />Fortunately, he believes that turbo capitalism will pass, but, for me, not immediately.<BR>For the reasons, read for instance the excellent books on US politics by Gore Vidal.<br />One of Luttwak's cures to reverse the actual situation is control by the government, but if the government is controlled by the few (private corporations and their main individual shareholders), the proceeds of capitalismn will continue to flow to the few.<br />As a matter of fact, he is severe for the actual governmental policies, like monetarism (it devalues labor rather than money); like the conversion of all institutions - hospitals etc. - into profit-maximizing corporations, or the hypocritical war on drugs. <BR>I quote: \\"Even the fanciest illegal substances hardly make a dent in the budget of many users, some of whom are multi-millionaires ... The ruined drug addict on his way to a penniless death in a sordid alley is mostly myth: if it were not so ... Colombian drug lords would have to be content with tenements and bicycles instead of palatial mansions and executive jets.\\" (p.210)<br />His conclusion is obvious: what is needed is a government that governs for the many and distributes more equally than now the proceeds of capitalism over the whole population, not only through wages, but also through better social welfare.<BR>But this is only possible via the democratic process.<br />This book contains also excellent analyses of, among others, the causes of World War I, mercantilism or the situation in Russia after the fall of the Berlin wall.<br />An important work.

He states for instance that fewer than 3 percent of the flowering plants of the world have been examined for alkoloids and that many species are at risk.<br />Prof. Wilson illustrates very forcefully the impact of biodiversity by giving numerous examples from the medical, pharmaceutical, energy and agricultural field with colossal numbers in $ for actual applications.<BR>To give one example: 'the rosy periwinkle of Madagascar produces two alkaloids that cure most victims of two of the deadliest of cancers, Hodgkin's disease and acute lymphocytic leukaemia.

This book is in fact a plea for a 'lender of last resort' in case of financial crises, and also an attack on monetarism.<br />&quot;A monetarist view of the matter - that mania and panic would be avoided if only the supply of money were stabilized at some fixed quantity, or at a regular growing level - is rejected.&quot; (p.6)<br />&quot;The Chicago School of monetarism assumes that authorities are universally stupid and the market always intelligent. In the panics we are examining, this uneven distribution of intelligence cannot be tested against crisis management because authorities and leading figures in the marketplace both exert themselves in the same direction: to intervene in one way or another, in order to halt the spread of falling prices, bankruptcy, and bank failure.&quot; (p.158)<br />Kindleberger proves that authorities aren't always that stupid: see the Marshall Plan after WW II.<br />For the lender of last resort, Kindleberger remarks: &quot;The historical record suggests the leading financial centre of the world, often assisted by other countries.&quot; (p.201)<br />This is a fascinating study covering 500 years of economic history and crises. This book not only gives an objective view on the different crashes, but also tries to extract necessary lessons from them.<br />A must for every economist and for the layman.	2002-12-09

When this novel was published before World War II, it was immediately recognized as an attack on Hitler and the Nazi party. This was rightly so.

Because in these dangerous circumstances the real masters, the real free can prove unmistakably who they are: courageous, natural leaders, morally and physically free men.<BR>Jnger is a formidable writer.

'Flowers in the shade' is a typical Kafu story (nearly all his novels are translated in French) about an unlicensed prostitute in the red light district of Tokyo before WW II.<BR>The main character O-Chiyo, falls in the hands of a pimp, Jukichi, but is shameless, happy and satisfied with her amoral life: she survives. In a report in a journal about a police razzia she learns that her daughter was caught. She has the same profession as her mother.<br />Kafu is a writer about moods, about the sentiments of his characters: \\"The thought that his woman was occasionally intimate with other men gave rise to various fantasies and violently aroused Jukichi's sexual desires. ...<BR>As for O-Chiy, knowing that she had her husband's open permission not only removed any shame from her heart but, since she was working for Jukichi's sake, any feelings of shyness.\\" (p.188)<BR>Kafu's stories have no plot, no real action, but the psychological picture or progression is captivating.<br />'During the rains' is not typical for Kafu.

The authors are harsh for today's US economists, because they have lost contact with the social reality: \\"the extraordinary combination of arrogance and innocence with which mainstream economics has approached the problems of a nation that had experienced twenty years of declining real wages, forty percent of whose children live in \\"absolute\\" poverty, and which endured an unprecedented erosion of health, vacation, and pension benefits. The commitment to full employment legislated in 1946 has been \\"honored\\" in these socially destructive years ... by redefining \\"full\\" employment as a higher level of unemployment.\\"(p.6)<BR>The solution of the authors is government intervention in the economy and a re-evaluation of the public sector, although they recognize that Keynesianism was and is not perfect: it was unable to present a coherent theory of inflation; it failed to include a concept of stagflation; and its treatment of the money supply could lead to inflation.<BR>But in fact, the US government intervenes already heavily in the economy, but for the authors not in the right sector: defence.<br />This book, written in 1995, contains already the central proposition of 'The Silent Takeover' by Noreena Hertz: \\"On a wold wide scale, this internationalization of finance seriously limits the ability of advanced nations to carry out domestic fiscal and monetary policies that are not compatible with the \\"will\\" of a stateless world financial market.\\" (p.120)<BR>Their world vision was correct, but too timid: \\"On a still lager front, world population growth threatens to bring another billion people into existence within a generation, raising the spectre of large immigration pressures for the advanced world ... Ecological problems ... the forces of ethnic and nationalist unrest ... together with sporadic terrorism.\\" (p.120-121)<br />It is evident that the above mentioned problems can only be resolved by political intervention. The proceeds of the successes of the market economy canonly be redistributed or guided by political decisions, by politicians, not by, but with the help of, economists. The problem is that no international authority has enough power to impose his decisions unilaterally on national states.<BR>Ultimately, the decisions lay in the hands of the voters. If a majority votes for a certain direction, the political authorities have to follow, otherwise they will loose their mandate.<BR>This is a thought provoking book.	2002-12-05

The above mentioned slogan based on his works is perhaps the only thing that will rest of the theories of Wilhelm Reich, a very popular author in the nineteen sixties.<BR>Charles Rycroft gives an excellent and thorough analysis of Reich's work. He found that Reich didn't have a good knowledge of biology and physics and comes to the conclusion that his work is futile and not scientific (no rigorous experiments).<br />Reich's theories on mental illness are based on the (in)capacity to experience orgasm. He saw the roots for orgasmic inhibition in the 'authoritarian' (fascist) family. This is a patriarchal family not held together by parental love, but by repressive use of power by the father.<BR>The treatment of his patients was guided to the restoration of the orgasmreflex.<BR>But Reich went further and declared to have found in the universe 'orgone-energy', that he could capture with accumulators and use in the treatment of the mental ill.<br />It is evident that this theory is complete nonsense. The orgasmreflex has been cured today by Viagra (as simple as that).<br />This is the best possible analysis of a once very popular psychiatrist.	2002-12-05

This epic is one of the most cynical and grim satires ever written.<BR>Ysengrimus is the prototype of the monk disguised as a wolf. Christ was a shepherd for his sheep, the monks are wolves.<BR>With a strong and blasphemous vocabulary, Nivardus insults relentlessly the Church and her representatives: 'They sell human beings for money, and even God'.<BR>'You may commit what sins you want, you will be absolved if you can pay'.<BR>What only counts for the monk Ysengrimus is power and money. If you have them you stay above the law; if you don't, you are lost.<BR>But Nivardus takes revenge on the corrupt and wicked Ysengrimus through the hands of his nephew, Reinaert, the fox, who exploits in a gruesome manner the craving for power and money of his uncle. Ultimately, the Monk's skin is stripped off and his corps is thrown to the swine.<br />Apparently, this is the first time that the character of Reinaert, the fox, appears in the medieval literature. Here he is the avenger of the righteous, the poor, the real Christians.<br />In the latter works, Reinaert is portrayed as a cunning and cynical exploiter of human weaknesses. The social criticism of the Church disappeared. In this way, one could say that the author of the second Reinaert (Van den Vos Reinaerde) took revenge on the Ysengrimus by painting the fox as a not reliable and immoral character.<br />This epic is a powerful, colourful, lively and very modern work.<BR>A masterpiece.	2002-12-02

Semprun calls this party a complicated network of arrogant and corrupt men, based on favouritism.<BR>In his well-known associative style with many digressions, the author remembers his encounters as a minister with people like president Havel, the queen of England and baron Thyssen. These are mingled with flashbacks to his youth, Buchenwald, his father and the communist party (Important detail: a member of the Politburo in Moscow (Suslov) pled for an armed uprising in Spain in 1960 in the interest of the ... USSR).<br />Semprun's work is always captivating. His itinerary in the last century is exemplary for so many men who got disillusioned with their communist engagement.

While being emperor Justinian's official chronicler, and writing tons of paper on his master's heroic military feats, master buildings and law codings, Procopius got some remorse and wrote the real (secret) (hi)story of the emperor, his wife Theodora and her friend Antonina, the wife of his main general Belisarius.<BR>Both Justinian and Theodora were of very humble origin. His father was a shepherd, who became head of the Praetorian Guard and killed his master to snatch the throne for himself. She was the daughter of a beartamer, who performed 'lifeshows' on the stage with a ... swan. But they reigned like any other tyrant.<BR>The Aya Sophia is indeed a brilliant architectural monument (built by Henry of Milet); the Justinian Code is a remarkable judicial document; Justinian kept the Goths out of the remains of the Roman Empire. But are these achievements worth the death by his own decisions of (at least) 50 million of his own people, by setting up the green and the blue political parties against one another?

Harriet Sergeant lived several years in Japan and gives in this book an account of her experiences in that country. It is an appalling picture: endemic corruption (even for the purchase of a house), racketeering, religion as business, the excessive importance of the group to which one belongs to. A merciless, brutal, egoistic and aggressive social environment: already at school children are badgered, resulting in several deaths per year.<BR>But the biggest victims in this overcrowded country are a Japanese minority group (the burakumin) and women.<BR>The burakumin should be compared to the pariahs in India. Because of their discrimination, many of them joined the yakuza (the powerful, also politically, Japanese gangsters) and are now feared.<BR>Women are totally subordinate to men.

This book covers the whole history of the Order of the Templars.<BR>The Order was in fact an exception in the social organization of the Middle Ages: it combined two (of the three) orders: the first one (the nobility) and the second one (the clergy). This situation gave the Templars a very privileged status (for taxes for instance), but also ignited big envies.<BR>They were pioneers on different fronts. First, in finances: their headquarters in Paris were practically a central bank for Europe; all kingdoms had a line of credit there. They invented for instance the bill of exchange. Secondly, in commerce. They were in fact the first capitalists in Europe. They didn't keep their money in the bank, but invested heavily and with profit in agriculture to provide food for the crusaders.<br />Unfortunately, this book is too superficial and not always clear-cut. Demurger gives the facts, the battles, but he doesn't clearly explain the financial organization or the trial proceedings.<BR>He admits also very reluctantly, as if the honour of France was at stake, that the French king Philippe le Bel destroyed the Order only for financial reasons. We know from other work that the king contracted a very big loan from the Order, just before their persecution. If he could, with the help of the pope, condemn them, he didn't have to repay the money. Into the bargain, he could confiscate their possessions in France.<br />A better work is 'Der Prozesz gegen die Templer' by M.J. Krück von Poterzyn, but that work covers only the period of the trial.	2002-11-23

Bryan Magee's masterly confessions cover not only his philosophical work, but also his life as a Labour politician and his TV and writer's career.<br />As a politician, he was disappointed by the only marginal impact of government interventions and became a political Liberal. But his main aim has always been individual freedom.<br />His analyses of the philosophy of Popper, Russell, Kant, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Mill, Augustinus, Schelling, Fichte, Frege, and others, are profound, extremely clear and to the point (a rarity today).<BR>He is absolutely correct in his evaluation of the British language philosophy: she constitutes the bankruptcy of philosophy and ends in a morass of 'playing with words'. The assumption that everything can be expressed by words is too preposterous to take it even into consideration: how do you say a piano concerto of Mozart or the Mona Lisa. As one other philosopher asked in an interview on the BBC: have they nothing else to do in this world?<br />His world view is rather pessimistic: people are lead by false values (mimicry, compromise ...) rather than by love, loyalty to truth or integrity.<BR>Other leitmotivs in this book are his fear for death and the intellectual catastrophe of common sense (our senses discern nothing of what happens in the real, physical world: atoms, speed of the earth...)<br />Nevertheless, I disagree with him on one crucial point : his Kantian philosophical problem of the link between personal freedom and the determinist physical laws. For Magee, it is impossible to have individual freedom in an empirical world reigned by these laws. There must for him be a world (a part of the human body) outside these laws, that provides the foundation for freedom.<BR>I side here with Popper and Stephen Hawking who say that the solution of this problem lays in the brain. Our brain is subject to the uncertainty principle, in other words, to the randomness associated with quantum mechanics (S. Hawking 'Black Holes and Baby Universes).<br />For a refutation of Kant, see W. Heisenberg 'Physics and Philosophy'.<BR>This book constitutes an enriching and most entertaining dialogue with the reader. Not to be missed.	2002-11-23

When Curys unveils his intentions, the Greek first don't want to fight, but have no other choice.<BR>Cyrus' army is beaten and he dies in the battle of Cunaxa.<BR>Artaxerxes asks the Greek to hand in their arms and to surrender, but they refuse. Their leaders are murdered, when they accept an invitation for a negotiation on an orderly retreat. The 10000 Greek begin a hellish and bloody journey of 6000 km back home.

Love is composed by two totally different impulses: sexual attraction and protection, the mistress and the mother. For the anti-feminist Esther Vilar, those two functions are incompatible. That's why men should have the right to have (at least) two women.<br />A disaster for women, a cause for their inferiority? Not at all for Esther Vilar. Women should not be fooled. They have the power, first, to bear children (and to be protected by the father), and, secondly, to be sexually attractive and hold the men in their spell. It's a win-win situation. Women should use their own weapons and not try to mimic the masculine world, like the feminist movement is doing.<br />A beautiful reasoning, but practical? For me not.<br />The proposition could only work when men and women are on equal footing (education ...). This is actually not the case everywhere and every time. Secondly, there are other instincts, like jealousy. And thirdly, there are practical barriers. Men should have enough means to support two or more women. Most men who have the means, have a mother for the children and (a) mistress (es) (not always openly, by divorcing for instance). And finally, if some men have more than one woman, some men will have no woman: the Malthusian nightmare : no money, no honey.<br />A bold suggestion coming from ... a woman, told in an amusing and alluring style.<br />A book to recommend.	2002-11-16

But Lenin kept his power. As Tomsky said : there was only one party, the others were in prison.<BR>Pipes' picture is all too real: Lenin was - and there are reasons for it : his brother's death for instance - a cynical,  ruthless, aggressive agitator, who despised humanity and the workers to whom he told he was to create a paradise for them.<BR>He understood that farmers and industrial workers saw only their own interests, not his: to create a new society with new human beings.<BR>The results of his policies were dreadful: the USSR stopped to communicate health statistics to the WHO in the seventies, because they were too disastrous.<BR>When I was in Moscow, an important person in Russia (I saw recently a quote from him in an international newspaper) told me the following joke: why are Lenin's statues on the market place of every village?

I don't agree with the subtitle 'The death of democracy', but I consider this book more as a warning for the dangers that beleaguer democracy.<BR>I fully agree with the author that the dangers come from transnational companies, who don't know the national borders of the democratic elected governments. But the solution here is an elected transnational government (a daunting task for Europe, for instance).<BR>These companies, and rich individuals, get a bigger and bigger impact on national politics and have in some countries taken over the role of government (education, social security) for their employees. But if they move in a democracy against the majority of the population, they have no chance to implement their schemes.<BR>In this respect, I don't agree with the author that the fact that only 50% of the voters turn-out to vote effectively is a sign for a diminishing democracy. The reason for this limited turn-out is the fact that the items at stake are, in one way or another, 'marginal'. There will be a far bigger turn-out when in times of a deep economic depression, a candidate promises a decent life (work) for everybody.<br />Where I fully agree with the author is that a controlled capitalist system is the best solution to get economic growth (and that's what people want). The other option is a planned economy, in other words to give the economic power to the planners, to a bureaucracy.<BR>I also agree that the proceeds of this growth should be far better distributed. The economy is not a goal in itself, but a means to get a better life for everybody.<BR>But as Susan Strange stated in her work: most of the distribution of the proceeds of economic growth in the world was and is done by, and through the channels of, transnational companies ... in their own interest.<BR>The proposed means (consumer protest, shareholder activism, internet democracy) are only part of the solution. They can and will to some extent influence political decision making.

This small book deals only with the political and not the scientific part of Popper's work, thus mainly with 'The open society and its enemies' and 'The poverty of historicism'.<BR>It is an excellent introduction for this part of Popper's work.<BR>The author clearly explains that improvement or self-correction through freedom of speech (criticism) is only possible in democracies and not in dictatorial (fascist) or pseudo-scientific (marxist) systems of government.<BR>For me, he correctly recognizes the possible limits of Popper's proposition of 'piecemeal engineering' of political, social or environmental problems: \\"Is piecemeal engineering grand enough to deal with global pollution, genocidal oppression of minorities and pandemics such as AIDS?\\"<BR>He also sees clearly the actual dangers for democracies: \\"How are major corporations, with transnational funds and managements, to be controlled by democratic authorities whose writs run only to their frontiers?\\"<BR>Also some interesting facts (rare) about Popper's personal life.<BR>A very worth-while read.	2002-11-13

This novel is still a worth-while read, but some 'escapes' of the main characters are, although sometimes very original (still now), highly unlikely.<BR>This work has the same theme as 'Callirhoe' by Chariton written in the same century : monogamous love. The two lovers overcome  the most incredible difficulties, but will find each other at the end of the story to live happily together. <BR>The style is baroque, with long digressions and brutal scenes, like sacrificial death. The main aim is : sensationalism. <BR>It has not the psychological richness of 'Callirhoe'.

It is clear that kidnapped beautiful girls didn't have the same ultimate fortune of Callirhoe.<BR>New here is that her jealous husband is the cause of her misfortune, whereas normally it are the parents or another member of the family.<BR>This book is still a worth-while read and gives a good picture of the living conditions at that time.

We are all more or less children of sperm wars and we have all genes of rapists and killers in our body, otherwise we wouldn't be here.<BR>The sex scenes are explicit.

Although sometimes considered as an erotic work, this is in fact a philosophical novel about solipsism.<BR>This theme is treated brilliantly: a man looks through a hole in a wall in a hotel room into another room, where he observes scenes about life and death, like sex or a dying person who insults a priest.<BR>He always asks himself: is this real or are these scenes only in my thoughts? Does the world outside me exist? His answer is negative: I am alone.<BR>It brings him on the brink of schizophrenia. Even science cannot help him. But ultimately he chooses to continue to live, because there is still a sparkle of hope.

In this short book, Zweig sketches an impressive portrait of Erasmus as a private and a public person.<BR>Erasmus was an erudite humanist, but a loner (his motto: nulli concedo,...per se).<BR>He should be considered as the first European and a real pacifist ( for him, all conflicts should be solved by negotiation). But he was in no way a proponent of democracy, more a supporter of an oligarchic rule.<BR>His biggest failure was that he couldn't prevent the schism between Catholics and Protestants, although he played a crucial role in the negotiations. The Elector of Saxony, who protected Maarten Luther, asked him his opinion on the latter. But he couldn't give him a clearcut answer.<BR>Erasmus went a long way: \\"I am against the truth, if it causes dissension\\".<BR>He was too honest. He grasped that the compulsory selling of indulgences by the Pope was an unforgivable extortion.<BR>In this short text, Zweig tells us the ultimate tragedy of Erasmus' life: on the one hand, his belief in civilization and the power of reason; on the other hand, a world full of dissensions and war.<BR>Zweig writes in an enthusiastic style, full of drama and contrasts.<BR>A simple, but masterful psychological and historical analysis.	2002-10-31

Should I close this transaction? etc.<br />For trivial questions the clients got trivial answers. For more important questions about for instance war or peace, the answers were ambiguous (like the one Cresus got). The answers could be rigged, e.g. Themistocles bought the answer he wanted to get. There was even a corrupt Pythia (Perialla).<br />The authors proves unambiguously that oracles were the nerve centre of big political and economical interests.<br />There was a bitter competition between the different sites to get the best and richest clients.

Readers should have a fairly good knowledge of modern cosmology and quantum physics. Although the discussions about the Hubble constant, dark matter and the Guth inflation are impressively treated.<BR>If you like novels about scientists and scientific debates, this is a good one.

For insider David Puttnam, Europe who invented the movie, lost the movie industry battle due to external (two World Wars), but mostly internal causes:<BR>1. Europe, unlike the US, didn't see the movie industry as a   totality (control of production + distribution + theatres)<BR>2. Europe didn't want to understand the market (the consumer demand) and the power of marketing.<BR>3. the suicidal movie theorization by the left. As an example, J.L. Godard claimed that his struggle against the commercial imperialism of Hollywood was analogous to the eternal struggle of the working class against monopoly capitalism. Yet he was forced to acknowledge that 'workers don't come to see my films'.<BR>4. the vanity of the European film critics, who supported selfregarding movies, while the public went out to see US films.<BR>5. social causes: Hollywood defied the wishes of the US cultural elite and made 'popular' movies.<br />The movie industry in Europe has still not fundamentally changed since the publication of the book, but all inter- and subventions of the EEC commission will be wasted money, unless there is a big change of mind.<BR>The author gives implicitly some obvious measures for a revival:<BR>- take into account the consumer market.<BR>- a big part of the movie budget should be spent on marketing and promotion.<BR>More, there should be coproductions with TV channels and movie theatre companies on a European, or better, world scale. The market of each European country is not big enough to create a profitable movie industry. <BR>European big budget movies should be shot in English.<BR>It is easier said than done, but CANAL+ for instance has understood the challenge.<BR>Puttnam's book is absolutely not boring, but a must read for every European film maker.	2002-10-03

How can we determine its place? We measure its distance from the floor, from the back-wall and from the side-wall; these three figures determine its position in space. ... If we want to determine not a point in space but an event, we require another figure, namely, the statement of time. Suppose we switch on the light for a second and produce a flash of light; this is an event. It is completely determined if we know the three numbers defining the position of the lamp and, in addition, the fourth number defining the time of the light flash. Insofar as there are four figures, space and time together are called a four-dimensional manifoldness.

David Deutsch explains brilliantly how he sees parallel universes, but I agree with Rudolf Peierls, who said :&quot;In the more conventional language of Everett's interpretation, what you say is that you have to make an observation to see which of the universes you are in. But I prefer to use the word 'possibilities' or 'dictionary of possibilities', rather than 'universes'.&quot; (The ghost in the atom by P.C.W. Davies and J.R.

Therefore this book is a pure speculation : what are the implications of possibilities?<br />Otherwise, I agree with the reviewer 'Atheen Hills', that one should first read the works of the authors on which this book is based. He mentioned some; I should add Stephen Jay Gould.<br />Quotable: a brilliant notice by Bertrand Russell on inductivism:<BR>&quot;The chicken noticed that the farmer came every day to feed it. It predicted that the farmer would continue to bring food every day. Inductivists think that the chicken had 'extrapolated' its observations into a theory, and that each feeding time added justification to that theory.

This book is important because Heisenberg clearly explains why quantum mechanics was fatal for great philosophical theories, and more particularly, for logical positivism and Kant.<br />Logical positivism affirms that all knowledge is ultimately founded in experience. This led to a postulate concerning the logical clarification of any statement about nature. But since quantum theory such a postulate cannot be fulfilled.<br />Kant's a priori's like space and time are viewed totally differently since quantum theory. His law of causality is no longer true for the elementary particles, because we don't know the foregoing event accurately or this event cannot be found.<BR>Heisenberg states that it will never be possible by pure reason to arrive at some absolute truth.<br />Naturally this book is not up to date. It doesn't speak about COBE or superstrings. But Heisenbergs explanation of quantum theory is second to none.<br />Quotable.

Not an easy read.<BR>Here are a few of his arguments: (1) the world (e.g. chaotic processes) is not totally algorithmically compressible. (2) many constants of Nature got their values in the earliest stages of the universe. From the predictions emerging from the 'Theory of Everything, we should arrive at the current structure of the universe. This is nearly impossible. (3) If random elements of the Universe, inherited from its quantum origins, differ significantly from place to place, the knowledge of its global structure from our point of view will be incomplete. (4) Superstrings and its corollary 'many dimensions'. What happened with the vanished dimensions?<BR>To the bargain, the author believes that even if we should find this theory, the factual impact on our life would be very limited.<BR>Why then are all members of the physicists guild searching fot it? And why writes the author such a challenging book about it? It is like the quest of the Holy grail in the Middle Ages. The sheer beaty of Einstein's simple formula left everybody dumbfounded, but the person who will find a new equation 'for everything' would provoke a long lasting general silence followed by a burst of applause nearly as loud as the Big Bang.<BR>By the way, I am not so sure that the impact on our life of this theory would be limited.

Excellent explanation of the standard Copenhagen interpretation of the quantum world: in this world, events are governed by probabilities. A system (e.g. a photon) can behave as a wave or as a piece of matter. It is the act of observing that photon, that forces it to select one of these options, which then become 'real'. Otherwise, we have absolutely no idea what a photon is doing when we are not looking at it.<BR>Into the bargain, the uncertainty principle of Heisenberg says that we cannot know the present in all its details, for an electron for instance cannot possess both a precise momentum and a precise position. There are only probabilities.<BR>The philosophical impact of these 'facts' cannot be underestimated. Even Einstein could not accept it.<BR>As always with Gribbin, this work is easy to understand, also for the layman. This was absolutely not obvious for that kind of subject. His writing stimulates to read further work about physics and cosmology. It is a real exploratory expedition.	2002-09-04

This book is a conjecture about 'births' and 'histories' of living universes and about what we could call 'Darwinian cosmology'.<BR>Gribbin speculates that the collapse of a black hole can lead to a bounce which creates a new universe and every time a universe is created the laws of physics that it is born with are slightly different from those of its parent universe: universes mutate! Our universe is just one among a multitude of universes, and in some sense the many universes are competing with one another for the right to exist.<BR>The birth of a universe might simply be a fluctuation of the vacuum, a creation out of nothing, for if we consider that the gravitational enegy is negative, the energy required to make a universe is zero. <BR>For Gribbin, we are living in a black hole (a closed universe). He sides with S.J. Gould that the universe is not set up to create organic life-forms - we are only a side-effect; but he believes that carbon-based complex forms are a common feature in the Universe. He favours also the 'Big Crunch' scenario.<BR>He is most severe with mankind regarding ecology. I quote : 'Gaia will look after herself. And the best way for her to do that might well be to get rid of us.'<BR>Although this book is a complete conjecture, it should be read by everyone interested in cosmology. It is easily understandable even for a layman. I agree that some points are very questionable, like the Big Crunch scenario or his theory about the missing dark matter. But it is as passionate as a thriller.	2002-09-04

The itinerary of a South-Vietnamese student who becomes a Vietcong fighter in order to liberate his country from a corrupt regime and foreign occupation. After the war, he becomes a member of the Vietnamese government.

He was one of the boat people.<BR>A sad story all too well known: after victory, the idealists are thrown out (or killed) by the real power politicians or the real international powers backing those politicians.<br />This book confirms what we already knew: the American arrogant reliance on power, combined with a fatal misunderstanding of the nature and the strategy of the enemy. As a matter of fact, the US were winning on the battlefield even during the Tet offensive (the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese had colossal losses), but it was internationally turned into a decisive victory.<BR>I quote: \\"You know\\", said an American negotiator to his North Vietnamese counterpart three years later in Hanoi, \\"you never defeated us on the battlefield\\". \\"That may be so\\", came the answer, \\"but it is also irrelevant\\".<br />This book should be read by everyone interested in the sad story of the disastrous Vietnamese war. A war that should not be forgotten, but even the young generation in Vietnam has no or very few interest in it.<br />Quotable: the French communist leader Thorez:\\"If we can't reach an agreement with them (the Vietnamese nationalists), we'll talk to them with cannons\\".	2002-09-03

This book explains clearly what Einstein thought about God and religion.<BR>I quote the author: \\"A God who rewards and punishes is inconceivable to him for the single reason that a man's actions are determined by necessity, external and internal, so that in God's eyes he cannot be responsable, any more than an inanimate object is rsponsible for the motion it undergoes\\".<BR>For Einstein the demon of Laplace was all too real. He believed in total determinism. For him there was no free will. I quote Einstein: \\"I do not at all believe in human freedom in the philosophical sense. Everybody acts not only under external compulsion but also in accordance with inner necessity. Schopenhauer's saying, 'A man can do what he wants, but not want what he wants,' has been a real inspiration to me since my youth.\\"<BR>This stance by one of the most brilliant scientists ever is, for me, unbelievable. It had a profound influence on his later scientific work, where he tried in vain to refute quantum mechanics. He knew too well, as Bohr stated, that quantum mechanics gives free will a new background against the mechanical concept of nature.<BR>On the other hand, could Einstein's stance be an excuse for his not so high standard moral behaviour when he was a young man?<br />The last part of the book \\"Physics and theology\\" is only for theologians. It reminds me of the stubborn fight of Paul Davies in his book 'The mind of God' to find a place for God in modern physics and the quantum universe. Davies only found ... mysticism as a solace for the faithful.<BR>A revealing book.	2002-09-02

This book is one of the most astonishing works I ever read.<BR>The aim of the author is to find a place for God in the quantum universe, for he sides with Fred Hoyle who stated: &quot;I have always thought it curious that, while most scientists claim to eschew religion, it actually dominates their thought more than it does the clergy.&quot;<BR>After a long and stubborn search for God's place in the physical universe and after not finding it, the author recommends the faithful to turn to ... mysticism.<br />As always with Paul Davies, his scientific writing is outstanding: clear explanation and comments on the evolution of scientific thought and on the latest theories regarding physics, astronomy, cosmology, quantum mechanics. Some readers could become nervous because these comments are always mingled with the search for ... God, but that's the subject of the book. One star for the solution.

For the authors even the simplest animal life is uncommon in the universe, and intelligent life extremely rare. They believe that our earth is a very special case, because (1) there is more life diversity than on others planets, caused by sudden massive life extinction through meteor impact and by global climate change provoked by plate tectonics; and (2) earth is surrounded by 2 special planets: the moon and Jupiter. The moon causes lunar tides, stabilizes the tilt of Earth's spin axis, and it slows the Earth's rate of rotation. Jupiter was important in the formation of the earth.<BR>Their crucial argument is the importance of plate tectonics. They develop their argumentation very well: plate tectonics promotes biological productivity, diversity and helps maintain equable temperatures on earth. But how do they know that it is extremely rare in a cosmos of billions of billions of stars? This argument cannot be tested. So we and they don't know. Their case is built on ignorance.<br />Nevertheless, I recommend this book for its challenging proposition, although the text could be more condensed.	2002-09-01

I recommend this book as an introduction for everybody who is interested in this daunting subject. Daunting, because it was forbidden for the initiated to speak about the mystery. Nearly everything we know (besides artwork - Athens - architectural sites) came to us indirectly (e.g. the formidable play 'Bakchai' by Euripides).<BR>Furthermore, all sanctuaries were destroyed after the imperial decrees (391/392) of Theodosius the Great prohibiting all pagan cults.<BR>The author analyses 5 mystery cults : Eleusis, Meter, Isis, Mithras, and the Dionysian and Bacchian mysteries.<BR>As we can learn from the work of Karl Kerenyi, the influence of Eleusis on Christianity should not be underestimated. Apparently, through the myth of Demeter/Persephone, the initiated were 'shown' that there was life after death. Plato was initiated (as nearly all Roman emperors) and as Hannah Ahrendt tells us in her book 'The origins of Totalitarianism', Plato must be considered as one of the fathers of the Christian creed.<BR>For the mysteries of Mithras, I recommend the work of J. Vermaseren.<br />As Burkert states, most of the mysteries were expensive clubs and the experience was purely individual. That is the reason why they disappeared so rapidly: they lacked any lasting organization as the Christian Church. Another reason for Burkert was the inclusion of the family as the basic unit of piety in Christianity. The Church got the upper hand for demographic reasons.<BR>Contrary to Burkert, we know from the work of Kerenyi on Eleusis that the taking of drugs (the kykeon) was important (it was taken after a longer period of fasting).<BR>Burkert gives us a very good summary indeed.	2002-08-31

Brasillach was a political (anti-semitic, racist) commentator and novelist in France before and during WWII.<BR>As we can read in his memoirs, he was intellectually seduced by the racist and nationalistic work of Charles Maurras (L'Action Française). He had probably homosexual tendencies.<BR>After the war, he was condemned (3 against 1) for high treason and executed. <BR>For me, the author proves convincingly that the trial was excessive and unfair - the Liberation courts were essential Vichy courts! Brasillach was guilty for his writing, but should not have been shot. There was no strict cause-effect relationship between Brasillach's words and the murders and deportations that did take place in France.<BR>But I agree also with the author that with this trial there was much more at stake: free speech, the capacity of language to do real evil, the accountability of writers and intellectuals. It was a warning by the political power elite at that moment.<br />Good portraits of Albert Camus and Simone de Beauvoir.<br />A model study.

I recommend this book as a formidable try to unravel one of the most important ancient pagan mysteries, that survived for more than a thousand years in the Ancient world.<BR>For Kerenyi, the core of the mysteries was the message that 'a birth in death was possible', also for human beings. This message was 'shown' through the ancient myth of the search of Demeter for her ravished daughter Persephone. She finds Persephone under the earth, where she gives birth to Dionysos. The hope of life in death was symbolized through Demeter's offering of the grain, that will grow again. We can see this important hapenning on a stele in the Ancient museum of Athens.<BR>The initiated had to fast and were given a drug (the kykeon) just before the procession.<BR>Nearly all Roman emperors were initiated (with a special place for Marcus Aurelius).<BR>One of the initiated was Plato, who speaks about it in his work 'Phaidoon'.<BR>The influence on Christianity by the mysteries cannot be underestimated, for Plato's theory of the soul was adopted by the Church.<BR>A compelling read.	2002-08-31

Pool is able to give us a compelling report about who really financed the Nazi-party and why Hitler had friends in high places, and that despite the fact that many first hand historical documents disappeared.<BR>First, there was the fear for communism (Fritz Thyssen, Henri Deterding of Royal Dutch, Norman Montagu of the Bank of England ...). These people supported Hitler's party to win the working class and the ruined lower middle class away from communism.<BR>Secondly, his anti-semitism (Henry Ford). Third, his racist/nationalist stance (the secret Thule society: a group of lawyers, judges, professors, policemen, aristocrats, scientists and businessmen). Fourth, friendly rgimes (Mussolini).<BR>And last but not least, the donations of his party members and his daily newspaper (a milk cow).<BR>Pool gives us a penetrating picture of the political/economical situation in Germany after the First World War: the unbearable Versailles Treaty, the poverty, the unemployment, the hopeless division of the political parties and the plotting of von Papen and his backers, who supported Hitler when his party was losing support, for fear that his followers would jump over to the communists. Von Papen thought that after the elections, he would easily get rid of Hitler, a terrible mistake.<BR>Pool convinced me of the ease with which money can subvert the democratic process.<BR>One of the more controversial statements in this book is the reason of the abdication of King Edward VIII of England: not because of Mrs. Simpson, but because of his pro-Nazi attitude.

This hard hitting, thought provoking book should be read by everyone. <BR>The author sides with S.J. Gould that evolution has no goal (no anthropic cosmological principle). Species evolve by natural selection. The brain exists because it promotes survival and multiplication of the genes. He goes even further: the capacities to select particular esthetic judgments and religious beliefs must have arisen by natural selection. He argues that human beings are innately aggressive and fight wars to gain long-term reproductive success.<BR>He hits hard at the interpretation of sexuality by Judaism and Christianity: the sex rules are biological and written by natural selection. In that way, he defends homosexuality.<BR>Facing human nature as it is and evolves, how can we make life better: by the true Promethean spirit of science to liberate man by giving him knowledge and some measure of dominion over himself and his environment.<BR>It will be difficult to refute the strong arguments of the author. He forces us to face the real realities of life and nature. The only solution is knowledge in order that mankind can take the necessary measures to save this planet.<BR>By the way, he sneers at T.

The writing is not as combative, although it has many of the same themes :<BR>- human aggression (he does not agree with Konrad Lorenz - even aggression evolves rapidly - and Erich Fromm - humanity is not suicidal -)<BR>- the fallacy of ethics (human nature is to a large extent the heritage of a Pleistocene hunter-gatherer existance)<BR>- the place of mankind in Gaia (the totality of Life on Earth). He argues clearly that if human beings were to disappear, the world would go on little changed and would heal itself from the damage inflicted by mankind. The only necessary animals,for Gaia and also for the human species, are the invertebrates.<BR>Perhaps the most controversial point of the book are his arguments in defence of racial differences in the human populations, based on genetic components.

A pope who alone knew the truth and who founded a secret commission to protect his 'church' against the heathen. He was a bad psychoanalyst (e.g. the Wolf Man case) and a venal man (e.g. the catastrophic Horace Fink case, where he tried to get his own hands on some money of the heiress).<br />I agree with the author that psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience - statements cannot be tested and the research results cannot be verified uniformly. Although it is not totally without meaning (Karl Popper), it is not a science.<br />(2) the revenge of the repressed<br />A frontal attack on the caste of the psychoanalysts, depicted as 'religious zealots, self-help evangelists, sociopolitical ideologues, and outright charlatans who trade in the ever seductive currency of guilt and blame, while keeping the doctor's fees mounting.'<br />The author is particularly severe with their latest 'school' : the 'recovered memory movement', based on the rape of children by their parents (really!). This lead to false accusations and condemnations of innocent people. No wonder the author predicts an accelerating collapse of psychoanalysis as a respected institution.<br />A much needed and courageous book to halt a profession riding at full speed on a misty highway. And a much needed angle on Freud as a person, written in a style to slaughter the not so innocent father of psychoanalysis.<br />After reading this book, I agree with Peter Medawar, who called doctrinaire psychoanalytic theory \\"the most stupendous intellectual confidence trick of the twentieth century\\".	2002-08-28

At the end of his life, he allowed himself to be totally neutralized by an American CIA agent (I quote Bryan Magee).
