This one was given to me as a gift, and I approached it without knowing anything about either the author or his character, Gabriel Allon. I found \\"The English Assassin\\" to be a well-written novel, with decent characterization and a good pace. The Gabriel character himself was, for me, the most interesting part of the book, and the one thing that might someday cause me to pick up another Silva novel.<br /><br />That said, there were a number of things about the book that I found relatively unsatisfying, most of which I think I can mention without giving away the ending. For one thing, Silva's portrayal of the evil Swiss was pretty heavy-handed. I don't know how much of what's here comes from Silva's own research or conclusions, how much was ginned up to ride the wave of \\"expos&eacute;s\\" of Swiss complicity in Nazi horror that came out in the late 1990s, and how much of it was manufactured for the purposes of this novel. But for a balance to the novel's subtext that Switzerland is the last outpost of the Third Reich, I recommend the nonfiction [[ASIN:089526238X Between the Alps & A Hard Place: Switzerland in World War II and Moral Blackmail Today]] by Angelo M. Codevilla (2000).<br /><br />Looking at the story itself, I thought the conclusion was somewhat unsatisfying, and the action described in the very last chapter more than a little out of character for the people involved. It's certainly true that spycraft seldom has the satisfying endings -- filled with massive and colorful explosions -- we've come to expect from James Bond movies. The tradition of spy novels leaving the reader thinking \\"That's it?\\" is hardly new, and captures the shadowy world in which these people operate. But from a storytelling standpoint, it leaves a little to be desired.<br /><br />On the whole, however, Daniel Silva is a formidable talent. The story certainly held my attention, moved quickly, and focused on characters who (with the exception mentioned above) acted true-to-life.

Sayers, and Lord Peter Wimsey	Books	5	34	34	N	N	Essential reading for the Wimsey fan	More than most popular mystery sleuths, Lord Peter Wimsey was a man (and a character) who belonged to a specific era. When the hopeful optimism and sense of promise of the 1920s and early 30s were overshadowed by crisis after crisis and the growing specter of war, Lord Peter became a fish out of water, and so faded into well-deserved retirement.<br /><br />So argue the authors of this fascinating book -- one that any Wimsey fan, or fan of English mysteries generally, should find most rewarding. There's actually quite a lot more to this title than the argument described above. It is, to various degrees, a biography of Dorothy L. Sayers, a dual biography of Lord Peter and Harriet Vane, a social history of England between the wars, an exercise in literary criticism, and an at-least-partial survey of the history of the mystery novel. That's a lot to pack into fewer than 250 pages, but the authors pull it off really well.<br /><br />As befits a book with so much going on, there were several elements of it I found most interesting. These included the discussion of Lord Peter's development as a character and the difficulties Sayers had in plausibly marrying him off to Harriet; the impact of contemporary events on Sayers' fiction; and why (tied into that last item) Sayers didn't publish, or even work on, with one exception, any more Wimsey stories after 1936, even though he was still immensely popular.<br /><br />One of the reasons Lord Peter was, and remains, so popular is that he is a well-rounded character, not simply a crime-solving machine like Sherlock Holmes (which, of course, hasn't affected Holmes' popularity either). I highly recommend \\"Conundrums for the Long Week-End\\" for anyone interested in understanding Lord Peter still further and recognizing how impressive Dorothy L. Sayers' accomplishment truly is.<br /><br />(Which reminds me, if you want to know more about Lord Peter's era, I also strongly recommend [[ASIN:0393311368 The Long Week-End: A Social History of Great Britain 1918-1939]] by Robert Graves and Alan Hodge, a book which obviously influenced McGregor and Lewis, up to and including their choice of title.)obert Graves and Alan Hodge, a book which obviously influenced McGregor and Lewis, up to and including their choice of title.)	2005-10-05

(sort of)	Any more-than-casual fan of Sherlock Holmes is aware of \\"the great game\\" -- the body of research and writing known as Sherlockiana or Holmesiana (depending I think on what side of the Atlantic you're on) dedicated to establishing a Sherlockian chronology, identifying disguised personages, resolving apparent inconsistencies, and generally increasing the sum of the world's knowledge about the life and work of the world's first consulting detective.<br /><br />Lord Peter Wimsey, the shining light of the next generation of British detectives, has never quite been subjected to the same sort of passionate scrutiny. In part, that's because his creator, Dorothy L. Sayers, was quite explicit in dating his adventures: If she says \\"Unnatural Death\\" took place in spring, 1927, her stories have the internal evidence to prove it.<br /><br />Interestingly, however, Sayers herself was a Sherlockian and an experienced player of the great game. And so when C.W. Scott-Giles contacted her in the 1930s with the mock-serious premise that the heraldic achievement of the Wimsey family suggested great antiquity deserving of further researches, Sayers joined right into the fun. This book, published many years later, is the fruit of their exchanges.<br /><br />Unlike much Sherlockiana, which is meant to supplement and enhance Dr. Watson's stories, this book doesn't really add a lot to our understanding of Sayers' work. And so, it's not essential reading. It is, however, a quick and entertaining read, sure to be a worthwhile diversion for Wimsey fans.	2005-10-05

It's more journalistic and well-informed on Vatican inside-baseball than Stephen Mansfield's \\"Pope Benedict XVI: His Life and Mission,\\" but still well below the standard set by John L. Allen's \\"The Rise of Benedict XVI.\\"<br /><br />This book, like Gaul, is divided into three parts. The first is a capsule history of the papacy that Tobin may well have written in advance, intending to insert into his book on the new pope whoever he turned out to be. The last section is a list of all previous popes, with a quick description of them and the events of their reign. This leaves only about 70 pages for Joseph Ratzinger -- and really even less than that. That's because the final chapter, \\"Urbi et Orbi: The State of the Church in the World\\" is a recitation of the challenges facing the Roman Catholic Church as Tobin sees them, and how he expects the new pope to deal with them. In this chapter too, it felt a little like Tobin left a space reading \\"[fill in new pope's name here]\\" so he could polish it off as soon after the election as possible.<br /><br />I would have loved to have seen Tobin's reaction to that election. That's because in his 2003 book \\"Selecting the Pope: Uncovering the Mysteries of Papal Elections,\\" Tobin memorably wrote, \\"A curial cardinal is, almost by definition, not *papabile.* Although Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith -- which used to be the Holy Office, and before that the Inquisition -- is a highly regarded theologian and intellectual, he is one of the least likely to be elected pope.\\" Oddly, Tobin chooses not to address his error in this new book.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quick introduction to the new pope, this book isn't a bad place to start, as long as you keep in mind the errors and misstatements other reviewers have pointed out. But if you are willing to invest a bit more time in the project, I would still encourage you instead to find a copy of Allen's \\"Rise of Benedict XVI\\" (but don't confuse that book with his other one titled \\"Pope Benedict XVI,\\" which is really his older Ratzinger biography reissued with a new title; Allen has quite properly backed away from some of what he wrote in that earlier book).n the project, I would still encourage you instead to find a copy of Allen's \\"Rise of Benedict XVI\\" (but don't confuse that book with his other one titled \\"Pope Benedict XVI,\\" which is really his older Ratzinger biography reissued with a new title; Allen has quite properly backed away from some of what he wrote in that earlier book).	2005-09-30

If a three-star rating means that a book is \\"average,\\" this one is about as average as they come, even given the perhaps-unusual setting of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis.<br /><br />It strikes me that anyone who's read \\"Tom Brown's School-Days\\" or other examples of the English schoolboy story will recognize all the requisite characters and plot points here. Dick Clinton of Maine comes to the Academy younger and smaller than all his classmates, and is promptly nicknamed \\"Pewee.\\" Predictable adventures ensue, including hazing by a popular and athletic fellow plebe; a semi-protective friendship with a somewhat mysterious upperclassman; flights over the wall and other violations of regulations; nervous interactions with pretty Annapolis girls in petticoats; and ultimately a cheating scandal that threatens to ruin Pewee in the eyes of his class and have him \\"bilged\\" from the Academy. Through it all, Pewee maintains the sort of priggish uprightness and devotion to duty and honor schoolboy heroes of the era were expected to display.<br /><br />I'd love to know what prompted the author, William O. Stevens, to write this story. A member of the Annapolis English department since 1904, Stevens is described in an article on the Academy's website as one of a group of professors who \\"introduced the systematic study of literature into the midshipman curriculum.\\" He was also the author or co-author of numerous non-juvenile books, including naval science textbooks and a well-regarded history of the U.S. Navy. I haven't been able to locate any other juvenile fiction he wrote, so perhaps this was just him trying his hand at something new.<br /><br />Whatever the cause, he produced a book that jumps through all the requisite hoops of pre-war school stories. The Annapolis it portrays is largely unrecognizable today (except, sadly, for the cheating scandal), and I should point out that its depiction of African-Americans and the language used to describe them is distinctly unpleasant. I can't believe it would hold much interest today, except as a curious relic of the era, which was just the spirit in which I read it.that its depiction of African-Americans and the language used to describe them is distinctly unpleasant.

Allen, and so I readily admit Allen's work is my yardstick, for better or worse, for measuring other books about the new pope. Stephen Mansfield, author of \\"The Faith of George W. Bush\\" as well as books on Churchill, Booker T. Washington, and \\"The Faith of the American Soldier,\\" among others, has produced a biography of the pope that while hardly approaching Allen's standards for insightful journalism, does give a respectful, elevated, and even \\"inspirational\\"-reading introduction to the man.<br /><br />Mansfield's book is a decent capsule biography that shows why Ratzinger is controversial -- particularly in the American Catholic church -- without getting down-and-dirty in the details of theological or personality conflicts. Most interesting is his assertion that Ratzinger underwent a \\"makeover\\" in the days before the Conclave. Mansfield argues that Ratzinger's speeches became more polished, his \\"personal style\\" became more relaxed, and even that his prominent role in the various memorials and celebrations of the late pope's life were part of the German's effort \\"to show himself as the leader the Church clearly needed\\" (p. 144). Perhaps as a non-Catholic, a writer on presidents, and someone relatively unfamiliar with the rituals and mores of the Vatican, Mansfield fell into the not-uncommon trap of seeing a Conclave as akin to a presidential election. Allen, who knows the Vatican much more thoroughly, painted a somewhat different picture in his book on the new pope. Mansfield's outsider perspective certainly has value, but in this case I'm more inclined to give Allen's view greater weight.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Pope Benedict XVI is someone for whom American conservatives -- religious and political, Protestant and Catholic -- are likely to have considerable interest and sympathy. As he is the author of a book on President Bush's faith, and cites interviews with Michael Novak and Fr. Richard John Neuhaus, I feel pretty confident placing Mansfield in that camp. While not as in-depth a portrait as it's possible to find elsewhere, neither is this either firebreathingly negative or hagiographically flattering. It's a decent balance, a good introduction, and a pretty quick read.ith Michael Novak and Fr. Richard John Neuhaus, I feel pretty confident placing Mansfield in that camp.

Shaving is something most of us men do anyway, so it makes sense to do what we can to change it from a chore (or a butchery) into an enjoyable or even luxurious experience. If you're trying to look professional for a day at work -- or attractive and manly for a night on the town -- why drag a 20-cent disposable blade across your face when there are more rewarding alternatives out there?<br /><br />As part of the fashion and grooming industries' efforts to get men to take as much time preparing themselves for the day as women stereotypically do, Myriam Zaoui and Eric Malka produced this book on shaving that -- wonders! -- happens to have the same name as the store they run and the line of products they sell in it. I have a copy of their store catalog here next to this book, and there is a good deal of overlap, no question. The sorts of products they say a good shave requires just so happen to be the sorts of products they sell. Whether this is a conspiracy to create a need where none exists or their attempt to be helpful and inspire men to share the authors' passion for the topic, depends I suppose on your degree of cynicism.<br /><br />To the extent this book is an infomercial for their shop, you're certainly welcome to keep the info- and disregard the -mercial. I wouldn't throw the razor out with the soapy water and say the book is useless because there's a mercenary element. Every author hopes you'll spend money on his book. You can still learn some useful theory and tips for your morning ritual without having to drop any cash in the authors' store.<br /><br />The essentials of how to get a good shave have been covered countless times, at article-length, in publications like \\"Esquire.\\" You don't really need an entire book on the history and techniques of shaving. The fact that one exists is harmless enough, and men interested in fashion, grooming, or just not going to work with blood on their collars may find it worth a few minutes' reading.	2005-09-22

Though some reviewers raved about how he brought forgotten presidents \\"to life\\" for them, I still fail to see the point in bringing William Henry Harrison \\"to life\\" if all you know about him are a couple of People Magazine irrelevancies. Combine that with conventional political sneers breezily delivered and you've got perfect modern history-writing.<br /><br />\\"Oh lighten up. It's all in fun.\\" Okay: If you liked the author's last dive into hip, ironic, personality-driven history, you'll probably like this one. In fact, I found it less objectionable because the relative historical anonymity -- even insignificance -- of most American first ladies fits better with the author's interest in trivia in the first place. (I recall one newspaper editor gushing about Jacqueline Kennedy not long ago, saying something to the effect that she was \\"the first first lady to go to college, the first one to have lived overseas, the first one to speak a foreign language!\\" None of which is even remotely true.)<br /><br />While O'Brien largely glossed over most of what was important in the presidents' terms in office, his thumbnail biographies of the first ladies tend to be balanced and fairly comprehensive. And although he still gets his digs in at Nixon, Reagan, and George Dubya, his chapters on Mrs. Nixon, Mrs. Reagan, and Mrs. Bush (both of them, actually) are fair and even sympathetic.<br /><br />I'm not sure precisely who the target market is for this book. But if people in that demographic are seeking lightweight reading that tells them a little bit, maybe, about American history and politics, then I suppose this will suit them well enough.	2005-09-16

Schulz drew -- first by himself and later with collaborator Jim Sasseville -- a one-panel, sports-themed comic strip. For Schulz fans who, whetted by the Fantagraphics \\"Complete Peanuts\\" series, are inspired to find and read most everything Schulz ever drew, this little book makes an interesting addition to get hold of.<br /><br />However, its interest -- to me as I suppose for most readers -- has far more to do with the creator than with the creation. These one-panel strips just aren't as interesting as \\"Peanuts.\\" There are no recurring characters, no storyline, and no particular topic apart from the sports themes themselves. Of course, just as in \\"Peanuts,\\" there's an underlying sense of people beset by the human condition, and a few sighs, wails, and cries of despair that will be familiar to any \\"Peanuts\\" fan.<br /><br />What made this collection most interesting to me was to imagine it as a peek into what the \\"Peanuts\\" characters would have been like had they ever grown up. And in fact, in the commentary that is interspersed with the art, Sasseville writes that \\"it's not accidental that some of the adults look like grown-up Peanuts kids. It was harder to emulate Sparky's adults than the kids.\\" And so it's easy to see a middle-aged Charlie Brown seated at a table, looking at a deck of cards and saying (as a young Charlie Brown might have said on his pitcher's mound) \\"How can a good player like me lose all the time?\\" (p. 15) or, before his collection of little-bitty trophies, \\"Oh, I've won my share of tournaments all right, but I'm afraid none of them was very important\\" (p. 22). The chess-playing grandpa on page 45, however, has to be Linus. There's no other explanation.<br /><br />This collection has its laughs, but it doesn't have the magic of \\"Peanuts.\\" It is interesting to see the familiar lettering and drawing style applied to unfamiliar art, and even more interesting to see this corner of Sparky's mind.

In it, he presents his conclusions on good versus bad borders between nations, and analyses a range of political, ethnic, geographical, religious, economic, and other considerations diplomats and politicians have balanced over the years when drawing their lines on maps.<br /><br />K-L focuses on the tensions created by European borders of the time -- both the de jure ones from 1939 and the de facto ones created by the war -- and warns that \\"many grave issues\\" remain to be dealt with once the war ends. \\"As long as ethnic nationalism exists as a powerful sentiment there can only be makeshift solutions, and ethnicism is far from having run its course\\" (p. 79).<br /><br />The author makes a number of procedural suggestions for how post-war borders should be derived, including a plea that actual geographers be intimately involved in the process. Whereas he compares politicians dictating borders to geographers as like brick-layers dictating to architects, \\"The discipline of true geographic studies which form a bridge from the sciences to the humanities ... can help, if fostered in the right spirit, to teach the nations to delight in multiciplicity and at the same time to discern humbly the difference between 'mine' and 'thine'\\" (p. 82).<br /><br />K-L is hardly to be faulted for not foreseeing the revolutionary, not to say barbaric, matchstick shuffle at Yalta that created the Oder-Neisse line between Poland and Germany (though he has some prophetic things to say about mass expulsions of populations), nor for the fact that ethnic tensions and border disputes were muffled for fifty years under the weight of the Iron Curtain. Is Europe (save the Balkans) now beyond the era of national borders and ethnic animosities as the continent becomes more \\"united\\" from the top down? I imagine K-L had much to say about this.

This novel, published in German in 1935 and translated into English in 1936, when the author was 27 years old, gives some fascinating insights into the author and his thinking in the years before Hitler's war. It's also an interesting, sometimes disturbing, occasionally confusing, and ultimately rewarding work of fiction.<br /><br />One thing I've found about K-L fiction is that the published and oft-recycled (on antiquarian booksellers' web sites) descriptions of those works aren't entirely on-point. \\"Night Over the East\\" is generally described as the adventures of a young Hungarian aristocrat in the Balkans, but it's actually quite a bit more than that.<br /><br />Albert Kloibner is Hungarian by citizenship, but in fact is Austrian-German by nationality, nobility by social position, relatively rich, and a Catholic -- all of which put him at odds with the currents and passions of Hungary in the 15 years after the first world war. And so as the novel opens, Albert has fled to a particularly deserted part of Petsamo, an arctic region that had transferred from Soviet Russia to independent Finland after the war (and which would, as it happens, be reincorporated into the Soviet Empire after 1944). After several years in the north, Albert encounters Desider, a Hungarian student in Finland, who convinces him to end his Arctic exile and return to Budapest.<br /><br />Much of the central portion of the novel describes Albert's experiences in Hungary as the nation struggles with not only the Great Depression but also the effects of political turmoil in the Balkans spilling over into Hungary itself. (Rather more familiarity with Hungarian history would have helped me here.) In the last section, the novel turns much darker as K-L describes the Serbian subjugation of Croatia, Macedonia, and other parts of what would become Yugoslavia. Albert and his friends are caught up in this, and the novel ends in a way that -- while not an unpredictable resolution for Albert himself -- is still more than a little depressing.<br /><br />This certainly seems to have been K-L's intent. In a preface to my second edition, K-L writes that \\"Night Over the East\\" was written to document the horrors afflicting South Eastern Europe to which England and the West were largely, through their own complacency, ignorant. Consequently, this is a novel with Something To Say, and it is interesting to see some of the arguments K-L later developed in his nonfiction work starting to swirl around here in his early novels.<br /><br />Taken as a novel, this book does have its unsatisfying points. Interestingly, and unlike his later work, this novel was written in German. It was translated \\"and adapted,\\" not by the author himself, but by Edwin and Willa Muir, whom a quick Google tags as a Scottish poet and his wife (they also translated Kafka's \\"Metamorphosis\\"). I'm tempted to ascribe to their \\"adaptation\\" one of the biggest hurdles I encountered in this book, the very long descriptive sentences with which the novel begins. Here, for example, is a randomly-chosen sentence from the third page of the novel: \\"The son of the minister of Alaluostari, who owned the only shop in Petsamo and sold whip-stocks, school exercise-books, revolvers, and mattresses, might sit blank and taciturn over his dram of spirits, but as he sat there on the hard bench, his fists on his cheek-bones, he was devoid of all envy or resentment, all ill-will or bitterness; the priest of Parkkina with his filthy mat of hair and his reek of garlic could hardly write, and the Koltta Lapps of K&auml;&auml;nt&ouml;mukka and Moskova, the fishermen of Vaitolahti and Pummanki, were all simple, slow-witted people with no interest in Bergson or the rate of the Czechoslovakian exchange, in auction bridge or the Concours Hippique at Vienna.\\"<br /><br />Fortunately, those are out of the way pretty quickly. In the novel's midsection, K-L seems to have forgotten the old writer's rule of \\"show them, don't tell them.\\" In other words, there is an awful lot of narration -- exposition of things that might better have been relayed in dialogue. And even then, there is a lot more talking than action. The final section speeds up quite a bit, but it wasn't entirely convincing to me that Albert and all his friends would have been wrapped up in things quite the way they ended up being.<br /><br />So this isn't, as I say, the Great Austrian (or English, or Hungarian, or American) Novel, and it still holds more interest for me because of the author than the subject. But that said, it's not a bad story by any means, and at times I found it more than a little absorbing.

And Carson Kressley, you're not quite Alan Flusser.<br /><br />Which isn't to say this is a bad book as far as it goes. The author has a lot of very good insights into what works and what doesn't in men's wear. While I don't imagine many of the men who could most use this book are at all anxious to be seen reading it, I hope at least the women in their lives will take the subtitle to heart, read this book themselves, and exercise their subtle influence on their men. There are a lot of very good insights in here, and things nearly all men -- and most especially younger men -- can learn with profit.<br /><br />That said, I'm not sure Carson Kressley put enough stress on the essential point, the key understanding, the very nub so to speak of men's style, which is that the phrase \\"men's fashion\\" is an oxymoron. I was reading the other day about Lapo Elkann, grandson of Gianni Agnelli and a marketing chief at Fiat. He inherited a couple dozen of his grandfather's suits, some made a half-century or more ago, wears them daily, and looks great and entirely in-style in them.

Some of these, like the value of audiobooks or the usefulness of writing reviews of books after you finish them (ahem), I was already clued into. Others, like the technique of \\"superficial reading\\" or reading the starts and ends of chapters before diving in in-depth, were new to me and I look forward to giving them a try. What I think I found most attractive about this, however, was the author's clear love of reading and of books. That made this title not only a quick read, but also, so to speak, a very friendly one.<br /><br />Even more interesting to me than the more broad-brush tips, though, were some of Leveen's comments and observations. After many years as a Preservationist, I am slowly developing as a \\"Footprint Leaver\\" -- i.e., someone who writes in his books. Leveen not only defends the practice but celebrates it, and offers ideas for how to leave more useful notations than a scribbled \\"so true!\\" in the margin. I also concur with his rejection of the value of speed-reading classes, since speed doesn't necessarily equate to comprehension. And I was especially intrigued by his suggestion that if you like a book, write the author (if he's still alive) a short note and tell him so! This can lead sometimes to interesting exchanges and, once in a while, even friendships.<br /><br />Finally, I agree entirely with the author's encouragement to readers not to be intimidated or overly-influenced by other people's ideas for what \\"you should be reading.\\" From friends' recommendations to lists of \\"classics\\" compiled by experts, give these ideas the respect you think they deserve. But the one thing Steve Leveen or anyone else cannot do is give you more hours in your day. Read the books you want to read, adopt the ideas in this book that help you get what you want from them, and enjoy the present and future rewards of doing so.	2005-09-08

Clearly, this book doesn't compare to Adm. Morison's magisterial \\"History of United States Naval Operations in World War Two.\\" But then, how many things do? As you would expect from this publisher, \\"The U.S. Coast Guard in World War II\\" is a comprehensive and well-informed survey that should, almost 50 years after it was published, still be of use to service-members, historians, and interested readers.<br /><br />Combat operations were only one part of the USCG's activities during the war, as this book makes amply clear. In fact, I found some of the most interesting sections of the book didn't have to do with combat at all, per se, but rather with port security arrangements and the recounting of fires, accidents, sabotage, and other threats the service had to deal with. For the Coast Guard, at least, American beaches and harbors were very much on the front lines.<br /><br />When the discussion does turn to service under fire, the meaning of the oft-repeated statement that \\"in war, the Coast Guard becomes part of the Navy\\" becomes quite clear. Frankly, for much of this section, Coast Guard activities are an addendum to the story of the Navy and Marine Corps. It's important to note that Coast Guardsmen and Coast Guard-manned ships participated in practically every amphibious operation in any theater of the war, from sailing LSTs to acting as beachmasters, to running rescue fleets, though they seldom operated independently. Instances when Coast Guard forces did do that -- such as Coast Guard Rescue Flotilla One during the Normandy landing -- make for especially interesting reading. But even amid the larger picture of naval operations, the valor and dedication of Coast Guard personnel, and their special commitment to saving lives and aiding ships in danger, comes through strongly. For the student of World War II naval operations, this book fills a gap I'd bet many of us didn't even realize we had.	2005-08-29

The book is clearly a father's tribute to a son he missed and loved dearly. It's also an interesting angle on a cadet's experience at the academy in the early 1960s, given that the story is told almost entirely through Joe's letters home from school.<br /><br />Given the elder Mr. Hughes' evident grief over his son's death, it seems almost uncharitable to point out the shortcomings in the book. Nevertheless...<br /><br />The most obvious shortcoming is that the epistolary format really doesn't let us know Joe all that well. While we're given a pretty good amount of insight to what was on his mind during his years in New London, the portrait that emerges from the memorial tributes to Joe following his death (the author tells us from the beginning that Joe died shortly after graduation, so that's no surprise; what was surprising was how he died and when, details I'll leave to the reader to discover) is more than a bit different. For example, Mr. Hughes is generous in sharing Joe's report cards with us (and not to be insensitive, but I'm sorry: there's no one whose life was so significant that they deserve to have their second-grade report cards quoted in full in their biography), and Joe seemed, for a good part of his Academy career, a pretty consistent C student. He had his As and Bs, but also his D-minuses and failures. So it was something of a surprise to read other cadets and graduates talking about what a promising officer he was.<br /><br />The other things I would have liked to have seen more discussion of the are the service and the Academy itself. Given the book's title and emphasis, Joe's dedication to the USCG, and the author's pride in his son's service, there's surprisingly little about why Joe chose the Coast Guard in the first place, or what he hoped for in a career. The author tells us Joe decided early-on on military service. And in the first section, we're treated to letters from the admissions departments of not just the USCGA, but also the Air Force Academy, the Merchant Marine Academy, and the California Maritime Academy. But then, all of a sudden, Joe's reporting to New London.<br /><br />My purpose in reading this book was to try to get a sense of the life of a cadet at the Coast Guard Academy. And given that these events happened over 40 years ago, I think I still got something of an idea about that. I also was introduced to a man who I think would have been a treat to know. I don't know whether the \\"Ensign Joseph Henry Hughes, III, Memorial Award\\" his father endowed is still being awarded by the Academy, but if it is, I think the men or women who receive it might find this title worth reading too.ells us Joe decided early-on on military service.

And on one reading of John L. Allen's \\"The Rise of Benedict XVI,\\" you'd be able to make a case that the election of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger to the papacy was pretty much inevitable. But it's to Allen's credit as a journalist that he doesn't succumb to the \\"historian's fallacy.\\" In fact, I think he makes a good case that Ratzinger's election was not only not inevitable, but in some ways even more revolutionary than the election of Karol Wojtyla in 1978.<br /><br />Prior to the 2005 conclave, conventional wisdom made Ratzinger's election look pretty unlikely.  One \\"what's going to happen at the next conclave\\" book by a well-known writer on Catholic topics even said flat out, \\"Although Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ... is a highly regarded theologian and intellectual, he is one of the least likely to be elected pope.\\"<br /><br />What made Ratzinger's election happen -- and the discussion of which makes this such an interesting book -- is what Allen calls \\"the funeral effect.\\" Although leaders of the Roman Catholic Church knew Pope John Paul II was popular, it wasn't until they saw first-hand the world's response to his death that they realized the transforming effect he had on the Church's position in the world. Conventional wisdom said that the College of Cardinals would probably select a quiet, pastoral type with solid administrative skills to allow the Church some \\"breathing room\\" to process and assess the legacy of John Paul. But \\"the funeral effect\\" made it clear that the Church -- and the pope in particular -- now had a spot on the world stage that could not be filled by a largely unknown \\"smiling pope\\" like John Paul I. Only one man seemed to have the stature, the intellect, and the personality to fill, not only the shoes of the fisherman, but also the shoes of John Paul the Great: Joseph Ratzinger.<br /><br />All this is fascinating enough. But Allen's journalistic narrative-cum-biography does something very important -- something that I think makes this book itself very important. Joseph Ratzinger's reputation prior to his elevation wasn't the most positive in the American church. Nicknames like \\"God's rottweiler\\" were common. And although he barely mentions it in this book, Allen himself may bear some of the responsibility for this because of his scathing 1999 biography \\"Cardinal Ratzinger: The Vatican's Enforcer of the Faith\\" (a book from which Allen himself has since backed away).<br /><br />Allen here does an important service in showing that Benedict XVI is not in the least like his \\"enforcer\\" reputation -- a fact recognized by his brother cardinals when they elected him. According to cardinals Allen interviewed both before and after the conclave, Ratzinger is in fact a kind, thoughtful, even playful man who has a reputation for listening closely to those with whom he disagrees and conceding their arguments when he finds them to have merit. He is unwavering in his commitment to the truth, and believes there is no kindness or love in trimming or moderating the truth for those who may not want to hear it. But the image of him as a Vatican mafioso out to crack kneecaps just doesn't stand up to the testimony of those who know him.<br /><br />This is not a perfect book. For one thing, I hate hate hate that it doesn't have an index, nor any footnotes or other citations to differentiate his own interviews from information from other sources. And while Allen's portrait of the pope does include some of his warts, the tone of this book is so different from that of the author's earlier look at the man, I wish he would have included more discussion about why his opinion changed. I'm afraid Ratzinger's persistent critics will find it too easy to accuse Allen of \\"sucking up\\" to power. (I would find that accusation nonsense, myself, but I can imagine it being made.)<br /><br />On the whole, Allen paints a positive portrait of the new pontiff, and gives people inclined to like the man and willing to give him a chance many hopes for a great and important pontificate. Indeed, as Allen writes on pp. 179-180, \\"The great contribution of John Paul II, some confidants of Benedict XVI believe, was that he created such enormous interest in the papacy that the world will now be paying attention when Pope Benedict speaks. As one Belgian monsignor recently put the point, 'John Paul invited everyone to the feast, and now it's up to Benedict to cook the meal.'\\"whole, Allen paints a positive portrait of the new pontiff, and gives people inclined to like the man and willing to give him a chance many hopes for a great and important pontificate.

In the late 1950s, Jack Engeman set for himself a task for which he was very well suited. A professional photojournalist, retired Navy officer, and graduate of and former instructor at the Naval Academy, he decided to write a series of books illustrating the lives of cadets or midshipmen at the several federal service academies. Based on the examples I've seen from that series, he did a decent job. But this volume -- a companion piece about the lives of students at civilian colleges -- addressed a much bigger task. I don't think he pulled it off so well.<br /><br />The problem, of course, is that the lives of cadets or midshipmen are regulated along standardized lines, and thus relatively easy to describe. But even in the Eisenhower 1950s, the variety of college experiences available was too great to really capture in one 120-page book. Engeman sort of acknowledges this in his text, and made a fine effort to include photos from a pretty wide variety of schools (the picture index at the end reveals entries ranging from Michigan and Wisconsin, to the Ivies, through other northeastern schools like Sarah Lawrence and Colby, to small schools like Franklin & Marshall or Hood College; the south and west are less well represented). There are lots of pictures of well-dressed young people sitting around in libraries, walking past scenic buildings, or trying on their freshman beanies(!). But it's pretty hard to extrapolate it to describe \\"the life\\" of any typical college student.<br /><br />I realize, of course, that no student thinking about going to college will turn to this book from 1959 to help her make up her mind. So it hardly matters any more how effective a job Engeman did. Strictly as a collection of photos illustrating collegiate life in the late 1950s, though, it still may have some entertainment -- and even reference -- value.	2005-07-26

In the dustjacket biographical blurb, it says that in talking to students at Annapolis, West Point, and the Coast Guard Academy, photographer and author Jack Engeman \\"made the surprising discovery that although there were many histories of the academies, there were no candid accounts of the daily activities -- what it is actually like to be a cadet or a midshipman.\\" My own diligent search seems to suggest that at least so far as the USCGA is concerned, that surprising gap has re-formed in the years since this book was published. That makes it, dated as it is, by default about the best in the field.<br /><br />Jack Engeman is (was?) not only a skilled professional photojournalist, he's also an Annapolis graduate, a retired naval officer, and a former instructor at the Naval Academy. So you'd expect him to have a definite sympathy for, and instinctive understanding of, the life of a cadet or midshipman. And it seems he does. Unfortunately, his collection of images, well-chosen as they are, don't really explain the day-to-day life of a USCGA cadet ... certainly not the way excellent prose accounts like David Lipsky's \\"Absolutely American: Four Years at West Point\\" (Houghton Mifflin, 2003) did for the Hudson River Vo-Tech. (Granted, Lipsky's access to West Point cadets was unprecedented. But even inferior works on life at the Point are more informative than nothing at all on life at New London.)<br /><br />But if the photos aren't quite as enlightening as the photographer-author hoped they'd be, they are still illustrative of *aspects* of Academy life circa 1957. They and the accompanying captions may answer some questions and even give a general flavor of the cadet experience. Since there don't appear to be many more contemporary alternatives, we have to take what we can get.	2005-07-25

But a closer look answers the question. Mel Bradford actually undertook for himself a pretty mammoth task: not only to tell who the Framers were, where they came from and what they did, but more importantly to analyze what they individually believed and what they were trying to achieve in Philadelphia that fateful summer.<br /><br />Discussions of the origins and drafting of the Constitution are all too frequently simplified to the point where we assume that everyone agreed on the basic issues involved, and gathered only to work out the details. In fact, as Bradford shows, that was hardly the case at all. The author did a magnificent job, in my opinion, sorting out the degrees and shades of political opinion across a much wider spectrum than, I think, is generally thought to have existed. From extreme nationalists like Hamilton, who would have abolished the separate states entirely if he could have, to the most ardent anti-federalists, Bradford has dug into the original sources, the journals, memoirs, and letters, and brought forward the evidence to support the portraits he has created.<br /><br />To respond to the reviewer who suggested the point of Bradford's work was to prove the Framers were all Christians bent on establishing a Christian government: I have to wonder how closely that reviewer really read this book. Bradford of course discusses many of the Framers' religious beliefs. In some cases, this is a necessary part of understanding their philosophical roots. It's also an inescapable part of biography, since many of the men were in fact active supporters of one or another branch of the Christian faith. But the very core of Bradford's argument is that the Constitution is nomocratic, not teleocratic. In other words (and in marked contrast, again, to most modern understandings), most of the Framers were not trying to shape or create a *novus ordo seclorum* at all, but rather (and simply) to lay out the rules by which a federal government would operate. Society would be left free to shape itself. Whether that shape was Christian or otherwise was a matter for people, families, and communities, not the government. Some of the men at the Convention may have had other plans, but they were kept from realizing them by the moderate majority of delegates.<br /><br />\\"Founding Fathers\\" is a short book, but there is an awful lot crammed into it. As a basic reference, I think it's an essential part of any shelf of books dedicated to America's founding. As an introduction to the larger philosophical issues with which the Founders were dealing, and the ways in which they tried to address them, it's a summary, and an invitation to further study, that's pretty hard to beat.a *novus ordo seclorum* at all, but rather (and simply) to lay out the rules by which a federal government would operate.

Around page 75, I decided maybe I should get back to work. It was a little past page 100 before I finally did.<br /><br />The next day -- today -- I finished the book. And what a ride it was.<br /><br />I haven't decided quite yet whether this is the best Tres Navarre book. But what I'm sure of is that it's much better than \\"Southtown,\\" which I found unsatisfying. Part of it may be that now I'm more used to Rick Riordan's shift to third-person narration, with only the chapters focusing on Tres' himself told in first person. As a result of this change, this story, like \\"Southtown,\\" has a lot less Tres in it than the earlier volumes did. And because Tres is such a well-drawn character, I missed that focus on him here like I did in \\"Southtown.\\"<br /><br />The difference is that \\"Mission Road\\" is a much stronger story than \\"Southtown,\\" and one that hits even closer to home for our hero. Whereas \\"Southtown\\" felt rushed and even a little superficial, \\"Mission Road\\" reminded me of \\"Cold Springs,\\" Riordan's non-Tres novel, in its intensity and (as the professional reviewers would say) blistering pace. Not having to frame everything from Tres' point of view has allowed Riordan to create an especially powerful story -- one that gets right down to business and moves very quickly. No wonder I was so drawn in.<br /><br />There's one other thing I really like about the Tres Navarre stories. Whereas some mystery series are like episodic TV shows, where once the problem-of-the-day is resolved, everything goes back to the *status quo ante*, these books aren't like that. Each novel has led to changes in Tres' life -- some relatively small, but others (as in \\"Southtown\\") quite significant. Without giving anything away, I think I can say the changes that happen in \\"Mission Road\\" are some of the biggest yet. While this book would be a good introduction to someone who's never read Rick Riordan before, I think people who have read all the previous books in the series will get a lot more emotional impact out of what happens here.<br /><br />\\"Southtown\\" left me unsatisfied and wanting more. \\"Mission Road\\" left me drained -- an unusual response for me -- but satisfied.

Within a few decades of the founding of Jamestown in 1607, the first Lee arrived in the Tidewater. For the next three centuries, more or less, the Lees were at or near the center of Virginia's -- and later America's -- history. For readers familiar only with Robert E. Lee, it may come as a shock to realize just how important his family was before and during the Revolution. But even for those for whom that's not a surprise, Paul Nagel's work is still richly rewarding.<br /><br />That's because \\"The Lees of Virginia\\" isn't really a composite biography of each individual member of the vast Lee family. Many of them do receive pretty thorough portraits, of course. But Nagel's main purpose is to chart the connections and relationships within the family, and to explore the influence of the family *as a* family.<br /><br />In so doing, he paints a fascinating picture of how characteristics and traits passed from generation to generation -- and how, just as importantly, subsequent generations learned from, and tried to do things differently than, their forebears. Perhaps the most interesting contrast here is between the erratic and debt-ridden \\"Light-Horse Harry\\" Lee and his son Robert Edward. R.E. Lee, in this analysis, comes across, frankly, as something of a moralistic prig, and one who more or less chained his daughters to their invalid mother's bedside.  Nowadays, it's not uncommon to say about someone, \\"Well, he came from a messed-up family.\\" I have more appreciation for Robert E. Lee's greatness, as well as his human failings, for seeing that he, too, came from a messed-up family.<br /><br />If I do have a complaint about this book, it might be that ending the narrative at R.E. Lee's death in 1870 seems a little arbitrary. Certainly, General Lee could be seen as the last truly great or influential member of the family. But as Nagel himself mentions, the General's sons and nephews continued to play relatively important roles in the history of Virginia, including service in Congress and as governor of the Commonwealth. Families wax and wane in their influence, as Nagel's book on the Adamses also proved. But I would have been willing to follow Nagel's reporting for another generation or two, just to see what happened.<br /><br />That aside, though, this is a fine book about an interesting family in interesting times. There are several members of the family I hope to find out more about -- especially Francis Lightfoot Lee, signer of the Declaration of Independence, whose relatively reclusive personality -- at least as contrasted to his more attention-seeking brothers -- was especially intriguing to me.

In fact, while Tom Brown and other highlights of school fiction do make an appearance in these pages, the bulk of the excerpts are from nonfiction sources.<br /><br />Taken together, the selections -- which range from the contemporary back to the 1600s -- paint a pretty comprehensive picture of the British school experience as captured in memoirs, poetry, essays, and other documents.<br /><br />The book is divided into sections focusing on various topics, including schoolmasters, fitting into the system, customs and traditions, and others. Contributions come from men and women, graduates of ancient and grand institutions, traditionless state facilities, and nondescript (and largely forgotten) schools of all sorts. Some readings are funny, some are harrowing, and pretty much all are interesting and well-written. Readers interested in contemporary education questions, the school in literature, memories of childhood, or other related topics will probably all find something worth checking out in these pages.	2005-07-11

Paul Johnson's [[ASIN:006075365X George Washington: The Founding Father (Eminent Lives)]] and Christopher Hitchens' essay on Thomas Jefferson are very different books. But each was in its own way remarkable. I think it's safe to say that this is a book that few readers will soon forget.<br /><br />As Hitchens notes early on, Jefferson was more than just a \\"man of contradictions.\\" He more or less embodied contradiction. Few writers, in my experience, are better equipped to identify contradictions, expose hypocrisies, and \\"call B.S.\\" when necessary, than Christopher Hitchens. He did it with (or to) Clinton, he did it with Kissinger, and it seems only right to have spent a few hours on this Fourth of July exploring with him the evolving ideas and motivations of Mr. Jefferson himself.<br /><br />Today, conservatives, libertarians, and leftists, Republicans and Democrats, anti-government \\"militias\\" and activist social-engineer types all claim Jefferson as one of their own. And each does so with some justice. Hitchens does an excellent job of walking through Jefferson's shifting opinions on questions like the proper powers of government, centralization versus \\"states' rights\\", the necessity of revolution, international relations, and much more. This is far from a comprehensive biography of Jefferson, and it certainly lacks the Olympian objectivity we get from most modern biographers. Hitchens has strong opinions, especially about religion, and he's not in the least hesitant about making those part of his discussion. Unlike another reviewer I wouldn't recommend this title for someone who has never read much about Jefferson before. But given Hitchens' keen eye and sharp pen, I think it certainly ranks among the best *interpretations* of Jefferson I've yet seen.	2005-07-04

It's not a perfect book -- though not for the reasons many negative reviewers give. But as a presentation of the case against one of the two or three worst and most destructive presidents of the twentieth century, it's a pretty good start.<br /><br />Like [[ASIN:140005477X FDR's Folly: How Roosevelt and His New Deal Prolonged the Great Depression]], Jim Powell's book about another president of inflated reputation, \\"Wilson's War\\" doesn't break a lot of new ground. What both books do, however, is the very important work of assembling facts and making connections that many historians and opinion leaders are all too interested in glossing over or explaining away.<br /><br />Jim Powell is hardly the first person make these arguments. Personally, I had already come to largely the same conclusion Powell does from reading Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn's [[ASIN:0895265370 Leftism Revisited: From De Sade and Marx to Hitler and Pol Pot]], Thomas Fleming's essential [[ASIN:0465024696 The Illusion Of Victory: America In World War I]] (Basic Books, 2003), and various histories of the rise of the National Socialists. Combine that with other books about the rise of the International Socialists, like Robert Service's [[ASIN:0674003306 Lenin: A Biography]] and Robert Conquest's histories of the USSR (both authors are quoted extensively in \\"Wilson's War\\"), and it gets pretty hard credibly to accuse Powell of flying off by himself someplace.<br /><br />Where this book left me dissatisfied was in its balance in presenting causes and consequences. Powell does vital work in spelling out the horrors attendant to the red revolutions of 1917 and 1933. But I wish he had gone into still more depth presenting Wilson's dangerous combination of self-righteousness and ignorance, and how the messianic (in his own mind) Wilson was swung like a lariat by cleverer politicians both manipulating and being driven by nationalistic passions. It's easy to dismiss Powell by saying he hangs his argument on too slender a thread. Personally, I would have encouraged Powell to reduce the second half of the book by about fifty percent, and to double the length of the argument in the first half.<br /><br />But that question of causes and consequences notwithstanding, \\"Wilson's War\\" makes an important argument. By questioning the premises on which American foreign policy has been based for the last four or five score years (certainly, Walter Hines Page telling Sir Edward Grey in 1913 that the US \\"will be here for two hundred years and it can continue to shoot men [in Mexico] until they learn to vote and to rule themselves\\" is an impressively twenty-first century view of American statesmanship), Powell guaranteed himself a rough reception from establishment historians and reviewers. But as I never tire of quoting K-L saying, the judgment of historians and the judgment of history are two very different things.

Personally, I would argue that George Washington is the standard against which American greatness has to be judged. And similarly, this thin volume by Paul Johnson has set a standard against which future portraits of the man should be measured.<br /><br />Washington's life was a monumental one, and so it naturally attracts monumental biographies -- from Freeman's seven volume work, Clark's two-volume [[ASIN:B000I9O202 All Cloudless Glory: the Life of George Washington]] or Joseph Ellis' recent and hefty [[ASIN:1400032539 His Excellency: George Washington]]. Summing up the man in barely 100 pages, as Johnson (himself no stranger to weighty tomes) has done, is a far more challenging, and necessarily more selective, undertaking. It would be easy to come up with a list of things Johnson \\"should have\\" included or \\"ought to have\\" covered in more depth. But within the confines of the Eminent Lives series, Johnson has done a magnificent job focusing on the essentials of the man and his impact on his world and ours.<br /><br />Despite the brevity of the book, Washington comes through strongly as a flesh and blood man, not an ivory god. Far from the Olympian reserve Washington himself cultivated, Johnson shows how the man was clever, opinionated, sometimes self-seeking, sometimes hypocritical, and simultaneously revered and underestimated by those around him. I found the latter stages of the book especially interesting, as Johnson charted Washington's influence on the new government under the Constitution, and Washington's own efforts in promotion of a strong, centralized government. The American presidency, today and for some time the most powerful post in the world, is an office shaped for, indeed designed in the image of, George Washington. Johnson makes a case that the strong powers later exercised by presidents like Jackson and Lincoln were not usurpations, but rather honest interpretations of powers the Framers intended Washington to have.<br /><br />In my experience, pocket-sized biographies like this series and the similar Penguin Lives series can vary greatly in quality from volume to volume. This is the first Eminent Lives edition I've read ([[ASIN:0060598964 Thomas Jefferson: Author of America (Eminent Lives)]] by Christopher Hitchens comes next), and the series is, for me, off to a wonderful start. Johnson has packed an awful lot into one slim book, and has put to shame many more verbose but less instructive views of the same subject.

Bradford and His Achievements	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Wonderful overview of a multi-faceted intellect	In many years of reading about the American Founding, the history and culture of the South, and conservative politics, I kept encountering the name M.E. Bradford. But apart from reading the occasional article, I had neglected to pay him much attention. But that is an oversight I am definitely going to work on repairing, now that I have completed this thorough look at the man's work and influence.<br /><br />Mel Bradford was both a student of the Southern Agrarians and perhaps the definitive expositor of their view. By interest and vocation, his mind explored history and politics, but also literature and poetry, from the ancients to the most contemporary. The essays in this collection cover similar ground, analyzing Bradford, his work, the influences that shaped him, and his own influence, across a variety of disciplines. Generally sympathetic but not uncritical where criticism is warranted, the nine contributions here pack a lot of insight and information into a relatively few pages. And like so many of the books I seem to enjoy best, it produced a long list of additional books to add to my must-read list -- Bradford's own, most obviously, but many others as well.<br /><br />The influence of the Southern Agrarians on history was admittedly slight, and Bradford's own lasting significance is open to debate. What's blessedly clear, however, is that he and his legacy have not yet been eclipsed. The fight over Bradford's nomination to head the National Endowment for the Humanities early in the Reagan Administration was one of the earliest fault lines in the much-discussed \\"conservative crackup,\\" and an early milestone in the neocon ascendancy. That ascendancy is far from absolute, however, and heat is still rising from the cracks and fissures. This book serves as a useful reminder of the issues at stake there, too.<br /><br />Mostly, however, \\"A Defender of Southern Conservatism\\" is a fine testimonial to an influential scholar and an admirable gentleman. It's definitely inspired me to dig more deeply into his life and work, and I expect other readers shall have the same reaction.itely inspired me to dig more deeply into his life and work, and I expect other readers shall have the same reaction.	2005-06-20

Readers looking for English-language resources on Benedict XV don't have a lot of alternatives. Fortunately, one resource they do have -- this book by John F. Pollard -- is a very good one.<br /><br />That said, I don't think all readers will find this biography equally satisfying. I happen to be (finally) getting around to reading David McCullough's massive biography of John Adams, and the contrast between the two is great. Unlike the current trend in popular bios, of which \\"John Adams\\" is a good example, \\"The Unknown Pope\\" is not really a deep personal and psychological exploration of Giacomo Della Chiesa. A mention toward the end of the book of his \\"besetting sin\\" of irascibility came as a bit of a surprise, for example, because Pollard hadn't really emphasized that sort of personal portraiture before. Likewise, a discussion of Benedict in his role as governor of the Roman Catholic Church and his devotion to the Sacred Heart take up only a few pages in the final chapter, although they were evidently a pretty significant part of the man's own life. So I think it's fair to say that readers may come away from \\"The Unknown Pope\\" with Benedict XV remaining somewhat of an unknown pope -- at least by, as I say, the standards of current personality-driven biography.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I still argue this is a fine work of history.  Pollard does an excellent job of placing Benedict XV in his historical context with a particular emphasis, as the subtitle says, on \\"the pursuit of peace.\\" Benedict deserves to be remembered as the man who, more than perhaps anyone else, tried to end World War I in a way that prevented slaughter and national humiliation. The fact that he singularly failed to do so is hardly due to his lack of honest and intensive effort. Perhaps also forgotten these days is Benedict's role in restoring peace to the church after the anti-Modernist purge overseen by his predecessor Pius X. If the current pope is intending to work for peace in the world and harmony within his Church, he couldn't have chosen a better namesake. Pollard gives us a fine overview of all of this, with an emphasis on the tightrope Benedict was walking, given the uncertain diplomatic and political status of the Holy See at the time. Readers without a grounding in Vatican history of a century ago (readers like me) may be surprised by the large role Italian politics plays in this story. Here too, Pollard does a good job cutting through a pretty complex knot in a way most general readers should be able to handle.<br /><br />Personally, I've admired Benedict XV for some time for his efforts to end the Great War, though admittedly my knowledge of the man was pretty sketchy. Even without this volume being an intensely personal look at a private and apparently somewhat introverted man, \\"The Unknown Pope\\" helps rescue him from an obscurity he certainly does not deserve. If Benedict XVI truly sees Benedict XV as someone to emulate, then the Church and the world should be in for some interesting years ahead.

A partisan of neither the traditional interpretations of Texas history nor of the newer \\"revisionist\\" narrative that explains the events of the 1830s as nothing but a race war, Crisp dives deep into some critical primary sources, showing how they have been largely misinterpreted throughout the dialectical debate. Facts may be immutable things, but it's the historian's job to weave them into a narrative (p. 183) and to deliver that narrative to a broader public (p. 188). Facts can only be understood in that broader context. And when our context changes, so too must our narrative. In that sense, this little volume sets off some pretty big explosions in the way Texan history should be understood.<br /><br />But more than just a great work of history, this is also a memoir that ranks with Martin Gilbert's [[ASIN:B000VZL0M6 In Search of Churchill - A Historian's Journey]] as a sterling example of how a fine historian does his job. In contrast to those who think history can ever be a \\"nailed-shut\\" case (Henry Clausen and his [[ASIN:0306810352 Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement]] come to mind), Crisp displays the curiosity, perseverance, skills -- I'm shocked to discover there are apparently serious writers on early Texas history who can't read Spanish -- and skepticism that kept him digging deeper into the historical record.<br /><br />This is a fascinating work of history that, to use the obvious and inevitable comparison, is as interesting and exciting as a well-crafted detective story. But it's also a wonderful example of how the historian's work should be performed. For that reason, I would heartily recommend this book, not only to students of the Texas revolution, but to anyone interested in the theory and practice of historiography.	2005-05-24

In the last six weeks or so, I've read a whole raft of books about papal elections. Some were decent, if dated, summaries. A few were full of strong feelings and distinctive language. A couple were worth remembering, while others dissipated as quickly as the white smoke from the Sistine Chapel itself. But out of them all, it turns out I saved the best for last: John-Peter Pham's \\"Heirs of the Fisherman.\\"<br /><br />At first glace, this book seems a lot like the rest. Even the organization and structure is remarkably similar to many of the others: a quick review of the history of papal elections; a focus on the conclaves of the twentieth century; a look at the new conclave rules introduced by John Paul II in \\"Universi Dominici gregis\\"; a rundown of the \\"grand electors,\\" or Cardinals most likely to be influential in the then-expected conclave; and finally, thumbnail portraits of the leading *papabile,* circa 2004. None of this is particularly exceptional.<br /><br />What raised this book in my estimation above the previous frontrunner (John L. Allen's \\"Conclave\\") is John-Peter Pham's general skill, not just as an explainer of church arcana, but as a historian and also as a writer. Allen's guide is a workmanlike book by a skilled journalist. Pham's, on the other hand, reads like a work of history. Allen's is a great survey, and good for the generalist or the person with a casual interest. Pham's is a wealth of insight and analysis with an unusual blend of theology, personality, and even political science added to the mix. I found Allen's book informative and fairly easy to read. Pham's took more effort to absorb, but was fascinating and even entertaining.<br /><br />Now that the event for which most of these books were prepared has passed, they'll go back on the shelves and start gathering dust. God willing, authors will have plenty of time to prepare a new collection along the same lines before the next conclave.

Fascinated as I was by the apparent wealth of information and documentation in these pages, I needed an asbestos bookmark to survive the heat of Allen's judgment of the man.<br /><br />I am therefore most indebted to other reviewers on this page who report news I apparently missed, that Allen has backed away from this book and its lack of \\"sober analysis.\\" It's good to see that the insightful, balanced, Allen of his later works is the true man, and my respect for him rises still further for his honesty in admitting that things got a little out of control the first time around.<br /><br />Still, I would argue that this book is still worth a read because not all of Ratzinger's critics have made the same journey. \\"Cardinal Ratzinger\\" not only transmits Allen's own strong feelings at the time, but the judgments of many others throughout the length of Joseph Ratzinger's long career. Allen may have changed his mind, but he's just one (albeit prominent) man; the criticisms leveled here -- to say nothing of the invectives hurled by others -- aren't going away. Allen's new bio will no doubt be a far better book. But if you want to experience at least some of the strong feelings Benedict XVI and his pre-elevation legacy have generated, this may still be a worthwhile place to start.<br /><br />Just bring your awareness of how the author's opinions have matured, and a good pair of oven mitts.	2005-05-11

Andrew Greeley and the generally more respected journalist John L. Allen. There were a number of \\"quickie\\" books produced before the late pontiff's death too, and in the wake of the last month's events their time has largely come and gone. That's definitely the case with \\"Selecting the Pope\\" by Greg Tobin.<br /><br />Produced in 2003, which even then was apparently considered \\"the waning days of a pontificate\\" (p. viii), this book gives a rapid thumbnail portrait of the history and roles of the papacy, the various methods of papal election over the centuries, former and current curial law concerning the process, and \\"the challenges awaiting the next pope.\\" If that seems like a lot of ground to cover in just over 100 pages, you're right. In fact, if you were or still are interested in more than the most cursory overview of these questions, there are significantly more in-depth references than this one. Personally, I would start by pointing you to the works of the aforementioned John L. Allen.<br /><br />As a whirlwind guide to the processes to be used (or, that were used) in the election of the pope to follow John Paul II, this is an adequate though far from exceptional resource. There's nothing especially wrong here, and if all you're looking for is a rapid explanation of what happened and why, this is a good enough place to start. It's definitely a fairly quick read (and probably didn't take too long to write, either).<br /><br />But for insight as to what was going to happen behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, however, all I can do is point out the following, from pages 114-115:<br /><br />\\"A curial cardinal is, almost by definition, not *papabile.* Although Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith -- which used to be the Holy Office, and before that the Inquisition -- is a highly regarded theologian and intellectual, he is one of the least likely to be elected pope.\\"<br /><br />Oh well.ith -- which used to be the Holy Office, and before that the Inquisition -- is a highly regarded theologian and intellectual, he is one of the least likely to be elected pope.\\" <br /> <br />Oh well.	2005-04-26

As John L. Allen's \\"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election\\" (2002) rendered Hebblethwaite's \\"The Next Pope\\" (1995, 2000) largely redundant, so too has Allen's \\"All the Pope's Men\\" (2004), among other titles, surpassed \\"In the Vatican\\" as a view to how the Holy See is structured and why it operates the way it does.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a nuts-and-bolts gazetteer of Vatican forms and functions, I'd recommend you go elsewhere.<br /><br />That's not to say, however, that \\"In the Vatican\\" isn't worth reading.  Both in content and in expression, Hebblethwaite has a flair that really stands out.<br /><br />Reading Peter Hebblethwaite, in fact, reminds me a lot of reading Christopher Hitchens -- in style, I hasten to note, not substance. Hebblethwaite described himself as a devout Catholic, and clearly has respect for the Church. You'd be hard pressed to find anything similar in Hitch's writings on the Church, notably his valediction for the late Pope John Paul II. Hebblethwaite is polemical and has a definite point of view, one solidly on the liberal side of the spectrum (at one point, he compares Opus Dei to the Moonies). This book isn't a quick and easy just-the-facts read. But I found it definitely worth the effort.<br /><br />After a quick historical survey and a probe inside \\"The Mind of Karol Wojtyla\\" (though I liked his summary of the late pope's thought in \\"The Next Pope\\" somewhat better), Hebblethwaite leads us through the structure of the Holy See, generally with one chapter per dicastery. He doesn't pull many punches, it seems to me, in the picture he paints, but to this outsider, at least, his arguments sounded reasonable and neither spiteful nor ad hominem. Given the election of Pope Benedict XVI, Hebblethwaite's look at the former Cardinal Ratzinger and his custody of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith was especially interesting.<br /><br />In the final chapter, Hebblethwaite switches voices and presents the inaugural address of a fictional Pope Benedict XVI (really!) at the opening session of a new Church council, which he calls Lateran VI. Here the author clearly presents his own case for the changes, redirections, and reforms he believes the Church needs. None of these are especially surprising 200 pages into this book, but it's still an interesting rhetorical presentation (and entertaining, too -- especially the fictional pope's passing reference to \\"the late lamented Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger whose unaccountable breakdown was such a tragedy\\").<br /><br />I'm sure Hebblethwaite is not to everyone's taste, either in style or content. But I found him both well-informed and with an arresting personal style. His reputation as an eminent Vatican-watcher is nowhere more apparent than in these pages, and it's clear why he seems to have been so respected by so many writers on things papal.m.

None of these are especially surprising 200 pages into this book, but it's still an interesting rhetorical presentation (and entertaining, too -- especially the fictional pope's passing reference to \\"the late lamented Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger whose unaccountable breakdown was such a tragedy\\"). <br /> <br />I'm sure Hebblethwaite is not to everyone's taste, either in style or content. But I found him both well-informed and with an arresting personal style. His reputation as an eminent Vatican-watcher is nowhere more apparent than in these pages, and it's clear why he seems to have been so respected by so many writers on things papal. <br />	2005-04-20

But if you can't manage to track down a copy of \\"Democracy Revisited,\\" don't worry: if you own \\"Leftism Revisited,\\" \\"Liberty or Equality,\\" or best of all, both, you already have all the arguments, examples, pithy statements, and even generous footnoting you'll encounter here.<br /><br />K-L's beliefs about the nature of democracy, especially as contrasted with liberalism (\\"properly understood\\") are the centerpiece of this brochure. He traces the origin of the term, the development of the *regimen mixtum* during \\"the Christian centuries,\\" and the decline of democracy into national and international socialism. The practical irrelevance of the individual voter is highlighted, in contrast to the centrality of the individual in Christian thought: \\"The fact that human beings are persons and, therefore, unique and irreplaceable, is studiously overlooked [in mass democracy]. If democracy were anything like 'self-government,' then it should not be forgotten that human beings are not *algebraic* units and that they cannot be 'added.' A plus B plus C always remains A plus B plus C, and does not 'add up' to 3.\\" (As K-L memorably summarized elsewhere, \\"'We' is from the Devil. 'I' is from God.\\")<br /><br />Next comes a summary of the growing gap between the knowledge necessary to maintain effective governance versus the actual knowledge of the population, the lack of intellectual qualifications for political office (and indeed for voting), and the higher time preference of democratic leaders relative to monarchs with a thought to long-term preservation of their patriarchy. After a survey -- and rejection -- of the idea that democracy is \\"more modern\\" than monarchy, K-L closes with a call to defend freedom by refusing to allow it to be absorbed \\"under the protection of pseudo-religious, anti-rational political forms and structures.\\"<br /><br />Anyone familiar with K-L's other writings will recognize that there is little especially new in this outline. He did include a few contemporary references, and this isn't strictly a cut-and-paste from one of his books, so it's still worth the reading. And as an introductory summary of K-L for someone who isn't interested in reading all of \\"Leftism Revisited\\" (though they should be!), it might be a nice resource to have around. This is a small drop in the vast sea of Kuehnelt-Leddihn's work. But to paraphrase Solzhenitsyn, this one drop gives a pretty good taste of the ocean.otection of pseudo-religious, anti-rational political forms and structures.\\"    Anyone familiar with K-L's other writings will recognize that there is little especially new in this outline.

Though it's an easy journalistic shorthand, saying \\"the Vatican decided...\\" is ultimately no more accurate than saying \\"the Administration announced today.\\" The Curia is made up of individuals with a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences, and (to a degree) motivations. Allen probably knows the ins and outs of the Holy See better than any working American journalist, and is an excellent, and sympathetic, guide.<br /><br />But it's the book's second purpose that makes this especially valuable. Allen argues that on issues like the sex-abuse scandal and the Holy See's opposition to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the Vatican and American Catholics were by-and-large speaking past, not to, one another. This is because the two sides have some fundamental misunderstandings about the other, and are driven as much, or more, by their own mistaken assumptions than by a true understanding of with whom they are dealing. In this volume, Allen tries to explain why the Vatican thinks the way it does (or more correctly, why the people in the Vatican think they way they do), and what influences and assumptions are brought to bear when addressing issues relevant to the future of the Church.<br /><br />Allen's goal is not to convert the reader to a particular conclusion, or to convince anyone that one position or the other is \\"right\\" on any particular dispute. Though Allen is often classified as on the moderate-to-liberal side of Church politics and issues, I found little to suggest he was pushing any agenda of his own here. His focus is on placing the Vatican and its people in social, political, theological, and even geographical contexts. It made for fascinating and enlightening reading, personally, and I believe any reader who approaches this book with a desire to learn and understand may come away with the same reaction.elieve any reader who approaches this book with a desire to learn and understand may come away with the same reaction.	2005-04-19

289979:US	53058008	RMR1GRLPURWYZ	0025882201	29768258	The Vicar of Christ	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Not a perfect novel, but one that has stuck with me	I read this book probably 15 or even 20 years ago. And while for a long time I had completely forgotten the title, the work itself was fairly memorable. Now that papal elections and church politics are once again in the news, it could be worth the effort to track this novel down if the papal-fiction genre appeals to you.<br /><br />As other reviewers have described, the most interesting feature of this book is the way in which the story is told. Declan Walsh's story is narrated through the eyes of three different observers in the three key portions of his life: the Korean War, the US Supreme Court, and the Vatican. The portraits of the three men telling the story are in many ways as interesting as Walsh's own. The hard-bitten gunny sergeant, the aristocratic and world-weary associate justice, and the epicurean Prince of the Church all bring their own prejudices, assumptions, and interpretations to the story.<br /><br />For a long time, I was disappointed with the direction this novel took in its final sections. Without giving any of the story away, I'll note that things take a turn for the supernatural. I used to consider this a *deus ex machina* cop-out on the author's part. But now I wonder whether this wasn't part of the \\"Rashomon\\"-like nature of the story: did things \\"really\\" happen the way they were related by the narrator? Or does the reader need to do some interpretation for herself? Maybe it's time to pick up the novel again.<br /><br />At any rate, I give this three stars because I consider it a journeyman effort. Interesting -- and, as I say, memorable -- in some of its elements, but not one of the Great Novels of the Late Twentieth Century. If you come across a copy, it may be worth taking the time to read. But if you don't, I imagine you'll get along just fine.	2005-04-04

As a general overview, I heartily endorse the review posted below by Nathaniel Avignon. However, now that the event for which this book was prepared is upon us, I would add a few points.<br /><br />Allen's overview of the process and personalities of Conclave strikes this non-Catholic reader as a remarkably thorough one, and a valuable resource to keep by your television and newspaper in the coming weeks (especially since Allen himself will be showing up as a commentator on Fox News). As they say at the ball games, you can't tell the players without a program, and \\"Conclave\\" does a fine job in explaining both the curial offices (camerlengo, Vicar of Rome, etc.) and the specific roles they play in the period from the death of the old pope to the election of the new one.<br /><br />Allen includes profiles of most of the leading *papabiles* and capsule biographies of nearly every other eligible Cardinal, circa 2002. Because the book is a couple of years old, some of the information is slightly outdated. By and large, however, the names in Allen's books are the names in today's newspapers.<br /><br />I've read a number of books about papal history, conclaves, and \\"inside the Vatican\\" expos&eacute;s over the years, and plan to read one or two more in the next few weeks. But few have exposed the inner workings, the implicit (and sometimes even explicit) political and theological groupings, in the way this title has. If you're looking for a title that makes the whole historic, secretive, but incredibly interesting process now unfolding somewhat more transparent, \\"Conclave\\" by John Allen strikes me as a very hard book to beat.	2005-04-04

Popes are chosen, only to die quickly -- sometimes in the very next sentence. So this is not in any sense a history of the papacy. The author has focused his attention quite narrowly, and for general readers looking for an introduction to this interesting and timely topic, he has succeeded admirably.<br /><br />Walsh's text emphasizes the changing dynamics involved in papal elections over the centuries, including the waxing and waning of various political and popular influences. Although Church doctrine says the Holy Spirit chooses the next Bishop of Rome (and the machinations of plotters have often been defeated in surprising ways), more earthly and secular powers have had big roles to play too. Though it's not always easy to decipher the backroom politicking or strong-arming, the author has sorted facts and speculation into a very readable history. Though specialist historians will no doubt be left wanting something more in-depth, and I for one deeply regretted the absence of an index, most general readers will probably find this gives them a good comprehensive overview.	2005-04-01

As celebrated author Antony Preston notes in his introduction, the question of warship design can easily sound like a boring backwater of naval history. This is especially true once it becomes clear that this book isn't like those \\"world's strangest airplanes\\" programs that sometimes show up on TV, with whimsical designs being \\"flown\\" off ramps to drop straight into the sea.<br /><br />But this book is actually quite interesting, and filled with Important Lessons for people interested in learning them. The failures of these \\"world's worst warships\\" aren't due solely to the shortsightedness of naval architects or the incompetence of shipbuilders. Far more destructive, in fact, are wrongheaded admirals, penny-pinching politicians, pushy civilians with connections, and the recurrent danger of \\"fighting the last war.\\" Though many of the ship designs listed here could be considered honest-but-failed experiments in new ideas, quite a few of them qualify as among the \\"world's worst\\" because of their designers' or champions' refusal to learn the lessons that should have already been apparent to them.<br /><br />I can easily imagine this book touching off among naval officers and historians the kinds of impassioned debates that lists of All-Century football teams do among sports fans. Do famous names like \\"Bismarck,\\" \\"Yamato,\\" or the American \\"four-stacker\\" destroyers of the mid-War era really belong among the world's worst? Preston makes a strong -- well-sourced, well-argued, and even entertaining -- case that they do. What do you think?	2005-03-28

By dusting off an understanding of American history that our betters believed dead and buried, Woods is doing nothing less than calling into question the philosophical foundation of the American State as it exists today. No wonder so many people hate him.<br /><br />For all the mind-altering (or \\"paradigm-shifting\\") ideas it introduces, \\"The Politically Incorrect Guide\\" is an easy and frequently entertaining read. While entirely appropriate for adults, the Guide would make an excellent history text for (speaking of objects of Establishment hate) home-schoolers of most any age. The suggestions for additional reading are well-chosen and insightful, and would themselves make great additions to anyone's bookshelves.<br /><br />I have to admire Woods for being willing to open himself up for attack by writing and publishing this book. He had to have known he would get steamrolled. I hope the success his book is enjoying is psychological as well as financial compensation for him. It shows the American people haven't entirely bought into the Revised Standard understanding of America's past just yet. This is a book that deserves to be read, remembered, and passed along to others. History will always be interpreted and reinterpreted for political purposes. But facts remain facts, and individuals have the right and the responsibility to make up their own minds.the success his book is enjoying is psychological as well as financial compensation for him.

Ah, for the good old days, when socialism was on the march around the world, \\"respectable opinion\\" was defined by two newspapers and three TV networks, and those nasty right-wingers were confined to one fortnightly magazine. The left isn't mourning the lack of \\"intelligent discussion\\" -- they're incensed that conservatives aren't playing along any more. As the old French proverb has it, \\"truth alone offends.\\"<br /><br />In this new world, Ann Coulter is a wonderful sign of how things have changed. Sure, she argues with an aluminum baseball bat, not a rapier, and sometimes she makes up in vitriol what she lacks in precision. And as I've noted in reviews of her other books, she's often better at identifying problems than offering solutions. But these days, even defining problems correctly is a challenge for many people. Ann Coulter's skills are particularly appreciated.<br /><br />There were a few sections of this book that particularly appealed to me. As a once-upon-a-time Libertarian Party candidate for office, I enjoyed her discussions with the LP of Connecticut about a possible run against Chris Shays. Her identification of the LP's central problems was right-on in my opinion, as was her declaration (quoting from memory) that \\"of course I'll support the legalization of drugs ... right after we abolish the department of agriculture, the social security administration, the internal revenue service, the department of transportation, the department of health and human services, the department of energy, the national endowment for the arts...\\" And as a resident of Washington, still at this writing sitting through court case after court case following recount after recount in our governor's race, it was particularly timely to hear her discussion of the 2000 Florida recount and subsequent Supreme Court case. It is indubitably true that the left doesn't want accurate vote counts: they want vote counts that declare *them* the winners.<br /><br />But most instructive, in the general theme of \\"how to talk to (or about) a liberal\\" was Coulter's *absolute refusal* to be misquoted, or have her argument mis-stated, in the furball over former senator Max Cleland, his injuries, and his unsuccessful re-election attempt. The same with the case of the Central Park Jogger and the allegedly \\"new\\" evidence that \\"cast doubt\\" on the identity of her attackers. As blogger Kim du Toit wrote recently on a similar subject, there can be no \\"rational discourse\\" when there are no shared assumptions. Ann Coulter's most grievous crime is that she gleefully and mercilessly cudgels the Received Wisdom of people who believe they're more virtuous than the rest of us because they want to take our money, limit our property rights, render us less safe, drive our businesses into the ground, and do it all \\"for the children.\\"<br /><br />God bless her for it.subsequent Supreme Court case.

But this is the first of his books where entire sections left me thinking, \\"Huh?\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the clearest way to describe the book is to use the first two sentences of K-L's own introduction: \\"This volume deals with a series of questions that have come to light in the Church in recent years. These questions, although often having roots that touch eternal values, are always conditioned by their own time.\\" Not being, as I said, a Catholic, nor much involved in theological questions circa 1969, I'm sure I brought less to this book than K-L presumed his typical reader would.<br /><br />That's not to say this book is too mired in its own time to be of any value today, or so \\"Catholic\\" as to be opaque to the non-Catholic reader. On the contrary, I found the author's discussion of monasticism, religious and secular, particularly interesting, and his subsequent chapter on \\"The Christian Social Romantics\\" especially timely. Indeed, although she isn't Catholic, the description of the Christian social romantic brought to mind nobody so strongly as Hillary Rodham Clinton, a woman strongly motivated by her United Methodist upbringing and theologically-formed sense of \\"social justice.\\" That was probably my most heavily annotated chapter of the book.<br /><br />After that, however, things got more confusing for me, as K-L dealt with the issue of \\"pluralism\\" in the Church and in society. Drawing on the Thomistic argument, familiar to readers of other K-L books, that \\"all positive forms of the state have corresponding negative forms of decline\\" (monarchy-autocracy; aristocracy-plutocracy; republicanism-democracy), he contrasts pluralism and integralism with \\"plurism\\" and \\"integrism\\" to show what kinds of unity, and what kinds of variety, are good or bad for the Church. My confusion may have been semantic as much as anything else, but this chapter in particular is one where I admit to having great difficulty understanding the point K-L was making.<br /><br />Though still filled with political and social observation, \\"The Timeless Christian\\" is much more theological and even spiritual than \\"Liberty or Equality\\" or \\"Leftism Revisited.\\" Even as a non-Catholic, I found many thought-provoking ideas, noteworthy turns of phrase, and (per usual for K-L) more than a few counterintuitive arguments. Most important of all, though, may have been the idea behind the title itself -- the reminder that \\"Christians confined in corsets will never master the times in which they live; and this they must do. They must master, overmaster, and mould their times, but never accommodate themselves to them.\\"he contrasts pluralism and integralism with \\"plurism\\" and \\"integrism\\" to show what kinds of unity, and what kinds of variety, are good or bad for the Church.

The sad irony is that while the sanctimonious, mean-spirited, and easily-deceived Wilson is still widely revered by many people who should know better, so too is the sanctimonious, mean-spirited, and easily-deceived \\"statesman\\" James Earl Carter.<br /><br />Ironic, because as Steven Hayward notes in both his first chapter and his acknowledgements, Carter's personal flaws were widely known at the time of his campaign for the presidency, and his political failings were self-evident by the time the American people definitively turned their backs on him in 1980. In this excellent short book, Hayward doesn't break a lot of new ground. What he does do is assemble for a new era the facts surrounding the man PJ O'Rourke once called \\"the most 'ex' of our ex-presidents.\\"<br /><br />Hayward's language is strong, but his subject clearly deserves it (and should expect it, given his demonstrated eagerness to hurl invective as his own opponents). Importantly, this book is not -- despite some reviewers' accusations -- a partisan screed. Hayward's sources are largely mainstream news reports, biographies, and memoirs, including many from former Carter staffers. Some of the most damning quotes come from Tip O'Neill, Joe Califano, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and the editorial page of The Washington Post -- none of which can sanely be categorized as \\"right-wing.\\"<br /><br />Carter's current reputation, among people who aren't paying attention, as a good-hearted charity home-builder who cares about human rights and clean elections camouflages the real man: a man who is, in Moynihan's devastating appraisal, \\"unable to distinguish between our friends and our enemies, [and who] has adopted our enemies' view of the world\\" (p. 109). Fortunately, Hayward has chapter and verse of Carter's systematic embrace of terrorists, communists, and anti-American strongmen. His documentation is thorough. Carter and his defenders do have things they ought to be made to answer for. (And who can be surprised that, according to recent headlines, Carter appears to be caught up in the UN Oil-for-Food scandal too?)<br /><br />Strong as Hayward's case is, this is a book that could have been much longer and even more detailed. I wish it had been. Perhaps -- given the subtitle's mention of John Kerry -- the hope was to get the book into print before the 2004 election. The story of how Carter helped wrest control of the Democratic Party away from the likes of Henry \\"Scoop\\" Jackson and had it over to the McGovernite appeasers is an important one, and deserves further development. Certainly Moynihan's 1980 election post-mortem that voters saw in Carter's party a group of people who believed \\"government should be strong and America should be weak\\" is still an accurate characterization of the Dems today.<br /><br />With its strong mix of history, current events, and long-overdue \\"revisionism\\" of a vastly inflated reputation, \\"The Real Jimmy Carter\\" is a book that deserves to be widely read., [and who] has adopted our enemies' view of the world\\" (p. 109).

His chapters here on Israel and Egypt, especially, are both entertaining and insightful. But I've always thought PJ's greatest strength was his ability to see through and deflate the hypocrisy and BS of the Left. His brief chapter \\"Nobel Pretensions\\" and his reporting on Leftist demonstrations in Washington, D.C., are fine examples of this. (I have to note, though, that reporting on Leftist demonstrations in D.C. seems to be a staple of PJ's repertoire, and so this article may bear some similarities to ones you've seen before. But then, that's true of Leftist demonstrations, too.)<br /><br />But PJ has more than one club in his golf bag, as his recounting of a trip to Iwo Jima shows. He can be funny, but he can also be moving, and sometimes almost poetic.  And nearly always, of course, memorable and worth re-reading. This may not be PJ's Best Book Ever, but it's still a fine addition to the shelf. Fans will enjoy it, and people interesting in well-written and original viewpoints on the world's trouble spots will find it worth picking up.	2005-01-21

When he tires of praising himself, he is more than willing to step aside and let someone else do it for a while.<br /><br />He wants to show you how to live the same way. In this unusual book, O'Reilly steps outside politics to alert you to how you're messing up your life by putting too much faith in public figures, media celebrities, religious leaders, even -- sometimes -- members of your own family. Get your life back on track by learning to recognize ... who's looking out for you!<br /><br />The author treats his voyage into self-help counseling -- call him \\"Bill O'Prah\\" -- as a Big Idea, along the lines of his Factor Concept (it's not just a TV show ... it's a Concept!). But apart from the revelation that network news anchors don't really have my personal interests at heart, most of the counsel here is pretty unremarkable. In his summing-up chapter \\"Here's to You,\\" Bill advises: Forgive yourself; Take care of your mind and body; Practice tolerance and independence. He encourages you to read books (especially, one presumes, his). One piece of advice I was hoping to see, but must have missed: Turn off the TV!<br /><br />Instead, we not only get lots of stories about Bill himself, but also quotations from other people writing about Bill. To complete the circle, I listened to the audiobooks version of this title, and got to hear O'Reilly narrating other people's stories about what a good guy O'Reilly is! The lesson that comes through most clearly is the one I summarized in my first paragraph.<br /><br />More seriously, there's one other piece of advice I hoped would have a prominent place here. But while O'Reilly made a brief feint in its direction in the final chapter, he never quite grappled with it. Nor, given his apparent self-obsession, should I have expected him to. Seems to me that if you want people to look out for you, be someone who looks out for others. Don't nurse your own sense of victimization and betrayal. Tone down the first-person pronoun and look around you. Call it the Golden Rule, good karma ... whatever works for you. The idea doesn't need 200 pages to explain, but it functions pretty well.<br /><br />In short, put not your faith in princes, nor in stars of TV, radio, and publishing empires. O'Reilly's basic point is true enough. I just wish it wasn't as eye-opening as some people seem to have found it, nor clothed quite so heavily in the author's own smug sense of self-worth. After all, if you get tripped up by that great SAT word, hubris, you may find there's no one left to look out for you when you fall.yal. Tone down the first-person pronoun and look around you.

For fans of the groundbreaking 1954 TV miniseries [[ASIN:0780608992 Victory at Sea]] this book is an essential companion to our videos, DVDs, and soundtrack recordings. It's too bad this volume isn't better known, because as fully as the drama of moving images can be captured in print, this book does it.<br /><br />The bulk of the \\"Victory at Sea\\" book was written by Henry Salomon -- the creator, producer, screenwriter, and general driving force of the TV series -- and the series' co-writer, Richard Hanser, with Hanser contributing additional chapters fleshing out the historical context of the actions being described.<br /><br />Those additional chapters are nice enough, but the important part of the book are the photos -- many captured from filmed sequences shown on the screen -- and their captions, taken from the show's memorable and idiosyncratic narration. Who familiar with the program won't find himself adopting Leonard Graves' distinctive phrasing when he reads: \\"The jungle -- where wild orchids flourish and cockatoos screech, where man struggles to exist and insects thrive -- the jungle: 90 menacing, tangled miles of it -- teeming with malaria, rot, and corruption which know no mercy. There is the enemy, unseen; there is the enemy -- everywhere. Now it begins: the toil and the terror that make Guadalcanal not a name but an emotion.\\"?<br /><br />I love the shows. I love the music. I love this book. It's not any more complicated than that.	2005-01-11

Bush	Books	3	12	24	N	N	Spicy but not especially nutritious	Ever eat a meal that's spicy-hot but lacking in any real flavor? That's what this book is like.<br /><br />Given America's new cottage industry of publishing Bush-bashing books, I'm the last person to begrudge the President's supporters from getting a little of their own back. In \\"A Matter of Character,\\" Ronald Kessler mounts a spirited defense of GWB and fires broadsides at a great many of his critics -- from Ann Richards to Dana Milbank of The Washington Post to Joseph Wilson and the unlamented Tom Daschle.<br /><br />From the \\"Inside the White House\\" subtitle, I was expecting this to have somewhat more insight on the organizational and operational dynamic at work. Instead, this portrait is largely personality-driven, and focuses on the key personalities in the Bush White House and how they relate to one another. It is largely, sometimes exceptionally, positive in that portrayal, even to the point of denying any tension at all between Colin Powell's State Department and Donald Rumsfeld's DOD. This particular argument runs so overwhelmingly against the tide of conventional wisdom at the time of publication that it made me wonder which side is the more delusional. I'm happy to celebrate a writer who takes a stand against the prevailing media, but even I had to question that assertion.<br /><br />I started this review several months ago, and set it aside when I realized that, although I had read the book cover to cover less than a week before, it had made almost no lasting impression on me. The text is fiery, the point-of-view distinctive, and the arguments outside the mainstream. But for all that, several months later it just seems ho-hum to me. I'm glad others enjoyed it, but *de gustibus, non disputandum est.* It didn't do much for me.	2005-01-11

But remember that this is a parody of a travel guide. And how many people sit down and read a Fodor's or Lonely Planet guide systematically, cover to cover? Very few, in my experience. Instead, you pick it up, open to an intriguing section at random, or check the index for the specific region or topic you're interested in, and read for a few pages.<br /><br />If you approach \\"Molvania\\" the same way, I think you'll find it pretty entertaining. Even if it has only one idea, that idea is a good one, and the authors execute it well. Again, in large doses it can get a little heavy-handed. But leave it someplace where you can browse it a little at a time -- or where an unsuspecting guest could find it on a bookshelf -- and the touch is just about right.	2005-01-05

His narratives of leisurely voyages through the waters of northern Europe -- many of which seem not to be currently available on Amazon.com -- are almost always a treat.<br /><br />In this volume, he steers the plucky Thames Commodore through the canals and coastal waters of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany, and into the harbors and sounds of Denmark. Like all the \\"Small Boat...\\" titles, this one blends the details of his touring with a focus on the history -- real and mythological -- of the lands and waters through which he's sailing. It seems at times like every river has its resident sprite, every island its angry giantess, and every harbor its ghost ships, and Roger Pilkington knows all their stories.<br /><br />In fact, the folklore seemed rather more abundant in this volume than I remember it being in some of the others, and at times I confess I found it a bit tedious.  At such times, I skipped ahead a little to get back to the contemporary narrative. But those stories may be more to other readers' tastes. They're certainly part of what makes a vicarious cruise with Pilkington, even three-plus decades after his books' publication, such a pleasant escape. No doubt like many readers, I'd have been more than willing to sign on as a hand (albeit a largely useless one) on one of Pilkington's trips in exchange for the chance to ride along with our narrator. I've not yet exhausted the stock of \\"Small Boat...\\" books, and I'm looking forward to signing on for those as well.	2005-01-04

France, like the United Nations, is an entity for which many Americans retain a lasting, if somewhat unspecific, affection. This is why France's recent \\"betrayal\\" of the U.S. (to borrow the title of another book on the topic) with regard to the Iraq War struck so many Americans so profoundly. \\"We saved their butts in two world wars,\\" the saying inevitably goes, \\"and this is how they thank us?\\"<br /><br />But as John Miller and Mark Molesky make clear, France's more or less explicitly anti-American posture in re the Middle East is far more consistent with nearly three centuries of shared history than any sense of obligation to us would be. In 1848, Austrian prime minister Felix Schwarzenberg was asked whether Austria felt any obligation to Russia for the help the Tsar had provided in putting down Hungarian rebels. Schwarzenberg famously responded \\"Austria shall astonish the world with the magnitude of her ingratitude.\\" Reading Miller and Molesky, one could easily imagine the same sentiment being echoed by De Gaulle in 1945 or Clemenceau in 1918.<br /><br />Some reviewers, including the sophisticates at the Financial Times, have chided Miller and Molesky for allegedly arguing that France has no right to pursue its own self interest. But the authors are neither as shocked as the reviewers make them out to be, nor so naïve as to expect the French to act contrary to their nature. Though this volume often reads like a prosecutor's brief against Perfidious Gallia, its intended target isn't the French, but instead us Americans. If we feel \\"betrayed\\" by the French, it's because we don't know our own history.<br /><br />Or, to put it another way, it's because we haven't read John J. Miller and Mark Molesky.	2005-01-03

I did, however, just finish reading the story itself for the first time. And I was surprised at how thin the story is, considering that the Raymond Massey-Humphrey Bogart film that was made from it seems to be considered by many one of the great combat-at-sea movies to come out of World War II.<br /><br />The fact is, there's just not a lot that happens in this book. Character development is minimal. And while there are a few exciting passages, usually involving torpedo attacks, these are brief payoffs for all the setting up you have to plow through to get there. The book is peopled with stock characters -- familiar now to anyone who knows their World War II films, and not quite so welcome to our modern sensibilities: the New York Jewish guy; the corn-fed Midwesterner; the Scandihoovian; the jut-jawed Navy Man; the dumb-but-loveable African American messman from the Deep South (who talks, natcherly, in awthennic di-uh-lekt that is painful to read today). I felt at times like these were the same group of people who showed up in the John Wayne film \\"Sands of Iwo Jima.\\"<br /><br />I hope Gilpatric's Glencannon books are better, because I'd still like to read those. In the meantime, the interested reader should be able to dust off this short book in little more time than it takes to watch the movie. On the whole, however, I'll take the film instead.	2005-01-03

Far from just a modification -- or still less, a simplification -- of enlisted recruit training, OCS and TBS, the two main parts of USMC officer training, are a world unto themselves and worthy of the attention Jack Ruppert has given them. This is a book that should be read, not only (as other reviewers have noted) by officer candidates or hope-to-be Marines, but by any reader interested in what makes the Corps America's most distinctive armed service.<br /><br />Ruppert's approach is to compare-and-contrast his own experience at The Basic School in 1956 with those of a class in 2000. He combines stories from his classmates with his own observations, studies with statistics, in-their-own-words reminiscences with as-it-happens reports from officer candidates ... in short, Ruppert gives us a pretty well-rounded look at what Marine officer training is all about. He doesn't employ the common technique of following specific individuals through training from start to finish, and consequently this book comes across as somewhat less personal -- in the sense of containing portraits of distinct individuals. However, he makes up for that not only with a wide breadth of coverage, but also a very personal stroll down his own memory lane.<br /><br />One of the impressions that comes across most strongly in this book is that Marine Corps officer training is not only physical -- though it is incredibly, intensely, physical -- but also ethical, moral, and perhaps surprisingly to some, intellectual. Far from the stereotype some may have of the Marine as a redneck automaton killing machine (thank you, \\"[[ASIN:0800127625 A Few Good Men]]\\"), Ruppert shows how the Corps in fact emphasizes personal initiative, innovation, even, dare we say, intellectualism.<br /><br />Ruppert's subtitle makes an important point, one he develops further in his text. OCS and TBS are concerned not just with creating \\"Marine officers,\\" but more importantly, \\"officers of Marines\\": men and women worthy of the Marines whom they will be leading. How this exacting training is carried out, and how and why it has changed over the years, is the focus of this most interesting title.

As someone who always had a general and somewhat uninformed interest in this genre, I now have a much more complete picture of the rise and decline of the British school story. For all I know, this may be the definitive work on the genre. What I can say that it is about as definitive as a non-specialist like me will probably ever need.<br /><br />From her vast reading of nearly a century's worth of novels, serials, and short stories set in British public schools, Isabel Quigly here focuses on the most significant, most representative, and best-written, as well as early works by otherwise notable authors, particularly P.G. Wodehouse. The aforementioned \\"Stalky & Co.,\\" reviled in its day but now seen as one of the most memorable of all school stories, gets an entire chapter of its own.<br /><br />Quigly traces the school story from the founding text of the genre, \\"Tom Brown's Schooldays,\\" up to the collapse of the school story along about World War II. She reveals an interesting parallelism, in that the stories imitated, exaggerated, parodied, and abandoned the \\"Tom Brown\\" model while British public schools themselves did much the same with the example of Dr. Arnold's Rugby, the school at which \\"Tom Brown\\" was set.<br /><br />Though the author's understanding of the genre seems nearly encyclopedic, it is far from uncritical. Both in her overview of school stories generally and her discussion of specific titles, she is clear-eyed and unsentimental, giving praise or criticism where it's deserved. Given the apparently overwhelming number of bad \\"pop\\" school stories, I was hoping she would indulge in something along the lines of Bill Pronzini's \\"Gun in Cheek\\" books, giving us a chapter or two of so-bad-its-good hilarity. Unfortunately, she restrained herself here.<br /><br />Even in the absence of such an entertaining, if unprofessional, diversion, there's enough personality in the author's writing to keep the reader entertained.  Far from a dull survey of a dead genre, this was a useful and interesting guide to a once-popular but now extinct class of literature. Readers interested in the school story, the British public school, or even British upper-class culture generally circa 1840-1940 would do well to find a copy of this book. I'm sorry it took me so long to do so, but at least it was worth the wait.d hilarity.

Labour MP Graham Allen, however, argues that Blair's greatest constitutional significance comes from developing, to the fullest extent yet seen, a *de facto* UK Presidency. This short book gives us Allen's historical pr&eacute;cis of how this happened. More importantly, it also presents why he thinks this is a good thing, and how it should be codified and made part of a larger, and much-overdue, reform of the British Constitution.<br /><br />For an American reader, Allen's use of the title \\"president\\" risks some misunderstanding of the nature of the British office. The author makes it clear that he's not talking about a presidency in precisely the American sense. For one thing, he is explicit that The Queen should remain Head of State. Nevertheless, Allen is convinced that the highly-centralized UK is already \\"a political monopoly\\" (p. 21), and the Prime Minister an office-holder with \\"power that would make Stalin blush\\" (p. 25). It struck me as linguistically more precise to have described the UK Presidency as a monarchy (\\"sole\\" + \\"ruler\\") or even a tyranny (my dictionary defines *tyrant*, without initial reference to cruelty, as \\"an absolute ruler without constitutional restrictions,\\" which sounds a lot like the way Allen paints the PM's office).<br /><br />But linguistic concerns are secondary, at best. What Graham Allen has given us is a spirited argument about the essential irrelevance of Parliament and its Members in the governance of Britain. Some MPs and small-c conservatives are apparently still cherishing the zombie of parliamentary supremacy and of the House of Commons as the Churchillian stage on which the nation's great issues are debated. Allen has no time for this myth. Today, he says, Parliament exists solely to provide democratic cover for the UK presidency. In Bagehot's terms, it is now part of the \\"dignified,\\" rather than the \\"efficient,\\" part of government (p. 74-5).<br /><br />The essential thing to remember is that Graham Allen considers the expanded UK presidency a good thing. His book is not a critique but rather, as the subtitle suggests, a plea to the \\"apathetic, disaffected\\" British democracy to recognize the historical development of a UK presidency and to make the most of this. That would be done, as I said, by codifying the presidency in a larger package of constitutional and government reform, to include renewed relevance for the House, stronger and more independent local government, and development of true separation of powers.<br /><br />Far as I am from Whitehall, I can only guess as to whether this tract has had any impact on British politics or society at all. I'm inclined to doubt it, precisely because of that \\"apathetic, disaffected\\" democracy and the fact that -- as the author himself notes -- it is to the advantage of the Prime Minister (any PM, not just the incumbent) to keep things undefined. Still, as a reader with an interest in British history and politics, I learned much from the author's analysis and found a good deal of merit in his arguments. I hope in raising these questions to a wider audience, he enjoys greater success than he did when he raised them in Prime Minister's Question Time.to provide democratic cover for the UK presidency.

This fact is one of the central themes in C. Bradford Mitchell's surprisingly interesting 1977 look at the first two decades of the Academy.<br /><br />I say \\"surprisingly interesting\\" because while this book necessarily includes more than a few descriptions of bureaucratic battles, academic politics, and the like, the USMMA story is told in a broader context. That context includes not only federal maritime training but also, for a good part of the book's time frame, the challenges and heroics of wartime. Indeed, Mitchell notes that although the school song is not precisely correct in describing the school as \\"strife-born\\" -- its foundations were laid before the start of the war -- the achievements made and losses suffered by the school and its graduates during World War II are an essential part of the Academy's ethos.<br /><br />Mitchell's work seems to cover all the relevant bases -- not only bureaucratic and academic, as noted, but also the physical construction of the Academy, the personalities of many of its key leaders, the development of the distinctive sea-year program, the various ships to serve as Training Vessels, and even the rise of Mariner athletics and a history of the school's mascots. An interesting chapter also covers the history of the two other former merchant officer-training establishments at Pass Christian, Mississippi, and San Mateo, California.<br /><br />The book's narrative ends with the passage of the 1956 Permanency Bill, a long-awaited and hard-fought-for measure officially establishing the USMMA *de jure* as a permanent federal academy. Kings Point had succeeded in convincing relevant parties of its value to the nation and the quality of its instruction. Bradford Mitchell has done much the same in recounting these battles. While the USMMA remains the most obscure service academy, readers interested in the school's history and the context of its current mission and relevance would probably find it worth their effort to track down a copy of this book.same in recounting these battles.

There is even a surprising number of people who seek out presidential gravesites (and write books about it, like C-SPAN's Brian Lamb). But it's far rarer for someone to attempt to meet and spend time with former presidents themselves. This book is the story of Bob Greene's effort to collect the whole set.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, this book is as much about Greene as it is about the living historical markers he sees the ex-presidents as having become. Americans have lived with president as Caesar, president as criminal, even retrospectively, president as demigod. Now we have president as tourist souvenir.<br /><br />Back during the 1992 campaign, when that young woman asked then-candidate Clinton the famous \\"boxers or briefs\\" question, I remember thinking, \\"You have a chance to ask a likely future president a question, and that's the best you could do? Shame on you.\\" I had something of the same reaction to this book. Greene explicitly set out to be non-political and non-confrontational, and if that's the direction he had to take to get in the door, than so be it. But it makes Greene's subjects -- whom, he argues, have fallen from exalted heights and are all mournfully cognizant of what they have lost -- seem even more banal to wind up sitting in their living rooms, offices, or hotels discussing sweaters or college football with Bob Greene. Only Jimmy Carter comes across as really *doing something* -- and consequently Greene in those chapters is reduced to part of the hyperkinetic Carter's entourage instead of being the sole object of hours of his subjects' attention, as he is in most of the rest of the book. (A great companion for this section, by the way, is Steven Hayward's \\"[[ASIN:0895260905 The Real Jimmy Carter: How Our Worst Ex-President Undermines American Foreign Policy, Coddles Dictators and Created the Party of Clinton and Kerry]]\\".)<br /><br />Greene comes to the realization that \\"you can be elected out of [the presidency], but ... apparently, in some ways, you can never really leave\\" (p. 182). This \\"[[ASIN:B000002GVO Hotel California]]\\" existence is a sign of how much we invest in our presidents, emotionally, symbolically, and even spiritually. Even a man like Gerald Ford, who filled the office for little more than two years, is elevated -- apotheosized -- for all time. Greene suggests Ford's image may show up on a coin someday (Ford himself, entirely rightly, considers the idea laughable). To see how this process affects the men themselves, and to try to tease some insights into the men's personalities out of Greene's readable but not especially deep prose, is probably the best way to approach this book.to the realization that \\"you can be elected out of [the presidency], but ... apparently, in some ways, you can never really leave\\" (p. 182).

From Alger Hiss to Gore Vidal, Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky to Betty Friedan and Margaret Sanger, Herbert Marcuse to Jacques Derrida, Daniel J. Flynn takes swings at most of the pillars of academic Leftism -- often through the practice of quoting those pillars' own ridiculous words. Along the way, he also fires on Leo Strauss (whom he accurately characterizes as \\"perhaps the most talked about but least read intellectual\\" these days [p. 131]) and Ayn Rand and their respective acolytes. But those chapters aside, this is overwhelmingly an attack on the Left. Fittingly so, since that's where so much of the \\"truth is relative\\" concept Flynn opposes resides today.<br /><br />The deconstruction, so to speak, of those \\"intellectual morons\\" certainly makes for entertaining, if sometimes often infuriating, reading. But I finished the book thinking, \\"And so...?\\" A better subtitle for this volume might have been \\"Stupid Ideas that Smart People have Fallen For,\\" since there's really less explanation of *How* these ideas were fallen-for than the flat statement that ideology explains why a charlatan like Rigoberta Menchu is given the attention she is. What's also missing, except in a few isolated cases, is evidence of whether, and if so how, these stupid ideas have had any influence outside academia or self-contained intellectual cults like the \\"Randroids.\\" It's those isolated cases -- the Straussians in the Bush administration, for example, or the social effects of the work of Kinsey and Sanger -- that make the most useful, as opposed to simply enlightening, reading. In other cases -- W.E.B. DuBois, for example, or again Ayn Rand -- I was more apt to respond, \\"Yeah, but who cares?\\"<br /><br />I would love to be able to find some way to stir this book together with Francis Wheen's \\"[[ASIN:1586482475 Idiot Proof: A Short History Of Modern Delusions]]\\". Although Flynn's is, on the whole, much the stronger book, taken together the two reveal the growing Endarkenment as America and the West retreat from rationalism and into a world of relativism, emotionalism, and \\"truth\\" in the service of political or cultural objectives. I'm afraid Flynn may largely be preaching to the choir here -- his book is filled with examples of how his targets attack or ignore critics -- but his work is still one that deserves to be read.Flynn's is, on the whole, much the stronger book, taken together the two reveal the growing Endarkenment as America and the West retreat from rationalism and into a world of relativism, emotionalism, and \\"truth\\" in the service of political or cultural objectives.

Lately, I've decided to learn more about the US Merchant Marine Academy, and have set for myself the goal of reading as many books about the school as I can. It's not taken very long for me to work my way through them, because while you could sink a Victory Ship under the weight of books written about West Point or Annapolis, the number of titles about the USMMA, Kings Point, would not over-burden a kayak. Particularly difficult, amid the handful of picture books for grads, has been finding anything that actually talks about the course of study at Kings Point, the life of the USMMA midshipman, and more fundamentally, why the Academy exists in the first place.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise, then, to discover that the comprehensive look at the Academy I'd been searching for was written almost half a century ago (the 1975 publication was a reprint of the 1958 original). I wasn't expecting Irving Crump's book to be this useful, because I was a little disappointed by his similar work about the Coast Guard Academy where so much focus was given to stories of Coastie derring-do that the USCGA itself remained something of a cipher.<br /><br />But not here. In this book, well-chosen stories of Merchant Marine heroism serve as introductions to descriptive chapters on various facets of the Kings Point course of study. The deck and engineering departments receive about equal time, and the unique feature of the Sea Year is thoroughly explored. The balance between civilian studies and naval science is explained, as is the importance of lifesaving, swimming, and seamanship skills.<br /><br />Obviously, the fact that this book is 50 years old means that some elements of it are somewhat out of date. Modern concepts like containerization and \\"intermodal transportation\\" don't show up here, and frequent references to \\"the men of the Merchant Marine\\" remind us that co-education of the Academy was still some decades away. The romance of the sea and the chance to have adventures and see the world are big selling points for the Academy in this book, while they seem to be downplayed somewhat in more contemporary material.<br /><br />Nevertheless, you take what you can get. And with books on the USMMA as scarce as they apparently are (is there something out there I'm missing?), even a title half a century old is worth tracking down and poring over if you're looking for insights on the Academy. I for one was glad to find a copy of this book, and I think any student or parent considering the school could still do worse than spending some time inside these pages.d see the world are big selling points for the Academy in this book, while they seem to be downplayed somewhat in more contemporary material. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, you take what you can get.

Though it's not a truly in-depth look at the Coast Guard, the Academy, or the cadet experience, it's still not a bad introduction, given its intended audience. The book's overview of the Academy's four academic years, the day-to-day life of a cadet, and the options for post-graduation careers in the Coast Guard all seem to paint pictures appropriate for the readers most likely to pick this title up.<br /><br />One of the more entertaining parts of the \\"Life Inside\\" series has been spotting the factual errors and mis-identified photos, and this book has plenty of opportunities as well. For example, on page 16 the author describes the USCGA as \\"the first of the four armed-services academies to admit woman cadets\\" -- although the US Merchant Marine Academy, the *fifth* federal military academy, admitted women in 1974. Similarly, we're told on page 27 that \\"unlike other military academies, the Coast Guard Academy has both officers and civilians as professors.\\" In fact, all five federal academies have both civilian and military professors on staff.<br /><br />(You could, I suppose, argue that the USMMA isn't an \\"armed-service\\" academy, and that military faculty members at other academies aren't really \\"professors.\\" But not only would those arguments be highly questionable, they depend on a level of semantic nit-picking that seems out of place in a book targeted at young readers.)<br /><br />As in the other books, a reliance on stock photos makes it very hard to prove, for example, that the lacrosse and football players shown actually compete for the Academy. The photos that are obviously of the Academy and Academy cadets, however, are well chosen.<br /><br />Young readers with an interest in the military and the possibility of a career afloat will probably find this a useful, if still largely superficial, introductory reference.	2004-11-18

Go to the Air Force Academy. But what exactly does the Merchant Marine Academy do, and why would you want to go there? These answers are not so intuitive ... even assuming a young person has heard of the USMMA in the first place, which can't always be taken for granted.<br /><br />There aren't very many books in print about the US Merchant Marine Academy, and fewer still that make a case for why a young person might want to attend. Given that gap, it's a good thing that this brief book is as comprehensive as it is. It provides a decent overview of the Merchant Marine as a career, the peculiar demands of life at Kings Point, and what a graduate's opportunities and obligations are. If this book doesn't answer every conceivable question, at least it should help a student considering a career in uniform or at sea decide whether the USMMA is an option to consider.<br /><br />This book isn't perfect, however. It continues the series' habit of generic stock photography, misinformed captions, and the occasional questionable assertion. My favorite is the photo on page 38, where the caption reads, \\"USMMA graduates often work on Coast Guard cutters, such as this one, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.\\" Apart from the errant second comma, which suggests grads are uniquely called to cutters off the coast of Newfoundland, the reason the particular cutter in the photo is off the coast of Canada is that it clearly and unmistakably belongs to the *Canadian* Coast Guard -- with a Canadian flag, a maple leaf on the stack, and even the word \\"Canada\\" painted on the hull. Which isn't to say that no USMMA grad has ever served in the Canadian Coast Guard (have any?), but surely not \\"often.\\"<br /><br />Apart from those occasional slips, however, I have to admit to being surprised by how thorough this title was, relative to some of the other ones in the series. A young reader who picks this up should come away from it with a pretty clear idea of whether the USMMA is something she might be interested in investigating further. And as an introductory resource, that's not a bad start.s.

The Air Force Academy is well-represented too. But books about the US Coast Guard Academy -- and still more the US Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point -- are much harder to find. And that makes a book like this one, unfashionable and even out-of-date as it may be, a reference that interested parties might find worth their while to track down.<br /><br />I say \\"unfashionable\\" because quite a lot of this book is taken up with a history of the Coast Guard told through the sorts of stories of heroism and sacrifice that seemed to appeal to \\"red-blooded American boys\\" of decades past but seem to have lost their attractiveness, or at least become much less common, today. While we do eventually get to the Academy itself (100 pages in!), the balance of the book still goes back and forth between stories of the Coast Guard in action and descriptions of the life and training of Academy cadets.<br /><br />The description of the Academy and Academy life is a good one. It may not be in keeping with the modern jargon of the school as a \\"laboratory for leadership,\\" but as long as you can get past the pre-coeducation description of cadets as \\"boys\\" and \\"men,\\" you should still get a pretty good idea of what the Academy offers and demands. A quick visit to the Academy's web site suggests that some elements of the program, particularly the summer training, have changed significantly from what's described here. But as an all-too-rare book-length introduction to this lesser-known school and its unique program, this volume, old as it is, is a useful reference for anyone with an interest in the Academy.	2004-11-11

Of course, Jane Langton's clever satire works best for people who remember the 1980s. But sophisticated young readers should be able to decode the allegory even today.<br /><br />The author has done a fine job capturing the childish earnestness of the mid-1980s disarmament movement, portraying it here as a literal band of children marching to Washington to protest deployment of the \\"Peace Missile,\\" a sort of combination of two of the movement's bêtes noire, the \\"Peacekeeper\\" ICBM and the Strategic Defense Initiative, or \\"Star Wars.\\" Singing \\"We Shall Overcome,\\" no less, the children march south to face down a scheming, hyper-patriotic President. Few writers for young adults, in my experience, have so clearly revealed the Left's essential view of America, not as rational adults capable of debating policy on its merits, but rather as \\"a mighty swarm of children\\" (p. 264). Having them base their beliefs on fuzzy emotionalism and (drug-induced?) visions of all the people and animals going up in a ball of fire is just one example of the precision of her satire.<br /><br />Of course, this book isn't just a simple allegory. Its elements of fantasy make it especially entertaining. In the real world, could a march like the Peace Pilgrimage have made it two blocks without the harpies from Child Protective Services descending on it? Would any sensible parent allow pre-teens to undertake an epic like this, not only unsupervised, but in the company of an infant? (That infant, by the way, is one of Langton's true gems. Not only does his name, Carrington, imply that even in his infancy he is \\"caring [a] ton\\" about the future of the earth, but it is also a clear dig at the fictional family from the  TV series \\"Dynasty,\\" a Reagan-era exemplar of the materialistic super-rich. Even Blake and Krystle, she seems to be saying, can redeem themselves by being born again [!] with the faith of precocious babies.) In fact, the world of rational adults -- of grown-ups with telling names like Mrs. Brisket and Miss Prawn, suggestive again of man's continual cruelty to animals -- is rejected entirely, so complete is the author's allegory.<br /><br />Who needs Ann Coulter's sledgehammer when we've got Jane Langton's rapier?

Churchill, few people can be said to approach Sir Martin Gilbert in their knowledge of the man and his life. Here, in conjunction with the Imperial War Museum, Gilbert has produced a wonderful visual record of \\"His 'Finest Hour' in Photographs.\\"<br /><br />The book is divided up by years, with each year receiving a brief narrative introduction. It is not a photographic history of the war, and there are few photos of Churchill \\"off duty\\" -- to the extent he ever was in those years. But what it sets out to be, it achieves extremely well.<br /><br />Looking through this volume, I was impressed by the quality of (most of) these photos, and especially impressed by the sharpness and clarity with which they are reproduced here. I admit I have a particular distaste for photo-books with few or insufficient captions, and so I was very pleased to see that Gilbert gives each photo a thorough description, including not only what Churchill is doing in the image, but also naming other key people in the image and often even giving the date on which the photo was taken.<br /><br />I think this would be an excellent addition to the shelf (or coffee table) of any member of the vast legion of Churchillians around the globe. I have no hesitation in recommending it for the gift list for the Churchillian in your life.	2004-11-04

Flynn is nevertheless an important one. It's also strangely timely: some of the issues and personalities surrounding the question of \\"Who lost China?\\" were raised more recently in Ann Coulter's \\"[[ASIN:1400050324 Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism]].\\" Coulter readers interested in exploring the question more fully could do far worse than to track down a copy of this title.<br /><br />Flynn was a tireless slayer of sacred cows, and one of the central figures of the anti-New Deal coalition now remembered as the Old Right. This book deals largely with the question of Communist domination of Asia, in particular China and Korea. But most of the attention is focused in the U.S., and particularly upon the men -- some dupes, some Comsymps (ah, for the good old days of Red-baiting language), and a few dedicated Soviet agents -- in Washington and elsewhere who made that domination possible.<br /><br />A key part of Flynn's thesis is that the print, film, and radio media were deliberately employed to soften Americans' natural opposition to Communist totalitarianism. The idea was to prepare us for the idea of Soviet \\"partnership\\" (and thus accept the legitimacy of the Soviet system) in the post-World War II era. A large section of the book is filled with examples of pro-Communist propaganda in all three media, and the silencing -- contra the \\"McCarthyism\\" myth -- of critics of the Russian or Chinese Communists. In partnership with the pro-Communist agitprop were the missteps and blunders committed by political leaders, particularly FDR, Marshall, and Acheson. Truman, too, receives his fair share of blame. But as Flynn notes, most of the seeds of \\"our tragedy in Asia\\" were planted during the FDR years.<br /><br />Does any of this matter any more? Flynn's lessons about the propagandistic power of the media are certainly still relevant and worthy of deep study. And though the guns are silent, China and Korea are certainly still in the headlines. Unraveling the mythology of the rise of Communism in Asia is essential for grappling with the situation there today. Perhaps most important of all is taking the time yet again to knock the pins out from under the vastly inflated reputations of FDR and Truman. Few men have ever performed that valuable service better than John T. Flynn. He deserves to be remembered, and read, with our thanks.wer of the media are certainly still relevant and worthy of deep study.

Finally doing so was a rewarding experience -- not only (although mostly) to meet the real Marty Maher behind the Tyrone Power character, but also to see what was gained and what was lost when the novel was adapted to the screen.<br /><br />If, like me, you come to this book through the prism of the movie, you'll find this story a lot less linear than the movie. Although Marty tells his story (and it's clear from the text that most of this book was literally \\"as told to\\" his coauthor Nardi Reeder Campion) in a mostly chronological way, there's still a bit of skipping around and some gaps in the time-frame. Not everything fits together quite as well as it does in the film, but life is like that. The book also lacks the sometimes-schmaltzy sentimentality of the film.<br /><br />At the same time, the reader who knows the movie will be able to recognize many of the seeds in this book that grew into key scenes on film.<br /><br />The more interesting and honest task, though, is to try to separate the movie from the book and read (and review) the latter on its own merits. When you do, Marty comes across as a charming and entertaining man with an interesting story to tell. He saw an awful lot in his half-century-plus at West Point, and does seem to have been truly beloved by generations of graduates. He certainly could have filled many more pages with his reminiscences, and it's perhaps a shame that he didn't. I would have liked to have read more about life on the Point and how it changed over the decades.<br /><br />But this book is Marty's story, not West Point's, and while the two were nearly synonymous -- or so it seems -- for many decades, many people have told the Academy's story. It was up to Marty and his co-author to tell his own, and it's a wonderful thing that he did. He's a man who deserves to be remembered, and remembered with affection -- not only by those who had a chance to know him, but also by those of us who have only experienced him in film or print.eserves to be remembered, and remembered with affection -- not only by those who had a chance to know him, but also by those of us who have only experienced him in film or print. <br />	2004-10-25

This book is like a USNA reunion, with former Mids from the Class of 1931 all the way to the Class of 1994 trading tales and sparking memories. It's particularly interesting to see the same story told from two different perspectives, as happens several times between these covers.<br /><br />The subtitle declares this \\"A Ring-Knockers' Bedside [or, as the title page has it, 'Bedtime'] Companion\\" and that's appropriate on two counts. First, while this is entertaining reading for anyone with an interest in the Naval Academy, its primary audience is definitely USNA grads themselves. There is a helpful glossary of Annapolis argot, but many of the stories will undoubtedly mean more to someone who's been through the Academy. I can think of at least one tale, involving a bowling ball, that while funny will still be largely incomprehensible to anyone unfamiliar with the internal geometry of Bancroft Hall.<br /><br />The second reason the subtitle fits is that I think this volume works best as a \\"bedside companion\\" for quick dipping-into before falling asleep. While I read the volume straight through from end to end, it seems like shorter, more leisurely visits would be more rewarding. In that sense, and given the vast number of alums who apparently didn't submit stories, it's a shame this book isn't two or three times longer than it is.<br /><br />If I do have a complaint, it's with the organization and arrangement of the stories. The chapters are divided up based on \\"The Laws of the Navy\\" Mids memorize during Plebe Summer, but I seldom saw the connection between a given story and its placement in the book. Also, some submissions are quite long and contain many reminiscences, while other contributors have had their stories divided up among several chapters. This results in, for example, Jeff Conklin ('93) making reference to \\"the same upperclassman who caught my 'Go Army' blunder\\" nearly 100 pages before the story of that blunder is told. Similarly, Bob Osmon ('60)'s entry on page 248 begins with the cryptic sentence, \\"The second episode didn't have such dire consequences\\" -- cryptic, that is, until the reader remembers to flip back to page 142, where Osmon mentions \\"Two events that happened to my roomie and me,\\" but then only relates the first of the two.<br /><br />Those complaints aside, it was nice to see both familiar names like Joseph Taussig (a hero of Pearl Harbor who died very recently), James L. Holloway, and Sumner Shapiro (a household name in my home, anyway) as well as many grads not so well known. These are some funny stories, and a look inside the Academy at things most visitors never see and most books never relate.who caught my 'Go Army' blunder\\" nearly 100 pages before the story of that blunder is told.

Whether you're living in a masterfully maintained bungalow, are interested in restoring a bungalow to its former glory, or just a fan of good architectural or furniture design, Paul Duchscherer and Douglas Keister's \\"Bungalow Basics\\" series has a lot to offer.<br /><br />Unlike many modern homes with their spacious and luxurious \\"master suites,\\" bungalow bedrooms were often small and utilitarian spaces. As much as half of the home's limited space was generally devoted to the public living and dining rooms. But though the bedroom was often a small retreat, the quality of the design was not inferior to the rest of the home, and this volume in the series is every bit as informative and evocative as the others. Master, children's, and guest bedrooms are all covered, as are lofts, Murphy beds, and other innovative space-saving solutions.<br /><br />As you would imagine in a book this small, there's not a lot of depth to the discussion. Nor does any individual example receive more than one or two photos (except for the famous Gamble House in Pasadena, California). And finally, there's no list of sources where an interested reader could find any of the items or materials pictured herself. So this is not, by any stretch, a do-it-yourself handbook. As the series name suggests, however, this is a focus on the basics. And someone who reads this will have a better idea of the theory of bungalow design, and more than a few great examples of the theory in practice. For the handy little resource this is intended to be, this title carries out its mission quite well.	2004-10-20

Far from the forbidding volume of dusty minutia a book like this could have been, \\"Drawing Out the Man\\" struck me more like a fireside chat with an old friend.<br /><br />Wise covers an awful lot of ground, but seldom gets bogged down in oppressive detail. The history of buildings and grounds mixes well with profiles of superintendents, key members of the board of directors or faculty, and of course memorable cadets. The I's involvement in the War Between the States gets due attention, of course, but so do the accomplishments of former cadets in the World Wars and in various non-martial settings. There are bureaucratic battles with the Commonwealth over funding and other issues, and also coverage of some of the more noteworthy \\"step-offs\\" or cadet revolts over the years. The narrative ends in 1978, so obviously the many important changes that have taken place at VMI in the decades since have no place in this book.<br /><br />VMI's history actually takes up only the first half or so of this volume. The second part, \\"The Institute in Higher Education in the 1970s\\" is a look at academics, athletics, and military education at the school that will probably be of less interest to readers in 2004 and beyond (although chapter 14, \\"Cadet Life Today,\\" may be interesting for purposes of comparison). The third part, \\"A Body of Alumni Who Care,\\" looks at the alumni association, the VMI Foundation, the Marshall Research Foundation, and the Keydet Club. This too I found much less interesting than the main body of the book.<br /><br />On the whole, this volume was a pretty interesting read. Wise is clearly a partisan of the school, and so people looking for a blanket denunciation of military-based higher education or the \\"dark underside\\" of cadet life will find neither of them here (though Wise certainly doesn't downplay the hardships of being a student at VMI). I don't know how many contemporary readers will want to sit down and follow the story from beginning to end, but for research on a specific topic or just picking up and browsing through as a way to get a better understanding of VMI and its unique history, this struck me as a valuable resource to have around.re (though Wise certainly doesn't downplay the hardships of being a student at VMI).

It certainly didn't answer all my questions, but then, I didn't really expect it to.<br /><br />What I most expected is what the book did an excellent job delivering: high-quality photography, well-reproduced and well-explained. Even five years past its publication date, I think this book would probably make an excellent gift for loyal Ags (are there any other kind?), their parents, and other friends of the University.<br /><br />Though there is some expository text, the copy doesn't get in the way of the large and colorful photos (extremely helpful are the small-text explanations of the quotes and photos that fill several pages at the back of the book). Wide-angle or aerial photography blends with close-ups of individual students. Most of the emphasis seems to be on the campus' buildings and grounds, but there is also fair coverage of the Corps. Non-reg students may feel a bit left out -- but on the other hand, one of the Corps' historic roles (perhaps THE historic role) has been as the defender and upholder of the very \\"legacy of tradition\\" evoked in this volume's subtitle.<br /><br />As the flap about a recent article on A&M in \\"Texas Monthly\\" magazine shows, the traditions that give the school its distinctive identity are coming under attack from many quarters. Though hardly the full story on all that A&M is (or, some might say, WAS), this attractive book should spur a lot of happy memories for anyone who loves the school.	2004-10-15

The photography is exceptional, and the reproduction of the images on these pages is of high quality. You can practically count the individual threads in the cadets' coatees. I was also pleased to find that the captions accompanying the photos tend to explain what's happening in them, or at least provide some sort of context to the images.<br /><br />An explanation of the Ratline and the phenomenon of Rat year is an essential component of any book about VMI, and Geoffrey Norman's text does a fine job here, too. This book was produced with the cooperation of VMI itself, and that access shows in the detail and thoroughness with which the VMI experience is explained. It may well be true that nobody who hasn't been through the Ratline can ever truly understand it -- but within those limitations, I feel like I have a much better grasp of what is involved, and what it all means, than I did before.<br /><br />Certainly this book would make a fine gift for a VMI alum, or something he (or she!) would like to get for themselves. VMI parents and friends would get a lot out of it too, as would students and parents thinking about attending the Institute.  I've been doing what I can to find and read as many books about \\"the I\\" as possible, and so far this is one of the, or perhaps THE, very best. I don't see that evaluation changing any time soon	2004-10-12

It's a beautiful book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what the beautiful pictures lack is any sort of context or explanation. In fact, to adapt the motto of the Academy itself, the motto of this book might be *imagines non verba* -- images, not words. And I don't mean simply that the captions are inadequate. Rather, there ARE no captions: no explanations AT ALL for what we're being shown. What's the story behind the USMMA Battle Standard on page 8? What are the candidates on page 29 reading so intently? Why is the midshipman on pages 38-39 saluting a steering wheel? Why is the midshipman in the honor guard on page 87 grabbing the end of another mid's sword? Why is the football stadium on pages 70-71 flying the Maryland state flag upside-down?<br /><br />The answers to these questions (except maybe the last one) might be of interest to the reader who comes to this book trying to learn more about America's least-known service academy -- to say nothing of more basic questions like, \\"What's the point of a merchant marine academy anyway?\\" But without any narrative -- save for a few very brief excerpts from other people's speeches and articles -- we're out of luck. That suggests that this book was intended more for nostalgic alums and other people who already know what all this represents. If you're one of those people, you may find this book quite satisfying indeed. But if, like me, you're not ... well, we're just on our own.<br /><br />And as someone who was hoping for a lot more (check out Anthony Edgeworth's seriously impressive VMI book \\"The Institute\\" to see what something like this COULD be), that's very disappointing.	2004-10-12

After years of unsuccessfully trying to track down a copy of this book to purchase, I finally had the sense to try inter-library loan. That secured the book for me, but only for three weeks. And it wasn't enough!<br /><br />That's because this book is, in many ways, typical Kuehnelt-Leddihn. Its prose is fact-filled, thought-provoking, erudite and polyglot. And, of course, dense with footnotes (1,289, in fact). You need to stop frequently to process the argument just presented to you. It's hard to do that with a due date looming just ahead.<br /><br />This book is divided into three sections. The first, \\"Europe in the Round,\\" analyses the continent through the lenses of geography, \\"races, ethnic units, nations,\\" religions, nationalities and languages, political structures, and other general themes. In the middle section, K-L takes us on a country-by-country tour of Europe as it existed in the late 1970s. Each country is presented thoroughly, but again with a focus on languages, ethnicities, and religion as well as on political institutions and development. While every country's chapter is educational, I think the most thorough, and most interesting, parts were K-L's looks at France, \\"the Germanies\\" [a term he told us back in \\"Menace of the Herd\\" was a more accurate description of the region than simply \\"Germany\\" -- and that was before the division into BRD and DDR!], and Spain.<br /><br />The final section, \\"America, Europe, and the Continuing War,\\" looks at America's relations with the Continent through history, with a special focus on the Cold War. It's this section that will be most familiar to students of K-L, for here he most explicitly interweaves the themes of his other works into the specific lessons the \\"intelligent American\\" should carry away about Europe.<br /><br />And what are those lessons? As K-L writes at the start of this third section, \\"I would be very happy if, by presenting my ideas, notions, and data -- all totally insufficient to convey real knowledge -- I have helped to create the impression that Europe, which figures so prominently in American foreign policy, is an extremely complex part of the world and that anyone who wants to deal with European affairs has to be some sort of scholar, traveler, and linguist\\" (p. 393). A K-L, in short. As he did in \\"Leftism Revisited,\\" the author is especially keen to illustrate how Americans' traditional lack of understanding of European history, culture, language, and even geography have had dire consequences over the last century. The general American sense that \\"Everyone is pretty much like everyone else\\" and \\"Everyone would be happier if their country was more like the USA\\" bear little connection to the realities of Europe.<br /><br />As ever, K-L's arguments are counterintuitive to the average American, and also sometimes idiosyncratic. Readers who cherish the nostrums about democracy, \\"progress,\\" and American exceptionalism lovingly peddled in our nation's classrooms will probably find a good deal of this book profoundly disquieting. Which is no doubt precisely what the author intended.<br /><br />Presumably, encouraging other readers to track down copies of this book may make it harder for me to secure one for myself. But I'll take that chance because I think this volume is an essential addition to the shelves of any K-L student. And even given the many changes that have taken place in Europe since 1979, this is still a valuable, if sorely neglected, resource for students of European history, politics, and culture. K-L's focus is on things that last far longer than mere political borders or ruling parties, and that makes this impressive, educational, and even entertaining book a useful resource for many years to come.y real knowledge -- I have helped to create the impression that Europe, which figures so prominently in American foreign policy, is an extremely complex part of the world and that anyone who wants to deal with European affairs has to be some sort of scholar, traveler, and linguist\\" (p. 393).

Very similar.<br /><br />Very.<br /><br />Two things set this title apart, however. One is that there is generally less commentary on the recipes here, and I tended to find Lileks' ironic tone a little tiresome when taken in large doses. Here, though, it was much easier to sit down and digest, so to speak, much of this book all at once. A second difference is that author and chef Kathy Casey (go Seattle!) apparently actually gave some of these recipes a try, which I'm not sure, or can't remember whether, Lileks ever did. That bravery on her part gives her commentary a bit more personal insight.<br /><br />As with Lileks' book, the overwhelming conclusion the reader comes to after flinching his way through these cringe-inducing recipes, is, \\"How in the world could they eat this stuff?\\" Also: What was the deal with all the gelatin? I do, however, have to call B.S. (as the saying goes) on a couple of the recipes here. Short of seeing primary documentation, I absolutely refuse to believe that Jellied Moose Nose (p. 67) is a real period recipe [edit: I've since been informed that yes, it is]. And I have my doubts about Gingersnap Tongue (p. 80) and Heart With Apple-Raisin Stuffing (p. 88) too. But apart from them, I mostly marvel at the twisted and/or desperate minds that could come up with things like Veal-Oyster Loaf (p. 70), three words that should NEVER appear in sequence, or the magnificent Crown Roast of Frankfurters (p. 75), which I believe, again, is in Lileks' book too. Who knew the dry heaves were such a good abs workout?<br /><br />I'm looking forward to tracking down other books in this Retro series, because they, presumably, will be charting some newer ground in the ironic-look-back-at-times-less-cool-than-today genre.

Patterson's first book, \\"Dereliction of Duty,\\" was that it was written from a solid first-hand perspective. While many of his insights about the Clinton administration's impact on the military and national security were interesting and useful, the biggest \\"news hook\\" was the fact that he had seen much of it himself while working in the White House.<br /><br />This book doesn't have that kind of first-hand newsworthiness. In fact, most of the facts contained here are the same ones you'll find in \\"Unfit for Command,\\" Ann Coulter's \\"Treason,\\" and any number of other books about Kerry or the Clintons. Patterson's military perspective is again the principal distinctive here. With the exception of a handful of personal stories, most of the facts here will probably already be familiar to people inclined to pick this book up in the first place.<br /><br />One more thing I do need to note is that this book, again like \\"Dereliction of Duty,\\" is pretty darn short. The author has a tendency to pad his page count with long appendices filled with other authors' work. In his first book, it included a lengthy excerpt from one of Caspar Weinberger's books. Here he gives us a reprint of President Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy document and page after page of John Kerry's 1971 testimony before the Senate foreign relations committee. Once you take out the 20 pages of introduction by Thomas Winter (which pretty much sums everything up anyway) and the 70 pages of appendix, there are really only about 130 pages of book left.<br /><br />Colonel Patterson's love for our military and respect for our fighting men and women come through on every page, as does his anger at the way the American Left, and John Kerry in particular, have consistently undermined the military for the last several decades.

By the book's own admission (p. 251), and despite the effort to balance the survey pool between conservatives and liberals, the results of this survey varied hardly at all from one done by the overtly liberal Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., in 1996. In fact, if you compare the results of this survey to those of three others (not including Schlesinger's) analyzed by statisticians Richard Vedder and Lowell Gallaway in the far more interesting [[ASIN:0945466293 Reassessing the Presidency : The Rise of the Executive State and the Decline of Freedom]] (Mises Institute, 2001), you'll see that nearly all surveys of \\"presidential greatness\\" turn out pretty darn similar to one another.<br /><br />Vedder and Gallaway have a theory about this: the historians and other academics surveyed for things like this are dependent on government for their income, and thus have a clear bias in favor of presidents who increase the size, scope, and expense of state power. Presidents who don't flex the muscle of government and generally leave the American people alone, get ranked much lower. Despite (or these days because of?) the conservative leanings of the Federalist Society, the Wall Street Journal, and many of the contributors, the bias here seems to lean the same way.<br /><br />It's too bad the folks who assembled this collection chose to focus on the presidential survey, because the forty-two essays on the individual presidents are the more interesting part of the book. Like the presidents themselves, some of these essays shine, some are disappointing, and quite a number are unremarkable. The decision to have Ken Starr write on Richard Nixon was a stroke of genius, while Peggy Noonan on JFK was up to the high lyrical standards of her Reagan biography. The two best essays, in my opinion, were a fascinating piece by Jeffrey K. Tulis arguing for Andrew Johnson as a far more significant transitional figure in the history of the presidency than he is usually given credit for being, and John O. McGinnis' portrait of Calvin Coolidge as perhaps (my words, not his) the most libertarian president we've ever had. Ari Hoogenboom's look at Rutherford B. Hayes reminded me that Hoogenboom's Hayes biography has been on my to-read list for an awful long time, and made me want to move it up that list somewhat.<br /><br />On the down side, I don't think you need to be a fan of Thomas DiLorenzo and his [[ASIN:0761526463 The Real Lincoln: A New Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda, and an Unnecessary War]] (although I am) to be a little skeptical of the Christlike-colossus-bestriding-the-earth sort of language with which Jay Winik clothes the holy martyr, Abraham Lincoln, or the breezy ease with which he dismisses Lincoln's trampling of law and Constitution. Similarly disappointing was John McCain's discovery, in a recycled bit from his memoirs, that Theodore Roosevelt was a proto-John McCain (so much for my hope that he would report Mark Twain's conclusion that \\"Theodore, as statesman and politician, is insane and irresponsible\\").<br /><br />Unsurprisingly -- it's typical for books about the presidency -- the descriptions of recent presidents are always more problematic than those of men shrouded in the mists of time. I thought Paul Johnson, for example, did a masterful job dissecting Bill Clinton (the third best essay in the book), but I can imagine it will give his still-active legion of supporters hives. Joshua Muravchik's essay on Jimmy Carter, the smallest and least of our ex-presidents, gives this sanctimonious failure the hiding he deserves.<br /><br />The pages of the Wall Street Journal frequently feature some of the best opinion writing going today, and the quality of that writing is carried over into this book.

That's because this accessible and informative book is a powerful antidote to many of the lies about the free market that we Americans have been suckered into believing. If this title gets as wide a distribution as it deserves, maybe Americans will once again be a nation where capitalism -- and capitalists -- are honored and anti-market demagogues from Michael Moore to Hillary Clinton receive the ignominy they deserve.<br /><br />Thomas DiLorenzo has his facts behind him, but he also writes in an engaging and easy-to-follow style that doesn't get weighed down by abstruse statistics or heavy jargon. In fact, \\"How Capitalism Saved America\\" could well be, and *should* well be, an economics or history textbook for high schools everywhere. From the myth of FDR ending the Depression to the lies still being told about Microsoft and the \\"robber barons,\\" from antitrust and energy \\"deregulation\\" to the illegitimate powers of labor unions and government regulators ... DiLorenzo covers it all.<br /><br />Perhaps most timely, DiLorenzo rescues the term \\"capitalism\\" from those who try to use it to describe sweetheart deals between government and industry like those allegedly involving the Bush administration (and family) and corporations like Haliburton. Massive corporate welfare schemes are *mercantilism* (or neo-mercantilism, if you prefer), not capitalism or \\"the free market.\\" Restoring true economic liberty starts with getting your terms straight. That's one more reason this book is so useful.<br /><br />The people who most need to read this are probably the ones least likely to actually do so. However, if it's pro-market readers who have pushed this title's sales rank up so high, more power to them (us). Here's hoping we all use the ammunition DiLorenzo has given us to mount the spirited intellectual defense of capitalism that our nation, and our liberty, so deserve.so deserve.  <br />	2004-09-12

But \\"Cronies\\" didn't turn out like Lind's comically tendentious \\"[[ASIN:0465041221 Made In Texas: George W. Bush And The Southern Takeover Of American Politics (New America Books)]]\\" at all. Instead, Robert Bryce has assembled a pile of puzzle pieces in a way that not only makes a lot of sense, but that forms a picture the American electorate needs to see. As much as it pains me to agree with Molly Ivins about anything at all, this is excellent investigative reporting.<br /><br />Bryce has gone back into the history of the Texas awl bidness and shown how, from the beginning, key players in that industry have cultivated their connections with politicians to increase their own wealth and power. Many Texas politicians, from LBJ and Sam Rayburn to Jim Wright, Tom DeLay, and a whole mess of Bushes, have been more than happy to be so cultivated, since it tends to result in floods of cash into their re-election campaigns, foundations, and presidential libraries. Though Bryce is far from the only writer shining a spotlight on Halliburton and Brown & Root these days, his work is among the best charting the complex web of ties between politics, the military, big business, and foreign policy. Combine all this incestuous intermingling with the international entanglements described in Chalmers Johnson's \\"[[ASIN:0805077979 The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)]],\\" and you come up with an especially unsavory look at America's 50-plus year run of hand-over-first mercantilism.<br /><br />My use of the term \\"mercantilism\\" is deliberate, because one complaint I do have about this book -- as I did with Michael Mann's \\"[[ASIN:1844675289 Incoherent Empire]]\\" -- is the author's apparent assumption that what he's describing is \\"capitalism.\\" Toward the end of the book, he mentions, apparently without irony, \\"laissez-faire Texas Republicans\\" like DeLay and President Bush, even though he's just spent the previous 270 pages showing that their economic philosophy is anything *but* \\"leave us alone.\\" The conscious crafting of government policy that deliberately promotes the interests of a certain sector of the economy has a name, and it ain't capitalism. It's \\"mercantilism.\\" A little more precision here would have gone a long way in categorizing the true nature of everything he otherwise ties together so well.<br /><br />As Lind's and other books show, Texas is a sweet target these days. I'm not convinced that the oil business is necessarily unique in the kinds of power and influence it has managed to acquire in government (for example, I recommend Linda Chavez's new \\"[[ASIN:1400052602 Betrayal: How Union Bosses Shake Down Their Members and Corrupt American Politics]]\\" to show how liberal Democrats have been bought and paid for by Big Labor -- and Bryce should enjoy a use of Scare Caps almost as copious as his own).

It's a very good book, but it's likely to be very far from the sort of thing you're expecting. But then, King Juan Carlos of Spain's life has been very different from that of most modern royals. In a sense, this book is hardly even \\"about\\" him at all. Rather, it's an in-depth look at a transitional era in Spanish history, as well as at the man who, in many ways, was the pivot on which that transition turned. People looking for that kind of book will be rewarded here.<br /><br />Let me expand a little on what this book isn't, because I think that's important. There's not really very much in these pages about Juan Carlos' life outside the political realm. For example, the author mentions in passing toward the end of the book the king's \\"obsession with speed and with expensive sports in which he risked his life and which frequently caused him serious accidents and injuries\\" (p. 511). In most royal biographies, those kinds of things would be central to the story. Here, they're barely an aside. Likewise, Queen Sophia hardly appears here except tangentially in a political context. The Infantas and Prince Felipe show up even less. Is this book a well-rounded look at Juan Carlos as a man? No.<br /><br />But then, it doesn't seem like it's intended to be. What this book is, as I said, is a look at the king's role in helping Spain move from the Francoist dictatorship to the current popular democracy. That role was a central one -- not only at key moments like dismantling the 1981 coup attempt, but also in slowly, quietly, and yet unrelentingly keeping in check the forces that wanted to maintain Francoism even after the Caudillo's death in 1975.<br /><br />In telling this story, Paul Preston has produced a well-researched and well-sourced book that at times is almost overwhelming with its depth and detail. This is a book thick with names, dates, meetings, quotations ... I frankly found it slow going at times. Around page 300, I found myself asking (as I'm sure the people of Spain asked at the time), \\"Isn't Franco dead YET?!\\" Preston's discussion of the controversy about legalizing the Communist Party of Spain similarly seemed to go on for a really long time. And how many times did he need to repeat that the adolescent Juan Carlos' wishes were not consulted in the high-level negotiations between his father and Franco over how he was to be educated?<br /><br />A bit of familiarity with Spanish history and government would be useful to the reader too. Perhaps Preston assumes his reader has already read his biography of Franco, since he's pretty thin on what exactly the Spanish Civil War was all about, why Alfonso XIII had to leave Spain, and what precisely the oft-mentioned principles of the *Movimiento* really were. Similarly, Preston is quick to throw out names, events, and acronyms without always taking the time to explain who or what they are, or why (or if) they matter.<br /><br />Yet ultimately, all the depth, all the detail, all the exhaustive documentation has produced a volume that may be, at least in English, the definitive look at King Juan Carlos and his role in the restoration of Spain's monarchy and democracy. Preston emphasizes the weight of the king's personal sacrifice throughout his life in order to put Spain back on a solid democratic footing, and the truly central role he did (and does) play in that process. As he notes on page 474, for example, if the king had chosen to support the 1981 coup, there's no question it would have succeeded. That he chose not to support it doomed it to failure.<br /><br />The world of royal biography -- especially biography of still-living or recently-deceased figures -- is filled with shallow puffery and fawning adulation. When something different comes along, fans of royalty as well as serious historians should snap it up. This volume definitely falls into that category -- not only for its value as a work of history, but also as proof of how monarchy can and ought to be a force for good, even in an era which has tended to turn its back on that form of government. As a noted political commentator wrote following the collapse of the 1981 coup attempt (quoted on page 488), \\"Whilst we Spaniards thought that we deserved something better than a king, it turns out that we have a king that we don't deserve.\\"for its value as a work of history, but also as proof of how monarchy can and ought to be a force for good, even in an era which has tended to turn its back on that form of government.

About this time, the person you're talking to is giving you an odd look, and you close lamely with \\"You'd just have to see it. It's really funny.\\"<br /><br />But the thing is, it IS really funny. I gave it to my lovely bride as a birthday present after she kept returning to it at the store and laughing at one image after another. Now, we're taking turns browsing through it again and again. \\"Sleep with one eye open, mother.\\" \\"Princess Gwyneth's money was on Puff.\\" Great stuff.<br /><br />\\"Bitter with Baggage\\" kind of reminds me of the Monty Python fish-slapping dance sketch: it's a good test of whether someone has even a rudimentary sense of humor. If they do, they're sure to get at least a chuckle out of this, and maybe a lot more.	2004-08-31

Ian Carmichael richly deserves the raves he has received for his performance here. His narrative was quite easy to listen to, and the voices he gave the characters seemed appropriate and not exaggerated or affected. He brought some beloved characters to aural life, and I could have listened for a lot longer than the relatively brief length of this pair of CDs.<br /><br />If there's a drawback here, it's the actual stories that were chosen for this set. Without giving anything away (for the sake of mystery-lovers who may not be familiar with the outcome of the mysteries here), I'll note that I've always found \\"Striding Folly\\" and \\"The Haunted Policeman\\" among the more unsatisfying Wimsey stories. The first one seems to end well short of a proper finish, while the second, told mostly through a policeman's recollections to Lord Peter, violates the old writers' rule about \\"show them, don't tell them.\\" These weaknesses are somewhat balanced out, however, by merits and pure charm of \\"Talboys,\\" which I understand was Sayers' final Lord Peter story. Like the novel \\"Busman's Honeymoon,\\" this story gives the reader a close look at his lordship's private life as well as his mystery-solving skills. Seeing him amid his family this way is a wonderful final image for this popular sleuth.	2004-08-31

I doubt it's likely to change either side's mind about much.<br /><br />Unlike many of the pundits and pontificators who have written pro- or anti-Bush tomes, Bill Sammon has the advantage of being an actual working journalist. And so the book he's produced not only is a well-told and generally interesting story, but is also enlivened by a judicious use of well-placed sources, on- and off-the-record interviews, and the kind of inside access that reminded me of Bob Woodward's \\"Bush at War\\" or \\"Plan of Attack.\\"<br /><br />I won't list the book's solidly pro-Bush view as a weakness, since that's more a matter of opinion. One thing I did consider a weakness was Sammon's long, long sections recounting Saddam Hussein's biography or covering in exhaustive detail Dan Rather's sycophantic interview of Hussein shortly before the second gulf war. Those sections felt like padding in a book that already had relatively large print and wide leading. Did Sammon's contract say the book had to be over 300 pages? Also, why no index? I was reminded of the (possibly apocryphal) story of a bill introduced in the British Parliament mandating capital punishment for authors who don't include indices in non-fiction books. Sammon should beware!<br /><br />What I found especially strong, on the other hand, were the author's harrowing recounting of violent anti-Bush protests in Portland, Oregon, in 2002; the Paul Wellstone memorial service; and \\"the ultimate road trip,\\" Bush's Thanksgiving, 2003, visit to US troops in Iraq.<br /><br />It's the nature of the game today that anti-Bush books -- even the more scurrilous ones -- will be greeted in the media with a respect that pro-Bush books like this one never will. Each side is no doubt speaking to itself more than to the other or to the increasingly small number of undecideds. By the standards of what this book sets out to do, it is a well-sourced and well-argued work. It assembles an argument for reelecting George W. Bush in November. If you're a Bush fan, you're sure to agree. If you aren't, you won't. That's about as straightforward as it gets.ubt speaking to itself more than to the other or to the increasingly small number of undecideds.

I would particularly recommend Jean Francois Revel's \\"Anti-Americanism\\" and Kenneth Timmerman's \\"The French Betrayal of America\\" as more in-depth explorations of some of Jed Babbin's central topics. But if you don't have time to read those, then \\"Inside the Asylum\\" is a decent brief alternative. And given Babbin's experience and access (many quotes from key international leaders are introduced with the phrase \\"He told me...\\"), there is a fair amount of interesting and useful original reporting.<br /><br />International affairs are a subject Americans as a whole don't seem to pay much  attention to (except when we're being shot at). And so while most of us have a vague sense that there's something not quite right about the United Nations any more, it may be hard to articulate quite what that is. Babbin lays it all out, and makes clear his conviction that ultimately, the UN isn't \\"fixable\\" any more. A more radical -- in the original sense of \\"to the root\\" -- solution is called for, and Babbin offers his ideas.<br /><br />Babbin makes a pretty strong case that there's nothing wrong with US foreign policy that submitting it to the control of the UN would repair, and nothing good about US policy that would be rendered better still by gaining UN approval for it. While the ground he covers may not be entirely new, the author presents his argument with thoroughness and style.  It's a case that defenders of the United Nations need to -- and are conspicuously failing to -- address.	2004-08-24

Indeed, from the presidency to local school boards, it's hard to find any political arena where the forced-dues-fueled Big Labor political machine isn't a -- or *the* -- most significant power.<br /><br />In fact, Big Labor's political power dwarfs that of corporations, the various \\"special interests,\\" and even the political parties themselves. The authors give us chapter and verse, figures, footnotes, and lots of disturbing stories. The special legal privileges enjoyed by Big Labor, up to and including immunity from prosecution for committing acts of violence, should be especially disturbing to anyone who believes in a level playing field.<br /><br />It's a shame that this book probably won't get the attention it deserves. Anyone who doubts that the political game is by and large a fixed one needs to open these pages and discover that far more than Big Oil, Skull and Bones, or various other alleged Illuminati \\"running the country,\\" the hands really pulling the strings belong to the labor union bosses.	2004-08-24

The bestupidification, so to speak, of America and the abandonment of rationalism and other Enlightenment values is a topic that sore needs to be addressed. And while some, even many, parts of this book score devastating hits on these topics, it ultimately is sunk by one, fairly gaping, failure.<br /><br />As I say, the good parts of this book are, in fact, quite good. Francis Wheen's broadsides against self-help gurus, UFO enthusiasts, New Age devotees, religious fundamentalism of all stripes, \\"the enfeebling legacy of post-modernism\\" (p. 111), and other signs of what blogger Billy Beck notably (but among others too) has labeled \\"the Endarkenment\\" are long overdue strikes against irrationality, credulity, and the abandonment of both history and standards. His expos&eacute; of the ways Western intellectuals, writers, and politicians have pandered to Islamic extremism is especially valuable and timely.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the author's presentation falls short in one key area, one that renders other reviewers' criticisms of his erratic organization almost irrelevant: his blanket rejection of the free market and capitalist economics generally. At first, I feared that saying \\"Wheen's fine except for this one thing\\" would reveal a blind spot of my own as much as any of his. And clearly, there is a certain validity in his arguments against parts of Reaganite/Thatcherite economic models, the excesses of the internet bubble, and other similar topics. But I'm less concerned about the \\"blind spot\\" charge now because a surprisingly large portion of \\"Idiot Proof\\" is devoted to an attack on business, the market, and believers in free-market economics.<br /><br />Wheen throws the baby out with the bathwater when he flatly equates \\"the 'free market'\\" (the scare-quotes are his) with belief in astrology, calling it \\"an equally imaginary cosmic dispensation whose methods and purposes were ultimately beyond human understanding or challenge\\" (p. 120). For Wheen to argue, as he's apparently doing, that Ludwig von Mises, say, is equivalent to Erich von D&auml;niken, or that Adam Smith's [[ASIN:0553585975 The Wealth of Nations]] is no more authoritative than the late Jeane Dixon's daily astrology columns, well, that's just ... irrational. So much of Wheen's book is devoted to this anti-market case, and he presents it so forcefully, that ultimately, \\"anti-Enlightenment\\" translates to little more than \\"what Francis Wheen doesn't like.\\" I should note, too, that the endorsement quotations on the back cover and the description of this book on the dust jacket flaps mention none of this part of his argument -- though, as I say, it takes up a lot of his book.

And give the man credit, he's done it. More than that, he even makes a case for Arthur as -- if still not quite memorable, let alone important -- at least somewhat interesting.<br /><br />Karabell's challenge was made all the greater by the shadows surrounding Arthur's personal life. Not only did Arthur prefer it that way himself (p. 108), but most of his personal papers were destroyed shortly after his death. Consequently, Arthur the man is a little thin in these pages (\\"thin\\" being an adjective probably never applied to Arthur himself during his lifetime). But while anyone looking for People Magazine-style \\"hidden secrets\\" about our twenty-first president is bound to be disappointed, the author more than makes up for this with a fine capsule portrayal of the Gilded Age and its politics. This is important, for Arthur was very much a man and a politician of his time.<br /><br />Indeed, the most noteworthy part of Arthur's term in office was his own transformation from \\"Gentleman Boss\\" to simply \\"Gentleman.\\" Despite his history as the veritable poster boy of spoils-system, backroom machine politicking, Arthur \\"grew in office,\\" as we'd say today, into perhaps one of the best men to help shepherd through important civil service reforms. Karabell argues, I think convincingly, that the new political culture Arthur helped create still affects us today.<br /><br />Chester Alan Arthur wasn't a crusader or a firebrand. He wasn't driven by a lust for power or glory. In fact, Karabell describes him as perhaps America's most reluctant president -- a man who never in his life wanted to be chief executive. He slipped back into obscurity almost as soon as he left office, and if anything is even more forgotten today. But \\"in an age of low expectations, he was more than satisfactory\\" (p. 139). That the author is able to make that case, not only convincingly but interestingly and even sometimes entertainingly as well, is a credit to him as well as to his subject.\\"in an age of low expectations, he was more than satisfactory\\" (p. 139).

But it is without question a by-and-large sympathetic look at &quot;the un-Kennedys&quot; through several generations.<br /><br /> For this book, as indeed, it seems, for the Bushes themselves, the focus is on family more than on politics per se (for example, it seemed like we had barely finished the 1988 presidential election before the authors were starting to discuss the 1992 campaign). The Schweizers are pretty thorough in chronicling the family's position at the center of a vast network of extended relatives, friends, business contacts, and government officials around the world, and at showing how members of the family are more than willing to tap those contacts for both political and personal use. Again, the fact that the authors don't see that network as ipso facto conspiratorial sets this title apart from many of the others on the shelf. But it's nice to take a holiday from all the rhetoric sometimes.<br /><br /> As other reviewers have noted, there are a number of errors and repetitions. For example, a story about Robert Mossbacher meeting with Prescott Bush is told in the context of both the 1964 (p. 157) and 1970 (p. 201) elections. While these suggest another pass or two by the editor's comb might have been useful, they don't fundamentally undermine the whole work.<br /><br /> The most useful functions of &quot;The Bushes&quot;, I think, are twofold. The first is the light it shines on the importance of the family, as such, to the Bushes, and how essential characteristics wax and wane, though still present, through the years. George W. comes across as an uncharacteristically cause-driven member of the family -- whereas his father &quot;41&quot; is described as a man of no particular ideology (p. 279), who distrusts the power of ideas (p. 374), and who was never really quite able to answer the question of what he wanted to do when he became president (p. 356).<br /><br /> The second interesting point is the access the authors were given to family members and close friends, and the uncharacteristic willingness of those people to discuss things the Bushes usually keep very close to the vest. Even readers who are less willing to look favorably on the Bush clan should find some value or use in these insider accounts.<br /><br /> Though the Bushes profess to hate &quot;the D word,&quot; there's no question that they have surpassed the Adams, Taft, or Kennedy families as America's premier political dynasty. Students of American politics have reason to want to get to know them, and this book is, if not flawless, one of the better (and almost certainly the least grudge-bearing) ways to do that yet published.distrusts the power of ideas (p. 374), and who was never really quite able to answer the question of what he wanted to do when he became president (p. 356). <br />  <br /> The second interesting point is the access the authors were given to family members and close friends, and the uncharacteristic willingness of those people to discuss things the Bushes usually keep very close to the vest.

And while I found the author's blend of history and memoir an interesting approach, the book is finally unsatisfying. It certainly doesn't live up to the hyperbolic reviews.<br /><br /> As someone with an interest in Virginia and the Shenandoah Campaign as well as (to a small degree) farming and rural issues, I'd hoped &quot;Battlefield&quot; would be some combination of, say, Gene Logsdon and William C. Davis. Unfortunately, it's not quite either, and certainly not both. While it may be possible to say Peter Svenson has written the definitive history of the battle of Cross Keys, that's more a reflection on the lack of alternatives. Certainly his discussion of the battle is comprehensive, with extensive quotations from period journals and participants' reports and diaries. The thinner side is Svenson's chronicle of his own farming experiences. Apart from some interesting reflections on old barns, the village's run-down former tavern, and one or two other sections, I never really got the sense that we were experiencing Svenson's farming life on much more than a surface level. We learn a lot about cleaning and restoring old farm equipment, but far less about any sort of personal relationship with the land, or what being a landholder means to the author. When he declares at the end that he will never throw away the battlefield of which he has custody, the statement is almost surprising in its emotion.<br /><br /> The history of the battle is a constant presence in the farm's modern story, and so the two halves of the narrative do fit together to some extent. But while the author makes a good attempt, the blend ultimately never quite &quot;sets.&quot;	2004-07-29
573861:US	53058008	RK9INWXUG7WVX	0766017834	762609339	Pearl Harbor: Deadly Surprise Attack (American Disasters)	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Decent summary, but nothing special	Pearl Harbor: Deadly Surprise Attack is part of the American Disasters series, a group of juvenile-literature titles intended to introduce elementary-age kids to momentous negative events in American history. As an introduction, this is a decent enough title, I suppose. But it's really nothing to get excited about, and probably shouldn't displace other similar works on the subject.<br /><br /> Author Therese De Angelis strives to place the attack within the political and military context of the era, particularly Japanese expansion in the Far East and American reactions to it. The book's one map illustrates the Pacific, and labels Hawaii, the U.S. mainland, and Japan, but none of the other nations mentioned in the text. And while there's one aerial photo of the Pearl Harbor naval base, there's no map of either the harbor or of Oahu generally. I found this probably the book's most serious shortcoming.<br /><br /> While the general portrait of the planning, execution, and aftermath of the attack are competently told, there are a number of small mistakes that mar the narrative. One paragraph on page 13, for example, mentions that the U.S. Air Force had bases in Hawaii, although in fact the U.S.A.F. wasn't founded as an independent service until after the war. And in a chart of &quot;Other Military Disasters&quot; at the end of the book, the Boston Massacre and the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution are included. Those may be many things, but was the resolution itself a &quot;disaster&quot;? Was the massacre &quot;military&quot;?<br /><br /> More seriously, De Angelis writes on page 15, &quot;Most experts who study World War II agree that Yamamoto greatly misjudged how fiercely Americans would react to an American attack.&quot; In fact, Yamamoto probably understood better than anyone in the Japanese senior command what the American response would entail, and had the fewest illusions about what his nation was facing as a consequence. Oddly, toward the end of her book, De Angelis states that the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency and the formation of the Department of Defense resulted from the Pearl Harbor attack, but then comments that the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were *not* direct results of the attack.<br /><br /> On the whole, this book may be a fair way for parents or teachers to help children get a general idea of what happened at Pearl Harbor and why. But anyone wanting more than the basics will need to look elsewhere.Angelis states that the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency and the formation of the Department of Defense resulted from the Pearl Harbor attack, but then comments that the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were *not* direct results of the attack. <br />  <br /> On the whole, this book may be a fair way for parents or teachers to help children get a general idea of what happened at Pearl Harbor and why.

I've enjoyed Riordan's previous novels, including the non-Tres [[ASIN:0553579975 Cold Springs]], and am ready to declare he's the one novelist whose next work I'm always anxiously awaiting. After reading Southtown, I think I have to say my single favorite sentence in the entire work is the one at the end of the About the Author section: Rick Riordan \\"lives in San Antonio ... where he is at work on the next novel in the Tres Navarre series.\\"<br /><br /> I'm looking forward to that one because, unfortunately, Southtown didn't quite slake my thirst for another great Tres adventure. In [[ASIN:0553579940 The Devil Went Down to Austin]], the last Tres novel, Riordan introduced the technique of departing from Tres' first-person narrative from time to time to give the reader information Tres himself never saw. Now, in Southtown, about half the story is told in omniscient third-person. Only Tres' own scenes are told in his own voice.<br /><br /> This technique allows Riordan to do the kind of psychological exploration he did in Cold Springs. But it makes for a lot less Tres than many of his fans might like -- especially since this book already struck me as fairly brief relative to the other books in the series (it can't just have been my eagerness to read the story that let me finish the book in just a few hours over two evenings), and perhaps a little hurried. At one point, I found myself wondering whether Riordan is getting bored with Tres Navarre. After all, Conan Doyle came to hate Sherlock Holmes and was eager to push him over Reichenbach Falls so he could move on to writing other things. Riordan seems to be exploring different ways to convey psychological tension and suspense, which is great. But as a fan, I'm hoping Tres isn't getting in his way.<br /><br /> That's not to say this is a bad book. Certainly Tres fans won't want to pass it up. I've mentioned in a review of another Tres Navarre title that it's nice to see him maturing as a person (in his world) and a character (in ours), and both those processes continue in Southtown. Many of the supporting characters from earlier books are back, but Tres' relationships with them have evolved in subtle -- or sometimes less subtle -- ways. And the resolution of this story suggests even bigger changes to come in the future.<br /><br /> Southtown is a fine story and a good entry in a high-quality series. But it fell just a little bit short in paying off the eagerness with which I awaited it. So while I again find myself looking forward to the next Tres Navarre novel, I'm hoping the author isn't feeling compelled to turn them out too quickly. There haven't been any bad (or even so-so) Riordan books yet, but in my opinion the best Navarre books have been *really* good, and that's what I'm hoping to see again.maturing as a person (in his world) and a character (in ours), and both those processes continue in Southtown.

Few of those reviews sounded at all like they were talking about the same book I read. If you're willing to set aside knee-jerk assumptions -- if you have them -- about the meretriciousness of the Bush Administration, and also ignore the unfortunate and loaded word \\"betrayal\\" in the title (a point I'll get back to in a moment), there's actually quite a bit of important reporting going on here. Kenneth Timmerman should be thanked for uncovering it and bringing it to our attention.<br /><br />One area where this book could have been stronger is in explaining more thoroughly how French actions in the run-up to the Iraq war were consistent with that nation's political culture. I think this is a critical point ... and while I was glad to see it mentioned finally in the author's discussion of Dominique de Villepin and his devotion to Napoleon Bonaparte, hero of megalomaniacs everywhere ... I wish this point had been given more prominence. Here, a title like Nadeau and Barlow's [[ASIN:1402200455 Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong: Why We Love France but Not the French]] is a very useful companion. The general context of Timmerman's insights -- for example, his flat statement that the French \\"have consistently favored authoritarian regimes over democracy, not just in the third world but also in Europe\\" (p. 253) -- would have been harder to understand without having already read that other book.<br /><br />Even without that grounding, however, Timmerman lays out a strong case for why the French -- and especially President Jacques Chirac -- were so adamant in opposing attempts to put the screws on Saddam Hussein. He charts the long and tortuous history of French investment in Iraq, as well as Chirac's personal, decades-long friendship with Saddam. Chirac, whom Timmerman tags as \\"the head of the unofficial 'Iraq Lobby' in France\\" since the mid-1970s (p. 43), comes across as absolutely the worst -- from Bush's standpoint (or best, from Saddam's) -- person to be running France at this time. His motivations are complex, ranging from his desire to keep France separate from the U.S. and a key player in world events ... to his oft-repeated conviction that he speaks for \\"eighty percent\\" of the world's population ... to the simple and mercenary fact that he has long received kickbacks from corporations doing business in Iraq. \\"Chirac knew that France would never get the same kinds of deals from a free Iraqi government\\" (p. 242), and so he was willing to sink France and America's centuries-long partnership in order to protect and defend a savage dictator.<br /><br />In sum, Timmerman makes a pretty ironclad case that French opposition to military action against Saddam was based less on high-minded rejection of war (though, of course, the French are hardly capable of waging war any more [p. 24]) than on a self-interested devotion to commercial advantage and geo-political positioning. And while we may find this outrageous, I'm not convinced \\"Betrayal\\" is really the right word. It implies France has some sort of obligation to the U.S., or that the French \\"sold us out\\" somehow. And despite Timmerman's frequent use of \\"marriage\\" as a metaphor for the long partnership between the two nations, I don't think either implication really applies. As Lord Palmerston noted, nations have no permanent friends, only permanent interests. If French and American interests diverged over Iraq, it may be regrettable but it probably doesn't constitute \\"betrayal.\\"<br /><br />But even if you don't agree with that element of Timmerman's conclusions, the facts he uncovers and the details he lays out are the important, and timely, part of this book. Rather than raging about \\"freedom fries\\" and how many Frenchmen it takes to defend Paris, people seeking to understand the why and the how of this episode in diplomacy could do a lot worse thanto look deeply into the picture Kenneth Timmerman has painted.Kenneth Timmerman has painted.	2004-07-14

Bush, I was a little down on the idea of journalists attempting to write history. But Joel Achenbach, whose work I've enjoyed in The Washington Post for some time, has restored my faith. &quot;The Grand Idea&quot; is both a well-researched work of history and an enjoyable story of a side of The Father of Our Country we seldom see. Americans seem to love books about the founders, and this is one that will repay reading with both entertainment and learning.<br />Achenbach has taken a relatively obscure episode in George Washington's life -- a trip to his western holdings in 1784 -- and teased out of it (validly, I believe) connections to larger themes surrounding America's growth and development. Washington saw the Potomac not only as a potential commercial artery (and a source of personal profit), but also a means of binding together the relatively settled east with the frontier west. In Washington's mind, the high-minded and national blended with the pecuniary and the personal. Achenbach manages to keep a light tone while dealing not only with the General's statistics-laden and just-the-facts prose, but also with his evasions and even, frankly, hypocrisies.<br />Once Washington died, some of the momentum went out of the Potomac development schemes. The same is unfortunately true, to a degree, of Achenbach's story. Without the figure of Washington and the narrative of his travels and ideas, the book begins to wander a bit. The unfolding development of the Potomac canal, including the story of the B&amp;O versus C&amp;O rivalry, is interesting but unfocused, while the Civil War on the Potomac -- worthy of books in and of itself -- felt rushed. Having lived for about ten years, off and on, in the D.C. suburbs, I found the discussion of the modern Potomac and its place in the Washington metroplex a fun coda, but I wonder if other readers will respond the same way.<br />In spite of this slight loosening of the narrative bonds in the latter parts of the book, I still recommend &quot;The Grand Idea&quot; highly. As entertainingly-written history, it should be very accessible to general readers. If you dragged around McCullough's &quot;John Adams,&quot; for example, you should definitely reward yourself with some Joel Achenbach. At the same time, it's still a rigorous enough work of history that specialist readers can feel safe in checking it out too. And that's not a bad balance for a book to strike.s slight loosening of the narrative bonds in the latter parts of the book, I still recommend &quot;The Grand Idea&quot; highly.

Count me in among those who collect presidential gravesites. Though I've only been to eight so far (plus two, Nixon's and Reagan's, before they were, um, occupied), I'm looking forward to visiting others when I get the chance. When I do, this will be the ideal, even essential, guidebook.<br />I thoroughly agree with Douglas Brinkley's argument, in the Afterword to this book, that there's nothing morbid about hunting down presidential resting places. Rather, it's a way to connect with American history as well as contemplate the ends to which we all must come. I'm sure that for some, given our troubling tendency toward sanctifying the office and the men in it, it can mean more than that. But the estimable Brian Lamb doesn't fall into that trap. And for that, he should be commended.<br />Each president listed here receives a brief mention of his term in office, with more focus on the circumstances of his death and burial. Comprehensive directions to the site and several photographs round out each listing. It's an excellent presentation, entertaining and informative all at once. I highly recommend it even to those who haven't (yet) become an official &quot;collector.&quot; It's an interesting and fun way to learn more about our country and the men who have led our government.	2004-07-04

Hornfischer's retelling of the Battle of Samar is that the men of the tin cans deserve our thanks and appreciation too.  As does Hornfischer himself, for producing this engrossing book.<br />&quot;The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors&quot; is a work of meticulous history. Thoroughly researched and filled with first-hand tales from men on both sides of the conflict, this is a textbook, so to speak, example of how this kind of history should be done. At the same time, it's also a great story, wonderfully told. Hornfischer's narrative skills are impressive, and the action, characterization, and pacing here match or exceed any war-at-sea novel you're likely to pick up. If there was one place where the story seemed to drag a little, it was in the recounting of the experiences of survivors on life rafts after the battle. But that may be due in part to the fact that the experience itself was hardly action-packed. Plus (intending no disrespect to the brave men on those rafts), one survival-at-sea story is a lot like another, and I've read a number of them. But even this is hardly a drawback, so strong is the rest of the book.<br />On the whole, this book fully deserves the many raves it's been receiving. It covers all the bases: not only shining a thorough light on a sometimes-overlooked corner of the war, but doing so in a way that's both historically solid and narratively riveting. Serious historians and casual readers alike should definitely treat themselves to this one.	2004-07-02

Bush, and I'm generally a fan of the series and the approach. Designed to be summary overviews, writers are forced to choose key elements and facts from their subject's lives and (ideally) extrapolate them into a portrait that, while not exhaustive in the details, at least gives the reader an idea of who he was, why he did what he did, and how it matters to history. Good writers in this series have managed to pull this off. Others haven't done so well. Unfortunately, Tom Wicker's contribution is one of the latter.<br />The first tip-off, of course, is Wicker himself. As another reviewer points out -- absolutely correctly -- journalism and biography are different skill sets. It may be too much to ask a journalist who has spent years covering his subject up close to then turn around and have the kind of analytical distance a good bio really requires. This isn't to say a biographer can't have opinions. But they shouldn't be *a priori* ones, and it's too easy to suspect Wicker of having had his mind made up about GHWB before he started to write.<br />Still, Wicker does hit on many of the major themes of Bush's life -- ones other biographers have identified as well: his sense of *noblesse oblige,* his lifetime of high achievement in most everything he's tried, his friendliness, his history of &quot;running to the right&quot; and then governing from the center. Much of this he interprets as signs of overweening ambition, ruthlessness in destroying opponents, and a desire, above all, to be president of the United States. He paints Bush as a man who played at being conservative because he needed to in order to win election, who swallowed his pride and his centrist principles to serve uncomplainingly under Reagan, but who was unable to win the loyalty of conservatives who anyway tanked the GOP's chances with their divisive 1992 convention in Houston.<br />Along the way, Wicker recounts many of the highlights of Bush's years as veep and in the White House -- not only Desert Storm and the '92 election (though he devotes the most space to those), but also half-forgotten episodes like the John Tower confirmation fight and the Panama invasion. He also devotes a good deal of time to a what-did-he-know-and-when-did-he-know-it of Bush's role in Iran-Contra. All of this is decent history, and of course belongs in any biography of George Bush. But it seemed as much like a chance for Wicker to rehearse old grudges against, and take swipes at, Reagan and the Republicans. This is another problem with writing biographies of your contemporaries.<br />As a general rule, the Penguin Lives series is a good way to get a quick thumbnail portrait of the men and women featured in its books. But they're not of uniform quality, and some, like this volume, will definitely leave you wanting more. George H.W. Bush strikes me as an interesting historical figure whose legacy (like J.Q. Adams' or William Howard Taft's) will be seen as coming from someplace other than his years in the White House. There's certainly room for a short summary biography of him, but this title isn't quite it.ny of the highlights of Bush's years as veep and in the White House -- not only Desert Storm and the '92 election (though he devotes the most space to those), but also half-forgotten episodes like the John Tower confirmation fight and the Panama invasion.

My fear is that people will see it as just one more &quot;expos&eacute;&quot; of the evil right-wingers and their malevolent influence on the country.<br />If that's what you're looking for, you're bound to be disappointed. This is, in fact, a thoroughly researched and marvelously fair look at the rise of conservatism as a political force in America. More than that, it's a fascinating look at why America is a fundamentally conservative place, and why even liberal Democrats -- on the far Left by U.S. standards -- would be centrists, or even conservatives themselves, in Europe. While this last may be an unpleasant idea for the American Left to have to entertain, even readers on that side of the political spectrum will find a lot in here to recommend it.<br />Especially useful, I thought, was the authors' discussion of the true role and influence of the much-maligned neo-conservatives. Far from their alleged role as the dark masterminds behind unilateralism, preemption, and other Bad Things in American foreign policy, Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that (a) the neo-cons are less influential than popularly imagined, and (b) that Bush's decisions and policies are consistent with the broad range of conservative opinion, not the product of an obscure Straussian corner of it. With all the hysterical attention given to the neo-cons these days, this part of M&amp;W's discussion struck me as refreshingly calm and reasonable.<br />With the analytical distance that comes from not being Americans themselves, Micklethwait and Wooldridge have keen insights into the successes and failures, the good and the bad, of American conservatism. And while their work is insightful and thorough, it's also well written, engrossing, and even, from time to time, flat-out funny. Its polished prose makes it easy to read, and the balance of personalities and issues keeps it from getting mired down in obscure policy debates or analysis of election returns. I was fortunate to be able to dive into its pages for hours at a time, and seldom found myself bored or skimming.<br />From the vast sea of ink spilled on the Iraq War, the American Empire, Halliburton, Karl Rove, the neo-cons, Texas, and other evils -- plus George W. Bush's apparent ability to be simultaneously bottomlessly stupid and an evil genius -- every so often, a real gem floats to the surface. &quot;The Right Nation&quot; is one of those gems.

Books	3	15	15	N	N	1776 and all that	I read this book alongside &quot;The Secret Lives of the U.S. Presidents&quot; by Cormac O'Brien (2004). The two books obviously have a lot in common, aiming as they do to reveal the &quot;secrets&quot; about our Chief Executives and demonstrate that they all have, or had, their flaws, their quirks, and probably more than their fair share of general weirdness. The two books tell many of the same stories, quote many of the same excerpts from the Nixon tapes, and even make the same obvious &quot;joke&quot; that James Monroe should have shown more originality than to die on July 4, since John Adams and Thomas Jefferson had already done that act. And they share the same People Magazine-style focus on personality and scandal ahead of questions of political or historical significance.<br />However, two things make &quot;Hail to the Chiefs&quot; a better book than &quot;Secret Lives...&quot;. One is Barbara Holland's ability as a writer. Her narrative style -- as opposed to O'Brien's short-attention-span-theater reliance on short sections, text boxes, and lots of subheads and pull quotes -- makes this a much easier book to really settle into and enjoy. Her reliance on clever comments in her footnotes suggests too much time spent reading Sellar and Yeatman, or perhaps Richard Armour, but this is something the reader can get used to.<br />The other thing that makes this a much stronger book is illustrated by the discussion of allegations that Thomas Jefferson fathered children by his slave Sally Hemmings. This is one of those stories that &quot;everyone knows&quot; is true now, and O'Brien repeats it as a flat fact. Holland, however, devotes three whole pages to laying out the whole story, culminating in the truth that DNA testing in fact showed that while *some of* Hemmings' children were sired by *a* Jefferson male, they also explicitly proved that Thomas Jefferson himself *was not* the father. Holland, in short, seems to have a commitment not only to telling a good story, but also to getting the story straight.  (Oddly, however, she seems to suggest that FDR used his wheelchair and his polio as campaign assets, though my understanding always was that those facts were largely kept from the American people, and certainly not emphasized for political purposes.)<br />Unfortunately, Barbara Holland shares one final trait with Cormac O'Brien, and that's her inability to retain her breezy objectivity and sense of comic remove when it comes to modern presidents. Nixon sends her right off the rails, her discussion of Ford can be summed up with the words &quot;he's dumb,&quot; and, after starting by saying how much everyone loves Reagan, her summary of his term is over-the-top with mocking praise, filtered through the standard, predictable, &quot;he was an actor playing a president&quot; lens. The discussion of Bill Clinton is mostly about how much other people hated him, and how irrational they all were. You can imagine what she says about George W. Bush, and you'd probably be right.<br />The final paragraph of my O'Brien review applies here too: Maybe this book is good for a laugh or two, and it's always nice to pare down the monarchical pretensions of the modern presidency (regardless of the occupant of the office or his party) a bit.

But the corollary of this is that you actually have to pay off the tease by making the offer or topic worth the interest generated by the eye-catching headline. This book doesn't do that at all.<br /><br />Far from delivering the goods on \\"the secret lives of the U.S. presidents,\\" a more accurate title for this book would probably have been \\"Trivial facts about men you've probably never heard of anyway ... and if you *have* heard of them, then you've most likely already encountered this information, and so don't bother wasting your time here.\\"<br /><br />As someone who enjoys history and thinks it's important, and who has spent a lot of time studying the presidency and American presidents, it would be easy for me to go off on a rant about the National Enquirerization of history, with its focus on personality and scandal at the expense of anything of actual significance. I mean, what's the point of knowing John Tyler sired fifteen children if you've otherwise no idea who John Tyler is or why (or if) he matters?<br /><br />But more relevant to this review are the author's rehashing of tired facts (the acknowledgements at the end thank several collections of presidential stories but give no evidence of actually covering any new ground), and his repeating already disproven stories. Compare, for example, O'Brien's flat statement that Thomas Jefferson fathered Sally Hemming's children with Barbara Holland's pages-long discussion, in her similar -- but generally better -- \\"[[ASIN:1579620817 Hail to the Chiefs: Presidential Mischief, Morals, and Malarkey from George W. to George W]]\\" of the fact that DNA testing showed the children were sired by a Jefferson male but emphatically *not* Thomas Jefferson himself.<br /><br />People who write chatty books dealing the dish on presidents often break down when they have to write about the Chief Executives they themselves remember, and Cormac O'Brien is no different. As other reviewers have noted, O'Brien's breezy objectivity fails him when it comes to writing about Nixon and (particularly) George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. It's like the entire rest of the book was a warm-up for the several pages in which he sneers at the 40th and 43rd presidents.<br /><br />Maybe this book is good for a laugh or two, and it's always nice to pare down the monarchical pretensions of the modern presidency (regardless of the occupant of the office or his party) a bit.

His writing, though vivid, is understated, and can carry as much freight, so to speak, in one or two sentences as some writers pack into entire chapter. Even on this very superficial level, this title is both riveting and educational reading.<br />But the deeper you look into this book, the more there is to uncover. I read it during a news cycle when the threat of seaborne terrorism was once again in the headlines, and it was certainly sobering to see how easily how ships in what one reviewer called &quot;the low end of the shipping industry&quot; can disappear almost at will from the world's seas, reappearing in a new port under a new name, with a new flag, and even a markedly different appearance.<br />Langewiesche's key point is that the world's oceans are an outlaw place -- in the original, literal definition of the word as outside the protection, or even beyond the reach, of law. On the high seas, each ship is to one or another degree, its own absolute monarchy. When crimes occur, where can they be prosecuted -- by whom, and under what authority? (The author's recounting of one memorable case where modern-day pirates were tried in India vividly proves his point.)<br />Law and order tend to break down at sea in another way too, as the sinking of the ferry Estonia made clear. As the ferry began to go under, Langewiesche tells how civilization fell apart under the simple and inescapable need for survival. Thieves even began stealing jewelry right off the bodies of their fellow passengers -- before themselves going to their deaths, appropriately enough. Disaster at sea provides horrible proof for how thin the veneer of civilized society really is.<br />All this makes for disturbing, as well as fascinating, reading. The ocean is a world where few humans feel at home, and fewer would be able to survive for any length of time if their comfortable ships or planes were taken away from them. William Langewiesche's understated but revealing book illuminates this world in a way that should replace romantic visions with a very sobering understanding of reality.omfortable ships or planes were taken away from them.

Brands, and then launched immediately into \\"Lone Star Rising\\" by William C. Davis. As two books published on essentially the same topic, with almost identical titles, and within a few months of one another, the two books obviously have a certain amount in common. But the differences are more significant than the similarities. And while which one you prefer will be largely a matter of taste, I personally found this book, Davis' \\"...Rising,\\" a much stronger work of history.<br /><br />\\"...Nation,\\" by Brands, viewed the Texas Revolution largely through the biographies of some of its major players: Houston, Bowie, Crockett, Santa Anna, and so on. It was very much a personality-driven story. \\"...Rising,\\" on the other hand, focuses much more on the larger historical context of the Revolution -- so much so, in fact, that the personalities sometimes seem lost amid the larger picture Davis is painting. In the early sections of the book, especially, I found it sometimes hard to keep track of all the pirates, revolutionaries, and filibusterers Davis introduced into his narrative. In his defense, if such is necessary, however, I should note that Davis covered precisely those same personalities in more detail several years ago in his [[ASIN:0060930942 Three Roads to the Alamo: The Lives and Fortunes of David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis]].<br /><br />I've been debating whether to describe Davis as a \\"serious, albeit prolific,\\" historian, or a \\"prolific and serious\\" one. While he has written an awful lot of books, I've never found him to be a hack, a poor researcher, a poor writer, or tendentious in his conclusions. As I said, part of this book was so densely populated that I found it a little hard to follow. But once we got into the central narrative of the unfolding Revolution, the story was both interesting and well-informed.<br /><br />\\"Lone Star Rising\\" is not from the \\"when giants strode the earth\\" school of epic storytelling. But if you're willing to accept a little less focus on personalities in exchange for a lot more context, William C. Davis' contribution may be just the title you're looking for. Given the option, I would maybe have given this title four-and-a-half stars instead of five.

This book, first written forty years ago and re-released in 1988, is a lyrical work that focuses much on the soul and spirit of Spain and her people, as well as on the history and geography that are so much a part of that soul and spirit. It's entertaining, enlightening, and evocative -- even if you can't help but wonder how much, if any, of it is still relevant today.<br />Unfortunately, there is much merit in the Publishers Weekly criticisms of this edition. The type is indeed set very small -- and even with the wide margins on most pages, can be decidedly, if unconsciously, hard on the eyes. Interesting as the writing itself was, I sometimes found it hard to keep motoring ahead through the difficult layout. Cecilia Eales' watercolors do add a lighthearted and colorful element to the text-heavy pages, while the contemporary oil paintings, sometimes referenced in the text but often not, add an extra historical dimension. This book could have been about 50 pages longer, just by using a larger type size, with much greater prospects for readability and enjoyment.<br />In all, this is still a fine book for getting a glimpse into the heart of Spain -- at least as one non-Spanish writer saw it some time ago. Poetic and soulful as well as informative, it strikes me as a good introduction to a nation still much removed from the thoughts and experience of most Americans.	2004-06-17

With Morris's disappointing &quot;Dutch&quot; already gathering dust, a decade of effort wasted, Cannon's &quot;President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime&quot; is more and more becoming recognized as the best biography yet written of America's fortieth president.<br />This is as it should be. As Gerald Seib notes in today's Wall Street Journal, Cannon was seen even before the Gipper's election in 1980 as &quot;the journalistic world's foremost authority on Reagan.&quot; He was &quot;the only reporter Reagan knew well.&quot; In &quot;Role of a Lifetime,&quot; Cannon employs this knowledge and access without abusing it. In calling the presidency a &quot;role,&quot; Cannon doesn't join the ranks of those who (still) demean Reagan as &quot;just an actor.&quot; Instead, he provides a sophisticated look at how Reagan viewed the office: not simply the nation's premier technocrat or legislative whip, but as a position with important symbolic and inspirational functions. After the dismal Carter years, America (and the world) needed a president who understood just what Theodore Roosevelt meant by the office as a &quot;bully pulpit.&quot;<br />In recognizing Reagan's insight -- without either belittling or overpraising it -- Cannon has given himself a solid foundation on which to build a narrative rich in research, story, and understanding. People who come out of this week desiring to know more about this remarkable man and his impact on the world could do much worse than to start by reading Lou Cannon's &quot;Role of a Lifetime.&quot;	2004-06-11

But while the ubiquitous Woodward writes big, portentous books that themselves often end up affecting the debate, \\"Thirty Days\\" is a quick, journalistic snapshot that doesn't pretend to be a lot more than that. That made this a refreshing and sometimes enlightening read.<br /><br />I recently finished another title on the British PM ([[ASIN:0670033006 Tony Blair: The Making of a World Leader]] by Philip Stephens), so I felt relatively familiar with the central players in this book. Peter Stothard's quick, journalistic style introduces names and titles quickly, and while the players become clearer to us in the course of the narrative, Americans who don't have much contextual familiarity with British politicians may find themselves playing catch-up.<br /><br />Since 9/11, of course, Tony Blair himself has become more familiar to American news-watchers than any British politician since Churchill -- with the possible exception of Baroness Thatcher. Therefore, even Americans who may not be up-to-date on the Who's Who of Whitehall will probably find a lot of interest and instruction here. Not least, they will see the influence -- for good or ill -- that American politics and political pressures have in the counsels of our allies.<br /><br />Peter Stothard's book isn't a biography of Blair or a political analysis of his policies and his decisions. Instead, it's a look inside the highest reaches of British politics during one of the more eventful months in recent British history. American as well as British readers can gain a lot from the unique access Stothard enjoyed, and the useful work that came out of those thirty days.	2004-06-07

That's because Philip B. Mortenson has produced a work that should appeal not only to natural historians and biologists, but also word geeks and fans of linguistics. I commend him for bridging these very disparate worlds.<br />Divided up into short and easy-to-read sections, Mortenson covers such confusing topics (and topics that some people may not have known were different in the first place) like redwood versus sequoia, rabbit versus hare, shrimp versus prawn, sweet potato versus yam, and a great many others.<br />I always encourage, and try to acknowledge, precision in language and expression. This wide-ranging and entertaining book is both a fun read and a handy reference to have around. I recommend it to both sides of the traditional divide between the sciences and the humanities.	2004-06-07

One of the most useful aspects of this important and entertaining book is the light it sheds on how the Clintons (both of them) habitually respond to any criticism: (1) Vigorously deny it; (2) Launch ad hominem attacks on the critic; (3) Act personally victimized by the criticism (&#34;Why do they hate me?&#34;); and (4) Say the critic is obsessing over &#34;old news.&#34; Some of the reviews on this page prove their supporters have learned the script well.<br /><br />The Clintons and their scandals are hardly old news, given that she is a powerful US Senator and presumptive candidate for the presidency. Bob Tyrrell has had the Clintons' number from the beginning. And in this book, he picks up the late Barbara Olsen's torch as the writer with perhaps the clearest understanding of Hillary Clinton, her deeply radical, if deeply camouflaged, designs for our country, her lust for power, and how she intends to go about winning it.<br /><br />The problem is that the Clintons arouse such strong feelings, both pro and con, that it can be difficult to separate the facts from the *Kultursmog* (such a great word -- I've admired it for years). Tyrrell and coauthor Mark Davis have done the heavy lifting for us, giving us chapter-and-verse not only on the Clintons' Arkansas and White House years, but also Madame Hillary's journey &#34;from Methodism to Maoism&#34; (p. 120) and into the ranks of Coat and Tie Radicals. Like Olsen, Tyrrell sees the heavy hand of Saul Alinsky not only in her early radical years, but also in her approach to politics and power even today. This is enlightening and disturbing reading.<br /><br />I've always suspected that one of the things the Left hates most about Bob Tyrrell is not just that he skewers them so thoroughly, but that he has such fun doing it (Ann Coulter commits this sin too). This book &#34;was a pleasure to write,&#34; he notes on page 209, and I have no doubt he means it. It was a pleasure to read, too.

At any given moment, somewhere in the world, some station is probably broadcasting an episode of one of the three L&O series. If you're one of the many people who consider this a Good Thing, \\"Law & Order: Crime Scenes\\" is a book for you.<br />Much of the book is taken up by \\"crime scene\\" photos from the original \\"Law & Order\\" series. These photos not only illustrate the care taken by the show's actors and technicians, but are themselves often featured in the program. Serious fans will thus have fun playing \\"Name That Episode\\" with these images. While you know they're all staged, many of these photos are nevertheless rather gory and blood-spattered, and some are downright gruesome. That's why I doubt this book will be left out on the coffee table when the grandparents visit. Unless, of course, Grandma's an L&O fan too.<br />While the photos themselves are interesting (and one, at least, is surprisingly moving: the photo of Claire Kincaid [Jill Hennessy] \\"dead\\" in her car following the accident that took her out of the program), I was more intrigued by the sections that bookend them. The last part of the book consists of thumbnail biographies of L&O's principal characters. From Max Greevey and Paul Robinette all the way to Ed Green and DA Arthur Branch, series creator Dick Wolf not only explains their history on the show, but also why they were created, why they left (in real life and \\"TV life\\"), and how they progressed. While he doesn't answer any questions about a Jack-Claire affair, he does at least provide an explanation for Serena Southerlyn's changing dress and hairstyles from season to season.<br />On the front end, Wolf's introduction includes an excellent discussion of how the show was created, what he set out to do, and how well he thinks he's achieved it. This is followed by an in-depth look at the process of creating the \\"teaser,\\" the two scenes between the initial fade-in (\\"In the criminal justice system...\\") and the opening credits. Everyone involved, from the techs to the actors to the real NYPD officers monitoring things and even the corpse herself, get a chance to speak about their role in the process. It's a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at how a television production happens.<br />This book isn't really a viewers' guide to the show, and contains no episode summaries or anything like that. But many hard-core fans will no doubt get a lot out of it anyway. And even people interested in knowing how a series TV production goes from script to screen will probably enjoy the experience too.ade-in (\\"In the criminal justice system...\\") and the opening credits.

Bush just a few months later. Other Americans may simply have wondered who this man was who became Bush's closest ally in the run-up to war in Iraq and his guest during an address to Congress.<br />Either way, this biography has many of the answers those Americans may be looking for. While it is not the definitive biography of Anthony Charles Lynton Blair -- and it's obviously too early to measure his impact on UK politics, since he's still in office -- this title is nevertheless a good introduction to this major player on the world stage.<br />Stephens, a writer for the Financial Times newspaper, has had a great deal of access to Blair over the years, including personal interviews specifically for this book. It's not entirely surprising, therefore, that Stephens takes a generally positive tone with his subject. While he does not downplay Blair's weaknesses, including a number of unattractive personality traits, neither is he heavily critical of the man. He also tends to be light in his coverage of others' criticisms of Blair, except insofar as they have shaped the man himself or had a lasting impact on his political outlook or success in office.<br />No question that this book is more about personality than politics ... but I hasten to add that I think Stephens has done a fine job in showing how Blair's political words and deeds proceed consistently and logically from his personality and his underlying beliefs. Unlike Clinton, Blair does seem to have a solid set of core principles that transcend mere political expedience. Stephens argues that this in part explains Blair's ability to get along with President Bush on matters of global policy. At the same time, Blair is also a consummate and accomplished politician, who recognizes (again, as Stephens argues) that the British prime minister ultimately has little alternative *except* to do all he can to keep the UK's relationship with the US on solid footing, regardless of who is in the White House.<br />In short, this title may seem a bit too glossy and superficial to Americans who already have some degree of familiarity with British politics and Tony Blair himself. However, for those who don't, or who seek a quick refresher course, Stephens' book has a lot to argue for it. I consider myself relatively conversant with the UK's politics and government, but still learned a lot from reading this. I think other readers may find themselves reaching the same conclusion.ho recognizes (again, as Stephens argues) that the British prime minister ultimately has little alternative *except* to do all he can to keep the UK's relationship with the US on solid footing, regardless of who is in the White House.<br />In short, this title may seem a bit too glossy and superficial to Americans who already have some degree of familiarity with British politics and Tony Blair himself.

I don't think it's something Sam Donaldson is going to wish he'd had when he was skulking around the White House. And if anyone actually elected chief executive needs a book like this to find his (obligatory: \\"or her\\") way around, well, we're in worse shape than I thought. But for a general audience, it's not a bad, or time-consuming, way to get a better picture of what being president actually entails.<br /><br />I'm not entirely clear on whether this book was explicitly written for a juvenile audience (the cataloguing info doesn't seem to indicate that), but it reads that way. Some of the questions it addresses are childish (Do I have to make my own bed? Who walks my dog?) or else things the president probably need not concern himself (obligatory: \\"or herself\\") about, like how do I order a new desk chair, or do I get to keep the pens. Other sections, though, like the discussion of the president's daily schedule, the interaction with the Secret Service, and the layout and functions of various White House spaces, were pretty interesting. But does the Secret Service really refer to the \\"First Spouse,\\" or \\"FS\\"?<br /><br />\\"How to be President\\" is a quick and easy read that many people may find entertaining and broadly illuminating. I would categorize it as best suited for young adults for whom [[ASIN:0399243178 So You Want to be President? Revised and Updated Edition]] by Judith St. George (2000) is a little too lightweight. Adults looking for something with more depth, but not heavily weighted by politics, might want to check out a title mentioned in this book's bibliography, [[ASIN:0415939518 Real Life at the White House: 200 Years of Daily Life at America's Most Famous Residence]] by Claire and John Whitcomb (2002).	2004-05-20

But this book is one of the most important of them -- not only because, first published in 1946, it was pretty much the first -- but because its author, Commander Eric A. Felt, R.A.N., was the man in overall charge of the coastwatcher operation. So while this title may lack some of the first-person narrative power, the coastwatchers' stories in their own words, of books like Walter Lord's &quot;Lonely Vigil,&quot; it's still hard to beat for its strategic insights and true measure of the coastwatchers' operations and importance.<br />A man who from civilian life was familiar with the Solomons and their residents, Feldt is generous with praise for the civilians and natives involved with the coastwatcher operation. He is also a skilled writer and storyteller. The coastwatchers played a critical, if now largely forgotten (if it was ever really even known) role in the fight for control of the South Pacific. Nearly 60 years after it was first published, Cdr. Feldt's book is still an exciting and revealing contribution to their memory.	2004-05-18

Kennedy. Far from the coastwatchers being a footnote in JFK's biography, I prefer to think of JFK -- at least during these years -- as a minor bit of trivia in the far more interesting story of the coastwatchers themselves. Fishing JFK out of the drink was far from their most important contribution, either to the war effort or to history.<br /><br />I first read this book when I was in my teens, and I was captured even then by the drama of the coastwatchers and their Melanesian allies, hiding in the jungles while reporting on Japanese convoy and aircraft movements through the evocatively named &#34;Slot&#34; through the Solomon Islands. If you're familiar with Rodgers and Hammerstein's &#34;South Pacific,&#34; you already know a little about the coastwatchers, since the mission embarked on by Lt. Joe Cable and planter Emile de Becque was modeled on the true-life exploits described in this book.<br /><br />It's too bad that the exciting story of the coastwatchers is still all but unknown in the U.S. But if it's true, as Admiral Halsey said (and who are we to doubt Admiral Halsey?), that &#34;the coastwatchers saved Guadalcanal, and Guadalcanal saved the Pacific,&#34; then this well-researched, well-written, and engrossing book by Walter Lord deserves to be read by all students of the war in the Pacific.	2004-05-18

Brands is very much a &quot;kings and battles&quot; book. Heavy on drama and personality and light on sociology, anthropology, and dry statistics, Brands' book is popular history told as an adventure story. It's an exciting adventure, and Brands has done a good job telling it.<br />The &quot;kings&quot; here are the towering figures in the Texan epic: Austin, Houston, Bowie, Crockett, Travis, plus Santa Anna, Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and a host of smaller players. And the battles are epic too: Not only the literal battles of the revolution, but Austin's fight to establish and defend his colony; Santa Anna's for political control in Mexico; the Alamo; Goliad; the battle in the U.S. Congress over annexation; and finally, Governor Sam Houston's losing fight against the secessionist drive in 1861. In many ways, the early sections of this book especially are a series of biographies, tied together by the common theme of the settlement of Texas.<br />While most of these men come across as heroic, Brands' portrait of them is not unvarnished (the book isn't *that* old-fashioned). In fact, Brands shows how many of them achieved their heroic memory in spite of their failings, inadequacies, or downright unpleasantness. Similarly, I commend the author for his even-handed portrayal of Santa Anna, his unvarnished look at the slaughter that was the &quot;battle&quot; of San Jacinto (168 years ago today!) -- as well, of course, as the slaughters at the Alamo and Goliad -- and the decidedly unheroic influence of racism and nationalism on both sides of the fight.<br />I've said in other reviews that I agree with the statement that all history is ultimately biography, and &quot;Lone Star Nation&quot; is definitely personality-driven history. More &quot;serious&quot; academic historians may view that as a failing. But the general fan, looking for an exciting true story with larger-than-life characters, could do a lot worse than to settle down in these pages and discover the causes and consequences of the story in which the Alamo played such a memorable part.and &quot;Lone Star Nation&quot; is definitely personality-driven history.

Bush.&#34; That pretty much sums up &#34;Deliver Us from Evil.&#34;<br /><br />Although I'm a libertarian, my roots are in the &#34;conservative movement.&#34; I have a lot of sympathy for conservatives, sometimes against my better judgment. And I believe conservative arguments need and deserve to be cogently presented and rationally debated. I concluded my Amazon.com review of Hannity's disappointing first book with these words: &#34;C'mon, Sean. You're smart and articulate. You can do a whole lot better than this.&#34;<br /><br />Well, apparently he can't.<br /><br />A 300-plus-page book gives Hannity the opportunity to develop some insightful, thought-provoking analysis. Unfortunately, he acts out his role as George W. Bush's paladin by gliding serenely from one talk-radio totem to another, never breaking an intellectual sweat. This book is full of boilerplate lessons from Churchill and Reagan ... shopworn excerpts from Every Conservative's Book of Favorite Quotes (Adams, Burke, etc.) ... capsule summaries of middle-eastern history ... attacks on opposing viewpoints as &#34;appeasement!&#34; ... and most of all, praise to the skies for the wisdom, virtue, vision, and statesmanlike bearing of George W. Bush. (In fact, I seriously wonder whether it is President Bush, and not the Lord, whom Hannity believes will &#34;deliver us from evil.&#34;)<br /><br />Hannity's writing seems to have improved from what I can remember of his first book. He quotes other people quite a bit, so give him credit for research. And he often manages to get the right targets in his sights. But once again, I think he has failed to take advantage of the unique virtues of the medium: the chance to develop a sustained, thoughtful, and in-depth argument without being interrupted by co-hosts or forced to break for commercials.<br /><br />It's discouraging, though not surprising, to see this book doing so very well. There has got to be more to modern American conservatism than hero-worship, buzzwords, and chest-thumping nationalism masquerading as &#34;patriotism.&#34;<br /><br />Hasn't there?couraging, though not surprising, to see this book doing so very well.

Haynes and Klehr have assembled a shocking catalog of the ways in which members of the American historical profession have systematically lied -- there's no other word for it -- about the fact of Soviet espionage in the United States and the complicity of American communists in that spying.<br />Based on their pioneering work in declassified Soviet intelligence archives, as well as their familiarity with the other relevant sources, the authors show how so much of the received wisdom about this topic is fraudulent, tendentious, or worse. Even more objectionable is the length to which many of these historians are willing to go to gloss over, explain away, misinterpret, or just plain ignore the new evidence. With telling excerpts and full documentation, Haynes and Klehr take us through incidents both well known and obscure, from the Rosenbergs, Hiss, and Harry Dexter White, to the mysterious (and apparently fabricated) origins of the phrase \\"premature anti-fascists\\" and the silence over the murder of dozens of Finnish-American emigrants to Russia in the 1930s.<br />The great libertarian historian Lord Acton (of \\"Power corrupts...\\" fame) wrote that the muse of historians should not be Clio, but rather Rhadamanthus, the son of Zeus and avenger of innocent blood. By this standard, the \\"revisionist\\" historians described here stand condemned. Perhaps the most infuriating portion of this volume consist of quotes from historians like Gabriel Kolko (p. 21) and Theodore Von Laue (pp. 24-5), who justify Stalin and his murders on the grounds of his \\"remarkable human achievement\\" (Von Laue's words) and alleged devotion to building a better future for the Soviet peoples. Here truly is Isabel Paterson's \\"humanitarian with a guillotine\\"!<br />This book is an essential tool for understanding the rot at the center of the American historical profession, the American academy, and indeed much of American intellectualism generally.  Fortunately, we can take some comfort that, as Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn noted, the judgment of *history* and the judgment of *historians* is not the same thing. The crimes of Soviet communism are being better understood, in spite of the historians mentioned here. With that understanding will come understanding, too, of the moral guilt of many Americans, past and present, who aligned themselves with the Soviet \\"experiment.\\" Haynes and Klehr have done a tremendous service in exposing the depravity of those who (in the words of Tony Judt, quoted on pages 138-9) \\"thought they could save the essence of the communist 'dream' by separating it from its rotted Soviet penumbra[.

It's also a serious critique, made more so by the fact that it is not couched (unlike, say, Michael Mann's \\"Incoherent Empire\\") in the language of partisan name-calling and electoral bitterness.<br />In fact, Daalder and Lindsay's argument kind of sneaks up on you, in that the first section of the book almost ... almost ... seems pro-Bush. Unlike many of his critics, these authors are willing to give the guy a little credit for having a brain in his head and a firm, relatively well-defined, set of beliefs. They argue that the discreet facts Bush knows (citing the famous pre-election \\"pop quiz\\" of world leaders) are less important than the principles he believes, since the latter are the raison d'&eacute;tre of his policy. As they note in an important chapter titled \\"Bush's Worldview,\\" while GWB may not be able to articulate the underlying logic of his hegemonist worldview in \\"a form that would please political science Ph.D.s\\" [p. 41], those principles are deeply held and guide his thinking on strategic matters.<br />This might seem to be damning with faint praise. But it's still more of an admission than we'll get from most subscribers to the kneejerk-but-tired caricature of Bush as a puppet whose strings are pulled by the neocons (or the oil companies, or Dick Cheney, or his dad, or whoever). What it also does, however, is set up the authors' principal argument, that \\"the Bush revolution\\" can in fact be traced back to the president himself: his ideas, his declarations, and his decisions.<br />The conclusion seems to be not so much that this revolution is evil (the arguments here are utilitarian rather than moral, which isn't necessarily a bad thing) as it is poorly thought-out. The administration is surprised to discover that America's historic friends and allies don't automatically line up behind the president's priorities. That falling into disfavor with world opinion can actually have consequences for our foreign policy (and that even a \\"hyperpower\\" can't do everything by itself). That pre-emption and unilateralism don't work so well in cases like North Korea or Iran. That how to stabilize post-war Iraq should have given more thought in pre-war times. And that \\"with us or against us\\" bipolarism gets murky with countries like Pakistan or Saudi Arabia.<br />I've read a handful of books in recent weeks about America's descent into empire and this president's new direction in foreign policy. While \\"America Unbound\\" lacks the wide historic lens of Chalmers Johnson's \\"The Sorrows of Empire,\\" it is still a fine look at this president, his administration, his underlying principles, and their geopolitical consequences. Its restrained and logical tone -- unburdened by the polemical language of the Bush-hating Left -- ought to attract thoughtful and open-minded readers, and be a useful contribution to sober debate about the direction this nation is headed.r with world opinion can actually have consequences for our foreign policy (and that even a \\"hyperpower\\" can't do everything by itself).

It would have to be, to live up to its subtitle -- &quot;Understanding Middle-earth&quot; -- as Middle-earth was the life work of a remarkably productive man. But Dr. Birzer has done a fine job. He has shown us the key, I believe, to unlocking the true richness, value, and depth of Tolkien's work. And he has put together a strong argument for Tolkien's place among the most significant Christian writers of the twentieth century.<br />When I first approached this title, I was afraid it might be like &quot;The Parables of Peanuts,&quot; the well-known work that grafted more symbolism than Charles M. Schulz probably ever intended onto his classic tales of Charlie Brown and Snoopy. Or, even worse, that book (the name of which escaped me years ago) which tried to interpret &quot;Star Wars&quot; as a Christian allegory: Luke Skywalker = Protestant Christians; Han Solo = Catholic Christians; and so on.<br />Imagine my relief to discover that Dr. Birzer's work is richly grounded in Tolkien himself ... both his published works and his unpublished notes, manuscripts, and private letters. Much more than Birzer's own interpretations, what we get here are *Tolkien's* own meanings, interpretations, and intentions. That makes reading this a richly rewarding experience.<br />In my experience, the best books are the ones that I complete having compiled a new list of other titles I need to read too. &quot;Sanctifying Myth&quot; definitely fits into that category. It's a pointed reminder of all the other Christian Humanists I need to read, not to mention the (*ahem*) parts of the Tolkien bibliography itself I haven't yet read. And Dr. Birzer himself being a fine stylist as well as scholar, his name is on my list too.<br />Whether you're a Tolkien fan looking for new windows into a beloved world ... a Christian wondering whether hobbits and Elves are compatible with a Biblical worldview ... a literary critic seeking new insights ... a skeptic wondering what all the fuss is about ... or any combination of the above, I predict you'll find this a satisfying, even eye-opening read.

Even forty-odd years of Communist domination weren't able to destroy that. This worthwhile book, published in 1994, focuses on perhaps the brightest jewel of that bright city, the Prague Castle.<br />Karl Schwarzenberg, editor of this title, is a former intimate advisor to V&aacute;clav Havel and scion of a noble Austro-Bohemian family that is itself interesting and historically-significant. He has assembled a fine collection of art, photography, and narrative into a book that will satisfy people seeking a souvenir of their visit to Prague as well as historically-minded readers looking for a window into Czech history or medieval and early modern art and culture. The castle itself is thoroughly catalogued, from its ancient foundations to the modern, stylish, and unpretentious office of the president of the Czech Republic. St. Vitus's Cathedral, next door, is also covered, as are various squares, chapels, and the collection of the National Gallery at the nearby St. George's Convent.<br />In all, this book gives the reader much to admire and enjoy.

In the spring and summer, especially, outdoor leisure predominates, and the romantic illusions that we Americans treasure of the City of Lights come closest to being reality.<br />At least, that's how this book's Introduction by Noël Simsolo paints it. And I'm inclined to believe him. Certainly, Willy Ronis' very impressive photography seems to support the argument. Or, more precisely, the argument seems to support Ronis' images, since it's the images that this book is about. Ronis is an important and skilled photographer, and the Smithsonian and Motta Editore of Milan have done a fine job in selecting four dozen of his images for this book. They're a great portrayal of Paris at rest. And because the images are monochromatic, the fact that they span four decades (1947 to 1993) can easily be forgotten. Classic Paris always seems to be in black and white anyway, and Ronis' timeless, seductive work draws us in easily.	2004-03-19

Perhaps the subtitle was chosen to capitalize on the frustrations many Americans feel toward the French (&quot;freedom fries,&quot; indeed!) as a result of differences over the Iraq war. While the authors do make the differences between Us and Them quite clear in a number of key areas, the answers to &quot;love&quot; and &quot;hate&quot; have a lot more to do with personal tastes, and aren't really covered here.<br />What the authors do give us, however, is a pretty comprehensive overview of French political society, and how French history has shaped the French people's understanding of who they are and how they relate to one another. This isn't the romanticized vision of quaint caf&eacute;s in Paree and cottages in the countryside that so many English-language books about France present to us. In fact, as the authors tell us explicitly at the end of their Introduction, &quot;We did not move to France to renovate a house in Provence. What we are trying to do is renovate some ideas.&quot;<br />And renovate they did ... at least in my case. Although I consider myself relatively well informed in European history and politics, it was a revelation to me how *very* different the French are in their political and cultural makeup and outlook. It certainly put a lot of recent geo-political wrangles in a much clearer perspective. When the French disagree with American politicians on questions of war and economics, it's not just a matter of simple cussedness, self-importance, or (the talk-radio host's favorite) jealousy, but grows out of a mindset deeply rooted in French history. It may not make dealing with them any more pleasant, but at least reading this book can make them somewhat easier to understand.<br />Most eye-opening to me was the centrality of the State in French life. As the authors write, &quot;France's political culture was built around a strong penchant for absolutism, authoritarianism, centralism, and a considerable dose of intolerance&quot; [p. 315]. Things North Americans of all political stripes take more or less for granted -- like charities, local control of education and municipal affairs, property rights, and freedom of association -- are almost nonexistent in France. The kind of unquestioned obedience medieval man may have owed to the Catholic Church, modern French people have devoted to (to borrow a phrase from David Avrom Bell) the Cult of the Nation. This tendency is as deeply ingrained in the French as &quot;I did it my way&quot; individualism is in Americans. No wonder we have so much trouble understanding each other.<br />On the whole, this was an interesting, eye-opening, and very timely book. I'm still more likely to side with Noël than Cole on the question of the French. But I would recommend this title highly to everyone from fuming Freepers to new or renewed internationalists seeking a better understanding of this fascinating, infuriating, and in many ways very, very foreign country.this book can make them somewhat easier to understand.<br />Most eye-opening to me was the centrality of the State in French life.

On its own, it's just one more recitation of the crimes of &quot;the most ethical Administration in history&quot; and the lasting stain it left on this country. Unreconstructed Clintonistas have all kinds of derogatory terms for such recitation, but there is unquestionable value in it ... especially in an election year.<br />But over and above its straightforward contents, what really makes this title interesting is the author, Jason Fodeman. It's rare, in my experience, to find a teenager so articulate (especially over the course of a sustained argument) or one who can research and marshal his facts so well. The book does in fact read like it was written by a seventeen year old, but under the circumstances this is authentic, not distracting. Fodeman is clearly still finding his voice and experimenting with language and expression. How many of us were so far along at his age?<br />That's why, if Amazon.com offered this feature, I'd give the book three stars, but the author four or even four-point-five.<br />Where I think Fodeman could have done a better job is in expanding his analysis beyond his own life and mindset to include a portrayal of his peers. His general method is to digest the facts of a particular Clinton scandal, and then to reflect on how the Clintons' immoral or unethical behavior differs from the principles his parents taught him. Though his arguments from logic are valuable, I also would have liked to see more concrete evidence of how (or whether) other kids were affected by the Clintons' negative moral or ethical examples.<br />Also, I wish his editor had done something to improve Fodeman's high-school-English-class typography. For anyone not using a manual typewriter, book and magazine titles are italicized, not underlined. And the &quot;scientific&quot; practice of citing sources in parenthesis at the end of every sentence is unnecessarily distracting -- especially when the same source is cited six times in succession, as on pages 173-175. God has blessed us with footnotes, and we should make use of them.<br />On the whole, this is an interesting addition to the five-foot shelf of books decrying what blogger Billy Beck has called &quot;the Clinton Long March.&quot; Not the most ground-breaking, nor the one that will arouse the most passionate response from Slick's knee-jerk defenders, but certainly a perspective worth noting. As the reviews on this page show, reactions from both sides of the aisle are pretty much what you'd expect. Mostly, I'm looking forward to seeing whether Mr. Fodeman has anything else to write in the future.e end of every sentence is unnecessarily distracting -- especially when the same source is cited six times in succession, as on pages 173-175.

However, I found it flawed in its tone, and in its easy acceptance of Leftist dogma. More seriously, its historical perspective is too short.<br />To his credit, Mann does a fine job proving his thesis (articulated on page 13), that the employment of military unilateralism by the Bush Administration is not the policy of &quot;realism&quot; it's made out to be. With his thorough focus on ongoing and potential military threats and ample documentation of global, especially Middle Eastern, opinions of American actions, Mann proves that we're not winning any friends worldwide. Indeed, burdened as we are with a particularly parochial viewpoint, &quot;Americans, insulated within their self-censorship, do not even know how isolated they are&quot; (p. 261). Worse, many Americans who do recognize this don't seem to care.<br />This is where I think Mann's tone comes into play. His casual deployment of Leftist smear-words (describing the 2000 election, for example, as &quot;a neo-conservative chicken-hawk coup&quot; [p. 252], as just one example), or constant mis-identification of America's mercantilist trade policy as &quot;capitalism&quot; or &quot;free trade,&quot; no doubt endear him to a certain segment of his readership. But it undermines what I think is a far more important mission: helping potentially sympathetic audiences (even conservative ones) see the strengths of his arguments. In this area, Chalmers Johnson's recent &quot;The Sorrows of Empire&quot; is a much better work.<br />The other area where Johnson's book is far stronger than Mann's is in his long-term historical perspective. Mann is too quick to paint the new militarism as a product of a neo-conservative cabal. Unquestionably, the neo-cons play a major role in the growth of the Empire, especially the current emphasis on military unilateralism. But Mann writes as though the &quot;Incoherent Empire&quot; was conceived in Defense Department memoranda during Bush the Elder's term, and midwifed by Bush the Younger following 9/11. In fact, Johnson makes an almost ironclad (in my opinion) case that the roots of Empire sink far back into America's past. The old clich&eacute; about Rome not being built in a day has a literal, and precise, application here.<br />And if Rome wasn't built in a day, it won't be burnt in one either. Mann writes on his last page that the &quot;political solution&quot; to the situation he describes is to &quot;throw the new militarists out of office&quot; in November 2004. But to turn out the neo-cons and replace Bush the Younger with someone different (and the differences between Bush and Kerry are much smaller than either man would have us believe), would simply mean changing the Emperor. The apparatus of imperial power would remain in place.<br />Mann's book is a good start, but I believe he needs to widen his field of vision somewhat.

How useful or entertaining it will be to you depends on what you're looking for.<br />Alice Medrich is undoubtedly one of the pioneers of the chocolate revolution which is elevating Americans' palates away from mass-produced factory chocolates and toward the kind of diversity and quality we began to see with wines a couple of decades ago. &quot;Bittersweet&quot; tells the story of the author's role in that, from her first discovery of chocolate as a child to the chocolate czarina she is today.<br />The heavy admixture of the author's life story means that there's a lot more of the first-person pronoun than is usual in most cookbooks. If what you're looking for is a comprehensive chocolate cookbook, you may find this title a little heavy on extraneous personal information and a little light on photos. As is becoming the trend in chocolate cooking, the recipes here range far beyond desserts, and include entrees (chopped chicken livers with sherry-cocoa pan sauce, for example), soups, salads, and the like. Most of the emphasis, however, is on baking, mousses, souffl&eacute;s, and the rest. A generous &quot;Before You Begin&quot; section includes useful notes on buying, storing, and melting chocolate, tools of the trade, and other relevant information. &quot;Chocolate Notes&quot; accompanying most recipes offer additional tips and variations.<br />Personally, I didn't know that Alice Medrich was, in the dust jacket's breathless description, &quot;synonymous with chocolate.&quot; And so I found the biographic sections somewhat less than compelling. But her expertise is hard to deny, and the recipes themselves are interesting and frequently tantalizing. This may not be the best cookbook for picking up and browsing through. But for chocophiles interested in learning more about one of the celebrities of the gourmet chocolate world, I'm sure there's more than enough here to whet your appetite.	2004-03-03

Lewis: The Gift of Friendship	Books	4	11	13	N	N	Numinousity reflected	I may be the only person in North America never to have read either J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth books or C.S. Lewis' Narnia series (though I have read some of Lewis' theological works). Nevertheless, I find both these men fascinating. The vision of them seated by a fire in an Oxford college in the 1930s, enjoying wide-ranging and casual discussion, is almost iconic. If other readers share this vision, Colin Duriez's &quot;The Gift of Friendship&quot; will be a warmly rewarding read.<br />Duriez is an expert on Tolkien, Lewis, and the Inklings. And although, so far as I could tell, he breaks no new ground in this parallel biography, that's not to sell short the value of what he does give us -- especially for non-specialists.  Duriez takes the image and makes it real. Both men come through as distinct individuals -- personalities, creators, and friends, with similarities, differences, tensions, estrangements, and reconciliations.<br />Part biography, part literary criticism, &quot;The Gift of Friendship&quot; goes a lot more deeply into the lives and work of both men than I expected it to. As an introduction to them, their influence on each other, their amazing productivity, and (to an extent) their influence on the wider world, this very interesting and worthwhile book is proof of the Biblical admonition that &quot;As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.&quot;	2004-03-03

It's at various time enraging, astonishing, and depressing ... and always enlightening. It makes connections and draws together pieces I had never seen as a whole before. It's probably one of the most significant books I've read in several years.<br /><br />Chalmers Johnson is relentless in describing the rise of characteristic aspects of militarism in the United States and showing how the rise of an American Empire is undermining what remains of our Constitutional republic. And while many writers are employing the word \\"empire\\" these days, Johnson builds a solid case, with historical parallels, for the precise application of the term to the situation we face today.<br /><br />Far more than the old Eisenhower definition of \\"the military-industrial complex,\\" the American Empire is a web of military power, industrial and trade dominance, media influence, domestic pork-barrel politics, international arm-twisting, and more. And while the Bush Administration has made the military unilateralism more evident than before, Johnson shows how its roots thread solidly through the Clinton years as well, and back several generations. His chronicle of America's increasing military presence in bases across the globe, and the arrogance with which we built this imperial archipelago, is itself very disturbing.<br /><br />Some may criticize Johnson for his book's gloomy outlook and its substantive lack of a \\"what can we do about it?\\" element. But at the risk of sounding self-righteous, there are still so very many people who need to wake up and see the picture Johnson is painting. So long as Americans remain kirbywildered (to coin a term perhaps understandable by Seattle talk-radio listeners) by avowals of American exceptionalism and military triumphalism, it's enough to do all we can to help Johnson's message, and that of others like him, be heard and understood.<br /><br />Read this book. You may not like it. You may not agree with it. But you need to see how he's put the pieces together and decide how you're going to respond.see how he's put the pieces together and decide how you're going to respond.	2004-02-27

I highly recommend it.<br />Adrian Tinniswood, the author of a biography of Christopher Wren and a history of architecture (among other titles), brings us to the intersection of those two topics, the massive fire that swept through the City of London in early September, 1666. For me, as I'd suspect for many readers, about the only thing I knew about the Great Fire of London was that it allowed Christopher Wren to demonstrate his genius in rebuilding the city's churches. In fact, the story is quite a lot larger than that.<br />Tinniswood's recounting of the fire itself is a narrative worth the price of the book. But what really makes this memorable history is the way the author places the fire in a larger social context of municipal politics, religious bigotry, the fear of war and reprisal, and much more.<br />What I found more fascinating even than the fire, however, was the author's description of the rebuilding of London and what it demonstrates about the English. In other nations and other times, politicians would not have hesitated to use the Fire as an excuse for a massive &quot;visionary&quot; building of a glorious new capital. But in London, any such plans foundered on the rocks of economic and property rights. The government simply refused to trample propertyholders' legitimate claims -- and the landowners and tenants themselves refused to be driven off their land merely to accommodate the social engineers' dreams of a newer, greater London.<br />Similarly, &quot;A nationwide tax [to pay for rebuilding the City] would have been turned down flat by Parliament -- why should the rest of the country be made to suffer for London's losses?&quot; [p. 225]. Parliamentary and City leaders even hamstrung the power of the powerful Companies to limit entry to their trades in order to keep reconstruction costs down ... sort of the seventeenth-century equivalent of Right to Work laws.<br />On the whole, there is a lot going on in this story. But Adrian Tinniswood ties it all together extremely well. Even for readers whose interests may not lie in the history of the Restoration era, this is an interesting tale that's both educational and inspirational. And that's not a bad way to spend your reading time.of Right to Work laws.<br />On the whole, there is a lot going on in this story. But Adrian Tinniswood ties it all together extremely well.

Route 66 has all the glamour -- songs, movies, web sites galore. It's an icon of American car culture. Its sister, U.S. Highway 99, on the other hand, doesn't get no respect. But as this volume shows, 99 is more than just 66 upside-down.<br /><br />This book, the third in the \\"That Ribbon of Highway\\" series, follows Highway 99 from the Oregon-California border north to the Canada line (the first two books take it through California). In some places, 99 is a significant urban thoroughfare. In others, its track is almost forgotten. But along the way, Jill Livingston and Kathryn Golden Maloof reveal the often surprising wealth of history, engineering, culture, and nostalgia that line the route. An appendix knits old 99 together from one end to the other, with directions and local highlights for anyone adventurous enough to make the drive. They make the trip sound worthwhile.<br /><br />Living as I do a half-block from Highway 99 [or, as I did at the time this review was written], it was hard to think of the road as being as interesting as it apparently is. But now I even have a little affection for the old thing. This book is a great one to keep handy in the glove compartment. Who needs to head off down Route 66 when we have our own transportation and cultural milestone right here?	2004-02-05

The essays are almost uniformly well written, entertaining, and sometimes even educational. More than a few are laugh-out-loud funny, some are quite memorable, and one at least is unexpectedly poignant -- a contribution by slain WSJ reporter Daniel Pearl.<br />Animal lovers might well find themselves sitting down and reading this title from end to end. And certainly, people who otherwise have no sympathy with or interest in the Journal will find this worth the read. It would make a fine book to keep by your bed, or in a guest bedroom, for an end-of-the-evening treat before resting up in readiness for what The Street may throw at you in the morning.	2004-02-05

This title is a fun and interesting way to introduce young readers to the institution of the presidency without weighing them down particularly (or at all, really) with details of the actual functions of the office. There are lots of \\"interesting facts\\" -- shortest, tallest, oldest, oddest professions before becoming president, what musical instruments they played, that sort of thing -- that ought to make the cold portraits of our Chief Executives come to a bit more life. At the back of the book is a list of our first 42 presidents, their life dates and dates in office, and a few words about their accomplishments.<br />Individual parents or teachers will probably want to decide whether the children reading this deserve or can handle a more in-depth discussion than \\"presidents want to help people.\\" But this certainly seems like a decent place for young readers to start.<br />The stickler for accuracy in me can't help but point out, however, one \\"fact\\" that isn't actually true. The author writes on page 43 that \\"Almost two hundred years passed before a woman -- Geraldine Ferraro -- ran for Vice President.\\" In fact, the Libertarian Party nominated a woman, Tonie Nathan, for VP in 1972. She went down in history as the first woman to receive a vote in the electoral college, a full 12 years before Ferraro became the first woman nominated for VP by a major party. Even then, I'm sure there were other women who *ran* for VP before 1972. Even for the youngest readers, there's no reason not to use precise language.<br />Apart from that particular quibble, however, I'd recommend this as a good introduction to the personalities and trivia of the presidency for young readers.	2004-01-27

Flynn, particularly his priceless [[ASIN:B001D0MJWS The Roosevelt Myth]]. It's an obvious comparison, but also a very apt one. In \\"FDR's Folly,\\" Jim Powell does for FDR's economics what Flynn did for his politics. Combine these two books with Thomas Fleming's [[ASIN:0465024653 The New Dealers' War: FDR and the War Within World War II]] and you'll have the ultimate \\"revisionist\\" trilogy for deconstructing the most unjustly inflated reputation in American history (and that's without anyone even mentioning the words \\"Pearl Harbor\\"...).<br /><br />Admittedly, Powell's book may not be for everyone. It's about economics and economic policy. Discussions of monetary policy and the Federal Reserve, consumer confidence, antitrust theory, and the like can have a very high MEGO (\\"my eyes glaze over\\") factor for many readers. But I encourage them to motor through the rough parts anyway. Powell notes at one point that many New Dealers acted as if they believed all the economy needed to get back on track in the 1930s was enough bureaucrats in Washington ordering it to do so. Amid the economics are interesting and educational insights on politics, personalities, and -- most importantly -- the high costs of bad policy.<br /><br />Obviously, there is a lot of applicability here. The lessons the 1930s taught so painfully about government intervention in the economy are far from universally understood today. On everything from minimum wage and forced-unionism laws to government restraints on competition and attempts to punish the successful though litigation and taxation, echoes of New Deal nostrums still echo today.<br /><br />But even if you're less interested in modern debates, and are just searching for a worthwhile historical study, this title has much to recommend it. Powell has not, perhaps, blazed new trails in historical research. But he has done a remarkable job of synthesizing economic and political evidence and making a strong case for the high price \\"That Man\\" and his woefully-misnamed \\"brain trust\\" extracted from the American people.

Hold him and his immense life up to the light and turn them around some, and you'll always find interesting new facets to explore. (I have a feeling WSC himself would have appreciated that metaphor.) This explains the constant stream of articles and books on the Man of the (Twentieth) Century -- many re-examining old themes and issues, but a surprising number coming up with new aspects or approaches to understanding who Churchill was and what he did.<br />This title is of the latter sort. Celia Sandys, WSC's granddaughter and author of two earlier books on the man, here presents us with a Churchill biography that focuses on his wide-ranging travels outside the UK. In many cases, Sandys has herself followed in her grandfather's footsteps, revisiting the locales -- and in many cases the actual buildings -- of WSC's visits. Hence the title.<br />Despite Sandys' encyclopedic chronicle, I suspect it is this latter, personal element that many readers may find especially interesting. What Churchillian hasn't thought how much fun it would be to retrace his footsteps along the armored train track in South Africa? Few of us, however, have Sandys' access to places and people (including Fidel Castro), nor I suspect her ability to tell a story.<br />Even more memorable, and touching, are the author's memories of her own participation in some of Churchill's later travels, especially aboard Aristotle Onassis' yacht \\"Christina.\\"<br />In all, there may be some value to the student in having the dates and places of Churchill's major journeys, including his wartime travels, easily accessible within one set of covers. But for most of us, the true value comes in finding yet another facet through which to view the man and his personality, and to read a few more interesting and entertaining memories. I admit I found myself skimming over the travel details from time to time, but the stories made the book more than worth the time.	2004-01-14

And despite their different backgrounds, they had more than a few things in common. A parallel biography of the two men, and parallel analysis of their work, just makes sense. Stephen Citron has pulled it off admirably.<br />The book is arranged chronologically, and chapters alternate between the two men. Their lives frequently intersect and intertwine, but the still-significant differences between the two don't get lost. Citron is not only a skilled biographer. He also has an insightful eye for drama and music. His analysis of selected Porter and Coward songs, occupying the last sixty or so pages of the book, should be a handy reference and guide to the work of both men.	2004-01-14

When I first read it several years ago, I was struck by Hoare's thoroughness, his dispassion, and his wide-ranging research. While this book may not be flawless, it's certainly good enough, I believe, to be the current standard biography of the man.<br />Despite Coward's reputation as the quintessence of high-class sophistication and airy panache, Hoare shows how the man was shaped by his distinctly unglamorous childhood. His days as a hard-working child actor are thoroughly explored, as are his relationships with colleagues, lovers, competitors, and friends. While not prurient, Hoare clearly loves a good story, and doesn't mind dealing dish (as they say) on his subject when he has one to tell.<br />Though not really a devotee of theater generally, I am a fan of Coward's. Having read a few titles about the man, I don't hesitate to say this is the best of the lot. Whether you're a student of the man or a casual acquaintance who wants to know more about one of the outstanding talents of the last century, Philip Hoare's biography is a resource to read, enjoy, and keep close to hand.	2004-01-14

In a world in which the book is ever less appreciated, we love it, and have an instinctual sympathy for others who do too. And so I approached \\"So Many Books, So Little Time\\" expecting that Sara Nelson and I would connect, and that she would take me on a memorable trip.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong. For one thing, she and I hang out in very different parts of the Dewey decimal system. The books she reads -- contemporary fiction, New York Times bestsellers, and dated \\"classics\\" \\"everyone\\" has, or \\"should,\\" read -- leave me cold (Anyone who says she's ashamed never to have read Toni Morrison is someone with whom I have nothing in common). And her observations on those books tended to leave me even colder. By the time she was meditating on the ethics of reviewers not actually finishing reading the books they review, I was seriously considering doing exactly that.<br /><br />Obviously, based on the other reviews on this page, not everyone had the same reaction. But having just finished Gabriel Zaid's thought-provoking [[ASIN:158988003X So Many Books: Reading and Publishing in an Age of Abundance]] -- a volume with a generally similar topic, as well as title -- Nelson's insights and discoveries seemed, to borrow another reviewer's word, facile. I challenge anyone to read Zaid's brief book and not come to the same conclusion.<br /><br />Frankly, I had hoped this book would be something like Kevin Murphy's [[ASIN:0060937866 A Year at the Movies: One Man's Filmgoing Odyssey]], in which the author watches a film, in a theater, every day for a year. Murphy's reflections on movies, the movie industry, and the role of film in society are informed, challenging, and educational. Sara Nelson, on the other hand, seemed to spend most of her reading year being reminded of her mother.<br /><br />\\"So many books, so little time\\" is a frequent lamentation of mine.

Both elegant and wise, &quot;So Many Books&quot; is not simply a defense of the book as a medium. It's also, on a larger scale, a defense of reading, of those who choose (and, as the author notes, really know *how*) to read, and of the place of reading in inter-cultural and inter-generational &quot;conversations.&quot;<br />Gabriel Zaid looks at the economics of the publishing industry, and also the relative merits of books over both older (oral tradition, parchment) and newer (e-books, CD-ROMs) means of storing and exchanging information. He places reader, author, and individual book within a &quot;constellation&quot; of books in which ideas are exchanged. And he weaves &quot;a hairshirt for masochistic authors&quot; by showing how few books are read, preserved, or -- frankly -- even noticed by the reading public.<br />But most of all, Zaid shows that books are nothing less than the cornerstone of the effort to define, preserve, and expand culture. The fact that there are so many books to read shouldn't depress us but, instead, excite us and make those of us committed to reading a bit more secure in what some no doubt consider our eccentricity. This is a title I hope to return to again and again.	2004-01-02

But it was still a worthwhile and entertaining read.<br /><br />On the verge of the publication of his first book, Paul Collins, his wife, and young child leave San Francisco behind to move to the UK, his parents' homeland, and specifically to the book-lovers' Mecca of Hay-on-Wye, a Welsh border village known for its huge number of antiquarian bookstores. I had expected this book to consist of about equal parts meditative reflections on country life; affecting thoughts on the wonders of exploring one bookstore after another, uncovering unanticipated treasures, and what being an author is really all about; and dawning realizations of the real meaning of home and family amid new surroundings.<br /><br />In fact, \\"Sixpence House\\" is not anything so treacly. Collins and his family never really settle in to Hay at all. His encounters with the village's unimaginably vast collection of books are almost always depressing. And the UK as a whole compares poorly with the United States -- at least to my mind, and on such metrics as the quality and quantity of consumer goods, the barriers of regulation and red tape, and other things that people who dream of pulling up stakes and moving somewhere new often forget to take into account.<br /><br />The real \\"meditative reflections\\" and \\"affecting thoughts\\" in this book have a lot more to do with the anonymity to which nearly all authors ultimately descend (those who rise out of it in the first place), and about how perishable man and his works tend to be. They're valuable and thought-provoking insights that may ultimately make the reader treasure her own collection of books all the more, if only for fear of what their fate might be after our own time with them has passed. And for me, the \\"unanticipated treasure\\" here was a page or two Collins spends discussing one of my favorite writers, Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn, an Austrian author whose 1940 novel [[ASIN:B000VACXGS Moscow 1979]] the \\"King of Hay\\" tosses aside as \\"trash ... no one will ever want to read.\\" In fact, Collins does read it (as have I), and spends a few paragraphs describing it and its author.<br /><br />Of course, as Collins also notes, it's almost impossible to find a particular title one is searching for in a place as vast as Hay's bookstores. You just have to encounter the books that are trying to find you.<br /><br />On the whole, I would recommend this title to precisely the people who may turn out to be most disappointed by it: legions of bibliophiles and haunters of antiquarian bookstores. While the story may not turn out to be what you're expecting to encounter, the ideas and memories you'll take away from it will certainly, I think, be worth the effort.es aside as \\"trash ... no one will ever want to read.\\" In fact, Collins does read it (as have I), and spends a few paragraphs describing it and its author.

It becomes even more engrossing, however, as it subtly becomes an autobiography. Ultimately, it's not only about how Seattle wrestled with &quot;the demons of ambition,&quot; it's about Fred Moody's personal battle with them too.<br />For most of his life, Fred Moody's outlook paralleled that of his hometown (as he describes it): low-stress, low-ambition, make enough to get by while leaving time to enjoy the beautiful outdoors, don't cause hassles for other people, be proud about how you're not like people in other parts of the country. Over time, however, as his city gets caught up in an economic boom spurred by the very non-Seattle ambitions of people and corporations like Microsoft, Starbucks, and even Dale Chihuly, Fred finds himself increasingly dissatisfied with his life at the &quot;Seattle Weekly.&quot; He gives in to his demons too, and dives into the dot-com world.<br />Along the way, Moody gives us some fascinating and insightful portraits of people and episodes in Seattle's history -- not just the examples mentioned above, but also Seattle icon Ivar Haglund, Sub Pop Records and the &quot;grunge&quot; movement, and the life and (essential) death of the &quot;Weekly&quot; itself. Perhaps most memorable and moving is his portrayal of Seattle sculptor James Acord, whose magnum opus, &quot;Monstrance for a Grey Horse,&quot; is now permanently installed in Moody's own front yard.<br />These character sketches are a fascinating part of Moody's book. Ultimately most memorable, though, is his portrait of Seattle itself ... its past and its present, what it used to be and what, he argues, it has become today. In the receding tide of the dot-com wave, Moody sees the re-emergence of some of the essential characteristics of what he calls Invisible Seattle. It's a hopeful sign -- if you share the author's essential outlook -- that what really makes Seattle &quot;Seattle&quot; hasn't been entirely lost. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves this city, or who just wants to understand it a little better. It made a big difference to me.asn't been entirely lost.

862032:US	53058008	R36G3HCPBWGBY5	0814797997	905862751	Conservatism in America since 1930: A Reader	Books	5	14	17	N	N	A &quot;big tent&quot; in the best and most positive of ways	This is a book that, in my humble opinion, probably should be on the desk of every self-described &quot;conservative&quot; leader and activist across America. It's that useful.<br />I say &quot;self-described,&quot; because one of the key recurring features in American conservative history has been the drive by one brand of &quot;conservatives&quot; to purge another brand from movement or party for not meeting the first brand's standards of &quot;real&quot; conservatism. Not surprisingly, therefore, some folks of one or another stripe might argue with the inclusion of the Buchananites, or the Rothbardians, or the Southern Agrarians, or the neo-cons in a book about &quot;conservatives.&quot;<br />As much as it is a documentary history of modern conservatism, though, this book is a useful reminder of how much the various shoots and branches of conservatism still have in common today. Anyone who has read, for example, Dinesh D'Souza's denunciation of libertarians in &quot;Letters to a Young Conservative&quot; would do well to read Rothbard's pre-emptive (1980) refutation of D'Souza's arguments in &quot;What is Libertarianism?&quot; (pp. 262-273). Similarly, the frequent willingness of some to credit William F. Buckley with &quot;inventing&quot; conservatism in the 1950s should note editor Schneider's deliberate dating of the contents of this volume back to 1930. While the vital contributions of Buckley and the Sharon Conference are not slighted, the roots of modern conservatism in the pre-war Old Right are here given the credit they deserve.<br />There are many other important contributions here that deserve to be read and understood by conscientious conservatives. F.A. Hayek's 1959 work &quot;Why I am not a Conservative&quot; (pp. 180-194), as one example, is perhaps better known by its title than by the contents of Hayek's actual argument. For while he shows that he is not, in fact, *a* &quot;conservative,&quot; he also reveals his devotion to ideals very much in line with tradition and a conservative approach to philosophy and life.<br />Through it all, insightful essays and introductions by Schneider himself tie the individual readings together thematically, and also present the various themes and movements within the larger context of the history of American conservatism.<br />On the whole, this volume probably won't resolve the principled differences between, say, Bill Kristol and Sam Francis. But it will help reveal how both men's philosophical stands arise from the same general pool of conservative history. It may not, and perhaps should not, reverse the &quot;conservative crack-up&quot; that has developed in the last years and decades and restore a unified &quot;conservative movement.&quot; But it may  at least provide a much-needed philosophical and historical context for anyone who uses that much-abused label to describe themselves. And given how few modern conservatives seem to know -- or care -- about their own history, that can only be a good thing.e with tradition and a conservative approach to philosophy and life.<br />Through it all, insightful essays and introductions by Schneider himself tie the individual readings together thematically, and also present the various themes and movements within the larger context of the history of American conservatism.<br />On the whole, this volume probably won't resolve the principled differences between, say, Bill Kristol and Sam Francis.

Whether you're living in a masterfully maintained bungalow, are interested in restoring a bungalow to its former glory, or just a fan of good architectural or furniture design, Paul Duchscherer and Douglas Keister's &quot;Bungalow Basics&quot; series has a lot to offer.<br />This volume focuses on the living room, in many ways the defining and unifying element of bungalow design. A nine-page introduction discusses common design themes of bungalow living rooms, from central construction elements like placement of walls, doors, and fireplaces, to furnishing and decoration. Then follows about 50 colorful photos and illustrations, demonstrating these principles and approaches in action.<br />As you would imagine in a book this small, there's not a lot of depth to the discussion. Nor does any individual example receive more than one or two photos. And finally, there's no list of sources where an interested reader could find any of the items or materials pictured herself. So this is not, by any stretch, a do-it-yourself handbook. As the series name suggests, however, this is a focus on the basics. And someone who reads this will have a better idea of the theory of bungalow design, and more than a few great examples of the theory in practice. For the handy little resource this is intended to be, this title carries out its mission quite well.	2003-12-17

On the whole, this is a book that's as much about the author as it is the subject.<br /><br />Many of the reviews on this page describe this book as a good shorter biography of Churchill, but for people looking for a brief introductory volume, I would much sooner point them to one of the excellent short bios that came out in 2002, Lukacs' [[ASIN:0300103026 Churchill: Visionary. Statesman. Historian.]] or Keegan's [[ASIN:B0002X7VAC Winston Churchill: A Penguin Life (Penguin Lives)]]. Both of them are \\"conventional\\" narrative biographies, but each does a fine job laying out the motivations, facts, and consequences of Churchill's massive life. I think it's better to master the themes before exploring the variations, as Rubin does. And while not everyone wants to read thick tomes like Jenkins or Rose or Manchester (or still yet the official biography by Randolph Churchill and Martin Gilbert), I'm afraid anyone who relies on \\"Forty Ways...\\" as their sole source of information on, and interpretation of, the life of the Man of the (Twentieth) Century will be selling herself short.<br /><br />Where this book does shine is in its ability to summarize, highlight important trends and impressions, and compare-and-contrast conflicting interpretations of the man under the microscope. Her central point -- that biographers sift facts in order to prove the point they're trying to make -- is incontrovertible, if perhaps a bit broad-brush. Rubin's perspective, mentioned several times, as the first Churchill biographer (or one of them? I'm not sure) whose life did not overlap his is an interesting one, but perhaps less significant than she credits it to be. And I say that as someone who myself missed overlapping Churchill's life by some 30 months.<br /><br />On the whole, this is an interesting intellectual exercise, with some new insights and interpretations and a few noteworthy points. But I have to disagree with those who call it a wonderful biography. It's not -- at least, not in any conventional sense. But if you already have some familiarity with the building blocks Gretchen Rubin is rearranging, you may find it worthwhile to join in her experimentation yourself.interesting one, but perhaps less significant than she credits it to be.

Nearly all general histories of the Pearl Harbor attack either end with the close of the attack, or move into the (necessarily more important) aspect of America starting to respond to the changed world situation and coming to grips with the onset of war. Epilogues sometimes report that most of the damaged ships actually returned to the battle lines, but in-depth reports of what happened at Pearl Harbor itself following the attack are pretty rare.<br />Daniel Madsen steps into this void with a book that, to use another clich&eacute;, reads like a novel. Where he could easily have gotten bogged down in damage reports or engineering minutia, he instead tells a surprisingly interesting story that turns as much on personalities as on mechanics. Amid the uncertainty of never knowing for sure whether the Japanese would return for a second strike at the fleet, civilian and naval engineers, divers, repair workers, and line officers devised innovative solutions to large and sometimes unprecedented problems. I can't speak too highly of how Madsen succeeds in weaving this into an interesting and well-paced narrative.<br />Readers familiar with the Pearl Harbor story will appreciate finding out what happened to the ships, and the base as a whole, in the weeks and months following the attack. Although the eyes of the world moved away from Pearl and onto the wider theater of war after the first days of December, 1941, the story of what happened there is still one well worth telling. I commend Daniel Madsen for the fine job he did telling it, and recommend his work to students of the attack and naval history buffs generally.	2003-12-07

The trick, of course, it to do it in a way that suggests timeless artistry, and not that water will come squirting out of it, or that the wearer is a refugee from the junior prom. There's a big difference between a stylish mini carnation tucked into your buttonhole and a giant mass of babies-breath and rose held on with a safety pin.<br />This handy little guide is all most men should need to navigate the largely unknown waters of boutonniere-wearing. Much of the book, necessarily, traces flower-wearing through history, with a focus on the British royal family and various dandies of times past. A few profiles of modern men who keep the tradition alive are also included, as well as helpful suggestions about various types of flowers to wear, what to wear with what kind of jacket, and even alternatives to the jacket lapel like vests and overcoats.<br />Take a stand for personal style and start wearing a flower from time to time. If you're unsure about how or whether, let this book help you get started. Once you do, you may never look back.	2003-12-07

And they have remained legion among later generations. But in the wake of the September 11 attacks, many people -- and especially many politicians in need of stirring rhetoric -- have turned to WSC again, attracted to his reputation, perhaps, more than to the strict details of his long and eventful life.<br />John Ramsden's fascinating book is an analysis of how Churchill's reputation was born, was consciously shaped by the man himself, and how it has evolved in the years since his death. The bulk of the analysis focuses on the five English-Speaking nations, though Europe is included as well. Another large section looks at the famous &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; or &quot;Sinews of Peace&quot; speech at Fulton, Missouri, in 1946, and how it -- precisely as WSC intended -- transformed the world's view of him from heroic-but-pass&eacute; war leader to very-much-active statesman, politician, and geopolitical strategist.<br />A final section, which I found the most interesting, analyses many of the key Churchill biographies written over the years, from Randolph Churchill and Martin Gilbert's official biography, to Lord Moran, to Manchester, to Roy Jenkins' &quot;Churchill: A Biography&quot; (2001), which Ramsden predicts will remain &quot;the authoritative single text for years to come&quot; (p. 545). Ramsden also seems to have counted every Churchill memorial statue, street, pub, and park bench in the world. And while a catalog of these things could easily become tiresome, this author skillfully keeps it from doing so.<br />This is no small accomplishment. People who write about Churchill are forced to deal with the sheer immensity of his life. Many respond by being prolix, or trite, or they oversimplify, or caricaturize, or fall into either blind hero-worship or equally unnuanced destructiveness. Ramsden does none of these. One way he manages this, of course, is by being fairly sparing of the details of most of WSC's life. Thus, this book will make a lot more sense to someone who already has a fairly good understanding of who the man was, what he did, and when. Another way is by filling his text with stories about, and insights into, Churchill and his contemporaries that are nearly all some combination of fascinating, entertaining, and memorable. Thus, while he's dealing with some Grand Themes, the author surrounds them with a bodyguard of anecdotes that in and of themselves almost guarantee this will be a fun read for any Churchill student or fan.<br />Significantly, Ramsden is not an *uncritical* admirer of Churchill, though he is clearly an admirer. The Winston we encounter here is not sugarcoated, and some of his unattractive features do come through. That and the mountainous research on display are two signs of Ramsden's chops as a historian.<br />Finally, as a many-year member of The Churchill Centre and its preceding organization the International Churchill Societies, I should note and commend Ramsden's coverage of this worthy organization. Far from the worshipful society of star-struck fans it is sometimes painted to be, Ramsden shows the CC to be a reputable and respectable association of clear-eyed admirers of the man of the century, warts and all.<br />I am always amazed at the new aspects or corners of Churchill's life and impact that people can find to write books about.

Kingston Pierce's subtitle suggests -- and his interesting and entertaining history reveals -- that vision of Seattle's past, if it was ever accurate, was at best only an interlude between the Emerald City's rowdy origins and the fast-paced *urbs* we are today.<br />For much of its early history, Seattle was a quintessential frontier town. And from that standpoint, many of the people to whom the author introduces us didn't really strike me as that &quot;eccentric&quot; at all. On the contrary, they seemed like the fairly standard character types one found in many American frontier settlements: the brothel keepers, the moralists, the criminals on the lam, the get-rich-quick artists, the Horatio Algers determined to make a fortune through hard work, the people who failed Back East and came west to start over, and, inevitably, the politicians.<br />Though these characters are familiar, Pierce does a fine job weaving them into the interesting tapestry that is Seattle history, and showing how they continued to affect the city even after its frontier days were long dead.<br />I for one can hardly wander through a city without wondering what kind of history took place there, what it looked like 100 years ago, and how it became what it is. The &quot;sense of place&quot; is very important to me. I understand Seattle a lot better for having read this book. Pierce has given faces and stories to many of the names that stare back at us from building fronts and street signs, uncovered important landmarks (literal and figurative) in the city's history, and generally done a good job proving the argument his subtitle asserts.<br />If, as Winston Churchill suggested, how clearly you see the past shapes how clearly you'll see the future, anyone interested in the future of Seattle (or, less pretentiously, anyone simply interested in some entertaining true stories about places that may already be familiar to you) should definitely get to know this book.attle (or, less pretentiously, anyone simply interested in some entertaining true stories about places that may already be familiar to you) should definitely get to know this book.	2003-11-21

But, as the narrator observes, &quot;he finds a five-year-old can't get close enough to see anything.&quot; To which Tom Servo cheerfully adds, &quot;Besides, the Mariners are playing, so who cares?&quot; That episode aired in the early '90s. How the Ms got from being the laughingstock of MLB to very near the top in just a few years, and got a new stadium in the bargain, is the focus of Art Thiel's very good book.<br />From its founding in 1977, the result of a legal settlement, until the mid-1990s, the Mariners were, as Thiel reminds us, a really, really bad team. Even with the glory years of the late '90s, the Ms still hold the mark for lowest total fan attendance in both the 1980s and the 1990s. Along the way, however, a change of ownership, a fiery new manager, and several key player acquisitions turned the Ms into a powerhouse.<br />The author does a fine job of taking us through those steps. As a result, this is much more than just a summary of several baseball seasons (though he does take us through the 1995 and 2001 seasons, in particular, in some detail). He also takes us behind the scenes, into the business side of the game where the key decisions are made, and also gets into some serious local politics surrounding the funding and construction of Safeco Field. Central episodes in this book include the arrival of the new ownership team, the hiring (and later release) of Lou Piniella, the drafting (and, again, subsequent loss) of Ken Griffey, Jr., and Alex Rodriguez, the Randy Johnson trade, and the arrival of Ichiro Suzuki. Personally, I found this last to be the most interesting part of the book, but maybe that's because I find Ichiro the most interesting player in baseball.<br />Throughout it all, the author's exclusive interviews with Jay Buhner and Lou himself provide spirited and insightful insider quotes. I should also commend the author's ability to make criticisms where they're required, calling out both poor baseball strategy and bad business decisions.<br />The casual Seattle baseball-watcher looking to relive some great seasons will find a lot here to enjoy. But the more serious fan, who really wants to go behind the scenes and see how the Ms became who and what they are today, will definitely want to add this to his shelf.th Jay Buhner and Lou himself provide spirited and insightful insider quotes.

I've recently read a number of books that attempted to capture the special appeal of the French caf&eacute;, and merge culture study, attractive photography, and enticing recipes into one volume. None of those attempts succeeded nearly as well as Rick Rodgers has done with his look at the classic Kaffeeh&auml;user of Vienna, Budapest, and Prague.<br />An experienced, and expert, cooking teacher and cookbook author, Rick Rodgers also has ancestral connections to bakeries in the old Austro-Hungarian Empire. He gives us a fascinating look at the coffee houses and their place in Central European culture, and explains how the recipes he's selected fir into the cultural and historical context (Rodgers explains that this cultural context is something the Austrians, in particular, especially value). The recipes themselves are enticing and interesting, with a nice combination of the familiar and the more exotic. Beautiful photography -- both of food and of caf&eacute;s -- and insightful mini-essays on a variety of topics enhance the very attractive *m&eacute;lange,* which is rounded out by the author's personal guide to Central European coffeehouses, a glossary of Viennese, Czech, and Hungarian coffee terms, and a useful list of resources and links. There's even a full bibliography of historical and culinary sources.<br />I've always been eager to visit Vienna and the other cities of the Empire. Until I get there, this book will keep my culinary, as well as my historical, interests fired up.	2003-11-20

It won't be easy to carry it to the beach, but the Python fan will definitely find enough within these hard covers to keep her entertained and informed for a good long time.<br />The book consists almost entirely of excerpts from interviews with the Pythons. In that sense, it is indeed an autobiography. The Pythons go in depth about their pre-show lives, what it was like doing the program, and the process of making the movies, live shows, and other Pythonalia. It's not a *funny* book in the sense of being full of deliberate jokes. But they people themselves are all entertaining, and the references and many, many photos -- including personal snaps and show outtakes -- will certainly trigger countless happy memories.<br />As I say, the interviews go very in depth about a lot of things, and so it can get just a little tedious at times, with details about movie shoots, legal arrangements, and the rest. At the same time, they don't seem to be holding anything back, and the force and nature of each man's personality really comes through. It's interesting not only to see how mix, and clash, of characters shaped the Python product, but also to see personal tensions wax and wane over the years.<br />If there is a drawback to this book, apart from the occasional tedium and the sheer weight of the thing, it's some of the chapter headings, captions, and other material not written by the Pythons themselves. People who write about Monty Python seem afflicted by a need to try to be as funny as the Pythons themselves, and it seldom works. And so we get chapter headings like &quot;In Which the Pythons Meet the Pythons&quot; or &quot;In Which We All Become Starlets&quot; -- it just gets a little tiresome.<br />Apart from that, though, it's hard to imagine any Python fan not coveting this book, and carefully preserving it next to his copy of  &quot;Thirty Days in the Samarkand Desert with the Duchess of Kent&quot; by AEJ Eliott, OBE. It's definitely worth the price to purchase (and the effort to carry around), and is sure to be treasured.t's definitely worth the price to purchase (and the effort to carry around), and is sure to be treasured.	2003-11-14
904995:US	53058008	R3PE9W7PHR5RMC	1569245134	747987059	Party of One: The Loners' Manifesto	Books	5	408	417	N	N	The menace of the herd	As a dyed-in-the-wool (and unrepentant) introvert, I wished, at first, that Anneli Rufus hadn't chosen the word &#34;loner&#34; for her title, linked as it is with inevitable prefix &#34;crazed&#34; in so many news stories of murderers on the loose. But that's exactly her point: Rufus is determined to rescue the word -- and more importantly, the reputation of the people the word accurately describes -- from the misinterpretations and calumnies heaped upon it, and us, for so long.<br /><br />It's an uphill fight, but it's definitely worth the effort. This book isn't one of the many attempts to offer introverts &#34;coping skills&#34; or networking tips for surviving with our sanity in an extroverted world. Instead, it's more of a call to extroverts out there to understand whom you're dealing with ... or more correctly, whom they're not dealing with ... and what we're all about.<br /><br />To do this, Rufus covers a wide range of history and popular culture, showing how introverts have carved out places for themselves and learned to live with at least some degree of peace, despite the constant tug of &#34;caring&#34; people crying, &#34;Come out of your shell and live a little!&#34; It may seem paradoxical for a loner to tell other loners &#34;We're not alone,&#34; but in this instance, it's a surprisingly comforting message.<br /><br />Rufus's chapter on crime may be the most important, and the one with the widest implications outside the introvert community (so to speak), because it's here that she tackles the myth of the murderous loner and attempts to salvage the word from those who, she argues, misuse it so terribly.<br /><br />Loners, she says, are people who *want* to be alone. Who enjoy their solitude. But many of the criminals who have been tagged as &#34;loners&#34; don't fit that description at all. Many of them have been marginalized from society, and want to strike back at it. They want to impress others, and be accepted by those whose approval they crave. Or, like Mark David Chapman, the &#34;pseudoloner&#34; who killed John Lennon, they simply crave attention. There's no such thing as an &#34;attention-seeking loner.&#34;<br /><br />There are other criminals, she argues, for whom the &#34;loner&#34; label doesn't even remotely fit, and she roundly criticizes the police profilers and news reporters who use the term so sloppily. Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, for example, wasn't a loner at all, though he's often described that way. Neither were the Columbine High School shooters, or Ted Bundy, or John Wayne Gacy, though all of them have been called &#34;loners.&#34;<br /><br />Her point is an important one, if one many may dismiss as mere semantics. And it ties into her other important chapter, on raising loner children. If parents believe -- as many apparently do -- that any child who prefers to play by himself is liable to grow up to become a mass murderer, and therefore needs to be &#34;cured,&#34; or &#34;trained&#34; out, of his introvert personality, life for that child is simply going to be hell. Though my situation growing up was hardly as extreme as some of the stories told here, I nevertheless sympathized completely with children made to act more extroverted than was comfortable for them. Loner children recognize they're different, Rufus writes, but don't know why, or what about them needs defending. If their parents are convinced there's something &#34;wrong&#34; with the introverted child, and try to &#34;fix&#34; it, they will create wounds that may never close.<br /><br />This book struck close to home for me, and I really enjoyed it. I'm comfortable enough in my introversion ... my &#34;lonerism&#34; ... not to need a defense for it. But I'm glad this book exists -- not just for my loner brothers and sisters, but for the great mass of extroverts who can't understand why we're so &#34;shy,&#34; and why we seem to enjoy -- how sick! -- our time alone. In a world which seems convinced, as theauthor puts it, that the only things worth doing are things done with other people, her proud declaration that we're perfectly well adjusted, &#34;just not to their frequency,&#34; is a deeply welcome one.<br /><br />Loners of the World, don't unite! There's nothing wrong with wanting to be alone!other people, her proud declaration that we're perfectly well adjusted, &#34;just not to their frequency,&#34; is a deeply welcome one.

On the one hand, he wants to give us a representative sampling of caf&eacute; cuisine, so we can recreate at home the tastes and smells of the Paris caf&eacute; experience. And here, I think, he succeeds admirably.<br /><br />At the same time, however, he is also attempting to present us with something of a portrait of caf&eacute; culture -- a celebration, in the words of the introduction, \\"of what makes this institution so worth preserving.\\" No less, the author hopes that after reading his book, we \\"should be prepared to choose a regular Parisian caf&eacute; to call your own.\\" Frankly, I don't think he achieves this second goal nearly so well.<br /><br />This book is divided, in standard cookbook fashion, by categories of food -- appetizers, entrees, and so on. Caf&eacute;s are presented within each section based on the representative recipe Young has chosen from its menu. If more than one selection comes from a given caf&eacute;, however, they appear on different pages, sometimes widely separated. While the virtue of this approach is unmistakable for a cookbook, it does make it a bit more difficult to consider any given caf&eacute;.<br /><br />While the writing about each caf&eacute; is generally pretty good, I didn't find the text-heavy layout and two-color photography particularly inviting. And for a book that's supposed to help us choose a caf&eacute; or two of our own, I was very disappointed that there were so few photos ... and that the ones that there were, were so often less than evocative. If Daniel Young's descriptive writing could be combined with the wonderful photography of Marie-France Boyer's [[ASIN:0500016224 The French Cafe]], *that* would be a book to treasure.<br /><br />In all, your opinion of this book will be colored by what you hope to get out of it. If, like some of the other reviewers on this page, you want to cook authentic and memorable caf&eacute; offerings in your own home, then this is probably just what you're looking for.

As Frederic Morton makes clear, many of the strains that wove together to create the modern world -- in science, medicine, politics, and art -- have their roots in this time and place. In choosing just a few months in the period 1888-1889, Morton isolates a time when the cracks in the Habsburg edifice are beginning to show. It's a fascinating portrait that, in the clich&eacute;d reviewer's phrase, reads like a novel.<br />Morton's narrative does require the reader to have a bit of context about Austrian, and broader European, history. But even for the reader without this grounding, there's much here to appreciate. While he does seem to take author's liberties sometimes -- how can we really know all Crown Prince Rudolf was thinking in his final days? -- the image he paints of a crumbling society held together by gilt and glitter is remarkable. So too are the individual portraits: Rudolf, his father the Emperor, Freud, Klimt, Mahler, Brahms, and many more. There were many strains of genius at work in Vienna in 1889, building a new world under the looming threat of the old world's collapse, and Frederic Morton captures them.<br />The late Austrian author Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn once noted that World Wars I and II could properly be termed the second War of Austrian Succession, and that the most important long-term consequence of the First World War was the destruction of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Churchill, too, argued that it was the collapse of the Central European thrones that allowed the &quot;Hitlerite monster&quot; -- an Austrian monster Morton foreshadows in this book -- to crawl to power in the 1930s. In more ways than most of us appreciate, we still live in a world with deep roots in Old Vienna. Frederic Morton's interesting and insightful portrait of a key moment in that city's history illuminates both that era and ours in a fascinating new way. It's a book that will reward more than one reading.more than one reading.	2003-10-28

I haven't had a whole lot of exposure to rugby, don't understand all the rules, and sometimes have trouble following the action.

But so much of the action happens very quickly, or inside a scrum of flailing arms and churning legs.<br />That's whaat makes this book such a revelation. Much of the photography is exceptionally high-quality, freezing the action at a moment that reveals all the skill, energy, and passion at work from schoolyard competition to the highest reaches of the World Cup. There are also great shots of players at rest before and after matches, fans with painted faces and raw emotions, and quite a lot more.<br />There's not a lot here about the history of the game, or really much of anything explaining it all to a newbie like me. But whether you're a serious fan who lives or dies with your team, or just someone like me who enjoys a good show, you could do far worse than spending some time poring over the great photos collected here.	2003-10-27

His &quot;Ideological Origins of the American Revolution&quot; is immensely valuable, but I have also enjoyed his smaller collections of essays, including &quot;Faces of the Revolution&quot; and this new title, &quot;To Begin the World Anew.&quot;<br />In this book, Bailyn offers meditations on a number of different Revolution-related subjects, including very interesting pieces on Benjamin Franklin's manipulation of his own image in pre-Revolutionary France, the challenges Jefferson faced in applying pure political theory to the give-and-take of daily politics, and the impact of the American Revolution on Europe and Latin America (it's greater, Bailyn argues, than many people believe it to have been).<br />Most interesting to me, and perhaps most immediately applicable to modern politics -- if that's something you're looking for -- is his chapter on &quot;The Federalist Papers.&quot; Bailyn notes that &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; have acquired a level of sanctity approaching even that of the Constitution itself. They are often cited in Supreme Court decisions, and are seen by many as perhaps the definitive explication of what the Founders truly intended the Constitution to mean and achieve. And yet, as Bailyn points out, &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; were newspaper columns, written in haste and for polemical purposes by a group of men who themselves didn't agree on a number of important matters. Bailyn's narrative of how these writings were elevated from political journalism to secular Scripture is very interesting. The implications of the ways today's government has veered far from the intention of the Founders should set us all to thinking, as should the author's clear rejection of the modern (and Lincolnian) argument that the nation preceded the states and not vice-versa (p. 114).<br />Bailyn also has a number of larger themes that are touched on, to a greater or lesser degree, in each of these essays. One is the influence on the Founding generation of occupying the political, social, and geographic periphery of the Western world, and how that both fueled and emphasized the divisions between colony and metropolis.  In a day when the Founders are often attacked and derided -- or worse -- for the ways in which they failed to anticipate twenty-first century political and social sensibilities, Bailyn again urges us (as he has elsewhere) to recognize the Founders' energy and imagination. We should be willing to give them credit for being able to step as far outside the orthodoxies of their time as they in fact did.<br />As ever, Bernard Bailyn's writing is both thought-provoking and entertaining.

From Paris haunts much like the stereotype, to rustic village cafes far outside the metropolis, to the retreats of artists or tradesmen, author and photographer demonstrate that the caf&eacute; is more than a place, but rather an intimate expression of the French lifestyle.<br />The beautiful photos are by far the most engrossing part of this book. But the writing is valuable too, describing the golden age of French cafes, the rise of important establishments like Momus, Les Deux Garçons in Aix-en-Provence, or the Marly, and the influence of the cafes on French art and culture. And though the book's almost a decade old now, the Guide at the end should still be useful in tracking down many of the cafes featured in photo and text.<br />In all, whether you're an experienced boulevardier, a traveler with fond memories, or just someone looking to experience French culture vicariously, &quot;The French Caf&eacute;&quot; should inspire many happy thoughts.	2003-10-15

This book was first published during the 1936 election campaign, and was later revised and reissued in 1937.

If only that had been the case...<br />Lindley, author (at the time this was published, anyway) of two previous books on FDR and his administration, here gives us a look at what the President accomplished in his first term and what challenges he faces in his second. The author is generally sympathetic to FDR and his goals, hostile to That Man's Republican-conservative opponents, and optimistic about the future. At the same time, he's not completely blinkered, and is fairly straightforward about FDR's mistakes, and those of his administration, in the first term.<br />This title doesn't offer a whole lot to the modern reader, except perhaps as a survey of contemporary opinion. From that standpoint it may be moderately useful, but even then no longer brings to the table much that's unique or especially noteworthy.	2003-10-13

He arrives in Hawaii in late 1941, less than a month before the Pearl Harbor attack, and has barely settled in and made friends before the Japanese attack erupts on December 7.<br />Author Harry Mazer has done a good job, not just with the general action of the story, but also in creating a realistic portrayal of a Navy home, with a father intent on maintaining a \\"ship-shape\\" family and running his home like an extension of his ship. This creates more than a little tension in Adam's life, and Mazer describes this well too. Some of the action sequences surrounding the attack seemed a little contrived to me -- could all of that really have happened to one kid? -- but they definitely strike me as a potentially exciting read for this book's target audience. The ambiguity with which the book ends surprised me, but it would certainly make a good jumping-off point for discussions with parents or teachers.	2003-10-13

It becomes more appropriate when you realize that Gerald Kinro's book is (much) less a touristy guide to Hawaiian coffee plantations than it is a work of social history and (perhaps inevitably) a look at a dying way of life.<br />Author Kinro was born and raised on a Kona coffee farm, and this book has the personal feel you'd expect from an author with those experiences. His is a story of people and families ... of the causes and consequences of individual decisions ... and how they and their culture were shaped by, and themselves helped shape, the local and even international economy. People with an interest in coffee, commodity economics, or Hawai`i generally might find this worth a read. But its main audience, I think, will be readers drawn to the social and cultural history of Hawaiian communities, the mixture of Japanese, Hawaiian, and European-American influences, and the way those communities and influences have blended (good coffee term!) over time.	2003-10-13

As the days start to get autumnal, there are few things better than settling in with a college football game on TV and this book on your lap.<br />Richard Whittingham takes us through the history of college football, from the Ivy League dynasties of the 1880s to the 1920s, through Army's dominant years in the 1940s, to today's powerhouse teams and superstar coaches. Along the way, we meet many of the great players and coaches, look at many historic photographs, and read engrossing descriptions of memorable games. The photos are well-chosen and impressive, the writing fast-paced, and the book's layout appealing and easy to read.<br />For any serious and knowledgeable fan, this book can be fodder for countless hot-stove league debates (I know &quot;hot stove league&quot; is a baseball expression, but work with me here). Whittingham makes a case for his choices for best team in each of the decades from the 1900s to the 1990s. He also picks &quot;games worth remembering&quot; from each of the great bowl games, analyses many of the game's great rivalries, and even lists the best (or, to be fair, his favorite) school fight songs and mascots.<br />This is a fascinating, entertaining, and memorable book -- and as a lifelong Roger Staubach fan, I found his foreword an extra bonus. I find it hard to believe that any college football fan wouldn't appreciate receiving it ... and could easily see some of the more serious fans becoming quite passionate about it. It's definitely worth checking out.	2003-10-10

Chantal Coady is a crusader, and her cause is summed up in the name of the organization she formed, the Campaign for Real Chocolate. Not for her is the mass-market, fast food-style chocolate consumed (and enjoyed) by so many British and Americans. She is passionate about *real* chocolate, as defined above.<br />It's certainly true that anyone who has tasted real, high-quality chocolate finds it hard to get excited about the mass-produced vegetable-fat chocolates in the supermarket checkout lines. What you will get excited about, though, are the recipes and ideas in this book. The author takes us far, far beyond cookies and cakes, presenting intriguing ideas for incorporating chocolate into appetizers, entrees (including meat and pasta dishes), martinis, even sushi and tempura ... plus, of course, cookies and cakes.<br />There are a *lot* of books about chocolate out there, and it's hard for one really to stand out from another. If this one does stand out, it's due as much to the author's campaigning fire as it is to her obvious passion for preparing great chocolate dishes. I admire people who take their work seriously and are very good at what they do, and Chantal Coady hits the mark on both scores.	2003-10-10

Books	5	2	2	N	N	Mike Nelson's greatest hit	I'll admit up front I'm an unabashed partisan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and so I'm inclined to want to like anything produced by one of its alumni. And while I thought Mike Nelson's two previous books, collections of short essays, were pretty funny -- and I rated them highly -- there was something about them that didn't feel quite right. I think it must have been the format. Humor essays and short fictions always seem a little forced and artificial to me, and there was some of that in Mike's essays too.<br />But with this novel, his first, I think Mike has found his natural genre. This is a very funny novel, but also a very well written one. The plot has a certain level of absurdity, but not too much: the characters are believable and the situation outlandish, but not so much as to challenge our suspension of disbelief.<br />And it's also, as I say, quite funny. The story picks up steam at it rolls ahead and the situation slips beyond our hero, Pontius Feeb's, ability to control it. The people he encounters along the way include a fascinating bunch of characters, including many stolid Midwesterners, a few Danes somewhat out of their element, and some vaguely recognizable individuals like an action-hero Minnesota governor and a funkalicious singer with a large entourage and &quot;royal&quot; name. One of the elements of this story I liked best was that it, not unlike MST3K, never lost its essentially positive and optimistic worldview. No matter how far into the depths Ponty fell (literally, in the climactic scene), the humor and feeling of cheerfulness remained.<br />I've praised Mike's characterizations, but I should note, too, his skill at descriptive narrative. Many of the funniest passages aren't dialogue, but rather Mike's scene-setting.<br />I liked Mike's essays fine, but I'm not in a hurry to re-read them. But I am eager, now, to read Mike's next novel (making him only the second novelist about whom I'll say that). If I have one suggestion for next time, it would be that Mike or his publisher ditch the &quot;Mike Nelson's...&quot; prefix all his titles so far have included. Now that he's established a reputation as a novelist to watch -- and I think this title does that -- having his name on the cover twice seems like an unnecessary conceit.<br />Well done, Mike.me, it would be that Mike or his publisher ditch the &quot;Mike Nelson's...&quot; prefix all his titles so far have included.

Unfortunately (for me), he then adds, \\"The literature on it is formidable,\\" and immediately qualifies this in a footnote by adding that nearly all of that formidable literature is, not surprisingly, in German. As a result, this book is both rewarding and somewhat unsatisfying: rewarding because it is a revealing look inside the coffeehouse mystique; unsatisfying to me as a historian because its focus ultimately is on the literary work these \\"coffeehouse wits\\" produced, and not so much on the coffeehouse culture as such.<br /><br />At the same time, though, much of the nature of that culture comes through in the excellent selections Segel has assembled here. These writers' focus is often parochial ... even inbred ... revolving around the milieu itself and looking inward at the personalities, concerns, cliques, and spats of the Viennese literary circle. But at the same time, the wider world frequently peeks its head inside this circle, often in the form of allegory or subtle shading.<br /><br />While some of the \\"Vienna coffeehouse wits\\" are enjoying a resurgence in popular recognition, nearly all are -- I would imagine -- unknown to the general American reader (even the fact that [[ASIN:B000UEGBCC Bambi A Life in the Woods]] existed as a novel -- and a novel by an Austrian -- before it became a Disney movie comes a surprise to many, though as this book notes, Felix Salten was a quite well known writer in his day). I don't think that casual reader would necessarily get a lot out of this book. The personalities and catty observations are just too obscure now. But for the specialist, the student of German-language literature, or even someone like me with an interest in Habsburg Austria, this title could potentially be very rewarding. That's why I've given it the four stars I have.<br /><br />Given my original interest, Segel's introduction, \\"The Vienna Coffeehouse in Society and Culture,\\" came closest to being the sort of historical r&eacute;sum&eacute; I was looking for.  But the rest of the book had its entertaining and educational moments as well. It may not be for everyone, but if you have an interest in the place, the era, or its personalities, this book may well repay your interest.interest, Segel's introduction, \\"The Vienna Coffeehouse in Society and Culture,\\" came closest to being the sort of historical résumé I was looking for.

Stratton undermines his argument a little bit -- or perhaps just reinforces the paradoxical nature of the \\"blood feud\\" between the University of Texas and Texas A&M -- by noting that these days, the hick-versus-city slicker stereotypes no longer really apply. Both schools recruit the same kinds of high school students, graduates of both are, in turn, headhunted by the same companies, and relatively few Aggies even have any contact with \\"agriculture\\" any more.<br /><br />But despite that demographic fact, the truth remains that U.T. versus A&M is a Big Thing in the Lone Star State. As a Texan with family connections to both schools (I attended a neutral university in San Antonio myself) as well as to Stratton's native Oklahoma, I really enjoyed his exploration of this feud that transcends mere football and has become a true Texas culture war.<br /><br />I came away from this title with a sense that Stratton focused more on the distinctives on Texas A&M and its unique culture than he did on the U of Texas. Aggies would have an obvious explanation for this, and maybe it's just a false impression on my part, but his descriptions of A&M -- often funny, frequently insightful, and occasionally moving -- were very memorable. And while the author injects himself into the story fairly regularly, it's not a distraction.<br /><br />On the whole, this book would be a fun read, I'd imagine, for any fan of college football and its classic rivalries. For a Texan, however, I think it becomes something even more than that. Texans who are neither Horns nor Ags will recognize quite a bit of their beloved homeland here. And partisans of these two schools will find their allegiances strengthened and pride reinforced, even while the other side becomes, maybe, a bit more human, a bit less caricature. And everyone will have a good time. I don't think you can ask a lot more from a book than that.	2003-10-02

Like Thomas Fleming's earler [[ASIN:0465024653 The New Dealers' War: FDR and the War Within World War II]], \\"The Illusion of Victory\\" is not only a great survey of events that shaped the modern world, but also a much-needed puncturing of one of the twentieth century's most over-inflated reputations (in the former case, FDR's, in this one Woodrow Wilson's) and a very timely reminder of how war overthrows all aims. Most of all, though, this is just extremely well-written history. It is definitely worth a read.<br /><br />Today, more than three-quarters of a century after the end of the first world war, the myths of that conflict, of America's place in it, and Woodrow Wilson's role in keeping us out, and getting us in, are more pervasive than ever. Fleming reveals not only what a failure Wilson truly was, but how the idealism for which he is so celebrated today was not only sacrificed on the altar of international politicking and hatred, but was poisoned even by the president's own messiah complex and uncompromising partisanship. Fleming paints Wilson as a truly unpleasant figure. And while I can imagine that many readers might consider this an overly negative portrayal -- and accuse Fleming of abandoning the serene and godlike objectivity so many historians maintain (or simulate) -- Fleming has the facts to back up his conclusions. The energy with which Thomas Fleming gores sacred cows like Wilson and FDR is one of his more distinctive characteristics, and it's one I, for my part, particularly value.<br /><br />As I said, there are many especially timely lessons contained in this book. One of the most striking concerns the remarkably vicious campaign against anti-war, or even insufficiently pro-war, elements in the United States, led by the government itself and its partisans. Whatever your opinions on the contemporary \\"USA PATRIOT Act,\\" you'll have to admit that John Ashcroft has not even remotely approached the reign of terror carried out in the U.S. during world war one in the name of \\"100 percent Americanism.\\" This discovery is just one of the many unsettling things readers may learn for the first time between these covers.<br /><br />Another concerns the equally vicious propaganda campaign against Germany, begun in the U.S. by the British and later enthusiastically adopted by the U.S. government. As other observers have argued, enciting hatred seems to be essential to carrying out the war aims of mass democracies. It's not enough to say we disagree with an opposing government's policies; the enemy -- citizens as well as governments -- have to be painted as subhuman, tarred with accusations of unimaginable atrocities, and condemned to nothing less than absolute, crushing defeat. Fleming does an excellent job showing how French, British, and even American leaders participated in the stirring-up of this blood-hatred of the Germans, and incited the American people to give in to it as well. The corollary of this, of course, is that such hatred can't turn on a dime, and it poisoned attempts to craft a peace treaty that solved legitimate grievances and created a new and better world. Fleming reveals, with sometimes painful clarity, how hatred fueled the creation of a Versailles Treaty designed to destroy Germany economically, militarily, and politically for generations to come. We all know the monsters that this created.<br /><br />On the whole, I find it hard to recommend this title *too* enthusiastically. I truly enjoyed the time I spent reading it, regretted having to put it down, and looked forward to when I'd be able to dive in again. It's hard to ask more from a book than that, and when a title is not only entertaining and educational, but challengingly \\"revisionist\\" and eye-opening too ... well, it doesn't get a whole lot better than that.of terror carried out in the U.S. during world war one in the name of \\"100 percent Americanism.\\" This discovery is just one of the many unsettling things readers may learn for the first time between these covers.

But it quickly becomes clear that this story is about a lot more than just a ballpark ... about more, even, than just baseball. If Jim Bouton's first book, &quot;Ball Four&quot; (which I admit to not having read yet, though it's way up on my to-read list now), was a masterpiece of baseball literature, &quot;Foul Ball&quot; is not only a masterpiece of muckraking journalism, it's also simply an engrossing story, very well told.<br />In attempting to save historic Wahconah Park, and professional baseball, in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Bouton and his partners run up against a closed power structure that controls politics, finance, and the town's one daily paper. Over time, the people of Pittsfield rally behind his cause in overwhelming numbers ... or rather, in numbers that would be overwhelming anyplace but Pittsfield. There, the political-financial-media rulers ignore the public, cut their backroom deals, manipulate or intimidate opponents, and steamroll ahead to achieve the outcome they had settled on long ago. It's about money, and accountability, and power -- but mostly, I think, about money. &quot;Everybody's just going to have to live with it.&quot;<br />Bouton tells his story with surprising good humor, considering how infuriating the whole thing is. He is insightful and bold, with a sharp eye for detail and a talent for description. And he literally puts his money where his mouth is, choosing to publish this title himself rather than make the bowdlerizing edits demanded by his initial publishers. I strongly encourage you to reward his risk-taking (and get yourself a darn fine book in the process) by buying one or two copies of &quot;Foul Ball&quot; yourself.	2003-08-26

But it, too, is a fascinating read, and well worth the effort of tracking down -- especially for other K-L fans, but for any student of history, politics, religion, or culture.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with K-L's later works will find many of the themes of those works being developed here. Although (as I realized with a shock about half way through the book) K-L was just 34 when this was published, his distinctive style is already fully developed: assertive, contrarian, polyglot, unapologetically Catholic, and richly sourced and documented. He already has his favorite quotes, his favorite examples, his favorite turns of phrase.<br /><br />And yet, while this book is recognizably K-L, there are many valuable arguments in \\"The Menace of the Herd\\" that make it far more than just a first-draft of \\"Liberty or Equality\\" or \\"Leftism.\\" His central point is a dramatic challenge to \\"herdism\\" and mass democracy (or \\"ochlocracy,\\" as he calls it), in which all positive virtues are overwhelmed the lowest-common-denominator of simple majoritarianism. The positive virtues, for K-L, include piety, aristocracy, responsibility, personalism (which he distinguishes from \\"individualism\\"), and, of course, Catholicism.<br /><br />Within this argument, K-L makes many smaller points that any thoughtful reader will want to turn over in her mind carefully. These include a fascinating discussion of the classical Christian view of rewards in eternity versus happiness in the here-and-now (and how this affects life in predominantly Catholic nations); the harm caused by the modern educational focus on \\"how\\" (science, math) instead of \\"why\\" (philosophy, theology); the myth of militarism and nationalism as conservative or \\"rightist\\" movements (K-L calls this, in caps, the Great Error of the Century); and much more. Just as intriguing and thought-provoking are his asides and footnotes, including the relative sinfulness of despotism versus mob rule, the differences between \\"statism,\\" \\"nationalism,\\" \\"racialism,\\" \\"patriotism,\\" and \\"imperialism,\\" and this gem: \\"Neither are the progressivists, in present-day America, revolutionaries or enemies of the order. Being 'radical' or 'progressive' they merely want to continue with greater speed and determination along the established, wrong trail\\" [p. 218].<br /><br />At the same time, K-L posits some arguments that may well make his conservative and libertarian fans uncomfortable. These include a strong argument against \\"capitalism\\" as a \\"herdist\\" instinct, and the above-mentioned opposition to \\"individualism,\\" as distinguished from \\"personalism.\\" At one point, K-L argues that advertising increases the cost of consumer goods -- a point Mises effectively took apart in chapter 15 of [[ASIN:0865976317 Human Action: A Treatise on Economics]]. This is one aspect of the early K-L that is much less prominent in his later works.<br /><br />Finally, since this book was published in the middle of World War Two, I should note that it contains a fascinating discussion of German and Austrian history, and a study of the cultures and characteristics of \\"the Germanies,\\" that put both world wars in a new and highly intriguing light for me.<br /><br />\\"Liberty and Equality\\" and \\"Leftism Revisited\\" are both, as I've noted elsewhere, books that I return to again and again, trying to absorb the learning and the perspective and get my mind around arguments and insights that are highly counter-intuitive for many Americans -- even contrarians like me -- steeped as we are in a culture that worships \\"democracy\\" and the \\"common man\\" above all else. \\"Menace of the Herd\\" now takes its place beside those other books. I strongly encourage any of my fellow K-L students to expend every effort to get a copy of this for your own library.

The differences between those two books and this one highlight not only the many changes in the Navy itself over five or six decades, but also reinforce why Laura Hall Stavridis' book is so valuable. Whereas the earlier books had a big focus on the social aspects of Navy life (both books were explicitly intended for the officer's wife) and \\"practical\\" tips like how to drive cross-country to visit your husband when he's visiting another port, this book is more thoroughly practical, with an emphasis on the many support systems now in place to help the spouse (male or female) of any Navy person (officer, NCO, or enlisted) deal with the many demands of this challenging position.<br /><br />As with those other books, \\"Navy Spouse's Guide\\" includes a capsule description of the Navy and how it's organized, a glossary of important, and potentially confusing, terms, and other things the reader will be expected to know. At the same time, though, Stavridis knows that the \\"Navy spouse\\" is no longer wedded to the Service in the way she used to be, and that she (or he) most likely has a career and other time-demands of her own.  That's why this book is so useful when confronting situations like preparing for a move overseas ... it's practically a checklist of things to do and people to contact that will help the Navy spouse, who's often left making many of these arrangements, navigate the situation as smoothly and easily as possible.<br /><br />An awful lot has changed between 1942 or 1956 and today, and this book is a powerful reminder of that. But the historical interest is far less important than the day-to-day reality of the modern Navy spouse. Whether you're about to marry into the Navy, or have been following the Fleet for years, I think this is a book you'll find yourself returning to frequently.he situation as smoothly and easily as possible.

Through a wealth of photos and informed commentary, Flusser explains those principles, lays out the \\"How\\" and -- more importantly -- the \\"Why,\\" and even assembles about as comprehensive a glossary as any man not a top-of-the-line tailor is ever likely to need. Some of the ideas, such as how to pair multiple patterns, aren't for beginners. But any man who studies this book and takes the ideas in it to heart will do himself credit, and be a definite improvement to the overall menswear landscape.<br />That's not to say this book is perfect. First, there's the semantic problem in the subtitle, \\"Mastering the Art of Permanent Fashion.\\" \\"Permanent fashion,\\" is, of course, an oxymoron. And as I believe he noted in \\"Clothes and the Man,\\" the principles and approaches he outlines here are rooted in timeless *style,* not changing fashion.<br />More important is the issue of the manipulated photos on pages 26-31. Even before I had told her about the reviews on this page mentioning the obvious doctoring of these images, my wife noted that there was something fishy going on. Her theory had to do with the processing techniques, not the lighting, but the point is the same: there's some publishing trickery going on in an attempt to emphasize the arguments Flusser is making about the effects of various styles of dress. I'm reluctant to hold Flusser himself responsible for this, but it is disappointing that someone resorted to such an obvious trick in order to make the author's point.<br />Still, however, those are only six pages out of more than 300, and don't mar the overall quality and usefulness of the work. If Amazon.com allowed partial stars in its ratings, I'd give this book four and a half, or even four and three-quarters.

Flynn is nevertheless an important one. It's also strangely timely: some of the issues and personalities surrounding the question of \\"Who lost China?\\" have been raised again in Ann Coulter's recent \\"Treason.\\" Coulter readers interested in exploring the question more fully could do far worse than to track down a copy of this title.<br />John T. Flynn, of course, was a tireless slayer of sacred cows, and one of the central figures of the anti-Rooseveltian, anti-New Deal coalition now remembered (by some) as the Old Right. This book deals largely with the question of Communist domination of Asia, in particular China and Korea. But most of the attention is focused in the U.S., and particularly upon the men -- some dupes, some Comsymps (ah, for the good old days of Red-baiting language), and a few dedicated Soviet agents -- in Washington and elsewhere who made that domination possible.<br />A key part of Flynn's thesis is that the print, film, and radio media were deliberately employed to soften Americans' natural opposition to Communist totalitarianism, and to prepare them for the idea of Soviet \\"partnership\\" in the post-World War II era. A large section of the book is filled with examples of pro-Communist propaganda in all three media, and the silencing (contra the \\"McCarthyism\\" myth) of critics of the Russian or Chinese Communists. In partnership with the pro-Communist agitprop (another nearly forgotten term!) were the missteps and blunders committed by political leaders, particularly FDR, Marshall, and Acheson. Truman, too, receives his fair share of blame. But as Flynn notes, most of the seeds of \\"our tragedy in Asia\\" were planted during the FDR years.<br />Does any of this matter any more? Flynn's lessons about the propagandistic power of the media are certainly still relevant and worthy of deep study. And though the guns are silent, China and Korea are certainly still in the headlines. Unraveling the mythology of the rise of Communism in Asia is essential for grappling with the situation there today. Perhaps most important of all is taking the time yet again to knock the pins out from under the vastly inflated reputations of FDR and Truman. Few men have ever performed that valuable service better than John T. Flynn. He deserves to be remembered, and read, with our thanks.e silent, China and Korea are certainly still in the headlines.

But I'll return to it. \\"The Roosevelt Myth\\" is a book that will, I am sure, massively repay repeated readings.<br />In this book, journalist John T. Flynn takes a buzzsaw to one of America's most unjustly inflated reputations. It's hard to describe how incredibly comprehensive his book is. The New Deal -- in all its fraudulent incarnations -- is analyzed, as are FDR's decisions to run for a third, and then a fourth, term. The ways socialists, communists, and other pinkos (Flynn's term) infiltrated ... no, flooded ... into the Roosevelt Administration and used it for their own purposes in war and peace are made shockingly clear, as is the way America' war propaganda system was used to promote Joe Stalin and slander and smear American anti-communists. The way FDR's wife and children used his name to make themselves rich is also thoroughly explored, as is the growth of the Regulatory State, a Roosevelt invention, as a tool of political, economic, and social control.<br />In my Amazon.com review of Thomas Fleming's \\"The New Dealers' War: FDR and the War Within World War II\\" (Basic Books: 2001), I said that it sometimes seemed FDR viewed the New Deal more as an electoral ploy than an ideological commitment. Flynn makes it clear (I wish I'd read this book before Fleming's) that there's no \\"seemed\\" about it: the New Deal never was anything but an electoral ploy. The New Deal Roosevelt campaigned on in 1932 was jettisoned before he even entered office. The one he introduced in the First Hundred Days had a different philosophical foundation, different programs, and different goals. The so-called \\"Third New Deal,\\" several years later, was yet again different from the two that preceded it. In short, the New Deal was a political bait-and-switch operation from the very beginning.<br />The reason the New Deal wasn't ideological, Flynn argues again and again, is that FDR himself was a man with no fundamental philosophy of government, no understanding of economics or finance, and no objective beyond maximizing the votes he would receive at the next election. He stumbled from policy to policy, and crisis to crisis, looking only for ways to gain political advantage.<br />(Flynn makes it clear, for example, that FDR deliberately refused to work with the lame-duck President Hoover to mitigate the effects of the Depression in the winter of 1932-33. FDR wanted to make sure the crisis got as bad as possible, so Republicans would be demonized and himself celebrated as the man who single-handedly turned the economy around. Years later, as the Depression got even worse, FDR seriously considered throwing the 1940 election so the GOP would be in the White House when the economy hit bottom a second time. Then, he and the Democrats would ride to the rescue again in 1944. The onset of World War II in Europe convinced him to scrap this idea and run for a third term immediately.)<br />\\"The Roosevelt Myth\\" has a great deal of application for the twenty-first century reader. For example, \\"Any unfavorable turn [Roosevelt] attributed to a secret plot of his enemies. Any criticism of his measures he put down to some secret hatred of him personally\\" [Book 2, chapter 3]. Or, \\"Roosevelt's apologists have sought to dismiss Pegler's charges, not by refuting the facts, but by calling him a Roosevelt-hater\\" [footnote, Book 3, chapter 3]. Or, \\"There was a wide streak of egotism in Roosevelt which made it impossible for him in some circumstances to perceive the fine line that divides correct from improper conduct in public office -- especially in so exalted an office as the presidency\\" [Book 3, chapter 3].<br />Substitute \\"Clinton\\" for \\"Roosevelt\\" in the sentences above quoted, or in countless other examples I could have quoted, and who can say this is not a dead-on portrayal of America's 42nd president?<br />Today, the mythic portrayal of FDR as the man who saved America and then stepped forward (ahead of his isolationist people) to save the world, is stronger than ever. That makes \\"The Roosevelt Myth\\" as essential a read as it ever was. Whatever you're reading, put it down and read this first.(ahead of his isolationist people) to save the world, is stronger than ever. That makes \\"The Roosevelt Myth\\" as essential a read as it ever was. Whatever you're reading, put it down and read this first.	2003-08-07

But few, I'd bet, traced the school's history through the particular prism of the uniforms worn by the cadets. Although this title is nearly a half-century old, many of the uniforms of 1955 are being worn today with little or no modification. And that makes this book not only an interesting history, but also a reasonably useful guide for today.<br />Although this book seems to have been written, perhaps, for a younger audience, it's still a worthwhile resource for any reader. The many photographs and drawings are well-explained, and helpful appendices at the back include sketches of the various chevrons worn by cadet NCOs and officers. The text contains a fair summary of cadet life on post, and how the various uniforms fit into the myriad activities carried on at the USMA and by cadets in the field.<br />The most obvious change between 1955 and today is the arrival of female cadets, which of course produced a whole new raft of uniforms, or uniform variants, that could be included in an updated study. But for the period from 1802 until when it was published, this book is a rewarding look at what cadets wore, and what sorts of things they did while they were wearing it.	2003-08-02

There are a wide variety of photos, ranging from cadet life in general to field maneuvers, hops, classwork, and more. Simpson also pays attention to architectural developments and the history of faculty and staff. Notably, he also spends a lot of time covering the impact West Pointers had on their country far away from the USMA, most notably in the settling of the West and campaigns in the Spanish War and World War I.<br />As I said, with all the other West Point histories produced in the last few years, this title is hardly an essential one. But it's still worth a browse, and for collectors of USMA history and memorabilia, may well be worth a place on the shelf.	2003-08-02

I've read a lot of books about West Point and other American military academies. The one thing nearly every author has difficulty conveying is a full, comprehensive picture of a cadet's (or midshipman's, as appropriate) day to day life: what he expected, what he confronts, what he hopes for. I finally found some of that in Ed Ruggero's &quot;Duty First&quot; (2001). But David Lipsky's &quot;Absolutely American&quot; eclipses even that. If Lipsky's access to the USMA and its students was unprecedented, the book he produced amply deserves that accolade too.<br />This book is an engrossing look into the lives of a number of West Point cadets and their officers. I frequently found myself reading 50 pages at a stretch. The pace is quick, yet it never felt rushed. Whatever your personality type or opinions of the Academy, chances are you'll find someone to sympathize with and root for, whether it's the hard-charging, *huah* Mark Thompson, the conflicted &quot;Whitey&quot; Herzog, the hard-luck George Rash, or any of several others. Lipsky's ability to paint full portraits of these cadets during this critical time in their lives shouldn't be underestimated.<br />One of the inevitable elements of any West Point book is the argument over whether the Academy has &quot;gone soft&quot; in the years since ... well, generally since whoever's speaking attended there. That same debate is part of this book too, and it shapes much of the dramatic tension that gives the book its almost novel-like quality. It's easy to take sides, but there aren't any easy answers: Should George Rash have been driven from the Academy, or was he being unfairly picked on? Was LtCol Keirsey a hero, a villain, or just a fall guy to &quot;political correctness&quot;? Is Captain Paredes a martinet, or a defender of Academy standards? This book raises a lot of questions that civilians as well as military types should be willing to give thought to.<br />It's easy to think of the cadets in this book as characters. But now, they're out on the front lines (in fact, I read the section about one cadet's decision to post to a new light-infantry battalion located near Seattle on the same day I saw on the TV news that that very battalion is about to be shipped to Iraq; presumably he's going with them). I predict the people the reader meets in these pages will stick with him for a long time after the book is complete.<br />In fact, as I read &quot;Absolutely American,&quot; I kept having two thoughts. One was that it would be great to revisit these now-former cadets every few years ... like Michael Apted's famous series of British documentaries, &quot;Seven Up,&quot; &quot;Seven Plus Seven,&quot; &quot;14 Up,&quot; and so on ... to see how they're doing. The second thought, being someone naturally more sympathetic to the sea services than to the Army, was, &quot;I wish someone would do this for Annapolis too.&quot;<br />So, Mr. Lipsky: Do you have any plans for the next four years?rs.

In most cases, these books seem to have the common approach of taking questionable insights and reducing them to trite slogans.<br />This book isn't like that. As an in-depth view of &quot;America's premier leadership school&quot; (if it does say so itself), this book not only contains valuable lessons on leadership, but was also about the best and most comprehensive book I've ever read on any of the federal service academies ... at least until I read David Lipsky's remarkable &quot;Absolutely American&quot; (2003). But &quot;Duty First&quot; is still head and shoulders above most of the rest.<br />When the Army prepared to write a report on how leaders are developed at the US Military Academy (aka West Point), they discovered that, in fact, there wasn't any formal training doctrine at all. The lessons of leadership, and the means of transmitting them, had developed informally over time.<br />As a result, West Point cadets are not spoon-fed maxims and &quot;principles.&quot; Instead, they're put in positions where they can draw conclusions and learn lessons via their own experiences. Ed Ruggero follows the same course: In telling us the stories of a handful of cadets during their journey through the Academy, he doesn't bludgeon us with &quot;The point of that was...&quot; We learn as the cadets do -- and if we, or they, don't pick up some insights about leadership from this, maybe we, like they, aren't paying close enough attention.<br />As I said, this book isn't just about leadership. It's also an extremely good guide to the life of a cadet at the USMA.<br />Having not long before read Catherine Manegold's &quot;In Glory's Shadow&quot; about The Citadel, I was struck by the vast difference between that school's &quot;adversarial&quot; approach to cadet training, and West Point's team-based, but still rigorous, method. Of course, West Point used to be &quot;adversarial&quot; too. But, as Ruggero explains, that approach has been abandoned, in part because it was judged a failure in preparing cadets for the &quot;real world&quot; of commanding soldiers in the field. This book doesn't settle the Old Way Versus New Way debate by any means, but is a strong argument in favor of a training regime based on a desire to succeed, instead of fear of failure and (what some would call) abuse.<br />I would strongly encourage any young person interested in attending a service academy, or any parent of a current or prospective cadet, to buy this book and read it closely. MBA students and business leaders looking for leadership lessons from a school that has been training leaders for two centuries will find a lot to profit from too.but still rigorous, method.

While I don't agree with everything in this book, I have a great deal of respect for Hitchens' articulate rationality. It's a refreshing change from both the hysteric emotionalism and nitwit slogans of much of the antiwar crowd, and the chest-thumping militarism of a great deal of the pro-war element.<br />Especially useful ... or would be if anyone besides Hitchens, me, and the specter of George Orwell still cared about precision and clarity in the language ... is the author's dissection of many of the key terms in this debate, including \\"terrorism,\\" \\"multi-\\" versus \\"bi-\\" in lateralism and partisanship, \\"regime change,\\" \\"imperialism,\\" and much more. The article titled \\"'Cowboy' -- Bush challenged by bovines\\" did, I think, a better job of identifying the political context of President Bush's \\"Texanness\\" and its impact on his actions in office than Michael Lind did in all 224 pages of his book \\"Made in Texas.\\"<br />In our modern democratic culture, of course, rational thought actually counts for very little -- not when shallow slogans like \\"No blood for oil!\\" are considered the last word in persuasive arguments (the author gives that one the deconstruction it deserves too). But for those who do value intelligent political debate, or just simple intellectual honesty, Hitchens' are the pro-war arguments that need to be answered.	2003-08-01

I have to admit that there's a certain element of cartoonishness to Ann Coulter's work as well. It's easy to picture her eyes bugging out and hair spinning around in rage, steam shooting out her ears, as she fulminates against some lie from the American Left. It's easy to get hung up on that -- as indeed the Left has been hung up on Joe McCarthy for 50 years -- but to do so would be to ignore the very important points Coulter is making.<br />The comparison to McCarthy is an apposite one, and one I'm sure the author herself wouldn't object to. Indeed, substitute her name for McCarthy's in several of her defenses of him, and the argument still makes perfect sense (e.g., \\"Lost amid all the mandatory condemnations of Joe McCarthy's name -- he gave anti-Communism a bad name, did a disservice to the cause, was an unnecessary distraction -- the little detail about his being right always seems to get lost\\" [p. 71].)<br />Writing as a free-market anarchist (or \\"anarcho-capitalist\\") with roots in, and a remaining sympathy for, the conservative movement, I think one of the great values of this title is the light it shines on issues that all too many conservatives seem to consider resolved. From what I've read, many College Republicans and other young conservatives seem unaware of the history and context of their movement, and too willing to accept the myths, fed and sustained by the Left, that (among other things), McCarthy was the worst evil to stalk the face of the earth and Truman was a great Cold War president. Neither of these, of course, is true. And the former lie, Coulter argues, is especially obscene, given that nothing McCarthy did compares even remotely to the things Joe Stalin was doing at the same time, and that Stalin's crimes were often endorsed or covered-up for by the very people McCarthy is alleged to have \\"destroyed.\\"<br />Treason, of course, is a serious accusation to make, whether you're Joe McCarthy or Ann Coulter. And it's certainly open to debate whether the American Left was always *consciously* in alignment with the aims and policies of the Soviet Union. At the same time, it's clear that, exactly as Coulter notes, \\"liberals think they should be able to root for the reds without anyone being so uncouth as to point out they are rooting for the reds\\" (p. 177). Another of the great values of Coulter's book is to shake up conservatives who place gentlemanly comity ahead of defending liberty.<br />But in the struggle of freedom versus tyranny, the object is not to accommodate the other side, get along with, or establish a d&eacute;tente with them, but to defeat them and render them unable to impose their collectivist aims on free individuals. As Coulter argues, that's what Reagan understood about the Soviets that made him such a threat to international socialists at home and abroad. And it's what Ann Coulter understands about domestic Leftists. In style and substance, Coulter may sometimes be less than perfect. But she understands what the fight is about, and that's worth an awful lot.br />Treason, of course, is a serious accusation to make, whether you're Joe McCarthy or Ann Coulter.

While their political success was small, however, the ripples of their intellectual impact continue to be felt today. And so while parts of this book, one of the most articulate presentations of the agrarian position, are somewhat dated, there's still a lot of value for modern readers.<br />The book got off to a slow start for me. Davidson's presentation of the theory and history of American regionalism, in a section titled &quot;The Nation We Are,&quot; is important, but much of it summarizes, or reacts to, the work of historians and sociologists now even more obscure than the Agrarians themselves (Frederick Jackson Turner being a notable exception). While Davidson makes important points about the endogenous or organic nature of regions, regional characteristics, and regional loyalties -- in distinction to the imposed, artificial, and largely arbitrary nature of political divisions like counties or states -- his focus on the social science of the 1930s is not a terrifically compelling read today.<br />Once we get past that first section, though, things are much more rewarding. This is particularly true of the second section, titled &quot;Immovable Bodies and Irresistible Forces,&quot; which focuses on defining the characteristics of various American regions and the people who live there. I especially enjoyed &quot;Still Rebels, Still Yankees,&quot; which contrasts Brother Jonathan of Yankeetown, Vermont, with Cousin Roderick of Rebelville, Georgia. &quot;The Two Old Wests,&quot; an exploration of how frontier, geographic, and cultural influences blended, with very different results, in the Old Southwest (Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and later Texas) and Old Northwest (Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and other parts of the modern Midwest), was fascinating. And &quot;The Great Plains,&quot; a pr&eacute;cis of Walter Prescott Webb's important book of the same title with Davidson's own expanded commentary, extends the analysis to the foothills of the Rockies. As a Seattle resident, I would have liked to have seen Davidson carry his discussion all the way to the Pacific coast. I can't complain about what he did do, though.<br />Entertaining and valuable as all this is, the most useful section for modern students of politics and regionalism might be the chapter titled &quot;Expedients vs. Principles -- Cross-Purposes in the South.&quot; Davidson here makes a number of important, and still timely, points, including illustrating how attacks on the &quot;backward&quot; South are frequently Trojan horses for the imposition of another, usually Northeastern, political or social agenda. The author also argues, contra those who say the Constitution and federalist system are outdated because &quot;the Founders couldn't foresee&quot; the nature of modern society, that indeed, Jefferson and his contemporaries did foresee the coming of large-scale industrialism and the destructive effects it would have on agrarian society.<br />Reading Davidson today, one can't help but wonder whether things are much worse, or perhaps a little better, than during his day. One the one hand, monopoly industrialism has in many ways yielded to &quot;the new economy&quot; driven by high technology. On the other hand, American culture seems more monolithic than ever, thanks to mass media and popular culture that are far more pervasive and homogenizing than in the '30s. Are there any discernable differences between the twenty-first century great-grandchildren of Brother Jonathan and Cousin Roderick?

This title, published in 1928, is a fairly standard example of the genre. It has some primary-source interest for contemporary reader interested in period snapshots, but is hardly an engrossing book any more.<br />The author, LtCol. P.T. Etherton, is identified on the title page as \\"Late H.M. Consul-General in Chinese Turkestan [sic] and additional Assistant Judge of H.M. Supreme Court for China.\\" As you'd therefore expect, this book has more of a focus on Commonwealth- and Empire-related issues than some others of the era, and also a good deal of first-hand observations on China. But most of it analyses the rise of Japan and the various sources of tension between Japan and the West, and speculation on the conduct and consequences of war.<br />It's this last that might be most interesting to readers looking to see how well Colonel Etherton's crystal ball was functioning. There's some entertainment value in that, keeping in mind the clich&eacute; about hindsight always being 20/20. But apart from that and the aforementioned value of a first-person description of the tensions and assumptions of the era, there's probably little in here to reward freeing this title from the musty back shelves to which it's been consigned for decades.	2003-07-08

His side is ennobled. The folks he dislikes are painted with the broadest brush.

Texas, after all, &#34;is a Southern state masquerading as a Western state&#34; (p. 25) -- just like the evil triumvirate of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia so frequently invoked in these pages. This is the nightrider that haunts progressive sleep: the evil, backward, racist South, out to impose theocracy, militarism, and low tax rates. And it explains why the election of George W. Bush constitutes a &#34;Southern takeover of American politics,&#34; while the Clinton Long March, under a President from Arkansas, a veep from Tennessee, and an attorney general from Florida, apparently does not.<br /><br />In fact, Lind wraps so many of his favorite themes up in cartoonish colors that &#34;Made in Texas&#34; may as well have been sold on newsprint. Nuance? What nuance?  &#34;Today's Southern right combines the political economy of plantation owners with the fundamentalist religion of hillbillies&#34; (p. 164). Ah, of course. Say no more, Michael.<br /><br />This kind of cartoonish reductionism is found throughout -- from Lind's assertion that the Southern aristocracy's post-Civil War goal was to make the South a resource colony of the North (as if it wasn't already that by 1860), to a weird kind of real-estate determinism that links George W. Bush with the worst excesses of racial violence because of the location of his ranch. (The author also treats us to this coy aside: &#34;As it happens, the George Herbert Walker Bush Library at Texas A&M in College Station, like the younger Bush's ranch, is in the heart of the historic Texas lynching belt&#34; [p. 8]. As it happens, indeed!) Fortunately, however, the Texas Hill Country, home of LBJ (and Michael Lind!), is still a land of truth, love, beauty, and progressivism.<br /><br />Lind is frankly less entertaining when he turns away from explaining Texas and hits his other favorite themes, the Christian Right, and the nefarious influence of Pat Robertson. He argues that the 2000 election was a progressive landslide, with only &#34;rural overrepresentation in the Electoral College&#34; (pp. 76, 77, 79, 107, etc.) and Senate preventing this fact from being reflected throughout the federal government. Darn that pesky Constitution! (It should be noted in passing that Lind's apparent belief that the small and/or rural states should be deprived of their equal representation in the Senate and weight in the electoral college is in fact far *more* revolutionary than is the contention that Bush won fair and square. See, for example, Daniel Patrick Moynihan on electoral college &#34;reform.&#34;)<br /><br />In short, the moral of this story is that progressives can take comfort: G.W. Bush and his home state can be pigeonholed just where you want them to be. For all its efforts to sell itself as something unique and wonderful, Texas is really just Mississippi in a big stupid hat. For readers not equipped with progressive blinders, treat this like the Sunday funnies. It's almost as disposable.y just Mississippi in a big stupid hat.

Even ones lucky enough to be republished, like this title was in the 1970s, attract little attention. That's too bad, because by cracking one of these old books, the interested reader can learn a lot about the American mindset, military and civilian, in the decades before World War Two.<br />This particular title was a good one to reprint, for Colonel W. Jefferson Davis gave us a fine example of the genre. First published in 1927, &quot;Japan: The Air Menace of the Pacific&quot; combines military and naval analysis with a look at domestic American politics. Many of his strategic arguments were right on, if not absolutely original, and focus on the need for the U.S. to develop a strong air arm to counter the growing strength of Japan. If his emphasis on the vulnerability of the Panama Canal seems overstated today, much of it is the benefit of hindsight. Still, it's hard to fault (apart from some of the language) a conclusion like, &quot;What does this mean to America? It means that the Yellow Ace of the Imperial Islands will dominate the Pacific; that her bombing planes will make our battleship a thing obsolete; that she can at will take the Philippines and Hawaii, ... no doubt in time we could wear her down, but it would be a long and humiliating struggle&quot; (p. 65).<br />Another element of this genre is a question often forgotten today: the concern that American treatment of Japanese immigrants to the U.S., and the passage of laws limiting their rights and restricting their movements, could provide a pretext for a declaration of war by Imperial Japan. Colonel Davis takes for granted the &quot;unassimilability&quot; of Japanese immigrants, their loyalty to the Empire, and the right of the American &quot;race&quot; to protect itself from an influx of foreigners. Here, again, he is typical of his genre. But in fairness, I should note that -- apart from, as I mentioned above, some language no longer considered acceptable -- Davis's book notably lacks the scurrilous racism evident in some other titles on this theme.<br />For readers interested in the cultural conditions in the era before the War, as well as a fairly clear-eyed assessment of the military challenges we faced, this book is a good primary source. Readers wanting to discover the era in its own words could do worse than to add this to their reading list.protect itself from an influx of foreigners. Here, again, he is typical of his genre.

But here, it doesn't edge into discussions of European agricultural policy or the historic despoiling of the British countryside. Instead, explanations of the organic method are an underlying, but essential, part of telling the garden's story<br />The narrative of how the garden has developed over two decades is an interesting one, and any gardener will enjoy and be inspired by the beautiful photography. And although few of us are able to garden on the Prince's scale, there is still an awful lot in here we can learn from, adapt to our own uses, or blatantly poach -- from simple decorating and arranging ideas to complex schemes of crop rotation or building construction. Helpfully, Highgrove's head gardener, David Howard, includes a chapter explaining how the transition from traditional gardening to organic approaches began, and some of the key techniques he employs and lessons he's learned. This is followed by six entire pages of listings of various types of plants cultivated in the different gardens and illustrated in each chapter. This, especially, may prove to be a handy resource for many readers.<br />If there's one noticeable drawback to this book, it's that there's no overall map or diagram showing where the various gardens are in relation to one another and the house. All I can think is that (assuming there is a reason for not including one) this may be for security purposes -- though that seems unlikely given the number of photographs already included. But after taking an otherwise thorough tour through the kitchen garden, the walled garden, the box garden, the fountain garden, across the terrace, past the sanctuary, under the rose arch, down the thyme walk (my favorite), along the serpentine hedge ... and all the rest, it would have been nice to have a comprehensive view of how it all fits together.<br />After having read the earlier title about this garden, it was nice to return six or seven years later (in publishing time) and see how it's all progressing. As the quote on the back cover says, &quot;The Prince of Wales has created at Highgrove one of the most admired gardens in the country,&quot; and from philosophy to planning to execution, it's a garden that through this book, we can learn things from or, if we prefer, simply sit back and enjoy.ross the terrace, past the sanctuary, under the rose arch, down the thyme walk (my favorite), along the serpentine hedge ... and all the rest, it would have been nice to have a comprehensive view of how it all fits together.<br />After having read the earlier title about this garden, it was nice to return six or seven years later (in publishing time) and see how it's all progressing.

Lee (Penguin Lives)	Books	5	18	22	N	N	Very successful at what it sets out to be	This is the fourth Penguin Lives title I've read (the other three being Auchincloss on Wilson, Keegan on Churchill, and Johnson on Napoleon), and for pure biography, this one is the best of the four. Other reviewers who criticize the relative superficiality of Blount's analysis need to recognize that the Penguin Lives are not intended to be comprehensive, ground-breaking studies. That just couldn't be done in under 200 pages.<br />No, these books -- essays, almost -- are introductions to, surveys of, key historical figures. The question shouldn't be, Did Blount give us all the answers about Lee? but rather, Has Blount painted a sharp enough portrait that we have a clear idea of who the man was, why he did what he did, and what impact his life had? I think the answer to that latter question is a decisive Yes.<br />Unlike Keegan and Johnson, Blount is not a professional historian. But he's done a fine job with a subject all biographers admit to be a man very difficult to get close to. This fact in itself forms part of Blount's theme, as he explores the roots of Lee's famous reserve and inapproachability. He largely avoids pop psychoanalysis -- when he wades into those waters, he tells us he's doing so -- and his insights seem to make sense.<br />I particularly appreciated the way Blount addressed the issue that defines (many, if not most) modern treatments of Lee: the question of whether he can justly be called a Great Man while having fought, if not explicitly for slavery itself, at least for a nation and a culture in which slavery played a central role. The fact that Blount sees nuances to the discussion, instead of making the absolute, unarguable, definitive statement \\"Lee = slavery = evil\\", may cause ideologues, or people who just don't know any better, to reject his reasonings entirely.  But that would be their loss because this section, too, is rewarding reading.<br />I said this book is good pure biography. That's because Blount is an excellent writer and storyteller, as well as a fine presenter and interpreter of facts. As a \\"humorist,\\" (I've always hated that term), he has a keen eye for the ridiculous, both in human behavior and in historians' more labored interpretations.<br />So, no, this isn't a scholarly, definitive, biography that will become the new gold standard in Civil War Studies. But as a highly readable thumbnail portrait of one of the most loved and reviled, admired, misunderstood, and dare I say, greatest, figures in American history, I think it will be hard to beat.teller, as well as a fine presenter and interpreter of facts.

Similarly, his name on the cover of this book, and the beautiful color photos that illustrate it, may get many readers to give it an initial browse. But what they'll find inside is much different than the guided tour of a garden they may be expecting (for that, they should check out HRH's [[ASIN:1841881422 The Garden at Highgrove]] 2000). Instead, it's a manifesto of sorts -- a defiant defense of an organic approach to agriculture that is a polite but unmistakable challenge to agribusiness orthodoxy.<br /><br />The parts of this book I found most interesting were the first and last chapters, the parts penned by the Prince himself. They give a bit of his personal history with the Highgrove estate, his goals in converting from traditional to organic farming, and some of what he encountered after doing so. The last chapter, particularly, also lays out some of the lessons he's learned so far (circa 1993, of course) and how he believes it applies to the larger questions confronting agriculture in the UK.<br /><br />The earlier chapters in Mr. Clover's section are also interesting, focusing as they do on The Prince's decision to purchase Highgrove and some of his early steps in \\"going organic.\\" The latter chapters, unfortunately, become more and more weighted with questions of politics and policy, as he argues the economic and environmental benefits of organic farming. These chapters remind the reader how incredibly interventionist both the British government and the European Union are in matters that, in this country, are regarded as far more private. The restrictions on farmland use, especially, struck me as remarkably onerous. If that's what \\"Rio\\" and related international accords (still more Kyoto) bring in their wake, Americans should read and ponder these chapters very carefully before we assent to them ourselves.<br /><br />The Prince's chapters, especially, reminded me a lot of American agriculture writer Gene Logsdon, author of [[ASIN:189013256X Living at Nature's Pace: Farming and the American Dream]] among other works. I hope, in fact, that HRH has read some of Mr. Logsdon's titles -- I think he'll find much in there to admire, and much to think about.<br /><br />On a stylistic level, I enjoy reading The Prince's prose -- I did in [[ASIN:038526903X A Vision of Britain: A Personal View of Architecture]] and did so again here. His is an entertaining and very personal pen, articulate, reasonable, self-effacing, and not afraid to take a counter-cultural stand. I was disappointed to see that some of The Prince's recommendations also veered into the government-interventionist, but to that degree at least I suppose he is a product of his society and era.<br /><br />On the whole, this book may not convince large-scale farmers to abandon traditional agribusiness and convert to organic approaches, but I suspect that was not the authors' intent. If, however, it succeeds (or succeeded) in getting consumers and/or casual gardeners or farmers to think a bit more about where their food comes from and how it was produced, I would imagine the authors consider it a success.

And not long after we became a combattant, we realized the need for a ship that could carry more cargo, and do it faster, than the Liberties. Hence the Victory ships, a class that ultimately included tankers, troopships, and other auxlilary types, as well as basic cargo ships. This book is a catalog of the Victory ships, and also of purpose-built tankers, and their role in the war.<br />When I say this book is a &quot;catalog,&quot; that pretty much sums it up. Much of the text consists of lists of individual ships of the various classes, divided up by where they were built, and including launch date, the name or names they sailed under, their post-war disposition, and ultimate (as of 1974, anyway) fate.<br />You won't find here any of the stories of heroism at sea, battles against fierce odds, clashes with the elements in the storm-tossed seas, or any of those other fixtures of war-at-sea literature. Although the descriptions of individual ships sometimes include interesting details (like the brief recounting of the MUHLENBERG VICTORY's stint as a livestock carrier, with cows berthed in &quot;first class&quot; accomodations, or the explosion of the tanker SALEM MARITIME in Louisiana in 1956), there's little mention of the ships' wartime service, either generally or specifically. There are, however, many details of design, construction, engines, modifications, and other technical specifications.<br />A number of the Victory ships are described as being mothballed as part of the US Navy's reserve fleet. Of course, thirty years later, I'd be surprised to learn if there are still any Victories so disposed. Though there might not be much call for updating this particular volume, that is one area in which it is particularly out of date. But for an overview history of some important classes of ships, and basic details about each of the members of those classes, this book might be a useful thing for interested researchers to have around.e members of those classes, this book might be a useful thing for interested researchers to have around.	2003-06-20

The resulting fire soon led to a massive explosion that destroyed the ships, much of the harbor, and a good part of the surrounding city. The scope and impact of the tragedy is almost unimaginable. And yet, according to author John Griffith Armstrong, the event is largely forgotten by Canadians and almost universally unknown to Americans. That's too bad -- not only for the sake of the people killed or wounded, but also for the lessons we can still learn from the event and its aftermath today. Armstrong's book shows us why.<br />As the author notes early in his book, the Halifax explosion, to the extent it's been studied by historians at all, is generally approached from a sociological viewpoint that concentrates on the event's impact on the people of Halifax. Armstrong's brief is different. He analyses the effect of the explosion and subsequent investigation on the Royal Canadian Navy.<br />In so doing, he's created a surprisingly interesting story that, while it gets a little bogged down in the minutia of inquiry transcripts quoted at length, nevertheless develops a number of themes that are still relevant today. For example: the tendency of military and political bureaucracies to obfuscate, shift blame, and throw others to the wolves in order to protect themselves (and the difficulties military and civilian bureaucracies have in communicating with, or even understanding, one another); the dangers that result from unclear divisions of responsibility; the ease with which opportunistic politicians can manipulate and enflame public opinion; and much more.<br />It's also very interesting to see the developing institutional ethos of the Royal Canadian Navy, which had existed as a nominally independent body for less than a decade at the time of the explosion.<br />On the whole, this book is a study of bureaucracy, legal proceedings, and institutional evolution that frankly may not appeal to a lot of people. But for students of disasters, institutions, the navy, or just an overlooked chapter in Canadian history, this title has a lot to recommend it.lot of people.

Where I'm afraid this book is somewhat lacking is in analyzing and interpreting those facts, and in giving the reader an overall assessment of her life and impact. For example, his coverage of her years of illness and confinement in various sanatoria is quite thorough. But he never quite stepped back and gave us an objective discussion of what was afflicting her and whether the way she was treated for it was appropriate. Similarly, while readers who know something about Prince Philip and the British royal family may be able to draw some conclusions about Alice's effectiveness as a mother, Vickers never explicitly states any conclusions he may have drawn about how Alice's character, or her years of estrangement from her children, may have affected Philip's own parenting skills or colored his own relations with his children (certainly a subject numerous other writers have found worthy of attention). There are other examples I could cite.<br />On the whole, this biography will probably be most useful to readers who are already relatively familiar with the royal caste of characters (if you will) of Alice's era. While Vickers helpfully includes family trees in the back of his book, the text is so full of the inevitable royal nicknames (Dicky, Tiny, Wooly, Ernie, Dolla, Big George, Drino, Onor, and so on), keeping all the players straight can be a bit of a challenge.

Unfortunately, while the story gets off to a good start, it's weighed down by a long middle section in which little progress seems to be made in solving the murder mystery, which is, of course, the point of the story. Instead, this central part (about half the book, in fact) is full of character development (not in itself bad) and a lot of discussion of the hothouse environment of Academy life. For people like me who are interested in questions of military education, this section has certain rewards. However, for people who are mainly interested in a murder mystery regardless of setting, these 200 pages would probably be somewhat of a drag.<br />About page 300, though, the plot picks up its pace, and keeps charging ahead with action and revelation right up to the very last page. Readers interested in a fast-moving, dramatic showdown might even find it worthwhile to skim the book until chapter 12, and then dive in there in earnest. You'd miss some of the plot threads that get tied up in the end, but you'd skip all the slow parts too.<br />It's hard to tell whether the author is trying to make a political point about some of the people who are being admitted to the Academy these days. Without giving away much of the plot, I'll note that questions like \\"How could someone like this make it into Annapolis?\\" are raised, by the characters themselves, throughout the story. By intention or oversight, Deutermann seems to leave this question largely unanswered -- and indeed, makes it more pressing than ever given some of the final plot twists.<br />But that issue is no doubt secondary to the quality of the story itself. I did like several of the characters here, and thought the setting believable, the story plausible, and the action, tension, and pacing (at least in the final section) brisk. General mystery fans could probably enjoy this as much if it were 100 pages shorter, but those of us who like reading about military academies will find the whole thing worth the read.l mystery fans could probably enjoy this as much if it were 100 pages shorter, but those of us who like reading about military academies will find the whole thing worth the read.	2003-06-11

Jumping ahead to this, his most recent work, has therefore been a bit of a revelation to me. Maybe I should start with his most current titles, and work my way backwards instead.<br />Many of Reeman's earlier novels, the ones I'm most familiar with, tended to be somewhat formulaic, with the usual character mix of the heroic young officer (probably in the Reserve), the crusty, martinet career RN officer, recalled &quot;off the beach&quot; for war service, and The Girl, who serves primarily as the heroic young officer's love interest. These titles generally feature one particular Important Mission, along with a touch of interpersonal conflict, romance, and epic -- and always well-written -- battle scenes.<br />&quot;Twelve Seconds to Live&quot; contains characters who are similar to the three standard profiles, but quite a few others as well. In fact, this is the most densely-peopled Reeman book I can remember, with at least two (possibly three) men who could qualify as Our Heroes, two interesting and well-drawn female characters, a host of supporting officers, Wrens, and men, and several different featured boats and vessels.<br />Reeman's plot makes rich use of all these resources. There is an Important Mission, but it doesn't really develop until relatively late in the novel. Much of the story is a slice-of-life look at service in the Special Countermeasures unit and the taxing work of defusing unexploded mines and other enemy ordnance. Some of the characters interact with the others only tangentially, and few are involved in the final Important Mission. But the whole thing ties together well, with a good mixture of intrigue, danger, romance (one romance in particular rather unusual for a Reeman work), and action at sea.<br />Although some Reeman books are better than others, I've found nearly all of them a treat to read. This one was no different, and I believe any fan will probably come to the same conclusion.all of them a treat to read.

Tres is a great guy and a great character. Even in the deepest mysteries or most desperate straits, he always strikes me as someone who's basically in control, and a fun guy to hang out with.<br />The characters in &quot;Cold Springs&quot; aren't like that.<br />If the Navarre stories are fast-paced and entertaining, &quot;Cold Springs&quot; is edgy and uncomfortable. All of the characters are tense and troubled. All their lives are dark and desperate. And with one or two exceptions, none of them were ultimately particularly easy to be around. Even Chadwick, our hero, is battling too many demons ever to feel comfortable with. In fact, I never felt comfortable in this story at all, never able to relax, and never certain about what might be around the next corner.<br />I loved it.<br />&quot;Cold Springs&quot; has all the intricate plotting we've come to expect from Rick Riordan. Suspicion points at one character, and then another. Nobody seems trustworthy, not even our hero. But when you finally reach the resolution, most everything falls into place. As you read this, keep in mind the subtitle on the front cover: &quot;A Novel of Secrets.&quot; Secrets are always being revealed -- right up to the very end.<br />Riordan's plot is complex and winding, but his characterizations deserve praise too. As I read this, I was reminded of Tolstoy's famous opening line, &quot;All happy families are alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&quot; Here, every miserable, troubled person is miserable and troubled in his or her own way, and each of them, including the several teenagers, is true to life (or at least convincing to someone like me who has mercifully avoided that kind of misery in my own life). And unlike the Navarre books, this story is told in third-person, and from multiple viewpoints.

Sir Steven Runciman was one of the English language's (if not the world's) leading scholars of the Crusades and the Eastern Roman Empire, and this brief but powerful book shows why. Norwich and his popular-history volumes of Byzantine history may be a more contemporary, personality-driven look at the story, but nobody can match, in my opinion, Runciman for both breadth of scholarship and elegant, intelligent, and highly readable prose.<br /><br />Runciman shows that the fall of Constantinople to the Turks on May 29, 1453 (550 years ago today!) was both inevitable and of mostly marginal historical significance  (except, of course, to the people of the city itself). It had always seemed to me an event of epochal importance -- history's pages finally slamming shut on the Roman Empire. But in literally his first sentence, Sir Steven disabuses us of this notion, or that the fall marked the close of the Middle Ages. Indeed, \\"only the Papacy and a few scholars and romanticists had been genuinely shocked at the thought of the great historic Christian city passing into the hands of the infidel\\" (p. 179). For the most part, it was part of the rising tide of Turkish conquest, alarming in a general way, but not immediately catastrophic to the dying empire's fickle co-religionists in the West.<br /><br />Runciman's narrative is engrossing, full of political tension, military conflict, and the religious disputes that always colored Byzantine history. His characterizations are insightful, his descriptions colorful, his writing elegiac -- at times even poetic -- well-sourced (both Christian and Muslim authorities are consulted), and frequently entertaining, even when discussing a sad and even horrific topic. His larger works may not be to everyone's taste (for topic more than style), but a short work like this one, on an interesting and oft-neglected theme, is a worthwhile read for any student of history. Highly recommended.	2003-05-29

And while I found the Sterns' \\"Blue Willow Inn Cookbook\\" somewhat disappointing (not their fault, I think), this trip to Tucson was much more satisfying. Not Tex-Mex or New Mexico-Mexican, the Sterns classify El Charro Caf&eacute; as \\"Tucson-Mexican,\\" a fascinating and unique blend that makes this \\"Roadfood Cookbook\\" well worth the vicarious trip.<br />Part of the advantage here is that the charro culture celebrated at El Charro Caf&eacute; is much more foreign to most Americans than is the Southern comfort food of the Blue Willow Inn. A good percentage of the value of this book is in introducing that culture to the wider reading public (who knew there was so much history and significance behind the stereotypical black outfits generally associated with mariachi bands?). But there's a lot of value in the delicious-sounding recipes too. Far from the \\"fried and covered in cheese\\" nature of \\"Mexican food\\" as it's often presented to us, these menu items are varied, colorful, and generally pretty healthy.<br />So hit the road again, Stern fans. Grab a tostada grande and a glass of sangria, and let our favorite foodie writers take us on another culinary adventure.	2003-05-27

For people who are already familiar with the case against the Clinton administration made by writers like Barbara Olson, Ann Coulter, or Gary Aldrich, \\"Buzz\\" Patterson's \\"Dereliction of Duty\\" adds few new arguments. He does, however, bring a wealth of corroborative details and an eyewitness account from inside the Clinton White House.<br />This title is really more of an essay than a book-length work. Once you take out the long foreword, three appendices (including a lengthy excerpt from one of Cap Weinberger's books), notes, and index, you've got about 120 pages of widely spaced type. I read most of this on a Memorial Day afternoon, and still had time for yardwork. It would probably have worked as well as a long magazine article, though the fact that it's a book (and a best-selling one, here on Amazon.com) should help give his account the wide distribution it deserves.<br />I suspect that in these post-9/11, post-Iraq War days, Patterson's description of the Clintons', and their administration's, \\"loathing\\" of the military will strike the strongest negative response. Worse even then their systematic, deliberate weakening of the military (as Patterson describes it) was the anti-military attitude that pervaded the White House, from the top down (and apparently including even Chelsea). Uniformed officers and men were routinely abused, sneered at, or ignored, used as caddies or go-fers, or treated as some sort of federal jobs corps that could be better spent \\"doing something\\" like public works projects or caring for the homeless. Patterson concludes Clinton saw international policy, particularly the deployment of the military, entirely through the lens of domestic politics -- what Patterson calls \\"CNN diplomacy.\\" Conservatives, especially, are likely to value Patterson's military background and high value he clearly places on duty, honor, and country.<br />As we get further and blessedly further from the Clinton years, more and more titles are likely to appear showing us that dysfunctional administration from the inside out. While Clinton acolytes like Sid Blumethal will continue to put out their massive, unreadable apologias, men and women like Colonel Patterson will give us the quiet but powerful testimony of their own experience. This isn't a big book. And taken on its own, it's arguably not even an important book. But it is another brick in the massive and growing wall of evidence arising around the historical memory of the Clinton administration.

That makes this book a particularly timely and instructive one.<br />The book's structure has been described in many of these reviews: five biographies, about 40 pages each, and then a longer section weaving together the issues and events of these men's lives into the large drama of the growth of American imperialism. Though the book's length is certainly not unmanageable -- in fact, it would be hard to do this topic justice in a much smaller book -- one drawback of frontloading the biographies is that some of the details of the men's lives tend to be forgotten by the time they reappear later on in the narrative. Mahan, in particular, appears only sporadically in the second half of the book, although his influence on the other men can still be felt.<br />Zimmerman focuses his narrative, obviously, on these five men and their influence on their nation and the world. The author perhaps agrees with Henry Cabot Lodge, whom he quotes on page 184 as writing, \\"The personal qualities and individual abilities of public men ... make the history and determine the fate of nations\\" (ellipses in original). This \\"methodological individualist\\" tack is a refreshing approach in a discipline that these days is so mired in \\"social movements\\" and \\"impersonal forces\\" that the critical -- even indispensable -- roles of individual men and women is often forgotten. While America may yet have become an imperial power without these five men, Zimmerman makes a strong case that Roosevelt, Mahan, Lodge, Root, and Hay, by their own will, channeled America's might and power in the direction of their choosing. It's a direction we're still, by and large, moving today.<br />While the five biographies in the first half of the book are all useful, insightful, and well written, they're really mostly prologue. It's the second half where most of the action, drama, and even excitement can be found. Zimmerman does a fine job of charting the drive for empire, the various obstacles that our five subjects had to overcome, and the long-term consequences of it all.<br />Zimmerman doesn't play favorites. Although his approach to the rise of empire is generally positive, it is balanced and nonjudgmental: his discussion of the annexation of Hawai`i, for example, makes it clear that the coup against the native monarchy was little more than theft. At the same time, though, he does not idealize the pre-colonial era or downplay that monarchy's undeniable corruption. He is clear-eyed about the costs of empire-building, doesn't shy from naming certain American actions in Cuba and the Philippines the \\"atrocities\\" they were, charts successes and failures honestly, and makes painfully clear the disconnect between America's high-minded rhetoric and our often base conduct. In what may be the nearest our author comes to outright denunciation, he is very hard on Theodore Roosevelt's \\"spurious euphoria\\" about the glories of war and TR's general bloodthirstiness (pp. 416-7).<br />I would have liked to see a little more discussion of the opposition to war mounted by the \\"goo-goos,\\" though Zimmerman's discussion, as far as it goes, is sound. This ground has also been covered well by Robert Beisner's \\"Twelve Against Empire\\" (1968), a work I recommend and which is listed in Zimmerman's bibliography.<br />Even today, there seems to be reluctance in some quarters to see the United States as an imperial power. But we became one a century ago, and remain one today. While our intentions, and certainly our rhetoric, may have been (and be) more idealistic than those of other empires, the real-world consequences have been largely the same. As an introduction to how and why the American empire was born, a primer to how we got to where we are today, and a reminder of the power individuals have to shape the world, Zimmerman's \\"First Great Triumph\\" is not to be missed.found.

One of the other reviewers on this page is probably right that most any Southern grandma will already know most of the recipes listed between the covers of this book. But as American food, like the rest of American culture, becomes more monolithic and regional distinctives are paved over, even recipes as generally undistinguished as most of the ones here are, are certainly worth preserving -- especially by fans of the food and culture of the American South.<br />It's true that The Blue Willow Inn isn't on the cutting edge of haute cuisine.  Billie and Louis Van Dyke would never have been invited to compete against Masaharu Morimoto (\\"I summon Iron Chef Southern!\\"). Nevertheless, the restaurant is, to hear the Sterns tell it, immensely popular, proving that there's still a market for sweet potato biscuits, chicken divan, and fried okra, with a big peach cobbler for dessert. Readers browsing this book are much more likely to find things suitable for a church potluck than for an elegant dinner with friends or romantic evening for two (unless your beloved likes Coca-Cola cake with broiled peanut butter frosting). I don't think the word \\"wine\\" appears anywhere in here, though \\"Southern champagne,\\" sweet tea, is the very first recipe.<br />Fans of the Stern's food-writing will find a decent balance here of their commentaries on recipes and a few small articles on aspects of The Blue Willow Inn -- interviews with personnel, a bit of history, a section on rocking chairs, and the like. Even if you never find yourself -- or could never even imagine yourself -- making any of the recipes from this bastion of Southern cookery, I think food fans, or fans of the Sterns, will probably find this a trip worth taking at least once.	2003-05-20

But for some reason, I had never made an effort to track down and read any of the collections of his essays. I see now what a mistake that was. I wish I'd read this back when it was new.<br />It was some consolation to find that the articles and essays here assembled were definitely worth the wait. Reed is a very funny writer, but he's not a &quot;humorist&quot; or humor writer in the sense of, say, Dave Barry or even (to move outside the region) P.J. O'Rourke. You'll definitely get a laugh out of many of these pieces, but you'll also find them deeply informative. Reed is, after all, a serious researcher and thinker, and the two indisputable facts that define his writing  -- that he loves the South, and he *knows* the South -- feed off one another.<br />Granted, many of the essays here are more than a little dated (some date back to the Carter Administration), and I'd love to know how things have changed in the thirteen, fifteen, or almost twenty-five years since some of them were written. But that's no doubt just one more reason to track down Reed's more recent collections.<br />Southerners, including expatriates, will nod knowingly at much of what Reed says, and will get a kick out of seeing themselves depicted so accurately in print. I hope they'll also take to heart his commitment to preserving many of the things -- from culture to accent -- that make the South truly distinctive. Folks from other parts of the country will find that Reed has not only made that sometimes-puzzling region a little easier to understand, but has made the trip a remarkably pleasant one.	2003-05-08

It was history written very much the way I like to read it.<br /><br />Obviously, that's a statement that has a lot to do with personal taste, and I can certainly understand why some reviewers here didn't react to this title in at all the same way. Simon Winchester has not given us a straightforward, journalistic, dispassionate, just-the-facts narrative of a discreet event, in which the mountain explodes on page one and the text ends when the ash stops falling, with an epilogue meditating on the event from the perspective of 120 years later. If that's what you're expecting, or the way your preferences run, you're going to be truly disappointed.<br /><br />No, what Winchester has given us is much more of a narrative in the true sense of \\"story,\\" full of explanation, characterization, interesting asides -- I literally pictured myself sitting by a campfire as Simon the Storyteller wove a great yarn. If you take this book as a story and settle in for it, instead of tapping your feet impatiently and checking your wristwatch, I think you'll get a lot more out of it.<br /><br />In fact, this book reminded me a lot of the books written and TV shows hosted by James Burke (one of which -- coincidentally? -- was titled [[ASIN:B000GRJOV8 The Day The Universe Changed]]). Winchester weaves together history, sociology, geology, physics, biology, and much more. The reader is taken through Dutch colonial administration, the state of nineteenth-century volcanology, the validity of \\"ethogeological prediction,\\" and quite a few other things before the mountain finally gets around to detonating somewhere about page 207. That part of the story, the actual day the world exploded, is told in an excellent chapter titled \\"The Paroxysm, the Flood, and the Crack of Doom.\\"<br /><br />After that, effects are tabulated, lessons are learned, and -- after a quick narrative of the author's own visit to Anak Krakatoa, the \\"son\\" of the original volcano, the book ends.<br /><br />Winchester's style shouldn't distract the reader from the quality of the work he's done. The breadth of the story reveals the breadth of his research. The one area where I thought the research, or at least the presentation of evidence was a little on the thin side, was in the argument that seems to be capturing the most attention from reviewers, namely that the Krakatoa eruption precipitated a growth in Islamic fundamentalism in Indonesia that is still affecting us today. My fear was that this would turn out to be largely a case of the *post hoc* fallacy. Now I'm willing to accept there may be a causal relationship. But I still wish Winchester had buttressed this point more fully.<br /><br />On the other hand, that didn't seem to have as much weight in the book as it's being given in reviews. And on the whole, this is a very good work of both history and storytelling. I thought it was much better *writing* than I've found in the massive tomes of various bestselling \\"popular\\" historians, and much better *history* too.

Even if I never prepared a single recipe out of any of their many titles, I would still value their books and, generally, give them pretty high ratings. In other words, I'm a fan of &quot;food lit.&quot;<br />From that standpoint, this book was a little disappointing, in that it's split fifty-fifty (almost literally, given the fifty states plus D.C.) between recipes and commentary. This utilitarian little guide doesn't have the foodie allure of &quot;Roadfood,&quot; which remains, to this point, my favorite Stern book. I readily admit that for most people, though, and especially for chili-heads who may not necessarily be Stern fans, this title has a lot to offer.<br />Specifically, what it has to offer is chili -- fifty-one recipes ranging from the classic (Massachusetts' Rock-ribbed bean-and-beef chili) to the exotic (Hawaii's Paniolo macadamia nut and chipotle chili) to the, frankly, bizarre (West Virginia's Fried bologna chili). I was expecting Washington to offer some kind of salmon-based chili, and was intrigued to find instead a recipe featuring our other well-known export, coffee. What you won't find is a &quot;basic&quot; chili -- each recipe is an unusual, not to say unique, regional variation on a theme that is left unstated (kind of the &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; of food, I guess).<br />With all this diversity, there's something for every taste, including vegetarians. Even if you're not a chili-head, it's worth the effort to track down this book and give a few of the selections a try.	2003-05-08

This book, first published in 1952 and substantially updated and enlarged after Smith's death in 1971, is, if not the definitive guide to the subject, probably one of the most important.<br />Smith's photography is enhanced by informative chapters, written by Graham Hutton, that trace the evolution of English parish church design and construction from well before the Conquest up to and through the Victorian era. Of course, the story of parish churches is also the story of the parish, and therefore the reader also will find here a fine capsule summary of changing sociological patterns over many centuries.<br />If I have one complaint, it's in the way the text, explanatory notes, and photos are arranged. Hutton's chapters are annotated with references to the photographic plates, which are all generally in one section following the relevant text. The explanatory notes on the photos, in turn, are in a section following the plates. So a reader who wants to look at a photo to which Hutton refers must turn ahead several pages to find the photo, and then several more pages to read, essentially, the caption to the photo. In all, it makes for a lot of flipping pages back and forth and a less than entirely efficient reading experience.<br />Apart from that, though, this title should have a lot of appeal, not just to architecture and art historians, but also to the not-insubstantial number of people who have affection for historic churches, the English countryside, and the preservation of both. There is much here to learn from, and enjoy.	2003-05-08

But clich&eacute;s get to be such generally because there's truth to them, and that's definitely the case here. If Thomas Jefferson was one of the most interesting figures in American history (and I think that's unquestionably true), then Monticello may well be one of America's most interesting houses. And for this colorful book produced by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, we are guided through the house and grounds by people who know their stuff.<br />Specifically, the chapters of this title are written by Monticello's director of restoration, the curator, the director of gardens and grounds, and other experts associated with the Foundation. Large, colorful photos are accompanied by informed commentary and all the requisite history, as well as documentation of the decades of restoration work it has taken to get the house and grounds to its current condition. A book doesn't make up for a visit in person  -- if anything, I wished for more photos of the interior, especially of the book room and &quot;cabinet.&quot; But for a general overview of the house, grounds, and collection, and an insight into the man himself, this book is hard to beat. I recommend it as a souvenir, as well as a nice companion to a Jefferson biography.	2003-05-02

But for summarizing the things a man shouldn't do, getting him to actually start thinking about style, or saying things that really need to be said (\\"No level of fitness justifies wearing a tank top in public\\" [p. 80].), this little guide is a pretty good way to get started.<br /><br />Perhaps in keeping with the entertaining bulldog photos that break up the text, some of the declarations are somewhat too dogmatic: No cowboy boots, no Hawaiian shirts, no pleated khakis. In fact, there's some room for discussion on most of these issues (what if you live in Hawaii?). But frankly, so many men need so much help dressing properly that if they need absolute rules to live by, so be it.<br /><br />On the whole, this is a very entertaining little book. If men turn to magazines like [[ASIN:B000LXHJFK Esquire (2-year)]] for their style guidance, then I wish a handy primer like this one all success in imparting a few guiding principles. But the most useful principle of all may be the one they print about a dozen pages from the end: \\"Never trust a fashion magazine.\\"	2003-05-02

Brooke de Ocampo has hied herself to London and produced a book that does for the brilliant, educated, and exceptionally wealthy young elite of that city what her earlier title did for their counterparts in New York. The difference this time, unfortunately, is that she decided to let other Bright Young Things do the writing as well as open their homes and pose for photographs. And so while the writing in the original BYT was relatively unobjectionable celebrity journalism, a good deal of the writing in BYT London doesn't even rise to that level. On the other hand, the introduction by Nicholas Coleridge runs rings around its BYT counterpart by William Norwich, if only because it's so much less gushing in its praise for the people being profiled.<br />Apart from the writing, though, this book is a lot like the first one. Beautiful people, beautiful homes, beautiful children, beautiful photos. The selection of people covered seems, if anything, slightly broader than that in BYT. Whatever your reaction to the first book, I imagine it'll be about the same to this one ... unless, perhaps, you happen to be, or be related to, one of the people featured in it.	2003-04-28

If beautiful people in New York City want to create a volume in which they can feature other beautiful people, their beautiful homes and beautiful families, and write glowingly about the beautiful lives they lead, and then sell it to themselves, the envious, and the just plain nosy, who am I to complain?<br />Far more risible is the introduction by William Norwich, in which &quot;these meritocrats -- don't call them aristocrats&quot; are painted not only as the apotheosis of style, but also of social concern, enlightened world view, forward-looking design, and folks-next-door approachability.  In fact, three quarters of these &quot;meritocrats&quot; I'd never heard of before ... and most of those whose names I recognized (Guinness, Lauder, Herrera, another Lauder, Von Furstenburg [and one of the Miller sisters], Herm&egrave;s, etc.) came more from their families' prosperity and fame than from the meritocratic achievements of the individuals themselves.<br />Still, the pictures are pretty enough, and the writing (apart from Norwich's) unobjectionable. And maybe it wasn't the subjects' fault they showed up in this embarrassing book. If one of my friends called up and said she was assembling a picture book of obscure Seattle book reviewers and wanted me in it, I might oblige her just out of friendship. But I'd make sure not to leave my copy sitting around where visitors could see it.<br />In all, this title has a certain voyeuristic value, from the pre-September 11 era. But I hope those of us outside the rarified little world of New York Society don't take it for a lot more than that.	2003-04-28

The other two Penguin Lives titles I've read so far -- Paul Johnson on Napoleon and John Keegan on Churchill -- both did excellent jobs of explaining their subjects' lives by drawing out instructive themes from those lives and assessing their subjects' impact on history. Louis Auchincloss, sadly, doesn't do that with Woodrow Wilson.<br />The basic biographical framework -- the &quot;what&quot; -- of this book isn't bad, and certainly Auchincloss is a fine writer. But while the facts of Wilson's life are presented effectively, they're not tied together with any kind of larger thesis. Auchincloss develops a few recurring ideas -- Wilson's friendship with Colonel House, the theory of &quot;the two Wilsons,&quot; the influence of Wilson's second wife, the rivalry with Henry Cabot Lodge -- but none of them seem like more than convenient narrative hooks. Which, if any, is a key to the man's character?<br />What I found most bothersome is that Auchincloss's biography ends (literally) with Wilson's last word. Remarkably -- for a biography of one of the world's most influential figures in the first half of the century, and a man who is considered by some (justly, in my opinion) to bear a large share of responsibility for the ultimate onset of World War Two -- there is virtually no attempt to place Wilson into his historical context, to measure the long-term impact of his life, or to judge his successes and failures in the considered light of history. It's like Auchincloss bumped up against the Penguin Lives word-count limit and decided just to stop.<br />Coming off the fine Churchill and Napoleon volumes, I was really hoping for more here -- especially from a writer with such a high reputation. This title is a decent summary of the facts of Wilson's life, but the interested reader will have to go someplace else to put it all in context.l in context.	2003-04-24

And while Flusser's book was very influential on my then-developing sense of dress and style, the impact of Wagenvoord's book was much more limited and fleeting.<br />This is interesting, because &quot;Personal Style&quot; sets out to cover an awful lot of ground, broadly but not especially deeply -- not only principles of men's clothing, but also issues of hygiene, diet and exercise, how to iron a shirt or pack a jacket into a suitcase without getting it all wrinkled, how to host a dinner party at home or order with confidence from a restaurant menu, and quite a lot more. The key to developing a distinctive personal style, he argues, is simply to feel comfortable about yourself, take good care of yourself and your possessions, and know how to handle yourself in a variety of situations. Nothing really all that complex.<br />The book is a decent guide for what it sets out to do. But there's another element to it as well. It's a commercial for Grey Flannel.<br />This title must have been commissioned by Geoffrey Beene, because not only does the man himself provide the introduction and the back-cover blurb, but the section on grooming, especially, is liberally illustrated with drawings of Grey Flannel products: deodorant, aftershave, shampoo, soap-on-a-rope, and so on. To its credit, the copy itself doesn't flog Grey Flannel. But the line's presence is still rather obvious. If this isn't a problem for you, you may well find some things in here moderately useful.	2003-04-18

But I can say that I'm definitely looking forward to reading them.<br />Gene Logsdon is, in his way, just as \\"revisionist\\" as many of the historians I've found myself reading lately. He challenges many of the orthodoxies of the \\"farm crisis\\" we city folk have been hearing about for decades, arguing that in fact most of the farms succumbing to economic pressure are large-scale \\"factory farms\\" that have been uneconomically overextended from the very beginning. Small, family-owned farms that resist the lure of going into debt to purchase more land, more chemicals, and more expensive machinery tend, he argues, to do just fine. Logsdon's prime example of this is the Amish farms of his native Ohio, whose owners have grown positively rich (especially by their own standards) by keeping their farms to manageable size.<br />Another of Logsdon's key points, especially worth thinking about, concerns the misleading nature of economic calculation as it is frequently applied to farming. Is raising livestock, as well as crops, and using the manure to fertilize your fields a cost, or a cost-savings, relative to using expensive chemicals? What is the value of working with your family on a small farm versus hiring hands to work a larger one? Logsdon raises many questions about \\"cost\\" versus \\"value\\" that are worth contemplating, even by those of us in the suburbs.<br />The book begins with contrary, sometimes (by his own admission) angry essays about the economics of farming and the general uselessness of university agricultural-education programs. But they soon transition into portrayals of farming life that are both idyllic (in the original sense) and subtly instructive. The three closing essays (\\"closing\\" in this edition; they're toward the middle in \\"Living at Nature's Pace\\"), \\"A Woodcutter's Pleasures,\\" \\"The Pond at the Center of the Universe,\\" and \\"My Wilderness,\\" are all deeply moving.<br />This was my first exposure to Gene Logsdon's work, but it definitely won't be my last. I'm planning on tracking down his many other titles as well. As a third (or more) generation child of the suburbs, my connection to the farm is somewhat attenuated. But Logsdon's writing makes me feel closer to it nonetheless, and it's a feeling I find myself really appreciating.ree closing essays (\\"closing\\" in this edition; they're toward the middle in \\"Living at Nature's Pace\\"), \\"A Woodcutter's Pleasures,\\" \\"The Pond at the Center of the Universe,\\" and \\"My Wilderness,\\" are all deeply moving.<br />This was my first exposure to Gene Logsdon's work, but it definitely won't be my last.

While this book is necessarily less comprehensive (and less easily searched and updated) than the online version, it's still an interesting and informative browse-through for Emerald City residents and a good introduction to the greater wealth on their web site.<br />This small title's pages are packed with colorful illustrations and punchy copy. It probably works better to open and read it at random than to try to follow it systematically from page to page, because while it's basically organized chronologically, there are so many sections, subheads, and sidebars -- plus the timeline itself on nearly every page -- that trying to keep it all straight could get maddening. It's much more fun simply to open a page and read about why Seattle's streets aren't aligned north and south of Yesler Way, what happened to the communities known as Squack and Slaughter (they're still here, under different names) and why there were as many arguments about light rail 50 years ago as there are today.<br />On the whole, any Washington resident with an interest in this city would probably find something entertaining or worthwhile to justify browsing this title. Gene Logsdon writes that one of the ways to avoid provincialism is to know your own province really well. This book is one useful way for Seattleites to do that.	2003-04-18

It really defined my sense of classic men's style, and gave me an appreciation, previously lacking, for -- and an ability to recognize -- a truly well-dressed man.<br />Alan Flusser, a dandy to the core, makes a great case for his argument that men's style (as distinct from &quot;men's fashion&quot; -- yuck) changes little over the decades. The &quot;look&quot; that worked for Fred Astaire or Cary Grant still works today. Tab collars, rounded collars, suspenders, monk straps, French cuffs, handkerchiefs (aka &quot;pocket squares&quot;) no tassel loafers with suits! ... the man who absorbs &quot;the principles of fine men's dress&quot; presented here will be well armed to do battle with a world where &quot;dressing down&quot; has become the sad and sorry norm.<br />If, as Oscar Wilde said, &quot;A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life,&quot; Alan Flusser will help you take a great many paces down that road. Take that step now! It may even change your life too.	2003-04-18

A fine researcher and writer, Paul C. Nagel has succeeded in doing what I believe is the key thing in an autobiography: really taking the reader inside his subject's mind and emotions, telling us not only what he did, but why.<br />The key to this success is Nagel's access to JQA's unexpurgated diary, a treasure-trove of information not available to earlier writers. (As Nagel notes in his introduction, this book \\"is, to my knowledge, the first biography that draws upon Adams' massive manuscript diary.\\") Fortunately, Adams was a compulsive and comprehensive diarist, and so we get a look at our subject in a way few biographies offer us of any person. In a sense, JQA's interior monologue is our constant companion.<br />To be honest, though, I think that's also this title's major weakness. Nagel is so focused on Adams' own self-analysis that the book sometimes struck me as too introverted. We seldom encounter other people's assessment of Adams, just his view of them, or his opinion of their opinion of him. The many significant events of Adams' life, too, are frequently viewed through Adams' eyes and colored by his reaction to them. This isn't to say that Nagel isn't an objective biographer, but rather that the book could have benefited from an occasional contrasting viewpoint.<br />Though that weakness might be seen by some as a major lapse, I should repeat that I nevertheless found this an interesting read and an insightful biography.  Nagel captures the motivations, passions, and fears behind JQA's notoriously prickly demeanor, and is honest about his subject's strengths and weaknesses and why he was, at various points in his own lifetime, both deeply unpopular and widely admired.<br />JQA's life, like that of Herbert Hoover, teaches the important lesson that achieving the presidency isn't necessarily a person's crowning achievement, nor the stage on which he makes his most lasting impact, for good or ill, on his nation and world. In Adams' case, two of his most significant accomplishments bear other men's names: the Monroe Doctrine and the Smithsonian Institution. He is still a useful study in our era, and Nagel's biography, while not perhaps definitive on JQA's public impact, is the gold standard for assessing his rich, and extremely important, inner life.Adams' case, two of his most significant accomplishments bear other men's names: the Monroe Doctrine and the Smithsonian Institution.

From politicians to talk radio, the metaphors of \\"appeasement\\" and \\"avoiding another Vietnam\\" loom large in the debate over Iraq. I would suggest that this title be made required reading for anyone who dares send those metaphors into battle.<br />Record argues that Munich and Vietnam have been the dominant historical memes in White Houses deciding whether or not to employ American power around the world. For better or worse, what various Presidents and their advisors have taken to be \\"the lessons of Munich\\" and/or \\"the lessons of Vietnam\\" have been important, sometimes deciding, factors. Not surprisingly, Record finds that those \\"lessons\\" have often been misinterpreted and mis-applied by our political leaders, many times with serious consequences.<br />While this book is especially useful for anyone in, or who fancies themselves someday being in, a position of political influence, Record's work is also valuable reading for the rest of us. That's because he also analyzes how those same historical memes have been used by Presidents and their spokesmen to justify particular courses of action to the American people. It's important that we be able to recognize when that's being done, and equipped to decide whether the metaphor is valid. This title is a very useful tool in that process.<br />Duff Cooper, a British politician and contemporary of Winston Churchill, once wrote that one of the problems with democracy is that too few democratic leaders read history. The corollary of that, Record might argue, is that even the ones who have read history are apt to misinterpret it, or color their interpretations to justify actions they have already decided are desirable. An attractive metaphor can exert powerful force on decision-makers. Few things are more seductive ... or potentially more dangerous. Jeffrey Record is to be commended for helping the reader see though the seductiveness and apply the cold light of logical thought.more dangerous.

However, while their political success was small, the ripples of their intellectual impact continue to be felt today. And so while parts of this book, one of the most articulate presentations of the agrarian position, are somewhat dated, there's still a lot of value for modern readers.<br />The book got off to a slow start for me. Davidson's presentation of the theory and history of American regionalism, in a section titled \\"The Nation We Are,\\" is important, but much of it summarizes, or reacts to, the work of historians and sociologists now even more obscure than the Agrarians themselves (Frederick Jackson Turner being a notable exception). While Davidson makes important points about the endogenous or organic nature of regions, regional characteristics, and regional loyalties -- in distinction to the imposed, artificial, and largely arbitrary nature of political divisions like counties or states -- his focus on the social science of the 1930s is not a terrifically compelling read today.<br />Once we get past that first section, though, the reading is much, much more rewarding. This is particularly true of the second section, titled \\"Immovable Bodies and Irresistible Forces,\\" which focuses on defining the characteristics of various American regions and the people who live there. I especially enjoyed \\"Still Rebels, Still Yankees,\\" which contrasts Brother Jonathan of Yankeetown, Vermont, with Cousin Roderick of Rebelville, Georgia. \\"The Two Old Wests,\\" an exploration of how frontier, geographic, and cultural influences blended, with very different results, in the Old Southwest (Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and later Texas) and Old Northwest (Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and other parts of the modern \\"Midwest\\"), was fascinating.  And \\"The Great Plains,\\" a pr&eacute;cis of Walter Prescott Webb's important book of the same title with Davidson's own expanded commentary, extends the analysis to the foothills of the Rockies. As a Seattleite, I would have liked to have seen Davidson carry his discussion all the way to the Pacific coast, but I can't complain about what he did do.<br />Entertaining and valuable as all this is, the most useful section for modern students of politics and regionalism might be the chapter titled \\"Expedients vs. Principles -- Cross-Purposes in the South.\\" Davidson here makes a number of important, and still timely, points, including illustrating how attacks on the \\"backward\\" South are frequently Trojan horses for the imposition of another, usually Northeastern, political or social agenda. The author also argues, contra those who say the Constitution and federalist system are outdated because \\"the Founders couldn't foresee\\" the nature of modern society, that indeed, Jefferson and his contemporaries did foresee the coming of large-scale industrialism and the destructive effects it would have on agrarian society.<br />Reading Davidson today, one can't help but wonder whether things are much worse, or perhaps a little better, than during his day. One the one hand, monopoly industrialism has in some senses given way to the \\"new economy\\" driven by high technology. On the other hand, American culture is more monolithic than ever, thanks to mass media and popular culture that are far more pervasive and homogenizing than in the '30s. Are there any discernable differences between Brother Jonathan's and Cousin Roderick's twenty-first century great-grandchildren? It's a question worth investigating, and Davidson's insights are as valuable and provocative today as they were nearly 70 years ago.t book of the same title with Davidson's own expanded commentary, extends the analysis to the foothills of the Rockies.

The long-term impact of war on government and society is a topic that should be top-of-mind for all Americans right now. And I can think of few better places to begin contemplating that impact, and related questions, than the outstanding collection of essays assembled under the title &quot;The Costs of War.&quot;<br />Like two other books that grew out of conferences hosted by the Mises Institute -- &quot;Secession, State, and Liberty&quot; (1998) and &quot;Reassessing the Presidency&quot; (2001) -- these essays are uniformly challenging, thought-provoking, and unashamedly &quot;revisionist&quot; ... which is to say, they question the accepted thinking of both liberal and conservative received wisdom. While all twenty contributions are worthwhile, I personally found three of them particularly rewarding: Joseph Stromberg's piece on the Spanish-American War and two essays by Ralph Raico, &quot;World War I: The Turning Point&quot; and &quot;Rethinking Churchill.&quot; As a long-time student of Winston Churchill, I particularly recommend the latter. Far more than other so-called revisionists like Irving or Charmley, Raico's piece in &quot;The Costs of War&quot; raises questions that any intellectually-honest student or fan of WSC absolutely must confront.<br />Though I found those three essays particularly good, it's hard not to single out others as well. Murray Rothbard's two essays -- his important &quot;America's Two Just Wars&quot; and a reprint of his classic &quot;World War I as Fulfillment&quot; -- are, of course, up to the author's always-high standards. Justin Raimondo's chapter on the history of the anti-war Right highlights a theme he's been emphasizing again in recent months. As a former navy dependent, I was fascinated by Allan Carlson's survey of &quot;The Military as an Engine of Social Change.&quot; And this weekend, it was more than a little surreal to look up from Eugene Sledge's memoirs of his World War II combat service, or Paul Fussell's meditation on &quot;The Culture of War,&quot; to see the new Iraq war unfolding in real-time on my television.<br />Each of these essays gives the reader much to think about. But there's another thing I should warn about. As with the two other books I mentioned before, this title points the reader to many, many other books worth hunting down and reading. Mises Institute authors tend (to their credit) to love their footnotes, and I would bet reading &quot;The Costs of War&quot; has revealed at least three dozen more books on related topics I'll need to add to my must-find-time-to-read list.<br />Unabashedly pro-freedom, this book will open the reader's eyes to elements of history and political science she may well never have confronted before. And even if you already are a confirmed member of the Mises-Rothbard school of thought, the ideas, arguments, and points of scholarship contained here will stretch your intellectual muscles and arm you for future study and debate.

This book is a fine collection of some of the Sterns' most distinctive and interesting roadside restaurant experiences, along with a memorable recipe (or facsimile of one) from each. Sadly, some of the restaurants discussed here are no longer in business, but the Sterns help keep them living in memory.<br />Personally, I found this title less evocative than &quot;Roadfood.&quot; That book made me want to toss a copy of it in the glove compartment and head out on a cross-country tour, hitting one great-sounding diner or rib shack after another. This book didn't. It was nice to read about the Sterns' experiences in their travels, but I didn't catch the passion of it all like I did with &quot;Roadfood.&quot; Your mileage may vary.<br />Still, if you're a fan of the Sterns, this is a title worth checking out -- not, perhaps, as a guide to your own future travels, but as a good example of &quot;foodie lit&quot; and the vicarious excitement of sitting down and studying a never-before-seen menu.	2003-03-21

What makes this book different from his similar titles about Army and Air Force units, as he notes early on, is that whereas technology is a key element in defining the armored cav unit or air wing, the principle distinctive for the Marine Corps is the Marine ethos and, therefore, the Marines themselves. Clancy does a fine job in capturing what makes the USMC unique among American, and indeed the world's, military forces.<br />Liking or disliking Clancy's writing is largely a matter of taste. Though I generally find him informative and reasonably insightful, he does tend to go on. Though \\"Marine\\" is relatively more compact than some other of his titles, here too I occasionally found myself skimming over long sections on training or, especially, the various weapons and other \\"tools of the trade\\" the Corps uses. Other people might find these the highlight of the book, though. To each his own.<br />On the whole, this book is a fine overview, not only of what a MEU (SOC) is and how it operates, but the larger issue of why we have a Corps and what makes it distinctive. As some of the reviews on this page indicate, the Corps is the only American military force that continually has to justify (to some) its existence. This book, like Victor Krulak's \\"First to Fight\\" (USNI Press, 1984), helps do that. It would also be a very valuable read for someone considering becoming a Marine, or for family members and friends wondering what their Marine has gone through, and why. This book may not be for everyone, but Clancy fans will definitely enjoy it, and interested readers will probably get a lot out of it.	2003-03-18

But while his earlier book with Chuck Horner, \\"Every Man a Tiger,\\" was described to me as one of the best looks yet at air combat in the (first) Gulf War, this title struck me as much longer than it needed to be and at times more than a little dull.<br />Like Clancy's other \\"Commanders\\" co-authors, General Carl Stiner is a fascinating guy with a lot of interesting stories to tell (or, at least, stories that would probably be interesting to typical Tom Clancy readers). In this book, however, his autobiography is combined with a history of the US Army special operations units (the subtitle of this book is \\"Inside the Special Forces,\\" but this book is mostly an Army affair), a look at modern Special Forces tools and training, and more. The level of detail is frequently numbing, and I often found myself skimming, or skipping entire pages to get to the end of the story being told.<br />Readers looking to get a better understanding of how special forces units operate, while still getting a good dose of Clancy's military-techno prose would probably do better to star with his \\"Guided Tour\\" book \\"Special Forces.\\" Then, if you're really into true-life stories and even greater detail, come to this title. But if you're not interested in, or ready for, nearly six hundred pages of reminiscences, you can probably do without it.	2003-03-18

A veteran of many of the roads and roadside stops pictured here, Hollis has a real feel ... and a real affection ... for his topic. In these hip days, when so many writers feel the need to ridicule or treat with arched eyebrow anything less sophisticated and post-modern than *right now,* it's very pleasant to read a book about popular culture and &quot;commercial archaeology&quot; that's not encrusted in irony.<br />This book is also a celebration of Southern culture, especially that part of Southern culture that developed in order to separate visiting Yankees from their money. For, as Hollis notes, it was the arrival in the South of northern vacationers seeking warmer weather that prompted the birth and growth of the attractions listed here. It also promoted a number of important, and lasting, businesses. Among the companies born in the South to capitalize on the tourist trade, KFC (of course), Popeye's Chicken, Long John Silver, Red Lobster, Burger King, Hardee's, and Holiday Inn are just some of the more recognizable names.<br />From water parks to Wild West shows, Cypress Gardens to Stone Mountain, Dogpatch USA and the Grand Ole Opry to Stuckey's and countless attractions now nearly forgotten, this book is a great nostalgia ride through a largely vanished time. If you were fortunate enough to have seen that time, this book may bring back some happy memories. And if this is your first time through you may find yourself wondering what you're missing as you cruise in air-conditioned comfort on the soulless interstate.	2003-03-14

And while much of the expertise that breeds success comes only through experience, reading this classic guide can help you build a solid foundation.<br />Throckmorton lays out the essential qualities for a successful direct marketer, a person who is, she argues, a combination of technician, artist, salesperson, writer, and actor. These depend on deep and powerful reserves of curiosity, imagination, and a willingness to learn. She then walks the reader through the basics of isolating an offer, developing creative concepts, executing those concepts in copy and art, and measuring results. Though much of her focus is on direct mail, she also discusses direct-response space and broadcast ads (because of the age of this title, there's nothing in here about online marketing, though of course many of the principles are the same).<br />I strongly recommend that any direct-response creative or client-services person keep this book handy ... and that it also be read by anyone on the client side who is, or might ever be, using direct-response marketing in their business. It's easy to do DM badly. Doing it well -- and recognizing *why* good DM is good -- is much more complex. Joan Throckmorton is an excellent guide.	2003-03-13

Frimbo: World's Greatest Railroad Buff	Books	5	7	9	N	N	&quot;Get on a train!&quot;	The old nostalgic ways of travel -- railroad trains and ocean liners -- have a romance to them that cars and airplanes just can't match. Rogers E.M. Whitaker, the man behind the pseudonymous E.M. Frimbo, and his sometime collaborator, Tony Hiss, capture some of that romance and interest in these essays by and about the world's greatest railroad buff. Detailing some of Whitaker/Frimbo's great train experiences from the '30s to the '70s, and recapturing the all-but-vanished world of life on the rails, the pieces gathered here make for fascinating and evocative reading.<br />As with any collection of essays, some of the chapters here are better than others. And generally, I found the chapters added to this &quot;greatly expanded edition&quot; to be less satisfying than the earlier ones, though the obituary of Whitaker and the long closing piece, &quot;Frimbo's Peak,&quot; were both rather moving. Much of Tony Hiss's preface I could likewise have done without. His predictions for the revival of government-funded passenger rail in the early years of the twenty-first century seem, fortunately, not yet to be coming to pass. But then, it wouldn't be the first time a Hiss was on the wrong side of history.<br />But don't let the preface distract you. The essays themselves are by and large great reading, and have me hoping to hop a train before too much longer myself. Whether you're an inveterate train buff, a long-time Frimbo fan, or just a fan of great travel writing, I recommend grabbing this book and taking to the rails, if only in your mind.	2003-03-13

Hopefully, it will be utilized to put an end to grammatical and usage errors, as well as misuse of apostrophe's, \\"quotation marks\\" and other punctuation.<br /><br />If that paragraph above does not give you the dry heaves, you need to read Bill Bryson's \\"Dictionary.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, much as I enjoyed this book, I'm afraid it will appeal primarily to people who already know a lot of this information, instead of to the many who would benefit from reading it. And that's too bad (\\"The belief that *and* should not be used to begin a sentence is without foundation. And that's all there is to it.\\" [p. 13]).<br /><br />As Bryson notes, this book is not a style or usage guide. For that, I would recommend Fowler and Wallraff, sources Bryson often cites, and especially Bill Walsh's [[ASIN:0809225352 Lapsing Into a Comma : A Curmudgeon's Guide to the Many Things That Can Go Wrong in Print--and How to Avoid Them]]. What this book does provide is a useful guide to clarity of expression through precise use of language. While many people may not know, or care, about the distinctions between \\"lectern,\\" \\"podium,\\" \\"dais,\\" and \\"rostrum\\" (p. 119), for example, the distinctions are nevertheless important, and Bryson helps nail them down.<br /><br />He makes the important point that English is a language without a governing authority. Tradition and usage define what's proper. Language is evolutionary -- an example, as Hayek noted, of spontaneous order. However, it's possible to take this idea too far. In the Introduction (a passage quoted on the back cover as well), Bryson says, \\"If you wish to say 'between you and I' or to use *fulsome* in the sense of lavish, it is your privilege to do so...\\". I'm not certain this is the sort of advice people necessarily need to hear, unless of course you add the important corollary that the rest of us have the privilege of considering you an idiot for doing so.<br /><br />Apart from that, though, this is an entertaining as well as useful read, and one I encourage writers both professional and casual to keep handy.is an entertaining as well as useful read, and one I encourage writers both professional and casual to keep handy.	2003-03-06

Maybe this is a decent book for introducing elementary or junior-high school students to the idea of attending the US Military Academy, but I can't imagine they'd find it a very satisfying title. The information is only of the most superficial kind -- for example, that cadets wear uniforms, march on Saturdays, get up early, and have to memorize a lot of things. There's also a focus on minutia like the derivation of \\"plebe,\\" or why second classmen are called \\"Cows\\" (an explanation, by the way, that doesn't match what I've read in most other books about the USMA).<br />Other reviewers have noted several problems with inaccurate or mis-captioned photos. One I found has a caption discussing \\"summer school for yearlings\\" beneath a photo showing professional enlisted soldiers (one clearly has SP4 insignia on his helmet, and both soldiers have mustaches, which are forbidden for cadets). Another shows cadets on parade. The caption ends, \\"This uniform is called Full Dress Gray over White,\\" although that's not the uniform being shown.<br />Similar problems extend into the text itself, with a number of cases where the information is, if not outright wrong, at least misleading. The school is several times referred to as \\"West Point Military Academy,\\" which is not its name, while copy and an accompanying illustration on page 16 leave the impression that battalions and regiments are subdivisions of cadet companies, and not the other way around. General Patton is described as \\"commanding general of the U.S. army from 1942 to 1944,\\" and \\"the Long Gray Line\\" is given as a nickname for the USMA itself, not the body of current and former West Point cadets.<br />These errors and points of confusion may not matter much to the young student trying to decide if he or she is interested in a military education. But they do suggest that the author and editors should have put a little more time into making sure they got their story right. It's disrespectful to the readers, as well as to the subject, to assume they're not worth the effort.ubject, to assume they're not worth the effort.	2003-02-20

Instead, I got drawn into a book that, while relatively long (about 350 pages), was still intelligible, and enjoyable both in small doses and in longer, more concentrated, readings.<br />Murphy divides his epic, sensibly, into 52 week-long essays. The films he sees that week inform the topic of his essays, but seldom *are* the topic. Instead, we get interesting, and highly personal, looks at all different aspects of the filmgoing experience, ranging from travelogues to Italy, Finland, or Australia, to a few hours working at a multiplex theater, to meditations on genres like kung fu, fantasy, or horror films. There are also insightful and well-informed meditations on the state of American filmgoing, the impact of the multiplex and the near-demise of arthouse cinemas, and a useful chapter on the difference between film reviewers and film critics. There's an awful lot in this book, and it's nearly all good stuff.<br />Kevin Murphy clearly knows and loves films, and he is a fine writer. A comparison with the two books by his former MST3K colleague Michael J. Nelson (who makes a brief cameo in this book) might be in order: I found both of Mike's books really funny, but frankly haven't found myself in a big hurry (yet?) to go back and re-read them. Kevin's, on the other hand, isn't intentionally funny &quot;humor writing,&quot; but still has a lot of entertaining stories, asides, and turns of phrases. And I could see myself re-reading it a lot more easily.<br />I waited impatiently to get a copy of this book (in part -- I'm obliged to say it -- because I loved Tom Servo), and it definitely paid off the wait. Film fans and MST fans both will, I think, come to the same conclusion.	2003-02-06

But unlike other Southern writers who made Davis a larger-than-life hero of the Lost Cause, Tate pulls no punches in his assessment of the President's weaknesses as well as his strengths, and how they may have crippled the Confederacy from the very beginning.<br />Tate considers Davis a man of high ideals and great personal honor. At the same time, though, he had a &quot;peculiarly inflexible mind&quot; (&quot;he had not learned anything since about 1843&quot;) (p. 197) and a &quot;feeble grasp of human nature&quot; (p. 255). He treated his office as a sort of super-minister of defense, and was never &quot;the leader of the Southern people as a whole&quot; (p. 180). The South could have won the war if she had had the right kind of political leader, Tate argues. But Davis, whose rise to leadership was generally unearned (p. 79), wasn't it.<br />Beyond Davis the man, Tate also has a deep grasp of the Southern culture and the larger historical and cultural issues that were clashing in the War Between the States. In keeping with his Southern Agrarianism, Tate paints the South as the last outpost of European culture in the Americas, standing against -- and ultimately overwhelmed by -- the surging might of restless, expansionist, wealth-seeking &quot;Americanism,&quot; embodied in the Yankee Northeast. Tate's grasp of Southern regionalism lets him place an emphasis on the tensions between Upper and Lower South that, for me, shone a light on the instability of the Confederate government that I haven't seen as emphasized elsewhere.<br />Tate's perspective and narrative form may not be in keeping with more modern styles of biography. But this book is nevertheless an excellent and insightful read, and I recommend it to any student of the men caught up in, as well as the issues behind, America's bloodiest conflict.men caught up in, as well as the issues behind, America's bloodiest conflict.	2003-01-31

Instead, his gig is explaining the science behind how cooking operates. That explains why this book, unusually among food titles, is divided up based on the type of cooking involved (searing, grilling, roasting, frying are the first four chapters) instead of meal or food varieties.<br />Brown's book is an interesting read if you want to know what happens on a subatomic level when you slap a piece of beef on the barbie. But unlike science texts, or even more intellectual books like Robert Wolke's &quot;What Einstein Told His Cook&quot; (Norton, 2002), Brown's determined to make it entertaining as well as informative. As anyone who's ever seen him wielding fire on his TV show can tell you, Alton Brown likes to play with his food. And so while the relentlessly chatty and informal tone can get a little tiring at times, I have to admit that the chart explaining types of fats (little women holding shopping bags or dead rats) made me laugh out loud.<br />Brown would argue, and I'd agree, that being a great cook -- professionally or in your own home -- not just requires knowing *how* to cook, but also *why* different processes work as they do, and how to get the best results out of each method. You may not need all the information in here if you just want to make an impressive meal. But if you really want to be a kitchen ninja, and feel as comfortable there as a great mechanic does in his garage, these are the kinds of things you ought to understand.<br />By the way, my lovely bride tried out Alton's hard-cooked eggs recipe (pp. 226-7) and it worked like a charm.

I was really looking forward to this biography, and by and large my hopes were rewarded. Like many people, I knew Mencken primarily as the source of countless great one-liner denunciations of government, Puritans, and other fools. Thanks to Terry Teachout's research, understanding, and very readable prose, I know HLM much better now.<br />Teachout's presentation is comprehensive and largely balanced. We get a lot about HLM's politics, of course, but also a clear explanation of his impact on America's literary world and the ways he not only helped shepherd into existence a truly American vernacular in fiction and journalism, but also advanced the careers of promising African American writers like George Schuyler (p. 202-3). Mencken the man comes through clearly as well, as an esthete under his hard-bitten exterior, a lover of art and music -- at least within the rigid bounds of what he considered worthwhile.<br />One area I think Teachout's analysis is a bit incomplete, however, is in his discussion of whether or not Mencken can justly be considered a libertarian. Teachout says no, based mainly on HLM's own declarations that he was not a &quot;liberal&quot; (i.e., &quot;classical liberal&quot; in the modern parlance, or libertarian), did not believe in &quot;forcing&quot; freedom upon others, and his admiration for Wilhelmine Germany before, and even during, World War I (p. 126). At the same time, however, the &quot;American Mercury,&quot; HLM's one-man show (p. 205), explicitly called for &quot;articles on some social problem treated from [the] liberal viewpoint&quot; (p. 256). And as Murray Rothbard, founding father of modern libertarianism, pointed out in a 1962 article titled &quot;H.L. Mencken: The Joyous Libertarian,&quot; the vast assortment of quotes &quot;from highly individualist or anarchist sources&quot; in HLM's &quot;New Dictionary of Quotations&quot; (1942) would strongly indicate that Mencken was not only familiar with, but indeed highly sympathetic to, such writers.<br />As Teachout notes, Mencken wasn't a philosopher, and never articulated a comprehensive political worldview. The important thing, as this book makes very clear, is that Mencken had a passionate, unbending devotion to individual liberty and an undying hostility to those who for whatever motives seek to control others' lives or limit their freedom. If that's not &quot;libertarian,&quot; it's close enough to it for my purposes.<br />On the whole, this biography does much to rescue from gathering oblivion the reputation and importance of a man whose contributions -- to letters as much as, or more than, politics -- deserve to be remembered and honored. Teachout doesn't shy away from difficult topics like HLM's arguable anti-Semitism, his sometimes heartless treatment of former friends and colleagues, or the contradictions between his public face and his private life. But the book as a whole gives us a complete enough portrait of the man that it's easier to put those failings in context and draw our own conclusions.

Anyone who's read other Reeman books will find these types immediately recognizable. What makes &quot;The Greatest Enemy&quot; different from any of the other dozen or so Reeman titles I've read is that this one isn't set during World War II. Instead, it's a contemporary story (contemporary to when Reeman wrote it, that is, in 1970). And so whereas the other titles led to the inevitable climactic clash with German or Japanese forces, it's not clear, for most of this novel, who the enemy is ... or indeed, whether an enemy truly exists at all.<br />Because of the setting, there are fewer instances of combat in this novel than in most of the others -- although the climax, when it comes, makes up for the dearth. In place of the combat, there's a real psychological tension -- mostly surrounding the captain and his state of mind -- that reminded me at times of &quot;The Caine Mutiny.&quot; A good part of the book's midsection is taken up by a harrowing description of the ship's voyage through a fierce and destructive typhoon.<br />As I said, the main characters are very similar to ones you'll find in many other Reeman novels, and so too is the developing romance between Our Hero and The Girl -- who, like so many of Reeman's female characters serves primarily, if not exclusively, as a love interest for Our Hero. And as is also typical in Reeman novels, the ship itself, in this case HMS Terrapin, an ancient frigate due for the scrap yard, is also one of the story's central characters. You may well find yourself attracted to her as much, or more, than any of the humans populating the story.<br />Although I put off reading this title for a while, for fear of not enjoying a non-World War II plot, I shouldn't have worried. Instead, I think this is one of the best Reeman titles I've read so far. Reeman's ability to weave a good story usually overcomes the stock nature of his characters. If you don't mind sailing with people you'll think you've met before, I predict Reeman fans -- or any fan of the war-at-sea genre -- will get a lot out of this title.he best Reeman titles I've read so far.

Important and inspiring and worthy of respect as those stories are, they can tend to get somewhat monotonous, and so a few of those histories include special sections on Liberty ships or the convoy system.<br />I found 'Sea War' much more interesting than most of those other histories, because it's one of the very few histories I've seen so far that look at the Merchant Marine as an institution as well as a collection of individuals and ships. Riesenberg begins his look at America's merchant sailors and fleet well before the war, and continues it into the 1950s, showing how the peculiar culture of the Merchant Service affected how the war was waged and then, in turn, how the war affected the industry. Not just a history of logistics and battles, it is also a revealing sociological study, showing how many misunderstandings and tensions arose because of the Merchant Marine's unique culture and way of doing business -- especially between civilian Merchant Mariners and their uniformed counterparts in the Navy.<br />If you're interested in this still relatively neglected area of the history of World War Two, I encourage you to track down a copy of this old but useful title.	2002-12-29

But recently, Churchill has been the subject of two great little survey volumes about his amazing and important life -- John Lukacs' \\"Churchill: Visionary. Statesman. Historian.\\" and this title by John Keegan.<br />Churchill's immense life seems to draw immensity from his biographers, for example, Roy Jenkins' thick one-volume biography, Manchester's planned trilogy (now apparently marooned forever at two volumes), and, of course, the official biography by Randolph Churchill and Martin Gilbert, which toppped off at eight biographic volumes and sixteen additional companion volumes. Doing Churchill justice in under 200 pages is much tougher, but Keegan, a skilled historian, pulls it off very well.<br />As Paul Johnson did in his excellent Penguin Life of Napoleon, Keegan focused on a few major themes of Churchill's life and weaves his narrative around them. One of his major emphases is on how the lessons Churchill learned in his early life prepared him for his later years by shaping (or mis-shaping) his thinking on critical ethical and strategic issues. Churchill's often-overlooked career as social reformer is given due attention here, while the discussion of the war years emphasizes Churchill's -- and Britain's -- increasing military weakness and strategic isolation amidst the rising tides of American and Soviet power.<br />Keegan argues that Churchill's greatest achievement was that his \\"words drowned out the drumbeat of totalitarianism\\" when Britain stood alone (p. 145).<br />If there was anything I found off-putting about his analysis, it was Keegan's frequent use of the word \\"libertarian\\" to describe Churchill's political world view. It perhaps becomes clearer in context what exactly he means by this -- essentially, support for individual freedom and opposition to totalitarianism. Yet as a libertarian myself, it was passing strange for me to see Churchill consistently described as \\"a true libertarian\\" (p. 96) ... \\"philosophically a libertarian\\" (p. 103) ... and having \\"an acute libertarian awareness\\" of communism's evil (p. 177). Indeed, Keegan also describes leaders of the Labour Party of the 1940s as \\"sincere libertarians,\\" while at the same time describing their \\"doctrinaire economic views\\" in support of nationalization and central planning. All we can assume is that Keegan's definition of this term is different from how, say, the Cato Institute would use it, Murray Rothbard even moreso.<br />Apart from that minor semantic difference, though, I truly enjoyed this quick (I read it in about a day) yet comprehensive view of Churchill's life, impact, and legacy. By all means, read the longer bios if you wish. But if you're looking for a short summary that encapsulates why so many people in so many lands hold Winston Churchill in such high regard, this Penguin Life is a great place to start (and might be even better if read in concert with Lukacs' book).was passing strange for me to see Churchill consistently described as \\"a true libertarian\\" (p. 96) ... \\"philosophically a libertarian\\" (p. 103) ... and having \\"an acute libertarian awareness\\" of communism's evil (p. 177).

By all means, read the longer bios if you wish. But if you're looking for a short summary that encapsulates why so many people in so many lands hold Winston Churchill in such high regard, this Penguin Life is a great place to start (and might be even better if read in concert with Lukacs' book).	2002-12-27

On page 242, Bob Woodward writes \\"[Deputy national security advisor Steve] Hadley, taking notes in a steno pad, was thinking that they were having too many meetings that week. Fatigue was starting to show.\\" I found this book somewhat fatiguing too, and for much the same reason.<br />There's no question that Bob Woodward is a Very Important Journalist who writes Very Important Books that Everyone Reads. But that doesn't guarantee an exciting read, and this one took some effort to slog through. Though the first section, chronicling the President and his staff's immediate reactions to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, have a certain excitement and immediacy (I read the first 70 pages in one sitting), that pace is not sustained as Woodward takes us to meeting after meeting after meeting. Indeed, \\"met\\" -- as in, \\"attended a meeting\\" -- is probably the most frequently used word in this book, with \\"said\\" a close second. While important things are happening in the wide world, this book seems trapped, most of the time, in the White House situation room, and therefore feels rather claustrophobic.<br />Another difficulty with this book is the very fact that it was written by a Very Important Journalist who writes Very Important Books that Everyone Reads. In speaking with, and recalling their motivations and reactions to important events, the officials under Woodward's microscope know they're dealing with perhaps America's most prominent journalist and power groupie. Even when politics is (said to be) not a concern -- with the exclusion of Karl Rove from key strategy meetings (p. 205) -- folks in Washington understand, as Jurek Martin pointed out in the Financial Times recently, that a key to success in D.C. is to play along with Bob Woodward. Those who do, like President Bush, get painted in heroic colors. Those who are less willing to indulge him, reportedly including Don Rumsfeld, go down in Very Important Books in a much less flattering light. In \\"Bush at War,\\" the author is very much part of the story, even though he generally keeps himself behind the curtain.<br />Finally, the time frame of this book seems somewhat random. The main narrative ends before there's any sort of resolution in Afghanistan. It just stops. Much of the rest of the story is told in an Epilogue that was, in many ways, more interesting than the rest of the book, in that it blends action and words instead of being primarily a transcription of meetings. In this section, the most compelling character was Secretary of State Colin Powell, apparently fighting a one-man battle against the \\"unilateralists\\" (today's term of opprobrium) in the rest of the Administration.<br />On the whole, this is a moderately interesting look at how important decisions are made by senior White House officials in times of crisis -- or at least THIS White House in THIS time of crisis. If reading about the meetings gets dull and repetitive at times, at least we can say that the people in those meetings apparently often viewed them precisely the same way.author is very much part of the story, even though he generally keeps himself behind the curtain.<br />Finally, the time frame of this book seems somewhat random.

In fact, it's divided into a number of easily digestible essays from great writers, including Lysander Spooner, Frank Chodorov, and Robert LeFevre, among others. McElroy's own contribution is her remarkable and memorable piece, \\"Why I Would Not Vote Against Hitler,\\" while Watner presents nothing less than \\"The Case Against Democracy.\\"<br />To make the case for not voting, and for rejecting political activism, is to swim against the tide of nearly everything modern Americans are taught to value -- as well as against much of the modern \\"Libertarian\\" movement, which views libertarianism as a competitive \\"public policy\\" option instead of what it properly is: a rejection of \\"public policy\\" altogether. These provocative and well-argued essays make a solid argument that, in contributor George Smith's words, \\"libertarians should oppose, not this or that Senator, but the office of 'Senator' itself\\" (p. 53), and help to recapture the time-honored libertarian conviction that voting is, in itself, an intolerable act of aggression against others.<br />I very highly recommend this challenging title.	2002-12-24

It probably wasn't original when it featured in the 1976 film [[ASIN:B00005N5S3 Midway (Collector's Edition)]] and it has also been a major part of at least two recent murder mysteries -- this one, and Max Allan Collins' [[ASIN:0425179435 The Pearl Harbor Murders]] (2001), a book that has more in common with this one than just the title.<br /><br />Considering that Collins' mystery and this one are built around the same set of real-life facts, events, and personalities, I was surprised by how much poorer a job Walker did with it all than Collins did. Some of the things \\"historical figures\\" do in this book struck me as uncharacteristic, based on what I've read about them in real life. One or two, in fact, seem to show up for no other reason than to have one more \\"historical figure\\" cameo. And speaking of \\"uncharacteristic,\\" how likely is it that a naval intelligence specialist would reveal so much of her operation to a reporter she's barely met? And was naval intelligence HQ at Pearl Harbor really so easy to break into (by crawling through the air ducts, speaking of clich&eacute;s)?<br /><br />Without giving anything away, I'll say that one fairly substantial subplot involving an \\"historical figure\\" is largely irrelevant to the novel. It could have been left out altogether without weakening the narrative. As another reviewer notes, everything that happens in this book before the action shifts to Hawaii could have been summarized in much less space -- especially since much of what we're left with from that section are unresolved plot threads. As it is, the title murder doesn't even happen until the second half of the book. Instead, we get long descriptions of irrelevancies, like one character getting dressed, or another drinking a glass of milk.<br /><br />I have some other problems with the plot too, but listing them would give away too much of the solution to the mystery.<br /><br />Finally, one of the things I really liked about the Collins book was the way it wove the \\"atmospherics\\" of pre-war Hawaii into the story. Walker, on the other hand, has little of this. He can tell the story, but doesn't really invoke the \\"feel\\" of Hawaii nearly so well. I was hoping for much better, and I was really disappointed.I have some other problems with the plot too, but listing them would give away too much of the solution to the mystery.

It's not a perfect book, and maybe someday I'll write a column somewhere about how D'Souza fundamentally mis-states the libertarian philosophy, and libertarian beliefs on some key issues. In that section, at least, he does his young friend &quot;Chris&quot; a real disservice. It's only because that's such a relatively small part of the book that I'm not downgrading my ranking more.<br />But apart from that (and the author's annoying idolatry -- it's not too strong a word -- of Lincoln), there is much here to learn from and enjoy. If campus conservatives can arm themselves with the information -- and also the techniques -- D'Souza passes along here, the political atmosphere of our colleges will be much improved, and much more entertaining.	2002-11-30

Goldstein and Katherine V. Dillon, produced the essential trilogy on the before-during-and-after of the attack, &quot;At Dawn We Slept&quot; (1981), &quot;December 7, 1941&quot; (1988), and &quot;Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History&quot; (1986). In this book, Dillon and Goldstein produce some of their essential primary sources, key Japanese documents about the planning, execution, and aftermath of the attack.<br />One of the key distinctives of Prange's research and writing was that, unlike so many other writers about the attack, he never forgot the Japanese half of the equation. In fact, the Pearl Harbor attack was a massive tactical undertaking, and the Japanese carried it off brilliantly. Focusing entirely on, for example, how much FDR knew and when, means ignoring the magnitude of the Japanese accomplishment.<br />Prange never made this mistake. And it's his research and interviews in Japan that produced this important work, assembled and published by his two assistants. While &quot;The Pearl Harbor Papers&quot; may be too esoteric for casual students of the Day of Infamy, people with a more serious interest in the attack, or the Pacific War generally, will find much here to keep themselves occupied.<br />Of particular interest are several papers and affidavits by Minoru Genda, the key planner of the attack. Also very interesting is &quot;An Intimate Look at the Japanese Navy,&quot; by Masataka Chihaya, a former officer of the Imperial Japanese Navy, who shortly after the end of the war cataloged his services' successes and failures. It's a very clear-eyed document, and deserves a close reading.<br />On the whole, this is a very good book to add to your shelf of Pearl Harbor books (and anyone who has such a shelf unquestionably needs this).	2002-11-30

Theobald makes in this book have been fleshed out further by the research of later writers. In particular, readers familiar with Stinnett's [[ASIN:0743201299 Day Of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor]] (2000) and Gannon's [[ASIN:B000H2N6YI Pearl Harbor Betrayed: The True Story of a Man and a Nation Under Attack]] (2001) will find many of the same arguments, though in a more condensed fashion, here.<br /><br />The difference, of course, is that Theobald was writing in 1954. And he brings to the table not only the viewpoint of a professional naval officer, but also one who was in fact present in a relatively senior position (Commander, Destroyers, Battle Force) at Pearl Harbor at the time of the attack. His argument is that Roosevelt deliberately backed the Japanese into a position where they had no choice but to launch an attack on the Pacific Fleet -- a fleet that was deliberately weakened, and denied critical information, by orders of the President.<br /><br />Theobald does a fine job presenting his evidence and drawing (in my opinion) solid conclusions. His problem, unfortunately, is the same as Stinnett's: he lacks the smoking gun that places blame solidly in FDR's lap. The author can draw an evidentiary noose around the President, but can't quite close in the rest of the way. The nearest he can come is a 1945 comment by Admiral Stark that everything he did in the days prior to the attack, including refusing to forward key information intercepted from coded Japanese messages to the commanders in Hawaii, he did on higher orders. Of course, as Theobald points out, Stark was the senior admiral in the Navy. The only \\"higher\\" place orders could come from was Roosevelt himself.<br /><br />If Theobald's analysis has weaknesses (apart from the evidentiary ones), they are (1) his willingness to trust the motives of senior military and naval commanders implicitly, and (2) his apparent agreement with the idea that it was \\"psychologically essential to the successful prosecution of the war\\" that the \\"prestige\\" of Roosevelt and his Administration not be undermined during the war by suggestions they deliberately precipitated the attack (p. 157). I can't accept this second, but it's his opinion and he's entitled to it. The first weakness is the more serious: Theobald believes senior military commanders of high personal and professional reputation would never willingly do anything to put their ships and sailors at risk. Therefore, he argues, the fact that they did exactly that proves they must have been ordered to do so by FDR himself. This \\"evidence\\" seems to assume as much as it \\"proves.\\"<br /><br />On the whole, however, this book is an important part of the so-called \\"revisionist\\" school of Pearl Harbor scholarship. Later research, including many facts not available to Theobald in the 1950s, substantiates many of his arguments. And if it's still not possible to prove conclusively every part of the statement, \\"Roosevelt knew the Japanese were going to attack Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941,\\" Theobald's *J'accuse* makes it clear that FDR's hands are, at any rate, far from clean.

I know I didn't expect to.<br />For one thing, I've never enjoyed basketball, and don't think I've ever in my life sat through a basketball game end-to-end, either live or on TV. And I had seen other reviewers' complaints about Conroy's wordiness.<br />But as it turned out, I enjoyed this book a lot -- not only for the revelations about sports and manhood and (my particular interest) life at a military college, but also for the author's sheer storytelling ability and skill at bringing people to life on the page.<br />Yes, Conroy can be wordy. With a bit of effort, this book could have been 100 or so pages shorter. But frankly, I don't mind. Conroy's writing has always been intensely personal -- both about himself and *for* himself. He makes a passing reference here to writing &quot;the books which explain who I am to myself&quot; (p. 163), and later to finding &quot;the gargoyles and stunted trolls that ate me alive&quot; (p. 344). If he sometimes confuses his basketball season with the Trojan War, and waxes Homeric about every drop of sweat that fell to the hardwood during that miserable, wonderful year, it's because that's how this season looms in his life (aided and abetted by an English professor, Colonel John Doyle, who himself compared Conroy to Hector). I'm more than willing to let Conroy frame his season in those terms in return for his letting me into his introspection.<br />While Conroy was failing as a point guard, he was also discovering himself as a writer, and it's this part of his story that I found most compelling -- that and the post-season (thirty years post-season) discoveries and reflections that finally knit this group of individuals, once and for all, into a team.<br />Anyone who's ever read &quot;The Great Santini&quot; will want to read this, to discover &quot;the rest of the story&quot; about Conroy's father and the impact that book had on his life and family.<br />I didn't expect to like this book, but I really do, and recommend it highly.

From a writer's standpoint, I can see why such an idea would be tempting -- not only do you get a \\"character\\" pre-invented, as it were, but you also, as author Max Allan Collins admits to doing in his acknowledgements, can write about people you particularly admire or are interested in. Much the same reasoning applies, I suppose, to readers of these kinds of stories. If you, too, are a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs, seeing him and his son investigate a murder might be a very compelling read.<br />Myself, I'm more a student of the Pearl Harbor attack, and I read this mystery in part for the story itself, but mostly to see how the author wove the true-life events of late 1941 into his story. And the answer is, pretty well (of course, he's had some practice at this, having written several other disaster-based murder mysteries as well).<br />The crime-solving part of the story is a fairly standard follow-the-clues/unravel-the-secrets tale, and if it had been set in Dubuque in 1974, I don't think I would have given it more than three stars. But it's the way the tale is woven into the larger historical context of the Pearl Harbor attack (and it's not giving away any plot secrets to say that the attack ends up being part of the story) that's most interesting to me, and the author pulled it off quite well. True-life events, like the Mori \\"flowers in bloom\\" radiotelephone message (which may or may not have been in code), or a front-porch meeting between Colonel Kendall Fielder and General Walter Short on the evening of December 6, are drafted into service as part of this story. Author Collins credits his researcher, and lists in his acknowledgements many of the key titles in Pearl Harbor historiography, including the Prange trilogy. I second that commendation, because the factual scaffolding on which this story hangs seems pretty solid to me. Collins also does a nice job with the general \\"atmospherics\\" of late-1941 Honolulu.<br />On the whole, the setting and the real-world history involved elevate the workmanlike mystery quite a bit.

Instead, it turned out to be one of the many, many books cranked out to serve as inspirational or &quot;leadership&quot; guides to standing by your principles in times of crisis. It's also one of the latest examples of the trend of political candidates publishing autobiographies or books on weighty topics in order to prove they're serious thinkers (Ms Harris is now the Representative-elect from Florida's 13th Congressional district).<br />This isn't meant to disparage Ms Harris. This book proves her to be thoughtful, intelligent, articulate, and well-read. And apart from the fact that those four qualities are rare enough in our politicians, she's also, frankly, pretty unremarkable. Her lists of books that have influenced her are exactly the sorts of things one would expect to find: Noonan on Reagan, Manchester on Churchill, McCullough on Adams (Raimondo on Rothbard? Now *that* would have been a refreshing surprise!). Her twelve key principles, while undoubtedly good ideas by which to live a life, are again nothing particularly new or visionary (though I appreciated Principle 6: Feed Your Mind, which puts more emphasis on reading and intellectual development, and especially on reading old as well as, or in place of, new books, than many similar titles seem to). Woven throughout all this is Ms Harris' narrative of the Florida election &quot;crisis.&quot;<br />I imagine that this book might be very popular among certain audiences. I'm just not sure which audiences those would be. On the whole, it's not a difficult or exasperating read. The passions it seems to arouse have more to do with the author's celebrity (or notoriety) than with the principles or ideas it contains. It's not a bad book. It's just ... unremarkable.	2002-11-18

I've never met Miss Chavez, however -- though, after reading this book, I wouldn't mind doing so someday.)<br />In the whole vast array of American culture, few people are as morally represensible as those who insist that a person's race or ethnicity (or sex or sexual preference) MUST inevitably define their world view and, more to the point, their politics. Linda Chavez \\"became the most hated Hispanic in America\\" by maintaining -- and, worse, passionately and effectively defending -- ideas that are out of step with what we're told Hispanics are \\"supposed to\\" believe.<br />But this book is a biography, not a political tract. Miss Chavez tells us her life story, focusing on her evolution from Young People's Socialist League-member in the 1960s to highly-visible neocon today. Along the way, she gives us a moving portrayal of her family's climb out of poverty, her devotion to family and friends (and theirs to her), an inside look at political activism on both the left and right, and -- no small thing -- one of the most damning portrayals of 1970s campus radicalism since David Horowitz.<br />In keeping with her theme of \\"the transformation of an ex-liberal,\\" the pace of  Miss Chavez's narrative picks up somewhat once she becomes an ex-liberal. The actively political period of her life seems rather rushed compared to the earlier sections of her book, as though the author was in a hurry to get to, and through, the story of her withdrawn nomination as Labor Secretary after the 2000 election. If Miss Chavez had chosen to flesh out this portion of her life a bit more, I'm sure it would have been just as interesting as the rest of her story turned out to be.<br />This book reveals a lot about the real nature of American politics, and much of it isn't very pretty.

This putative \\"biography\\" of Empress Elisabeth of Austria (1837-98) is a very strange book. It is usually filed in the biography section, but may just as well be listed as fiction. It gives us a few interesting insights into its subject, but is certainly not reliable as an actual biography.<br />Published anonymously in 1899, not long after the subject's assassination at the hands of an Italian radical, this book seems, in many ways, a standard biography of the Empress' life. Yet large portions of it describe the female author's first-person interactions with Her Majesty. These include time alone together in the Empress' private rooms in her various palaces, riding together across the plains of Hungary, an action-packed vacation in Brittany in which the Empress and the author resuscitate sailors shipwrecked in a storm, and many intimate and personal discussions. The latter include a moving scene following the wedding of Crown Prince Rudolf, when \\"Elizabeth, with a swift movement, came toward me, flung herself upon the floor, and, burying her proud head upon my knees, burst into an uncontrollable passion of tears\\" (p. 175).<br />Rudolf himself (according to these pages), tells the author she and he \\"have always been awful chums\\" (p. 195).<br />The problem is, there's no evidence any of these things actually happened.<br />The anonymous author, it's now known, was Marguerite Cunliffe-Owen, an American author who at the turn of the last century wrote a syndicated gossip column under the pseudonym, \\"Marquise de Fontenoy.\\" Far from being an intimate friend of the Empress, Cunliffe-Owen's name appears in none of the more recent and reputable biographies of the Empress I've consulted, nor does this book appear in any of their bibliographies or indices. The highly dramatic (and, you would think, memorable) rescued-sailors scene also is no place to be found in any of the numerous printed or online biographies of the Empress that I've consulted.<br />If you already know something about the Empress's life and death, this book can be an entertaining (and/or infuriating) example of instant celebrity journalism at its worst.

It was intended as a primer on the \\"complexities of twenty-first century defense\\" (p. 10), and in response to a defense contractor's sneer that all the American people need to know about national defense is \\"spend money.\\" Well written, non-jargony, and easily accessible, \\"Against All Terrors\\" is a great way for the reasonably intelligent citizen to get up to speed on the challenges and opportunities facing our defense apparatus, and how those shape, and are shaped by, the new war.<br />The book itself is divided into four sections. In the first, \\"The War of the Ways,\\" Gold argues that the world has left the era of ideologically-driven conflict, and entered one of protracted struggle between modern, liberal (in the sense of *free*) cultures, and those who reject modernity and liberalism. In the second section, Gold takes us through the Wasted Nineties, in which the systemic problems within America's fighting forces (as they used to be known) became both obvious and debilitating. The third section lays out Gold's vision for an effective twenty-first century fighting force.<br />The final section, also titled \\"Against All Terrors,\\" looks beyond the military to the question of whether the American people have within them- (our-) selves the necessary sprit and resolve to win the War of the Ways. This thoughtful, eloquent, and historically informed chapter demonstrates that \\"the American spirit\\" in fact runs far deeper, and more meaningfully, than the rah-rah flag-waving and Love-It-or-Leave-It patriotism of some recent books (Sean Hannity's comes to mind).<br />The \\"Readings and Browsings\\" appendix is also quite good.<br />I particularly enjoyed Gold's tracings of the history of the Defense Department, the military and naval services, and the rise of inter-service rivalries. His principle that \\"systems proliferate, effects converge\\" (p. 55) is a valuable teaching tool. And his discussion of \\"transformation\\" -- the military reform doctrine that's already morphed from cutting-edge theory to buzzword to clich&eacute; -- and its sister, \\"revolution in military affairs\\" or RMA, cuts through all the Pentagonese to lay out what the idea really means for the services and for the country.<br />In all, Gold's book is a fast but thought-provoking read. Far more than those weighty tomes produced by Establishment think-tanks and refugees from the Clinton administration and the New York Times op-ed page, \\"Against All Terrors\\" is a book any citizen concerned about our nation's defense and the new war can and probably should read with profit.to mind).<br />The \\"Readings and Browsings\\" appendix is also quite good.<br />I particularly enjoyed Gold's tracings of the history of the Defense Department, the military and naval services, and the rise of inter-service rivalries.

Certainly, other writers have covered this ground with more specialization and/or style (I found the author's &quot;breezy&quot; tone somewhat annoying at times). But if you're a book lover who's just starting to think about taking better care of your collection -- or discovering that people have actually written books about collecting books -- then this guide probably isn't a bad place to start.<br />This Booklover's Guide covers a wide range of topics -- everything from auditing your collection, to deciding what and how to collect, to classification and storage, to repair (including serious stuff like rebinding and chemical cleaning). And there are sections on archives, professional librarians, the history of the book, and more. In short, more information, probably, than most casual readers will probably need. If, like me, the major classification in your library is &quot;Stuff I Like,&quot; and your main motive in collecting the books is the hopeful optimism that someday you'll have read them all, then a good deal of the information here may be of less use to you. On the other hand, if you have a serious collection of old or rare titles, signed first editions, or other reasons to have a real interest in long-term preservation, then this might not be a bad place to get started.<br />One thing I can't criticize is the author's obvious love of books and book collecting. This title is a good introduction to the universe of bibliophilia. If you're already an experienced traveler in that universe, you probably don't need this book. But if you're a new arrival or casual tourist, this guide could come in fairly handy. You may never use most of the information here, but that's probably true of any Fodor's guide too.e of any Fodor's guide too.	2002-10-23

Books	5	15	21	N	N	Historian as politician and vice versa	About halfway through Lukacs' chapter on Churchill and Eisenhower, I wrote down the phrase I used to title this review. One of the author's missions is to explore how Churchill's study and writing of history shaped his politics, statesmanship, and \\"vision.\\"  And sure enough, just a few dozen pages later, Lukacs himself, modifying a phrase of J.H. Plumb, described Churchill as \\"a historian-statesman and a statesman-historian\\" (p. 102).<br />John Lukacs is himself a great writer and interpreter of history. And though I've read lots of things about Churchill over the years, few historians have impressed me as he has with their ability to synthesize and interpret. By all means, still read the longer biographies -- Gilbert, naturally, as well as Best and Jenkins more recently. But let Lukacs help you sort out what it all means. Among other things, you may well find yourself agreeing with him that Churchill \\"was not The Last Lion\\" (p. 17).<br />Lukacs' description of Churchill as a patriot but not a nationalist (as contrasted with Hitler, who was a nationalist but not a patriot) is also a revealing one -- especially in an era when the two are too easily confused.<br />Hundreds or thousands of volumes have been written on Churchill as statesman and war leader. But only one (Maurice Ashley's \\"Churchill as Historian,\\" 1968), plus a few journal articles, have viewed him as a student and writer of history and tried to assess how that affected his other spheres of life. Lukacs views it as central, giving Churchill, as it did, a philosophy of history (p. 123) as well as a world view that allowed him to place events and ideas in their larger historical context (Lukacs sees this as the essential difference between Churchill and Eisenhower).<br />Given the resurgence of interest in Churchill -- which never entirely wanes, of course -- post-9/11, several of Lukacs' insights and conclusions may come as a surprise, or be considered \\"controversial\\": notably, that Churchill's famous \\"Iron Curtain\\" speech in Fulton was less about the dangers posed by communism *per se* than about those inherent in a divided Europe; that Churchill's glory was not that he won a great victory, but rather that he prevented a great defeat; and that in his dealings with Stalin during and after the war, he tried \\"to save what was possible\\" (p. 182). This last point Lukacs deploys (in an excellent chapter on Churchill's failures and his critics) against those who hold Churchill to blame for the \\"loss\\" of Eastern Europe to communism (through the Machiavellian \\"percentages deal,\\" for example). Lukacs argues that Churchill recognized there were only two real options: All of Europe dominated by Hitler, or half of Europe dominated by Stalin. There was, Lukacs says, no third way.<br />Duff Cooper, a Churchillian, once wrote that one of the problems with democracies is that too few democratic leaders have read any history. Lukacs shows how Churchill's own reading and writing prepared him for the challenges of his century. Readers of this book, in turn, emerge with a clearer view, not only of those challenges, but also of The Man of the Century himself. Very highly recommended.on Curtain\\" speech in Fulton was less about the dangers posed by communism *per se* than about those inherent in a divided Europe; that Churchill's glory was not that he won a great victory, but rather that he prevented a great defeat; and that in his dealings with Stalin during and after the war, he tried \\"to save what was possible\\" (p. 182).

Few things can make the tedium of a long drive more bearable than the prospect of a decent place to eat along the way, and the restaurants listed in this guide are destinations in their own right.<br />Helpfully arranged by sections of the country, road food aficionados will find more than enough to keep them busy. Personally, I wanted to take off and tour Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, as well as old haunts in Virginia. Being in the opposite corner of the country, though, I found a number of interesting looking places here to check out (as well as one or two I've already been to, and so I can attest to the reliability of the Stern's reviews).<br />I should note, though, that family members in Cody, Wyoming tell me that Franca's, which the Sterns list in this book, has in fact been closed for several years. So *caveat lector.* Things can change quickly in the restaurant world. Nevertheless, this is both a great reference and a fun title just for entertaining (if stomach growl-inducing) reading.

And as Barbara Bush herself has noted, it's &quot;fate and an extraordinary husband&quot; (p. 141) that have made her part of history. However, Barbara Bush has always been a popular individual -- sometimes much more so than her husband. And for casual fans looking for an inoffensive and readable popular biography, this work by Pamela Killian more than fits the bill.<br />On its own terms, it does have its weak points. How much weight you choose to give them depends on what exactly you're looking for, I suppose. For example, there's no evidence Mrs. Bush herself was interviewed for this book -- although according to the acknowledgements some current and former staff-members and friends were. Many of the quotes, and much of the other information, are recycled from newspaper coverage and other media sources (including, interestingly, an episode of the A&amp;E cable network's &quot;Biography&quot; program). Author Kilian also gives a disturbing amount of emphasis to those notoriously fickle (as well as politically tendentious) &quot;polls of presidential historians.&quot;<br />There are also a couple of errors (arguably minor) that need to be pointed out, including a misquotation of Al Gore's famous &quot;no controlling legal authority&quot; phrase (p. 217) and an odd mention of the House of Representatives' &quot;interference&quot; with the election of 1824 (there was no &quot;interference,&quot; just the process laid out in the Constitution).<br />Where I thought this biography particularly shined, though, was in the discussion of Barbara Bush's 1990 commencement address at Wellesley College (pp.146-53). Some feminists in the graduating class had objected to Mrs. Bush's presence, on the grounds that she had no individual achievements and was only being honored because of whom she was married to. Mrs. Bush handled that issue well at the time, and Kilian does the same here. I found this chapter, in many ways, the defining point of the book, giving testimony (if any were needed) to the value of the life Barbara Bush has led.<br />While not terribly in depth or deeply psychologically revealing, this biography does give a good picture of a woman who, in my opinion, justifies the high regard in which she is still held by so many people. Think what you will about her husband's and/or son's politics, it's harder not to like the Silver Fox, as this title helps make clear.e was married to.

His politics are much the same. His long-time concerns are still in the front of his mind. And his voice (self-assured if you like it, pompous if you don't) is as distinctive as ever. Will's fans will want to add this book to their collection. If you're not a fan, the columns here collected may not convert you.<br />This title helps cement Will's reputation as America's leading spokesman for (as I once heard Buckley described) &quot;conservatism of a sort.&quot; The columns include his argument that &quot;Capitalism is a Government Project&quot; (p. 222), his endorsement of General Sherman's war of extermination against the South as a model for defeating terrorism (p. 71), and his defense of &quot;the seamlessness of cultural memory&quot; (p. 184). I was glad to see his memorable and important &quot;Clinton's Legacy: An Adjective&quot; (p. 237) printed here in its entirety, not in the bowdlerized form in which it appeared in several newspapers.<br />Given the time span this book covers (1997-2002), I was surprised there aren't more columns about the three central events of the era: impeachment, the 2000 elections, and September 11, 2001. Will wrote a lot more about them at the time, of course, but only a select few columns made the cut into this book. As in any collection, a lot of ground is covered, from politics to pop culture. Over time, many of the &quot;news hooks&quot; these columns are based on will fade -- if they haven't already faded -- from memory. But even then, the real value, Will's ability to articulate his principles, will stand out all the more.	2002-10-07

But it's still, for my money, one of the most useful, insightful, and entertaining looks at the political and psychological makeup of the Bush (41) White House.<br />Podhoretz is especially good on the tensions between the true-blue Reaganite holdovers and the &quot;moderate,&quot; &quot;pragmatic&quot; Bushies -- tensions that not only tore at the Bush presidency but at the GOP as a whole. 41 himself emerges as a man who was, if anything, too nice a guy for the presidency. His insistence, post-election, that OEOB staffers take down a large sign declaring (prophetically?) &quot;We'll be back!&quot; so as not to display &quot;poor sportsmanship&quot; is a fascinating contrast, viewed a decade later, with the GAO's evidence of vandalism carried out by departing Clinton staffers.<br />Podhoretz writes with flair, energy, and a good eye for both politics and comedy. Go ahead and read Baker and Scowcroft for the nitty-gritty. Podhoretz has the atmosphere.	2002-10-07

It's not really a cookbook, either. And Robert L. Wolke isn't quite the Cecil Adams of food, although sometimes he comes close. What this is, is a very useful and informative guide to food and cooking.<br />Wolke covers basic issues like &quot;What is a calorie?&quot; ... &quot;What's the best way to defrost frozen food?&quot; ... and &quot;What's the point of clarified butter.&quot; And he addresses more complex ones, related to fats, various methods of cooking, the hows-and-whys of microwaves, and much more. He does so with a certain degree of flair and humor, but is also chock full of information. He clearly knows his stuff. Keep in mind, though, that most of what's in here originally appeared in the form of newspaper columns. That may be one explanation for why these answers sometimes aren't as in depth as some reviewers might have preferred.<br />(Interestingly, Wolke's answer to the question &quot;How do they get the non-stick coating to stick to the pan?&quot; gives us the opportunity for a head-to-head test with Cecil Adams, who answers the same question in one of his Straight Dope books. Personally, I think Cecil came out ahead, but your opinion may vary.)<br />What I found most interesting (apart from the chapter on fat, for some reason) was Wolke's deconstruction of the arguments against irradiated food. Keep this section handy for the next time someone wails about &quot;the equivalent of one billion chest X-rays&quot; (the correct response to which, Wolke notes, is &quot;So what?&quot;).<br />Absorbing the knowledge here will, I think, make you both a better cook and a more informed consumer. And both of those are good things.	2002-10-07

This book isn't about the latter. It's &quot;only&quot; about the former: the act of cooking meat (and other things) over fire.<br />I say &quot;only&quot; because this book is extremely comprehensive. While I tend to be skeptical of anything calling itself a &quot;bible&quot; that isn't actually, you know, The Bible, it's hard to image there's much of anything left out of this. Not only does the author deal with the perennial questions -- charcoal versus gas, types of wood smoke, varieties of sauces, and so on -- he also addresses related topics like drinks, salads, and desserts.<br />Where this book is most impressive, however, is in the amazing variety of recipes. Within pages, he takes us from Nigeria to South-East Asia, the Mideast to South America, to Japan (plus, of course, Kansas City, the Carolinas, and Texas), and from beef through pork and fowl to seafood and vegetarian options, and more. If you can slap it on a grill, Steven Raichlen can probably tell you how to cook it.<br />The good ol' boys at the cook-off might be shocked and appalled to find things like grilled salad niçoise or Japanese dengaku (&quot;tofu on stilts&quot;) calling themselves &quot;barbecue,&quot; but if you can get over the cultural difficulties, you'll find enough here to keep you busy over the coals for many a long summer.	2002-10-04

When the baseball season ended last week (for us Mariners fans, anyway), another friend quoted Bart Giamatti's famous elegy that begins, &quot;It breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart.&quot; Like they say about the spaghetti sauce, &quot;It's in there.&quot;<br />More than any other sport, I think, baseball seems to inspire writing that's lyrical without being cheesy or cloying. That much is apparent in this collection, which also treats us to &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; (naturally), Owen Johnston, Ring Lardner, Nelson Algren, Jimmy Breslin, Roger Angell, and much more (but, I observe without comment, no George Will). When my lovely bride gave me this collection back in June, I knew it would be a perfect companion for the season. Now I'm finding it an even better companion for the still young off-season. So as we try to figure out how many days are left until pitchers and catchers report to spring training, this great collection of fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and prose will carry us forward, and back, to summer.	2002-10-04

Bosworth was (he died in 1986) a career journalist, a prolific writer of fiction and non-fiction, and witness to many interesting and important events. It's surprising, then, that he produced a history-cum-memoir that left so little impression on me. When I finished it, it didn't strike me as anything remarkable, and when I returned to it a couple of years later, I could remember almost nothing of what I had read in it.<br />That's too bad since, as I say, Bosworth has things to say and the skills with which to say them. This book is a collection of essays, including a history of the navy of the Republic of Texas, a closer look at destroyers and submarines, the stories of various ships lost at sea, and more, ranging from World War Two to Vietnam. Bosworth's own memories are probably the most interesting part of the book, but sadly, they only take up the first few chapters.<br />It's clear that the book's title is accurate: Bosworth did love the Navy. It's sad to think what that love could have produced but, for whatever reason, didn't.	2002-10-04

Jerry terHorst (whose name, as Garry Trudeau once observed, looks like a typo) was a decades-long member of the White House press corps and first press secretary for President Gerald Ford. Between them, they had the skills and experience to produce a serviceable, and entertainingly personal, history of Air Force One. Although the book is now more than a little out of date, it's nevertheless a good overview of the first four decades of presidential air travel.<br />Most interesting, given Albertazzie's personal insights, are the authors' stories of Henry Kissinger's secret trips to Europe for peace negotiations with the North Vietnamese, his equally clandestine trip to China to prepare for President Nixon's public one in 1972 (Albertazzie piloted both trips), and -- in the chapter that opens the book -- Citizen Nixon's post-resignation flight back home to California.<br />The Air Force One of today is almost incomprehensibly advanced relative to the one Albertazzie flew. Nevertheless, for readers interested in the accoutrements of presidential power, tracking down a copy of this book is worth a little effort.	2002-10-04

These are real, working homes, with books, papers, art, people, and dogs (often pugs, I notice) scattered about.

Many also posit a clash of cultures, generally hidebound traditionalists versus egalitarian liberators. Janda's approach is different. Personalities, as such, play little role in his book. In fact, many of the female cadets on whom he focuses are not named in the text at all (although every female graduate in the USMA Class of 1980 is listed in an appendix). This allows him to quote freely from anonymous interviews with them, as well as with contemporary male cadets, faculty, and staff, and allows them, in turn, to speak openly without fear of repercussions. As a result, this book is more comprehensive, more in-depth, and -- paradoxically, perhaps -- both more objective and more personal than many of the other books. This is certainly one of the better portrayals I've yet read of the daily experience of cadet life at the USMA.<br />Books on this topic inevitably include sociological analysis of the traditionally male-dominated military culture, and here too, Janda does a fine job. He neither demonizes opponents of \\"assimilation\\" nor denigrates the military as an institution. At the same time, he makes it clear that West Point, both in its own terms and as a subset of the American military, was (and is) self-consciously, deliberately, and proudly out of step with much of the \\"mainstream\\" of American culture. This has its advantages as well as its severe disadvantages, and Janda doesn't pull his punches when they're appropriate.<br />His analysis raises a number of interesting points of comparison between West Point's admission of women in 1976 and the similar actions of VMI and The Citadel a generation later. His historical review of politicans' use of the military, generally ahead of the culture as a whole, for \\"social engineering\\" is revealing. His frequent refrain that the changes at West Point \\"weren't the women's fault\\" makes his detailing of the hazing, harassment, and -- sometimes -- downright abuse the female cadets suffered all the more shocking.<br />Ultimately, though, the story comes down to the female cadets themselves, and also to their male comrades in the late 1970s and early '80s. They *could* handle West Point, Janda argues, without destroying it as an institution (some Old Grads may still not agree). The author concludes that \\"the profound consequences of sex integration are worth the cost\\" (p. 190). Agree or not, students of military education and of women in the armed services would do well to add this title to their collection.lar actions of VMI and The Citadel a generation later.

They *could* handle West Point, Janda argues, without destroying it as an institution (some Old Grads may still not agree). The author concludes that \\"the profound consequences of sex integration are worth the cost\\" (p. 190). Agree or not, students of military education and of women in the armed services would do well to add this title to their collection.	2002-09-30
1399111:US	53058008	R30YTEORJ5U1NW	B00005XEOT	434540637	Grover Cleveland, the man and the statesman; an authorized biography	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Old-style biography of a very under-rated President.	The year 2000 saw the publication of not one, but two, biographies of America's twenty-second and twenty-fourth President, Grover Cleveland. Given the titles of these two books -- &quot;An Honest President&quot; and &quot;A Study in Character&quot; -- it's tempting to suggest that the authors were looking back more than a century to find something apparently lacking in the then-occupant of the White House. If so, they turned to the right man, for Grover Cleveland was not only an honest man and a man of character, but also a great, if under-rated, president and arguably the last one who really believed in the Constitution.<br />McElroy's two volumes, written nine decades ago, are Cleveland's authorized biography. Unlike so many modern biographies, you won't find muckraking revelations or sophisticated (or pseudo-sophisticated) psychoanalysis. On the other hand, you also won't find the self-justification of so many modern memoirs or authorized biographies. This is just a balanced and informative look at Cleveland's two terms in office, the issues and challenges he faced, and the decisions he made (Cleveland's early life and career is summarized in about 70 pages).<br />McElroy's discussion of the 1888 election is particularly interesting, as well as highly relevant. Cleveland won the popular vote by about 100,000 votes (out of more than 10 million cast), but lost the electoral vote. He refused to challenge the legitimacy of Benjamin Harrison's election, but instead concentrated on regaining the Presidency four years later.<br />McElroy also details what I believe is the most honorable episode of all in the career of this Honorable President, Cleveland's refusal to accept Hawai`i's &quot;request&quot; to become an American territory in 1894. Cleveland discovered that US troops had been involved in a coup against the Hawai`ian monarchy, and that the new &quot;government&quot; in the Islands was an illegitimate one. He thus refused to send the annexation treaty to the Senate, and ordered the military to restore the monarchy. Alas, Cleveland's successors would not be so high-minded.<br />In all, though somewhat old fashioned, this biography is a good introduction to this man who is remembered today (if he's remembered at all) solely for his non-consecutive terms. He deserves better from us, and McElroy's bio is a good place to start.nate, and ordered the military to restore the monarchy.

In delving into this and related questions, he draws conclusions that make this title, despite its weaknesses, essential reading for anyone who seeks to understand twentieth century history.<br />The bulk of the book is taken up by Amis' chronicle of Stalin and his terror. He challenges Stalin's comment that \\"one death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic,\\" and draws us into Stalin's bizarre fantasy world -- his war against truth and, indeed, reality. The resultant tens of millions of individual tragedies -- Amis' citations from Solzhenitsyn and other are harrowing -- show how shameful it is that these stories are not as well known as those from the Holocaust.<br />Uncovering why this is true makes up the final, and arguably most important, part of the book. That's because Amis takes aim at the myth -- so often heard even from people who should know better -- that Stalin's \\"excesses\\" were not endemic to communism, but rather were a result of the \\"cult of personality\\" that undermined true communism. Amis is having none of it. Terror, famine, slavery, and failure, \\"monotonous and incorrigible failure\\" (p. 30) are, he argues, the inevitable \\"Communist tetrarchy.\\"<br />For Amis, the lesson of the twentieth century is what it teaches about Leftism and  \\"revolution.\\" Much of this book is intensely personal, because Amis believes some of his dearest friends -- and, for a while, his father as well -- were duped by Stalin and his mania. In wrestling with the ghost of Stalin, Amis is wrestling too with their demons, and his own. After gazing, in these pages, upon the twenty million, his conclusion that \\"the Revolution was a lie\\" (p. 258) is hard to refute.	2002-09-24
1399525:US	53058008	R1AF9DC4LE6FRJ	0679767142	390705768	In Glory's Shadow: The Citadel, Shannon Faulkner, and a Changing America	Books	2	12	15	N	N	Disjointed and Polemical	This book sets out to be many things. It succeeds at none of them. As a result, it's not only disjointed and confusing, but soaked through with bias as well.<br />One the one hand, author Catherine S. Manegold, a defense reporter for the New York Times, writes of the fight over the admission of Shannon Faulkner to The Citadel as a metaphor of South versus North. At the same time, she presents the chronology of a legal battle. And a biography of Ms Faulkner. And a sociological study of life at a military college. If Ms Manegold had concentrated on any one of these things, the book might have been more successful.<br />But apparently she couldn't decide which tack to take, and so the book ends up muddled. Long biographical introductions are given to people who end up playing minor parts in the drama. Lines are drawn for a conflict of cultures -- hidebound, traditional, inbred, hypocritical Charleston versus dynamic, hip, multicultural, liberal New York City -- but this allegory is abandoned as soon as it's developed. The central legal battles are disposed of in a series of 'the lawyers said ... the judges said,' and then, presto!, Ms Faulkner is in the door.<br />Ms Faulkner herself is the central figure in this drama, but at the end of the book, many questions about her remain unanswered. Did she apply to The Citadel purely on a whim, as it seems at first? Did she want the luster that comes with a Citadel ring (The Ring is almost Wagnerian in its significance), the 'network' and 'connections,' without understanding that the network depends on the shared experience of surviving the Citadel? Were her energies so focused on the legal fight that she was unprepared for what she found when she got in? When she left The Citadel, she complained that she had no friends in the school or the Corps. Was she really so naïve as to expect the school she and her lawyers had spent years attacking to offer her a warm embrace once she battered the doors down? None of these questions are adequately answered. It's not even clear whether the days Ms Faulkner spent in the infirmary were due to heat stroke, a mental or emotional breakdown, physical collapse, or something else entirely.<br />Instead, we get strange asides, like the bizarre suggestion that harassment of Ms Faulkner was connected to Caribbean voodoo rituals. Or four irrelevant pages rehashing the charges against one of the Left's favorite targets, the School of the Americas.<br />Interestingly, two of the most evocative sections of the book -- a harrowing account of Hell Week and the strangely moving epilogue 'Fear is like a Tree' -- contain barely a mention of Ms Faulkner at all.<br />Most Americans probably don't have real strong feelings about The Citadel one way or another. On the extremes, though, are people who really, really love the school, and others who really, really hate it. It's pretty clear whose side Ms Manegold is on.<br />Unlike Dr Laura Fairchild Brodie, who wrote about 'assimilation' of women at VMI, Ms Manegold is not 'the band director's wife.' Not, that is, someone who knows the story from the inside. She seems not to have even residual sympathy for The Citadel as an institution, for the young men (and women) who attend it, or for the administrators wrestling with how to adapt to a society that has rejected nearly everything they value. Considering the patronizing, even sneering, tone she sometimes takes toward the military and people who serve in it, it's surprising Ms Manegold could have endured a career as a defense reporter.<br />As Ms Manegold tells it, the original sin of The Citadel was to have been founded for the purpose of training militias in the suppression of slave revolts and the perpetuation of the planter-dominated caste system. The Citadel apparently is tainted by this sin forever, and neither the school nor the author can ever overcome it: she mentions it frequently, often gratuitously. After the War and the end of slavery, The Citadel turned inward, and cadets practiced on one another the social suppression and physical abuse they could no longer impose on slaves. This is what passes for sociological analysis in this book.<br />That's too bad, because there is clearly an interesting and important story here. Maybe someday, someone will find a more effective, less polemical, way to tell it. In the meantime, read Nancy Mace's book instead.rd, and cadets practiced on one another the social suppression and physical abuse they could no longer impose on slaves.

Instead, this book is essentially a history of carrier aviation and the naval war, one that happens to be illustrated primarily by paintings instead of photos. Indeed, the &quot;aviation art&quot; -- much of which is by contemporary artists -- takes a decided back seat to the history. The paintings are reproduced in large size and bright color, but receive scarce mention in the text. Information about the artists themselves is relegated to a few pages of small print in the back.<br />This isn't to take anything away from Paul Stillwell, who is a fine historian (in fact, one of the paintings reproduced in this book, R.G. Smith's &quot;Air Raid, Pearl Harbor,&quot; was earlier used as cover art for Stillwell's book on the December 7 attack). And many of the paintings themselves are excellent. I just think it might have been more accurate to advertise this as an illustrated history of naval aviation in World War Two, rather than as, essentially, a collection of aviation art.	2002-09-17

That means there's no better day to re-read the works of Lysander Spooner -- a writer who, perhaps more than any other, can single-handedly change the way you look at both the Constitution and voting.  This collection is the place to do that, including as it does nearly all of Spooner's most important work: &quot;No Treason&quot; (with &quot;The Constitution of No Authority&quot;), &quot;Vices are not Crimes,&quot; &quot;Trial by Jury,&quot; and his &quot;Letter to Thomas F. Bayard.&quot;<br />Lysander Spooner was a fascinating man in his own right, as both the Introduction by editor George Smith and the first chapter, &quot;Our Nestor Taken From Us,&quot; an obituary by Benjamin Tucker, make clear. Individualist anarchist, abolitionist, scholar, pamphleteer, radical -- it's a shame this Forgotten Hero is so obscure today. But given the skill and passion with which he slaughtered, barbecued, and served up America's most sacred cows, it's hardly surprising.  It's a rare, almost forbidden, treat to find an original thinker any more. As Smith notes in his introduction, it's easy to envy someone reading Spooner for the first time the thought-provoking challenge she's about to experience.<br />Doctrinaires of the left and the right will be horrified by what they read between these pages. And those who still parrot the Received Wisdom of their junior-high &quot;social studies&quot; teachers (it's your duty to vote ... if you don't vote, you can't complain ... in a democracy, the people govern themselves ... &quot;taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society&quot; ... ad infinitum, ad nauseam) will find themselves forced to defend many of their most cherished illusions. To quote Smith again, the ideas are both commonsensical, and very recognizably American. Anyone who gives them the respect they deserve -- thinking about them instead of ignoring them -- will find their view of politics and law fundamentally altered.<br />America would be a very different place if more people burned with Spooner's passionate love of liberty and justice. Of course, that's why you'll never see Lysander Spooner on a public school civics reading list. But don't let that stop you.

That was as true a century or more ago as it is today. Benjamin Perley Poore (&quot;The veteran journalist, clerk of the Senate printing records, editor of the Congressional Directory, and author of various works,&quot; according to the title page) has left us an interesting portrait of his years in Washington City during the nineteenth century.<br />Back before Washington became a puffed-up and self-important &quot;Nation's Capital,&quot; it was simply &quot;the seat of government.&quot; Poore seems to have seen and heard just about everything that happened there between 1827 and 1887. He covers great events -- notably, the War Between the States but much else besides -- but also takes time to recall small but telling incidents, like the time a Senate restaurant-manager was chastised for over-charging Senate pages for their lunches.<br />While hardly an essential read for students of American history, someone who takes the time to dive into Perley's Reminiscences will find a bit more human flesh added to the sometimes-remote figures of American political history.	2002-09-16

That's what books are for. And as someone who has encountered Sean Hannity on radio and TV, I was looking forward to watching him develop an argument over 300 or so pages. Maybe this would be [[ASIN:B000GKK4GY The Conscience of a Conservative]] for our time.<br /><br />No such luck.<br /><br />Certainly, Hannity does a fine job waving the flag and reminding his readers of a few important facts and truths. However, he really hasn't taken advantage of what the print medium offers. Instead, his chapters read like transcripts of his radio shows, or maybe his lecture circuit notes. Much of the news isn't new (the liberals want to abolish the CIA!), and the analysis, while accurate as far as it goes (Mike Spann, good! John Walker Lindh, bad!), seems to stop about halfway down the trail toward the point he's trying to make. Compared to this, Ann Coulter's [[ASIN:1400049520 Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right]] reads like Buckley.<br /><br />I've heard Hannity say, in speeches and on the radio, that his \\"liberty over liberalism\\" subtitle was deliberately chosen. And in fact, he's said that if he'd known how much that formulation would outrage the Left, he'd have made it his title. Unfortunately, Hannity's argumentation takes much for granted: he seems to think it self-evident that a strong CIA and no Clinton defense cuts might have prevented September 11. Those dots, however, remain unconnected.<br /><br />In other cases, Hannity's logic moves in bizarre directions. Here, too, I wish he had made it clearer what he really means. For example, he notes on page 125, \\"I can't tell you how many times I've sent one of my radio producers out on the streets of New York on a Friday afternoon ... to interview people and see if they can recite the Pledge [of Allegiance] -- and they can't. They don't even know the most basic elements of Civics 101. It makes me wonder: How are we supposed to remain 'one nation' and 'indivisible' if we don't teach the next generation the basics of good citizenship and respect for the traditions of our country?\\" Is the author really saying that the most fundamental duty of a citizen (\\"Civics 101\\"), one of \\"the basics of good citizenship,\\" is the ability to recite the Pledge of Allegiance? Is citizenship really that cheap, that its basis is the rote memorization of a few lines of free verse?<br /><br />I wish Hannity had laid out his philosophy of conservatism more explicitly and fully-- with less about Lee Greenwood and the Pledge, and more about the real fundamentals. It would be fascinating to see him set within his context of true-blue Reaganism statements like, \\"It [education reform] means more vouchers, tuition tax credits, and educational savings accounts -- and whatever else it takes to break the nearly total government monopoly on K-12 education in this country\\" (pp. 162-3) Tax-funded vouchers break the government monopoly? Or: \\"In response, we must continue to claim the high ground and continue to preach racial color-blindness and egalitarianism -- strongly and proactively. That's what conservatism is all about\\" (p. 294). Conservatism is all about egalitarianism? Equality of opportunity, sure. But egalitarianism?

In his own era, though, McKinley was honored and popular. And in the context of his time, this memorial book is an enlightening, and even useful, read.<br />Much of the book focuses on McKinley's assassination, making this sort of a prototype of William Manchester's \\"Death of a President,\\" about the Kennedy murder. But there is also a decent biography of the man, the text of several of his speeches, and a number of well-executed illustrations and portraits. I was surprised by the in-depth analysis of the anarchist movement (including an entire chapter on Emma Goldman), and there are also sections on \\"our two other martyr-presidents,\\" Lincoln and Garfield.<br />You won't find any bad things about McKinley here (\\"No figure of modern American history appeals so strongly to the patriotism and love of the American people as William McKinley,\\" p. 3). But taken itself as a memorial of the man's time, this title does help add to our understanding of this president who, more than almost any other, helped push America down the road to Empire.

Though it's hardly unusual to hear a conservative charge that the Left dominates most media outlets, she nevertheless makes a compelling, and impassioned, case. The argument itself could probably have been made in four pages. The other 240 or so are exhaustive evidence (be sure to read the footnotes!)<br /><br />Most interesting to me were her discussions of the huge sales success of conservative books, in spite of their being boycotted by the \\"mainstream\\" media, and her analysis of the Left's frenzied attacks on their favorite, though, she argues, non-existent, whipping-boy, the \\"religious right.\\"<br /><br />By the end of the book, it's very clear that critics who charge Miss Coulter with hypocrisy for name-calling while accusing Leftists of name-calling have missed the central point she's trying to make. For her, the peppery characterization or zingy one-liner is a rhetorical device. For the Left, it's all they have: \\"Liberals don't try to win arguments, they seek to destroy their opponents and silence dissident opinions\\" (p. 91).<br /><br />While she has the diagnosis nailed, though, the weakness of this book is that the author fails to give us a prescription for dealing with it. She offers a suggestion (\\"As a start, one would have to cut out public schools, colleges, the evening news, sitcoms, movies, children's cartoons, book reviews, Lifetime: TV for Women, Katie Couric, Bryant Gumbel, People magazine, Vanity Fair, the New York Times, Time, Newsweek, and, indeed, all major newspapers and magazines\\" [pp. 116-7]), but never explains why she seems unwilling to go this route.  A large-scale Hoppean \\"strategy of personal secession\\" (Hans-Hermann Hoppe, [[ASIN:0765808684 Democracy: The God that Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy, and Natural Order]] Transaction, 2001) would seem to be just the ticket for leaving the Left nobody but themselves to talk to.<br /><br />In sum, \\"Slander\\" shows Ann Coulter has her mind around the essential problem.

Although the few Americans who bother to defend the idea are usually smeared as \\"neo-Confederates\\" or worse (is there anything worse?), a simple look at the last decade's headlines shows that secession is not only an idea, but an event, all over the world. From Quebec to Yugoslavia, the Baltic States to Chechnya, Scotland to Los Angeles, people are willing to defy the holy memory of St. Abraham Lincoln and \\"dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another.\\" Gordon and his contributors have rediscovered, dusted off, and re-articulated for a new century one of the most basic political rights of all, the right of self-determination.<br />A large portion of this collection of essays, as you might expect, examines the pre-eminent example of secession in American history, the Confederacy.  The three essays dealing with this period -- Joseph Stromberg's \\"Republicanism, Federalism, and Secession in the South, 1790-1865;\\" Thomas DiLorenzo's \\"Yankee Confederates: New England Secession Movements Prior to the War Between the States;\\" and James Ostrowski's \\"Was the Union Army's Invasion of the Confederate States a Lawful Act? An Analysis of President Lincoln's Legal Arguments Against Secession\\" -- form the core of the book.  However, this title is more than just an apologetic for the South. Philosophical, legal, and political analyses by other contributors provide a solid framework for secession as a political theory in our era as well.<br />The last essay, Bruce Benson's look at arbitration as an alternative to state-run judicial systems in commerce and trade, provides a true-life example of a type of modern individual \\"secession,\\" and recalls Mises' suggestion (quoted by several contributors) that the right to secession can ultimately be carried down to the community, home, and even individual level. Murray Rothbard reinforces this idea in \\"Nations by Consent: Decomposing the Nation State.\\"<br />This is a very important and valuable book, challenging as it does the accepted, post-1865 wisdom of Constitutional interpretation. Secession didn't die at Appomattox, either as a political theory or as a right inherent to each state in the American union. As several of the contributors note, secession (and the threat of it) is the single most powerful check on the expansion of federal power -- which, of course, explains why, from Lincoln on down, so many people have worked so feverishly to discredit it.  But truth is just truth, and no matter how hard the \\"enlightened\\" classes try to deny it, analyses like the ones in this collection show that a true idea cannot be silenced forever.n \\"Nations by Consent: Decomposing the Nation State.\\"<br />This is a very important and valuable book, challenging as it does the accepted, post-1865 wisdom of Constitutional interpretation.

Though the episode has largely passed from view today, the stench of \\"collaborated with the Nazis\\" still attaches to Switzerland's name in key parts of American media and culture. Angelo M. Codevilla gets to the bottom of this shameful episode in American history, and reveals what was really at stake and who stood to gain from it all.<br />As Codevilla shows, the anti-Swiss spasm in Congress and the media wasn't generated by any new facts or sudden revelations (despite what then-Senator Al D'Amato claimed at the time), but rather by domestic US political concerns and the Clinton Administration's typical desire to pay off wealthy campaign contributors. I suppose that, as a taxpayer, I should be relieved that for once, the money-grubbers set their sights on someone other than working Americans to be their easy-money cash cow. Like D'Amato, this whole sordid story makes me ashamed of my country -- but not for the same reason he gave.<br />Codevilla gives us chapter-and-verse of how the Clinton Administration put itself to work supporting campaign contributors' efforts to extort money, not from Swiss banks to give to Holocaust survivors, but rather from Swiss taxpayers to pour into their own tax-exempt foundations. He details the anti-Swiss game plan: dig up old and discredited arguments, rejected policy recommendations, and propaganda from American and Swiss left-wingers; clothe yourself in moral righteousness; wave the bloody shirt (Codevilla quotes one, \\"I speak to you today on behalf of the Jewish people.

W.G. Bean does an excellent job showing us why.<br />I first encountered Alexander Swift 'Sandie' Pendleton in Douglas Southall Freeman's essential 'Lee's Lieutenants,' in which he cites the need for a comprehensive biography of this important officer. A few years later (Freeman wrote in the 1940s, and 'Stonewall's Man' was first published in 1959), W.G. Bean -- appropriately, the Douglas Southall Freeman Professor of History at Pendleton's alma mater, Washington and Lee University -- took up the challenge. This is a sympathetic, but still thorough, look at the man 'Stonewall' Jackson 'loved like a son,' and Dick Ewell called 'the most promising young man' in the Army of Northern Virginia.<br />Pendleton was something of an intellectual, having graduated from Washington College (later W&L University) and entered the M.A. program at the University of Virginia when the War began. His quick and organized mind was ideally suited to the needs of a military staff, and he quickly made himself invaluable to Generals Jackson and Ewell. By the time of his death in 1864, shortly before his 24th birthday, he had risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and was assistant adjutant general (essentially, chief of staff) of the Second Corps.<br />Bean does a fine job of relating all this. He also doesn't skip on the equally important details of Sandie's personal life, particularly his romance with, and marriage to, Kate Corbin. This book is filled with excerpts from Sandie and Kate's personal letters, as well as those of their families and friends. By the time the book is complete, I felt I knew Sandie well, and, with his wife and family, genuinely mourned his untimely death.<br />Freeman said that part of his motivation in writing 'Lee's Lieutenants' was to rescue from obscurity some of the lesser-known commanders and officers of the Confederate armies. Today, when any acknowledgement (let alone defense) of the CSA is considered in some quarters a 'hate crime,' Freeman's mission is more important than ever. I'm very pleased, therefore, that 'Stonewall's Man' has been re-released, and urge its study by anyone interested in the Army of Northern Virginia. The staff corps, too, has its heroes, and Sandy Pendleton's is a life worthy of remembering and respecting.e's Lieutenants' was to rescue from obscurity some of the lesser-known commanders and officers of the Confederate armies.

With some of the caveats noted by other reviewers -- notably that the book skips over two-thirds of her time at the school -- I found this a very worthwhile read.<br /><br />I don't often get into \\"juvenile literature,\\" which is how this book is categorized. In fact, the last such book I read was [[ASIN:0060535202 Battle Dress]], Amy Efaw's fictionalized account of her first year at the US Military Academy, a title to which \\"In the Company of Men\\" bears certain obvious similarities. Some of the things other reviewers have considered lacking in this book -- insufficient legal context, not enough sociological analysis -- can, I think, be explained by looking at for whom Mace was writing. Having read Strum and Brodie about VMI, as well as Catherine Manegold's tendentious [[ASIN:0679767142 In Glory's Shadow: The Citadel, Shannon Faulkner, and a Changing America]], I too hope to see some of these issues addressed first-person on an adult level. But that's not to take anything away from this book.<br /><br />Nancy Mace's story is well written and inspirational. And though I understood the strong feelings and resentments many of The Citadel's alumni and friends bore about the (inevitable, in my opinion) decision to admit women, I was still shocked by the vehemence of the abuse she received -- especially from \\"the wealthy Charleston women who formed the backbone of Citadel social support,\\" known as South of Broads (referring to Broad Street), or SOBs. Mace considers the abbreviation apt, and I can't say I disagree with her. Similarly, the drunken alumnus who took it upon himself to personally berate Mace at every Citadel football game should be shamed into repentance and seclusion by her portrait of him (though I suspect he still considers himself a hero).<br /><br />At the same time, there's also a lot of humor in this story, as well as touching comradeship with (some of) her fellow cadets and a deep and reciprocated love for her parents. Mace may not address the larger question of why a young woman (or, for that matter, a young man) might want to attend The Citadel, but it's clear why *she* did: she loved her father, and she loves the school. I'd been looking for some time for a book that details the life and experience of a cadet at VMI or The Citadel, and here at last is that portrait. It's moving, challenging, and its target audience should, I hope, find it inspirational. I commend the author for writing the book, but more importantly for her determination to confront the challenges and emerge on top.personally berate Mace at every Citadel football game should be shamed into repentance and seclusion by her portrait of him (though I suspect he still considers himself a hero).

All the others grin and rave about whatever gets placed in front of them. But Tony isn't afraid to tell us, \\"that's the most disgusting thing I've eaten in my entire life.\\" That's why we love him.<br />Of course, unlike most of the TV chefs, Tony puts himself in positions where he has to eat disgusting things. That's the basic theme of this book, and he carries it off really well. Well beyond the \\"don't eat fish on Mondays\\" and \\"watch out for the hollandaise\\" revelations of \\"Kitchen Confidential,\\" \\"A Cook's Tour\\" isn't just a good book-about-food, it's a very good book in its own right. Tony might not value (or appreciate) the comparison to P.J. O'Rourke's \\"Holidays in Hell,\\" but as writers who can take awful places and experiences and make them downright funny to read about, these two have a lot in common.<br />I noted in my review of \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" that Tony's life was probably a lot more fun to read about than to have lived through (he might not agree with that), and that goes double for this title. Some of what Tony describes here is a little -- or more than a little -- squirm-inducing, while his travelogue of the road to Pailin was downright harrowing. Sensitive readers (as Miss Manners might say) should be aware that there are at least two graphic descriptions of the death of an animal intended for the cookpot -- though as he notes in his excellent section on his dinner with a bunch of vegans, not all killing is \\"murder,\\" and vegetarianism is a luxury of rich societies. People on the edge of survival literally can't afford to pass on the chicken strutting around their yard in order to await the arrival of expensive and out-of-season veggies.<br />Some critics have accused Tony of hypocrisy (or selling out) for having a TV show on the Food Network tied into this book when in the past he's said some fairly nasty things about celebrity TV chefs. But the filming of the TV program actually plays an interesting role in his book -- with Tony somewhat undermining his own program by revealing how often what's shown on screen differs substantially from his actual experience in a given location.<br />The chapter on \\"The Road to Pailin\\" -- a section in which food itself barely plays a role -- especially reveals Tony's chops as a writer. But other chapters, especially those on Southeast Asia, are quite well done too. I really enjoyed reading this, and if Tony chooses to put himself in harm's way again, you can be sure I'll be there to read about it.twork tied into this book when in the past he's said some fairly nasty things about celebrity TV chefs.

However, they haven't prevented her from giving us a comprehensive and fairly balanced look at the VMI case from start to ... if not finish, at least to the graduation of the first women to begin the school in the rat line.<br />One area where Strum's analysis is particularly strong is in tracing the history of anti-discrimination and equal rights law in the United States. She shows the jurisprudential evolution of the idea that, rather than women requiring special protection, all people are  entitled to the rights and benefits of equal citizenship, regardless of sex. Indeed, following the trend of relevant Supreme Court cases as the author lays it out for us, it's hard to see how VMI's defenders could have believed the Court would ever do anything *but* order the publicly-funded military academy to admit women on an equal basis.<br />But believe it they did, and Strum shows how the two sides in the case were arguing fundamentally different points: VMI, that tax-funded single-sex education served a public good, and the Justice Department that, whether single-sex education is good or not, public funding of it (VMI being a government school) is unacceptable under the 14th Amendment. Neither side seemed fully to understand the other, and Strum does a thorough job of showing how the two sides in many ways failed to confront one another's arguments head-on.<br />Strum frames VMI as a defender of outmoded stereotypes and anachronistic ways of thinking (notably the 'women-as-lady' myth, as she calls it). It's a portrait VMI's defenders no doubt resent, but it's clear that their focus on 'how men learn' versus 'how women learn' was based more on differences between men and women *as groups* than on what kind of system might be best for any given *individual*. After all, as Strum points out, if VMI's adversative system isn't right or attractive for most women, the undeniable fact (based on the number of male high school seniors who apply to VMI relative to their number nationwide, for example) is that it's not right or attractive for most men, either.<br />This brings us to some areas I wished Strum had developed further. Most interesting was her assertion -- based on circumstantial evidence -- that the Bush Administration (Bush I) must have blocked the Justice Department from arguing that VMI's treasured adversative system was unnecessary for molding the kind of citizen-soldier leaders that VMI exists to produce.  Certainly (as Ed Ruggero relates in 'Duty First: West Point and the Making of American Leaders'), the USMA ultimately decided its adversative system was actually counterproductive for that purpose, and so abandoned it. But Justice planted its flag on the (arguably weaker) ground that forcing VMI to admit women would not cause a fundamental change in the VMI system or ethos. The jury is still out about whether that's proven true.<br />Another question this book raised for me that Strum left entirely unaddressed was the appropriateness of cause-activists pursing their agenda on the bench. Specifically, Strum titles her chapter on Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 'The Advocate.' Justice Ginsburg (clearly the hero -- can we still say 'heroine'? -- of this book) spent her pre-Court career promoting a certain understanding of law and pursuing specific social and policy objectives. Once on the bench, judges assume a mantle of impartiality -- in exchange for which they enjoy the 'procedural consensus' Strum defines as the key to translating Court decisions into social change. And yet, Strum makes it clear that Ginsburg's jurisprudence in the VMI case was of a piece with her earlier work. Strum quotes another legal scholar describing the VMI decision as 'the vindication for [Ginsburg's] legal career ... the opinion she hoped the Court would one day arrive at when she first started arguing cases of discrimination in the 1960s' (p. 295). Is it right for judges (of any philosophical persuasion) to continue as advocates once they're on the bench? Public acceptance of that idea would seem to threaten the very 'procedural consensus' the advocates rely upon to achieve their goals.<br />That question aside, though, I enjoyed reading this comprehensive look at the VMI case. Despite clear indications of where she stands on the question, a few broad ideological brush strokes (conservatives are frequently described as 'angry'), and the occasional off-the-wall comment ('Nothing had been more central to the South than racism' [p. 102].) the author's presentation of both sides of this important case was, on the whole, equitable and balanced. As I said, it's hard to escape the conclusion that VMI's stand was doomed from the start. So long as government runs schools, they will be subject to the political process. And in 1996 as in 1864, VMI couldn't withstand the weight of Uncle Sam, no matter how much its defenders loved it, or how fervently they sacrificed to protect it.60s' (p. 295).

I mean, I understand why the simplicity and undoubted uniqueness of many of these recipes would appeal to housewives of the 1950s and 60s, trying to find some way to liven up their suburban ramblers come dinnertime. But still, Mary Margaret McBride's Link Loaf (p. 70), the Veal Ring Salad (p. 138), and the whole Cooking With Ketchup section (pp. 101-8) are just plain revolting. There are no two ways about it.<br />Still, there's no arguing about taste ... and I guess that applies as much to book reviews as to cooking. This book is entertaining (and disturbing) enough, but seldom did I find it really, really funny. The premise is pretty clear: find a photo of a disgusting piece of food and make self-consciously funny comments about it. Vary that by sometimes excerpting old cookbook or recipe copy, and then make self-consciously funny comments about that, too. Sure is cool to live in the sophisticated and ironic *now* instead of the dull and conformist *then*. It's a very MST3K approach to entertainment -- but as much as I dearly love MST, I'm not convinced the approach works equally well on every possible medium or subject.<br />Many reviews have pointed to the author's web site, where a great deal of funny material resides (I've been there too).  For some reason, it seems to work better there.	2002-07-22

This latest is dramatically better than the first, and so I am interested now in reading the rest of the titles in the series to see how the improvement progressed.<br />In this one, our nameless hero is in New Orleans on what should be a relatively straightforward affair: to verify whether an historic restaurant's chef's book (as distinct from a cookbook) being offered up for auction is the real deal. But someone else purchases the book before he can even see it, and the chase is on. This leads quickly to murder, and then to another murder, as well as to many, many lovingly described New Orleans meals and lots of coffee with chicory.<br />Many of the faults and idiosyncrasies I noted in 'The Gourmet Detective' have been weeded out of this title. Our hero is no longer comparing himself to every fictional detective ever published -- he has much more self-confidence now -- nor is he making us sit through long, descriptive passages detailing his every lunch and dinner (this doesn't contradict what I said in the last paragraph: here, the meals described have relevance to the story; before they felt more like space-filler intended to establish the hero's credentials as a gourmet). Most importantly, it's the detective's own skills that solve the mystery -- just what we'd expect in a mystery novel.<br />This isn't to say the story is perfect. There are still a few dots I'm not certain how he connected, even though I read the relevant passages several times over. On the whole, I still prefer Rick Riordan's atmospheric Tres Navarre series, set in San Antonio (one of the few American cities as interesting as New Orleans). But this one is growing on me, and I'm fairly certain I'll be looking up the other books in the Gourmet Detective series.	2002-07-19

This is a very, very good, and very, very important, book. It's also a strong argument for the author's elevation to the pantheon of pro-freedom writers and philosophers, alongside Mises, Rothbard, Spooner, de Jasay, and a select few others.<br />I have to admit that I found the first two chapters, especially, to be tough reading, and had to work through them several times. The economic analysis in the sections on time preference, for example -- while the outline of the argument becomes clear soon enough -- need extra time for all the shadings and implications to fall into place.<br />After that, though, the truly important work begins, as Hoppe is engaged in nothing less than (to use his own words from a slightly different context) &quot;an ideological campaign of delegitimizing the idea and institution of democratic government.&quot; In so doing, he undertakes a two-pronged approach of both demonstrating the failures of democracy (failures that are part of the very nature of democracy, and therefore irreparable) and the superiority of &quot;natural order&quot; -- a condition known by many other names too, including anarcho-capitalism and individualist or free-market anarchism.<br />Personally, I responded most strongly to Hoppe's argument that &quot;conservatives today must be antistatist libertarians and, equally important, [that] libertarians must be conservatives&quot; [p. 189]. In so arguing, Hoppe gives us a thorough and revealing deconstruction of modern &quot;conservatism&quot; (so-called), showing how many self-styled conservatives are in fact merely the right wing of social democracy. He convincingly links the Buchananites, on the other hand, to &quot;social nationalism or national socialism&quot; (p. 192). In either case, the neo-cons, the Buchanan brigades, and also the so-called Christian Right have, in Hoppe's eyes, &quot;not a trace of principled antistatism.&quot;<br />Libertarians shouldn't start feeling too smug, however. Hoppe also calls for principled antistatists to retake libertarianism from the &quot;lifestyle libertarians,&quot; who see antistatism as just one part of a comprehensive revolt against all social order and bourgeois culture (these folks were devastatingly described by Rothbard as &quot;modal libertarians&quot; or MLs -- a description Hoppe reprints in a footnote). He also targets &quot;left libertarians&quot; like the Cato Institute and Reason magazine, whose leading lights throw in the towel on the key question of State legitimacy, revel in the glamour and importance of life Inside the Beltway, and are reduced to arguing for reductions on the margin of an ever-expanding Leviathan.<br />Hoppe's final chapter, &quot;On the Impossibility of Limited Government and the Prospects for Revolution,&quot; expands on the philosophical basis for his earlier-defined strategy of personal secession. (It's important to note that Hoppe's &quot;revolution&quot; explicitly and firmly rejects violence: &quot;[I]t is not necessary to take [government] over, to engage in violent battle against it, or even to lay hands on one's rulers. In fact, to do so would only reaffirm the principle of compulsion and aggressive violence underlying the current system and inevitably lead to the replacement of one government or tyrant by another. To the contrary, it is only necessary that one decide to withdraw from the compulsory union and reassume one's right to self protection. Indeed, it is essential that one proceed in no other way than by peaceful secession and noncooperation&quot; [p. 91].)<br />This book now occupies a place of honor on my freedom bookshelf. But more than that, it's a reference I will return to (and already have returned to) often. To borrow from yet another review (Schumann's of Chopin, this time): &quot;Hats off, gentlemen -- a genius!&quot;!&quot;	2002-07-18

Peter King makes a noble attempt in this first entry in his by-now-long-running series. But while parts of the story were quite good, as a murder mystery, it was ultimately unsatisfying.<br />Like the Continental Op, our hero is unnamed. But he (like his creator, clearly) is a fan of detective fiction. Much of the book has an oddly self-aware quality, therefore -- especially when the hero and his Scotland Yard counterpart compare their interactions to those of famous fictional detectives and policemen. It's amusing at first to see the detective asking himself how Peter Wimsey or Charlie Chan would handle a certain situation, but even that begins to grow old after a while. Similarly, though it's refreshing that the author rejects the convention of the omnicompetent and almost omniscient sleuth -- the hero frequently complains that Holmes would have done a better job understanding a clue, or Travis McGee a difficult situation -- the solution to the crime, when it comes, struck me as in many ways unrelated to what our hero had been doing for the last 200 pages. Had I been following the wrong character around London?<br />Still, this is a fascinating concept, and not too bad for a first book. Certainly, the author knows his food (or at least, can snow an amateur foodie like me). I'm going to give some of the later titles in the series a try, and see if maybe things don't improve a bit over time.	2002-07-17

In place of the tired old orthodoxies of today's victim-feminism, the provocative, insightful, and energetic essays collected here reveal a feminism fit for the twenty-first century.<br />I admire Wendy McElroy a lot, and so particularly looked forward to her contributions to this collection. But the other writers she assembled are also quite good. I especially enjoyed the first three chapters, in which McElroy, Camille Paglia, and Richard Epstein lay the foundations of ifeminism. From there, different sections address ifeminism as it relates to sex, work, the home, violence and victim disarmament (aka 'gun control') and, finally, technology. Of the issue-oriented sections, this last one was particularly good. I especially appreciated Janis Cortese's 'The Third WWWave: Who We Are, What We See' -- a defiant, even angry, call to 'second generation' feminists to take this new, rising tide of ifeminists seriously.<br />Much of what you'll read here runs counter to received feminist wisdom: it's pro-market, pro-gun, anti-'comparable worth,' and profoundly skeptical about the evolution of sexual harassment law. It's pro-choice, but doesn't consider abortion a sacrament, as much of traditional feminism seems to. To borrow a too-often-paraphrased TV ad, this is not your mother's feminism.<br />Regardless of whether you're male or female, how you define feminism, or what your opinions of it may be, Wendy McElroy and her fellow contributors have outlined a new vision of feminism. It may well change the terms of debate entirely. Let's hope so.	2002-07-17

But nevertheless, I was able to enjoy this look at intriguing and often innovative designs for getaway living. The color photos are frequently beautiful, and the authors also helpfully include layout designs for the cabins' interiors as well as illustrations of how the cabins fit onto the owners' land. The text tells the stories of the individual cabins and their owners, and also has useful insights on the process of planning and building these kinds of structures.<br />People who have, or plan to have, getaway retreats of their own will probably find much inspiration, as well as many good ideas, here.

More than 15 years later, her photographs have been published as yet another of the many, many books commemorating the Academy's bicentennial.<br />Ms Lippman is a good photographer, and the photos in this book (all black and white) include some interesting explorations with light and shadow, the mass nature of life in uniform, and the like. The cover image, as well as several others, is almost Hitchcockian. The minimal text strives for a kind of High Art ethos that often seemed out of place with what was actually being shown (kind of like those NFL Films efforts to turn football games into modern Iliads).<br />Maybe I didn't take enough art appreciation courses in school, because as I looked at many of the images, my first response was to ask, 'What's going on?' There are a few pages of captions in the back of the book, but they're not always helpful (example: 31. Formation, Central Area). West Point graduates will probably be best able to understand what they're seeing, and maybe the images will be particularly evocative for them. But personally, I didn't feel compelled either to set this out on my coffee table, or to return to it again and again to absorb the masterful artwork. And apart from cashing in on the bicentennial, was there any particular reason to publish these images now, as opposed to fifteen years ago, or fifteen years in the future?	2002-07-15

In fact, that's probably the biggest impression I carry away from this book: it's very ... colorful. The text gives an adequate history of the US Military Academy, hitting on all the requisite high points: Thayer, Lee, Flipper, MacArthur, Eisenhower, Hollen, and so on. The images -- portraits, old maps, memorabilia from the USMA museum, etc -- decently illustrate the text (though the contemporary photos mixed in with the historic ones are sometimes rather *non sequitur* to what's being discussed). Among the great piles of books and videos that have been produced to observe West Point's bicentennial, I'm sure this picture book will be very popular. But I suspect it will mean more to people who didn't themselves actually attend the school. Those who did will find little that's new -- and despite the Academy's official cooperation with this production, may find the book too, well, glossy for their tastes.	2002-07-15

But while Johnson's focus has shifted, he nevertheless retains his eye for the big picture. And although the portrait he paints apparently outrages centralizers, collectivists, \\"reformers,\\" nationalists, and other acolytes of state power, there's no question Johnson has got the image just right.<br />Many reviewers have been horrified by Johnson's argument that Bonaparte, in style and substance, was precursor to Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, as well as countless smaller demons. And yet, as Johnson shows, the lineage is incontrovertible. Bonaparte's opportunism and determination to carve for himself a place in history (an ambition that so often costs the blood of innocents) ... the cult of personality built around the Leader, co-opting intellectuals, artists, and the church ... the *lev&eacute;e-en-masse,* and \\"people's armies\\" marching to spread revolution and \\"modernism\\" ... the mania to abolish local customs, traditions, and identities, and impose one centralized \\"national\\" authority ... secular rites modeled on religious ones (Johnson tells how Bonaparte's sister Pauline had servants ritually wash her feet before appreciative crowds of VIPs, a clear [if unconscious?] echo of Christ bathing the feet of His disciples) ... in all of these things and more, Bonaparte blazed the bloody trail followed later by so many others. Bonaparte's era was a monarchical one, and so he called himself Emperor. But he could just as easily have been F&uuml;hrer, Duce, Great Leader, Comrade Chairman, El Caudillo, or simply \\"the President.\\"<br />These Penguin Lives books are meant to be brief surveys of their subjects, and so serious students of Napoleonic history will no doubt find this book lacking in a lot of detail (for example, Johnson himself said he chose to skim over most of the tactical details of Bonaparte's battles). But what it lacks in specific detail, it more than makes up for in context and interpretation. If you don't object to that in your history-reading, I think you'll find this title takes a fairly short time to read, but gives you quite a lot to think about.les).

This high quality is just what I've come to expect from the scholars and writers at the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and if I could give this title six or seven stars, I would.<br />As in any collection of essays, some of the ones here assembled are better than others. Taken as a whole, though, they are a powerful indictment of how the increasing centralization of power in the office of the presidency has resulted in the destruction of America's heritage of individual liberty and decentralized government.  Some of the articles that struck me as particularly valuable (or just as fascinating reads) include:<br />* H. Arthur Scott Trask's study of Thomas Jefferson. This is one of the best attempts I've yet seen to grapple with the question, not only of whether Jefferson himself can justly be called a 'libertarian,' but also the specific issue of whether his two terms as president advanced or hindered the cause of liberty.<br />* Marshall L. DeRosa's 'Supreme Court as Accomplice: Judicial Backing for a Despotic Presidency.' While all three branches of government are to blame for the centralization of power in Washington, the Supreme Court has, at key points in history, been particularly destructive. DeRosa gives us chapter and verse.<br />* Randall G. Holcombe's 'The Electoral College as a Restraint on American Democracy.' This article goes beyond other analyses of the Electoral College in explaining how the Founders really intended the body to function, why it never did, and how it was early corrupted and twisted by the influence of party and faction.<br />* William Marina's excellent 'From Opponent of Empire to Career Opportunist: William Howard Taft as Conservative Bureaucrat in the Evolution of the American Imperial System.' In tracing Taft's career, Marina shows how foreign and domestic empire-building inevitably go hand-in-hand. This is an insightful and unexpectedly timely essay.<br />The two concluding essays, by Hans-Hermann Hoppe and Clyde N. Wilson, are also excellent summaries of the changing nature of the presidency and the likelihood, or lack thereof, for meaningful change. Other essays -- including those by Thomas J. DiLorenzo (of 'The Real Lincoln' fame), Ralph Raico, Joseph R. Stromberg, Jeffrey Rogers Hummel, and editor John V. Denson -- are of similar high quality. Space prevents me giving each of them the raves they deserve.<br />Each of these essays challenges the accepted hagiography of the presidency as an office, and of individual presidents as well. The men generally voted by historians as among our 'greatest' chief executives -- notably FDR, Lincoln, and Truman -- are proven in these pages to have been among the worst, most dangerous, and least worthy of canonization. The Mises Institute is never afraid to challenge the old orthodoxies (founder Lew Rockwell has called for the abolition of the office of the presidency altogether), and here they have done so, not only with skill and insight, but almost compulsive readability as well.<br />I have no hesitation, even now, in declaring this my Book of the Year for 2002 (it was published in 2001, but I'm a little behind in my reading). It's a bit of an effort to carry around, but it's definitely worth the exertion.an insightful and unexpectedly timely essay.<br />The two concluding essays, by Hans-Hermann Hoppe and Clyde N.

Rusher's \\"Rise of the Right\\" is a fascinating insider look at the rise to prominence of \\"the conservative movement\\" as many Americans understood it in the years from Goldwater to Reagan. The long-time publisher of [[ASIN:B00007AZXE National Review]], Rusher was one of the key forces behind the Draft Goldwater movement in the early '60s, and the Goldwater era occupies about a third of the book. From there, Rusher was also close to the early Reagan campaigns (1968 and '76), and many of the other key moments in the growth of conservatism as generally understood.<br /><br />As Rusher notes in his Introduction, his emphasis is on \\"the rise of the right\\" as a *political* movement -- as opposed to an intellectual/philosophical one. That ground, Rusher notes, was \\"ably described' in George Nash's 1976 work, [[ASIN:1933859121 The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945]].\\" As a result, Rusher doesn't spend a lot of time arguing the fine points of conservative doctrine. Instead, he takes us on a backroom tour of political campaign activism. I found this book an exciting read. Any political junkie, regardless of party affiliation, will probably get a kick out of some of the episodes recounted here.<br /><br />I first read this book around 1987, when I was a devoted Reaganite and a loyal reader of National Review. Rusher opened my eyes to the diversity of the conservative movement -- particularly the three main strands he identifies as the dominant forces in conservatism in the Cold War era: the Big Business types, the anti-communists, and what we would today call the Religious Right. I learned an awful lot reading this.<br /><br />However, I subsequently learned that Rusher wasn't telling me the whole story after all. The \\"Right\\" he describes here, while certainly the most visible subset of conservatism, isn't the whole story. It turns out that conservatism wasn't as discredited or moribund in the pre-Goldwater years as Rusher suggests -- though what we might call the \\"Buckleyite\\" wing Rusher belongs to has always tried to claim that it was. Though I would still recommend this book, I would encourage you to read it in context with, for example, Paul Gottfried's [[ASIN:0805738509 The Conservative Movement (Social Movements Past and Present)]] or Justin Raimondo's [[ASIN:1933859601 Reclaiming the American Right: The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement (Background: Essential Texts for the Conservative Mind)]].

Influenced no doubt by Anthony Bourdain's comments in 'Kitchen Confidential,' I've developed a little antipathy to celebrity chefs, with their catchphrases and signature lines of spices and kitchen equipment. At the same time, though, I keep finding myself drawn back to the cooking-themed TV network, where many of the chefs featured in this book find a home. For people who need to know whether Mario Batali is really from Italy or whether that hunky Bobby Flay is married, this is the book for you.<br />Despite the suggestion on the title page that this book gives us 'the dish on the stars of your favorite cooking shows,' there's nothing really gossipy or titillating here (maybe I'm misinterpreting what 'dish' means).  Instead, most of the chefs receive a brief biography-cum-conversation that explores their background, how they got into cooking and then onto TV, and their philosophy of food and food preparation. All personality-driven, there are no recipes or food-preparation tips in this book.<br />Whether you're a serious fan of a particular TV chef (they have some, apparently), or just someone who stumbled across a cooking show and wondered who this person mixing salad with their bare hands was, you'll probably find the things you're looking for here.	2002-06-20

Virginia is one of the most history-packed states (excuse me, Virginia is a Commonwealth) in the nation. There's a lot there to do and see. And this 'History &amp; Guide' is a valuable tool to have along as you visit it.<br />Some of the 'Where to eat' and 'Where to stay' information is obviously a little dated now. But the tremendous advantage this title has over the standard Fodor's guide doesn't change with time. Not only is it full of basic sightseeing info, but it also has engaging explanations of the historical importance of the various sights you're seeing. The illustrations by Stan Skardinski are unobtrusive, but nicely done.<br />The tourist from out-of-Commonwealth will find this a useful companion. And even longtime residents of the Old Dominion will find many worthwhile places and drives they may not have know about before. For a title that's 15 or more years old, that's not a bad deal.	2002-06-20

I'm not like that, which is what makes this book such an interesting and useful tool -- whether traveling here in Washington, or just browsing at home.<br />I mean, you gotta wonder: Is Humptulips as vaguely rude as it sounds? Who or what was Sedro Wooley? Who fought whom at Battle Ground? Did Startup get its name because that's where you 'start up' into the mountains (and what if you're coming the other direction)? And what about the whole Snohomish-Skykomish-Swinomish-Suquamish-Skokomish-Sammamish mess? This book is an excellent reference for getting to the bottom of it all. Not only cities and towns, but mountains, counties, rivers -- nearly everything with a name (except roads, bridges, and buildings) is listed here.<br />I do have to note, though, that although this book has been updated at least through the 1990s, it neglects to mention that King County, Washington, was 'renamed' in 1986. It no longer honors former US vice president William Rufus de Vane King, but is in fact now named after Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (this is true; you can look it up). Apart from that oversight, though, I recommend this title highly for people like me who can't help wondering why where they are, is what it is.	2002-06-14

And yet, for her entry in this series of 'travel' books, she leads us into one of the most magical and affecting places of all ... her own home.<br />This is an informal, light-hearted, and quick read (just two sessions in my Writer's Hammock in Seattle). And yet, it's also deeply moving. Morris describes all the facets of her converted stables -- a house in Wales, a Welsh house, a writer's house, and finally, a writer's house in Wales -- while meditating on life, death, history, culture, and the nature of friendship and hospitality. There's a lot packed between these covers!<br />As a book person myself, I responded most strongly to Morris' tour of her library -- a space chock full of art, music, and, of course, books. 'I have never counted the books in my own library,' she writes, 'but I would guess there are seven or eight thousand here, packed tight in their long white bookshelves, upstairs and down. I love them all, whatever their subject, whatever their condition, whatever their size. I love walking among them, stroking their spines. I love sitting on a sofa amongst them, contemplating them. I love the feel of them between my fingers, and I love the smell of them...' (pp. 101-2). She waxes just as lyrical about her kitchen, the stones of the exterior walls, the exposed wooden beams overhead ('marinated, so to speak, in age and hauled up here to my house to bless us all, like incense in a church' [p. 43]), the smell of smoke in the air, the view of the sea, even the poachers who steal onto her land to fish from her stretch of the river.<br />This book is like a hymnal. And while Jan Morris fans may be the readers most immediately attracted to it, anyone who responds strongly to a sense of place and a writer's connectedness to it will savor the hospitality and companionship of a warm and welcoming person in an equally welcoming home.in an equally welcoming home.	2002-06-12

And there's no shortage of life-in-pictures books, either. Of the later category, I have no hesitation in declaring that this one is the best. Any Churchillophile (and there are lots of us) should be sure to add this to his collection.<br />There are two primary reasons this title is so good. One is the vast number of photos collected between its covers. The second is the fact that the collector, and commentator, is Churchill's official biographer, Martin Gilbert, the man who arguably knows Churchill better than anyone now living (with the possible exception of his daughter, Lady Mary Soames). Not only is Gilbert's selection of photos excellent and illustrative, but his discussion of them is as well. As an accompaniment to the Official Biography, or any of the spate of other recent biographies, this book shouldn't be missed.	2002-06-04

In the broader fiction category, however, I can say that this is a decent semi-historical novel. The characterizations aren't the fullest, and the action is a little spotty. But the author himself is apparently highly regarded among Western writers, so I'm willing to give this one the benefit of the doubt.<br />The narrator of this first-person story is a young Texas man who has just joined the famed Texas Rangers in April 1875. The emotional and narrative center of the story, though, is \\"The Captain,\\" the true-life Ranger leader, Leander H. McNelly. Neither John Wayne nor Chuck Norris, Lee McNelly was few men's idea of a Texas Ranger, in his day or ours. A slight and sickly man, McNelly was a native Virginian and Confederate veteran who had studied to be a preacher. He came to Texas and served in the fledgling state police, and then was one of the first, and as it turned out greatest, Rangers ever. He was unimposing physically, but was absolutely ruthless when it came to enforcing the law. Our hero in this novel learns much from The Captain as their special force cleans up the Nueces Strip, a region of south Texas crawling with bandits and cattle rustlers.<br />McNelly is not the only drawn-from-real-life figure in this book. And without giving away any of the plot, I will say that several actual historical events, including parts of McNelly's own biography, intersect with the narrative at key points.<br />On the whole, I wasn't drawn into the book as deeply as I'd hoped. The narrator matures somewhat in the course of the novel, but still seemed somewhat detached from it all. And I found the climax (again, without giving anything away) disappointing. But that could all just be me. As I said, the author has won awards for his writing, so maybe I should give him another chance. And I probably will. But I have other things to read first.	2002-06-04

William Seymour takes us through several of &quot;history's greatest battles,&quot; including Hastings, Agincourt, Saratoga, Waterloo, Chancellorsville, and Anzio, and invites the reader at key points to select among several possible tactical options.<br />That description might make this title sound like one of those &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; books from childhood, but it really isn't. Instead of spinning out a &quot;counterfactual&quot; for each of the various options, Seymour explains why the commanders involved chose the option they did. He then analyzes the arguments for and against the other options and tries to determine what the likely outcome of each might have been. But then it's back into the stream of What Really Happened until the next key decision point.<br />This book won't displace Clausewitz or other staples of tactical training. But for the armchair general, it's probably worth a few hours to match wits with some of history's great commanders.	2002-06-04

As a result, many &quot;European&quot; cheeses sold in the US, Jenkins tells us, are pallid and bland -- if not downright heretical -- imitations of their European namesakes. If we want to try, for example, a &quot;real&quot; Camembert, we'll just have to wait until we get to France.<br />(Interestingly, Camembert cheese is not made in the village of Camembert, Jenkins informs us, nor is cheddar cheese made in the English town of Cheddar. Not any more, anyway. And needless to say, &quot;real&quot; cheddar cheese is apparently a very different thing from the mass-produced yellow bricks we find in our grocery store.)<br />The cover of this book describes Steven Jenkins as &quot;America's most opinionated authority&quot; when it comes to cheese, and I've no doubt that's true. His opinions do in fact come through loud and clear. As with any &quot;authority&quot; on matters of taste, you can give his opinions as much weight as you think they deserve. There's no question, though, that Jenkins is immensely informed about his topic. And if you feel a little self-conscious carrying this Primer to your local *cr&eacute;merie*, rest assured that it would still be easier than trying to memorize all the facts, tips, recommendations, and warnings the book contains.	2002-06-04

No, what Brookhiser attempts to do (as I believe he noted in 'Founding Father,' his book about George Washington) is reclaim the ancient idea of biography as a means of understanding and exploring ideas about civic virtue, citizenship, and (dare we say?) morals.<br />This isn't to say that Brookhiser whitewashes his subjects. Far from it: his subjects come through in this book both as sharply defined individuals and as members of a family with a very clear sense of itself and its place in history. That he chooses not to bog himself down in domestic minutia doesn't detract from the quality of the biography, and enhances the points he's trying to make.<br />If this book were a novel, cover blurbs would breathlessly proclaim it 'the sweeping saga of an American family across four tempestuous generations.' And the description wouldn't be far wrong. From the time of the Founding until the First World War, the Adams family was (to varying degrees at various times, but always to some extent) among the most prominent, influential, respected, and reviled families in America. Brookhiser does a fine job showing how four individual members of this family bore that inheritance, and shaped, and were shaped by, what it meant to be an Adams. If 'the contract of the [American] founding ... was a contract with their family' (p. 199), the family had contractual obligations in return. Many Adamses chose not to fulfill those 'obligations.' But the four who most notably did, did so with one eye on their times and the other on their patrimony.<br />The four biographies are fascinating in their own rights. But the section of the book I most enjoyed was the final four chapters, in which Brookhiser weighs one Adams against another and against some of the perennial questions of American civic life -- most notably the question of Republic versus Empire. It's here, especially, that Brookhiser shows how the lessons of the Adams dynasty apply to our own times as well as theirs.<br />The most obvious appeal of 'America's First Dynasty' is to students of political history. But it also bears reading for the light it shines on current political, constitutional, and cultural questions, and for the recurring dilemma of the family in American political life. For if the supermarket tabloids still label a certain other political/media clan as 'America's royal family,' it's worth remembering that they're not the first nor, by any stretch, the most important.

Bush	Books	4	6	10	N	N	'One of the most interesting presidents in decades'	One of the most persistent (and debatable) clich&eacute;s of the last nine months has been that September 11 'changed everything.' Whether it's really true that 'everything' has changed, it seems pretty clear, based on Frank Bruni's reporting, that George W. Bush, at least, has been transformed. That makes 'Ambling Into History' a particularly interesting -- as well as entertaining -- read.<br />Bruni's portrait of Bush is a fascinating one. And while it's not, perhaps, the deepest psychological analysis ever, it is clearly the work of a skilled observer and reporter. Bush comes across as a natural entertainer (not to say 'clown'), who wants to keep things lighthearted and amiable. Beneath it all, Bruni shows that Bush possesses a quick mind, a real awareness of his own limitations, and, related to the latter, a healthy sense of self-mockery.<br />What I found particularly interesting was Bruni's illustration of the various tensions at work within Bush himself. He wanted to be president, but he didn't have the all-encompassing, monomaniacal ambition of, say, an Al Gore or Bill Clinton. He knew he had to be on the campaign trail, but was positively homesick for his ranch in Crawford, Texas. He wanted to be thought of (and thought of himself) as a son of the West Texas oil patch, but seemed offended when people forgot that his education (Andover-Yale-Harvard MBA) was at least as good, and arguably better, than Gore's. Like so many sons of successful fathers, he had wrestled with his father's legacy his whole life. Now he had a chance not only to seize the same prize his father had, but to do so had to defeat one of the very men who had humiliated his father in 1992.<br />As much as this book is a study of George W. Bush, it's also memoir of the campaign trail. And its revelations about life on the bus are fascinating too. Particularly useful was Bruni's discussion of how much of the press coverage -- particularly of 'spats' and 'feuds' between candidates -- was driven by little more than bored reporters longing for something, anything, to write about.<br />Or his discussion of Bush allegedly being 'on the defensive' at one point late in the campaign: Gore was attacking Bush about something, and because Bush was willing to take reporters' questions, he responded to the attacks (Gore was never 'on the defensive' because he never spoke to reporters, and so never gave unscripted responses to anything Bush said). Bruni writes, 'the assertion that Bush was flailing was so rampant in newspapers and newscasts that it had transmogrified into the *fact* that Bush was flailing. It was the given, the starting point, from which every story now proceeded. It was true because almost every journalist, following a kind of groupthink endemic to campaign coverage, had decided that it was true and was reporting that it was true; because this was all Americans were reading, hearing, and likely to believe; and because the Bush campaign would therefore have to accept and react to it as true, making it all the truer. I wasn't sure if this logic was pretzel or circular, but I knew it was pathetic' (p. 165, emphasis in original).<br />This was repeated in the 'debate over the debates,' in which journalists reported that Bush was being 'hounded and hurt by questions' about his participation in proposed presidential debates. But the only 'hounding' was being done by those very same reporters, and the only evidence that Bush was 'hurt' by this 'hounding' came from ... the fact the reporters themselves were writing about it! 'We were, in essence, covering ourselves,' Bruni writes.<br />The latter stages of Bruni's book, particularly the epilogue, deal with Bush's surprising transformation in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Whereas during his first nine months in office he seemed anxious to deflate the imperial presidency (for example, he did away with the practice of playing 'Hail to the Chief' every time he entered a room, 'an homage that was like oxygen to President Clinton [p. 227]'), by November, he 'was amassing a degree of executive power that, in the eyes of some scholars, rivaled President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's during World War II' (p. 264-5). This transformation, in Bruni's mind, is 'turning Bush into one of the most interesting presidents in decades. He had indeed exceeded expectations, at least as an unusually riveting character in a newly compelling drama' (p. 265).<br />This book didn't match up to the hyperbolic reviews, either pro or con. It did raise questions for me about some of the workings of President Bush's mind -- or at least how those workings express themselves in his words -- but it also revealed a human and fundamentally likeable guy: a guy whose most likeable characteristic of all was that he was never entirely convinced he even wanted to BE president.to President Clinton [p. 227]'), by November, he 'was amassing a degree of executive power that, in the eyes of some scholars, rivaled President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's during World War II' (p. 264-5).

I was fortunate to spend about half my pre-college years in Hawai`i, nearly all of which time coincided with the three terms of Hawai`i's longest serving elected governor, George R. Ariyoshi. And so although he and I have some significant political and philosophical disagreements, I enjoyed this chance to learn a little more about a man who was always something of a feature of my early life, and put some vaguely remembered controversies into better focus.<br /><br />Like all memoirs (especially ones by politicians) there are self-serving elements to this book that make it worth reading with a grain or two of salt. At the same time, though, Governor Ariyoshi's focus really isn't on refighting old battles (in fact, I wish he'd gone into a little *more* political detail than he did). Instead, he's more interested in examining how his background as the son of Japanese immigrants, but born and raised in the unique political and cultural setting of Hawai`i, colored his worldview and approach to public service. &#34;Warm&#34; and &#34;human&#34; are the sorts of words reviewers always use for books like this, and I think they apply here. This is an interesting, informative, and at times, touching, book.<br /><br />This book reveals some fascinating contradictions, not only in Hawai`i's political world, but also in Ariyoshi himself. For all his focus on compromise, moderation, agreement, planning for the future, and so on, Ariyoshi is an intense partisan. He is a loyal Democrat Party man, and his references to the Republicans are almost always derogatory. Toward the end of the book, for example, he describes the work of &#34;transform[ing] Hawai`i from a politically backwards territory to a progressive, multiracial state,&#34; as &#34;the most essential accomplishment of the Democratic Party&#34; (p. 200), as though social progress can only occur through the hand of government, and even then only if that hand is Democrat.<br /><br />That brings us to an issue I wish Ariyoshi had addressed more directly -- an issue that is, in fact, the central fact of political life in the Fiftieth State: the state is ruled (it's not too strong a word) by an &#34;iron triangle&#34; of Big Labor, Democratic Party politicians, and a bloated State bureaucracy. Ariyoshi admits (p. 199) that Hawai`i is essentially a one-party state, but --typically, though not entirely incorrectly -- blames the GOP for their own irrelevance.<br /><br />He breezily dismisses criticisms of Hawai`i's regulate/socialize/bureaucratize/tax tradition as &#34;continental modes of thinking&#34; (p. 126), without explaining why a free market is somehow unsuited for the Island State. Indeed, he notes that &#34;In Hawaii we have a tradition of highly centralized government that can be traced to Kamehameha's wars of conquest and the formation of the Hawaiian kingdom&#34; (p. 128)  -- an argument that reduces to little more than &#34;We do it this way because we've always done it this way.&#34; Throughout the book, whether he is addressing the 1970s energy crisis, economic development, affordable housing, diversification of agriculture, limiting the adverse impact of tourism and &#34;in-migration,&#34; and the rest, the solution always -- always -- involves government.<br /><br />In short, *otagai* -- &#34;We are obligated to one another&#34; -- may well be true. But why that obligation needs to be met through the coercive force of government is a linkage Governor Ariyoshi leaves largely unaddressed. At one point, he quotes Lao Tsu that &#34;A leader is best when the people hardly know he exists, and of that leader the people will say when his work is done that 'We did this ourselves.'&#34; (p. 96). Ariyoshi takes this to mean leaders should draw people in and get them involved in a common effort. But I always interpreted it to mean &#34;leaders&#34; should, to the greatest extent possible, leave the people unmolested in the first place. That way, &#34;we did this ourselves&#34; becomesliterally true, and not an illusion used to camouflage the acts of the &#34;leaders&#34; themselves.<br /><br />Apart from these philosophical differences, though, I genuinely enjoyed reading this book. It brought back many memories for me, and more to the point, gave many valuable insights on both the process and the potential of political leadership. Low as my opinion of career politicians tends to be, I have to admit that if more of them were motivated by the kinds of ideals described on these pages, the act of politics might well be a less nasty thing.

Because I consider myself such a dilettante in so much of what I do, I have a lot of respect for people who are absolutely focused, to the point of monomania, on achieving greatness in what they do. Working in a Bourdain-run kitchen would be easy: all you have to do is be invariably punctual, absolutely reliable, committed to the same high standards he is ... and then work yourself to death to achieve them.<br />Bourdain's story is entertaining, fast-paced, profane, funny, iconoclastic (at least if you like celebrity TV chefs), revealing, occasionally nauseating, deeply personal ... and probably a lot more fun to read about than to have lived through. You won't look at restaurant food the same way again. Sure, you may be more suspicious about what it is you're really being served. But more importantly (to Bourdain anyway, I suspect), you'll have greater understanding and respect for the people who prepared it. The seamy underside of the restaurant world is the most headline-grabbing part of the book, but the real value comes from the author's own experiences, his revelation of the life of an NYC chef, and his obvious love of great food prepared well.<br />At the same time, though, it seemed to me like there's a little bit of bait-and-switch to it. Bourdain spends the whole book talking about the manic, hard-rock, drug-driven, frenetic, foul-mouthed, take-no-prisoners world of the professional chef, laying it all on the line for us: this is what it's really like. And then, in one chapter, he pulls the rug out from under himself with his profile of Scott Bryan, another New York chef who, Bourdain admits, is night-and-day different from our author, and also more knowledgeable, more respected, and more successful. It's to his immense credit that Bourdain is absolutely up front with us about why Bryan is a three-star chef and he isn't.<br />I plan to read Bourdain's other non-fiction work and his two novels. This soul-baring book has put Anthony Bourdain on my list of authors I definitely plan to keep an eye on.y Bourdain on my list of authors I definitely plan to keep an eye on.	2002-05-06

Along with 'anti-Semite' and one or two other smear words, to label someone an 'isolationist' is to paint him in colors that will never entirely wash away. To be an 'isolationist,' an 'America-Firster,' is to be xenophobic, head-in-the-sand, economically illiterate, and politically a reactionary mossback, a shirker of America's undoubted responsibilities to the rest of the world, and probably a crypto- (or not so crypto-) fascist.<br />That many on the Right as well as the Left unquestioningly use the term in just this way reflects not only on the sorry state, and narrow limits, of 'acceptable' political debate, but also the way American history has been cheapened and distorted for political purposes. That's what makes Justus Doenecke's impressive history all the more important.<br />With intricate and painstaking documentation, Doenecke shatters the latter-day myth of who the 'isolationists' (Doenecke prefers the less loaded term 'anti-interventionists') were, and what they stood for. As the clock ticks down to Pearl Harbor, we see the incredible diversity of the anti-interventionist bloc, who agreed on keeping America out of the war, but on little else. Learned and articulate people from every part of the political spectrum opposed intervention. Some anti-interventionists were outright pacifists who opposed any military spending, while others were '100% for arming to the teeth for defense of this country' (as the New York Daily News described Thomas E. Dewey, quoted on page 158). Some denied National Socialist Germany posed any threat to America, while others feared an invasion, via South America or Canada, was imminent. Many were strongly anti-Nazi, while others seemed to believe the longer-term threat to peace came from Imperial Britain. Some wholeheartedly supported the 'bases for destroyers' deal with the UK, but others vehemently opposed it. Some few were indeed anti-Semitic, but most were not, and a few opposed aid to Poland in 1939 explicitly because of Poland's own history of anti-Semitism. And so on.<br />After Pearl Harbor, anti-interventionists remained divided -- on FDR's degree of culpability, for example. But they were virtually unanimous in calling for an immediate declaration of war against Japan. The time for anti-interventionism had ended, and the America First Committee dissolved itself within days (declaring, as it did, that 'Our principles were right. Had they been followed, war could have been avoided.').<br />In short, the one-dimensional caricature of 'isolationists' we're treated to today has little basis in reality.<br />Doenecke's research is truly impressive. When I first opened this book, I was surprised at how small the type was. But then I realized that literally the final third or so of the text is all endnotes, references, and bibliography, and that was what I had opened to. The author of several histories of anti-interventionism before and after the Second World War, Doenecke's familiarity with the relevant sources is unsurpassed.<br />But Doenecke's not just a skilled researcher. He's also a fine writer. His narrative is fast-paced and engrossing. Most usefully, while he's recounting the on-the-one-hand/on-the-other-hand positions the anti-interventionists took, he doesn't comment on which position turned out to be historically 'right.' Only in the excellent Conclusion does he weigh the merits of the different arguments, and the anti-interventionist position generally.<br />As with any group of diverse and opinionated humans, there's good and bad, right and wrong, in what the anti-interventionists said, and what they stood for. It's hard to dispute, though, that there's much we can learn from the principled stand these men and women took. As Doenecke notes, for example, they had a healthy skepticism of Presidential power, were keenly aware of geopolitical reality (including the threat posed by the Soviet Union), powerpolitics, and of how engagement in wars abroad inevitably swells the size and power of the State at home.<br />In these days of a new war, when some commentators explicitly call for America to embrace its alleged role as Global Empire, this book is exceptionally important reading. As important as grasping 'Why We Fight' is an understanding of why, sixty-plus years ago, so many people tried so hard to keep America from having to do so.politics, and of how engagement in wars abroad inevitably swells the size and power of the State at home.<br />In these days of a new war, when some commentators explicitly call for America to embrace its alleged role as Global Empire, this book is exceptionally important reading.

A Statement of the British case (Collected Works of Arnold Bennett)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Instructive for what it's not saying	Arnold Bennett (1867-1931) was a British novelist, essayist, journalist, and playwright. Though not so well remembered -- at least on these shores -- as many of his contemporaries, it's not for want of effort, since he published something like 30 novels.<br />When World War One began in 1914, Bennett was summoned -- along with other key British writers like Doyle, Hardy, Galsworthy, Belloc, Chesterton, Wells, and others -- to become part of what became known as the War Propaganda Board. This little book, the first of Bennett's two efforts for the WPB, was first published within months of the war's beginning, initially in the Saturday Evening Post, and then as a book on the Hodder & Stoughton imprint (the secretive WPB didn't publish under its own name, and its activities weren't revealed to the public until the 1930s).<br />The piece is instructive, not so much for what it tells us about British war aims, but for what it reveals about wartime propaganda.<br />The book has many of the clich&eacute;s of the time -- arrogant Prussian aristocrats, docile German masses, 'the sinister Krupp family,' 'the monstrous chicane of the military caste against the people.' But at the same time, it is reserved, intellectual, and almost gentlemanly propaganda as compared to what came later in the war (lies about Belgian babies tossed in the air and skewered on German bayonets, and so on). In the second war, Churchill could quote an anonymous saying, 'The Hun is always at your throat or at your feet.' But here, instead of those later efforts to blame both wars on a pathological evil within the German people themselves, Bennett points the finger squarely at 'the grandiose German military legend, fostered by the German military caste and in turn by repercussion exciting that caste to a fury of arrogance.'<br />Bennett's tone becomes somewhat more fire breathing in the third and final chapter. But strangely, the 'Liberty!' so prominent in the title really appears only in the last paragraph, where he argues that the British have no desire to live as German slaves. As was typical at the time, his emphasis is much more on Britain as a state, honoring its commitments to France and Belgium, than on the ancient liberties of individual British men and women.<br />This is an interesting little tract, in all. The writing is unremarkable (as government war propaganda so often is). But as a window into the official British mindset at the start of the Great War, it's a useful little addition to the historian's shelf.here he argues that the British have no desire to live as German slaves.

That tongue-twisting question is at the center of this book, which relates science's attempt over the centuries to figure out where exactly to place the platypus, one of God's most wondrous (and confusing) creations, on the org chart of life. Central to the taxonomic mystery was the question of whether the platypus lays eggs (is &#34;oviparous,&#34;), gives birth to live young (&#34;vivi-&#34;), or, like some lizards, hatches eggs within its own body (&#34;ovovivi-&#34;).<br /><br />High school biology is not an episode I'm anxious to relive, but Ann Moyal does a good job in this little book of keeping matters from getting too complex. What she wasn't able to do, unfortunately, was keep the middle of the book from dragging somewhat. After several chapters relating scientists' struggles and competing theories on the ovi/vivi question -- and related matters like nipples, sex organs, and the like -- I was more than ready to skip to the end in hopes Holmes or Poirot or someone would step forward and reveal the solution to the puzzle.<br />Things got really interesting again in the final three chapters, where Moyal introduces us to a self-taught biologist known as &#34;The Platypus Man&#34; (not to be confused with the TV show by that name: [[ASIN:B00QFBC024 Richard Jeni: Platypus Man]]), to Winston, a platypus who traveled to England to help fight World War Two, and -- most importantly -- to the latest developments in platypus studies. I picked up this book in order to find out more about the platypus, not because taxonomy or the history of natural science are big interests of mine, and so I found these final chapters the most entertaining and rewarding in the book.<br /><br />In 1839, the Tasmanian Society of Natural History adopted the platypus as its emblem, and added the motto &#34;Quocunque aspicias hic paradoxus erit&#34; -- From wherever you look at it, this will be a paradox. Ann Moyal's book shows how men have sorted out the paradox, and lets us benefit from centuries of effort to know this reclusive, fascinating, and mysterious little creature a little better.benefit from centuries of effort to know this reclusive, fascinating, and mysterious little creature a little better.	2002-04-18

Turns out it is that (especially in the thumbnail reviews of the films themselves), but it's also much more.<br />Today, in our enlightened 'post-modern' era, it's easy to laugh at the staid and conformist world these films both illustrate and reinforce. Yet, as Ken Smith argues, the filmmakers didn't set out either to produce comedy or to crush their children's souls. 'The people responsible for these films were driven by a sincere desire to guide young people toward behavior that they felt would make them happy. It's no fun to be lonely or physically unattractive. Nor is it enjoyable to be a heroin addict or have your face torn off in a car wreck' (p. 13).<br />Moreover, 'they [the films] were made by some of the most liberal and progressive-minded people of their time. Their goal was noble: to help children become well adjusted, happy, and independent (within limits). The films look corny and manipulative to us today, but not because the people who made them were evil and stupid' (p. 30).<br />All this to say, this book's not only entertaining, but is also an insightful sociological study of the attitudes and ideals of these films' era. The section on the genres of films is fascinating, though I also found myself nauseated by some filmmakers' practice of showing actual, bloody, mangled accident victims in some highway safety movies. That one is a particularly sobering chapter.<br />Once that's out of the way, though, it's on to the rollicking fun as Smith deconstructs 250 or so of these films, including several recognizable to any MSTie. Here, for example, is part of his description of 'Developing Your Character,' a 1950 offering from mental-hygiene powerhouse Coronet Films: 'Joe, a squinty-eyed, perpetually smiling future politician, \\"likes people,\\" Bob explains. He \\"wants to be friends with everybody\\" and is \\"sincere and real.\\" Joe quickly becomes the leader of a gang of happy teens who are all slavishly devoted to his welfare. With their help, he places first in the statewide Junior Citizenship essay contest -- and wins a trip to the state capital for a week. \\"Actually, we all won,\\" says Bob, exhibiting the team spirit that will make him a fine, faceless corporate drone in the years to come' (p. 137).<br />I'm glad to have read the book, and even more thankful I never had to sit through these films in school.wants to be friends with everybody\\" and is \\"sincere and real.\\" Joe quickly becomes the leader of a gang of happy teens who are all slavishly devoted to his welfare.

If, as certain types of people never tire of reminding us, 'the United States is a republic, not a democracy,' it's legitimate to ask just how much attention the shifting winds of 'public opinion' really deserve. In fact, the Founders devoted much time and ink to this question, and our Constitution was devised with a number of mechanisms for insulating government from fickle populism. As Matthew Robinson makes clear in this important book, though, things have changed tremendously. And not for the better.<br />As Robinson describes it, a number of mutually reinforcing factors are at work here. For one thing, the American people don't know their civics very well (to put it mildly). 'Almost six in ten Americans, 59 percent, think the president, not Congress, has the power to declare war. Thirty-five percent of Americans believe the president has the power to adjourn Congress at his will. Almost half, 49 percent, think he has the power to suspend the Constitution. And six in ten think the chief executive appoints judges to the federal courts without the approval of the Senate (p. 189-190).' Opportunistic politicians and a media obsessed with the short term exploit this ignorance to promote, Robinson argues, left-wing political agendas and demonize those people and ideas of whom they disapprove.<br />The classic example of this, he says, was the Clinton impeachment debate, in which the American people apparently were persuaded that removing a president for high crimes and misdemeanors would constitute a 'coup' 'overturning the election' (an argument the Clintonites reinforced because their own polling showed it was working) -- as though Bob Dole and not Al Gore would somehow become president. For craven politicians, the fact that Clinton still had 'high approval ratings' was enough to justify acquittal. Thus did polling by partisan media trump law, morality, and the Constitution.<br />Robinson's book is well written, and covers many of the important bases. I was a little annoyed by the book's E-Z To Read design, with lots of headlines and subheads, pull quotes, and special formatting for poll questions and other highlights. But I know it improves 'readability,' and maybe that's what you need to do in order to get the Mob Robinson describes to keep reading.<br />As others have, I would suggest reading this alongside Bernard Goldberg's book, 'Bias.' The two of them are enough to make anyone swear off the American media altogether. Maybe we can spend our free time reading The Federalist (or better yet, Hans-Hermann Hoppe's 'Democracy: The God that Failed') instead.annoyed by the book's E-Z To Read design, with lots of headlines and subheads, pull quotes, and special formatting for poll questions and other highlights.

Judges, as a class of humanity, have always seemed to me to embody the worst aspects of lawyer, priest, and politician, all rolled into one self-important package. One of the few judges who have ever seemed worth much is Richard A. Posner, author of this fine and devastating book. Millions of gallons of ink have been spilled over the 2000 election, but Judge Posner may be the only author who brings both a dispassionate eye and an almost unmatched legal mind to the vexed constitutional and legal issues involved.<br />The result, as a whole, doesn't do much for the reputation of Judge Posner's legal brethren, especially the members of the appropriately nicknamed SCOFLA, or Supreme Court of Florida. As Judge Posner deconstructs the logic -- for lack of a better term -- employed by the Court in Bush v. Gore, you'll be left wondering what in the world they were thinking.<br />If this book makes anything clear, it's that the Left is correct to call the U.S. Constitution a 'living document.' It lives in the same way the Frankenstein monster 'lived,' as a monster formed by two centuries -- or at the minimum 70 years -- of 'progressive' jurisprudence. The crowning glory of this, as Judge Posner makes clear, may well be the performance turned in by SCOFLA in 2000.<br />This book wrestles with important issues, but it is well written and extremely readable. The final two chapters -- 'Critiquing the Participants' and 'Consequences and Reforms' -- lift this book beyond the many 'instant histories' we've seen of the 2000 election and make it something well worth studying by people on every (or no) side of the question. The legend of the 'stolen election' has already entered the Left's mythology, up there with 'Reagan's massive budget cuts' and 'impeachment was all about sex.' It would be nice if this excellent book could help us get beyond the partisan grousing so we could address more important issues. But I don't think it's gonna happen.	2002-04-02

We've come a long way from 'the bunny runs around the tree and goes into the hole.'<br />In fact, however, the guides are not only quite easy to follow (although there's still a certain amount of practice required to perfect the knots), but Fink and Mao are good about describing which knots work best with various types of ties, collars, and faces.<br />Now I look at this book like I do those glossy cocktail books, full of enticing photos of multi-colored drinks. Those make me want to work my way down the bar, and this made me wish I worked someplace where I could wear a tie more often, just for the joy of experimenting with the knots. Well, almost, anyway.<br />At any rate, any man who fancies himself a stylish dresser (or at least one who doesn't take his fashion cues from Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis) should keep this handy little guidebook next to his gold collar pins and framed photo of Fred Astaire.	2002-04-02

It's an extremely comprehensive look at the topic, with sections on everything from risk analysis to the roles of various state and federal agencies. It also scores high on Buzzword Bingo -- featuring not only the title phrases 'weapons of mass destruction,' 'asymmetric,' and 'homeland' (who ever used that term prior to September 11?) but other current insider jargon like jointness, CBRN, proxies, and learning curve. Civil and military aspects of the 'homeland defense' question are all thoroughly covered.<br />If there is a deficiency, it's in discussing the larger context in which attacks are likely to occur. Cordesman posits a world in which threats exist, and the decision-maker has to prepare for, detect, counter, and respond to them. What's missing is an analysis of why threats exist in the first place -- in the plaintive wail of the headline writers, 'Why do they hate us?' Might not finding ways to get 'Them' to hate us less be an element of 'homeland defense' as well? Assessing HOW we're at risk without also figuring out WHY strikes me as akin to trying to fix a leaky bathtub without first turning off the faucet.<br />But within the narrower focus of Cordesman's book, he does a very thorough job. I can imagine this title showing up on a lot of desks in Washington, D.C., and that's probably a good thing.	2002-04-02

The gravedigger of the U.S. Constitution, Lincoln buried the founders' Union as completely as Lenin buried the Romanovs. And like Lenin, Lincoln built an empire on bayonets, brutality, and centralized power. As historian Richard Bensel (quoted by Thomas DiLorenzo in the introduction to this book) wrote, any student of the American state should begin his reading with 1865. Whatever happened before then no longer has any relevance.<br />DiLorenzo's little book began rocking conservative and libertarian circles even before its publication, proving what someone once said, that the way to tell the difference between the two schools of thought is to ask them what they think about Lincoln. To the outrage of the fans of centralized government, DiLorenzo is not only an excellent writer but a skilled researcher too. Votaries of Saint Abraham's iconic image have an awful lot of 'splainin' to do. In fact, as DiLorenzo notes, much of the writing on Lincoln over the decades has been exactly this: historians rationalizing Lincoln's decidedly un-godlike words and deeds. Whether a reader is willing to see through this fog depends on how open she is to challenging established 'truths.'<br />Lincoln's defenders often employ the slander that criticizing the Great Emancipator is the moral equivalent of defending slavery.<br />But history shows that slavery ended around the world during that era, and no place required the bloody war Lincoln waged. DiLorenzo proves that throughout his life, up to and including the War, Lincoln's driving force was his devotion to Henry Clay's 'American System' of internal improvement, nationalized banking, and a powerful central government. As DiLorenzo shows, a confederacy of states exercising their (previously unquestioned) right to secession would have been an intolerable obstacle to Lincoln's driving ambition.<br />DiLorenzo also catalogues Lincoln's wartime offenses against the Constitution, the people (North and South alike), the Southern states, and the very 'Union' he was allegedly trying to save. If for no other reason than Lincoln's deliberate strategy of waging war against civilians -- DiLorenzo shows that the policy came straight from Lincoln's own hand -- it's hard to deny historian Lee Kennett's conclusion (quoted on page 197-198) that a victorious Confederacy would have been entirely justified in executing Abraham Lincoln for crimes against humanity.<br />Most damning to the modern myth of Lincoln as a man tormented by America's original sin of slavery, DiLorenzo shows that the Great Emancipator never in his life accepted the fundamental equality of all persons. Until his death, he denied that free African-Americans could be assimilated into the US population. His solution was to 'return' all blacks, even native-born ones, to their 'homeland' of west Africa, or exile them to the Caribbean or Central America.<br />Like the statue in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, Abraham Lincoln's towering reputation stands on feet of clay, propped up by generations of myth-making, political opportunism, and -- yes -- lies. But nothing so fundamentally flawed can long endure. Toppling the Lincoln of myth is essential not only for recovering the promise of America's founding, but also for healing the social fractures spreading since his death.

Contributors to this collection include: Bill Clinton's secretary of defense; Bill Clinton's national security advisor; a raft of folks from Bill Clinton's National Security Council; Bill Clinton's hand-picked chairman of the Joint Chiefs and his Supreme Allied Commander, Europe; and the chairman of Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors. If one thing is clear, even from reading just the table of contents, it's that the answer to the title question won't involve pointing many fingers at America's forty-second president.<br />And it turns out it doesn't. As befits Foreign Affairs magazine, which assembled the essays published here, the contributors are all pillars of the Foreign Policy Establishment (can you get more ubiquitous than Brian Jenkins?). Consequently, few of the analyses or recommendations venture far from what you'd find on the New York Times op-ed page.<br /><br />I thought the first four essays were the best in the book.  They analyzed the September 11 terrorists themselves, the Middle Eastern culture whence they sprang, and the impact of America's quest for a Pax Americana. Once the focus turned from history and sociology to defense and counter-terrorism strategies, the voice of Conventional Wisdom was clearly recognizable.<br />Sandy Berger's offering is typical: 'First, we must dismantle and destroy the terror groups arrayed against us, and their support systems, using every tool at our disposal, including military force. In so doing, we must use that force in a way that isolates the extremists without isolating us. ... Second, we must bring more of our diplomatic, political, intellectual, and economic energy to the Islamic world ... Third, we must actively seek to reverse the spiral of violence in the Middle East...' (p. 126-127). It says so much, and yet so little.<br />In the next essay, William Wechsler argues that President Clinton did the right thing in targeting the Al Qaeda financial structure, and that President Bush needs to keep doing it, and also start doing it again. The bad guys here, it turns out, were Phil Gramm and Paul O'Neill, who failed to recognize the wisdom of the Clinton approach.<br />Another theme runs through these latter essays too. 'The U.S. government needs more power to (Wechsler, p. 142) ... the key for [Tom] Ridge will be budgetary authority (Nye, p. 206)  ... devote more funding to intelligence and law enforcement programs (Perry, p. 237) ... there simply wasn't enough money in the defense budgets (Clark, p. 246)' ... and on, and on. A nice contrast was Richard Betts' clear-eyed piece about the U.S. intelligence community, its 'failures' in the war against terrorism, and what the American people can and legitimately should expect from our intelligence agencies.<br />In all, there is some good background and historical material here, and a few insights into establishment thinking on terrorism and how to deal with it.

('Mike') Nelson first soared to international super-stardom in the galactic mega-hit TV show 'Mystery Science Theater 3000,' in which men and bots made fun of bad movies. Striking out on his own, Mike then rocked the world with 'Movie Megacheese,' a collection of essays in which he ... made fun of bad movies. And now, Mike boldly draws us out of our comfort zones with 'Mind Over Matters,' in which he makes fun of (and this is important) things that *aren't movies*!<br />And he does it really well.<br />I was a little nervous at first. Movies, after all, exist to be criticized. It makes sense for them to be reviewed. But why would someone sit down and write a short article about meat? Or deconstruct a trip to Radio Shack or an afternoon moving a buddy's couch? Because they're funny, that's why.<br />I found myself laughing aloud almost from the very beginning. I had to hide my head under a pillow when I read the line about 'eating women and chasing grapes,' so as not to wake my sleeping bride. Mike's analysis of the Fonz, from TV's 'Happy Days,' was hilarious -- but also an insightful puncturing of an inherently implausible TV premise ('I never believed the Fonz could beat up a wood duck, let alone the much larger thugs he often bested or frightened away with lackluster feints.'). The description of a college English professor in 'Did He Say &quot;Meep&quot;?' was unforgettable, and 'Yes, I Have Never Been Mellow' was a moving ode to the Seventies.<br />With this book, Mike Nelson moves beyond the 'any MSTie will love this' category and into the larger (and I hope more remunerative) one of 'any humor fan will love this, period.' Way to go, Mike. We knew you could do it.	2002-03-25

I was really disappointed by this book. As a history-reader, the Habsburg monarchy during the era covered by this title has always been one of my particular interests. As Robin Okey himself notes in his Foreword, general surveys of Austro-Hungarian history are rare -- particularly in English. I picked this volume up with great anticipation.<br />Unfortunately, I set it down again fairly quickly, and found it hard to resume reading. I wouldn't have thought he could do it, but Okey made me reluctant to read about one of my greatest and longest-standing historical interests.<br />The problem isn't that the book is poorly researched, badly written or tendentious in argument. On the contrary, it's so incredibly well researched that I had to wonder for whom it was written. For page after page, Okey goes really, really in depth on agricultural production statistics, analyses of economic growth, ethnological comparisons of literary and linguistic developments, political tensions between various nations and regions in the empire, the relative states of national aristocracies ... and much, much more. I now understand, better than ever before, what that old saw about 'the forest for the trees' means. Several times, I found myself so deeply mired in statistics that I forgot what decade Okey was talking about, let alone what point he was trying to make. The second half of the book was somewhat better than the first in this regard, but it was still tough reading at times.<br />In all, I am afraid this book may be way too much information for an amateur/generalist like me. At the same time, comprehensive as it is, it may not be enough for the specialists researching a specific, narrowly focused, topic. All of which makes me wonder, as I said, for whom it was written.<br />In that Foreword, Okey writes, 'It is hoped that there will be a place, therefore, for a survey of the Monarchy from the later eighteenth century that takes account of advances in Habsburg studies since the publication of C.A. Macartney's magisterial &quot;The Habsburg Empire&quot; in 1968.' After hacking through this dense book, I have to say that there is *still* a place for such a book -- at least where the amateur historian and general reader are concernedcation of C.A. Macartney's magisterial &quot;The Habsburg Empire&quot; in 1968.'

At first, it seemed like Mike was just trying too hard. The laugh-every-ten-seconds or so pace we got used to with MST3K is easier to sustain when a team of writers is working together. It's much harder to do solo, and in print. I was a little disappointed.<br />But then, about four essays in, something clicked for me. Maybe it was Mike's revelation of the 'glaring flaw' in Action Jackson (p. 38). Certainly, by the time he deconstructed the digital-snake flick 'Anaconda' ('He was saved from having to give breath to much of the script, which is more an assemblage of random words than an actual script ... It all makes for a special kind of tedium that would be impossible with a traditional, more \\"written\\" script.' [p.72-73]), I was hoppin' on the bandwagon.<br />Maybe my problem was I went into this expecting a Kael-esque collection of movie reviews, instead of the kind of good-natured but dead-on mockery I came to love as a true-blue MSTie. Once I shifted into MST-mode, everything was just fine. I even re-read the essays I didn't quite get the first time, and darn it, they were funny too.<br />That's not to say Mike's not a great movie reviewer. He is. His ability to make telling comparisons and draw devastating analogies is really admirable. Plus, he has unmasked Adam Sandler, Keanu Reeves, and Carrot Top as the threats to human civilization that they truly are, and for this he deserves our thanks.<br />I'm sorry I doubted you, buddy. This book is not only insightful, but also very, very funny (Mike's dismemberment of Streisand's awful 'The Mirror has Two Faces' is brilliant). Any MST3K fan will love this.	2002-03-20

Bush and the Bush Family Dynasty	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A good early introduction to the man	Author Bill Minutaglio began his research during George W. Bush's first term as Governor of Texas, and published his book as the groundswell within the GOP for Bush's nomination for president was starting to crest. While not as muckraking as many of Dubya's critics would prefer, it's not a campaign puff-piece, either. On the whole, it's not a bad introduction to the man, and a fairly insightful look at how the fact of being a Bush has shaped the man's life.<br />George the Elder cut a wide swath through Andover and Yale, was a certified war hero, and a highly visible politician. George the Younger followed his father in many of these paths, dealing with both the blessing and the curse, not only of having a famous dad, but even sharing his name. Being his father's son no doubt opened many doors for George II, but it also seemed to give him the resolution to find ways to strike out on his own and establish himself as his own man. Minutaglio does a good job illustrating some of the ways he achieved, or failed to achieve, this. (When Dubya made his 1992 announcement that he was running for governor, the Houston Chronicle ran a photo of his father by mistake.)<br />I think what I found most interesting in Minutaglio's narrative was his contention that from a relatively early age, Dubya was not only a conservative (more so than his father ever was), but saw himself as caught up in a distinct cultural conflict: Bush's freshman-year clash with Yale chaplain and leftie icon William Sloane Coffin looms large in this book<br />It's fascinating to re-read this book in light of President Bush (the Younger)'s conduct of office in the wake of September 11. More than just the DKE frat boy finally running the biggest club of all, the George W. Bush in these pages is a man who, at his core, has a strong sense of who he is and what he wants to do. As with any president, there will be (and already are) lots and lots of biographies of George W. Bush. I think 'First Son' will stand up as one of the best early efforts.one of the best early efforts.	2002-03-14

But I was pleasantly surprised to find a number of truly funny excerpts and turns-of-phrase here and there ('Socrates was accused of sophmorism and sentenced to die of hemroyds.'). One ('Arranged marriages required women to accept a kind of *mate accompli.*) even made me wonder if it really was a mistake, or in fact a truly clever pun.<br />There's a lot in here to laugh at...<br />... until you start crying at the realization of who produced these errors. In his 'Postscript: The Meaning of All This,' Henriksson seems reluctant to call his book an indictment of the school system. He notes, fairly, that the stress of test taking and an over reliance on spell-check programs have much to do with it. He also points out that the classic of this genre, Sellar and Yeatman's '1066 and All That' (1930), satirized some of England's very best preparatory schools. At the same time, though, we need to remember that, despite all evidence, the examples in this book didn't come from sixth graders in remedial history classes, but from 'some of the most selective and academically renowned institutions in the United States and Canada.' That a student who would write 'United States Grant was a Civil War heroe who later proved corrupulent as President. He died after drinking up to twenty cigars a day' was admitted to one of those allegedly selective institutions in the first place, is cause for alarm.<br />Apart from that larger issue, however, the book is pretty funny.	2002-03-14

In their place, the Royal and merchant navies created the Rescue Ship Service, made up of civilian ships and mariners, usually augmented by RN doctors. The story of these gallant ships, almost completely forgotten now, is well told in this interesting book.<br />The ships' main duty was to follow a convoy and rescue sailors whose ships had been sunk by torpedoes and enemy gunfire. However, because they were not covered by international rules regarding hospital ships, they could engage in a variety of other activities as well. Many of the rescue ships were equipped with HF/DF, a system that allowed them to locate enemy U-boats based on their radio transmissions. They thus assisted in defending the convoys. Captain (later Admiral Sir) Peter Gretton, a famed convoy escort commander quoted in this book, wrote, 'It was a great thing to have a Rescue Ship with the convoy again, there never being enough of these invaluable ships to go round. ... In fact, with their wide experience of convoy work, they were almost as good as an extra escort, though they had no means of offence.'<br />There are many tales of real heroism in this book, and even I, who tend to grow tired of fishing-men-out-of-the-sea stories after just a few pages, found myself truly impressed. The authors, naval officers who had chain-of-command associations with the rescue ships during the war, do a fine job in rescuing these ships and their gallant crews from obscurity. Students of the World War Two convoy system should be sure to acquaint themselves with this part of the story.	2002-03-12

For operational reasons, the Navy reported this as a 'small mishap,' and, amidst the larger war, the incident was largely forgotten.<br />Nearly 40 years later, William L.C. Johnson, a survivor of the explosions, asked another Navy man a by-the-way question about the event. One thing led to another, as they say, and within a few years, Johnson had collected dozens of first-hand accounts and photographs from eyewitnesses of the disaster. Out of those accounts comes this book.<br />William Johnson is no David McCullough, and this book will never be considered for a Pulitzer. It's not highly polished history -- it doesn't even, for example, get to the bottom of what really triggered the explosions in the first place. What this book is, however, is a very personal, and moving, labor of love, both for the author himself and for the many other men whose stories are told here.<br />In fact, the second half of the book is made up entirely of personal accounts from Marines, Army soldiers, and Navy and Coast Guard men who were there that day. Johnson also includes records of the Navy Board of Inquiry on the disaster, and the logs of several of the ships involved. These latter, especially, help illustrate the scope of the event, while the personal accounts demonstrate the chaos on the scene.<br />The West Loch disaster was, in the grand scheme of the war in the Pacific, a relatively minor event. It didn't even delay 'Operation Forager,' the invasion of Saipan for which the ships and men were being readied. But it wasn't minor for the men who experienced it, or for the families and friends of those who died. As the era, and the men who lived it, fade from view, this small book helps remember the men who gave their lives in action in May 1944.	2002-03-12

Nancy Allen is a skilled writer and observer, but it didn't seem to me that the various parts of this book always knitted together well.<br />For a 'honeymoon,' I came away knowing some of the other crew members of the M/V Sea-Land Endurance better than I knew Nancy's new husband Bob, the Chief Mate. For the rest of the 'adventure,' the author relates what she saw, in her role as 'supernumerary, ' with style and immediacy. But the picture of the life of the modern merchant mariner still felt somewhat incomplete.<br />High points of the book were Nancy's descriptions of foreign ports; her enlightening discussions with female crew members and with Keith, the radio operator; her visits to the stern of the ship (in the midst of a storm) and the engine room; and her discussion of issues of foreign flagging, unions, and the impact of regulation. The typographic decision to print excerpts from Nancy's journal in italics was somewhat annoying: page after page of italicized type can get hard on the eyes.<br />Personally, I thought the foreword by former Maritime Administrator Albert J. Herberger was pretty much useless -- though it could have been his kiss-up to Bill Clinton that turned me off. But then, who expects much from forewords anyway?<br />Despite its weaknesses, this was not a bad read, and I recommend it for anyone interested in true-life sea stories and the American merchant marine. At its best, it's highly personal and told with great style. Despite the hyperbolic dust jacket copy, it's not quite 'a saga of the sea and the modern mariners who sail it.' It's more like a conversation with a friend than a latter-day Melville. And there's nothing wrong with that.	2002-03-05

In a time when the 'sweeping family saga' is a popular fiction genre, the fact that this story isn't only true, but also extremely well written, should commend it to any reader with an interest in European history.<br />Of course, the von Moltke family's impact actually reaches back before the Reich into the history of Prussia. The first of three men Otto Friedrich focuses on, Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke (1800-1891), was Prussia's key military strategist during the Franco-Prussian War, and possibly Germany's greatest strategist ever, surpassing even his friend and mentor, Clausewitz. His nephew and namesake, General Helmuth von Moltke (1848-1916), on the other hand, was nervous, indecisive, and largely unable to deal with the responsibilities of command that came to him in part due to his famous name. The third Helmuth, Count Helmuth James von Moltke (1907-1945), was one of nature's noblemen. A liberal (in the European sense), he was actively involved in the opposition to Hitler and Nazism -- a fact that led to his execution shortly before the Reich's own collapse. The letters Helmuth James wrote from prison, to his wife most notably, but to others as well, are deeply moving, and filled with a Christian spirit that reminded me of St Paul's own epistles from prison.<br />Otto Friedrich is a tremendously skilled historian, and also an excellent writer. 'Blood and Iron' is well documented, logically presented, and also very readable. Plus, he's not afraid to share his opinions and interpretations, most particularly in 'A Note on Sources' following the close of the narrative.

He did not command the naval ships that might (or might not) be guarding the convoy, but was responsible for keeping the tankers, troopships, cargo carriers, and other ships in line and on schedule. It was a heavy, and at times nerve-wracking, responsibility. And it's upon this man that Philip McCutchan focuses in what became the first of a series of convoy novels.<br />Not having looked at the Battle of the Atlantic from the merchantman's side very often before, I found this book a very interesting and entertaining change of pace. Though the commodore is not a navy man, his story has its share of battle scenes -- often reminiscent of Douglas Reeman's stories. Main and supporting characters are drawn well, and the narration on the audiocassettes was competently done. Tracking down and reading (or listening to) other McCutchan titles is definitely on my to-do list, and I encourage any fan of World War Two-at-sea stories to do the same.	2002-02-28

We were discussing Switzerland recently, and someone asked, 'What do the Swiss eat, anyway?' Apart from the obvious -- cheese and chocolate -- I had no idea. But then I found this attractive book, and now my questions are answered.<br />Sue Style here tackles the difficult task of giving us a culinary portrait of a nation which, as she points out in her introduction, is 'at least four countries rolled into one,' not counting influences from neighboring countries and cultures. The key, she says, is in realizing that Swiss food, wine, and tastes aren't monolithic, but rather vary (sometimes widely) from canton to canton.<br />Aided by John Miller's skilled photography of landscapes (sometimes I wonder if it's even possible to take an unattractive photo of Switzerland), people, and ... not least of all ... food, Style not only gives us a wide variety of recipes, but also shows how those foods fit into the broader Swiss lifestyle. Bread, cheese, chocolate, and sausage ... each gets its own chapter, as do Swiss winemaking (who knew? -- 'Many Swiss wines never make it beyond the confines of the canton, let alone the country' -- yet some are apparently quite nice) and the art of the Swiss innkeeper.<br />In all, whether you have no experience of Swiss food at all, or are a former visitor or resident looking to recreate happy memories, Sue Style's book seems like an excellent way to explore the surprisingly varied world of Swiss tastes.	2002-02-28

Austrian history barely merits a blip, save for August 1914. It's not surprising, therefore, that 'Prince Felix zu Schwarzenberg' is -- as far as I've been able to determine -- the only English-language biography of a most interesting historical figure.<br />The Schwarzenbergs were one of the richest and most powerful families in the Austrian empire. Prince Felix (1800-1852), after a 'colorful' early life, buckled down and became prime minister following the revolutions of 1848. It was he who engineered the abdication of Emperor Ferdinand and his heir, Archduke Francis Charles, in favor of the latter's 18-year-old son Francis Joseph, and later helped restore the empire's authority in the wake of nationalistic uprisings. Though often denounced as a reactionary, Schwarzenberg was actually a more nuanced statesman, actually sweeping away many of the lingering remnants of feudalism and laying the foundations for the more modern (for good or ill) centralized state. It's one of history's interesting, if neglected, 'what-ifs?' to speculate on how Europe might have been different had Schwarzenberg lived another two or three decades, instead of dying of a sudden stroke at age 52.<br />A scion of the same family, Adolph Schwarzenberg has done an excellent job in this biography -- especially considering that he was writing at a time when government and family archives had largely been seized by the Nazi occupiers of Austria and Bohemia (where the family's ancestral home is located). The bulk of his work focuses on Prince Felix's years in power, with separate sections on domestic and foreign policy and a special emphasis on 'the German problem.' The book is detailed, but also very readable, and it opens the door to an important figure and time in European history. It's a title I was glad to get my own copy of, and one I return to often.itle I was glad to get my own copy of, and one I return to often.	2002-02-28

It was the product of many men's ideas and experiences. It was also a link in a long chain of efforts by the political communities of North America to put down on parchment the proper relationship between government and citizen. In showing (to change the metaphor) the family tree of the U.S. Constitution, this book is an invaluable documentary resource for anyone attempting to understand the origins and meaning of our system's central document.<br />From the 'Articles, Laws, and Orders, Divine, Politic, and Martial for the Colony in Virginia' (1610) and the Mayflower Compact (1620), through to the Articles of Confederation (1777), Donald Lutz has assembled an impressive documentary history. But his intention isn't simply to catalogue old contracts. As he notes in his Preface, Lutz's goal is to show how the early Americans thought of themselves, how they began to knit themselves together as a people, and how certain critical concepts -- popular sovereignty, rule of law, a virtuous society -- were adopted as 'symbols' of an emerging American consciousness. In this regard, the 'Introductory Essay' is itself a valuable piece of work.<br />Both as an analysis and a collection of primary documents, this book deserves to be near at hand to any student of American constitutional history and practice.	2002-02-28

Today, that's precisely what the American political system has become, as political economists James T. Bennett and Thomas J. DiLorenzo make clear in this excellent book. The examples are, by now, somewhat out of date. But they outrages they report on have, if anything, only gotten worse.<br />In many ways, the State has become little more than an engine for the forced redistribution of money. People vote for politicians who will give them things, hoping what they get from picking their neighbors' pockets will be greater than what someone else, in turn, takes out of their own. Politicians flog the system for all it's worth, and are rewarded according to their ability to hand out loot they have no right to in the first place.<br />Of all the ways this is done, the most egregious, at least in Bennett and DiLorenzo's minds, is the pouring of tax dollars into organizations that then use that money to lobby for specific policy agendas. Again and again, Bennett and DiLorenzo give us chapter and verse (and dollar amounts) of how labor unions, environmental radicals, anti-market and pro-socialist, 'anti-poverty,' 'civil rights,' and other pressure groups pocket free money at taxpayer expense. Conservative, industry, and pro-business groups aren't spared their time in the spotlight either. Nor are the politicians (many of whom are still in office today) who receive hefty campaign cash from the same groups to whom they funneled those tax dollars.<br />George Will has written that anyone who wants to understand how American government works shouldn't read the Constitution, but rather open the Washington, D.C., phone book and observe all the organizations, associations, and lobbies with the word 'National' in their name. Bennett and DiLorenzo provide an invaluable service by exposing this racket fully. Even seventeen or more years after its first publication, 'Destroying Democracy' is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand what politics and the State are really all about.g this racket fully.

In another one of his classic war-at-sea stories, Douglas Reeman builds toward a climactic (as opposed to climatic) confrontation that really draws the reader in.<br />Reeman's characters in 'Rendezvous - South Atlantic,' as is frequently the case in his writings, are sometimes hard to distinguish from men and women you've met in his earlier novels. But as is also common in his work, the star of this book is really the ship herself. 'Benbecula' stands apart from much of Reeman's other creations, and the battle in which she finds herself will be one you won't forget. I've read nearly a dozen Reeman titles and enjoyed nearly all of them. But this is one of two or three that really stands out for me.	2002-02-28

The book actually ranges beyond the escorts themselves to take in all aspects of 'the Longest Battle,' from planning and leadership, to key clashes, to (of course) epic survival stories of merchant mariners adrift in the open ocean.<br />As you'd expect from a volume this size, 'Decision at Sea' is not the definitive book on the topic. However, the important things are not slighted. Men like Max Horton, Peter Gretton, and Otto Kretschmer, events like the PQ-17 and SC-130 convoys, and innovations like HF/DF and the 'wolf pack' all get the attention they deserve. (Gretton's own book, 'Convoy Escort Commander' [Cassell, 1964], is a good title to read in convoy, as it were, with this one.) Anyone looking for a good survey of the topic, possibly as a prelude to deeper study, will find much of value here.	2002-02-28

Many of Reeman's titles feature variations on two or three stock characters, and after a while, it's hard to tell Keith Drummond of this novel apart from John Devane of 'Torpedo Run' or any number of Our Heroes from other titles.<br />The real centerpieces of Reeman's stories, though, are ships and battles, and when it comes to this, the various titles stand out much more clearly. In 'The Destroyers,' Commander Drummond has to lead a group of tired old tin cans (did the British call them that too?) on a special operations mission in the North Atlantic. The story is a lively one, and demonstrates yet again that what truly distinguishes Reeman is his ability to weave an engrossing tale of naval combat. This one is worth a read.	2002-02-28

And when that man's influence is still being felt today -- not just in his native country but around the world -- it makes the neglect into which he has fallen all the more shameful.<br />The man Jefferson described so admiringly was George Mason of Virginia (1725-1792). Almost without exception, his contemporaries in America's real 'greatest generation' considered Mason one of their leading lights. Helen Hill Miller's excellent biography -- first published in the 1930s, reissued in 1966, and reprinted again in 2001 -- makes it clear why their assessment is correct.<br />One reason he is so little remembered today is that he consistently shunned the limelight, and usually refused public office. He wasn't a spellbinding orator like Henry, a natural leader like Washington, a 'character' like Franklin, or a renaissance man like Jefferson. What he was, was a man with a keen insight and penetrating mind, who had thought deeply about government, society, and how the two interact. This leads Miller to give Mason the apt label, 'constitutionalist.'<br />Mason was the author of the Fairfax Resolves and the Virginia Declaration of Rights -- a document that not only anticipated and inspired the Declaration of Independence, but also the Bill of Rights and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen -- and he was central to the crafting of the post-Revolutionary constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia, 'the first American constitution to be prepared with a view to the establishment of a permanently independent state' [p. viii]. Later, his writings framed the Northwest Ordinance, possibly the most significant act taken under the Articles of Confederation. He was a key participant in the Mount Vernon Convention, which led directly to the Annapolis Convention of 1786 and, in turn, to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.<br />One of Virginia's delegates to the Constitutional Convention, Mason was a key participant in debates. Ultimately, however, he could not sign the document he helped create. In the Virginia Ratification Convention (one of the most fascinating moments in American history, in my opinion), he led the fight against the Old Dominion's adoption of the Constitution.<br />Mason's key reasons for opposing the Constitution included its lack of a bill of rights and its continuance of the slave trade. Miller does an excellent job showing us the workings of Mason's mind on these questions.<br />Mason's passion for anonymity -- which led him to refuse the offer of one of Virginia's two seats in the U.S. Senate -- was one of the defining characteristics of his life. In his will, he advised his sons 'to prefer the happiness and independence [of] a private station to the troubles and vexations of Public Business.' Two centuries after his death, however, Mason deserves not anonymity but celebration. He is one of the truly great figures in American history ... not just for his passionate love of liberty, but also for the concrete ways he worked to make sure that liberty would be enjoyed by later generations.

Still, after reading this exhaustively researched book, it's hard to believe many Americans apparently considered merchant mariners little better than draft dodgers (one merchant sailor who'd had seven ships torpedoed out from under him was thrown out of a club for 'not being in the service'). It took nearly fifty years for them to officially be accorded 'veteran' status.<br />The story of World War II can't be told, the war itself couldn't have been fought, without the merchant marine. Merchant mariners, in turn, suffered a higher percentage of casualties -- nearly one in four -- than any (other) American armed service. John Bunker, himself a former merchant mariner, has produced a book that tells the merchant marine story in detail ... in an awful lot of detail, in fact. Not really a history of the Maritime Service, or of the strategy of merchant shipping, a slightly more accurate subtitle might have been 'The story of American merchant mariners in World War II.'<br />733 American merchant ships were lost during the war, and Bunker sometimes seems determined to tell us about every single one of them. I sometimes found myself skimming over tales that, for all their heroism and undoubted drama, still sounded similar to others he'd already told. One chapter, for example, is about ships being torpedoed and men surviving on rafts in the icy waters of the North Atlantic. The next chapter is about ships being torpedoed and men surviving on rafts in the shark-infested Caribbean. The next is about ships being torpedoed and men surviving on rafts in the trackless wastes of the Pacific. Then came the one about ships that went down in storms...<br />Despite the repetitive nature of some of this, however, many memorable stories do stand out. Men like Gustave Alm, Cadet Edwin O'Hara, or Rexford Dickey, or the crews of the 'Stanvac Calcutta,' the 'Stephen Hopkins' (O'Hara's ship), or the 'Cedar Mills' can rightfully take their place in any collection of genuine war heroes.

His argument is strong and well-reasoned. Even people unwilling to consider wholesale changes to the constitutional system that has lasted this long will find much to ponder in this brief book.<br />Hazlitt argues that the tremendous expansion of government size and power has made our original constitutional design unworkable. The more government tries to do, he says, the less it is able to do well. Additionally, as he writes in the preface to the second edition, 'No man today can possess the knowledge, the wisdom, the judgment, the humility, the restraint to know how to exercise such powers and to make such a multitude of crucial decisions. In brief, so long as a President has such awesome responsibilities and powers, no man, no human being, is fit to be President.'<br />Hazlitt also argues that the Nixon impeachment crisis proves that the constitutional system is too unwieldy: a parliamentary system could have removed Nixon without provoking a 'constitutional crisis.' The same argument can be made again, of course, citing the Clinton example.<br />In all, this book by a respected economist and political writer deserves much wider attention than it has ever received. For people who believe government is ultimately reformable, Hazlitt's suggestions are an important contribution to a long-overdue debate.	2002-02-04

Instead, the crux of his argument seems to be that the reporters, editors, producers, and network executives of the so-called 'mainstream media' live in such an insulated, self-referential world that they actually believe, as Dan Rather once argued, that The New York Times editorial page is 'middle of the road.'<br />Goldberg's book seems aimed, not so much at the general reading public, but at his former colleagues in broadcast news. Indeed, it should come as no surprise to anyone (outside Hollywood and Manhattan, anyway) that the news media has a leftward tilt. According to the late Brill's Content magazine, a 2000 survey showed that even 47 percent of registered Democrats 'believe that most journalists are more liberal than they are.' Only Dan, Tom, Peter, and their fellow insiders continue to insist that they're 'fair and balanced.'<br />Bernard Goldberg is not ideologically driven. He's not (no matter what Dan Rather and his acolytes say) a member of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy, nor a 'political activist' pushing a 'political agenda.' Instead, he's pleading with his former colleagues to recognize how far they've strayed away from objectivity and into advocacy. It's a compelling argument to those of us here on the outside. I doubt any of his real audience is even paying attention.<br />Goldberg's many examples of quotas, preconditions, entertainment-as-news, editorials-as-analysis, and all the rest, are inexorable. It's powerful confirmation of the observation once uttered by the late Austrian writer Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn, that the astute observer approaches the media with the mindset, 'What lies do they want me to believe today?'<br />Today, network TV news is little more than a subset (and a not particularly successful one at that) of the larger 'entertainment industry.' If Bernard Goldberg's powerful book doesn't wake up industry executives to the fact that 'the ship be sinking' (one of his chapter titles), it should at least convince the rest of us to release broadcast 'news' from whatever claim it once had to be taken seriously.s do they want me to believe today?'<br />Today, network TV news is little more than a subset (and a not particularly successful one at that) of the larger 'entertainment industry.'

Harbron's story of the RCN in the Second World War is an especially educational and evocative one.<br />The story is nothing less than one of transformation. From its 'miniscule' starting point in 1939, the RCN was by 1945 the fourth largest navy in the world, with nearly 500 ships in commission. Almost all of those had been constructed during the war in Canadian shipyards, which also were able to turn out more than 400 critically needed merchant vessels for the North Atlantic convoys. Thousands of men and women who had no experience with the sea were turned into a disciplined and efficient fighting force, building a war record of which any nation could be proud.<br />While not intended as a comprehensive history of fleet actions, 'The Longest Battle' nevertheless tells its story effectively. In the battle of the North Atlantic, German U-boats and Canadian ships squared off without ceasing from the start of the war to the final surrender -- hence the title, 'The Longest Battle.' The fighting often surged into Canada's own waters, sometimes as far west as the St Lawrence River itself.<br />Harbron also gives us a brief but descriptive look at the various classes of Canadian warships, the growth of the merchant navy, the history of the Wrens (officially, Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service, or WRCNS), and, interestingly, a chapter about the RCN's antagonists, the U-boats and their crews. There is also a touching section telling the stories of two RCN families and their wartime experiences.<br />Harbron also argues that the transformation of the RCN had a lasting effect on Canada's society. In the 1940s, Canada was far more British, culturally and ethnically, than it is today. He writes, 'Canadian nationalism was reborn in the wartime mess decks of the Royal Canadian Navy. In September 1939 the tiny Canadian navy went to war as a pliant auxiliary of the [British] Royal Navy. In May 1945, it emerged at the peace as a full-blown, confident Canadian national institution in which Canadians from all our geographic regions and many ethnic communities had been drawn together in a common cause' (p. 19).<br />A book this size can only skim the surface of all there is to tell about its subject.

In 1937, Etter wrote, 'The armed defense of the country is a primary and substantial task of the state. The mental defense of the country falls primarily not on the state but on the person, the citizen. No government and no battalions are able to protect right and freedom where the citizen himself is not capable of stepping to the front door and seeing what is outside.' No one familiar with Halbrook's other works should be surprised that this seems to be one of the key lessons Halbrook wants us to learn from his history of Switzerland in World War II.<br />Halbrook makes it clear that Switzerland walked a tightrope during the War. Fierce and well trained as the Swiss citizen-army was, it was not eager to tangle with Hitler's Wehrmacht. Though unquestionably sympathetic to the allies, the Swiss were determined to maintain their neutrality. If that meant making some economic concessions to Germany in order to keep the Nazis from overrunning the country, the Swiss were willing, reluctantly, to do that. It's easier to second-guess that decision from half a century's distance than it must have been at the time, when national-socialist armies dominated the continent and liberation was still a distant dream.<br />As other reviewers have noted, Halbrook is clearly sympathetic, not only to the Swiss nation generally, but specifically to its armed-citizenry approach to national defense. With Switzerland being so greatly maligned in recent years, it's not surprising that voices have been raised in its defense as well. While not perhaps perfect, 'Target Switzerland' is a fascinating and enlightening explanation of the dilemma in which Switzerland found itself in the 1930s and 40s, and why and how that nation chose to do the things it did.	2002-01-21

Prange and his literary assistants/successors Goldstein and Dillon are best known for their multi-volume exploration of the before-during-and-after of the attack on Pearl Harbor, arguably the most-written (and argued) about event in American history. Impressive and valuable as their work on Pearl Harbor is, few would argue it's the final word on what happened and why.<br />Fortunately, Midway isn't enshrouded in political agendas and conspiracy theories like Pearl Harbor has become. It's still a fairly straightforward clash of military and naval forces. Consequently, it's much easier to argue that Prange has painted a fairly definitive portrait of what Fuchida Mitsuo later called 'the battle that doomed Japan.' One of the beautiful (and trying) things about history is that 'final judgment' is never rendered on any event -- new evidence and interpretations can always change the way we view things. Serious historians and casual readers alike will find Prange's work a valuable set of lenses through which to view this critical moment in world history.	2002-01-21

Although I enjoyed his idiosyncratic and engaging style, it was the subject matter of this brief study that interested me most. I've read a couple of McPhee's other books since, and enjoyed those, too. But this one is my favorite, because it's still the subject, rather than the author, that intrigues me most.<br />It's been said that Switzerland is not a country with an army, but rather an army with a country. McPhee shows us how the militia-army concept -- the every-citizen-as-soldier idea that has been emulated by Israel, for example -- plays out in the lives of Swiss citizens like Luc Massy, McPhee's host on a series of military training exercises. The exercises are more like camping trips for the soldiers, but McPhee shows that behind the breezy attitudes, national defense is a deadly serious business for the Swiss nation and people.<br />Switzerland's pastoral countryside may never look quite the same again, once you realize that nearly every bridge has been fitted with explosives, the faster to destroy them in case of invasion. That any snow-capped peak may hide artillery emplacements or entire squadrons of fighter jets. That a silent glacier (like the title Place de la Concorde Suisse) may become a front-line airfield at the first sign of trouble. And that, of course, most every farmhouse contains firearms and men and women trained to use them.<br />Since this book was first published in 1983, there has been a spate of books about the Swiss in World War Two. Coming as it did before that storm, 'La Place de la Concorde Suisse' is a useful way to get a feeling for the Swiss militia system, uncolored (pro or con) by the strong feelings that arose a decade or so later. I recommend this book to anyone interested in a look at Switzerland's unique national defense system in practice.	2002-01-21

Gregg notes in his preface, opponents of the Electoral College can employ simple slogans -- like 'Majority Rule!' or 'Democracy!' -- to advance their arguments. Proponents of the College, however, find their arguments 'won't fit on the back of a Volvo' (as the noted thinker Linus Van Pelt said, 'There's a difference between a philosophy and a bumper sticker.'). They need books like ... well, like this one. People who support the idea of the Electoral College, or who are inclined at least to give the Founders the benefit of the doubt, will find reinforcement and useful ideas to advance their arguments. Opponents probably won't be convinced.<br />Part of the problem is that to grasp why we have an Electoral College requires some familiarity with America's founding, the nature and purpose of the Union, the meaning of federalism, the role of the States (are they the creatures of the central government, or vice versa, or what?), and ... heresy of heresies ... the dangers of 'democracy,' which the Founders more or less equated with mob rule. In short, some effort and discipline and time have to be put into the question, plus what Daniel Patrick Moynihan refers to as 'solemn, prolonged, and prayerful consideration' (p. 88). It's so much easier just to watch Dan Rather and get good and worked up about 'the stolen presidency.'<br />As with any collection of essays, this book doesn't carry a logical strain of argumentation through from page to page. The contributors approach the question of the Electoral College from various perspectives, and inevitably there is some rehashing of history and theory, and a few divergences of opinion. The overall effect, however, is positive.<br />The other characteristic in a collection of essays is that some contributions are better than others. That's certainly true in this case. However, I disagree with the institutional reviews of this book that suggest the 'invective' employed by some of the contributors damages their arguments irreparably. People who throw around loaded words like 'theft' and 'coup' have to expect strong language from the other side too.<br />In all, Gary Gregg's book goes a long way toward confirming Sen. Moynihan's belief (in the same paragraph I quoted above) that abolishing the Electoral College would be 'the most radical transformation in our political system that has ever been considered.' It's just a shame that so few Americans will expend the effort to figure that out.guments irreparably.

But I'll return to it again soon. 'The Roosevelt Myth' is a book that will, I am sure, massively repay repeated readings.<br />In this book, journalist John T. Flynn takes a buzzsaw to one of America's most unjustly inflated reputations. It's hard to describe how incredibly comprehensive his book is. The New Deal -- in all its fraudulent incarnations -- is analyzed, as are FDR's decisions to run for a third, and then a fourth, term. The ways socialists, communists, and other pinkos (Flynn's term) infiltrated ... no, flooded ... into the Roosevelt Administration and used it for their own purposes in war and peace are made shockingly clear, as is the way America' war propaganda system was used to promote Joe Stalin and slander and smear American anti-communists. The way FDR's wife and children used his name to make themselves rich is also thoroughly explored, as is the growth of the Regulatory State, a Roosevelt invention, as a tool of political, economic, and social control.<br />In my Amazon.com review of Thomas Fleming's 'The New Dealers' War: FDR and the War Within World War II' (Basic Books: 2001), I said that it sometimes seemed FDR viewed the New Deal more as an electoral ploy than an ideological commitment. Flynn makes it clear (I wish I'd read this book before Fleming's) that there's no 'seemed' about it: the New Deal *never was anything but* an electoral ploy. The New Deal Roosevelt campaigned on in 1932 was jettisoned before he even entered office. The one he introduced in the First Hundred Days had a different philosophical foundation, different programs, and different goals. The so-called 'Third New Deal,' several years later, was yet again different from the two that preceded it. In short, the New Deal was a political bait-and-switch operation from the very beginning.<br />The reason the New Deal wasn't ideological, Flynn argues again and again, is that FDR himself was a man with no fundamental philosophy of government, no understanding of economics or finance, and no objective beyond maximizing the votes he would receive at the next election. He stumbled from policy to policy, and crisis to crisis, looking only for ways to gain political advantage.<br />(Flynn makes it clear, for example, that FDR deliberately refused to work with the lame-duck President Hoover to mitigate the effects of the Depression in the winter of 1932-33. FDR wanted to make sure the crisis got as bad as possible, so Republicans would be demonized and himself celebrated as the man who single-handedly turned the economy around. Years later, as the Depression got even worse, FDR seriously considered throwing the 1940 election so the GOP would be in the White House when the economy hit bottom a second time. Then, he and the Democrats would ride to the rescue again in 1944. The onset of World War II in Europe convinced him to scrap this idea and run for a third term immediately.)<br />'The Roosevelt Myth' has a great deal of application for the twenty-first century reader. For example, 'Any unfavorable turn [Roosevelt] attributed to a secret plot of his enemies. Any criticism of his measures he put down to some secret hatred of him personally' [Book 2, chapter 3]. Or, 'Mrs Roosevelt's long residence in the White House and the long indulgence of the people toward numerous journeys by the family across the borderline of good conduct had badly confused her sense of the proprieties. The unwritten law for Presidents and their families is that they shall be more meticulous than any in the observance of the ethical and social restraints enforced upon the population in times of stress. But Mrs Roosevelt felt that her position in the White House entitled her to an exemption from these restraints' [Book 3, chapter 2].<br />And again: 'Roosevelt's apologists have sought to dismiss Pegler's charges, not by refuting the facts, but by calling him a Roosevelt-hater' [footnote, Book 3, chapter 3]. Or, 'There was a wide streak of egotism in Roosevelt which made it impossible for him in some circumstances to perceive the fine line that divides correct from improper conduct in public office -- especially in so exalted an office as the presidency' [Book 3, chapter 3]. Or, as a final example, 'In the case of Roosevelt, with his somewhat easy approach to official virtue, his weakness for snap judgments, his impulsive starts in unconsidered directions, his vanity, his lack of a settled political philosophy, his appetite for political power and his great capacity as a mere politician, the Presidency became in his hands an instrument of appalling consequences' [ibid].<br />Substitute 'Clinton' for 'Roosevelt' in any of the sentences above quoted, and who can say this is not a dead-on portrayal of America's 42nd president? I guess Mr and Mrs Clinton were more 'Rooseveltian' than any of us realized.<br />Today, the mythic portrayal of FDR as the man who saved America and then stepped forward (ahead of his isolationist people) to save the world, is stronger than ever. That makes 'The Roosevelt Myth' as essential a read as it ever was. Whatever you're reading, put it down and read this first.hapter 3].

If he could in good conscience no longer call himself a Republican -- even by the desiccated standards of New England Republicanism -- then he did the right thing by leaving. I salute him for standing by his principles.<br />That said...<br />This disappointing little book is the largest pile of self-justification I've run into since the last time I saw Bill Clinton on TV. I had hoped that, with a sweeping title like 'My Declaration of Independence,' Jeffords would give us a broad statement of principles -- a defiant manifesto of left-wing (or, as he insists on calling it, 'moderate') Republicanism. If I couldn't agree with it, at least I'd learn some things. No such luck. The 'declaration' he refers to is apparently his actual statement of May 24, 2001, at which he announced he was leaving the GOP. A more accurate title for this book would have been, 'How I Made the Decision I Did and Why I'm Okay With It.'<br />Still, it's not hard to figure out where Jeffords stands ideologically. At one point, discussing his idea of the proper role of government in society, he approvingly quotes the patron saint of Big Government, Franklin Roosevelt. Elsewhere, he declares that the role of the federal government is to spread the costs of social engineering (I paraphrase) across the whole of society.<br />If anyone fits the classic definition of a 'liberal' as someone who's compassionate with other people's money, it's James Jeffords. On pages 70 and 71, he says flat-out, 'Every dollar in tax cuts is a dollar unavailable for education.' The more truthful statement, that every dollar stolen in taxes is a dollar that parents can't put into their children's education themselves, apparently has never occured to him. Jeffords also speaks disparagingly of Republicans whose idea of education reform is to help children escape from government schools.<br />On the whole, a little between-the-lines reading of this short book makes Jeffords' philosophy of government very clear -- unimaginative, conventional, and wedded to Big Government, but there it is. If you're *not* reading between the lines, all you'll get is the chronology of a dramatic few weeks in one self-absorbed politician's (or is that redundant?) life, spiced by occasional clouds of legislative minutia.<br />If that's what you want to spend your time on, help yourself.ducation reform is to help children escape from government schools.<br />On the whole, a little between-the-lines reading of this short book makes Jeffords' philosophy of government very clear -- unimaginative, conventional, and wedded to Big Government, but there it is.

However, I was very pleasantly surprised. Compared to [[ASIN:0140280243 A Treasury of Royal Scandals: The Shocking True Stories History's Wickedest, Weirdest, Most Wanton Kings, Queens, Tsars, Popes, and Emperors]] by Michael Farquhar, which covers much of the same ground in a far more tendentious fashion, 'Royal Babylon' is a very good book.<br /><br />The sell-copy on the book's cover makes 'Royal Babylon' sound like nothing more than recycled gossip and titillating stories about Those Nasty Royals. It's actually a somewhat more systematic history than that, with in-depth profiles of several monarchs and thumbnail sketches of many others. Shaw also charts thoroughly the recurring incidences of mental and physical illness in the massively inbred family trees of European royalty, and tells tales of drunkenness and debauchery that never made it into the official history books.<br /><br />Unlike Farquhar, Shaw doesn't moralize about monarchy as an institution, or argue that his findings invalidate the very idea of having a hereditary head of state. In fact, he makes the important distinction (on pages 125-127) that in a constitutional monarchy like Britain, having a nut -- to use the clinical term -- on the throne, while still not a good thing, has far fewer negative repercussions than it does in absolute monarchies like Prussia or Imperial Russia.<br /><br />An eye-opening and disturbing element of Shaw's history is the body-count of people whose lives were taken or destroyed at the whim of a monarch. Throughout the book, people are beaten, starved, frozen, marched to death, or handed back and forth like trading cards. Thousands died in the construction of St Petersburg. Tall men from across the continent were kidnapped to Prussia to form Frederick William I's Potsdam Giant Guards. Other monarchs laughed at, or even enabled, this 'eccentricity.' As another review on this page notes, however, the death toll from monarchs is still far less than that exacted, in the twentieth century alone, by leaders acting in the name of the People. It may be outside the scope of Shaw's history to point that out, but it's still important to keep in mind that monarchies have tended to be far less sanguinary than 'dictatorships of the proletariat' are.<br /><br />I wish Shaw had included an index. But apart from that failing, this is a decent general survey of the seamy underside European royal history. Fans of the contemporary House of Windsor will want to read the evidence that suggests the domestic tableau of the post-Victorian British monarchy hides some secrets every bit as dark and troubling as those of the Wittlesbachs, Hohenzollerns, or Romanovs.across the continent were kidnapped to Prussia to form Frederick William I's Potsdam Giant Guards.

Kimmel and General Walter Short the scapegoats for what happened.<br /><br />Both elements are exposed to view in Michael Gannon's excellent book -- a fine addition to the Pearl Harbor bookshelf.<br /><br />Gannon does a very good job sorting out who was in possession of what intelligence information in the weeks and days leading up to the attack. The \\"betrayal\\" -- one of them, anyway -- was that, for a variety of reasons, much of that information never ended up in the hands of the on-scene commanders, who needed it most.<br /><br />As Gannon summarizes, \\"An Army Chief of Staff orders that no operational intelligence drawn from Magic be sent to his menaced commander in Hawaii, then later states that he was unaware that enemy intelligence was denied him ... An Army intelligence chief, representing the service specifically charged with defending the fleet at Pearl, punts on the grounds that fleet ships, after all, belong to the Navy ... A Navy war plans chief states that any transmission of operational intelligence of this kind should have been sent out by ONI [office of naval intelligence], something he himself never permitted to happen ... A director of naval intelligence discerns in bomb plot messages no more than Japanese curiosity and 'nicety' of detail about the time required for ships to sortie from harbor ... and a CNO [chief of naval operations], as uninformed at the time on this espionage as was the Army Chief of Staff, states four years later that ONI should have sent the information to Kimmel -- in direct violation of restraints that his own OpNav office had placed on ONI ... Surely, if ever there was a \\"fog of pre-war,\\" it hung over Washington in the fall of '41\\" (p. 195, ellipses in original).<br /><br />(Gannon firmly rejects the \\"Roosevelt knew\\" hypothesis. He also treats Stinnett's [[ASIN:0743201299 Day Of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor]] to only a paragraph or so of scathing analysis, noting in italics, \\"It is important to recognize that no naval operational message text in JN-25B [code] was read by the United States prior to 7 December\\" [p. 206].)<br /><br />But the intelligence failure was only part, albeit the largest part, of the \\"betrayal.\\" Early in the book, Gannon lists a damning catalog of the ways higher-ups in D.C rejected Kimmel and Short's pleas for men and materiel. More patrol planes? Denied. More AA guns? Denied. Money for more airstrips, so planes could be dispersed more widely? Sorry. Not in the budget. More radar installations? Maybe in the future. More trained gunners and patrol pilots? Sorry. We need them elsewhere. And on, and on, and on. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, don't give us the tools and we can't do the job.<br /><br />And yet, Kimmel and Short were scapegoated precisely for their alleged \\"failure\\" to do the job. In the end, Gannon explicitly declines to draw conclusions, leaving that, on his last page of text, to the reader. It may not be too much of a reach, though, to suggest that Gannon seems to agree with Admiral Raymond Spruance, whom Gannon quotes at the start of his final chapter: \\"I have always felt that Kimmel and Short were held responsible for Pearl Harbor in order that the American people might have no reason to lose confidence in their Government in Washington. This was probably justifiable under the circumstance at the time, but it does not justify forever damning these two fine officers\\" (p. 261).<br /><br />Personally, I think losing confidence in the \\"Government in Washington\\" is precisely the conclusion that *should* be drawn from Gannon's analysis, \\"circumstance at the time\\" be damned. As an illustration of bureaucracy's ability to shift blame away from itself and sweep unpleasant facts under the rug, the story of Pearl Harbor is unsurpassed. And Gannon is an excellent and insightful storyteller. I recommend this book to any student of Pearl Harbor.rug, the story of Pearl Harbor is unsurpassed.

I feel like I know him and what he stands for fairly well. This book of quotes is a pretty fair reflection of the true-blue mainstream, God-and-country conservative Kirby is (I've heard Floyd Brown on the radio a few times, and friends of mine are friends of his, but I don't know him nearly as well as I \\"know\\" Kirby).<br /><br />As other reviews on this page have noted, this is a great source of quick-fire ammunition for speakers and writers looking for pithy statements from a right-of-center standpoint. As you'd expect, there's a lot of Reagan here. A lot of Thatcher and Churchill, Jefferson, Burke, Eisenhower, Lincoln, Goldwater, and Theodore Roosevelt. Surprisingly, there are also a fair number of entries from people you wouldn't expect to find in a book of \\"conservative\\" quotes, including George Bernard Shaw, Louis Brandeis, Russell Long, William O. Douglas, and even Chairman Mao.<br /><br />That brings me to what I think is an important point to make about this book: While many of the quotes are, taken entirely on their own, expressions of conservative sentiments, \\"Say the Right Thing\\" isn't, by any stretch, a comprehensive treasury of conservative thought. Among the conservatives (or at least right-leaning people) I was surprised not to find included in this collection were: Albert Jay Nock, Murray Rothbard, John T. Flynn, Lysander Spooner, Robert A. Taft (the original \\"Mr. Republican\\"!), Isabel Paterson, Rose Wilder Lane, or Randolph Bourne (\\"War is the health of the state.\\"). Mises and Hayek have two and three entries respectively, Russell Kirk and Robert E. Lee (a surprise, given that Kirby's an American-historian from Virginia) none at all.<br /><br />Still, as a handy reference for reliable quotes, 'Say the Right Thing' is a good title to have around. It's organized into logical sections, and also indexed by name -- although the index could have used another pass by the editor: there are separate entries for 'HL Mencken' and 'Henry Mencken,' as well as 'Napoleon I' and 'Napoleon Bonaparte.' Republican speakers and newsletter editors, I'd bet, would find this especially useful.<br /><br />If you're looking for other powerful quotes combined with an easy-to-digest look at politics and philosophy, I very highly recommend [[ASIN:0671611593 Dreams Come Due: Government and Economics As If Freedom Mattered]] by the pseudonymous 'John Galt.' Despite the author's nom de plume, it's not as Randian/Objectivist as it sounds.indexed by name -- although the index could have used another pass by the editor: there are separate entries for 'HL Mencken' and 'Henry Mencken,' as well as 'Napoleon I' and 'Napoleon Bonaparte.'

And that has allowed her to present a moving, lyrical portrait of Ronald Reagan that not only reminds so many of us of what we loved about him, but lets us share her understanding in a way that other writers, blinded by their grudges and political biases, have never been able to. That seems to be her goal: to get us to understand the man -- the experiences that shaped him, and the way he lived his life -- as she does.<br />The book is full of insights -- wonderful, revealing insights like the observation that nobody who really knew Reagan, from whatever part of the political spectrum, ever thought he was unkind or dishonest or untrustworthy. Only the people who never knew him said that [p. 83].  Or the comment that no other president, from FDR to Bush II (Truman possibly excepted), had as broad and varied a background in economics -- not as an academic discipline, but as an experience of life [p. 104].<br />The book is full of stories, too. Warm, moving stories like the one about President-elect Reagan hanging up the Christmas lights on his California home, or clearing brush on his ranch, or welcoming elderly Frances Green, whom he had never met, to the Oval Office: 'Frances! If I'd known you were coming, I'd have come out there to get you myself!'<br />Ms Noonan looks in-depth at some of the key issues in Reagan's terms of office, including Iran-Contra and the arms reduction talks with the Soviets. But the particular strength of the book is in tracing Reagan's preparation for the presidency ... in the ways his character was shaped by battling Communists in Hollywood (something else the Left sneers about), or watching his first marriage collapse, or finding his perfect partner in Nancy Davis.<br />This isn't the definitive Reagan biography. But it may well be the definitive portrait of the man -- and certainly the best one yet produced by someone who knew and worked with him first-hand.<br />It's a clich&eacute; to say, 'You'll laugh, you'll cry.' But if you have even residual love, or admiration, or sympathy, or even interest in Ronald Reagan, you will find yourself deeply moved by this book.

That makes this look at America's on-scene military leaders on the Day of Infamy particularly insightful, and Captain Beach's opinions particularly worthy of respect.<br />Almost from the moment the bombs stopped falling, the rush was on to hold someone responsible for the catastrophe. Anxious to draw attention away from errors (or, according to some, deliberate policy decisions) by senior officials in Washington, D.C., government investigators and their defenders fingered Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter Short, the commanders in Hawaii, as the men to blame.<br />Beach sees this as accusation as a slur on the memories of two competent and dedicated officers. Kimmel and Short, Beach argues, did the best they could with the incomplete information and insufficient tools they were given. Beach does not subscribe to the 'Roosevelt knew' school of thought, though he does argue that Roosevelt's policies regarding Japan made war inevitable. Beach's main criticisms are directed at America's military and diplomatic intelligence services, short-sighted budget priorities, and political pressure to 'make someone pay' for what happened.<br />Very useful in its own right is Beach's concluding 'References' section, in which he shares his thoughts on nearly three dozen books, articles, and government reports on the Pearl Harbor attack. Toland, Prange, Clausen, George Morgenstern, and other key pillars of Pearl Harbor historiography are all covered in this chapter.<br />Author of the classic navy story 'Run Silent, Run Deep,' Captain Beach is a skilled writer as well as a keen observer, and the prose in this relatively short book never lags. 'Scapegoats' helped start the movement, still ongoing in Congress and elsewhere, to rehabilitate Kimmel's and Short's reputations, and clear their names of six decades of tarnish and shame. Beach ably makes a strong case for righting this wrong as soon as possible.names of six decades of tarnish and shame.

It's an hour-by-hour, and in some cases minute-by-minute, account of events around the world on the Day of Infamy, December 7, 1941. Each hour receives its own chapter, with a graphic at the start of each chapter indicating the time in various cities around the globe.<br /><br />Weintraub, an excellent biographer and storyteller, does not break new ground attempting either to exonerate or assign blame. Instead, he places the day's events into the larger context of global war, showing how news of the attack was received and acted on in various locations. This is a valuable reminder that war had been raging for more than two years when the Japanese attack launched America into the conflict.<br /><br />This book is not the most comprehensive look at what happened at Pearl Harbor itself, but there are many other books with that focus (I recommend Prange's [[ASIN:0070506825 December 7, 1941: The Day the Japanese Attacked Pearl Harbor]]). \\"Long Day's Journey...\\" helps recreate the confusion, the \\"fog of war,\\" that surrounds great events, and helps us understand how the attack affected lives worldwide.<br /><br />I think this is useful and rewarding addition to the Pearl Harbor student's reference shelf.	2001-12-07

Instead, he approaches this mainly as a storyteller, presenting us with 'a moment in time' (as cheesy TV anchor-people might put it) in the lives of real people. People like me interested in root causes will do well to study Prange and Toland and Stinnett and all the rest. But keep coming back to Lord, to remind you that for all the talk of geopolitical strategy, individual human lives were changed (or ended) forever because of the attack.<br />If you're not interested in wading through thousands of pages of historical argument and just want a vivid portrait of the day of the attack, I cannot recommend Lord too highly. It's a great place for anyone interested in the attack to discover, or rediscover, what happened that fateful morning.	2001-12-07

Clausen was a special investigator for Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson during World War II, with authority to question anyone, anywhere, to get to the bottom of what happened at Pearl Harbor ... and, more specifically, to determine whether any military officials lied to the various Congressional investigations of the attack. He presented his boss with an 800-page report, later published as Volume 35 of the official government report on the attack. Five decades later (this book was first published in 1992), Clausen is still defending the approved, government-issue-circa-1946 interpretation of events.<br /><br />Clausen himself identifies what's wrong with his book in his Foreword: 'In writing the behind-the-scenes story of my investigations at Pearl Harbor, I do so not as a historian but as an insider. I also do so as a lawyer... Facts are the nails that the prosecutor uses to seal his case for the jury.'<br /><br />It's precisely because Clausen is (was?) an attorney and an insider that he believes he can render a 'Final Judgement' about the attack. Historians, on the other hand, recognize that history is never 'sealed.' Like any prosecutor -- especially a self-proclaimed insider -- Clausen's goal is to represent his employer, the government. This is particularly evident in the zeal with which he defends the government's decades long fingering of Admiral Kimmel and General Short as the men primarily responsible for the disaster on December 7.<br /><br />Clausen's objectivity is also brought into question by his frequent praise of his boss Secretary Stimson ('one of the greatest public servants in the history of America' [p. 238]). How clear-sighted is Clausen likely to be when pronouncing 'final judgment' on circumstances where his mentor and friend played a key role and arguably bears a share of guilt?<br /><br />To give credit where it's due, Clausen is a skilled attorney.  The first-person story of his investigations is an interesting one, and a useful addition to Pearl Harbor historiography. Add his contributions to the larger picture of the attack, but don't let him convince you that he's come anywhere near a 'final judgment.'.

Prange's Pearl Harbor trilogy. \\"Verdict of History,\\" in which he shifts his focus from \\"what happened\\" to \\"why it happened,\\" however, is more troubling. Prange himself died before the publication of his trilogy. The work was finished by his two co-authors, Goldstein and Dillon, and so I'm tempted to hold them responsible for the things I find most disappointing in this volume.<br /><br />Part of the problem is the title, which I hope Prange himself didn't have a hand in. As Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn sagely pointed out in [[ASIN:B000XG4YNA Liberty or Equality: The Challenge of Our Times]], the verdict of *history* and the verdict of *historians* are two (often very different) things. I would hope a historian of Prange's skill would not be so presumptuous as to claim to speak for all history. The opinions of talented historians are valuable. But relatively few judgments can ever be final (Henry Clausen's Pearl Harbor book has this problem in spades).<br /><br />The larger issue seems to have been the release, after Prange's death, of John Toland's [[ASIN:0413498204 Infamy]] which breathed new life into the so-called \\"revisionist\\" theory that Franklin Roosevelt knew of and/or deliberately provoked the attack. According to their introduction to this volume, Goldstein and Dillon deliberately expanded and refocused Prange's work in order to respond more thoroughly to the \\"revisionist anti-Roosevelt thesis,\\" which they reject.<br /><br />They concede that Roosevelt \\"might have been ill-advised\\" or insufficiently \\"dynamic\\" in his leadership. But their central thesis is the mainstream one that Pearl Harbor was due to sub-standard naval and military intelligence systems and failures by the on-scene commanders.<br /><br />In the end, though, Prange is at pains to point out something that often is overlooked in the \\"who do we blame\\" debate: the magnitude of the Japanese achievement. Pearl Harbor was a massive strategic undertaking -- one the Imperial Navy executed nearly to perfection. Students of the attack do well to remember that attention rightly focuses on the Japanese side of the equation as much as on the American.<br /><br />I've read a lot of Pearl Harbor history, and recommend Stinnett's recent [[ASIN:0743201299 Day Of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor]], which I think adds some important information to the debate. But I readily admit I don't believe anyone has all the answers yet.

In spite of this, though, Breit and Ransom give us a comprehensive look at these men and their work -- enough to understand their place in the pantheon of economic thought. They also show how that thought has stood the test of time and the assaults of competing theories. And while the authors' editorializing is light, they are also willing to point out how these economic ideas have been employed in the political arena.<br />In all, a great textbook for an Intro to Economic Thought class, and a valuable tool for someone wishing to understand the paths the 'dismal science' has traveled over time.	2001-12-04

As monarch of the world's largest economic and military power, it's no surprise that her children and grandchildren married into nearly all the royal families of Europe, affecting history for generations to come.<br />What's more surprising is that that the unprepossessing sovereign of a weak and relatively backwater continental kingdom achieved essentially the same feat. It's the story of this sovereign, King Christian IX of Denmark, and his family, that Theo Aronson tells in this excellent and revealing book.<br />Prince Christian of Denmark was not expected to become king until a series of 'fortunate circumstances' made him heir in 1852. He succeeded to the throne in 1863. At his death in 1906, his children or grandchildren sat on the thrones of Great Britain, Russia, Norway, Greece and, of course, Denmark itself. Later generations of his descendants would add the thrones of Belgium, Spain, Romania, and Yugoslavia to the list, as well as the titular throne of Hanover. Christian's youngest son had been offered, and refused, the throne of Bulgaria.<br />How Christian and his family achieved all this is just a part of Aronson's fascinating tale. Not a biography of the King himself, it is in fact a portrait of an entire family, including his daughters Queen Alexandra of Great Britain and Empress Marie Feodorovna of Russia and their children. It is also a fascinating portrait of their times, and of the impact (great in some cases, limited in others) royal families can have on their nations and governments.<br />Aronson paints Christian and his family as by and large sympathetic characters. Though imbued with a deep anti-Prussianism, they also tended to be unaffected, cheerful, approachable (once or twice with tragic consequences) -- in short, very different from the stuffy and pretentious scions of some other royal houses. It was a pleasure to get to know them, and to trace their lives and influences over the decades.ces over the decades.	2001-12-04

We have lots and lots of photos of King George V and Queen Mary, but the entire Russian Imperial family is crammed into four pages. The Austro-Hungarians receive but two.<br />The photos themselves are overwhelmingly posed formal portraits, while most of the rest are of royal personages at public events and ceremonies. I was hoping for more candid and private, family shots, to help the reader discover more about the various royals as real, flesh-and-blood people. But no such luck.<br />The captions are similarly disappointing. While Trevor Hall clearly knows his geneology, and can trace marriages and family alliances with ease, he tells us little about the people in the portraits beyond who they married and from whom they were descended.<br />As someone who reads a fair amount of European royal history, it's nice to be able to put faces to the names I encounter. But sadly, I found this photo album to be good for little more than that.	2001-11-29

Truscott describes him as 'conservative,' talking about 'valor' and 'honor' and 'the warrior culture.' A Southerner, he once drove a car with a Confederate Battle Flag license plate and, horror upon horrors, had relatives who attended VMI and even ... The Citadel!<br />In Lucian Truscott's world, women are heroic and men are weak and flawed (except our hero Ry Slaight and, interestingly, non-combat arms Army types like pathologists and lawyers). Men who oppose political correctness or question placing women in combat are, ipso facto, sexist/racist/homophobic hypocrites, and probably rapists and murderers too. No doubt it makes life easier to see things this way, but it doesn't leave room for a well-crafted novel. (For example, feel free to skip over Chapter 21 entirely. It's an anti-Republican screed that adds almost nothing to the storyline.)<br />Truscott's background and experience allow him to create a vivid atmospheric portrait of the West Point setting. But the statues on the Plain are more three-dimensional than the characters in this novel. For a responsible (non-fiction) balance to Truscott's political agenda, I recommend 'The Kinder, Gentler Military' by Stephanie Gutmann (Scribner, 2000).	2001-11-27

While his focus tends to lean toward economic matters, you don't need to be a specialist to understand his arguments.<br /><br />Most entertaining are the many brief quotations Galt uses to open each chapter. Ranging from Will Rogers and Kin Hubbard (\\"If there's anything a public servant hates to do, it's something for the public.\\") to Murray Rothbard and H.L. Mencken (\\"A good politician is as unthinkable as an honest burglar.\\"), these set the flavor for the chapter to come.

Flynn writes, &#34;There is a kind of little man who will tell you that he can't hit a nail straight with a hammer, but who loves to spread a big country like the United States out before him on top of a table, pull up a chair and sit down to rearrange the whole thing to suit his heart's desire. Through the providence of God this kind of fellow, in a country of practical politicians, does not ordinarily get into a spot where he can play this game.&#34;<br /><br />Leland D. Baldwin has done literally this in &#34;Reframing the Constitution,&#34; a shining example of 1970s establishment liberalism. He is convinced that the problem with America's original Constitution is a lack of centralized efficiency. With an airy wave of his hand, he erases the 50 states from the political map and replaces them with sixteen new states -- provinces, really -- administering such programs as the central government sees fit to devolve upon them. Under Baldwin's reframed Constitution, all power flows from the top down.<br /><br />But that's just the start. Baldwin also rearranges the Congress, creates a new head of government with the president chosen by Congress, and elevates the Chief Justice to head of state. Then he issues a new Bill of Rights that (needless to say) breathes not a word about antiquated ideas like the right to keep and bear arms.<br /><br />I have to grant that there are a number of interesting ideas in this book -- ones I've found worth thinking about in my own moments of imaginary nation-building. But Baldwin has too many false premises, and they lead inevitable to bad analysis and worse conclusions. For example, he makes a false distinction between &#34;human rights&#34; and &#34;property rights.&#34; Elsewhere, he complains that the division of sovereignty between the states and the central government, and the system of checks and balances we all learned about in elementary school, &#34;ensure that the government will be dilatory, cumbersome, and ineffective.&#34;<br /><br />While it has a few good ideas, this thin book is too weighted down by its own incorrect assumptions to be anything more than a monument of 1970s State-worship.rned about in elementary school, &#34;ensure that the government will be dilatory, cumbersome, and ineffective.&#34;  While it has a few good ideas, this thin book is too weighted down by its own incorrect assumptions to be anything more than a monument of 1970s State-worship.	2001-11-16

Today, as words like 'war,' 'treason,' and 'patriotism' are once again in the headlines, flags are flying, and nationalist feeling runs high, these essays by Twain, and commentary by Jim Zwick, are as important and timely as they were nearly a hundred years ago.<br />Back then, at the birth of the American Empire, Samuel Clemens ('Mark Twain') risked his reputation, his career, and his fortune taking an uncompromising public stand against the war in the Philippines. No pacifist, Twain nevertheless refused to allow jingoists, imperialists, and flag-wavers to define America's proper role in the world. 'I am opposed to having the eagle put its talons on any other land,' he wrote.<br />Twain's anti-war essays had never been collected in one place before this book, and many of the writings here were never published at all. Twain takes the reader's breath away with his bold and uncompromising resistance to empire. 'The War Prayer' (1905) should be required reading in Congress and on talk radio, while 'Roosevelt, the American Gentleman' (1906) should be engraved on TR's tombstone.<br />And then there's 'patriotism.' In 'Monarchical and Republican Patriotism' (1908), Twain defines the former as the government telling the people what is and is not 'respectable' patriotism. 'In the other, neither the government nor the entire nation is privileged to dictate to any individual what the form of his patriotism shall be.'<br />He continues: 'We have adopted [monarchical patriotism] with all its servility, with an unimportant change in wording: &quot;Our country, right or wrong!&quot; We have thrown away the most valuable asset we had:  the individual's right to oppose both flag and country when he (just *he*, by himself) believed them to be in the wrong.

The problem is the good parts are embedded -- like a fly in amber -- in a conceit that never really clicked: PJ's homage to Oliver Wendell Holmes's 'The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table.'<br />What PJ has done here is create a semi-fictional community, and embedded his essays (&agrave; la Holmes) as monologues delivered to these family members, friends, neighbors, and his long-suffering assistant, Max. To his credit, PJ is very up-front about what he's trying to do. In the Acknowledgements, he writes, 'Holmes pulled this [conceit] off with so much wit and charm that there was only one way I could pay his idea the compliment it deserved. I swiped it.' Like a successful actor or director, PJ seems to be in a position to get his publisher to indulge his personal pet projects. Like Holmes, PJ is witty. Charming, I guess, is a matter of taste. I found it dull and contrived, and skipped over it as quickly as I could in order to get to the actual essays.<br />The good news here is that most of the essays are PJ in fine form. Fans of 'Parliament of Whores' will savor his coverage of the United Nations Millennium Summit. And if you enjoyed his deconstruction of Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter's tome way back when, you'll prize the way he tears apart 'Guidelines for Bias-Free Writing' and (especially) 'It Takes a Village.' ('The village is Washington. You are the child.').<br />Interestingly, the parts I found most funny were those that involved, or were suggested by, Christopher Buckley. The Blind (Drunk) Wine Taste Test and the section titled 'Who the F___ Are They?' are, for pure humor writing, some of the best things in the book.<br />It was Christopher Buckley who coined the equation PJ = SJ [Perelman] + LSD, but you won't find much of the latter in this book. The author of the classic 'How to Drive Fast on Drugs while Getting Your Wing-Wang Squeezed and Not Spill Your Drink' now finds himself writing about childcare, the stock market, and the vicissitudes of home computers. These are some of the sections I skimmed over, as PJ veered terrifyingly close to (Lord have mercy) Andy Rooney-dom.<br />Despite those scares, though, there is still great material here.

Mr Langworth is to be commended for the remarkable amount of work that went into compiling this comprehensive Guide. It is a volume that belongs on the shelf of any student of Churchilliana.	2001-11-12

Jefferson has Dumas Malone, Lincoln has Carl Sandburg, and Bill Clinton has Barbara Olson -- the biographer who, if there's any justice in the world (for him, if not for her), will be associated with his name for the rest of time.<br />Olson's final book is a chronicling of the last weeks of Bill and Hillary Clinton's co-presidency. She gives us a quick, but important, survey of a number of Clintonian outrages, including massive land and power-grabs, Senator-to-be Hillary's shameless and desperate panhandling of expensive gifts before she fell under the Senate's ethics rules, and Slick's international 'farewell tour' of foreign countries -- a field trip that cost taxpayers billions and gained us, diplomatically, less than nothing.<br />But where Olson's analysis really shines is in her efforts to get to the bottom of 'Pardongate,' the wave of commutations, clemencies, and pardons that Clinton dished out, some literally in his last minutes in office. About a quarter of the book is spent detailing Clinton's most outrageous pardon, that of multi-billion dollar tax cheat Marc Rich. The last quarter or so discusses his other pardons, handed out to a rogue's gallery consisting largely of relatives, business partners, ex-girlfriends, Cabinet members, and cocaine dealers.<br />Even as skilled a reporter as Barbara Olson is at a loss to explain why Clinton chose to pardon who he did, or why he consulted so few people before issuing the pardons. One of Olson's theses -- both provocative and believable -- is that Clinton was so outraged at being compelled, on his last full day in office, to sign a deal with the independent counsel admitting his wrongdoing in the Lewinsky case and disbarring himself from the practice of law, that Clinton chose to lash out at his own 'persecutors' by granting clemency to criminals whom police and prosecutors had spent years pursuing. As one of Clinton's own Justice Department lawyers noted, 'He [Clinton] just can't stand law enforcement' (p. 141).<br />Ultimately, Olson helps us put Clinton in context, marshalling observers from Left and Right before drawing her own conclusions. Forrest McDonald, acclaimed historian of the American presidency, asks simply, 'What did [Clinton] get done? Was there any major legislation he was responsible for? ... Everyone approves of what he's doing, but no one can say anything he did' (p. 212). More directly, Andrew Sullivan of The New Republic notes, 'In Bill Clinton, we had for eight years a truly irrational person in the White House, someone who, I think, lived on the edge of serious mental illness. He was and is a psychologically sick man' (p. 199).<br />It's clear to see why -- if reports are correct -- Hillary Clinton was so anxious to get this book silenced following Barbara Olson's death. If, as it's said, people in democracies get the leaders they deserve, we can at least repay the favor by making sure our 'leaders' get the biographers they deserve. There's no question that Barbara Olson is the biographer Bill and Hillary Clinton deserve, and it's just one of many reasons to mourn her untimely death that she will no longer be able to chronicle this venal and dangerous politician ... and her husband, America's most corrupt president.<br />Let this book be (part of) her memorial.).<br />Ultimately, Olson helps us put Clinton in context, marshalling observers from Left and Right before drawing her own conclusions.

Within just a few years, the same people and institutions who railed against the 'imperial Congress' would find themselves in control of that institution. By that time, the White House was the enemy again, and Republicans devoted their energy and determination to rolling back the presidency and using Congress as an engine of 'reform.'<br />As a monument of that earlier, innocent era, this book has three elements: an indictment of Congressional abuses of power, an analysis of the 'separation of powers' doctrine, and policy prescriptions for the late 1980s and beyond. Of these, the last is largely outdated now and the first is incomplete: the problem isn't that Congress is too powerful vis-&agrave;-vis the presidency, or vice versa, but rather that *both* branches have far too much power (just for good measure, so does the judiciary), and *both* should be severely, brutally, uncompromisingly scaled back.<br />The middle element, the analysis of 'separation of powers,' still stands up fifteen years later, however, and is worth a read for students of political science.	2001-11-02

It definitely has the 'techno,' though.<br />Let me say up front that I don't think this is entirely author Jeffrey Richelson's fault. He is one of America's top historians of the intelligence community, and this book is exhaustively researched and documented (the first chapter alone has 173 endnotes). I just found the subject of all this research much less exciting than I thought it would be. For all their sci-tech wizardry, the 'wizards of Langley' were, at the end of the day, still a bunch of bureaucrats. Their battlefields were as much institutional as geopolitical, and that makes Richelson's story bureaucratic and institutional too.<br />Maybe I was spoiled by Bamford's 'Body of Secrets,' about the NSA, which combines technological detail with exciting stories of front-line espionage, but it seemed to me Richelson sometimes took too light a touch on interesting operational stories in order to get back to chronicling the CIA's changing organization chart. The attempted recovery of a sunken Soviet submarine, or the infamous BLUEBIRD-ARTICHOKE-MKDELTA experiments with mind-altering drugs, for example, were zipped over in just a couple of pages. It is true, though, that these topics are covered extensively in other books.<br />In all, I can see how 'The Wizards of Langley' will be useful for people interested in the personalities and politics behind a key element of America's intelligence apparatus.  Journalists or specialist historians, for example. But I'm afraid the general reader with an interest in intelligence operations may find this book rough, and even unrewarding, sledding. It's for that first group -- for whom this book could be an excellent resource -- that I'm giving it as high a rating as I am.	2001-10-30

The best alternative histories are the ones that run closest to what actually happened -- until the point where the author chooses the path untaken. From that standpoint, the ten stories in 'Rising Sun Victorious' are quite well done. Written by skilled military historians, none of these counterfactuals presume anything outside the realm of possibility (no aliens or time travel here).<br />Like scientists testing different theories, historians can use counterfactuals to shine new light on personalities and events. But not all historians start from the same premises. For example, Wade G. Dudley, one of the authors in this collection, notes 'it is difficult to imagine any simple set of circumstances that would have allowed Japan to win any form of victory in World War II' -- America's population and industrial strength inevitably would prevail eventually. On the other hand, James R. Arnold, another contributor, points out that if the bomb that struck USS Yorktown at Coral Sea had hit just twenty feet closer to her centerline, her flight deck would have been out of action for Midway -- with dire consequences for the US Navy. Counterfactuals are interesting; not just for the light they bring to history, but also for the way they illuminate the workings of historians' minds.<br />As in any collection, the quality of the chapters in 'Rising Sun Victorious' vary from author to author. I didn't find any of the submissions to be outright bad, but some were better written than others, some more plausible than others. As another reviewer notes, a few of the writers base their counterfactuals on obscure points in history. A general reader unfamiliar with the war in the Pacific may well not be able to tell where history and fiction part company. The specialist, however, can find between these covers much food for thought.<br />One of the games authors of counterfactuals play is inventing alternate biographies for real individuals. Attentive readers will note references to President Elmo Zumwalt, obscure naval memoirist 'G. Bush,' and a biography of Admiral Halsey by Dr John P. Ryan of the US Naval Academy, among others.ate biographies for real individuals. Attentive readers will note references to President Elmo Zumwalt, obscure naval memoirist 'G.

Three decades after its publication, Theo Aronson's entertaining 'Defiant Dynasty' is one of the best, if not the only, places to begin learning more about them.<br />Although Belgium has only existed as an independent kingdom since 1831, the small country has produced enough interesting dynasts to keep any dedicated royal-watcher entertained. The first king, Leopold I, was the uncle of Albert, the Prince Consort, and therefore familiar to any student of the life of Queen Victoria. His son, Leopold II, ran the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) like his private plantation, making him one of the most reviled men of his era.<br />Leopold II's sister Charlotte, meanwhile, made a splendid match, marrying Archduke Maximilian, brother of the Emperor of Austria. Soon, however, political machinations led to Maximilian becoming Emperor of Mexico, and Princess Charlotte, 'Empress Carlotta.' Urging her embattled husband not to surrender to the revolutionary forces of Benito Ju&aacute;rez, Carlotta returned to Europe to plead for military aid for her husband's tottering 'empire.' While in Europe, she received news of Maximilian's murder, beginning a descent into madness that ended only with her own death in seclusion, 60 years later, in 1927.<br />But that's still only a part of this dynasty's fascinating story. Aronson introduces us to King Albert I, a noble man in the truest sense (one historian described him as 'the best constitutional monarch who has ever reigned on the Continent of Europe'), who personally led his armies in the valiant, doomed, effort to resist German invaders in World War I; to Princess Stephanie, jilted wife of the restless Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria-Hungary; to the beautiful, beloved Princess Astrid of Sweden, bride of the future Leopold III, whose tragic death in a car accident triggered national grief akin to that following Diana, Princess of Wales' similar death decades later; and to Leopold III himself, who faced the wrenching decision of fight, flight, or surrender during World War II, and who paid for his choice with his throne.<br />Aronson's narrative ends in 1967, and much has happened in the decades since. But this book is a wonderful introduction to a dynasty that was never expected to survive, let alone thrive, in its task of reigning over a nation that itself was given, at its founding, little chance of success. Aronson's writing, even this early in his career, is entertaining and clear-eyed. He's not malicious, but neither does he pull punches in his descriptions of people and events. For students of monarchy wanting to look beyond the Scepter'd Isle, tracking down and reading this title is an excellent way to go.ggered national grief akin to that following Diana, Princess of Wales' similar death decades later; and to Leopold III himself, who faced the wrenching decision of fight, flight, or surrender during World War II, and who paid for his choice with his throne.<br />Aronson's narrative ends in 1967, and much has happened in the decades since.

A highly personal case becomes even more personal when attorney Maia Lee, the past love Tres never got over, arrives to defend Garrett and uncover facts about one of her own ex-clients.<br />I read 'Devil Went Down...', the fourth Tres Navarre title, immediately after finishing the first one, 'Big Red Tequila.' It's clear that author Rick Riordan's style and plotting have improved over time. Not that they were ever bad to start with -- far from it. But though still packed with Riordan's trademark twists and turns, the story in 'Devil Went Down...' was easier for me to follow than the often convoluted plots of earlier titles. Part of the difference may be that there seemed to be fewer characters to keep straight in this story.<br />There's one element of this book I'm not so sure about. From time to time, Riordan interrupts the narrative to include anonymous email messages. I won't spoil anything by saying what relevance, if any, these have to the story. But for the first time in the series, the reader has information that's not available to our narrator. As I said, I'm still not sure what I think of that.<br />On the other hand, I want to thank Rick Riordan for not allowing this novel's scuba-diving scenes to become James Bond-movie-style underwater mega-battle parodies. That would have been a tough hurdle for me to overcome.<br />This story takes place almost entirely in Austin, not Tres' hometown of San Antonio. But the South Texas atmosphere is still strong, Tres is maturing as a person (in his world) and as a fully drawn character (in ours), the other characterizations are solid, and the story itself is powerful. Of the four Navarre titles so far, the third and fourth have been my favorites. Which suggests that even greater things are to come -- he wrote hopefully.	2001-10-22

The suggested menus are good starting points for thinking about your own fiesta, while the 'equipment and ingredients' chapter is a sound introduction for folks unfamiliar with this type of cuisine. The instructions for making a margarita (seemed like a good thing to test) are straightforward, though the mention of adding one-quarter of an egg white for a 'frothy' mix struck me as sacrilegious, if not downright nauseating.<br />In all, an okay cookbook for people determined to have something about 'Mexican food' (as understood in the US) on their shelves. But us real Tex-Mex devotees are left wanting more.	2001-10-19

From there, our hero finds himself pulled into the worlds of drug dealing, family politics, and -- most deadly of all -- country music.<br />This title, like 'The Last King of Texas' (the third book in the series) starts off with a literal bang. But I found both 'Big Red Tequila' and 'Last King' easier stories to get into than this one was. Once the story starts moving, 'Widower's Two-Step' bears all the hallmarks of the Tres Navarre series: a plot that twists and turns, lots of characters (most with complex and hidden motivations), dramatic fights and confrontations, and truckloads of South Texas character. This book also introduces the Manos Detective Agency -- the employees of which have become regular characters in the Navarre series.<br />Devotees of the series will definitely want to read this title. I would recommend newcomers start with the first book ('Big Red Tequila') instead of dropping into the middle of the series, like I did. But even on its own merits, this interesting and atmospheric mystery is definitely worth a read or two.	2001-10-19

Now, he's come back home, hoping to answer the lingering questions once and for all. But then his former girlfriend mysteriously disappears, his other former girlfriend shows up to help in the search, and the police aren't interested in turning over old stones. Even Robert Johnson, Tres' taco-eating cat, is acting strangely.<br />This is the first book in Rick Riordan's Tres Navarre series, and it's not only a great story in its own right, but a strong lead off for what's proven to be a high-quality and exciting series. Riordan's plots can be tangled -- lots of plot twists, and characters with complex motivations -- but this is evidence of the high quality of the writing: Riordan proves he can handle both complexity and cohesiveness. Nevertheless, this book repays a second read.<br />'Big Red Tequila' is filled with San Antonio atmosphere, and while it helps a little for the reader to know the city, that's not essential to understanding and enjoying the story. Personally, I find myself with a margarita-and-tortillas craving every time I read a Tres Navarre book. But then, I'm a Texan by birth. Not everyone has that advantage, so maybe not everyone will respond the same way.<br />What I *can* say is that I've read three of the four Tres Navarre books currently in print, and am working on the fourth now. I didn't read them in order, so I can attest that each title stands alone as an exciting and rewarding mystery novel. I didn't get drawn into this one as quickly as I did 'The Last King of Texas' (the third title in the series), but the mystery and the character development moves quickly. If you're looking for a powerfully done series with sympathetic and engaging characters, rich atmospheric detail, and 'a plot that keeps you guessing,' I strongly recommend starting here.	2001-10-16

With the great attention being paid now to America's intelligence agencies and their alleged 'failures,' James Bamford's breakthrough 'Body of Secrets' has become a more important, interesting, and rewarding read than ever.<br />'Body of Secrets' is a fascinating mix of technical history, behind-the-scenes revelations, and action-packed storytelling. Much ink, and many more bytes, have been spilled about Bamford's description of the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty, but his depictions of Cold War confrontations, or 'sigint' (signals intelligence) work on the front lines of Viet Nam, are equally vivid. As with Robert Stinnett's 'Day of Deceit,' people may disagree about the conclusions drawn, but it's much harder to dispute the accounts and impressions of those who witnessed the events first-hand.<br />In nearly every chapter, Bamford uncovers new facts -- or draws old facts out of the shadows. A friend who recently commented that America 'won the Cold War without losing a life' would no doubt be shocked by Bamford's counting the cost, in blood and treasure, of America's secret wars. Others may be amazed or appalled by NSA's ability, amply explained in this book, to snoop on communications seemingly anywhere in the world -- including information, like this review, sent through cyberspace. (The recent revelation that the US government listened in on Osama bin Laden's cell phone conversations shortly before the 9-11 attacks came as no surprise to anyone who has read this book.)<br />NSA may or may not be America's most super-secret spy agency any more (the National Reconnaissance Office competes for that title too, and who knows how many others we haven't even heard of?), but it is clearly still a huge player in US defense and foreign policy circles. It also receives boatloads of tax money. All that makes Bamford's exhaustive discussion of NSA's history and current activities a must-read for any American concerned about the world and our nation's role in it.	2001-10-16

His classic 'Ideological Origins of the American Revolution' casts a huge shadow, not least over this small but valuable collection of 'personalities and themes in the struggle for American independence.'<br />Here, Bailyn gives us in-depth portraits of patriots John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Paine, as well as a fascinating portrayal of the loyalist Massachusetts governor Thomas Hutchinson, one of the leading Americans of his time but almost forgotten today. And he introduces us to Harbottle Dorr, a Boston shopkeeper whose writings give us a priceless look at how the Revolution affected middle-class Americans. Then, in a special chapter on religion and the Revolution, Bailyn writes about three preachers and their experience of, and influence on, the themes and issues of American independence.<br />The last two chapters, 'The Central Themes of the American Revolution,' and 'The Ideological Fulfillment of the American Revolution: A Commentary on the Constitution,' are alone worth the price of this volume.<br />History has no stage on which to play out its drama save in the lives of individuals (unless you're talking about geology or astrophysics, I guess, but why ruin a good epigram?). A student of the Revolution, or of intellectual history, would benefit much from this fine, though lesser-known, work of an excellent historian.	2001-10-11

The covert 'war in the shadows' between freedom and slavery is generally presented as a clash between governments: during the Cold War, it was NATO and the West versus the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact; CIA versus KGB; MI6 versus GRU. But why? Why couldn't there also be a private-sector organization, a collection of free agents, doing what the Free World's governments couldn't or wouldn't do?<br />That forms the basis of this fascinating book, part history, part autobiography, about Crozier's efforts, and those of his allies, to undermine and destroy international socialism on a private-sector basis.<br />Crozier is a journalist and political scientist, but also an experience intelligence hand and long-time advisor to governments. Motivated in part by Western spy agencies' bureaucratic incompetence, their penetration by Soviet moles, and their governments' 'own goals' and shortsighted legislative restrictions, Crozier struck out on his own. This book is chock-full of stories of disinformation campaigns, subversive tricks, and spy-versus-spy maneuvers that rank, in my mind, with some of the best of Ludlum or Le Carr&eacute;. Conservatives will also enjoy the eyewitness portraits of Reagan and Thatcher in action.<br />Very highly recommended to any student of espionage or the Cold War, or any fan of spy fiction.	2001-10-11

Coming off successful biographies of Queen Victoria, the Prince Consort, and other eminent Victorians, Stanley Weintraub has given us a fine biography of the Victorian era's most elderly 'child' of all, Albert Edward (aka 'Bertie'), the Prince of Wales.<br />Heir to the throne must be a difficult position in the best of circumstances and despite his luxuriant lifestyle, Bertie's circumstances were not the best. His mother decided early on that her eldest son was uneducable (Weintraub argues he was dyslexic), unreliable, untrustworthy, and at least partially at fault for the early death of the Prince Consort, the husband she worshipped. As the decades passed, she refused to modify this harsh judgment, viewing him as a wayward and unruly child even after the Prince was himself a grandfather. In fact, if never an intellectual like his father (Weintraub seems to doubt the Prince ever in his life read a book cover to cover), Bertie proved himself clever, sympathetic, popular with the people, and a fairly skilled, if unofficial, diplomat. Nevertheless, the Queen would not allow him access to state papers, or hand off to him any but the most minor of ceremonial duties.<br />Barred by custom from involvement in politics, and by his mother from any meaningful preparation for his inheritance, Bertie devoted himself to the one area he could influence the most, society. Weintraub's biography shines in its illustration of how the Prince's active social life, essentially frivolous in so many ways, nevertheless helped him discover talents and develop skills that served him in good stead as sovereign. And while never prurient, Weintraub is nevertheless comprehensive in his treatment of Bertie's many extramarital affairs, from his brief flings to his longstanding relationships with Lillie Langtry, Alice Keppel, and others (including, lest we forget, his beautiful and long-suffering wife, Princess Alix of Denmark).<br />Weintraub's picture of Albert Edward, in short, is a fully drawn one, and the reader can develop a fairly complete understanding of him as a man and as a Prince. I found him very human, disturbing and yet sympathetic.

Author Michael Farquhar, for his part, argues in his introduction that 'people with unlimited power and an inbred sense of their own superiority [tend] to misbehave.' And therein lies my main problem with this otherwise entertaining 'treasury' of scandalous stories.<br />Sure, this book is fun, in a voyeuristic People Magazine/Entertainment Tonight sort of way. As case studies of family feuds, sexual deviance, gross lusts, wanton cruelty, and all the rest, Farquhar seems to have missed little. Monarchs, as a class, may not be inherently any better or worse than the rest of us, but they certainly have more opportunities to cause trouble. And it's as a collection of stories about individual monarchs that I would be willing to recommend this book. But not as a complete picture of monarchy as an institution.<br />This book is colored by the author's own biases. He describes monarchy in his introduction as 'ridiculous and past its prime,' and the royal families of the modern era as 'faceless ... bland ... inane.' Of course, everyone's entitled to their opinion. More serious, though, is that Farquhar believes the behavior he chronicles was 'typical of a bygone era' of monarchy at its height. In other words, before 'the twentieth century [became] a slaughterhouse for European monarchy,' *all* kings and queens were more or less like this.<br />That's just not true. Christian history, for example, is filled with stories of royal saints and martyrs. Members of royal families have not only supported science, literature, and the arts with their patronage, but -- from Prince Henry the Navigator to Emperor Hirohito -- have themselves increased the sum of man's knowledge. Even 'faceless, bland' royal bureaucrats like King George V or Emperor Franz Josef had much to offer their nations.<br />So, yeah. By all means, read this book. Enjoy it. Laugh at the stories, roll your eyes, be shocked or get angry. I did. But don't let it single-handedly color your opinion of monarchy. As Emperor Maximilian said, monarchs are people too. Some of them have been bums, simpletons, lechers, criminals, bores, eccentrics, or just plain nasty. But as much chance as monarchs have to engage in scandalous behavior, so too do they have opportunity to do good. And I'd bet you could fill a book at least as long as this one with the stories of those who chose the second option.<br />It probably wouldn't sell as well, though.<br />(NOTE: Since posting this review, I have read 'Royal Babylon: The Alarming History of European Royalty' by Karl Shaw. It covers much the same ground as Farquhar's 'Treasury,' but in a much better way. Given a choice between these two titles, I would definitely recommend Shaw over Farquhar.)er their nations.<br />So, yeah. By all means, read this book. Enjoy it.

In most cases, these books seem to have the common approach of taking questionable insights and reducing them to trite slogans.<br />This book isn't like that. As an in-depth view of 'America's premier leadership school' (if it does say so itself), this book not only contains valuable lessons on leadership, but is also probably the best and most comprehensive book I've ever read on any of the federal service academies -- and I've read a few.<br />When the Army prepared to write a report on how leaders are developed at the US Military Academy (aka West Point), they discovered that, in fact, there wasn't any formal training doctrine at all. The lessons of leadership, and the means of transmitting them, had developed informally over time.<br />As a result, West Point cadets are not spoon-fed maxims and  'principles.' Instead, they're put in positions where they can draw conclusions and learn lessons via their own experiences. Ed Ruggero follows the same course: In telling us the stories of a handful of cadets during their journey through the Academy, he doesn't bludgeon us with 'The point of that was...' We learn as the cadets do -- and if we, or they, don't pick up some insights about leadership from this, maybe we, like they, aren't paying close enough attention.<br />As I said, this book isn't just about leadership. It's also an extremely good guide to the life of a cadet at the USMA.<br />Having recently read a book about The Citadel ('In Glory's Shadow' by Catherine Manegold), I was struck -- and hard -- by the vast difference between that school's 'adversarial' approach to cadet training, and West Point's team-based, but still rigorous, method. Of course, West Point used to be 'adversarial' too. But, as Ruggero explains, that approach has been abandoned, in part because it was judged a failure in preparing cadets for the 'real world' of commanding soldiers in the field. This book doesn't settle the Old Way Versus New Way debate by any means, but is a strong argument in favor of a training regime based on a desire to succeed, instead of fear of failure and (what some would call) abuse.<br />I would strongly encourage any young person interested in attending a service academy, or any parent of a current or prospective cadet, to buy this book and read it closely. MBA students and business leaders looking for leadership lessons from a school that has been training leaders for two centuries will find a lot to profit from too.ets for the 'real world' of commanding soldiers in the field.

It succeeds at none of them. As a result, it's is not only disjointed and confusing, but soaked through with bias as well.<br /><br />One the one hand, author Catherine S. Manegold, a defense reporter for The New York Times, writes of the fight over the admission of Shannon Faulkner to The Citadel as a metaphor of South versus North. At the same time, she presents the chronology of a legal battle. And a biography of Ms Faulkner. And a sociological study of life at a military college. If Ms Manegold had concentrated on any one of these things, the book might have been more successful.<br /><br />But apparently she couldn't decide which tack to take, and so the book ends up muddled. Long biographical introductions are given to people who end up playing minor parts in the drama. Lines are drawn for a conflict of cultures -- hidebound, traditional, inbred, hypocritical Charleston versus dynamic, hip, multicultural, liberal New York City -- but this allegory is abandoned as soon as it's developed. The central legal battles are disposed of in a series of &#34;the lawyers said ... the judges said,&#34; and then, hey presto!, Ms Faulkner is in the door.<br /><br />Ms Faulkner herself is the central figure in this drama, but at the end of the book, many questions about her remain unanswered. Did she apply to The Citadel purely on a whim, as it seems at first? Did she want the luster that comes with a Citadel ring (the ring is practically totemic), the &#34;network&#34; and &#34;connections,&#34; without understanding that the network depends on the shared experience of surviving the Citadel? Were her energies so focused on the legal fight that she was unprepared for what she found when she got in? When she left The Citadel, she complained that she had no friends in the school or the Corps. Was she really so naïve as to expect the school she and her lawyers had spent years attacking to offer her a warm embrace once she battered the doors down? None of these questions are adequately answered. It's not even clear whether the days Ms Faulkner spent in the infirmary were due to heat stroke, a mental or emotional breakdown, physical collapse, or something else entirely.<br /><br />Instead, we get strange asides, like the bizarre suggestion that harassment of Ms Faulkner was connected to Caribbean voodoo rituals. Or four irrelevant pages rehashing the charges against one of the Left's favorite targets, the School of the Americas.<br /><br />Interestingly, two of the most evocative sections of the book -- a harrowing account of Hell Week and the strangely moving epilogue &#34;Fear is like a Tree&#34; -- contain barely a mention of Ms Faulkner at all.<br /><br />Most Americans probably don't have real strong feelings about The Citadel one way or another. On the extremes, though, are people who really, really love the school, and others who really, really hate it. It's pretty clear whose side Ms Manegold is on.<br /><br />Unlike Dr Laura Fairchild Brodie, who wrote about the 'assimilation' of women at VMI, Ms Manegold is not &#34;the band director's wife.&#34; Not, that is, someone who knows the story from the inside or is even interested in seeing it from that angle. She appears not to have even residual sympathy for The Citadel as an institution, for the young men (and women) who attend it, or for the administrators wrestling with how to adapt to a society that has rejected nearly everything they value. Considering the patronizing, even sneering, tone she sometimes takes toward the military and people who serve in it, it's surprising Ms Manegold could have endured a career as a defense reporter.<br /><br />As Ms Manegold tells it, the original sin of The Citadel was to have been founded for the purpose of training militias in the suppression of slave revolts and the perpetuation of the planter-dominated caste system. The Citadel apparently is tainted by this sin forever, and neither the school nor the author can ever overcome it: she mentions it frequently, often gratuitously. After the War and the end of slavery, The Citadel turned inward, and cadets practiced on one another the social suppression and physical abuse they could no longer impose on slaves. This is what passes for sociological analysis in this book.<br /><br />That's too bad, because there is clearly an interesting and important story here. Maybe someday, someone will find a more effective, less polemical, way to tell it.the War and the end of slavery, The Citadel turned inward, and cadets practiced on one another the social suppression and physical abuse they could no longer impose on slaves.

The first will be, 'I didn't realize it was as bad as this.' The second, dawning more slowly, will be 'How long before it gets this bad *here* too?'<br />Peter Hitchens argues that during the last decades, broadly speaking the era between Sir Winston Churchill's funeral in 1965 and Diana, Princess of Wales's in 1997, Britain was abolished. Not the land mass itself, obviously, but instead everything -- everything -- that once defined what it meant to be British. In chapter after relentless chapter, Hitchens shows the march of 'modern' PC orthodoxy through the Anglican Church, the marriage and divorce laws, the television and radio, the education system. History, the political system, the language, ancient ideas of loyalty and patriotism, virtue and service, even the very shape of the land itself ... all have within living memory been reshaped into something new, different -- and completely divorced from the past.<br />Many people have noted these changes. Hitchens' contribution lies in showing that the changes were not coincidental, but instead were deliberate, orchestrated even, and that many of the same activists were behind the various facets of the assaults.<br />Again and again, Hitchens produces evidence showing the arrogance and self-righteousness of the self-anointed 'reformers.' Again and again, they say, 'We recognize that the British people love the old ways, and that there is no popular clamour for change. Nevertheless, change we must.' Hitchens argues that what the 'reformers' have never been able adequately to answer is, 'Why?' And more to the point, 'Why was it necessary to destroy the old way, and make the new way mandatory?'<br />Why, indeed? Why, for example, is Britain now jailing farmers and shopkeepers for using Imperial measurements instead of metric ones? Why is the government trying to abolish trial by jury and the right to self-defense?<br />Sad to say, this book, while insightful and spirited, is almost unrelievedly depressing. It is literally only in the last few paragraphs of the final chapter that Hitchens offers any sort of hopeful outlook ... and even then, it is only to suggest ways to keep the future from becoming yet bleaker. What has been destroyed has been destroyed forever.<br />Indeed, it's sad to note that in the year or so since this book came out, things in Britain have in fact gotten worse. Tony Blair has taken yet more steps toward a presidential style of government, shoving aside still further both the monarchy and the House of Commons. I'm sure Hitchens finds no joy in being a prophet, but he seems to be, unfortunately, on the right track.<br />For anyone who loves Britain -- and especially for Americans whose idea of Britain is shaped by 'Masterpiece Theatre' and other PBS offerings -- this sad, wonderful book serves as the gravestone of an idealized vision, and a warning to our own country.efense? <br />Sad to say, this book, while insightful and spirited, is almost unrelievedly depressing.

The Windsors dominate the scene, obviously, and we monoglots soon discover that English-language media cover other royal families only sporadically.<br />Then, once every ten years or so, a book comes out that focuses on once-and-maybe-(or maybe not) future sovereign dynasties, like the Greek, Italian, German, or French royal families. These books, however, seem usually to fall into one of two categories: fawning, or sneering ('Look at these losers who think they're still kings.')<br />Fortunately, Geoffrey Hindley's useful resource falls into neither of these categories. And that makes it well worth the read.<br />Hindley is an unabashed monarchist, and takes the position -- sadly rare these days -- that monarchs and their dynasties really do have something useful to offer their nations and their people. In a wide-ranging discussion of currently reigning royals, he shows how the various monarchs relate to the day-to-day business of their nation's governments, and measures their degree of influence, or outright power, both in public and behind the scenes.<br />His coverage of the pretenders is also thorough and informative. He wrestles with the questions of the Russian and French succession, the constitutional position of the never-abdicated King of the Hellenes (aka Greece) and his family, and reports on what may well turn out to have been the first steps toward restoration in Bulgaria.<br />As other reviews have noted, there are a few minor errors in history and genealogy. But these are more in the nature of typos, not serious flaws in research or argumentation.<br />The late Austrian writer Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn wrote of the natural inability of a North American to take monarchy seriously, either as a system or a philosophy. Yet for millions of Europeans (to say nothing of Asians and Africans), monarchy plays a central role in their history, their present, and most likely their future too.

If the author's name is recognized at all, it might be as the founder and president of the Media Research Center -- although in fact that L. Brent Bozell is this author's son. The subhead, 'A Conservative Becomes a Catholic,' might seem to limit the appeal to conservatives or Catholics or, most likely, conservative Catholics. And if the browser picked the book up and glanced through the pages, she would find references to the Vietnam War, Joe McCarthy, Pope Paul VI, Earl Warren, President Nixon, and other oh-so-dated names and barely-remembered controversies. Back on the shelf it would go.<br />What a mistake. What a loss to the insightful and curious soul.<br />Because the political and social analysis are only serve only to introduce Bozell's deeper concerns, his own philosophical and moral wrestling with the question of what it is to be and live as a Roman Catholic. He explores his own spiritual evolution -- his 'journey,' we would say today -- and applies his insights to questions that are just as important in the twenty-first century as they were in the 1960s and 70s, when most of these essays were written:<br />Is there such a thing as a distinctively Catholic philosophy of politics and economics? Does being a Catholic require one to be pro- (or anti-) capitalist, pro- (or anti-) Marxist? And in modern America, where the culture has rejected its Christian inheritance and, instead of persecuting believers ridicules, sneers at, or -- worst of all -- ignores them, what are Catholic Christians called to do?<br />I am neither Roman Catholic nor conservative (at least, not precisely in the way Bozell is). But I found much here to 'ponder in my heart.' I recommend it for Christians of any stripe concerned (as we all should be) with how our lives and our faith intersect contemporary culture.	2001-08-01

Unlike many traditionalists, Bishop Forester is defiant, not apologetic. He is not seeking compromise, but defending an ancient treasure. That makes his story surprisingly exciting to read.<br />An example: 'How can anyone dare stamp on other people's sentiments? Who has given them permission? &quot;The hankering after the Old Mass is pure sentimentality.&quot; Of course it is, and that is why it is sacrosanct.'<br />And again: ' The very volume of changes in the Church since Vatican II is sufficient to guarantee that most of them are for the worse. It is inconceivable that over the past two thousand years the Church has manifested and expressed the Faith so badly that any and every change must be for the better. If that were so, she would lose all credibility. What is conceivable, on the other hand, is that some of the changes may have been for the better and some not. But this possibility is one which we are not allowed even to discuss. To do so is disloyal, divisive, and conducive to schism. Every change is for the better; there has not been the least error, the slightest slip.'<br />Bishop Forester is a man of faith. His devotion to the old order of Roman Catholicism is not traditionalism-for-its-own-sake, but rather based on his faith in his Church and, above all, in his God. Even for a non-Catholic, there's much to learn, and much to think about, reading his letters. Even now, almost 15 years after first reading it, I'm still pondering Forester's comments about how many people's enduring view of Jesus Christ is of Him as a baby -- the Jesus of 'Away in a Manger' and 'Silent Night.' Thus, we live our lives looking down (literally and figuratively) at a helpless child, instead of looking up to the triumphant, conquering God on the Cross. Powerful stuff.<br />Bishop Forester asks many important questions about what it means to be a Christian in this day and age. Whether you're a Catholic or not -- whether you're a Christian or not -- I guarantee this book will leave you with a lot to think about.instead of looking up to the triumphant, conquering God on the Cross.

Reading Bill Sammon's insider history of Al Gore's 36-day scorched-earth campaign to wrest the presidency from George W. Bush brought back all the emotions -- anger, frustration, fear, resignation -- that we experienced the first time through. Whether that's a good thing or not is up to the individual reader to decide. But the fact that this episode took place in 'the greatest democracy on earth' makes this a story, however painful, that cannot and should not be ignored.<br />Sammon has gone behind the scenes, revealing not only the carefully thought-out schemes, but also the utter chaos, that characterized the Florida recount. He takes us back and forth from high-level strategy meetings to state and federal courtrooms, media newsrooms, even the decks of Navy ships in the Persian Gulf. It's an unpleasant story of the black arts of legal manipulation, media spin, and win-at-all-costs politics.<br />Most telling is Sammon's portrait of Al Gore, a man who, like Oakland, apparently has no 'there' there --  no independent existence outside politics. As Gore himself famously told members of his staff, 'If [Bush] wins or loses, life goes on [for him]. I'll do anything to win.' His campaign and legal staffs and his outriders in the media adopted this attitude, from the savage attack on Katherine Harris' appearance (aren't liberals supposed to be against 'lookism'?), to Gore lawyers' cheering whenever Bush ballots were tossed out of the farcical hand recounts, to Time magazine's Margaret Carlson describing sailors serving in a war zone as 'tax dodgers' who shouldn't even have the right to vote. Perhaps most disturbing of all was the Democrats' playing the race card, claiming in the face of all evidence that deliberate racial discrimination kept Gore supporters away from the polls. Sammons argues, though, that at the center of it all -- directing attacks, pulling strings, shaping strategy -- was Al Gore himself.<br />If there's a lighter side in all this, it has to be Dan Rather's increasingly bizarre pronouncements as the fight drags on. 'Frankly, we don't know whether to wind a watch or bark at the moon,' he intones at one point.<br />In all, this is not a story that will raise politics, or the men and women involved in it or reporting on it, in the estimation of many readers.

But when I choose a contemporary mystery, I tend to find myself drawn to authors whose stories have a strong sense of place: Margaret Truman in Washington, D.C., for example, or J.A. Jance here in Seattle. Now, I'm pleased to say, I can add San Antonio's Rick Riordan to the list.<br />Some of my family is in San Antonio, and it's where I went to school, so I found the setting of 'The Last King of Texas' very easy to embrace and understand. Riordan tosses out the names of local streets, landmarks, events, and personalities with an ease that may cause people unfamiliar with San Antonio a little confusion. But that shouldn't distract too much from this well crafted murder mystery.<br />The story itself is fast paced, and while there is a lot of fightin' and shootin' going on, the scenes are not disturbingly graphic. In fact, one of my main complaints with the story is that our P.I., Tres Navarre, sometimes seemed to have the superhuman qualities of a kung fu movie hero, able to single-handedly dispatch masses of bad guys with his lightning-fast moves. That slight unbelievability, however, did not extend into the story itself -- which, through all its twists and turns, remained believable and true to life. The solution to the mystery did not suggest itself too early, and was ultimately a satisfying payoff. Navarre himself is an attractive and likeable figure, and most of the other major characters, good and evil, were fully drawn.<br />Mark Twain famously called San Antonio 'one of America's four unique cities.' For anyone familiar with San Antonio, this novel will be an entertaining trip back. And even if you haven't been blessed with a trip to the Alamo City, you'll find yourself looking for the chips and margaritas to keep you company as you hurtle through this entertaining and exciting mystery. I will definitely be seeking out the two earlier Tres Navarre stories, the one after, and any more coming down the pike.any more coming down the pike.	2001-07-16

Based largely, it seems, on reports and statistics from government archives, Overy in fact deflates many of the recent revisionist interpretations of the Battle of Britain. At the same time, arguing as Thomas Fleming does in [[ASIN:0465024653 The New Dealers' War: FDR and the War Within World War II]] that &#34;memory is not history,&#34; Overy also challenges the rose-colored conventional wisdom that has accreted around the Battle in the years and decades since.<br /><br />The Battle of Britain, Overy argues, had no clear beginning and no clear end; the dates chosen by the government seem purely arbitrary. By and large, neither the British public nor the British leadership was aware they were fighting an epic battle while it was going on. There was no clear winner, and it was not in any sense a turning point in the war. &#34;[T]he Battle of Britain did not seriously weaken Germany and her allies, nor did it much reduce the scale of the threat facing Britain (and the Commonwealth) in 1940/41 ...&#34; (p. 113). At the same time, however, the battle was not a draw: the failure of the German air force to knock out the RAF or terror-bomb the population into capitulation directly deterred or prevented Hitler's planned Operation Sealion, the invasion of southern England.<br /><br />Countering the &#34;revisionists,&#34; Overy argues that Sealion was a real strategic plan, not a diversion to cover for the invasion of the Soviet Union. Similarly, he shows that the Nazi shift from targeting RAF bases and personnel to deliberate bombing of civilian targets was not Hitler's vengeance-crazed demand following the Allied bombing of Berlin, but was actually part of the Sealion strategic plan, and happened well *before* bombs fell on the German capital.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of this study is Overy's discussion, not only of the myths that have grown up since the end of the Battle of Britain, but also the myths that both sides were laboring under while the Battle was being fought. The RAF, for example, consistently overestimated -- in a huge way -- the number of enemy pilots and planes they faced (contrary to the modern myth of &#34;the Few,&#34; RAF fighter pilots outnumbered their German counterparts throughout the Battle). For their part, German planners grossly exaggerated the RAF's losses of planes and pilots, and overestimated the damage they had caused to Britain's airfields and industrial production.<br /><br />In all, Overy rejects modern arguments that Britain would have been better off had she negotiated peace before the Battle and the Blitz began. Overy's short essay demonstrates that Churchill was right when he stated that although it might not always have been clear what Britain was fighting for, if the British were to stop fighting, they (and the world) would soon find out.e grown up since the end of the Battle of Britain, but also the myths that both sides were laboring under while the Battle was being fought.

He had no role in planning or waging the war, and knew nothing about war crimes and outrages like the Rape of Nanking or the Bataan Death March. It was the personal intervention of the peace-loving Emperor, the story goes, who realized the war was lost, that finally forced the militarists to surrender. After the war, the US-imposed Japanese constitution marked a complete break with tradition, and the beginning of a new political and social structure for the Japanese nation.<br />Herbert Bix accepts none of this conventional wisdom. Working from a wealth of Japanese and American sources, including many government documents from both nations' archives, Bix argues that the standard history is a tissue of lies. Indeed, Hirohito seemed to have lived his whole life surrounded, masked, and protected by lies -- first by his own government, and later reinforced by the Americans, who needed him and his nation as allies (not always willing) in the Cold War struggle against the Soviet Union.<br />Instead of a conventional biography, 'Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan' is a sweeping piece of political history. Bix argues convincingly that from the beginning, Hirohito had tremendous influence on the direction of Japanese government policy. His ministers consulted him, and heeded his advice. For example, he favored expansion of the war in China in the 1930s, and although he sometimes issued orders limiting the army's activities there, refused to punish officers who exceeded or ignored his orders -- provided their disobedience yielded positive results.<br />Bix sustains a tremendous volume of detail throughout his volume -- more than can (or should) be covered in a brief review. I encourage you to read the book yourself. It more than repays the effort.<br />The relationship between the US and Japan is one of the central pillars of American foreign policy in the post-war era. Now, with the end of the Cold War, there are signs the Japanese people are less and less willing to remain an American satrapy -- for all intents and purposes still an occupied country -- any longer.

For anyone willing to expend a little effort to find a more accurate portrait of That Man in the White House, I hugely recommend this huge book.<br />Fleming's philosophy, explained early on, is that 'memory is not history.' Although many Americans -- particularly members of the so-called 'greatest generation' and their children -- still have fond memories of FDR, rank him among history's great leaders in war and peace, and defend his memory and legacy, Fleming argues that these rose-colored memories are not substitutes for fact. FDR was not a demigod. He was a man: a fallible man, a devious man, an arrogant and ambitious man, a political man in both the best and worst senses of that term, and -- for the last years of his life -- a very seriously ill man.<br />FDR, Fleming argues, embodied both sides of 'the profound dichotomy in American life,' the tension between the idealism of the Declaration of Independence and the myth of the Founding, and 'the often brutal realism' and hard-edged practicality that Americans have shown in times of crisis and opportunity like the settling of the frontier. Fleming argues Roosevelt manipulated both sides of the dichotomy to maneuver America into the war on the side of the Allies. The New Dealers in his administration supported him in this, hoping to make the war a crusade for a 'New Deal for the World,' the way the First World War was a crusade for democracy.<br />Once America was in the war, Roosevelt vacillated between the two poles of the 'profound dichotomy.' On the one hand, he publicly declared that 'Dr New Deal' had been replaced by 'Dr Win-The-War' as the physician who could cure the nations' ills, and sometimes seemed to have viewed the New Deal more as an electoral ploy than an ideological commitment (After one Roosevelt decision, New Dealer Harry Hopkins tellingly fumed, 'The New Deal has once again been sacrificed to the war effort.' Hopkins wanted the war to serve his ideological goals, not come ahead of them.)<br />On the other hand, Roosevelt clung with grim tenacity to his 'unconditional surrender' formula, despite anguished pleas from his military commanders, Winston Churchill, the anti-Hitler German resistance, and even the Pope that all he was doing was fueling the Nazis' propaganda machine, undermining any hope of an effective resistance, and guaranteeing millions of additional casualties.<br />Fleming traces the administration's internal battles between the New Dealers and the pragmatists -- battles that climaxed, in his view, in the 1944 jettisoning of Henry Wallace from the Democrats' vice-presidential nomination, the fight over the Allied terror-bombing of German and Japanese civilians (The Allies 'must exceed the Nazis in fury, ruthlessness, and efficiency,' Hopkins wrote.) culminating in the decision to use the atomic bomb, and Roosevelt's consistent, naïve belief that the Soviet Union could become a trustworthy post-war ally, if only he could 'get at' Stalin with his famous charm. He was reinforced in his belief by ideologically motivated naifs like Henry Wallace and, as the Venona transcripts later proved, Soviet agents in the inner circles of American government. Fleming argues that here, too, Europe paid the price for the New Dealers' blinkered view of history and politics.<br />If Fleming has a hero in this book, it is clearly Missouri Senator Harry Truman. No fan of Roosevelt, Truman and his Senate Committee investigated the administration's handling of the war effort and sharply criticized the New Dealers for their ideologically based running of the war effort. Of course, Truman would soon find himself tangled in the New Dealers' web, forced as president to cope with the consequences of the New Dealers' war.<br />Despite its heft, I found this an exciting and surprisingly fast read (the type is fairly large, and there is a lot of leading between the lines, so you shouldn't be intimidated by the size). I found myself saddened that I had finished the book -- a rare experience in non-fiction reading.  Many 'greatest generation'-ers, plus left-liberals and other partisans of Big Government, will not enjoy seeing their most sacred cow gored so effectively. But this excellent book is a valuable (and much needed) antidote to the waves of pro-FDR idolatry we've been subjected to for more than half a century, and an important reminder of the memories we've suppressed in our nostalgic remembrings of the 'Good War.'<br />Very, very highly recommended.st read (the type is fairly large, and there is a lot of leading between the lines, so you shouldn't be intimidated by the size).

Along the way, we rediscover her parish family (many of whom we met in 'Facing East'), go into a women's prison with a group of post-abortion counselors, discover the perplexing world of 'Christian death metal,' and much more. It's an awful clich&eacute; to say, 'You'll laugh, you'll cry,' but there is a lot in this book that's very funny, and a lot that's profoundly moving (see, for example, the chapter titled 'My Father').<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about Orthodox Christianity. While not a definitive survey of Orthodox theology and practice (as no doubt Mrs Mathewes-Green would be the first to tell you), it is a grand portrait of how one individual's, and one family's, life is embraced by Eastern Christianity.<br />I especially liked some of the incidental touches, quick little portraits of her family's three teenaged children, who have been raised much of their lives in Orthodoxy: the high school-aged son on the bus, reading a biography of St Theophan the Recluse; the oldest child defending Orthodoxy online and at her Roman Catholic college; and the youngest thinking a stranger must be Orthodox because he has a bumper sticker reading The Doors (the joke, actually pretty funny, is explained in the book).<br />More than that, though, I would also recommend this book -- if I weren't libertarian I might even try to force the book -- to people, especially Protestant Christians, who don't know, or maybe aren't interested in knowing, that there is another, very different and yet strangely familiar and comforting, way to worship Christ, just on the other side of the 'denominational' divide.<br />This, of course, is where many readers may become very uncomfortable with this book. America's dominant religious paradigm, of course, is Protestant, and perhaps its most visible religious 'subculture' is Evangelical Protestants. Mrs Mathewes-Green pulls no punches in comparing Evangelicalism and Orthodoxy -- for example, when she contrasts an Orthodox hymn ('Of the Father before the morning star thou wast begotten from the belly without mother before all ages, even though Arius did believe thee to be created, not God, classing thee in ignorance and impudence with creatures...') with the nursery-rhyme music and lyrics of the Evangelical 'P&amp;W' songs 'Mighty is our God!' and 'Celebrate Jesus!'<br />She notes that a popular Evangelical hymn ends with the refrain '... and I long to worship Thee.' Quoting her husband, an Orthodox priest, Mrs Mathewes-Green notes that back when they were Protestants, they, too, longed to worship God. The truth was, they didn't know how, though they suspected it had something to do with emotion. But now, the longing has subsided, replaced by 'something that feels just right, like a key in a lock. ... I was made for this.'<br />Even if this exciting, touching, educational book doesn't convert you to Orthodoxy, it's an encounter you're not likely to forget for a long time.orce the book -- to people, especially Protestant Christians, who don't know, or maybe aren't interested in knowing, that there is another, very different and yet strangely familiar and comforting, way to worship Christ, just on the other side of the 'denominational' divide.<br />This, of course, is where many readers may become very uncomfortable with this book.

But for a few years at the close of the nineteenth century, the question of whether America should acquire an empire as a result of the Spanish-American War was one of the most hotly debated topics in our political life. &#34;Twelve Against Empire&#34; discusses the most critical years of that debate, 1898-1900, and several men who opposed the steady drive toward imperialism and away, as many of them saw it, from America's historic ideals.<br /><br />For a number of reasons, these twelve men were largely ineffective, and Beisner does a good job of telling us why. Many of them, especially the crotchety &#34;Mugwumps,&#34; were more interested in complaining about the decline of American culture than in building an effective political movement (and boy, does that sound familiar!). Others, like former President Benjamin Harrison, were torn between party loyalty on one hand and anti-imperialist principles on the other. Ultimately, Harrison was only able to bring himself to criticize his Republican successor McKinley's imperialist policies *after* McKinley had been successfully reelected ... which of course mooted his criticism and dissipated what little power he may have had to shape events.<br /><br />Harrison is just one example of why the &#34;Twelve Against Empire&#34; had so little impact on history, and are largely forgotten today (even though the anti-imperialist debate continued in some quarters into the 1920s and beyond, the American Empire was a *fait accompli* by 1900). But so long as America remains an imperial power (and ask the Hawaiians about that some time), these men's names and ideas deserve to be exhumed from the dust heap of history and given an honest hearing.<br /><br />Beisner is to be commended for doing so, and I recommend his book. In fact, I would encourage reading it in conjunction with Ronald Radosh's [[ASIN:0671219014 Prophets on the Right: Profiles of Conservative Critics of American Globalism]], an excellent study of the next generation of men standing against the tide of America's global reach.names and ideas deserve to be exhumed from the dust heap of history and given an honest hearing.<br /><br />Beisner is to be commended for doing so, and I recommend his book.

'At Dawn We Slept' set the stage for the attack, and 'Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History' summarizes and draws conclusions. But this title, 'December 7, 1941,' tells the story of the attack itself, from the point of view of both American and Japanese planners, participants, and spectators.<br />Prange's research is stunning, and he presents his facts in a straightforward and non-sensationalist way. He doesn't point fingers or call names, he just lays things on the table. As someone who's read a fair amount of Pearl Harbor literature, I really appreciate that.<br />I recommend Prange's trilogy for anyone interested in serious Pearl Harbor scholarship.

Whereas in the West, 'the squeaky wheel gets the grease,' in Japan, 'the nail that sticks up gets hammered down.' And so, when after its defeat in World War Two, Japan had a 'peace constitution' imposed upon it by the American occupiers, and that constitution was endorsed by the Emperor and his government, the Japanese people began to abide by it.<br />But almost from the time the 'peace constitution' was imposed, the American occupiers began pressuring the Japanese to ignore it and assume a larger share of their own defense. Today, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, while arguably still illegal under their constitution, are one of the largest and best-organized military forces in Asia. Hoyt's book is a fascinating look at how this happened. While it is obviously somewhat out of date now (it was published in 1985, while the Japanese 'economic miracle' was still bubbling along), Hoyt's historical investigations are particularly useful and revealing.<br />He demonstrates how, in typical fashion, America encouraged Japan to beef up its military might while at the same time forcing them to remain a very junior partner in the defense relationship. As Hoyt was writing, the Soviet Union was the major threat in the Pacific. But even as the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (aka 'Navy') was once again cruising the Pacific as a unified fighting force, Japanese leaders were admitting to one another that American and Japanese interests were not, and are not, always identical, and deciding where to go from there.<br />Hoyt's definition of 'militarism' seems to involve a more assertive foreign policy, a national spirit that honors *bushido* and the values instilled in the 1930s and 40s, former members of the Imperial Army and Navy playing prominent roles in certain areas of public life, and the expansion of powerful industrial and financial combines. Hoyt does not argue that anyone in Japan is advocating the re-colonization of Manchuria, another march down the Malay Peninsula, or another attack on America.<br />This book is not 'anti-militarist.' Nor, for that matter, is it 'pro-militarist'. While clearly concerned about certain aspects of the rise of 'militarism,' Hoyt's tone is not hectoring, partisan, shrill, or even particularly alarmist. At the end, I felt like facts had been laid before me, and I was left to draw my own moral conclusions. I appreciate that.<br />Now the USSR has collapsed, and tensions between the United States and the Peoples Republic of China are on the rise. Will the U.S. try to compel Japan to continue its historic post-war role as American deputy in the Far East? Or will America yield to the demands (audible even as Hoyt wrote) to evacuate Okinawa and allow Japan to pursue its own interests and goals?

There's Our Hero, the young, handsome Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve officer, gallant and admired, but prematurely aged by harsh experience of war at sea. There's the crusty, martinet regular RN officer, recalled 'from the beach' by the needs of the Service, arrogant, unimaginative, willing to sacrifice the lives of his men for his own glory. And there's The Girl, the young beauty with the past obscured in shadows, about whom Our Hero dreams as he stands on the bridge of his motor torpedo boat during the long midnight watches in the dark, deadly waters of the Channel or the Med. Or, in this case, the Black Sea.<br />Within these types, Our Hero, Lieutenant Commander John Devane, is largely interchangeable with Sub-Lieutenant Royce of 'A Prayer for the Ship,' Commander Drummond of 'The Destroyers,' or any number of other Reeman heroes.<br />And yet, despite a certain element of predictability, Reeman stories never seem to grow old.<br />Maybe that's because he keeps finding new elements, new tensions. One of the new elements in 'Torpedo Run' is the setting, the Crimea. Commander Devane and his task force, 'Parthian,' have been sent to an obscure corner of the European war, in part to fight the Germans, but mostly to prove to the Soviets that the UK is committed to helping take the pressure off strained Soviet forces on the eastern front. Devane therefore has to mix diplomacy with his naval skills, and help the Russians fight their war while he also fights his own.<br />Devane's personal war introduces the second new element in 'Torpedo Run,' a fully drawn (or relatively so) enemy character. This is the ninth or tenth Reeman title I've read -- or, in this case, listened to -- but it's the first one I can recall where we are really introduced to, and taken into the mind of, Our Hero's principal antagonist. Korvettenkapitan Gerhard Linke is not, by any stretch, a sympathetic character. But we are allowed to hear his interior monologues, and see his mind at work. Unfortunately, Reeman only sustains this for a short time -- a chapter or two at most. By the climax of the story, Linke has faded back into the near-faceless obscurity afforded to most enemy personnel.<br />I've always said that what Reeman does best is paint scenes of war at sea. And 'Torpedo Run' is chock full of them. Nobody who enjoys his writing will be disappointed by this title.<br />Narrator David Rintoul does a nice job in the Chivers Audio Books recording. Unlike some books-on-tape narrators, he doesn't go over the top in his portrayal of character's voices (why do so many narrators have such a hard time doing adequate simulations of female voices?). He knows how to vary his pace and emphasis based on the needs of the narrative. Best of all, his voice often reminded me of Leonard Graves's, the narrator of the classic naval documentary, 'Victory at Sea' -- a program I grew up watching (in rerun), and which is still the standard by which all naval history and fiction is measured.

Thanks to John Shelton Reed and Dale Volberg Reed's great book, I've not only discovered I'm more Southern than I realized, but know a lot more about that section of the country than I did before.<br /><br />'1001 Things Everyone Should Know about the South' is a book anyone can open at random and start reading anywhere. But if you read it straight through, systematically, I'm willing to guarantee almost anyone they'll discover things about the South they never knew before.<br /><br />This book is not a fancied-up version of [[ASIN:1401601936 You Might Be A Redneck If...]].<br /><br />The Reeds are serious researchers and writers, and they look at the South through the lenses of history, geography, ethnology, linguistics, religion, art, music, literature, architecture, cooking, politics, economics, and more. There are the obligatory sections on the Confederacy and the War, of course, but the Reeds understand, as other historians and writers have also noted, that the CSA was a period of barely five years out of more than 400 years of Southern history. (One of the things everyone should know about the South is that there were European settlers in Virginia, Texas, and Florida before anyone save Native Americans had set foot on Plymouth Rock.) This is one of the things that made '1001 Things ...' a far more satisfying book for me than was Michael Andrew Grissom's [[ASIN:0882897616 Southern by the Grace of God]], which had a tendency to view everything through the prism of the War.<br /><br />There is an enormous amount of interesting material in this book, ranging from the difference between 'Cajun' and 'Creole,' to the differences in habits between Southerners and folks in other parts of the nation (northerners subscribe to more dog magazines but Southerners own more dogs), to regional differences in linguistics and cuisine (finally I've found someplace that explains regional varieties of barbecue, though as a loyal son of Texas I have to agree that brisket, not pork, is the proper barbecuing meat [#647]).<br /><br />Among the other interesting things I learned:  80 percent of Southern parents teach their children to say 'sir' and 'ma'am' to adults (mine sure did), whereas only 46 percent of non-Southern parents do [#148]; 80 percent of Southerners also admit to using 'you-all' or 'y'all' occasionally as the second person plural, whereas most non-Southerners almost never do [#147]; one of the characteristics of Southern writers is that many of them only discovered their 'Southernness' when they lived outside the South [#472 -- hey!

And for that, he deserves our thanks.<br />'The heart of this book,' Stinnett writes on page 258, is the assertion 'that a systematic plan had been in place long before Pearl Harbor that would climax with the attack.' As soon as the smoking ruins of the Pacific Fleet were extinguished in December, 1941, and ever since, many observers (Beard, Russett, Toland, etc.) have questioned whether FDR deliberately adopted a stance designed to provoke Japan into making the first 'overt act of war.' This aspect of Stinnett's argument is nothing new.<br />What *is* new is Stinnett's discovery of a memorandum by Arthur McCollum, a Navy lieutenant commander and Japan expert, outlining an eight-point scheme to back the Japanese into a corner and provoke an attack. Stinnet tracks the memo from McCollum to a naval strategist in the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) named Knox. From there, the trail goes cold, although Stinnett has circumstantial evidence that it traveled from Knox to ONI chief Captain Walter Anderson, USN, and thence to FDR himself.<br />Stinnett's argument is that FDR adopted McCollum's policy recommendations, thus setting America on the road to war with Japan. He can't prove this irrefutably, but you don't need the smoking gun to know there's a trout in the milk (to cruelly mix metaphors). Whether he needed McCollum to outline them for him or not, FDR unquestionably adopted policies, most significantly an embargo on trade with Japan, that any knowledgeable person should have seen would dramatically increase the likelihood of war. I wonder, therefore, whether McCollum's memo is as significant as Stinnett believes it is.<br />What is unquestionably significant, however, is the enormous volume of intercepted Japanese message traffic that Stinnett reports. For one reason or another (declassification of previously classified files, incomplete research, military cover-ups, etc.), much of the signal intelligence information in this book was previously unreported. And it is this mass of information that will have to be addressed, pro or con, by every serious writer on Pearl Harbor from now on.<br />Prior to 'Day of Deceit,' it was possible to argue that Roosevelt wanted to provoke Japan into striking the first blow, but that even he was surprised by the sudden, ferocious attack on Pearl Harbor.

When 'Magnum, P.I.' debuted in 1980, I was a junior-high school student who, several years before, had lived in Hawai`i. By the time it went off the air in 1988, I was a college student who had lived in Hawai`i a second time. 'Magnum' isn't just an icon of Eighties TV for me ... it's an icon of my youth.<br />Not that I'm trying to be dramatic. I've just always thought (still do) that 'Magnum' was a really good show. And one of the best things about it, to me, was the rapport of the four main characters. Even when Thomas and Higgins were blowing up each other's possessions, you could tell they had a fundamental like and respect for one another. I always believed that was true of the four actors as well, and suspected that Tom Selleck really is a great guy. I owe Larry Manetti a vote of thanks for proving that all my suspicions were correct.<br />There's a lot of name-dropping in this book, but hey -- that seems to be the way Manetti has lived his life. Lots of great actors guest-starred on the series, and the author has gotten to know many more, as well. I should make it clear to any interested reader that this book is NOT an in-depth 'companion' to the series: Manetti talks about the show, obviously, and discusses some of the development of his character, Orville 'Rick' Wright, and some of his more memorable scenes and episodes. And there is a reasonably helpful episode guide at the end of the book. But it's not the author's purpose to probe the development of Thomas Magnum's psyche, trace the evolving nature of the Magnum-Higgins relationship, or fill in the 'backstory' of the various characters.<br />No, Larry Manetti's purpose is to tell stories. And boy, does he. I could easily picture myself sitting at a table listening to Manetti tell these stories in person. From his early life on the edges of crime to encounters (and friendships) with some of the great names in Hollywood, he takes us on a great Ferrari ride. For any 'Magnum' fan, this is essential reading.<br />By the way, the Steak Lorenzo recipe is great.<br />And if you read this review, Mr Manetti, two things:<br />First, please add my name to the list of those who would LOVE to see a 'Magnum' reunion movie. I know it's not up to you, but still ...<br />And second, if you ever make it up to Seattle, I know a great little Italian place. Let's get some friends together and talk about Hawai`i in the mid-Eighties. It'll be great.br />By the way, the Steak Lorenzo recipe is great.<br />And if you read this review, Mr Manetti, two things:<br />First, please add my name to the list of those who would LOVE to see a 'Magnum' reunion movie.

Now, he's been put in charge of a captured German U-boat, and he and his crew have a top secret mission to fulfill. The catch: his own Royal Navy comrades don't know he's one of them, and the Germans are figuring out one of their subs is behaving strangely. Marshall has no friends to rely on. More even than the usual submarine commander, he is entirely on his own.<br />Douglas Reeman keeps finding new twists and turns to make his war-at-sea novels entertaining, and in this one, the psychological terrors of submarine warfare are magnified by the fact that sometimes it's your own Navy dropping depth bombs on you. By my count, this is Reeman's fourteenth novel, and he's definitely got his craft figured out by this point. You'll be drawn into this one.	2000-12-13

Impregnable from the sea, Singapore collapsed before a Japanese force fighting its way through the 'impenetrable' jungle of the Malay Peninsula. Only at the last moment did the civilians on Singapore realize the danger they were in. And then they'd do anything to get out.<br />This novel features two of Reeman's standard characters: the crusty, traditional, martinet career Royal Navy officer, and the young R.N. reserve officer, unpolished but skilled, and increasingly experienced as the war progresses. As is common in many Reeman novels, the tension between these two men drives much of the story in the early part of the book, until they both realize that, as another hero of the era might have put it, the problems of two little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. By the time they figure that out, they've got bigger problems, like how to make it out alive.<br />As noted, this novel has many of the things that cause some people to call Reeman's novels 'formulaic.' But I think it's a darn good formula, personally, and Reeman is a good enough story teller that even if some of the characters seem vaguely familiar, the story itself still draws you in and keeps you reading.	2000-12-13
2183804:US	53058008	RND9G9EMBIAFP	0967943302	64482544	The Texas Aggie Bonfire : Tradition and Tragedy at Texas A&M	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Comprehensive and Insightful but Not, Perhaps, Definitive	Maybe it's because I went to a college with no appreciable tradition of its own that I've grown so interested lately in tradition-filled schools like the Virginia Military Institute and Texas A&amp;M University. I picked up Irwin A. Tang's 'The Texas Aggie Bonfire' hoping to discover more about that tradition, and about the role of tradition at A&amp;M generally. I got both more and less than I bargained for.<br />In a note at the front of the book, the author writes that this is the first title released by 'The it Works' ('it' presumably being 'Irwin Tang'). 'Our company specializes in amplifying the voices, issues, and debates ignored, distorted, or unheard in the mainstream corporate media.' That manifesto symbolizes Tang's approach to the collapse of the Texas Aggie Bonfire on November 18, 1999, in which twelve A&amp;M students were killed. Tang's book is an insightful history, but it's a book with a purpose, too -- one that may not sit well with many members of the Aggie community, and arguably keeps it from being the definitive history of this tragic event.<br />Although Tang (a lifelong resident of Aggieland and an A&amp;M grad) doesn't leave a lot of doubt about his own opinion on Bonfire, he really spells it out in one of his interviews with an A&amp;M faculty member: 'My book proposes that the Texas A&amp;M culture is at the root of the Bonfire tragedy. Our way of doing things allowed for an unsupervised, unregulated, uninvestigated Bonfire. One component that compounded the dangerously independent nature of the Bonfire was the fact that it is extremely difficult and perhaps dangerous to one's career and possibly dangerous in other ways to criticize Bonfire, the Aggie way of doing things, or other Aggie traditions.'<br />Though I'm not sure I agree with all Tang's conclusions, I value and appreciate his willingness to swim against what is clearly the spring tide of Aggie opinion. Many Aggies may want to fling this book across a room, but I'd bet they would benefit a lot from reading it.<br />Tang notes that he began writing his book as the post-collapse investigation was still unfolding. I was concerned, therefore, that this book would be like so many of the 'instant' histories and biographies that appear on the shelves within weeks or months of an important event (or movie). I shouldn't have worried. Tang is a skilled journalist and apparently inexhaustible researcher (maybe *too* inexhaustible -- the in-depth history of Bonfire was a little more than I thought I really needed). His style of writing, however, leads to my biggest stylistic criticism: his annoying habit of switching back and forth between past and present tense, sometimes even within a single paragraph. 'The commission will have to...', 'Investigators must...', 'It remains to be seen if...'. Even the best journalist can use a skilled copy editor sometimes.<br />After reading Laura Fairchild Brodie's VMI book and Amy Efaw's 'Battle Dress,' I was not expecting to find myself exploring yet again the question of assimilating women into traditionally male preserves. But that's an aspect of the Bonfire story too. Unfortunately, Tang falls into the trap I commended Dr Brodie for avoiding: the temptation to analyze Bonfire/VMI in the terms of primitive tribal rituals. Fortunately, this brush with pop sociology is relatively brief.<br />All in all, Irwin Tang's book is not the broad-brush look at Aggie tradition I was expecting. However, his portrait of an institution muscle-bound by its own traditions is an insightful one. Is it a complete picture? Maybe not. But it is a clear-eyed one, and one I predict will be a crucial resource for future historians of a sad, dark day in Aggie history.benefit a lot from reading it.<br />Tang notes that he began writing his book as the post-collapse investigation was still unfolding.

This is the setting for Douglas Reeman's fourth book, as a special Royal Navy team is detailed into the Adriatic to destroy a Nazi floating drydock.<br />The pressures and tensions of undersea warfare make this book more of a psychological thriller than some of Reeman's other titles. Nevertheless, naval warfare is still Reeman's specialty, and this book doesn't lack for exciting scenes. This is an engrossing look at an area of naval conflict that is still too little explored.	2000-11-27

He tells the story of the War (including explaining why 'the War' means only one thing to true Southerners) and Reconstruction, paints moving portraits of Southern heroes, and recounts some Southern myths and folklore.<br />To someone familiar with other Southern-perspective histories of the War and its impact on the South, including Jefferson Davis' 'Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government,' Edward Pollard, or even the Kennedy brothers (not to mention unblinkered histories like Jeffery Rogers Hummel's 'Emancipating Slaves, Enslaving Free Men'), the central section of the book adds little that's new. Grissom helpfully includes a long bibliography, with recommendations for additional reading and study.<br />Perhaps the most interesting and evocative section of the book is Grissom's extensive collection of Southern photographs, most never before published, and nearly all dating from the War to the early years of the Twentieth Century.	2000-11-27

Saracen	Books	5	4	4	N	N	One Ship, One Man, Two Wars	Other reviewers of Reeman titles have noticed the formulaic nature of many of his novels. This title, the first Reeman story I ever read, is an entertaining departure from many of the elements Reeman fans have come to expect. Along with 'A Prayer for the Ship,' this is one of my favorite Reeman books.<br />HMS Saracen is a monitor, a type of ship already obsolete when it was launched and now almost entirely forgotten. Nevertheless, Saracen is Richard Chesnaye's first ship, and it is aboard her that he makes a name for himself during the Gallipoli campaign. Twenty-five years later, both the ship and the man are recalled to active service during Hitler's war. And while few people are willing to say anything good about the ugly old ship, Chesnaye sees an opportunity to prove the old girl still has one more heroic act left.<br />Reeman's picture of the fighting at Gallipoli is dramatic and affecting, plainting in Our Hero the seeds that drive him onward during the second war. The author resists the common flaw of making his hero too messianic: Chesnaye is sympathetic, but we can see his flaws.<br />All in all, a highly enjoyable, read, with all the author's usual skill in depicting the horror and the glory of war at sea.	2000-11-27

Typified by William F. Buckley and 'National Review' magazine, it advocated energetic opposition to Soviet expansionism -- an internationalist posture of military alliances, proxy conflicts, and 'war in the shadows.' Opposition to this policy came primarily, if not exclusively, from the Left.<br />Or so it seemed.<br />Now that the end of the Cold War has led to a 'conservative crack-up,' more voices on the Right are willing to risk being tarred 'isolationist' to stand up for a principled stand of non-interventionism, an approach Ronald Radosh quotes Nicholas von Hoffman as calling (speaking of the views of Sen. Robert A. Taft) 'a way to defend the country without destroying it, a way to be part of the world without running it.' In such a climate, the views of men like those described in this book are beginning to be rediscovered and re-appreciated.<br />Radosh's subjects -- Charles A. Beard, John T. Flynn, Oswald Garrison Villard, Sen. Robert A. Taft, and Lawrence Dennis -- cover both a relatively broad span of time and a wide ideological spectrum. Despite the subtitle's description of these men as 'conservative critics of American globalism,' several of them found themselves associating (or associated) with conservatives as a result of their criticisms, as opposed to their criticisms arising from an innately conservative philosophy. Beard, for example, advocated in the 1930s a centralized, planned economy. Villard, who began as a devoted free-marketeer, later was an enthusiastic supporter of the New Deal. One of the interesting strands of this book is watching how these men's political philosophies change and evolve (or devolve) over time.<br />Do these men have any relevance to us today? Absolutely. The so-called 'revisionist' viewpoint Beard and others brought to analysis of World Wars One and Two is now beginning to be applied to the Cold War too. More importantly, the internationalist thrust is still alive and well in American politics today -- the need for an articulate opposition is as great as ever.<br />For example: In his 'Conclusions,' Radosh notes that voices on the Left had arisen to criticize American involvement in Viet Nam (my edition of this book was published in 1975), using many of the same arguments the 'conservatives' had used to oppose interventionism in previous decades. Former assistant secretary of defense Paul Warnke is quoted as arguing that the Constitution 'cannot be read to give the President &quot;the right to carry on an air war in a civil conflict in a tiny country on the other side of the world.&quot;' And yet, a quarter-century later, when an American president decided to carry on an air war in a civil conflict in a tiny country on the other side of the world, the most articulate voices in opposition to it came from the Right -- from the intellectual heirs of the men in this book. That's what makes this important.<br />Today, the 'Buckleyite' wing of conservatism remains dominant. But as the conservative bloc continues to crumble, a wider variety of ideas and approaches will arise, all legitimate heirs of the 'conservative' mantle. A key to speeding the process along will be to acquaint conservatives (and the American people generally) with some of their silenced heroes, the voices in the wilderness profiled in this important book.alist thrust is still alive and well in American politics today -- the need for an articulate opposition is as great as ever. <br />For example: In his 'Conclusions,' Radosh notes that voices on the Left had arisen to criticize American involvement in Viet Nam (my edition of this book was published in 1975), using many of the same arguments the 'conservatives' had used to oppose interventionism in previous decades.

At the same time, the Reeman 'formula' has become more apparent as his titles pile up. This book, his first title, is still among my very favorite of his novels.<br />Probably at least in part autobiographical, what Reeman's first swing may lack in technical polish (and it doesn't lack much), he makes up for in his ability to tell an exciting story. I got caught up in the lives and war of the men of the MTB squadron, and the efforts of Sub-Lieutenant Royce to prove himself and create a place for himself among the war-hardened officers and men.<br />For some reason, I've always been attracted to the idea of small-boat warfare. Give me a PT boat over a battleship any day. If you're like me, or are just interested in an exciting story of the men (and women) caught up in the war at sea, Reeman is always a great author to turn to. And this title is one of his best.	2000-11-27

I imagine this book to be an invaluable resource for serving USMC officers, whether fresh out of The Basic School or with many years of service. But it has another use too: as a guide to the Corps for future Marines, and for non-Marines like me.<br />At first blush, much of the information in this book may seem obscure or even irrelevant for people not making a career in the Marine Corps: information about personnel folders and fitness reports, how to apply for and receive transit insurance, or how to render salutes when small boats pass close aboard. But even in these details, a sense of what it means to be a Marine comes through loud and clear.<br />For a non-Marine, the real value of this volume lies in two areas: (1) its explanations of the history and traditions of the Corps (Marines are often said to be the most history-conscious of all the services), and (2) the explanation of the role the Corps plays in America's military machine, including how the Corps is structured, trained, stationed, and led.<br />Non-Marines can also find much merit in the sections on the attributes of a leader, dealing with subordinates, the useful, if somewhat brief, bibliography, and the glossary of common USMC terms and slang.<br />If you are, or plan to be, a Marine officer, absolutely read this book.<br />If you're not a Marine, but are interested in the Corps, its history or its present functions, I recommend this guide very highly.<br />At one point, the author quotes General John A. Lejeune: 'The future success of the Marine Corps depends on two factors: first, an efficient performance of all the duties to which its officers and men may be assigned; second, promptly bringing this efficiency to the attention of the proper officials of the Government, and the American people.' LtCol Estes admirably succeeds in 'bringing this efficiency to the proper attention' of any civilian interested enough in the Corps to pick up this most valuable book.	2000-11-13

Reading this book is like reading a biography of someone still alive: you know the information you're getting is incomplete. The story isn't over yet.<br />In this case, most (or many?) of the women who entered the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in the second half of Dr Brodie's book are graduating in 2001. The questions the author asks about how the women will fare as upper-class cadets, and how they will relate to incoming rats, male and female, in later classes can now, more or less, be answered. This isn't really a criticism of the book, but more of a hope that someday we may see another volume, or at least an updated epilogue, that addresses these questions.<br />It's often said, in this book and elsewhere, that nobody who hasn't been through the ratline can ever really understand VMI. To a certain extent, that may well be true. But insofar as any one who hasn't had that experience can be an insider at VMI, Dr Brodie seems to be one. Dr Brodie introduces herself by saying 'I am the band director's wife.' But she's also an accomplished academic, a Ph.D., a professor, and a self-described feminist. I was pleasantly surprised, therefore, that Dr Brodie doesn't attempt, as other academic feminists have, to describe VMI in the sociological language of male tribal ritual, primitive societies, and the like.<br />Dr Brodie clearly has sympathy for the women in the ratline, and the males -- cadets, faculty, and administrators -- who tried to smooth their way into the Corps. At the same time, though, her tone on the whole is not censuring toward cadets and administrators who resisted 'assimilation.' (She seems to have less patience for anti-assimilation alumni, though that may be just my interpretation.) And she is even-handed in recounting the battles VMI has had with the Justice Department and the courts.<br />I picked up this book less because of my specific interest in the assimilation of women than because I was interested in learning what life at VMI is (was?) like -- culture, traditions, the daily experience of the Corps. Although shedding light on those topics was not Dr Brodie's main objective, I do think I have a much clearer picture of what goes on at one of America's most historic educational institutions.<br />My major disappointment with this book is all the more disturbing given Dr Brodie's academic background: there is no index and no bibliography. I hope these deficiencies (plus, as another review on this page notes, the stupidly reversed cover photo) can be remedied when a later edition comes out.ike -- culture, traditions, the daily experience of the Corps.

At that point, it becomes less a history text than a prosecution brief. &#34;Prince&#34; Michael lays out the case for his belief in a &#34;Hanoverian Conspiracy&#34; designed to suppress the fact that the legitimate sovereigns of independent Scotland lived, and continue to live to this day.<br /><br />Although Hilaire Belloc is not mentioned in the index, &#34;Prince&#34; Michael seems to agree with Belloc's argument that the so-called &#34;Glorious Revolution&#34; that placed the House of Orange on the throne marked the end of liberal, aristocratic, rights-based rule and the beginning of a commercial oligarchic republic that preserved the forms of the old order without any of their substance. However, development of this argument takes a back seat to &#34;Prince&#34; Michael's chronicle of several centuries of deliberate insult directed at the Stewart/Stuart succession.<br /><br />The weaknesses of &#34;Prince&#34; Michael's scholarship are mentioned in other reviews on this page. I was particularly bothered by the fact that in almost 500 pages of argument, there are fewer than 120 footnotes. Many of the footnotes he does give us are frustratingly unhelpful: &#34;The Vatican Archives, Rome,&#34; or &#34;Archives Napol&eacute;on, Paris.&#34; Contrast this with, for example, Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn's [[ASIN:0895265370 Leftism Revisited: From De Sade and Marx to Hitler and Pol Pot]], which has nearly 1,200 fully documented footnotes in just about the same amount of text as &#34;Prince&#34; Michael's book.<br /><br />&#34;Prince&#34; Michael's research relies to an unsettling extent on those traditional repositories of &#34;secret histories,&#34; the Masons and the Knights Templar. He even quotes Gardiner's [[ASIN:0760707359 Bloodline of the Holy Grail: the Hidden Lineage of Jesus Revealed]] -- a book for which &#34;Prince&#34; Michael himself wrote the foreword. Many of his most eye-catching assertions, like the one mentioned in another review that Scotland is &#34;geologically the most ancient land mass on the planet&#34; (p.11), are completely unsupported by citations or references. My favorite of these is the Abbot of Scone's alleged 1296 prophecy that &#34;Four scores and six hundred years it will take [ie, until 1976] before the Michael comes back to his inheritance&#34; (p. 55). And when did &#34;Prince&#34; Michael arrive in Scotland? In 1976! Wow!<br /><br />&#34;Prince&#34; Michael unwittingly summarizes the nature of his research when he unironically describes his discovery of the connection between the Egyptian pharaohs, the princes of Scythia, and Scotland: &#34;I awoke suddenly one night, knowing precisely who Kinkiris was. I immediately rushed to the [[ASIN:090042446X Guinness Book of Kings, Rulers and Statesmen]], and there indeed was our man: Pharaoh Akenkheres&#34; (p. 69). Who needs footnotes when you have divine revelation?<br /><br />I'll leave it to genealogists more skilled than I to sort through the tangle of ancestors he claims (there are insightful websites that do exactly this). I'll just note that a few years ago, a British magazine did a study to determine who would have the strongest claim to a resurrected Scots throne. After sorting through the relevant genealogical, historical, and legal precedents, they determined the person with the best claim to sit on the throne of Scotland is (drumroll) ...

Wow!  &#34;Prince&#34; Michael unwittingly summarizes the nature of his research when he unironically describes his discovery of the connection between the Egyptian pharaohs, the princes of Scythia, and Scotland: &#34;I awoke suddenly one night, knowing precisely who Kinkiris was. I immediately rushed to the [[ASIN:090042446X Guinness Book of Kings, Rulers and Statesmen]], and there indeed was our man: Pharaoh Akenkheres&#34; (p. 69). Who needs footnotes when you have divine revelation?  I'll leave it to genealogists more skilled than I to sort through the tangle of ancestors he claims (there are insightful websites that do exactly this). I'll just note that a few years ago, a British magazine did a study to determine who would have the strongest claim to a resurrected Scots throne. After sorting through the relevant genealogical, historical, and legal precedents, they determined the person with the best claim to sit on the throne of Scotland is (drumroll) ... Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. If this book is &#34;Prince&#34; Michael of Albany's appeal to overturn the court of history, the most charitable verdict can be Not Proven.	2000-10-31

If, instead of touring in London you're walking the dogs in Seattle (or wherever), you'll get a little less out of the experience. But I still think it's worth the trip for anyone interested in the history of one of the world's great cities.<br />I've seen Dr Hutton on various TV documentaries in the past, and had made a vague note to myself to look up his work. Listening to him on these tapes is as pleasant an experience as the AudioFile review on this page suggests, and I'm looking forward to delving into his written works.<br />I imagine this sort of tape to be British history the way many American tourists like it: Romantic, filled with monarchy and romance and treasure and death, with the occasional surprising fact, several of the guide's personal favorites thrown in, and over in an afternoon ... on to dinner in an 'authentic' English pub.<br />I don't mean to belittle these tapes, because I really quite enjoyed taking this trip with Dr Hutton. If and when I ever get back there, I would seriously consider taking these tapes with me and following the path he takes his listeners on. And I suppose that's really the point, isn't it?	2000-10-25

He seems to have made his peace with the profession now, but this is still an interesting and useful book that tells us as much, or more, about the author than it does about the art and science of building.<br />The Prince's opinions on architecture seem congruent with, for example, his more recent outspoken opposition to genetically modified food. As I've heard him described elsewhere, HRH seems to be a man not entirely comfortable with the twentieth (and now twenty-first) century. And a good thing, too: lots of discomforting things have come out of that century. While unpleasant architecture may not rank high on the scale of the twentieth century's crimes, one is reminded of Winston Churchill's saying that 'We shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.'<br />The Prince's central point is that modern architecture has lost sight of its surroundings. Rather than creating structures that harmonize with their location, using local materials and respecting the history of the site, many modern buildings seem determined to draw attention to themselves -- or rather, to their architects. Like any art, architecture is a matter of taste. But while you can hide a bad statue or painting, an ugly building is a blot on the landscape that's darn hard to avoid. My tastes must be very similar to HRH's, because when he described a certain library building, for example, as looking like a place where books are burned rather than preserved, I nearly stood and cheered.<br />It's hard to say whether the Prince's activism had, in the long run, any impact on British architecture or the architectural profession. But it was noble (not to say 'royal') of him to use his position to present a viewpoint that seems all too rare these days.	2000-10-25

If that's what you're looking for going in, this will most likely satisfy your curiosity.<br />Although the subtitle mentions the Grimaldi 'dynasty,' 70 percent or so of the book is about the, um, 'complex' personal lives of Princesses Caroline and Stephanie and Prince Albert, the three children of Rainier and Grace. There's little effort to put the dynasty or the principality in more than the immediate historical context, and although Rainier is frequently described as an absolute monarch or even 'Europe's last dictator' (which isn't even true), matters of state take a distinct back seat to the 'glamour, tragedy, and scandal.'<br />This is too bad. One of the most interesting assertions in the whole book was a comment from one of Glatt's sources to the effect that the Grimaldis were not becoming tawdry, but rather had always BEEN tawdry, and had hidden that fact behind a false front of elegance while Princess Grace was alive. I don't know if that's true or not: Glatt unfortunately lets the statement pass almost unanalyzed.<br />Glatt is to be commended, at least, for the variety of his sources, including several who (at least according to Glatt himself) had never spoken on the record before. While the book frequently reads like an extended essay in People magazine, Glatt avoids the temptation of acting omniscient about his subjects' thoughts and motivations. When they act inexplicably (which is disturbingly often), he says so. Glatt's tone is respectful and polite, but he didn't pull his punches. As someone who only paid cursory attention to the Grimaldis, I think I have a better understanding (and a lower opinion) of them as a result of this book.<br />A worthwhile read, all in all, for monarchy fans whose interests lie more in the personal than the political, the contemporary rather than the historical.	2000-10-25

He was the son of the future King Frederick VIII of Denmark. One of his aunts married the future Edward VII of Great Britain, and another married the future Tsar Alexander III of Russia. When Norway gained its independence from Sweden in 1905, the Norwegians chose Carl as their new King, and he was crowned as Haakon VII. He reigned from 1905 all the way until 1957.<br />I found this biography to be just the right mix (for me) of politics and personal life -- not so many details of government that I lost sight of the man, and not so much focus on personalities that the interesting tale of how (and why) a newly-independent nation chose its king is obscured. In short, this is a far better biography than most of the 'People Magazine'-style royal reportage one gets these days.<br />So far as I know, this is the only significant English-language biography of this monarch (though I'm certainly willing to be corrected). I would encourage any student of monarchy to read it, both as a study of an interesting and historically-significant person and as a study of how a monarch can play a critical role in a young nation looking to define itself on the world stage.	2000-10-16

Nobody should feel the obsessive need to trace his precise route along a map with a finger. That would probably be far more work than is necessary.<br />I listened to these tapes while walking our dogs in the evenings, and Mr Hillaby was a wonderful and entertaining companion. I sometimes wished he had spoken a little more about the historical significance of some of the landmarks he passed (and indeed, toward the end of the tapes, he does wonder if maybe he should have lingered a bit more at some of the more interesting sites), but on the whole, I found his mixture of history, ethnology and linguistics, botany and zoology, to be just about right. And his observations of the people he met on his trip were about the best part of all.<br />It's hard to compress two months' walking into several hours of tape, but Mr Hillaby has done a fine job. Whether you're walking yourself, or driving, or sitting at home or on the bus, I recommend taking this trip with him.	2000-10-12

Loaded to the Gunwale With Superpowered Quake-Stuff to Make Your Withers Quiver!<br />I found Bill Pronzini's first venture into 'alternative' crime fiction, 'Gun in Cheek,' consistently laugh-out-loud funny. In part, I think that may have been simple amazement that some of the gems Pronzini dug up were ever allowed into print in the first place. That sense of amazement had dimmed somewhat by the time I found 'Son of Gun in Cheek,' the follow-up to the first title. But this is still a worthwhile and entertaining read.<br />By Pronzini's own admission, this book isn't as well organized as the first one. But it is more personal, with the author's discussion of his youthful addiction to Charlie Chan movies, how he ventured into the dangerous world of mining alternative nuggets, and useful advice on how and where to find such gems ourselves.<br />But the best reason to read this book is still the excerpts from alternative classics, particularly the Hall of Fame titles Pronzini gives us. I would recommend pulling this book out on a rainy afternoon and opening just about anywhere. 'Son of Gun in Cheek' more than rewards the time put into it.<br />(By the way, the headline above is one of Pronzini's chapter titles. The chapter's about some alternative gold found in publishers' dust-jacket blurbs, and is one of the best in the book.)	2000-10-10

Many are blatantly pro- or anti- this or that Royal, or insider 'expos&eacute;s' from former valets or aides. This book isn't like that, and that makes it all the more worth reading.<br />Author Ilse Hayden looks at the Royal Family and the insititution of the British monarchy from the standpoint of a social anthropologist. She argues convincingly that the Sovereign's influence over government and society is both greater and more direct than is usually recognized. Much of that influence is camouflaged by ritual that seems to be ancient, but is really, for the most part, surprisingly modern.<br />Hayden takes a comprehensive view of Royal ritual, from big events like coronations and funerals, through Trooping the Colour, to bread-and-butter events like Royal visits and investitures. She also addresses questions like why The Queen carries a purse when she never uses cash, and what's up with the hats and white gloves. She also analyzes how the aristocracy both enhances and draws from the lustre of the Monarchy.<br />It's no exaggeration to say this book changed my view of the British Monarchy entirely. Whether you're monarchist, republican, or agnostic, you'll find valuable insights here. For anyone interested in moving beyond quick-and-dirty biographies to substantive analysis of what the Monarchy is really all about, you'll find true food for thought here.	2000-10-10

From its formation by King Henry VI, Eton's old boys consistently have become some of the most powerful or influential men in the Empire. Someday, God willing, one of its more recent graduates will become King.<br /><br />In his introduction, interviewer and editor Danny Dangizer (the British son of American parents and an Old Harrovian) writes, &#34;[T]here is something very un-English about Eton ... in that it leaves its boys with an unshakeable confidence in their own ability, combined with the conviction that anything in life is achievable. While these qualities may seem unpleasantly arrogant and mark Etonians as different, even from the products of other public schools that have neither the initiative nor the resources to indulge and fulfil every boy's expectations, the success rate of Etonians in their traditional fields is an inescapable fact of life: Etonians have great expectations -- and Etonians are rarely disappointed.&#34;<br /><br />Therein lies one of the weaknesses of this otherwise very interesting book. Danziger's comments sound like a self-fulfilling prophesy, given the 42 OEs he has interviewed. They include one former prime minister (Lord Home of the Hirsel, a/k/a Alec Douglas-Home), several rising (at the time of the interviews, anyway) politicians and potential prime ministers, a handful of bishops, well-known writers and artists, a general, two other Earls, three Lords .... in short, people who have indeed been successful &#34;in their traditional fields.&#34; It would have been interesting, and I believe given a more complete look at Eton, if Danziger had interviewed a dozen or so OEs who had not been so successful, for whom attending Eton may have been the high point of their social achievement ... or even men who had lived perfectly productive and honorable lives without ever becoming big names in the UK.<br /><br />Danziger has a very light hand in these interviews -- so much so that the chapters (each in the interviewee's own words) sometimes read a little abruptly, like a Q&A session with all the Qs removed. Danziger helpfully includes a glossary of Eton slang for people who may be unfamiliar with Library or Pop. Unfortunately, he doesn't provide the same service regarding the men he interviewed. If you don't know who Andrew Callendar, or The Hon. Jonathan Porritt, or Sir Ranulph Twistleton-Wykeham-Fiennes are, for example, you'll have to look them up yourself, because Danziger won't tell you.<br /><br />Despite that difficulty, however, I felt like I knew Eton better after reading these interviews. For someone who already knows a little bit about the 'Iolani of England and its history, I recommend this for additional reading.oductive and honorable lives without ever becoming big names in the UK.

It's to this book's credit that editor William Wolf and his contributors acknowledge this diversity from the start, and admit that, as Harvey H. Guthrie begins his essay, 'What &quot;Anglican&quot; means is hard to define.'<br />The key to understanding Anglicanism lies in the Book of Common Prayer, and in the fact, as contributor John E. Booty writes, 'the Church of England [places] corporate worship, including sacraments, before doctrine.' Admittedly, this is precisely one of the major criticisms other denominations level at Anglicanism. But here it is celebrated as a distinctive.<br />I first read this book back when I was an Episcopalian, and was looking for a deeper understanding of my tradition's approach to spirituality. From that standpoint, this book's primary benefit -- apart from its comprehensive historical approach -- was in pointing me back to the Book of Common Prayer. 'Anglican Spirituality' is not a how-to handbook for Anglicans seeking spiritual insights. It can, however, place Anglican spirituality in its historical and theological context. I would recommend this as part of a program of reading, including the Book of Common Prayer and Holloway's 'The Anglican Tradition' (which I've also reviewed), but would be reluctant to encourage the relative neophyte -- as I was -- to use this book as his sole reference.	2000-10-10

If the question has become more acute in the 15-plus years since this book was first published, Holloway's answer is even more important: the Anglican Communion (particularly the Episcopal Church branch of it in the USA) needs to re-ground itself in its traditions, theological, liturgical, and spiritual.<br />The essays in this book were originally presented as a series of lectures, and sometimes still read like lectures. But in the context, that's not troublesome. It gives the chapters a more intimate feel, and lets the authors cover a lot of ground without the reader feeling he is being overwhelmed by names, dates, or arguments.<br />Contributor John Macquarrie writes, '[W]hile the majority of Anglicans have been happy to refrain from close dogmatic definition, it does not follow that there is no recognizable Anglican position in theology or even a distinctively Anglican way to go about the theological task.' Anglicans would do well (all Christians would do well) to study Church history and their tradition's interpretations and approaches. Anglicanism can look particularly 'fuzzy' to outsiders, and many on the inside as well. I recommend this title as a useful tool for grounding new and old Anglicans alike to the distinctives of their Communion's traditions and practices.	2000-10-10

Men who oppose political correctness or question placing women in combat are, ipso facto, sexist/racist/homophobic hypocrites, and probably rapists and murderers too. No doubt it makes life easier to see things this way, but it doesn't leave room for a well-crafted novel. (For example, feel free to skip over Chapter 21 entirely. It's an anti-Republican screed that adds almost nothing to the storyline.)<br />Truscott's background and experience allow him to create a vivid atmospheric portrait of the federal academy setting. However, the statues on the Plain are more three-dimensional than the characters in this novel. For a responsible (non-fiction) balance to Truscott's political agenda, I recommend 'The Kinder, Gentler Military' by Stephanie Gutmann (Scribner, 2000).	2000-09-29

When I suddenly and inexplicably developed a need to learn all I could about 1951's Festival of Britain, this book was the only resource I could find. Fortunately, it had more than enough information to slake my thirst.<br />This book was written in 1976 in honor of the 25-year anniversary of the Festival. It's divided into sections focusing on various aspects of the Festival, from developing the idea, to planning, to architecture, and more. Each chapter was written by someone intimately involved with that aspect of the Festival, and so the book has real value as first-hand resource.<br />The book's conclusion seems to be that, whereas the Festival was intended to be the start of a new era for Britain, it in fact turned out to almost an era in itself, divorced both from what preceded it and what followed. By the time of the 25th anniversary, it seemed to have become irrelevant, and almost forgotten. I wonder if the 50th anniversary will even be observed at all.	2000-09-27

Layton used for his memoirs: [[ASIN:B0012VYUDY And I Was There: Pearl Harbor and Midway - Breaking the Secrets]]. As a USN reservist returned to active duty at Pearl Harbor just months before the attack, Holmes was there at the start of the war. And he remained near the center of naval intelligence activities in the Pacific until the end.<br /><br />My bigggest criticism of this book has nothing to do (directly) with Holmes himself. Like many memoirs written in the decades immediately after the war, this book is limited by the fact that much of the information Holmes would otherwise have been able to share was still officially secret. It would be for later researchers to say what Holmes couldn't.<br /><br />The other complaint I have is that, based on what I've read elsewhere, Holmes modestly understates the important role he played in the events he describes. It's to his credit that he's eager to praise talented and dedicated cryptologists and analysts. But Holmes frequently makes himself sound like someone standing on the sidelines watching the varsity team play. In fact, he was one of the team's key players.<br /><br />What could be a highly technical memoir is leavened by a light tone and entertaining asides, like his tales of trying to drive through Honolulu with darkened headlights (a feat he describes as probably a greater danger to the citizens of Honolulu than the Japanese attack was).<br /><br />Any student of the war in the Pacific, and particularly of Naval Intelligence operations or the attack on Pearl Harbor, will find this an interesting and entertaining memoir.	2000-09-27

But even if World War II had never happened, a strong case could be made that Churchill was one of the most influential and important British politicians of the Twentieth Century. Addison's excellent book shows why.<br />First elected to Parliament in the last days of Queen Victoria's reign, Churchill served until the time of the current Monarch. Addison covers all those years thoroughly, not only shedding new light on well-known incidents like Tonypandy, the General Strike, and Sidney Street, but also on less visible (but arguably more important) topics like Churchill's ongoing commitment to prison reform.<br />Like it was for his nation, World War II was Churchill's Finest Hour. But it was only about one-tenth of his storied career. Anyone who would have a well-rounded understanding of this well-rounded man needs to have Addison's book on his shelves.	2000-09-26

No doubt it makes life easier to see things this way, but it doesn't leave room for a well-crafted novel. (For example, feel free to skip over Chapter 21 entirely. It's an anti-Republican screed that adds almost nothing to the storyline.)<br />Truscott's background and experience allow him to create a vivid atmospheric portrait of the West Point setting. However, the statues on the Plain are more vivid than the characters in this novel. For a responsible (non-fiction) balance to Truscott's political agenda, I recommend 'The Kinder, Gentler Military' by Stephanie Gutmann (Scribner, 2000).	2000-09-25

Most of the emphasis is on the individuals who made up that history, and so whether you're researching Diana, Princess of  Wales, or Gruffydd ap Rhys I, Prince of Deheubarth (1090-1137), you'll find  at least enough info here to get you started.	1998-11-23

Books	4	19	30	N	Y	An important tool for setting the record straight	Kin Hubbard said &quot;'Tain't what a man don't know that hurts him; it's what he does know that just ain't so.&quot;  Much of what we Americans &quot;know&quot; about the causes, conduct, and consequences of the Civil  War &quot;just ain't so.&quot;  The Kennedy brothers make a strong case  that the real reasons for, and results of, the War Between the States have  been buried under the myth of Father Abraham and his blue-clad saints  marching south to save the Union and free the slaves.  Sure, the tone is  polemical.  But the &quot;enlightened&quot; elements of American opinion  have been engaging in a polemic against the South and its people for more  than 150 years.  It's a cop-out to criticise the tone, or call the authors  names, and ignore the historical record.  There's a lot in here to make the  Unreconstructed Southron give a rebel yell.  But more than that, this book  is a powerful reminder that facts are still facts, regardless of how many  decades of whitewash are slathered on top of them.	1998-11-23
