College of Pharmacy	As a graduate of the U.C. College of Pharmacy, I found this book most interesting and memory jogging.  It is a great undertaking that chronicals the history of the oldest school of pharmacy west of the Allegheny mountains.  The important book took a massive amount of work to compile, with the help of scores of individuals who are credited in the book.  The period from 1850 when Cincinnati College of Pharmacy was founded, through joining with U.C., to the offering of the Pharm D degree is covered.  History is divided into chapters to show the earliest years (1850-1871) to the Fennel Years, depression and war years, to the 4 &quot;Dean&quot; years.  A complete register of students by year and name, along with their degrees from 1873 to 2000 is provided !!  It is fascinating to review how the practice of pharmacy has changed dramatically over this period and how the curriculum has been updated to meet the changes,challenges, and the needs of patients.  14 pages of detailed notes regarding the book are provided.  Anyone believing that pharmacy is not a dynamic ever-changing profession will discover the truth in this volume.  Most intersting is the chronicalling of pharmacy education during its infancy all the way to the 21st century.  The University of Cincinnati periods are titled with the Deans' names:  The Kowalewski Years, The Glasser Years, The Warner Years, and the new century with the Acosta years.  There is a wealth of information in this book's 235 pages, along with some interesting pictures.  They brought back memories to me personally, from the mid to late 50's, with Dean Joe teaching the freshmen &quot;History of Pharmacy.&quot;  Dean Joe personally interviewed each student prior to admission, and knew each student by name, and the pharmacy where he or she worked.  This book is most informative, interesting, and well worth reading.	2004-07-12

I received this as a gift, and reading it made me pull myself up by the bootstraps and THINK.  Is there anything here that you didn't know before?  Probably not.  But there's plenty to think about and re-think as we go about our daily lives.  This book is a fast read with much food for thought, and the pictures are nice, too.  It makes you realize how much in our lives we take for granted, and how much time we spend on the least important. We tend to ignore the stuff that really counts and spend most of our time complaining and then rehashing the irritating and the unimportant.  That is, until some personal incident makes us realize how we or a friend or loved one comes to an end without enjoying the REALLY important fruits of life.  Anna sums it all up for me with her well known statement &quot;No man ever said on his deathbed I wish I had spent more time at the office.&quot;  Need I say more?  Read this book and pass it on to those you love.	2000-12-30

Most readers will have already read much of this in the press or  have heard it on the air.  In spite of this, I enjoyed looking at the 50  photos included, and found the text and writing-style pleasant and  interesting.  There are detailed accounts of his early days and later  family life, with some particularly interesting insights into his family  relationships.  His romances and political aspirations are examined.  The  book tends to give the reader a closer look at the life of John.  The very  detailed picture of what could have occurred as he flew on the fatal flight  does create some vivid images of what happened, but the details, of course,  are only guesses.  There are some clear views of what his last days were  like, and his concerns about his &quot;George Magazine&quot; and its  future.  Not a lot of new information, but nicely and concisely packaged  making it a desirable read.	2000-08-17

After reading, enjoying and writing my review of  Sylvia Browne's &quot;The Other Side and Back&quot; for Amazon.com, I was inspired to read  this book.  Her 249 page book details her interesting life and her special  gift of prophecy.  She describes what a psychic is, and how her life  revolves around this special God given &quot;gift.&quot;  This is a gift  that doesn't really make one's life easier.  She tells about how her gift  has helped her advise police departments searching for missing persons and  criminals, and how some of her predictions helped others avoid dangerous  situations.  She also struggles with tragedies that she warned about, which  resulted in deaths when her warnings were ignored.  This book may bring  comfort to believers (and some skeptics) and clarify their thinking about  the present and the future.  The book's 15 chapters include:  A Psychic in  Love, Growing Pains, Following the Blueprint, The Other Side, Haunting  Expressions, Why Am I Here, Medicine and the Medium, and more.  It's a very  interesting read, and you might find yourself going back and reading some  sections again in the future.  It is thought provoking, even if you're a  non-believer.  The work may even make a believer of you!  Whether or not  you believe in psychics, knowledge is power, and you can only gain with  this knowledge. Worth reading. I found it well worth the $ 10.36 price.	2000-08-03

Here is truly a story that can inspire everyone regardless the hopelessness of their situation.  I was held spellbound by this story and the way it was told.  I could personally relate to it well, as my 28 year  old son-in-law was faced with a similar situation and survived and  succeeded against all odds.  He was striken with a yet unknown illness that  kept him on life support for an extended period, with little hope from the  doctors for a successful recovery.  As pointed out by Lance in his book,  you should never give up.  Give it all you've got and you will succeed.  This book is a must read for all those with major problems and certainly  for those without the problems, but feel depressed by minor issues that  keep them from overcoming them to greater success.

I listened to the audio tape version of this latest work by Steve Chandler and found it to contain so much important information that I listened to the 3 hour tape twice.  Mr. Chandler personally reads his book to you in a  very calm, informed, understanding manner.  Very easy to listen to.  The  lies each of us tell ourselves on a daily basis prevent us from getting the  most from our lives. Steve really knows these lies, because he lived most  of them and was able to overcome them.  He helps us understand what we must  do to overcome the common lies and misconceptions and to be happier and  successful.  There's nothing difficult in what he recommends.  It's all  stuff we know, but never really zero in on these lies and therefore fail to  attain our goals. He shows us how we can overcome the lies to raise our  self-esteem, how we avoid taking action, and how we allow people to take  advantage of us and make us mad.  The many examples he provides hit home,  at least for me.  Mr. Chandler doesn't preach to you, but simply states the  facts and gives examples of everyday situations that keep us from achieving  our potential.  The information presented is simple enough for everyone to  understand.  The moment he gives an example, you can instantly relate to  similar things that happened in your own life.  Everyone can benefit from  this work, from teenagers to old timers.  Well worth the time.  Try it.	2000-07-26

The insurance  agent thinks that he has found the perfect crime and goes to any length  (including murders  made to look like accidents) to get his share of the  insurance loot.  &quot;Death Benefit&quot; is written in an easy to read  narrative style that lets you examine the minds of both the cat and the  mouse.  Not only is this work of fiction interesting, but it can encourage  you to look at your own real life insurance policies and your dealing with  insurance agents.  Well worth the reading.	2000-07-26

I read with fascination, popular psychic Sylvia Browne's new 304 page book that she says tells all about life after death.  The entire first chapter details her life and the lives of her ancestors as they relate to the  spirit world.  She goes into detail about HOW she knows what she knows. For  some reason, I tend to believe what she says!  Sylvia writes, that through  this book she is acting as our &quot;psychic travel agent&quot; answering  the five basic questions, &quot;How do I get there?&quot;, &quot;What does  it look like?&quot;, &quot;What are the local (people) like?&quot;,  &quot;What is there to do?&quot; and &quot;How exactly do I get back.&quot;  Things that most of us would be &quot;dying&quot; to know.  I have seen  Sylvia on TV many times, and find her fascinating.  This is a hard book to  put down after you start reading.  There's an awful lot of  &quot;facts&quot; she provides for us to consider.  It left me with a  peaceful feeling about the hereafter.  She believes that &quot;The Other  Side&quot; is Home, where we all came from and where we will all go again,  and that we carry very real memories of it in our spirit minds.  She has  researched her topics with an addiction, as she claims to be extremely  naturally skeptical.  She also claims that just as some folks have a  God-given musical or artistic talent, others have received a psychic gift  which is passed on from generation to generation. Whether or not you end up  believing what she writes, you can't help but come away with food for  thought.  Most interesting !	2000-07-26

I found this 192 page paperback book quite interesting, but I'm not sure that it would be of real value to me. I learned some things about the myriad of perils that could befall a human, BUT will I remember the facts  if one of these tragedies occurs to me sometime in the future.  I probably  would not have the book with me and handy at that moment, and I probably  wouldn't have the presence of mind to check the book if I had to jump from  a moving car or was being charged by a bull !  Many copies of this book  have been sold, so apparently some folks think they'll benefit by it.  Examples of perils include how to wrestle free from an alligator, excaping  a killer bee attack and performing a tracheotomy.  The 40 + worst-case  scenarios to survive could help you survive, but Lord help me if I had to  remember what to do if they did occur.  The book is worth looking at,  especially for those readers who are frequently exposed to dangerous  situations.	2000-06-27

Psychologist Bill Pollack spent much time and effort interviewing boys and young men all across the country to get them  to open up about all of the important things in their lives.  Topics range  from drugs, sex, sports, violence, ambition, school, parents, girls,  pressures, addictions, how they see the lives of the men they know,  importance of their parents, spirituality, friendships, being gay, coping  with divorce and other losses, and death.

He helps us  survive market &quot;melt-downs.&quot;  Also included is your own  &quot;personal prosperity plan&quot; for profiting in today's market.  Some  of the points take some concentration to understand, but it's worth the  try.  He shows you that with the information provided, the odds of success  are in your favor.  Every type of investor can benefit from the ChangeWave  Investing Method, whether you're the traditional investor, professional,  mutual fund buyer, or a new investor just getting your feet wet (and  sometimes your pocket picked).  Mr. Smith believes that now is the time to  be part of the market, even if you never were part in the past.  He notes  that his stock picking model has delivered over 150 % annual gains since  1995.  He says that this method combines a proven stock-picking model with  a new investment research &quot;operating system&quot; known as &quot;open  source investing,&quot; and the protocol should be considered as a software  program or application.  Can most investors perform all of the stock  research they need for successful portfolios? Obviously not.  Mr. Smith  says that every person can get what they need by &quot;booting up the open  source investing 'operating system' and launching the ChangeWave investing  model.&quot; He believes that the potential rewards available today, far  outweigh the risks of sitting on the sidelines.  It's sure worth a try.  I  intend to.	2000-06-05

Author Barry Sears makes it known that he believes that soy can improve your health and reduce your weight, so much so that he modified his famous and very popular &quot;Zone Diet&quot; to include a significant amount of  SOY.  &quot;The Soy Zone&quot; is a brand new book and is already getting a  lot of press and attention.  I am interested in getting as much information  about the value of soy, not so much from a weight loss standpoint, but for  overall improvement in health and for disease prevention. The author makes  some good points regarding soy's value that appear to be valid.  Much of  the current literature (professional and lay) point out soy's benefits for  better health.  Mr. Sears provides  many interesting recipes (in color)  from top chefs around the world that look tempting, and are worth trying.  He promises readers that those who follow his diet will think better, feel  more energized, look better, experience fewer sugar cravings and lose  weight after a few short weeks on his diet.

The knowledge you can gain from this 688 page volume can help your children get the kind of education that will be of value to them for the rest of their lives.  It provides a how-to-do-it guide for getting your  children successfully through the current U.S. educational system, properly  prepared for high school and beyond.  What greater gift can a parent offer  !  You'll discover what a &quot;well educated&quot; child should know, what  our responsibilities as parents are, and covers the major current issues in  our education system.  It not only covers academics, but also all of the  other factors that can affect a child's ability to learn.  Mr. Bennett even  gives us a yardstick to judge the quality of education provided by any  school.  His purpose is to help parents get a good education for their  children from early childhood through the 8th grade.  I believe that he  truly achieves that goal.  He points out what we as parents should stand  for in the school system and what we should not stand for.  The author  points out that the parent is the child's most important teacher, and the  problems with delegating educational responsibilities to others.  The  parent must instill the highest ideals in their children, and a strong  sense of responsibilty to really succeed in school and in life.  He  provides us with the rules for us to establish for our children, to help  them gain the most from their schooling, and how to direct them so they  know how to properly conduct themselves.  Mr. Bennett emphasizes that  elementary school has a far greater impact on our children, than higher  education, and notes that &quot;we ask elementary schools to help shape our  students' first and lasting ideas about themselves, their country, and the  world.&quot;  He notes that &quot;reading is the heart and soul of  elementary education.&quot;  He feels that educators today tend to  emphasize that students need to &quot;learn how to learn,&quot; and remain  vague about what they should learn.  The unruly atmosphere of our schools  is addressed.  He also covers the issues of teachers feeling that they work  with very little help from parents. The basics of what makes good students  and good schools is clearly spelled out for parents, and presents his  &quot;Ten Principles For Parents Of Educated Children.&quot;  This books is  a MUST READ, if you really want to help your children succeed, not just  with lip service, but it provides all the facts you'll need, if you just  expend a little effort.  Wow !hould learn.  The unruly atmosphere of our schools  is addressed.  He also covers the issues of teachers feeling that they work  with very little help from parents.

Dr. Edell hits a home run with this 304 page book that can really impact on your health and your quality of life.  I liked the way he stresses your need to avoid taking every health-news story as gospel and trying to  continually change your life style based on the latest &quot;facts&quot;  you get from the media.

The author Victor Klemperer clearly tells it how it really was for Jews in Nazi Germany from 1942 to 1945.  No, it's not the same details we're always horrified by.  It's the simple everyday &quot;normal&quot; activity restrictions that the Nazi's imposed on the Jews that hits home.  In  addition to the atrocities we're familiar with, Mr. Klemperer kept detailed  accounts of daily life for Jews.  For example, Jews could not buy flowers,  ride bikes or enter subways.  He describes the hard labor he was forced to  perform, in spite of the fact that he suffered from a heart ailment.  His  diary also details the many kindnesses performed by German citizens,  pointing out that there always remain some good folks among the bad.  This  book of over 550 pages takes some time to read.  But it is well worth the  time.  The author succeeds in providing a more vivid picture that we  perhaps had previously not seen.  Well worth reading . . .	2000-05-02

When I picked this book up and read the back cover, it sounded interesting enough, so I began scanning the chapters for some of the details.  The fact is, that I couldn't stop reading the entire book. It is a fascinating saga of how a great, young American (a Green Beret, in fact) can be falsely  accused of a crime, and the story that results.  I was impressed by the  clear picture that Mike Yon paints in every chapter.  When I finished the  book I felt that I knew him personally, and could relate to many of the  situations in his life.  Danger Close is a book well worth reading.  You'll  share each of his emotions, from happpiness to sadness.

Most of our successes will come as  the result of how we deal with change and adapt to it.

This book  can help you see change as a positive thing, yielding positive results for  you.

It  will help you stay ahead of the pack, enjoying the tasty morsels while your  colleages are still knawing at the unopened wrapper !	2000-05-01

The nutritional health guru provides his latest work in the 307 pages of food facts, fads, fantasies and feelings.  Dr. Weil really is an authority on health and alternative health care and is in a position to help us improve our well-being through appropriate choices of how and what we  choose to eat.  His major emphasis is on safety, and the best ways to lose  weight, diet affecting your energy levels and sleep abilities; and how  foods can cause or help ailments.  For dieters, he helps you evaluate  reducing aids and weight loss programs.  For those interested in learning  more about good nutrition, there's a wealth of good info provided.  Many  &quot;Optimum Diet&quot; menus are provided, along with a wealth of menus  that you can use at home and away.  We can all be better consumers, by  following his specific advice on reading labels.  Much helpful information  presented clarifies some of the questions about vitamins, fiber, minerals,  and other popular supplements.  Some of the material may be slightly too  technical for the average reader, but there is enough other material  presented to make it worthwhile reading.  Unfortunately, with all the data  available, most of us (myself included) are just too lazy to do what's best  for our health.  Even so, I recommend reading this new book. Every little  bit of knowledge that we can gain from it could be of long lasting benefit  to our health.	2000-04-30

I was pleasantly surprised that I really enjoyed reading this book and honestly gained things from it.  Maria gives insight into her views on life, and made me think seriously about some of the things she states and  what they would mean to me personally.  What she covers is applicable to  all of us, in all stages of life.  She deals with bosses, children, spouses  and everyone that touches our lives, how they influence us, what they  expect of us, and how we should react to gain the most from these  experiences.  She stresses the importance of laughter, and I agree that  humor is important in everyday life.  It's something that many folks  forget, and suffer because of it. I must admit that I hesitated reading  this book by a celebrity such as Maria, but I found it very worthwhile.  If  you're too busy to read it, it's available on audio cassette, so you can  listen to it in your car.  Each of us can benefit from it.	2000-04-28

She does after all have a better picture of what goes on behind closed White House doors than the rest of us.  Peggy emphasizes how  power hungry the Clintons are and the driving forces behind them.  Ms.  Noonan questions Hillary's ability to lead, and if she does in fact have  leadership qualities, why she has accomplished so little during her tenure  in the White House.  Peggy leads the reader to think that the New York  Senate race is just the first step to bigger and better positions.  It  provided me with food for thought and enouraged me to look further into  this political figure that will be with us for some time.  I found this  book interesting, enjoyable, and well worth reading.	2000-04-27
